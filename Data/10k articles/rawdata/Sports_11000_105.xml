The '''2012 Sydney Motorsport Park 360''' was a motor race for the Australian sedan-based [[V8 Supercars]]. It was the ninth event of the [[2012 International V8 Supercars Championship]].&lt;ref name="ticketek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://premier.ticketek.com.au/shows/show.aspx?sh=sydmotor12 |title=Sydney Motorsport Park 360 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was held on the weekend of 25–26 August at the [[Sydney Motorsport Park]], in [[Eastern Creek]], [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref name="ticketek"/&gt;

It was the first V8 Supercars event held at the circuit since [[2008 V8 Supercar Championship Series|2008]], when the circuit was known as '''Eastern Creek Raceway'''. The V8 Supercars used the traditional 3.93km Gardner Circuit as opposed to the new 4.7km Brabham Circuit. It was also the first of three events held in New South Wales and the last before the endurance races (the [[Sandown 500]], [[Bathurst 1000]] and [[Gold Coast 600]]).

Born in [[Zell am See]], [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], Schild specializes in [[slalom skiing|slalom]] and made her World Cup debut in March [[2008 Alpine Skiing World Cup|2008]] at [[Bormio]].

She is a younger sister of the champion skier [[Marlies Schild|Marlies Raich]] (b. 1981);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amersports.com/media/news/success_made_by_marlies/&lt;/ref&gt; they  twice shared a podium during the [[2014 Alpine Skiing World Cup|2014]] season, at Courchevel in December and [[Kranjska Gora]] in February.&lt;ref name=hdfigtw&gt;{{cite news|url=http://skiracing.com/stories/hansdotter-finally-gets-a-win-as-shiffrin-lets-one-go/|magazine=Ski Racing |last=Mintz|first=Geoff |title=Hansdotter finally gets a win, as Shiffrin lets one go |date=2 February 2014 |accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

U.S. Army Captain Frank Dux has trained from his youth in the ways of [[ninjutsu]] under his [[sensei]] Senzo Tanaka. He wants to take the place of Tanaka's deceased son Shingo in the illegal martial arts tournament ''Kumite'' in [[Hong Kong]], in order to honor his sensei. As a young boy, Dux and a group of his friends broke into Tanaka's home to steal a [[katana]], but Dux was apprehended while returning the katana to its place. Impressed by Dux's honesty and lack of fear, Senzo trained him together with Shingo. After Shingo's death, Senzo agreed to train Dux as a member of the Tanaka clan. When Dux's superiors learn of his invitation to the Kumite, they refuse to let him go. Dux goes [[absent without leave]] before saying goodbye to his sensei and leaving for Hong Kong. Two [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Criminal Investigation Command]] (CID) officers, Helmer and Rawlins, are assigned to track down and arrest Dux for [[desertion]].

After arriving in Hong Kong, Dux befriends American fighter Ray Jackson and Victor Lin, who becomes the manager of Jackson and Dux. The two Americans and Chong Li—the ruthless Kumite champion—all make it through the first day of the Kumite. Dux earns the enmity of Li after breaking his record for the fastest knockout. He becomes involved with American journalist Janice Kent, who attempts to investigate the secrets of Kumite but is shocked by its violence. On the second day of the tournament, Jackson is matched against Li. Although Jackson gains the upper hand, he gloats instead of finishing Li off. Li recovers and brutally beats Jackson, landing him in hospital. Dux vows to avenge Jackson. Kent tries to convince Dux to pull out of the tournament for his own safety, but he refuses.

On the last day of the competition, Dux is cornered by Helmer and Rawlins, but he defeats them and the local police. He promises to give himself up once the tournament is over. Dux advances to the tournament final to face Li, who alienated the audience by killing his semi-final opponent. Dux overpowers Li, but Li cheats by blinding him with a crushed salt pill. Dux uses his other senses as Senzo had taught him to overcome the handicap and defeat Li, becoming the first Western winner of the Kumite. After visiting Jackson in the hospital, he returns to the United States with the CID officers.

==Production==
Co-writer Sheldon Lettich came up with the idea for the film.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had known Frank Dux for a number of months before I came up with the idea for ''Bloodsport''. Frank told me a lot of tall tales, most of which turned out to be bullshit. But his stories about participating in this so-called "Kumite" event sounded like a great idea for a movie. There was one guy who he introduced me to, named Richard Bender, who claimed to have actually been at the Kumite event and who swore everything Frank told me was true. A few years later this guy had a falling-out with Frank, and confessed to me that everything he told me about the Kumite was a lie; Frank had coached him in what to say.&lt;ref name="asian movie pulse"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Brian|title=Q &amp; A with Sheldon Lettich By Marco A.

Producer Mark Di Salle said he was looking for "a new martial arts star who was a ladies' man, [but Van Damme] appeals to both men and women. He's an American hero who fights for justice the American way and kicks the stuffing out of the bad guys."&lt;ref name="jean"/&gt; ''Bloodsport'' is one of the few films featuring scenes filmed inside [[Kowloon Walled City]] before its destruction.&lt;ref name=cityofdarkness&gt;{{cite web|title=Popular Culture|url=http://cityofdarkness.co.uk/category/popular_culture/|website=Cityofdarkness.co.uk|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
{{unreferencedsect|date=January 2018}}
''Bloodsport''{{'}}s soundtrack score was composed by [[Paul Hertzog]], who also composed another Jean-Claude Van Damme film titled ''[[Kickboxer (film)|Kickboxer]]''. The soundtrack contains the songs "Fight to Survive" and "On My Own", both performed by [[Stan Bush]]. Bush's songs are replaced on the soundtrack with alternate versions sung by [[Paul Delph]], who was nominated for a [[Grammy]] for this work. The film plays the song "Steal the Night" by [[Michael Bishop (bassist)|Michael Bishop]] during a scene where Dux runs from Helmer and Rawlins. The song was not released until the mid-2000s, as a single containing a vocal and instrumental version. On June 26, 2007, [[Perseverance Records]] released a limited edition CD of the soundtrack including, for the first time, the original film versions of the Stan Bush songs.

'''Chepstow Racecourse''' is a [[thoroughbred horse racing]] [[racecourse|course]] located just north of the town of [[Chepstow]] in [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]], near the southern end of the [[Wye Valley]] and close to the border with England. It is one of 16 racecourses operated by the Arena Racing Company and is home of the richest race in Wales, the Coral Welsh Grand National.

==Track and facilities==
[[File:Chepstow Racecourse.jpg|thumb|250px|Chepstow racecourse]]
The track is a roughly oval circuit of just under {{convert|2|mi|m}}. It is a left-handed undulating course, used for both flat and jump racing. The finishing straight is about {{convert|5|furlong}} in length, with five fences on the chase course to be jumped.  There are eleven fences on a complete circuit.  There is also a straight mile course.

There are 32 fixtures in the 2017 calendar year including the new two-day Totepool Jumps Season Opener with £300,000 of prize money on Saturday 14th and Sunday 15 October. This meeting features the £50,000 Grade Three Tote Silver Trophy (Handicap Hurdle) and the £35,000 Grade Two Totepool Persian War Novices' Hurdle.

The £150,000 Coral Welsh Grand National takes place on Wednesday 27 December 2017. This meeting also features the Coral Future Champions Finale Juvenile Hurdle, one of only three Grade One juvenile hurdles in the calendar.

Chepstow is one of three racecourses in Wales, the others being at [[Bangor-on-Dee racecourse|Bangor-on-Dee]] and at [[Ffos Las racecourse|Ffos Las]]. It is also used as a venue for numerous other indoor and outdoor events, such as concerts, weddings and conferences.&lt;ref name="Racecourse"&gt;[http://www.chepstow-racecourse.co.uk/ Chepstow racecourse website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Several places in South Wales had race meetings in the late nineteenth century and there had been racing at [[St Arvans]], very close to the present course, between 1892 and 1914.&lt;ref name=lucas/&gt; In 1925 a group of ten South Wales gentry and businessmen, that included [[Courtenay Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar]] who was also [[Lord-Lieutenant of Monmouthshire]], and [[Lord Queenborough]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkhorseracing.co.uk/guides/chepstow_racecourse.html|title=Chepstow Racecourse|publisher=talkhorseracing.co.uk|accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed a company to purchase [[Piercefield House]], and lay out a new racecourse in its estate. Despite struggling to raise enough cash, the racecourse was opened on 6 August 1926. The first race was a two-year-old seller won by [[Lord Harewood]]'s colt Conca D'Oro, the 7-4 favourite. The two day flat race meeting had good prize money and was termed "The Welsh [[Glorious Goodwood|Goodwood]]".&lt;ref name=lucas&gt;Lucas, Pat.  1976.  Fifty Years of Racing at Chepstow. SBN 901906 14 X&lt;/ref&gt;

The course nearly had to close down immediately after the first meeting and survived only thanks to a large bank loan guaranteed by the directors.  Unforeseen extra costs in laying it out meant that it struggled financially for the first ten years of its existence and yet more contributions were needed from the directors.  The first jump racing took place in March 1927.  Since then the course has been used for flat racing in the summer and jumping in the winter.  To begin with, the flat racing was more prestigious, with the Welsh [[Derby]], [[Epsom Oaks|Oaks]] and [[St Leger]] being run for good prize money.  In 1933, at a two-day meeting, the multiple champion jockey [[Gordon Richards]] won eleven consecutive races at Chepstow – all six races on the first day and the first five races on the next, before being beaten in a close finish in the final race of the meeting.&lt;ref name=lucas/&gt;

During [[World War II|the Second World War]], the entire site became designated as '''RAF Chepstow''', an operational outpost of [[RAF St. Athan]], [[No. 32 Maintenance Unit RAF]]. Equipped with only a grass runway in the centre of the course, additional aircraft accommodation for bombers was created at Oakgrove on the opposite side of the road, accessed by stopping the traffic to allow the aircraft to cross. Types stationed on the course during the war included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piercefieldpark.co.uk/varticle38.aspx|title=Chepstow Racecourse and the Royal Airforce 1941/42|author=Neil Widdas|publisher=piercefieldpark.co.uk|year=2005|accessdate=2012-06-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107181549/http://www.piercefieldpark.co.uk/varticle38.aspx|archivedate=7 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar===
After the war and the demise of the nearby [[Caerleon]] course, the [[Welsh National]] was transferred to Chepstow in 1949. From then on, [[National Hunt racing]] overtook flat racing as the dominant activity as a string of good class horses and top trainers and jockeys contested the race.&lt;ref name=lucas/&gt;  The three and three-quarter mile race, more recently known as the Coral Welsh National, owes much to the support of the bookmaking firm for establishing it as one of the major events in the National Hunt calendar. It have sponsored it for over forty years, making it the second longest continuous race sponsorship.&lt;ref name="Racecourse"/&gt; 
[[File:Chepstow Racecourse - geograph.org.uk - 1286216.jpg|thumb|250px|Horse racing at Chepstow racecourse]]
The opening of the [[Severn Bridge]] and the completion of the [[M4 motorway]] made the course more accessible to English racegoers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Davies|editor1-link=John Davies (historian)|editor2-first=Nigel |editor2-last=Jenkins | editor2-link=Nigel Jenkins| editor3-first=Baines |editor3-last=Menna|editor4-first=Peredur I. |editor4-last=Lynch|title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |year=2008 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff |page=376 |isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clay family, which had bought Piercefield House in 1861, were involved with the management course since its formation.&lt;ref name=lucas/&gt; Listed on the [[Alternative Investment Market|AIM stock market]] as a [[Public limited company|plc]] in the late 1990s, [[Stanley Clarke (businessman)|Sir Stanley Clarke]] built up an 80% stake in the company and then [[reverse takeover|reversed]] his existing [[Northern Racing]] racecourse holdings into the shell. Clarke took over as executive chairman of the Racecourse Company in 2000, resigning in 2003 before his 2004 death from [[cancer]].  Chepstow is now part of the [[Arena Racing Company]], also called ARC Racing and Leisure Group a private UK company, created in 2012 by the merger of [[Arena Leisure]] and [[Northern Racing]]. It owns and operates several racecourses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arena Racing Company|website=arenaracingcompany.co.uk/news/story/71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyclops''' is a computer system co-invented by the British inventor Bill Carlton of [[Great Britain]] and Margaret Parnis England of Malta,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, John. [https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cyclops-has-company-as-machine-moves-to-replace-net-cord-judge-1583317.html Cyclops has company as machine moves to replace net cord judge]. ''[[The Independent]]'' (23 November 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; which is used on the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] and [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] professional [[tennis]] tours as an [[Electronic line judge (tennis)|electronic line judge]] to help determine whether a serve is in or out.

The system, which must be activated by the service line umpire before each serve, projects five or six [[infra-red]] horizontal beams of light along the court 10&amp;nbsp;mm above the ground.  One beam covers the good (short) side of the service line and others cover the fault (long) side. If a served ball hits the first beam, the other beams are turned off, while a long serve will break one of the other beams. A long serve is indicated by an audible signal.  Obvious long serves that go beyond Cyclops' beams are called by the service line umpire. 
The system is tuned before and during each tournament by a representative of the company which rents the system.  This representative stays through the tournament and confers with tournament officials afterwards to determine any problems which may have arisen. The system has been constantly refined to improve accuracy, although no statistics on its efficacy are available.&lt;ref&gt;Greenman, Catherine. [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/31/technology/for-us-open-tennis-a-service-line-umpire-that-never-blinks.html For U.S. Open Tennis, a Service Line Umpire That Never Blinks]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' (August 31, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/tennis/features/newsid_3001000/3001768.stm ''Sport Academy:'' Cyclops and speed guns] [[BBC]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cyclops computer system was introduced to the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon Championships]] in 1980 and the [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]] in 1981, and was also used at the [[Australian Open]].  In 2007 it was removed from Wimbledon's Centre Court and Court No. 1 to allow the use of the [[Hawk-Eye]] system first introduced at the U.S. Open in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Stevie. [http://www.monstersandcritics.com/sport/tennis/article_1296402.php/Cyclops_ousted_by_HawkEye_at_Wimbledon Cyclops ousted by HawkEye at Wimbledon] ''Tennis News'' (April 25, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; At the present time Cyclops is not used in any capacity at any of the Grand Slam events.

A famous moment involving Cyclops occurred at Wimbledon in 1980 when [[Ilie Năstase]] got down on his hands and knees to talk to the equipment to argue an "out" signal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3284">The '''Deutscher Sportclub für Fußballstatistiken e.V.''', (English: ''German sports club for football statistics'') short '''DSFS''' is an association dedicated to collecting and publishing [[German football]] [[statistics]], similar to the [[RSSSF]], and is a member of the [[German Olympic Society]].

The club used to be best known for its annual publication, the ''Deutscher Fussball-Almanach'', a yearbook on German football.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.weltbild.de/artikel/buch/deutscher-fussball-almanach-saison-2014-2015_20875380-1 Produkt-Beschreibung zu: Deutscher Fussball-Almanach 2014/2015] {{de icon}} [[Weltbild]] website - Book review, accessed: 23 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other yearbooks, it does not so much focus on professional football, but rather covers the higher amateur leagues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.de/review/R1RARQYUQ907TE Fussball - Mehr als nur Bundesliga] {{de icon}} Amazon.de - Book review, accessed: 2 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The DSFS was formed on 1 July 1971 but was only registered in 1979. It was formed by six football enthusiasts after Helmut Druwen posted an add in the ''[[Kicker (sports magazine)|kicker]]'' sport magazine looking for people interested in football statistics. Having grown to a membership of 50, another add in the ''kicker'' in 1978 pushed the membership drive ahead and in 1979 the club finally became properly registered, joining the German Olympic Society as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsfs.de/index.php?id=65 Epochen] {{de icon}} DSFS website, accessed: 2 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1980, the club started publishing brochures and a club magazine. But after 1983, the ''DSFS'' went into decline for the first time, recovering only in 1986 from several years of inactivity.

With the re-establishment of the ''[[Regionalliga (football)|Regionalliga]]'' in German football in 1994, a reform of the clubs annual publication was started. Year by year until 2004 the contents was expanded until covering all divisions of German football on the top five levels including the top youth and women's leagues. Consequently, the name ofthis annual publication was changed to ''Deutschlands Fussball in Zahlen'' (English: ''Germanys football by numbers'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://fussball-kultur.org/v01/de/pub/index.html?navID=108&amp;IDS=0ghLrtBg Deutsche Akademie für Fussball Kultur] {{de icon}} List of organisations and websites associated with football, accessed: 2 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, it was declared ''Gemeinnützig'', similar to a [[Non-profit organization]], which entitles German clubs to certain tax benefits. In 2004, the number of members was at its peak with almost 430 members. Since then the club lost several of them and now has approximately 363 members (2015 census).

As of September 2006, the clubs president is Dirk Henning.

==History==

===Original construction===
The initiative to build a new stadium was announced on October 7, 1961.  On that day,  [[List of East Carolina University administration|President]] [[Leo Jenkins]] announced to a meeting of [[Boosterism|boosters]], that a new stadium will be built to replace [[College Stadium]].  By 1962, over $280,000 was raised and Ficklen Memorial Stadium was built.&lt;ref name="Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium - Facilities"&gt;{{cite web| title = Dowdy–Ficklen Stadium| work = Facilities | publisher = East Carolina Pirates| year = 2010| url = http://www.ecupirates.com/facilities/ecu-facilities-dowdy.html| accessdate = August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stadium was named for James Skinner Ficklen, the owner of Greenville's E.B. Skinner Tobacco Company.  Skinner was a booster of the college, and established a scholarship fund in his name.&lt;ref name="Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium - Building Histories"&gt;{{cite web | title = Dowdy–Ficklen Stadium | work = Building Histories | publisher = Joyner Library | date = October 1, 2008 | url = http://media.lib.ecu.edu/archives/bldg_history.cfm?id=49 | accessdate = August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original stadium included permanent stands on the south side, a press box, and a lighting system.&lt;ref name="Growing Season"&gt;{{cite web | title = Growing Season - Football Stadium Expansion| work = Web Features| publisher = East Carolina University  | date = June 2, 2010 | url = http://www.ecu.edu/cs-admin/mktg/stadium_expansion.cfm | accessdate = August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ficklen Memorial Stadium opened on September 21, 1963 with a win against [[1963 Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team|Wake Forest]].&lt;ref name="Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium - Facilities"/&gt;  The original [[seating capacity]] was 10,000.&lt;ref name="Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium - Building Histories"/&gt;

===Early expansions===
The north side permanent seating was constructed in 1967 and 1968, increasing the capacity of the stadium to 20,000.&lt;ref name="Growing Season"/&gt;  The seats were designed by W.M. Freeman Associates from [[High Point, North Carolina|High Point]], [[North Carolina]].  The exterior of the stadium was painted in 1970 by F.A. Miller Company.&lt;ref name="Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium - Building Histories"/&gt;  The lighting system was the next item that changed.  The original lighting system was replaced with six towers outside of the stadium in 1975.  The cost of the new lighting system was $450,000.&lt;ref name="Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium - Facilities"/&gt;  L.E. Wooten company built the lighting system.&lt;ref name="Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium - Building Histories"/&gt;

The next addition occurred two years later.  The university added seats to the four corners increased the [[seating capacity]] to 35,000.  This addition made Ficklen Memorial Stadium the third largest stadium in North Carolina.&lt;ref name="Growing Season"/&gt; The expansion was funded by a $2.5 million drive in the spring of 1977.  The three-story press box which is currently in use was built during that expansion.  The press box had space for 92 writers and an entire floor for electronic media. Lastly, scoreboard with a lightbank message center was placed on the east end of the stadium. The playing surface was redone in 1983.  A new drainage system, new base of gravel and sand, new treated topsoil, and a new grass—[[Cynodon_dactylon#Varieties|Tifton 419]] Hybrid Bermuda were all installed.&lt;ref name="Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium - Facilities"/&gt;  A new sound system was built in 1988.&lt;ref name="Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium - Building Histories"/&gt;

===1990s expansions===
[[File:DowdyFicklenStadium3.jpg|thumb|right|Dowdy–Ficklen press box side in 2008]]
In 1991, $1.6 million in renovations and repairs were accomplished on the stadium.&lt;ref name="Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium - Building Histories"/&gt;

Ronald and Mary Ellen Dowdy of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]], donated one million dollars during a fund-raising drive in 1994.  Because of this donation, Ficklen Memorial Stadium was renamed Dowdy–Ficklen Stadium.&lt;ref name="Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium - Facilities"/&gt;  Also that year the roads were improved around the stadium.&lt;ref name="Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium - Building Histories"/&gt;  A year later, Al and Debbie Bagwell of [[Lake Gaston]], [[Virginia]] donated to the East Carolina Educational Foundation.  Because of this donation, the field inside the stadium was named Bagwell Field.&lt;ref name="Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium - Facilities"/&gt;

The upper deck on the north side was completed in 1998.  It increased the capacity to 40,000.  This was the first [[seating capacity]] increase since 1977.  A year later the club level on the north side was completed.  It added 3,000 seats to the total capacity.&lt;ref name="Growing Season"/&gt;  During the expansion of the upper deck and club level, the press box received improvements.&lt;ref name="Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium - Building Histories"/&gt;  In 1999, a $2 million scoreboard was built in the east endzone.&lt;ref name="Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium - Facilities"/&gt;  Also that year a Pirate sculpture was dedicated in the southeast area of the stadium.  The three-ton bronze sculpture is over {{convert|20|ft|m}} tall.  Irwin Belk gave the sculpture to the school.  Jodi Hollnagel, a faculty member of the [[College of Fine Arts and Communication at East Carolina University#The School of Art and Design|School of Art]] created the sculpture.&lt;ref name="Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium - Building Histories"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Minges Coliseum/Williams Arena - Building Histories"&gt;{{cite web | title = Minges Coliseum/Williams Arena| work = Building Histories | publisher = Joyner Library | date = October 1, 2008 | url = http://media.lib.ecu.edu/archives/bldg_history.cfm?id=99 | accessdate = August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murphy Center construction===
[[File:2011 Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium - Murphy Center.jpg|thumb|right|The Murphy Center in the west endzone.]]
The $13 million Murphy Center was dedicated on September 13, 2002.  It was built in the west endzone of the stadium.  It connects the stadium to [[Williams Arena at Minges Coliseum]].  The {{convert|52475|sqft|m2|adj=on}} strength and conditioning, banquet rooms, sport memorabilia, and an academic enhancement center building was named for Pete and Lynn Murphy of [[Rose Hill, North Carolina|Rose Hill]], [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ECU Pirates Official Athletic Site |url=http://www.ecupirates.com/facilities/?id=7 |title=Murphy Center |publisher=ecupirates.com |accessdate=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009–2010 expansion===
The next expansion began in December 2009.  The expansion included removing the scoreboard located in the east end zone. 7,000 seats were built in its place.  The seats connect the north and south sides in a horseshoe pattern.  Those seats increased the capacity to 50,000.  Restroom and concession stands were built under the new section.  Above the east end zone, a new scoreboard was built.  The high-definition scoreboard is {{convert|88|ft|m}} wide and a little over {{convert|28|ft|m}} tall.  The LED portion is {{convert|84|ft|m}} wide.&lt;ref name="Growing Season"/&gt;  This makes the new scoreboard the 22nd largest scoreboard in [[Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision]].  On the north and south sides of the stadium, 10,200 chair-back seats were installed.  Lastly,  another scoreboard was built on the west end zone in front of the Murphy Center.&lt;ref name="Growing Season"/&gt;  The total cost of the expansion was $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Gibson| first = Todd | title = ECU Set To Unveil $20M Stadium Expansion| publisher = NBC17| date = August 3, 2010| url = http://news.mync.com/site/news/story/54020/sports-ecu-set-to-unveil-20m-stadium-expansion/| accessdate = August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marshall University plane crash==
On November 14, 1970, the visiting [[Marshall University]] [[Marshall Thundering Herd football|Thundering Herd]] lost a game 17-14 to the Pirates at Dowdy–Ficklen Stadium, which ended with Marshall [[quarterback]] Ted Shoebridge controversially being called for [[intentional grounding]] on the last play of the game.  Later that evening, while on approach to [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]] [[Tri-State Airport]], the Marshall football team's [[Southern Airways Flight 932|plane]], which had been chartered to transport the Thundering Herd to and from Greenville, crashed, killing all 75 people on board.

On December 11, 2006, a [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] was erected at the visitors' entrance to Dowdy–Ficklen Stadium.  It depicts the memorial fountain on the Marshall University campus.

'''Estadio Sausalito''' ({{IPA-es|sausaˈlito}}; Sausalito Stadium) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Viña del Mar]], [[Chile]].

It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and is the home ground of [[Corporación Deportiva Everton de Viña del Mar|CD Everton]].  The stadium holds 22,360 people, was built in 1929 and completely renovated in 2015. The stadium has hosted the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]], two times the [[Copa América]] ([[1991 Copa América|1991]] and [[2015 Copa América|2015]]) and a [[FIFA U-17 World Cup]].

The name comes from the nearby Sausalito lagoon.

== History ==
[[File:Estadio Saualito during Copa America, Jun 2015.jpg|260px|thumbnail|Estadio Sausalito before a [[2015 Copa América]] match between [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] on 20 June.]]
It was built during [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]] government in 1929.

In 1960, the stadium was practically destroyed by the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake|Valdivia earthquake]], but the rapid reconstruction financed by the municipality did that the ground was chosen as one of the venues to held the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]] where hosted all the games of the Group C as well as one during the quarterfinals and semifinals respectively.

In 1991, ''Sausalito'' returned to international football, after appearing as one of the four venues in the [[1991 Copa América|Copa América]] of that year, alongside [[Santiago]], [[Valparaíso]] and [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]].

On 19 July 2012, [[President of Chile]] [[Sebastián Piñera]] announced a reshuffle to the stadium to host the [[2015 Copa América]] and the [[2015 FIFA U-17 World Cup|FIFA U-17 World Cup]] of the same year, which started during his government and finished few days before the Copa América during [[Michelle Bachelet]] government.

==International matches==
As one of the venues for the [[1962 World Cup]], the Estadio Sausalito hosted eight matches including the semi-final between [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]. It was also one of four venues to host matches during the [[Copa América 1991]], and it will be one of the eight venues to host matches during the [[Copa América 2015]].

The '''Falkirk Stadium''' is a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Falkirk]], central [[Scotland]], which is the home ground of [[Scottish Championship]] club, [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]]. The stadium has a capacity of {{SPFL-stadiums|falkirk}}&lt;ref name="capacity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/clubs/falkirk/ |title=Falkirk Football Club|publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently consists of three fully completed stands.

The stadium was opened in 2004 with the main stand completed. It became the home of Falkirk in the same year after the club ground shared [[Ochilview Park]] for the 2003&amp;ndash;04 season whilst the stadium was being constructed. The north and south stands were built and opened in 2005 and 2009 respectively.

==History==
{{See also|Falkirk F.C.#History|label 1=History of Falkirk F.C.}}

Work began on building the stadium in 2003&lt;ref name="approved"&gt;[http://www.falkirkherald.co.uk/news/local-headlines/falkirk_stadium_approved_now_work_begins_1_292118 Falkirk Stadium approved ... now work begins], ''[[Falkirk Herald]]''. 20 March 2003. Retrieved 10 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Brockville Park]], the club's town centre home since 1885, was sold and demolished.&lt;ref name="sold"&gt;[http://www.falkirkherald.co.uk/news/local-headlines/163_9_million_deal_agreed_for_brockville_1_291666 £9 million deal agreed for Brockville], ''[[Falkirk Herald]]''. 19 July 2002. Retrieved 10 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project of building the stadium was a partnership between Falkirk Football Club and [[Falkirk Council]] who set up the Falkirk Community Stadium Ltd which provided the funds to construct and run the stadium.&lt;ref name="partnership end"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/tayside_and_central/7923473.stm |title=Football stadium venture to end |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=4 March 2009 |accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falkirk Council estimated £6.1 million would be required for the first stage of the Community Stadium build and would contribute £3.1 million initially. The sale of Brockville Park amounted to £9 million [[pound sterling|pounds]] for the club, of which £2.8 million went towards the build, whilst £200,000 came from [[sportscotland]].

The first stage of the stadium was completed in time for the [[2004–05 in Scottish football|2004&amp;ndash;05 football season]] and Falkirk moved in after spending the previous year [[groundshare|ground-sharing]] with local rivals, [[Stenhousemuir F.C.|Stenhousemuir]] at their [[Ochilview Park]] home.
[[File:Falkirk Stadium West Stand.jpg|350px|thumb|left|The facade of the West Stand]]

Furthermore, the stadium was used for a short time by [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] as their own [[Hampden Park]] stadium was in use for the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Olympic football competitions]]. {{As of|2014}}, the all-seated capacity of Firhill is {{SPFL-stadiums|partick}}.&lt;ref name="capacity"/&gt;

==History==
[[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] played at various sites between 1876 and 1891, including Kelvingrove, Jordanvale Park and Muir Park.&lt;ref name = "inglis459"&gt;{{harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=459}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club settled at Meadowside, beside the [[River Clyde]], in 1891.&lt;ref name = "inglis459"/&gt; They were forced out of this site in 1908, however, to make way for a shipyard.&lt;ref name = "inglis459"/&gt; The club found some spare [[Caledonian Railway]] land in Maryhill, the site was purchased by the club for £5,500, and construction started soon after.&lt;ref name = "inglis459"/&gt; The ground was due to open on 21 August 1909, but the match was postponed because it had not been declared safe for public use and planning consent had not been obtained.&lt;ref name = "inglis459"/&gt; Firhill opened a month later. [[File:JHS@Firhill.jpg|3.10MBpx|thumbnail|left|The Jackie Husband Stand]]
 
The record attendance for a Partick Thistle game at Firhill was set against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in 1922, when 49,838 people attended.&lt;ref name = "sfgg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UZdAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=O6UMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4213%2C5978461 |title=Association Football. A Firhill record |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=20 February 1922 |page=12 |accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present main stand was constructed in 1927, at which time the terraces were expanded.&lt;ref name = "inglis459"/&gt; Although the main stand resembles an [[Archibald Leitch]] design, it was in fact designed by David Mills Duncan, who had previously worked for Leitch.&lt;ref name = "inglis459"/&gt; The stadium's attendance record was set by the [[1928 British Home Championship]] match between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[Ireland national football team (1882&amp;ndash;1950)|Ireland]], when 54,728 people attended.&lt;ref name = "inglis459"/&gt;

[[File:Firhill_Stadium_(PTFC_vs_St_Mirren).jpg|thumb|right|View of the Colin Weir Stand (left) and the [[John Lambie (footballer, born 1940)|John Lambie]] Stand (right)]]

There were no further improvements until the early 1950s, when Thistle had a relatively successful period.&lt;ref name = "inglis459"/&gt; This success financed a roof over part of the terracing and floodlights, which were first used in a [[friendly match]] against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in November 1955.&lt;ref name = "inglis459"/&gt; Firhill hosted the first [[European Cup]] match ever to be played in Glasgow, when [[Sweden|Swedish]] club [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgården]] played their "home" match against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in [[1955–56 European Cup|1955–56]]. Djurgårdens played at Firhill because of the freezing conditions in Sweden at the time of the match.

Firhill became designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act in 1977, which reduced its capacity from over 40,000 to 20,500.&lt;ref name = "inglis459"/&gt; In 1986, Firhill became the first Scottish ground in modern times to be used by more than one team, when [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]] moved in after being evicted from [[Shawfield Stadium|Shawfield]].&lt;ref name = "inglis459"/&gt; This arrangement lasted until 1991.&lt;ref name = "inglis459"/&gt; [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]] then shared Firhill with Thistle in two different spells, the first arrangement beginning in 1994.&lt;ref name = "inglis459"/&gt; To cope with the resulting additional usage, undersoil heating was installed in 1994.&lt;ref name = "inglis459"/&gt;

The North Stand was built in 2002 to meet the [[Scottish Premier League]] criteria on stadium capacity, which stated at the time that member clubs must have 10,000 seats in their ground. Ironically this criterion was later changed to only 6,000 seats, which not only allowed for the relegation of Partick Thistle, but meant they had constructed a stand which cost the club unnecessarily. Originally, the stand only ran for two thirds the length of the pitch, but it was extended in 2003. The construction of this stand was assisted by the sale of some land to allow the construction of student flats which now lie behind the stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green light for Firhill revamp|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/partick_thistle/1360301.stm|website=www.news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and facilities==
[[File:Firhill 4.jpg|thumb|The [[John Lambie (footballer, born 1940)|John Lambie]] (north) Stand|right]] [[File:Firhill Seating Plan.jpg|thumbnail|left]]
The modern stadium comprises three seated stands, with an unused area at the south end. The current capacity of the ground includes {{SPFL-stadiums|partick}}&lt;ref name="capacity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/clubs/partick/ |title=Partick Thistle Football Club|publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; seats with no standing areas available. The Main Stand was built with an original capacity of 6,000 seats, however in recent times only around 3,000 of which have been used.  In January 2006, the club announced that the Main Stand would no longer be used on matchdays due to high maintenance and stewarding costs. There were exceptions to this, such as a [[Scottish Cup]] match against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and for Glasgow Warriors matches against [[Edinburgh rugby|Edinburgh]]. When Thistle achieved promotion to the [[Scottish Premiership]] in 2013, the Main Stand was reopened to house away supporters, and has been used for this purpose ever since. The Main Stand was renamed the Colin Weir Stand in 2016 in tribute to the club's first ever patron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14516236.Main_Stand_at_Firhill_to_be_renamed_in_honour_of_Partick_Thistle_supporter/ |title=Main Stand at Firhill to be renamed in honour of Partick Thistle supporter |first=Catriona |last=Stewart |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |date=29 November 2007 |accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Firhill at night.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Colin Weir (main) Stand]]

All home fans are now housed in the stand opposite the old stand, the Jackie Husband Stand. The stand is a large [[cantilever]] building, and was constructed in December 1994 with a capacity of 6,263 and is named after former Thistle player [[Jackie Husband]]. The newest stand is the north stand, at one end of the ground. This was built in 2002 to replace the old terracing, in order to comply with [[Scottish Premier League|SPL]] standards. This has a capacity of 2,014, houses Thistle's singing section&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement re Segregation Next Season|url=http://ptfc.co.uk/news/2013-2014/june_2013/statement_re_segregation_next_season|website=www.ptfc.co.uk|publisher=Partick Thistle Football Club|accessdate=8 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108134604/http://ptfc.co.uk/news/2013-2014/june_2013/statement_re_segregation_next_season|archivedate=8 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named after former Thistle manager [[John Lambie (footballer, born 1940)|John Lambie]] in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43823724 |title=John Lambie: Partick Thistle's North Stand renamed after late former manager |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=19 April 2018 |accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future developments==
In 2010, Thistle had announced plans to replace the disused terracing at the south end of the ground, commonly known as the "City End" with a new structure that would consist of a 1,000-seat stand as well as residential and office accommodation. However, planning permission from Glasgow City Council was not forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ptfc.co.uk/pressbox/news.asp?id=571 |title=News – Partick Thistle Football Club |publisher=Ptfc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006134243/http://ptfc.co.uk/pressbox/news.asp?id=571 |archivedate=6 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The grassy bank at the City End has come to be known by the fans as "The Bing".

On 7 November 2014, it was announced that planning permission had been submitted to [[Glasgow City Council]] to redevelop the southern end of the stadium. On this site, a new 450-seater stand will be built, complete with 79 residential flats and also office and retail space. The proposals are identical to those issued to the council in July 2010. Tim Clark of ZM Architecture, the company handling the application, stated: "The timescale for concluding the original consent has now ceased and our client wishes to resubmit the original application as they still have intentions to develop the site, which was interrupted by the downturn in the financial market in the intervening years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bateman|first1=David|title=Application proposes to build fourth stand at Partick Thistle's Firhill|url=http://glasgow.stv.tv/articles/298742-proposals-to-make-partick-thistles-firhill-a-four-sided-stadium/|website=www.glasgow.stv.tv|publisher=STV Media|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rugby League===
In 1996, Firhill was the site of the Scottish national rugby league team's first game on home soil, with a victory against [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]]. Rugby league, very much a minority sport in Scotland, has returned to the ground on several occasions since, including for the [[2000 Rugby League World Cup|2000 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Welch|first1=Adrian|title=Firhill Stadium, Glasgow: Partick Thistle|url=http://www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/firhill-stadium|website=www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greyhound racing===
Greyhound Racing took place from 1928 until 1957. An oval greyhound circuit 400 yards in circumference was added to the stadium around the football pitch in 1928 and a totalisator board was erected above the second bend between terracing. The racing started on 23 April 1928 as an independent (unlicenced) track &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|page =417|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the joining of the British Greyhound Tracks Control Society (BGTCS) in 1933.

Licensed racing started on Monday 23 January 1933 with a hastily arranged meeting; greyhounds had only qualifying to race on the previous Thursday, Friday and Saturday trial sessions. The company responsible for the greyhound racing was the Firhill Greyhound Racing Company Limited and their managing director was John Bilsland, the same man that formed part of syndicates responsible for opening Southend-on-Sea (Kursaal) and having interests in three Liverpool greyhound tracks. Racing took place at Firhill every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday at 7.45pm with races held over 280 and 480 yards (mainly handicaps).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Firhill's First Meeting, Monday 23 January|year=1933|newspaper=Official Racecard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extra revenue helped Partick Thistle overcome serious financial difficulties and when the BGTCS disbanded in 1935 the stadium management
headed by David Mitchell and W I Bilsland joined the [[National Greyhound Racing Club]] (NGRC) and continued to capitalise on a greyhound racing boom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Particulars of Licensed tracks, table 1 Licensed Dog Racecourses|year=1946|publisher=Licensing Authorities}}&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1950 falling attendances and competition from other Glasgow tracks forced Firhill to resign from their NGRC affiliation. The chairman John Bilsland stated that the cost of NGRC membership exceeded £1,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five Tracks Resign From NGRS, Thursday 23 March, no 8, vol 5|year=1950|newspaper=Greyhound Owner and Breeder}}&lt;/ref&gt; During January 1957 Racing Manager Ernest Ganly announced that the track was going to close to greyhound racing. He blamed falling attendances but the owner trainers disagreed citing the policy of only running company owned greyhounds at the track as being the main cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Firhill closes, Thursday 24 January|year=1957|newspaper=Greyhound Owner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
Firhill was used heavily in 2000 as a location for the television series ''[[Taggart]]'' in the episode "Football Crazy", in which the fictional team Strathclyde F.C. wore the same kits as Thistle and played at the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Locations: Firhill Stadium|url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Partick+Thistle+Football+Club%2C+Maryhill%2C+Glasgow%2C+Strathclyde%2C+Scotland%2C+UK&amp;ref_=tt_dt_dt|website=www.imdb.com|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium also featured in the BBC television drama [[Single Father (TV series)|''Single Father'']] starring Scottish actor [[David Tennant]].

==Transport==

[[Maryhill railway station]], which is served by trains from [[Glasgow Queen Street railway station|Glasgow Queen Street]], is the closest railway station to Firhill.&lt;ref name = "sfgg"/&gt; The walk between the two sites takes between 20 and 25 minutes.&lt;ref name = "sfgg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballgroundguide.com/scotland/partick_thistle.htm |accessdate=14 July 2012 |title=Partick Thistle|publisher=Scottish Football Ground Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firhill is better served by the [[Glasgow Subway]] network, with [[Kelvinbridge subway station|Kelvinbridge]] and [[St George's Cross subway station|St George's Cross]] stations within 15 minutes walk of the stadium.&lt;ref name = "sfgg"/&gt; The [[A81 road]] (Maryhill Road), leading to Firhill Road, runs from the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8 motorway]].&lt;ref name = "sfgg"/&gt;

'''Footvolley''' ({{lang-pt|Futevôlei}}, {{IPA-pt|futʃⁱˈvolej|IPA}} in Brazil, ''Futevólei'' {{IPA-pt|ˌfutɨˈvɔlɐj|IPA}} in Portugal) is a [[sport]] which combines aspects of [[beach volleyball]] and [[association football]].&lt;ref name='WOODS'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-143726711/footvolley-hot-sport-south.html |title=Footvolley hot sport in South Beach: |accessdate=2010-01-29 |last=Woods |first=Casey |date=March 27, 2006 |work=[[Miami Herald]] |publisher=Miami Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Footvolley was created by Octavio de Moraes in 1965 in Brazil.&lt;ref name='PVTLN'/&gt; Footvolley combines field rules that are based on those of [[beach volleyball]] with ball-touch rules taken from [[association football]]. Essentially footvolley is beach volleyball except players are not allowed to use their [[hand]]s and a [[football (association football)|football]] replaces the [[Volleyball (ball)|volleyball]].&lt;ref name='USFA'/&gt;

==History==
Footvolley was created by Octavio de Moraes in 1965&lt;ref name='PVTLN'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footvolley.net/news.php?nsid=17 |title=Birthplace of Footvolley to Host Olympic Games! |accessdate=2010-01-29 |work=Pro Footvolley Tour, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana Beach]]. The game of footvolley was first called 'pevoley', literally meaning "footvolley", but that name was discarded in favor of"futevôlei". Footvolley started in Rio de Janeiro, according to one player because football was banned on the beach, but volleyball courts were open.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/07/30/488057935/volleyball-plus-soccer-makes-footvolley |title=Volleyball Plus Soccer Makes Footvolley |publisher=Npr.org |date=2016-07-30 |accessdate=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sport had spread to [[Recife]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Brasília]], [[Goiânia]], [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]] and [[Florianópolis]] by the 1970s.
[[File:Futevôlei (5748540512).jpg|thumb|300px|Footvolley in Rio de Janeiro.]]

Teams of footvolley had five a side at first. Due to the skill level of the footvolley athletes (nearly all were professional football players), the ball would rarely drop. The players began lowering the number of players on each side, eventually settling on 2 versus 2, which is still in use today.&lt;ref name='FVBRH'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futevolei.com.br/Historia.html |title=Futevolei Historia |accessdate=2010-01-29 |work=Futevolei.com.br }} ''[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pt&amp;u=http://www.futevolei.com.br/Historia.html&amp;ei=9zljS9ukC4eXtgepss24Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBAQ7gEwAA&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://www.futevolei.com.br/Historia.html%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DG%26num%3D50 English translation]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, professional football players have taken up footvolley in both promotional events and celebrity matches. Some notable [[List of Brazilian footballers|Brazilian footballers]] who have played (or still play) footvolley are: [[Romário]], [[Edmundo Alves de Souza Neto|Edmundo]], [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], [[Ronaldinho|Ronaldinho Gaúcho]], [[Leovegildo Lins da Gama Júnior|Júnior]], and [[Edino Nazareth Filho|Edinho]] (1982 &amp; 1986 National Team).&lt;ref name='SPLAY'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footvolley.com/players.html |title=Footvolley Players |accessdate=2010-02-02 |publisher=Footvolley.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first International Footvolley event to occur outside of Brazil was in 2003 by the United States Footvolley Association on Miami Beach at the 2003 Fitness Festival. This event led to international players and teams in pursuit of federation status. A tournament was held during the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in Rio, as a demonstration sport.

== The Footvolleyball ==
An indoor footvolleyball looks like a basketball, but at only 360g, it is smaller in diameter, bouncier, and heavier than a volleyball.

==Rules==
Footvolley combines field rules that are based on those of [[beach volleyball]] with ball-touch rules taken from [[association football]]. Essentially footvolley is beach volleyball except players are not allowed to use their [[hand]]s and a [[football (association football)|football]] replaces the [[Volleyball (ball)|volleyball]].&lt;ref name='USFA'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usafootvolley.org/Official%20Footvolley%20Rules.html |title=United States Footvolley Association Official Game Rules |accessdate=2010-01-29 |work=United States Footvolley Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International rules===
Points are awarded if the ball hits the ground in the opponents court, if the opponents commit a fault, or if they fail to return the ball over the net. Scoring is done using the rally point system (new [[volleyball rules]]). Match scoring is usually up to the event organizer's discretion. Generally speaking matches are one set to 18 points; or best of three sets to 15 points (with third set to 11 points). The court is 29.5&amp;nbsp;feet x 59&amp;nbsp;ft (old beach volleyball). The height of the net varies based on the competition. The Official International Rule for the net height set is 2.2&amp;nbsp;meters or 7&amp;nbsp;feet 2&amp;nbsp;inches for the men's competition. For the women's competition, the height of the net should be set at 2&amp;nbsp;meters or 6&amp;nbsp;feet 6&amp;nbsp;inches.

==International growth==

'''Irina Natanovna Press'''{{#tag:ref|{{lang-ru|Ирина Натановна Пресс}}, {{lang-uk|Ірина Натанівна Пресс}}, ''Iryna Natanivna Press''|group=nb}} (10 March 1939 – 21 February 2004) was a multitalented [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] athlete who competed at the 1960 and 1964 Olympics. In 1960 she won a gold medal in the 80 m hurdles and finished fourth in the 4 × 100 m relay. In 1964 she finished fourth in the hurdles and sixth in the shot put, but won gold in the newly introduced pentathlon event.&lt;ref name=sr&gt;[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/pr/irina-press-1.html Irina Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519042410/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/pr/irina-press-1.html |date=19 May 2015 }}. sports-reference.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/475328/Irina-Press |title=Irina Press (Soviet athlete) |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |publisher=Britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1463233/Irina-Press.html |title=Irina Press |publisher=Telegraph |date=31 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with her elder sister [[Tamara Press|Tamara]], Irina set 26 world records between 1959 and 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sporting-heroes.net/athletics/u-s-s-r/tamara-press-1532/1960-and-1964-olympic-shot-put-champion_a09572/ Tamara PRESS – U.S.S.R. – 1960 and 1964 Olympic Shot Put champion]. Sporting Heroes&lt;/ref&gt; The careers of both Press sisters ended abruptly at the time that [[Gender verification in sports|gender verification]] was organized at the location of the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/2006-12/20/content_763254.htm |title=Gender testing in sport|publisher=Reuters|date=20 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have suggested that the Press sisters were male or [[intersex]]. Another allegation was that they were being injected with male hormones in order to make them stronger. Detractors called them the "Press Brothers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/080822.html "Switch hitter: If a man has a sex change can he compete in the Olympics as a woman?" [[thestraightdope.com]]; 22 August 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring from competitions Press earned a degree in physical education and coached at her club Dynamo Moscow. She also took various posts in the Soviet sports administration, such as department head of the Soviet and later Russian State Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Tourism. From 2000 and until her death in 2004 she headed the Moscow Committee of Physical Culture and Sports.&lt;ref name=sr/&gt;

The '''North American Association of Sports Economists''' (NAASE) is an organization that promotes and facilitates research and teaching in the economics of sports. NAASE was founded in 2007.  The organization emerged from the many sessions focused on sports economics at the Western Economic Association International (WEAI) meetings held throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.  NAASE maintains a close relationship to the WEAI and the annual NAASE business meeting takes place at this conference.  Although many NAASE members are academics, membership is open to anyone with an interest in sports economics, and NAASE counts undergraduate and graduate students in economics and other related disciplines like sport management as members, as well as non-economists with an interest in sports economics.  Despite the regional scope implied by its name, NAASE has members from around the world, and many past and current officers have been from outside North America. NAASE currently has around 100 members.

==Journals==
The ''[[Journal of Sports Economics]]'' has been published in association with NAASE since 2008, and NAASE members receive discounted subscriptions to the journal.  Beginning in February 2009, the ''Journal of Sports Economics'' began publishing an annual volume dedicated to papers from NAASE sponsored sessions at the Western Economic Association annual conference.

==Officers==

* President: Brad R. Humphreys, [[West Virginia University]]
* Past-President: Dennis Coates, [[UMBC]]
* President-Elect: [[David Berri]], [[Southern Utah University]]
* Secretary: Stacy Brook, [[University of Iowa]]
* Treasurer: John Solow, [[University of Iowa]]
* Vice Presidents: Peter von Allmen, [[Moravian College]], Craig Depken, [[University of North Carolina - Charlotte]], Anthony Krautmann, [[DePaul University]], Michael Leeds, [[Temple University]], Robert Simmons, [[Lancaster University]]

==Activities==
NAASE sponsors sessions at numerous academic conferences, including the Western Economic Association International conference, the [[Southern Economic Association]] conference and the Eastern Economic Association conference.  NAASE also sponsors a listserv to promote interaction among researchers in sports economics.

NAASE, in conjunction with the International Association of Sports Economists, operates a working paper series that is part of Research Papers in Economics ([[Repec]]).

==Awards==
NAASE confers an award every four years, the Larry Hadley Service Award, to recognize outstanding service to the field of sports economics.  The first Larry Hadley Service Award will be given at the WEAI Annual Conference in Portland, Oregon in July 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1818">The '''Prince original graphite''', or the “POG” as it is called, or “The Original G” is a [[tennis racquet]] manufactured by [[Prince Sports]]. It was first introduced in 1980 and has been used by numerous world-class tennis players, including [[Andre Agassi]], [[Michael Chang]], [[Gabriela Sabatini]], and [[Monica Seles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/wall-street-journal/finding-the-spin/story-fnay3ubk-1226410204866?nk=ff5b5e1a7e3b23eca0390c14fd756c7e |title=Finding the spin may be a racquet |publisher=''The Australian'' |date=June 30, 2012 |first=Tom |last= Perrotta |accessdate=September 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Graphite is a full-weighted tennis racquet with a box-shaped 19&amp;nbsp;mm beam, characterized by the Cross Bar Stabilizer, which reduces twisting on off-center hits. Most, if not all, versions were offered in either mid-size or oversized head.  The racquet also featured a signature foam handle with a leather grip.

Prince produced various versions of this racquet from the original in 1978 until 2016, including the
Prince Graphite (The very original version with single-stripe, teardrop-shaped head, and grommetless; c. 1978),
Prince Graphite (The second issue with single-stripe, teardrop-shaped head, but with single grommets; c. 1980)
Prince Graphite (Single-stripe version, with normal-shaped head and grommets from now on; c. 1983),
Prince Graphite (Four-Stripe version; c. 1987),
Prince Straight Shaft, 
Prince Graphite Tour and the Prince Classic Graphite.

[[Image:Slidetackle.JPG|thumb|292px|right|Sliding tackle performed by the player in black.]]
A '''sliding tackle''' or '''slide tackle''' is a [[Tackle (football move)|tackle]] in [[association football]]. It is completed with one leg extended to push the ball away from the opposing player.
Sliding tackles can often be sources of controversy, particularly when players being tackled fall down over the tackler's foot (or the ball stopped by the tackler's foot), and penalties, free kicks and cards are assessed (or are conspicuous by their absence).

==Commonly associated fouls and misconduct==

A sliding tackle is not in itself foul play; however, there are a number of [[foul (football)|foul]]s that commonly occur during the execution of a sliding tackle.

Examples of such fouls punishable by a [[direct free kick]] or [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] include:
*When a player in a manner considered by the referee to be ''careless, reckless or using excessive force'':
**kicks or attempts to kick an opponent;
**trips or attempts to trip an opponent;
**jumps at an opponent;
**charges an opponent;
**tackles an opponent.
''Careless'' means that the player has shown a lack of attention of consideration when making a challenge or that he acted without precaution. ''Reckless'' means that the player has acted with complete disregard to the danger to, or consequences for, his opponent. ''Using excessive force'' means that the player has far exceeded the necessary use of force and is in danger of injuring an opponent.&lt;ref name="lotg"&gt;https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/footballdevelopment/refereeing/02/36/01/11/27%5f06%5f2014%5fnew--lawsofthegameweben%5fneutral.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

''Careless'' challenges are punished by only a [[direct free kick]] or [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]. However, ''reckless'' challenges are also punished with a caution (yellow card) for unsporting behaviour as well as a [[direct free kick]] or [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]], while challenges committed with ''excessive force'' are also punished with a send-off (red card) for serious foul play as well as a [[direct free kick]] or [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]].&lt;ref name="lotg" /&gt;

''Playing in a dangerous manner'' is punishable by an [[indirect free kick]]. ''Playing in a dangerous manner'' is defined as any action, that while trying to play the ball, threatens injury to someone (including the player himself). It is committed with an opponent nearby and prevents the opponent from playing the ball for fear of injury. If any physical contact is made, the offence becomes an offence punishable with a [[direct free kick]] or [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]].&lt;ref name="lotg" /&gt;

Slide tackles that are made as two-footed lunges at an opponent are generally considered to endanger the safety of an opponent and are hence sanctioned as serious foul play, resulting in a sending-off. This is still the case even if the ball is won cleanly without touching an opponent.&lt;ref name="lotg" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2092434/Two-footed-challenges-red-cards.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
[[File:Steven Gerrard and Federico Balzaretti England-Italy Euro 2012.jpg|thumb|right|292px|[[Federico Balzaretti]] (blue) slide tackles [[Steven Gerrard]] (white) at [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]].]]
The slide tackle is attractive to the [[Defender (football)|defender]] because it allows him to cover a larger area of ground while attempting to dispossess an opponent. It is often a "last-ditch" attempt to dispossess an opponent due to frequent misses and the difficulty of recovering in the event that the slide tackle fails to take the ball away. After a slide tackle, the tackler is left sitting or lying on the ground with one leg extended. The tackler therefore also runs the risk of personal injury. Ideally, the other foot ends up folded underneath their rear end, where it can be used to push the tackler back up to their feet to continue play.

If doing a sliding tackle to the right, the player's right leg must be straight when going down into the tackle and their left leg should be bent slightly behind the right one in order to achieve maximum potential in gaining the ball. If doing a sliding tackle to the left, the player's left leg must be straight and their right leg should be bent slightly behind the left one.

'''''The Set-Up''''' is a 1949 American [[film noir]] boxing drama directed by [[Robert Wise]] and starring [[Robert Ryan]]&lt;ref name="hudson"&gt;[http://www.hudsonreview.com/su08/su08hunter.html Joseph Moncure March: Poem Noir Becomes Prizefight Film] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215051054/http://www.hudsonreview.com/su08/su08hunter.html |date=2012-12-15 }} from ''[[The Hudson Review]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Audrey Totter]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; March 23, 1949, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]'' film review; March 26, 1949, page 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  The screenplay was adapted by [[Art Cohn]] from a 1928 narrative poem written by [[Joseph Moncure March]]. ''The Set-Up'' was the last film Wise made for [[RKO]], and he named it his favorite among the pictures he directed for the studio, as well as one of his top ten during his entire career.&lt;ref name="dvd"&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Wise, Robert (Director) | date=6 July 2004 | title=Audio Commentary: The Set-Up | medium=Motion picture | publisher=Warner Studios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Bill "Stoker" Thompson ([[Robert Ryan]]) is a 35-year-old has-been boxer about to take on an opponent at the fictional Paradise City Arena. His wife, Julie ([[Audrey Totter]]), fears that this fight may be his last and wants him to forfeit the match. Tiny ([[George Tobias]]), Stoker's manager, is sure he will continue to lose fights, so he takes money for a "dive" from a mobster, but is so certain of Stoker's failure that he does not inform the boxer of the set-up.

The beginning of the film shows Stoker and Julie in their room at the Hotel Cozy, passionately debating whether he should participate in the fight. Julie tells him that she has a headache and won't attend the match. Stoker claims the $500 prize could allow them to buy a cigar stand or invest in another boxer, Tony Martinez, and start a new life. Julie says she cares more about his well-being than money, but Stoker responds: "If you're a fighter, you gotta fight."

After Stoker departs for the arena, Julie continues to struggle with her fear and desire to support him, but ultimately ends up not using her ticket to the event and instead roams the streets surrounding the arena.

At the beginning of the fourth and last round of the vicious match with the much younger and heavily favored Tiger Nelson ([[Hal Fieberling]]), Stoker learns about the fix. Even though he is told that Little Boy ([[Alan Baxter (actor)|Alan Baxter]]), a feared gangster, is behind the set-up, he refuses to give up the fight.

Stoker wins the vocal support of blood-thirsty fans who had at first rooted against him and ends up defeating his opponent. He pays for his decision with a beating in an alley outside the arena from Little Boy, Tiger Nelson, and their cronies. The group irreparably damages Stoker's hand with a smash from a brick.

The story closes with Julie meeting Stoker as he staggers out of the alley and collapses into her arms. "I won tonight," he tells her. "Yes," she answers. "You won tonight. We both won tonight."

==Background==
In 1947, almost two decades after March's poem was published, RKO paid him a little over $1,000 for the rights to the piece.&lt;ref name="hudson"/&gt;  Although March had nearly a decade of Hollywood writing credits during the 1930s (working on what a 2008 essay in ''[[The Hudson Review]]'' called "one forgotten and now unseeable film after another"), RKO did not ask him to adapt his own poem.&lt;ref name="hudson"/&gt;

The screen adaptation included a number of alterations to the original text.&lt;ref name="hudson"/&gt; The protagonist's name was changed from Pansy Jones to Stoker Thompson, his race was changed from black to white, he went from being a bigamist to being devotedly married, and his beating and subsequent death on a subway track was turned into an alley assault and a shattered hand. The opponent's name was changed from Sailor Gray to Tiger Nelson.

== Production ==

=== Casting ===
In an audio commentary accompanying the 2004 DVD release of the film, Robert Wise attributes the change in the protagonist's race to the fact that RKO had no African-American star actors under contract.&lt;ref name="dvd" /&gt; Although the film did have an African American actor (James Edwards) in a minor role as another boxer, Edwards was not a "star" under the then existing studio rules. March later commented in an ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' interview, saying:
:not only [did they throw] away the mainspring of the story, they evaded the whole basic issue of discrimination against the Negro.... Hollywood’s attitude to the Negro in films has been dictated all too often by box-office considerations: they are afraid of losing money in the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow South]].&lt;ref name="hudson"/&gt;

Robert Ryan, who was cast as Stoker Thompson, had boxing experience from his time at [[Dartmouth College]], where he was heavyweight champion for four years in a row.&lt;ref name="dvd" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burr|first1=Ty|title=The Actor Who Knew Too Much|url=http://dartmouthalumnimagazine.com/articles/actor-who-knew-too-much|website=Dartmouth Alumni Magazine|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wise and [[Sid Rogell]] had first thought of [[Joan Blondell]] to play Julie, following her performance as Zeena Krumbein in ''[[Nightmare Alley (film)|Nightmare Alley]]'', but RKO owner [[Howard Hughes]] refused, saying "Blondell looks like she was shot out of the wrong end of a cannon now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Matthew|title=Joan Blondell a life between takes|date=28 September 2009|publisher=University Press of Mississippiy|location=Jackson|isbn=9781604733006|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2flYpwKevy0C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filming ===
[[Dore Schary]], the uncredited executive producer who got the project going at RKO before his 1948 move to [[MGM]],&lt;ref name="hudson"/&gt; is credited with giving the film a [[Real time (media)|real time]] [[Narratology|narrative structure]], three years before the device was used in ''[[High Noon]]''.&lt;ref name="hudson"/&gt; Viewers are shown the passage of time throughout the film:
* 9:05 pm: The opening sequence features a clock in the town's square.
* 9:11 pm: An alarm clock wakes Stoker.
* 9:17 pm: Stoker leaves for the fight.
* 9:35 pm: Julie paces with indecision, takes her ticket to the event, and leaves their room. Stoker sees the lights go off from across the street and believes she will be at the match.
* 10:10 pm: Having returned to the room, Julie warms soup on the stove while Stoker is beaten in an alley across the street.
* 10:16 pm: The long shot of the clock and the town square returns for the closing sequence.

Prior to ''The Set-Up'', Richard Goldstone's production credits had been limited to a half-dozen ''[[Our Gang]]'' comedy shorts.&lt;ref name="hudson"/&gt;

The fight scene, which features an exchange of blows between Stoker and his opponent that is very close to the original poem,&lt;ref name="hudson"/&gt; was choreographed by former professional boxer [[Johnny Indrisano]].&lt;ref name="dvd" /&gt; Wise used three cameras to capture the action: one focused on the ring in its entirety; one on the fighters; and a third, hand-held device to catch details such as a glove connecting with a body.&lt;ref name="dvd" /&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
When the film was released ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewed the drama and lauded the picture's screenplay and the realistic depiction of the boxing ''[[Social environment|milieu]]''; they wrote:
:This RKO production...is a sizzling melodrama. The men who made it have nothing good to say about the sordid phase of the business under examination and their roving, revealing camera paints an even blacker picture of the type of fight fan who revels in sheer brutality. The sweaty, stale-smoke atmosphere of an ill-ventilated smalltime arena and the ringside types who work themselves into a savage frenzy have been put on the screen in harsh, realistic terms. And the great expectations and shattered hopes which are the drama of the dressing room also have been brought to vivid, throbbing life in the shrewd direction of Robert Wise and the understanding, colloquial dialogue written into the script by [[Art Cohn]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&amp;res=9F06E2DB133CE23BBC4850DFB5668382659EDE&amp;oref=slogin ''The New York Times'']. Film review of ''The Set-Up,'' March 30, 1949. Last accessed: December 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jefferson Hunter]], in a summer 2008 essay for ''[[The Hudson Review]]'', said:
:All through ''The Set-Up'', we see confirmed the oldest of truisms about film, that it tells its stories best in images, in what can be shown—a crowd’s blood lust, the boxers’ awareness of what’s coming to them in the end—as opposed to what is spoken or narrated.&lt;ref name="hudson"/&gt;

===Awards===
'''Wins'''
* [[1949 Cannes Film Festival]]: Best Cinematography, [[Milton R. Krasner]]; [[FIPRESCI]] Prize, Robert Wise; 1949.&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4157/year/1949.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Set-Up |accessdate=2009-01-11|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tim Coleman''' (dates unknown) was an early English [[cricket]]er who played for [[London Cricket Club]] and [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] during the 1720s and 1730s.

==Career==
Coleman is one of the earliest cricketers whose name has survived in contemporary records.  In 1731, a newspaper report of a match at [[Mitcham Cricket Green]] on Saturday 2 October  refers to him as "the famous Tim Coleman".&lt;ref name=DC&gt;[[H T Waghorn]], ''The Dawn of Cricket'', Electric Press, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

The full span of his career is unknown but he must have established his reputation during the 1720s when the London club is known to have played several matches.  London was the dominant team in English cricket through the 1730s.&lt;ref name=LL&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140105/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1731.html#coleman From Lads to Lord's – Tim Coleman]&lt;/ref&gt;
