'''Agents of Gaming''' was a [[game design]] [[studio]] that started out in January 1992 by Bruce Graw.  The company's original purpose was to run [[Galactic Conquest (play-by-mail game)|Galactic Conquest]], the [[play-by-mail game]] which became [[Star Fleet Warlord]]. Galactic Conquest had originally been run as a hobby (first created in late 1989), but proved its worth in the first eight games as a legitimate play-by-mail game. The public debut came at Gen Con/Origins 1992, followed shortly by a deal to make it an official Star Fleet Universe product (a change of the name to the Star Fleet Warlord).

[[Continental Conquest]] (then called Conquest of America) was written in 1992 and also started its first game at [[Gen Con/Origins]]. The European map was added in mid-1993 and the revision to the current rules (including the Oceania map) was completed in mid-1995.

The concept for [[Babylon 5 Wars]] was created by [[Robert N. Glass|Robert Glass]] in April 1996 and pitched to Agents of Gaming, and was nearly dismissed as an impossible prospect. Robert persisted, calling [[Warner Brothers]], and  was able to secure the license with the help of Agents of Gaming credentials. [[Kelly Lofgren]] was brought on board shortly thereafter. The basic game system took nearly a year to write, refine and playtest before it was finished in April 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19970702074746/http://www.agentsofgaming.com/bruce.htm Agents of Gaming Background]&lt;/ref&gt;

They also created several tabletop [[wargaming]] products before their closing on November 1, 2002. It collapsed shortly after Warner Brothers pulled their [[Babylon 5]] license, citing concerns that the license was not being grown. &lt;ref&gt;[http://worldsofjms.com/usenet/post/020929a.htm J. Michael Straczynski describing the collapse]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their notable games include:
* ''[[Babylon 5 Wars]]'' ([[Origins Award]] nominee)
* ''[[Babylon 5: Fleet Action]]''

The '''Australian Sport Awards''' originally called the Sport Australia Awards were established by the [[Confederation of Australian Sport]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Companion to Australian Sport|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne|pages=108–109|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1980 to 1996, the awards were limited to seven categories.
In 1993, there was a merger of the Sport Australia Awards and the [[ABC Sports Award of the Year]].&lt;ref name=merger&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inaugural ABC Sport Awards|journal=Sport Report|date=1993|volume=13|issue=4|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Bionic Commando'''|バイオニックコマンドー|Baionikkukomandō|lead=yes}} is a 2009 [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]], part of the ''[[Bionic Commando (arcade)|Bionic Commando]]'' series. The game was developed and published by Capcom in collaboration with Swedish developer [[Grin (company)|Grin]]. The game is a sequel to the 1988 NES game ''[[Bionic Commando (Nintendo Entertainment System)|Bionic Commando]]'', with certain storyline elements taken from its 2008 [[Video game remake|remake]] ''[[Bionic Commando Rearmed]]''. The game runs on Grin's own 'Diesel' engine.

==Gameplay==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
''Bionic Commando'' is an action-adventure game, in which the player controls player-character [[Rad Spencer|Nathan Spencer]]. The game uses several mechanics (primarily radiation) which act as barriers. These barriers are used to keep the players within the confines of the linear level design. Nathan Spencer is able to target enemies while hanging, climbing a building or even in mid-swing, while using an implement called the Bionic Arm which can also be used to [[Melee|attack enemies at close range]]. The bionic arm can be used to grab and launch objects such as boulders and cars at enemies.&lt;ref name="Bionic ref" /&gt; In addition, he is equipped with boots that enable him to survive extremely long falls. Spencer is equipped with Tungsten gun, which is shot quickly but does minimum damage to the enemies, and Prototype gun, which fires fast and does maximum damage.

==Synopsis==
[[Image:Bionic Commando Screen.jpg|thumb|left|The main character of the game, Nathan Spencer]]
The events of the game take place ten years after the original game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/previews/bionic-commando_6 |title=Bionic Commando (Preview) |last=Hayward |first=Andrew |date=October 19, 2007 |website=[[1UP.com]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307125155/http://www.1up.com/previews/bionic-commando_6 |archivedate=March 7, 2016 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game follows Major Nathan "RAD" Spencer ([[Voice acting|voiced]] by [[Faith No More]] singer [[Mike Patton]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://360.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=11531 |title=Faith No More's Mike Patton to Voice Bionic Commando |date=October 18, 2007}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; a government operative working in the fictional Ascension City and an Operative named Joseph Gibson aka "Super Joe" (voiced by [[Steven Blum]]) for the Tactical Arms and Security Committee (T.A.S.C) that trains bionic operatives like Spencer. After he is betrayed by his own government and falsely imprisoned, the Great Bionic Purge begins. Before his execution, an experimental weapon detonates in Ascension City, unleashing an earthquake along with a radioactive shock wave that leaves the city destroyed and wiping out its populace. The terrorist force known as the "BioReign" claims responsibility, threatening invasion.&lt;ref name="Bionic ref"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cheatcc.com/ccc_newsserver/Article.aspx?PostID=374174 |title=Capcom Revitalizes Bionic Commando |website=Cheat Code Central |date=October 16, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017000114/http://www.cheatcc.com/ccc_newsserver/Article.aspx?PostID=374174 |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spencer is freed to redeem his name along with the T.A.S.C's and is reunited with the bionic arm of which he was stripped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bioniccommando.com/en/pages/NG_Key_figures/id:1#content |title=Characters |website=Bionic Commando |publisher=[[Capcom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During flashbacks the player learns that two years prior Spencer and his bionic partner Lt. Jayne Magdalene failed to eliminate two rogue bionics who had allegedly murdered a handful of people. Spencer resolved to help the two bionics escape when he and his partner discovered that the FSA were actively rounding up and forcibly rehabilitating bionics; something that both Spencer and Magdalene were themselves. Soon after the two rogue bionics and a wounded Lt. Magdalene escaped, Spencer was arrested by the FSA and sentenced to be executed for his treason.

Returning to the present, Gibson releases Spencer on the condition that he assist the FSA against the threat to Ascension City. When given this ultimatum in exchange for his freedom, Spencer initially turns it down, but Gibson tells him he has knowledge of Spencer's missing wife. As Spencer progresses through Ascension City, he discovers information on Project Vulture, a super weapon being sought after by the terrorists. Spencer is ordered to retrieve the item before the Bio-Reign terrorists can. After finally gaining access to the item, he is betrayed by Joe who reveals himself as the leader of Bio-Reign. Joe has also enlisted the help of Gottfried Groeder, a character introduced in ''[[Bionic Commando Rearmed]]''.

Joe then reveals that Spencer's wife never left, and alludes to the concept that she is actually part of Spencer's bionic arm. According to Super Joe, in order for bionics to work perfectly, they have to sync with their host on both an emotional and physical level. In this case, Spencer's wife was the perfect candidate. After this revelation, Spencer hastens his pursuit after Joe who activates Project Vulture before Spencer reaches him. Magdalene tries to stall Super Joe, now in a Bio-Mech suit, but she is killed while Spencer is forced to helplessly watch. In a fierce mid-air battle, Spencer kills Joe and ultimately stops Project Vulture. He falls back into the hole of The Vault from which he, Joe and the vultures had ascended earlier.

In the epilogue a brief conversation in Morse code is shown between the sniper (Thomas Clarke) who'd been following Spencer, and an unknown party.  The first message reports that the Vault had been occupied and the Vulture Sentry System had been "disabled" before requesting further instructions.  While the coded reply was not decrypted from Morse code for the audience (encrypted message is in German once decrypted), it apparently reveals the following declaration in response: "Execution of Phase Two Prepared.  Activate Project Albatros [sic]."

==Development==
A [[comic book]] tie-in was written by [[Andy Diggle]], with [[Colin Wilson (comics)|Colin Wilson]] providing the art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bioniccommando.com/en/comics/ |title=Bionic Commando Comics |website=Bionic Commando |publisher=Capcom |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113104729/http://www.bioniccommando.com/en/comics/ |archivedate=January 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newsarama.com/465-diggle-bringing-bionic-commando-to-webcomics.html |title=Diggle: Bringing Bionic Commando to Webcomics |last=Kean |first=Benjamin Ong Pang |date=July 18, 2008 |website=[[Newsarama]] |accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the weeks leading up to the title's release, every Wednesday a new page was posted on the game's website. These single pages were collected in a thirty-five page comic, which was offered as a bonus for pre-ordering the title. After the game's release, a monthly comic was published by Devil's Due Publishing. [[Heather Mills]] was approached to help work on the game due to her work with amputees, but could not reach a compensation agreement with the developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/article2440331.ece |title=Greedy Mucca’s out of lucka |newspaper=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |publisher=[[News UK]] |date=May 21, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522103413/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/article2440331.ece |archivedate=May 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players can also use a code found in ''[[Bionic Commando: Rearmed]]'' to unlock a skin of "RAD" Spencer from the original game with short red hair, green blazer and converse like shoes. A similar unlock, the 'Prototype Weapon,' was also available via BCR.

Capcom's [[Keiji Inafune]] described the working relationship with Grin as "messed up", a situation which had arisen in previous instances of collaborations between Japanese and western developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/09/17/inafune-messed-up-working-relationship-led-to-bionic-commando/ |title=Inafune: 'Messed up' working relationship led to Bionic Commando's Wifearm |last=Gilbert |first=Ben |date=September 17, 2011 |website=[[Engadget]] ([[Joystiq]]) |publisher=[[Oath Inc.]] |accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto stated: "Our experience with Bionic Commando has demonstrated the difficulty of outsourcing the development of new title to overseas companies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/capcom-done-with-western-devs|title=Capcom done with Western devs|work=Eurogamer.net|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio===
The soundtrack for the game was generally well received. Kotaku described it as "suitably epic as well, with classic Bionic Commando music remixed into the sort of score you'd expect from a big-budget action flick."&lt;ref name="KotakuReview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/5271086/bionic-commando-review-grabbing-hands-grab-all-they-can |title=Bionic Commando - Grabbing Hands Grab All They Can |last=Fahey |first=Mike |date=May 27, 2009 |website=Kotaku |publisher=Gawker Media |accessdate=July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also available is the single rock and roll remix, "The Bionic Jam", created by artist [[vertexguy]] (Chris Kline). This appeared as a bonus track in the first mission, playing on a radio sitting on top a desk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sumthingdigital.com/AlbumDetails.aspx?albumid=3722 |title=The Bionic Jam |website=[[Sumthing Distribution]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809075816/http://www.sumthingdigital.com/AlbumDetails.aspx?albumid=3722 |archivedate=August 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limited edition==
Gamers who pre-ordered ''Bionic Commando'' from GameCrazy had a chance of winning a limited number of '80s-style metal lunchboxes.

In Australia, anyone who pre-ordered the game received a Nathan Spencer figure by [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|NECA]].

==Appearance in other media==
[[Nathan "Rad" Spencer|Spencer]] appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting games ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'', ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]'' and ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite]]'', sporting his look from the 2009 game. [[Dameon Clarke]] provided his voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/5659506/the-newest-marvel-vs-capcom-3-characters-are |title=The Newest Marvel Vs.

''Bionic Commando'' received "average" reviews on all platforms according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mcpc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mcps3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mcx360" /&gt; [[IGN]] praised the visuals and unpredictable storyline of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.&lt;ref name="ignreview" /&gt;  [[GameSpot]] said of both console versions, "''Bionic Commando'' has some enjoyable moments, but consistent fun always seems just out of arm's reach."&lt;ref name="gsreview" /&gt; In Japan, ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave both console versions a favorable review, giving each a score of 34 out of 40.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&amp;a=page_h_title&amp;title_id=5254|title=バイオニック コマンドー [PS3] / ファミ通.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&amp;a=page_h_title&amp;title_id=175|title=バイオニック コマンドー [Xbox 360] / ファミ通.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the PS3 version an A− and said, "As you squeeze off headshots and sail around the stunningly rendered destroyed city, the game's only hiccup is in forcing you to read fine-print-sized text about the game's optional mythology. But don't let a little reading stop you from enjoying what's essentially a playable action movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://games.avclub.com/bionic-commando-1798216578 |title=Bionic Commando (PS3) |last=Wolinsky |first=David |date=May 25, 2009 |website=[[The A.V.

As such, ''Bionic Commando'' at its best is a macho, cheeseball 80s action movie that Arnie or Sly would have been proud of."&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions three stars out of five and said that the game "looks good, but feels generally soulless and generic. Hardcore gamers will like the advanced difficulty level, but novices will find it infuriating. A damp squib of a revival."&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' gave the Xbox 360 version a score of six out of ten and said, "The overriding impression is of a game that's physically too big for its action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.edge-online.com/magazine/review-bionic-commando |title=Review: Bionic Commando (X360) |author=Edge staff |magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher=Future plc |issue=202 |date=June 2009 |page=88 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524010134/http://www.edge-online.com/magazine/review-bionic-commando |archivedate=May 24, 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' gave the Xbox 360 version a score of five stars out of ten, saying that its concepts "are strong, but the moment-to-moment action just doesn't deliver on the promise of how awesome it would be to have a grappling hook instead of a hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/05/review-bionic-commando/ |title=Review: Bionic Commando a Swing and a Miss (X360) |last=Kohler |first=Chris |date=May 18, 2009 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter HD''''' is a 2013 [[first-person shooter]] video game developed and published by Vogster Entertainment. It is the sixth game in the [[Carnivores (series)|''Carnivores'' series]] of dinosaur-hunting games, serving as a sequel as well as a modern remake of the original game, ''[[Carnivores (video game)|Carnivores]]'' (1998). The game was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] (PS3) via the [[PlayStation Network]] (PSN). ''Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter HD'' received "Mixed or average reviews" according to [[Metacritic]].

==Gameplay==
The game's premise is not told within the game itself. According to the [[PlayStation Network]] website, the player takes the role of a wealthy space-traveller in the future who hunts dinosaurs for sport on a distant planet similar to Earth.&lt;ref name=HCG/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt;

The game features three environments, including [[mesa]]s and forests, each with a daytime, dusk, and fog setting.&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt; The player is rewarded with gems and money after each hunt.&lt;ref name=OPM/&gt; The amount rewarded depends on how well the player did on the hunt. Gems and points are used respectively to purchase new weapons and unlock new environments.&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt;&lt;ref name=OPM/&gt; The player has access to a multi-purpose hunting device known as Gadget,&lt;ref name=OPM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blog2/&gt; which features a map, and informs whether the player is being watched by a dinosaur or making too much noise.&lt;ref name=PS/&gt; The device can be updated to include features such as radar, using gems earned from the hunts.&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt; The game does not feature any music, but includes dinosaur roars,&lt;ref name=PS/&gt; as well as the sounds of unseen birds, frogs, and insects.&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt;

Dinosaurs include ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'', ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'', ''[[Parasaurolophus]]'', ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', ''[[Triceratops]]'', and ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]''.&lt;ref name=Blog2/&gt; The player has the ability to evacuate a hunt at any time. Whenever the player is killed by a dinosaur, the screen fades to blackness rather than depicting a death scene. The player starts out hunting only herbivorous dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt; Killed dinosaurs are beamed up by the player's personal spaceship,&lt;ref name=OPM/&gt; and the player can purchase trophy versions of each killed dinosaur and display them in a trophy room.&lt;ref name=HCG/&gt; The game includes the "Observer Mode," which allows the player to explore a chosen environment and observe the dinosaurs rather than hunt them.&lt;ref name=Blog3/&gt; The player also has the option to tranquilize a dinosaur rather than kill it.&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt;

''Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter HD'' received "Mixed or average reviews" according to [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=MC&gt;{{cite web |title=Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter HD |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/carnivores-hd-dinosaur-hunter |website=Metacritic |accessdate=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewers particularly criticized the game for its [[Grinding (gaming)|grinding gameplay]].&lt;ref name=HCG/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt;&lt;ref name=OPM/&gt;&lt;ref name=PS/&gt;

David Meikleham of ''[[PlayStation Official Magazine – UK]]'' noted that the game had "a pretty out-there premise." Meikleham criticized the high amount of gems and points needed to purchase and unlock parts of the game, such as weapons and levels. However, he also wrote, "Slow-burning, often unspectacular, this PSN hunter nevertheless has a charming depth if you've got the patience to unearth it."&lt;ref name=OPM&gt;{{cite web |last=Meikleham |first=David |title=Carnivores HD: Dinosaur Hunter PS3 review – Tense lizard blaster goes bland before its time |url=http://www.officialplaystationmagazine.co.uk/review/carnivores-hd-dinosaur-hunter-ps3-review-tense-lizard-blaster-goes-bland-before-its-time/ |website= PlayStation Official Magazine – UK|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124232504/http://www.officialplaystationmagazine.co.uk/review/carnivores-hd-dinosaur-hunter-ps3-review-tense-lizard-blaster-goes-bland-before-its-time/ |archivedate=January 24, 2014 |date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Ramsey of ''[[Push Square]]'' praised the scenery, but noted the "cheap and tacky" design of the game's menus. Ramsey also criticized the repetitive dinosaur roars and the lack of music.&lt;ref name=PS&gt;{{cite web |last=Ramsey|first=Robert |title=Review: Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter HD (PlayStation 3) |url=http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/psn/carnivores_dinosaur_hunter_hd |website=Push Square |accessdate=June 27, 2018 |date=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kallie Plagge of [[IGN]] called the game "slow, aimless, bland, and not nearly as exciting as the name would have us believe." Plagge stated that despite the "''HD''" in its title, the game had "some truly awful" and outdated textures. Plagge praised the environmental exploration as the highlight of the game, but was critical of the rewards system. Plagge also criticized the ability to evacuate a hunt, stating that "removing any sense of danger or risk takes a lot of the fun out of playing." Additionally, Plagge criticized the lack of player death scenes, and stated that the game "fails to deliver in almost every way."&lt;ref name=IGN&gt;{{cite web |last=Plagge |first=Kallie |title=Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter HD Review |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/27/carnivores-dinosaur-hunter-hd-review |website=IGN |accessdate=June 27, 2018 |date=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee Cooper of ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'' praised the controls but criticized some of the graphics as being "poorly rendered," and stated that while "the dinosaurs look pretty cool, and the environments are expansive and littered with detail, the game is simply not fun." Cooper also criticized the lack of an in-game storyline, but concluded that the game was the "best arcade-style dinosaur hunting game" available for the PS3.&lt;ref name=HCG&gt;{{cite web |last=Cooper |first=Lee |title=Review: Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter HD |url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2013/09/22/review-carnivores-dinosaur-hunter-hd/55563/ |website=Hardcore Gamer |accessdate=June 27, 2018 |date=September 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2703">The '''''Cinebox''''' was a coin-operated Italian 16mm [[Movie projector|film projector]] [[juke box]] type machine invented in 1959 that appeared in Europe to rival the French made [[Scopitone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scopitonearchive.com/cinebox/index.html |title=Cinebox/Colorama/Cinejukebox |publisher=Scopitone Archive |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that appeared in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michelebovi.it/?p=1965&amp;lang=en |title=Michele BoviThe Spy-Story of Music Videos * Michele Bovi |publisher=Michelebovi.it |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cinebox was manufactured in Rome by [[Ottico Meccanica Italiana]].

In 1963 it appeared in the USA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lPYGAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=cinebox&amp;dq=cinebox&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2QVnTbH3GoqKvQOMy-XjAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwADgK |title=Newsweek - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was retitled '''''Colorama''''' in 1965.  In 1961 Cinebox machines were placed on [[ocean liner]]s of the [[American Export Lines]] with Cineboxes showing cartoons and [[short subject]] comedies in on board nurseries whilst on board lounges showed musical and [[Travel documentary|travelogues]].  Each of the Cineboxes held five 40 minute films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=%22the+three+stooges+go+around+the+world+on+eighty+cents%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GQJnTbuwHIG3cKmY3Y0M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Billboard - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.au |date=1961-09-25 |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States the Cinebox musical juke box provided three minutes of sound film for 25 cents with 40 titles available at a time on the machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=niADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=cinebox&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qwJnTYiHBIn0vQPG3OHjAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=cinebox&amp;f=false |title=Popular Science - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the Cinebox became the first e.commerce website (cinebox.net), founded by Loïc Berthout, to sell movies (DVD) online in 1998. It then proposed video games and reached an international scope. It was also selling through cinebox.com until 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27199">{{Main article|Characteristics of Harold Pinter's work#"Comedy of menace"}}
'''Comedy of menace''' is the body of plays written by [[David Campton]], [[Nigel Dennis]], [[N. F. Simpson]], and [[Harold Pinter]].  The term was coined by drama critic [[Irving Wardle]], who borrowed it from the subtitle of Campton's play ''[[The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace]]'', in reviewing Pinter's and Campton's plays in ''[[Encore (magazine)|Encore]]'' in 1958.  (Campton's subtitle ''Comedy of Menace'' is a jocular play-on-words derived from ''[[comedy of manners]]''—''menace'' being ''manners'' pronounced with somewhat of a Judeo-English accent.)&lt;ref name=Merritt&gt;See Merritt 5, 9–10, 225–28, 240, 310, and 326, citing articles by Wardle, Gussow's ''Conversations with Pinter'', and various performance reviews by Wardle, Gussow, and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Citing Wardle's original publications in ''Encore'' magazine (1958), Susan Hollis Merritt points out that in "Comedy of Menace" Wardle "first applies this label to Pinter's work … describ[ing] Pinter as one of 'several playwrights who have been tentatively lumped together as the "non-naturalists" or "abstractionists"&amp;nbsp;' (28)" (Merritt 225).  His article "Comedy of Menace," Merritt continues,
&lt;blockquote&gt;centers on ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' because it is the only play of Pinter's that Wardle had seen [and reviewed] at the time, yet he speculates on the basis of "descriptions of [Pinter's] other plays, '[[The Room (play)|The Room]]' and '[[The Dumb Waiter]]', [that Pinter] is a writer dogged by one image—the womb" (33).  Mentioning the acknowledged "literary influences" on Pinter's work—"Beckett, Kafka and American gangster films"—Wardle argues that "&amp;nbsp;'The Birthday Party' exemplifies the type of comic menace which gave rise to this article." (225)&lt;ref&gt;[[Cf.]] Billington 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "Comedy of Menace", as Merritt observes, on the basis of his experience of ''The Birthday Party'' and others' accounts of the other two plays, Wardle proposes that "Comedy enables the committed agents and victims of destruction to come on and off duty; to joke about the situation while oiling a revolver; to display absurd or endearing features behind their masks of implacable resolution; to meet … in paper hats for a game of blind man's buff"; he suggests how "menace" in Pinter's plays "stands for something more substantial: destiny," and that destiny, "handled in this way—not as an austere exercise in classicism, but as an incurable disease which one forgets about most of the time and whose lethal reminders may take the form of a joke—is an apt dramatic motif for an age of conditioned behaviour in which orthodox man is a willing collaborator in his own destruction" (Wardle, "Comedy of Menace" 33; rpt. in ''The Encore Reader'' 91).

"Just two years later" (1960), however, Wardle retracted "Comedy of Menace" in his review of ''[[The Caretaker]]'', stating: "On the strength of 'The Birthday Party' and the pair of one-acters, I rashly applied the phrase 'comedy of menace' to Pinter's writing.  I now take it back" ("There's Music" 130, as qtd. in Merritt 225–26).

After Wardle's retraction of ''comedy of menace'' as he had applied it to Pinter's writing, Pinter himself also occasionally disavowed it and questioned its relevance to his work (as he  also did with his own offhand but apt statement that his plays are about "the weasel under the cocktail cabinet").  For example, in December 1971, in his interview with Pinter about ''[[Old Times]]'', [[Mel Gussow]] recalled that "After ''[[The Homecoming]]'' [Pinter] said that [he] 'couldn't any longer stay in the room with this bunch of people who opened doors and came in and went out.  ''[[Landscape]]'' and ''[[Silence]]'' [the two short poetic memory plays that were written between ''The Homecoming'' and ''Old Times''] are in a very different form.  There isn't any menace at all.'&amp;nbsp;"  Later, when Gussow asked Pinter to expand on his view that he had "tired" of "menace", Pinter added: "when I said that I was tired of menace, I was using a word that I didn't coin.  I never thought of menace myself.  It was called 'comedy of menace' quite a long time ago [1958].  I never stuck categories on myself, or on any of us [playwrights].  But if what I understand the word menace to mean is certain elements that I have employed in the past in the shape of a particular play, then I don't think it's worthy of much more exploration" (Gussow, ''Conversations with Pinter'' 18, 24).

Despite Wardle's retraction of ''comedy of menace'' (and Pinter's later qualifications), ''Comedy of menace'' and ''comedies of menace'' caught on and have been prevalent since the late 1950s in advertisements and in critical accounts, notices, and reviews to describe Pinter's early plays and some of his later work as well.&lt;ref name=Merritt/&gt;  As Merritt points out, among other examples of critics' usage of this and similar categories of Pinter's work, after Gussow's 1971 "conversation" with Pinter, "Though he echoes Wardle's concept, Gussow seems to avoid using ''comedy of menace'' when reviewing the CSC Repertory Theatre's 1988 production of ''The Birthday Party''.  While still emphasizing Pinter's 'terrors' and the 'shiver beneath the laughter,' Gussow describes the play as 'a play of intrigue, with an underlying motif of betrayal' … [and] [Bernard F.] Dukore calls the play 'a comedy (of menace or otherwise)' … (Merritt 10).

==Selected examples from Pinter's plays and sketches==
&lt;!--See Wikified links to articles on the plays for further details and interpretations of their elements of comedy and menace and critical references.--&gt;
;''The Birthday Party'' (1958)

In discussing the first production of Pinter's first full-length play, ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' (1958), which followed his first play, ''[[The Room (play)|The Room]]'' (1957), his authorised official biographer [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] points out that Wardle "once excellently" described its setting (paraphrasing Wardle), as "a banal living-room [which] opens up to the horrors of modern history" (Billington 86).

;''The Dumb Waiter'' (1960)

In his second one-act play, ''[[The Dumb Waiter]]'' (1960), as accentuated through the 2008 film by [[Martin McDonagh]] closely resembling and markedly influenced by it, ''[[In Bruges]]'', "Pinter conveys the idea of political terror through the staccato rhythms of [[music hall|music-hall]] cross-talk and the urban thriller: [[Hackney Empire]] cross-fertilises with [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Killers (Hemingway short story)|The Killers]]'' [1927]" (Billington 90), one of Pinter's own acknowledged early influences, along with [[Franz Kafka]] (348–49); Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists, such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Webster]], and [[Cyril Tourneur]], whose work his schoolmaster Joseph Brearley had introduced to him; [[Samuel Beckett]] (mostly his novels [43]); and black-and-white American movies of the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=WardleinMerritt&gt;See Wardle, "Comedy of Menace" 33, as qtd. in Merritt 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

"A near-perfect play about the testiness of a collapsing partnership and the divide-and-rule tactics of authority," according to Billington, ''The Dumb Waiter'' focuses on two characters, Gus and Ben; Gus is "the man who questions the agreed system and who is ultimately destroyed by his quest for meaning"; Ben, "the man who blindly obeys orders and thereby places himself at risk.  (If the system can arbitrarily dispose of his partner, why not of him?)" (92).  As Pinter's ''The Dumb Waiter'' has been categorised as a "comedy of menace," so may be  McDonagh's ''In Bruges'', as it closely resembles it; yet, despite the comedy and the sense of threat growing out of the menace, these works of Pinter and McDonagh are, in Pinter's words to Billington, also "doing something which can be described as political" (92).  At the same time, [Pinter] had – and still [in 1996 through to the time of his death in 2008] has – an acute sense of the fragility of earthly happiness and of the terrors that haunt us even from infancy" (92).

The "punning title" of ''The Dumb Waiter'', Billington observes, "carries several layers of meaning": "It obviously refers to the antique serving-hatch that despatches [sic] ever more grotesque orders for food to these bickering gunmen"—the [[dumbwaiter (elevator)|dumbwaiter]]; "But it also applies to Gus, who, troubled by the nature of the mission [their next job as hitmen] to realise he is its chosen target; or, indeed to Ben, who, by his total obedience to a higher authority that forces him to eliminate his partner, exposes his own vulnerability" (89).  As Gus "dumbly" awaits his fate, he may be a subservient partner who awaits orders from the "senior partner" Ben, but Ben too is subservient to [[The powers that be (phrase)|The Powers That Be]], a contemporary variation on [[Deus ex machina]], manipulating both the mechanical dumbwaiter and them through its increasingly extravagant and thus comically inconvenient "orders" for increasingly exotic dishes, unnerving both of them.

Billington adds:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This being Pinter, the play has a metaphorical openness.  You can interpret it as an [[Theatre of the absurd|Absurdist comedy]] – a kind of ''[[Waiting for Godot|Godot]]'' in [[Birmingham]] – about two men passing the time in a universe without meaning or purpose.  You can see it as a cry of protest against a whimsically cruel God who treats man as His plaything – even the twelve matches that are mysteriously pushed under the door have been invested with religious significance [by critics].  But it makes much more sense if seen as a play about the dynamics of power and the nature of partnership.  Ben and Gus are both victims of some unseen authority ''and'' a surrogate married couple quarrelling, testing, [[talking past each other]] and raking over old times. (90)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The comedy in this "comedy of menace" often derives from such arguments between Gus and Ben, especially the one that occurs when "Ben tells Gus to go and light the kettle," a "semantic nit-picking that is a standard part of music-hall comedy": "All the great stage and film double acts – [[Jimmy Jewel|Jewel]] and [[Ben Warriss|Warriss]], [[Abbott and Costello]] – fall into this kind of verbal worrying in which the bullying 'male' straight man issues instructions which are questioned by the more literal-minded 'female' partner" —
&lt;blockquote&gt;
GUS: Light what?&lt;br&gt;
BEN: The kettle.&lt;br&gt;
GUS: You mean the gas.&lt;br&gt;
BEN: Who does?&lt;br&gt;
GUS: You do.&lt;br&gt;
BEN: (''his eyes narrowing''): What do you mean, I mean the gas?&lt;br&gt;
GUS: Well, that's what you mean, don't you? The gas.&lt;br&gt;
BEN: (''Powerfully''): If I say go and light the kettle I mean go and light the kettle.&lt;br&gt;
GUS: How can you light a kettle?&lt;br&gt;
BEN: It's a figure of speech! Light the kettle.  It's a figure of speech! (Qtd. in Billington 90–91)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Billington observes further,
&lt;blockquote&gt;This kind of comic pedantry has precise echoes of the great [[Sid Field]] – ironically [since the city is the setting of this play] a Birmingham comic – who had a famous sketch in which he played a virgin of the greens being hectored by [[Jerry Desmonde]]'s golf pro who would cry, in exasperation, 'When I say "Slowly Back" I don't mean "Slowly Back", I mean "Slowly Back."&amp;nbsp;' At another moment, the bullying pro would tell the hapless Sid to get behind the ball and he would vainly protest 'But it's behind all round it'. But, where in a music-hall sketch this kind of semantic by-play was its own justification, in Pinter it becomes a crucial part of the power-structure.  … The pay-off comes when Gus, having dogmatically insisted that the accurate phrase is 'put on the kettle', suddenly finds an irritated Ben adopting the right usage. (91)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Everything" in ''The Dumb Waiter'', Billington observes, "contributes towards a necessary end"; for, "the image, as Pete says in [Pinter's only novel] ''[[The Dwarfs (novel)|The Dwarfs]]'', stands in exact correspondence and relation to the idea" (91).  In this example, the central image and central metaphor, the dumbwaiter, while "despatching ever more unlikely orders," serves as "both a visual gag and a metaphor for manipulative authority" (91), and therein lies its menace.  When Ben instructs Gus verbally, while practicing their "routine" for killing their next victim, he leaves out the most important line, which instructs Gus to "take out" his "gun" (Pinter, ''The Dumb Waiter'' 114–15):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"BEN ''frowns and presses his forehead''.&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  You've missed something out.&lt;br&gt;
BEN.  I know.  What?&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  I haven't taken my gun out, according to you.&lt;br&gt;
BEN.  You take your gun out—&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  After I've closed the door.&lt;br&gt;
BEN.  After you've closed the door.&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  You've never missed that out before, you know that?&lt;br&gt;
(Pinter, ''The Dumb Waiter'' 116)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The crucial significance of the omission becomes clear only at the very end of the play, when "Gus enters through the door stage-right – the one marked for the intended victim – stripped of his gun and holster"; it becomes clear that ''he'' is going to be "Ben's target" (Billington 92), as Ben's "''revolver [is] levelled at the door''", though the play ends ''before'' Ben fires any shot (Pinter, ''The Dumb Waiter'' 121).

;''The Caretaker'' (1960)

In an entry on Pinter for the 1969 edition of ''[[The Encyclopedia of World Drama]]'' cited by Merritt, Wardle repeats and updates some of his first perspective on ''comedy of menace'' as he had applied it initially to Pinter's writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Early in his writing career Pinter admitted to three influences: [[Franz Kafka]], American gangster films, and [[Samuel Beckett]]. . . . At that time his plays, more than those of any other plawright's {{sic}}, were responsible for the newly coined term 'comedy of menace.'  This phrase certainly makes sense when applied to ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' . . . or to ''[[The Dumb Waiter]]''. . . . But 'menace' is hardly the word for ''[[The Caretaker]]'', and still less for subsequent plays in which Pinter increasingly exchanged his derelict settings and down-and-out characters for environments of moneyed elegance (657–58).  (Qtd. in Merritt 240)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite those more-recent caveats regarding applying the phrase that he himself initially coined for Pinter's writing to ''The Caretaker''—only the second of Pinter's full-length plays produced by then and the one that launched his career as a successful playwright in 1960 (Merritt 9, 226) —and to Pinter's later plays, scenes in both acts of ''The Caretaker'' in which Mick confronts an unsuspecting Davies and scares him almost speechless (Pinter, ''The Caretaker'' 129, 146) also epitomise how comedy and menace still co-exist in Pinter's text and on Pinter's stage.

The comic aspects of this play multiply, reaching a crescendo in Mick's monologue in Act Two describing his "deepest wishes" for decorating the attic room (161, 173) and falling with Davies, a tramp taken in out of the cold by his brother, suggesting that "if" he can "just get down to Sidcup" to get his "papers" and "sort" himself "out" (113–16, 164), his refrain and excuse for everything (153, 175–79), he might just be able to accomplish Mick's hyperbolic pipe dream and "decorate the attic room out for [Mick]" (164), leading Mick to accuse Davies of misrepresenting himself as "an experienced first-class professional interior and exterior decorator" (172–74), an absurd conclusion, given the tangible evidence of the down-and-out Davies before Mick (and the audience).

Pinter's friend the late film and stage director [[David Jones (director)|David Jones]], who directed the play for the [[Roundabout Theatre]], in [[New York City]], in 2003 (having previously directed Pinter's 1983 film of ''[[Betrayal (1983 film)|Betrayal]]'', as well as other works by or featuring him), reminds his audience that Pinter himself said, in a widely quoted statement, that ''The Caretaker'' is only "funny, up to a point" and that "beyond that point" is why he wrote it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is always mischief lurking in the darkest corners. The world of The Caretaker is a bleak one, its characters damaged and lonely. But they are all going to survive. And in their dance to that end they show a frenetic vitality and a wry sense of the ridiculous that balance heartache and laughter. Funny, but not too funny. As Pinter wrote, back in 1960: "As far as I am concerned The Caretaker IS funny, up to a point. Beyond that point, it ceases to be funny, and it is because of that point that I wrote it." (Jones)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Beyond the point" of the comedy (the "funny") lies the scary territory that threatens one's very existence (Billington 92), which Wardle and others commonly have "labeled" or "pigeonholed" (depending on one's perspective) as "menace" (Merritt 9–10).

;Pinter's later plays

Though "comedy of menace" is generally applied to Pinter's early work of the late 1950s through the middle of the 1960s, including ''[[The Collection (play)|The Collection]]'' (1961), ''[[The Lover (play)|The Lover]]'' (1963), ''[[Tea Party (play)|Tea Party]]'' (1965, 1968), and ''[[The Homecoming]]'' (1965), even Pinter's late plays, like ''[[Ashes to Ashes (play)|Ashes to Ashes]]'' (1996) and ''[[Celebration (play)|Celebration]]'' (2000), his last two full-length stage plays, exhibit his characteristic amalgam of the comic and the menacing, a sense of threat or impending doom; there is less comedy and more menace in ''Ashes to Ashes'', in which heavy echoes of the [[Holocaust]] predominate; a more comedy than menace in ''Celebration'', where heightened comic dialogue outweighs the frightening undercurrents of terror, the terrifying, or the terrible.

;''Celebration'' (2000)

While reviewers and other audience members describe ''[[Celebration (play)|Celebration]]'' as hilarious ("one of Pinter's funniest plays", according to Billington [404]), the nature of the relationships of two sets of diners (three couples) having dinner in an upscale restaurant (which some critics assume that Pinter modeled on [[The Ivy]], in London's [[West End (London)|West End]]) – "this is the best and most expensive restaurant in the whole of Europe" (Pinter, ''Celebration'' 364) – remains characteristically ambiguous; Billington describes one set of couples as "a strangely rootless bunch with a depleted sense of family" (405).

One set (the two couples seated at Table One) consists of brothers Lambert and Matt and their wives, Prue and Julie, who are sisters; the second set of diners (the couple seated at Table Two) consists of a banker and his young wife, Suki, who comically turns out to have had an affair with Lambert when she was 18 (Billington 104).

As the "''maître d'hôtel''" emits platitudes geared to elevate the nouveaux riches in their own imagined esteem ("I believe the concept of this restaurant rests in that [[public house]] of my childhood" [Pinter, ''Celebration'' 371]), the "''maîtress d'hôtel''" appears to dwell on a peculiar past family and sex life (373–74), while the Waiter engages in "interjections" spinning fantasied impossible memories of a grandfather who knew writers, other artists, and various other public figures of multiple decades and geographical locations too far apart to have been experienced personally in one man's lifetime (367, 375).

Lambert and Matt reveal themselves to be rather uncouth bullies ("[[Teddy boys]]", according to some London reviews)—
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Lambert's [[mobile phone]] rings''.&lt;br&gt;
LAMBERT  Who the fuck's this?&lt;br&gt;
''He switches it on''.&lt;br&gt;
LAMBERT (''cont''.)  Yes? What? (''He listens briefly''.)  I said no calls! It's my fucking wedding anniversary!&lt;br&gt;
''He switches it off''.&lt;br&gt;
LAMBERT (''cont''.) Cunt.&lt;br&gt;  (Pinter, ''Celebration'' 364)—&lt;/blockquote&gt;
who describe themselves as "consultants … Strategy consultants. … It means we don't carry guns.  … We don't have to! … We're peaceful strategy consultants. … Worldwide.  Keeping the peace (379). ''Strategy consultant'' could be a [[euphemism|euphemistic]] catchall for  warmonger, manager of [[terrorism]], purveyor of [[counter-terrorism]], or orderer of [[covert operations]].

As the banker Russell interprets their explanation, ''peaceful strategy consultants'' seems vaguely menacing: "We need more people like you.  Taking responsibility.  Taking charge.  Keeping the peace.  Enforcing the peace.  Enforcing peace.  We need more like you" (379).  This speech stressing "force" (in the repetitions of ''Enforcing'') occurs after Russell has already revealed his own ilk:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Look at me.  I'm basically a totally disordered personality; some people would describe me as a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]].  (''to Suki'') Am I right?&lt;br&gt;
SUKI  Yes.&lt;br&gt;
RUSSELL  But when I'm sitting in this restaurant I suddenly find I have no psychopathic tendencies at all.  I don't feel like killing everyone in sight, I don't feel like putting a bomb under everyone's arse.  I feel something quite different, I have a sense of equilibrium, of harmony, I love my fellow diners.  Now this is very unusual for me.  Normally I feel—as I've just said—absoute malice and hatred towards everyone within spitting distance—but here I feel love. How do you explain it?&lt;br&gt;
SUKI  It's the ambience. (370–71)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lambert and Matt are distantly reminiscent of Gus and Ben from ''The Dumb Waiter''; but distinctly less polite while living much higher on the hog.  One imagines such characters 
"strategically" plotting the "peaceful" rendition of others without any qualms while sipping [[Perrier]] and simultaneously planning their next wedding-anniversary dinner celebration (perhaps with a different set of wives) on their [[Mobile phone|mobiles]].

As the Waiter says in his apparently penultimate "interjection", in which one might detect intimations of mortality:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My grandfather introduced me to the mystery of life and I'm still in the middle of it.  I can't find the door to get out.  My grandfather got out of it.  He left it behind him and he didn't look back.&lt;br&gt;
He got that absolutely right.&lt;br&gt;
And I'd like to make one further interjection.&lt;br&gt;
''He stands still''.&lt;br /&gt;
''Slow fade''.&lt;br&gt;
(385)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;"Apart From That" (Sketch) (2006)

Pinter mocks [[mobile phone]]s comically in an ostensibly-trivial wireless conversation, while still suggesting a residual bit of menace in the unsaid, developed as his last revue sketch ''[[Apart From That (sketch)|Apart From That]]'' (2006).  As Billington observes, this dramatic sketch inspired by Pinter's strong aversion to mobile phones is "very funny", but "as two people trade banalities over their mobile phones[,] there is a hint of something ominous and unspoken behind the clichéd chat" (429), as illustrated in the following excerpt:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Two people on mobile phones''.&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
How are you?&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
Very well.  And you? Are you well?&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;

'''Dance se Puder''' (''Dance If You Can'') is a [[talent show]] produced in [[Brazil]] and aired as a segment of the [[Sunday]] program "Eliana", on [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão|SBT]] network. During the competition, a number of young artists known to the public compete to find out who is the best dancer. It is hosted by [[Eliana Michaelichin Bezerra|Eliana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diariosp.com.br/blog/detalhe/32619/eliana-acerta-com-dance-se-puder-no-sbt|title=Eliana acerta com "Dance Se Puder" no SBT|author=Roberto Rodrigues|date=11 April 2016|publisher=[[Diário de S. Paulo]]|access-date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each participant has to dance to a song chosen by the producers and they have a week to learn the choreography. On stage, they are judged by Jaime Arôxa, Ivan Santos and the new judge Li Martins. The winner will earn R$50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbt.com.br/eliana/fiquepordentro/74618/Dance-Se-Puder-Carrossel-e-Chiquititas-quebram-tudo-em-quadro-de-danca.html|title=Dance Se Puder: Carrossel e Chiquititas quebram tudo em quadro de dança|author=|date=28 March 2016|publisher=[[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão|SBT]]|access-date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Demala diviyan keliya''' or '''Koti Sellama''' is a two-player [[abstract strategy]] [[board game]] from [[Sri Lanka]], formerly known as [[Ceylon]].&lt;ref name = "ParkerDemalaDiviyanKeliya"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60I65HkGFg4C&amp;pg=PA682&amp;lpg=PA682&amp;dq=Hat+diviyan+keliya&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DwO94oJlL7&amp;sig=uJtImaFQKFV7z-zdKVeoT2D5248&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC_fXvg43UAhVjsVQKHajtDZw4ChDoAQgvMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Hat%20diviyan%20keliya&amp;f=false|title=Ancient Ceylon: An Account of the Aborigines and of Part of the Early Civilisation|last=Parker|first=Henry|publisher=Luzac &amp; Co.|year=1909|location=London|pages=581}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a hunt game, and since it uses a triangle board, Demala diviyan keliya is specifically a [[leopard]] hunt game (or leopard game).  Three [[leopard]]s are going up against fifteen dogs.  The dogs attempt to surround and trap the leopards while the leopards attempt to capture enough of them in order to foil their objective.  It is unknown how old the game is, but the game was described by [[Henry Parker (author)|H. Parker]] in his 1909 book ''Ancient [[Ceylon]]:  An Account of the [[Australian Aborigines|Aborigines]] and of Part of the Early Civilisation''.&lt;ref name="ParkerDemalaDiviyanKeliya" /&gt;  The game is also known as '''the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] leopards' game'''.  The game is well known in Southern [[India]], and its Hindustani name is '''Rafāya'''.&lt;ref name="ParkerDemalaDiviyanKeliya" /&gt;

== Setup ==
The board consist of an isosceles triangle where two additional line segments run from the apex of the triangle down to its base thus dividing the triangle into four triangular compartments.  In addition, a rectangle intersects the triangle breadth-wise.  The rectangle itself is divided into two rectangles as a line segment runs across its breadth.  This makes a board with 21 intersection points (hereforth called "points").  There are fifteen dog pieces and three leopard pieces.  The dog pieces should be distinguishable from the leopard pieces.  

Players decide who will play the Leopards and who will play the Dogs.  

Henry Parker does not describe if the board is empty in the beginning or if the three leopard pieces are entered one piece at a time or if all three are already placed on the board and exactly how and where they are placed.  Parker only states that the game is played in the same way as in [[Hat diviyan keliya]] which is also a leopard game played in Sri Lanka but with less pieces and points on the board.  &lt;ref group="note"&gt;In Hat Diviyan Keliya, the single tiger piece is comparable to the three leopard pieces in Demala diviyan keliya as they are the side that can perform captures, and the single tiger piece is placed on the apex of the triangle board.&lt;/ref&gt;  The fifteen dog pieces are set beside the board.

== Rules ==

*Players alternate their turns throughout the game.  

*The Dogs on its turn may drop one of its pieces onto any vacant point on the board, and only one in a turn.  All fifteen dog pieces must be dropped first before any of them may be moved.    

*Assuming all three leopard pieces are already on the board, the Leopards on its turn may either move one of its pieces onto a vacant adjacent point following the pattern on the board, or capture a dog piece by the short leap.  In capturing a dog by the short leap, the leopard must be adjacent to the dog, and leap over it (in a straight line and following the pattern of the board) landing on a vacant point immediately beyond.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Henry Parker writes "Capturing the Dogs is termed 'chopping' them (''v. kotanawā'')"&lt;/ref&gt;  The captured dog piece is removed from the board.  Only one capture is allowed in a turn.  Captures are not compulsory.

*After all the dog pieces have been dropped, the Dogs may move one of its pieces onto a vacant point following the pattern on the board.  Unlike the Leopards, the Dogs cannot perform a capture.  

*The Dogs win if they surround and trap the three leopards.  That is, the Leopards cannot move or capture on their turn.  The Leopards win if they capture enough dogs making it impossible for them to be trapped.

The '''Dickinson classification''' is a [[library classification]] scheme used to catalogue and classify [[musical composition]]s. It was developed by George Sherman Dickinson (1886–1964), and is used by many music libraries, primarily those at [[University at Buffalo]], [[Vassar College|Vassar]], and [[Columbia University|Columbia]] Universities.

It is fully detailed by [[Carol June Bradley]] in ''The Dickinson classification : a cataloguing &amp; classification manual for music''; including a reprint of the ''[[George Sherman Dickinson]] Classification of Musical Compositions'' published by Carlisle Books (1968).

[[File:Fernseh-Einheitsempfänger_E1.jpg|thumb|right|TV receiver E1 (1939)]]

In August 1939, [[Nazi Germany]] introduced the ''Einheits-Fernseh-Empfänger E1'' (i.e. ''Unitary-TV-receiver E1''), also called ''Volksfernseher'' (i.e. ''People's TV''), a [[441-line television system|441-line]], 50 interlaced [[frames per second]] [[television]] system. The TV was presented to the public in the 16th [[Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin|International radio exhibition Berlin]].

The project started in 1938, associating the [[Reichspost]] and several companies, including [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], [[Blaupunkt]],  [[Loewe AG|Loewe]], Lorenz, TeKaDe and [[Telefunken]]. The objective was to produce 10,000 units, but the start of [[World War II]] caused only about 50 devices to be installed in military hospitals and various government departments. The [[Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow|Berlin]] transmitter was destroyed by Allied bombing in November 1943.

Like British televisions of the era, the '''Einheitsempfänger''' could receive only one channel with its [[frequency]] pre-tuned at the factory to reduce construction costs.

Only a few surviving and functioning units are known:
* Museum for Communication Berlin (Telefunken)
* Museum for Communication Berlin (Blaupunkt, incomplete)
* [[Museum für Kommunikation Frankfurt|Museum of Communication in Frankfurt]] (Telefunken, with a new speaker, otherwise completely preserved)
* Private collection of August-Peter Nehrig (Telefunken, completely preserved)
* [[German Museum of Technology]], Berlin (reproduction without original chassis and a new speaker fabric)
* [[Hochschule Mittweida|University of Mittweida]] (Blaupunkt, with a new speaker material, condition unknown)
* Fuerth Radio Museum (original chassis with power transformer in the exhibition)
* Fuerth Radio Museum (functional, for demonstration)

==Technical data for a typical set==
* Case dimensions (W×H×D): 65&amp;nbsp;cm × 37&amp;nbsp;cm × 38&amp;nbsp;cm
* Image size: 19.5&amp;nbsp;cm × 22.5&amp;nbsp;cm, 29&amp;nbsp;cm diagonal; aspect ratio 15:13 (approx 3.46:3)
* Power consumption: 185 W in television reception mode, 60 W in radio reception mode

'''Fishcam''' refers to a [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] consisting of a [[video camera]] pointed at a [[fish tank]].

== Australia ==
[[Channel 31 Melbourne]], [[Australia]], had one of the more famous and long-lasting Fishcams. The Fishcam itself was originally used as a replacement to the more common [[testcards]], shown when the station had nothing else to air. Due to extreme popularity though, the [[Melbourne|''FishCam'']] became an actual scheduled show on the network. The station has also released several [[VHS]] tapes of the program. The broadcast was accompanied by the music of unsigned Melbourne musicians.

Rumours have abounded amongst fans that Channel 31 has played repeats of this program while it has continued to be labelled "live".
  
From 4 March 2007 the broadcasting of ''FishCam'' on Channel 31 has ceased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c31.org.au/shows/fishcam.php Channel 31 Fishcam show guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407024526/http://www.c31.org.au/shows/fishcam.php |date=2008-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 2014 ''FishCam'' returned at the new time of 9 pm hosted by Luis from Lessons with Luis. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2014/10/fishcam-returns-to-channel-31.html&lt;/ref&gt; It ran for 11 episodes, ending on December 22, 2014, when the fish tank was broken during the final episode. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSH-WdlPPok&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
When [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] television station [[CJON-TV|NTV]] first commenced 24-hour broadcasting in the early-1970s, one of its overnight programs was a continuous shot of a fish tank.

==Denmark==
In the 1980's, the state run television of Denmark [[Danmarks Radio]] aired a program called Pausefisk (pause fish).

==Hong Kong==
The [[Asia Television|ATV]] Network in Hong Kong also aired a Fishcam program, in lieu of [[test card]] after the station signs off the air. The program's name was [[Telefishion]] ({{zh|c=魚樂無窮}}). It became an unexpected hit for the station, with the program performing as well as, if not better than, the station's normal primetime programs. The title of the show entered into popular vocabulary as one being incredibly bored.

==Turkey==
Turkish broadcaster [[Digiturk]] broadcasts live fish tanks in their music channels under the name "Aquavision".

== Netscape ==
[[Netscape]] has a [[web feed]] of their fish tank, and for some time had an [[Easter egg (virtual)|easter egg]] hidden in [[Netscape Communicator]] that would bring that page up when a user pressed CTRL + ALT + F.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/19990208233259/http://cgi.netscape.com:80/fishcam/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20081211093920/http://cgi.netscape.com:80/fishcam/livefishcamsmall.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20081211093915/http://cgi.netscape.com:80/fishcam/livefishcam.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Netscape Fishcam was the 2nd live camera to start broadcasting on the Web.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20010120222600/http://cgi.netscape.com:80/fishcam/fishcam_about.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20000520053033/http://home.netscape.com:80/fishcam/fishcam_about.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20060203071351/http://wp.netscape.com:80/fishcam/fishcam_about.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Netscape Fishcam went off line in the Summer of 2007&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Web/Styling_the_Amazing_Netscape_Fish_Cam_Page&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sonic.net/~undoc/book/chap3.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/American-Online-s-Multi-Identity-Crisis-3023129.php&lt;/ref&gt; and has been moved to a new site a new tank housed in the offices of Zetta, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/animal-cams-the-fascinating-research-tools-we-evolved-to-love&lt;/ref&gt; by its original creator, [[Lou Montulli]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishcam.com/ The Amazing Fishcam!]&lt;/ref&gt; The Fishcam easter egg was present in [[Mozilla Firefox]] and [[SeaMonkey]] until February 15, 2009 and has been moved from netscape/AOL to [[Lou Montulli]]'s Amazing Fishcam .&lt;ref&gt;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=454847&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central/rev/04fe5a9c7432&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishcam.com/ The Amazing Fishcam!]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fred Cairns''' (1857 Scotland &lt;ref name="census1881"&gt;1881/04/03 Comedian / Actor, unmarried aged 24 born Scotland of 4 Devon Street, Liverpool at RG11/3629, f.32, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; – 1 April 1896, [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://freespace.virgin.net/m.killy/sing-c.htm Sing Us One of the Old Songs by Michael Kilgarriff&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1896-05-02: The Era 'Deaths Columns' (page 12 column 3): On 1 April at Johannesburg, South Africa, Fred Cairns, music hall comedian; 1897 The Era Almanac 1897 Obituary Index: Cairns, Fred., Music-hall comedian, 1 April 1896&lt;/ref&gt;) was a well-known British comedian and music hall artist of the Victorian age. He was attached to the [[Lupino family|Lupino]] troupe for several years, operating out of the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton, and toured the [[music hall]]s of the country.

He died on 1 April 1896 in [[Johannesburg]] during a tour of South Africa by the company of Messrs Hyman and Alexander, playing both the Empire Palace of Varieties and Theatre Royal of Varieties. (''The Era'' roundly criticised this situation for not having two companies.)

'''Geek Pop''' is a free online music festival featuring artists inspired by [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= Geek Pop | url= http://bscia-bsba.org.uk/science-orgs/geek-pop/ | accessdate= 13 September 2012 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120314103505/http://bscia-bsba.org.uk/science-orgs/geek-pop/ | archivedate= 14 March 2012 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 2008 and since 2009 has coincided with [[National Science and Engineering Week]] in the UK. In the first festival, hosted by the website [[Null Hypothesis: The Journal of Unlikely Science]] attendees were only able to download a [[podcast]] featuring songs about science as a radio-style festival report.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= Geek Pop 08| publisher=Null Hypothesis | url= http://www.null-hypothesis.co.uk/science/interactive/item/geekpop08 | accessdate=13 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2009, the festival moved to its own website where listeners could listen to a variety of free music and download the radio-style report podcasts, called the "highlights podcast". The Geek Pop website also produces a monthly podcast&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Geek Pop Podcast | publisher=Geek Pop | url=http://geekpop.co.uk/podcast/ | accessdate=13 September 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323205742/http://geekpop.co.uk/podcast/ | archivedate=23 March 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has hosted live events.

==Background==
Online festivals first began in 2003 at the Exposure Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= Exposure Festival Set Times| publisher=trance.nu | url= http://trance.nu/v4/perm/news/11965 | accessdate=13 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Online festivals have a set launch time, but do not happen in a fixed location. They are available online after their launch date.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= Geek Pop Festival| publisher=Geek Pop | url= http://geekpop.podbean.com/festival/ | accessdate=13 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to festivals, online festivals have a set time and celebrate a particular aspect of a community, albeit an online community. The emergence of social media has enabled online festivals to allow people to communicate to each other during the online festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= How Tribeca is changing the way we think about online film festivals| publisher=Mashable.com | url= http://mashable.com/2011/03/21/tribeca-online-film-festival-2011/| accessdate=13 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Geek Pop festivals, this communication is primarily achieved through an online "bar", which uses [[Twitter]] on the website to show tweets about Geek Pop.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= Geek Pop Festival | publisher= We Love Festivals | url= http://www.welovefestivals.com/festivals/2011/Geek-Pop | accessdate= 13 September 2012 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120822121328/http://www.welovefestivals.com/festivals/2011/Geek-Pop | archivedate= 22 August 2012 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are environmental benefits to having an online festival as opposed to, or in conjunction with, a real festival.&lt;ref&gt;Geek Pop, Eco-benefits of virtual festivals, http://www.geekpop.co.uk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316054445/http://www.geekpop.co.uk/ |date=2009-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Half of the acts playing in 2008 were from overseas, but no [[carbon]] was used to "bring" them to a primarily UK audience. There is no litter or waste generated by the festival and the majority of the marketing is done online, reducing the amount of paper needed.

===Media recognition===
Geek Pop '08 was mentioned during podcasts from the [[The Guardian|Guardian]]&lt;ref&gt;Guardian Science podcast, Science Weekly: The Placebo Effect, 3 March 2008, https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2008/mar/03/scienceweeklytheplaceboeff&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nature (journal)|Nature]],&lt;ref&gt;Nature Podcast, 6 March 2008, http://www.nature.com/nature/podcast/v452/n7183/nature-2008-03-06.html&lt;/ref&gt; receiving positive reviews from both – "There were many highlights, but [our] pick of the bunch [is] Dark Matter by science troubadour Johnny Berliner", said Nature. Laboratory Talk said that, "this virtual festival has much to commend it… My personal highpoint was the aching rendition of Hotel Mauna Kea by the Photomixers, demonstrating simultaneously pathos, humour, and even a little musical talent."&lt;ref&gt;Laboratory Talk, 25 November 2008, {{cite web |url=http://www.laboratorytalk.com/newsletters/issue_368.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204112259/http://www.laboratorytalk.com/newsletters/issue_368.html |archivedate=2008-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since March 2008 it has also been featured on Australia's Diffusion Science Radio's 2008 Christmas Special&lt;ref&gt;Diffusion Science Radio, 22 December 2008, http://www.diffusionradio.com/2008/12/christmas_2008_special.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Mr Science Show]].&lt;ref&gt;Mr Science Show, Ep 94: The Geek Pop Virtual Music Festival, 22 December 2008, http://www.mrscienceshow.com/2008/12/ep-94-geek-pop-virtual-music-festival.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geek Pop '09==
Geek Pop '09 was launched on the 6 March 2009. Alongside the two virtual stages imagined in the podcast from the previous year, the reproductive stage and the Tesla Tent, the festival introduced a new main stage which will be called the Tetrahedron stage (in homage to [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury's]] [[Pyramid (geometry)|Pyramid]] stage). The major difference for the 2009 festival from the previous year was its relocation to a standalone website and the introduction of an interactive festival map that allowed listeners to choose songs to listen to.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= Geek Pop| publisher= Geek Pop | url= http://geekpop.podbean.com/festival/2009 | accessdate=13 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geniu$: The Tech Tycoon Game''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Genius Unternehmen Physik''&lt;ref name=CornelsenTech&gt;{{cite web|title=Genius Unternehmen Physik |url=http://www.cornelsen.de/genius/physik/index.html |publisher=Cornelsen |accessdate=May 27, 2011 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724234605/http://www.cornelsen.de/genius/physik/index.html |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[business simulation game]] in which the player operates an industrial business, making products from bicycles to aircraft. New technologies are obtained through physics questions to be solved by the player, occurring at intervals mirroring real-world innovation.

There are two related games, Genius: Task Force Biology ([[German language|German]]: ''Genius: Task Force Biologie''&lt;ref name=CornelsenBio&gt;{{cite web|title=Genius: Task Force Biologie |url=http://www.cornelsen.de/genius/biologie/index.html |publisher=Cornelsen |accessdate=May 27, 2011 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724234626/http://www.cornelsen.de/genius/biologie/index.html |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Genius: Politics ([[German language|German]]: ''Genius: Im Zentrum der Macht''&lt;ref name=CornelsenPolitic&gt;{{cite web|title=Genius: Im Zentrum der Macht |url=http://www.cornelsen.de/genius/politik/index.html |publisher=Cornelsen |accessdate=May 27, 2011 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724234634/http://www.cornelsen.de/genius/politik/index.html |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Gameplay==
To begin, the player chooses one of five cities of varying difficulty to play in: [[Pittsburgh]], [[Detroit]], [[Berlin]], [[London]], and [[Melbourne]]. The player starts with a single bicycle factory in 1850. At the start, the only available factory is the bicycle factory. New factories and other buildings can be obtained through research in the form of in-game puzzles and physics problems.&lt;ref name=gamespot&gt;{{cite web |title=Geniu$: The Tech Tycoon Game |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/geniustechtycoon/index.html |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=May 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527052140/http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/geniustechtycoon/index.html |archivedate=May 27, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As time progresses, the player enlarges the empire by building new factories, mines, and worker housing. The addition of infrastructure such as water and electricity increases productivity. Later, worker amenities such as libraries and schools become available to raise employee morale.&lt;ref name="GeniusHelp"/&gt;

The landscape is presented in [[3/4 perspective]].&lt;ref name=gamespy_review&gt;{{cite web|last=Rausch|first=Allen|title=Geniu$: The Tech Tycoon Game|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/genius/678869p1.html|publisher=GameSpy|accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landscape can be rotated up to 45° left and right from initial, for a total 90° motion.&lt;ref name="GeniusHelp"/&gt;

===Infrastructure===
All buildings need to be connected together by roads so that workers can commute to work. Total demand for products can be increased through shipping, such as road and rail connections at the edge of the map and airports.

One of the earliest infrastructure upgrades is to supply buildings with water and fire coverage, increasing productivity and decreasing fire risk. This done through a pumping station placed at the edge of a body of water and [[water tower]]s to transport it to distant areas, with fire stations placed within the water coverage. When electricity becomes available, the addition of that resource further increases productivity. Electricity is produced by a power plant and spread by [[transformer station]]s.&lt;ref name="GeniusHelp"/&gt;

===Factories===
[[File:Genius Tech Tycoon.PNG|thumb|220px|Typical industrial zone]]
There are nine factory types in game: bicycles, locomotives, [[optics]], motorcycles, automobiles, trucks, [[airship]]s, airplanes, and rockets.&lt;ref name="GeniusHelp"/&gt;

===Natural resources===
The base natural resources involved in production are coal, iron, and rubber. Coal and iron can be mined, while rubber needs to be imported by ship. Coal and iron are mined from rock [[outcrop]]s spread around the landscape. Coal and workers are required for all factories, though certain others also require steel and tires.&lt;ref name="GeniusHelp"&gt;{{cite video game|title = Geniu$: The Tech Tycoon Game|developer = Radon Labs|publisher = Viva Media|date = |platform = PC|version = |scene = |level = |language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workers===
The player is responsible for providing housing to all of the company's employees. The base accommodation is a worker cottage, which can upgrade and eventually be a skyscraper given sufficient demand. The player is also tasked with setting the employee wage. Morale decreases with a decrease or stagnation of wage, leading to increased risk of strikes and financial losses.

==Characters==
There are six characters seen throughout the game: Mr. Hoffman, George, Production Manager Cunningham, Mrs. Friedrichs, Assistant Mary Rogers, and Assistant Henry Wagner. They provide a face and voice for the various physics problems.

==Reception==
Reviews for ''Geniu$: The Tech Tycoon Game'' were generally mixed to positive. Aggregator [[Metacritic]] gives the game an average of 63/100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geniu$: The Tech Tycoon Game|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/geniu-the-tech-tycoon-game/critic-reviews|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen Rausch at [[GameSpy]] rated ''Geniu$'' at 3 out of 5 stars. For him, the game had a good premise but fell short on execution.&lt;ref name=gamespy_review/&gt; He appreciated the attempt at mixing educational content, but was disappointed by the mathematical difficulty of some problems and the shallow gameplay.&lt;ref name=gamespy_reviewp2&gt;{{cite web |last=Rausch |first=Allen |title=Geniu$: The Tech Tycoon Game |url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/genius/678869p2.html |publisher=GameSpy |accessdate=April 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225024227/http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/genius/678869p2.html |archivedate=February 25, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===

====Payment====
The 2013 show, "Resurrection", was followed by many wrestlers claiming that the promotion failed to pay them. A hotel manager in the area has also stated that a large amount of rooms were booked but that the bills were never paid by the promotion. [[Teddy Hart]] has claimed that the responsibility lays with the owners and promoters, John Oniston and Stacey "Angel" Olszak, others have maintained that Teddy was the one who was said to be in charge.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement: Talent Not Paid by Hart Legacy Wrestling |publisher= wrestleview.com|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/roh-indy-wrestling-news/39323-statement-talent-not-paid-by-hart-legacy-wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Complaints grow over Hart family wrestling event|publisher= [[CBC.ca]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/complaints-grow-over-hart-family-wrestling-event-1.1311076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart continued to state that he simply lent his name to the event and featured as a wrestler and did not handle any of the other aspect of the promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/possible-trouble-for-the-new-hart-legacy-wrestling-promotion/|title=Possible trouble for the new Hart Legacy Wrestling promotion?|work=Online World of Wrestling|access-date=2018-01-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ewrestlingnews.com/news/hart-legacy-wrestling-cancels-show-details|title=Hart Legacy Wrestling Cancels Show - Details - eWrestlingNews.com|date=2013-02-04|work=eWrestlingNews.com|access-date=2018-01-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wrestler [[Lance Storm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pwmania.com/lance-storm-talks-problems-hart-legacy-wrestling-event-outstanding-payment-issues|title=Lance Storm Talks Problems With Hart Legacy Wrestling Event &amp; Outstanding Payment Issues {{!}} PWMania|work=PWMania|access-date=2018-01-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jeff Jackson, who served as play by play commentator for the event, have stated that John Oniston who was the promoter for the event had talked to everyone backstage after the show had concluded and ensured them that they would be paid eventually and that they would receive a bonus of 100 [[Canadian dollar|C$]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Former WWE &amp; WCW Superstar Comments On Financial Issues With Hart Legacy Wrestling, Former HLW Executive Provides a Rebuttal To Storm's Comments|publisher= prowrestlingmadness.weebly.com|url= http://prowrestlingmadness.weebly.com/latest-news/former-wwe-wcw-superstar-comments-on-finanical-issues-with-hart-legacy-wrestling-former-hlw-executives-provide-rebuttals-to-storms-comments}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Interview – Lance Storm on Hart Legacy Wrestling|publisher= [[Fight Network]]|url=http://fightnetwork.com/news/6384651:interview-lance-storm-on-hart-legacy-wrestling-full/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hart Legacy Wrestling promotion screws talent and staff over pay |publisher= oklafan.com|url=http://www.oklafan.com/v4/news/6141/article.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013 Jackson told to [[CBC Radio]] once again mentioned that Aniston had said to him and the other workers from the event that they would be given their money later on and that they would be compensated for their troubles. He added that Teddy Hart, David Hart Smith and [[Wayne Hart (wrestling)|Wayne Hart]] were the only Hart family members to be involved in the promotion at the time of the event. He also stated that while he had at the time still not been paid, he said that he did not expect for his payment to ever come. Jackson claimed that the pavilion which the event was held at had at least between 1200 and 1800 people in it and that the cheapest tickets were for 25 C$, so there should not have been any problem to pay everyone. Jackson claimed that HLW originally planned another event on February 22 that was supposed to feature former WWE wrestler [[John Morrison (wrestler)|John Morrison]] but the event was canceled due to issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= CBC Radio talks to Jeff Jackson about Hart Legacy Wrestling|publisher= [[CBC Radio]] |url=https://archive.org/details/CbcRadioTalksToJeffJacksonAboutHartLegacyWrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The February show was replaced by a new promotion handled by the same people and the professional wrestling newsletter ''[[Figure Four Online]]'' made the following statement:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2013/02/07/20560101.html|title=Another big Calgary promotion to debut|author=Oliver, Greg|work=Slam! Wrestling|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|date= April 21, 2015|accessdate=2016-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: "The Hart Legacy Wrestling promotion in Calgary with all the issues regarding payment to wrestlers has shut down, but essentially the same group, without John Oniston, is running a new promotion called AAA Canada Next Generation Wrestling on 2/22 at the Victoria Pavilion in Calgary with John Morrison, Kevin Nash, Davey Boy Smith Jr., Konnan, Teddy Hart, Jack Evans and Necro Butcher. A press conference was scheduled for Calgary today and they claim that all talent has already been paid in advance. They plan to run an iPPV that will be taped for the next day. [[B.J. Annis]] (the father of Teddy Hart) is behind the new company and Spencer Tapley is the front person for talent and media. Tapley wrote a letter to talent, blaming Oniston for being deceitful and said the only reason they were over budget is because others in charge bought airline tickets at the last minute."&lt;ref&gt;''Wrestling Observer Newsletter'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ewrestlingnews.com/news/aaa-canada-set-to-replace-hart-legacy-wrestling|title=AAA Canada Set To Replace Hart Legacy Wrestling - eWrestlingNews.com|date=2013-02-07|work=eWrestlingNews.com|access-date=2018-01-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pwinsider.com/article/75265/new-calgary-promotion-headed-by-teddy-hart-to-replace-hart-legacy-wrestling.html|title=NEW CALGARY PROMOTION HEADED BY TEDDY HART TO REPLACE HART LEGACY WRESTLING {{!}} PWInsider.com|website=www.pwinsider.com|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Immortal''''' is a [[remix album]] of music originally recorded by American recording artist [[Michael Jackson]], and featuring [[The Jackson 5|The Jackson 5/The Jacksons]], released on November 18, 2011 by [[Epic Records]]. The album is a [[soundtrack]] to [[Cirque du Soleil]]'s [[Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour]], which debuted on October 2, 2011 in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref name=bbannouncement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/466976/michael-jacksons-immortal-wont-be-his-last-album-says-estate|title=Michael Jackson's 'Immortal' Won't Be His Last Album, Says Estate|date=2011-10-04|accessdate=2011-10-05|first=Marc|last=Schneider|publisher=Billboard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and release==
On October 3, 2011, [[Sony Music Entertainment]] announced that over 40 of Jackson's original recordings were redesigned and reimagined by the [[Justin Timberlake]] and [[Rihanna]] producer Kevin Antunes throughout a year-period work in the studio with original [[Multitrack recording|multi-track]] [[master recording]]s.&lt;ref name=Immortal_newsletter&gt;{{cite web|title=IMMORTAL, the highly anticipated musical tapestry for Cirque du Soleil's Michael Jackson THE IMMORTAL World Tour|url=http://m.fans.sonymusicemail.com/nl/jsp/m.jsp?c=3176d0f1a67d41fce6|publisher=Sony Music Entertainment|accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence it's expected that ''Immortal'' will continue a similar [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing production]] to the soundtracks to previous Cirque du Soleil's shows: 2006's ''[[Love (The Beatles album)|Love]]'', with the remixed music of [[The Beatles]] (to [[Love (Cirque du Soleil)|the show of the same name]]), and 2010's [[Elvis Presley]]-themed remix soundtrack ''[[Viva Elvis (album)|Viva Elvis]]'' (to [[Viva Elvis|the show of the same name]]).

Being released by [[Epic Records]] in conjunction with estate of Michael Jackson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2011/10/new-michael-jackson-album-immortal-to-be-released/|title=New Michael Jackson Album, 'Immortal', to Be Released|date=2011-10-03|accessdate=2011-10-06|publisher=abc.go.com|work=[[ABC News]]|first=Suzan|last=Clarke}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Immortal'' features an alternative version of The Jackson 5 song "[[ABC (song)|ABC]]",&lt;ref name="bbannouncement"/&gt; as well as a series of [[Mashup (music)|mashups]] and remixes such as a choir-assisted rendition of "[[They Don't Care About Us]]".&lt;ref name=mtvannouncement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1671863/michael-jackson-immortal-album.jhtml|title=Michael Jackson Immortal Album Due November 21|date=2011-10-03|accessdate=2011-10-05|first=Gil|last=Kaufman|publisher=[[MTV.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite over 60 songs had been used for the stage show, the album release will be available as a 20-track album or a deluxe 27-track album only.&lt;ref name=bbannouncement /&gt;

''Immortal'' is the eighth album to be released by Sony and Motown/Universal since Michael Jackson's death on June 25, 2009.

The whole album was unveiled via [[NPR]] on November 18, 2011.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/11/16/142418013/first-listen-michael-jackson-immortal|title=First Listen: Michael Jackson, 'Immortal' : NPR|publisher=NPR|date=2011-11-18|accessdate=2011-11-18|author=Ann Powers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial performance ==
In the United States, an early estimate predicted ''Immortal'' would sell 50,000 copies in its first week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitsdailydouble.com/news/newsPage.cgi?news08781|title=JINGLE BUBLE ALL THE WAY|date=2011-11-23|accessdate=2011-11-28|publisher=hitsdailydouble.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album opened with 43,000 copies sold, debuting  at No. 24 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. ''Immortal'''s opening week was larger than the acrobatic troupe's take on [[Elvis Presley]]'s ''[[Viva Elvis (album)|Viva Elvis]]'', which debuted and peaked at No. 48 in 2010 with 13,000 sold first week.&lt;ref name=bbdebut&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/record-labels/chart-moves-lady-gaga-s-marry-moves-up-michael-1005597362.story|title=Chart Moves: Lady Gaga's 'Marry' Moves Up, Michael Jackson Misses With 'Immortal', Divas Duke It Out|date=2011-12-01|accessdate=2011-12-03|publisher=Billboard.biz|author1=Gary Trust, N.Y.  |author2=Keith Caulfield, L.A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, 150,000 CD copies of this album had been sold during the first week of its release.&lt;ref name=jpdebut /&gt;

''Immortal'' was ranked number 174 on the list of the 200 best-selling albums of 2012 from the year-end charts of Billboard. It also was ranked number 35 on the top-selling 100 R&amp;B albums of 2012. It is estimated that sales of ''Immortal'' as of 2013 are above 2 million units sold worldwide, with over 500,000 of those from the U.S. during 2012. It is currently the second-best selling Cirque show release, after [[Love (Beatles album)|Love]] from the Beatles inspired [[Love (Cirque du Soleil)|show of the same name.]]

== Critical reception ==
The debut song "[[Immortal Megamix]]" received mixed reviews from [[music critics]]. Scott Shetler from ''Popcrash'' said the original songs were "left intact on this remix with only slight musical embellishments, such as a "Michael! Michael!" chant that appears during 'Billie Jean'", and despite other mixes as the "[[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I|HIStory]] Megamix" that preceded his 1995 double-album were better, "with his (Michael Jackson's) legacy of musical gold, it would be nearly impossible to create a bad mix."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popcrush.com/michael-jackson-immortal-megamix/|title=Michael Jackson, ‘Immortal Megamix’ – Song Review|author=Scott Shetler|publisher=popcrash.com|date=2011-11-03|accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album received mixed reviews. Ann Powers from ''[[NPR]]'' said, this soundtrack "adds another dimension to the Jackson omnibus," and it "crafts a new version of Jackson's life story through remixes of his biggest hits and a few obscurities, as well as his own stated favorite songs. "&lt;ref name=NPR /&gt; Kevin Antunes the musical designer for ''Immortal'' said, "There are jewels throughout this entire CD … put there so you can truly appreciate Michael's musicality," and, "It lifts you up, it challenges, it makes you feel. Being a super-fan myself, having the ability to work on this music is a true honor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/story/2011-11-17/michael-jackson-immortal-exclusive-track-cirque-du-soleil/51265870/1|title=Exclusive: Michael Jackson 'Immortal' remix – USATODAY.com|publisher=[[USAToday]]|date=2011-11-16|accessdate=2011-11-19|author=Carly Mallenbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randall Roberts from ''[[latimes.com]]'' gave this album two and a half stars out of four, "the soundtrack is beholden to the Cirque/Immortal story line and therefore sequenced not for the dance floor but for a Las Vegas-style production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/11/album-review-michael-jacksons-immortal.html|title=Album Review: Michael Jackson's "Immortal"|date=2011-11-21|accessdate=2011-11-22|author=Randall Roberts|publisher=[[latimes.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Chad Grischow from ''[[IGN]]'' said, "the collection at least does a fine job pulling from the various eras of his career", and "most of the songs are simply clipped into a shorter version of themselves, with the occasional sound effects to enhance the choreography left feeling odd without it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/121/1213247p1.html|title=Michael Jackson: Immortal Review - MJ tribute too cluttered, chopped to offer good look at his career|author=Chad Grischow|date=2011-11-21|accessdate=2011-11-28|work=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Killian Fox of ''[[The Observer]]'' said, "not much here is new", "the album tries to justify its bulky existence", "but they add little to a catalogue of music that has already been superbly produced." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/20/michael-jackson-immortal-review|title=Michael Jackson: Immortal – review|publisher=[[The Observer]] via [[guardian.co.uk]]|author=Killian Fox|date=2011-11-20|accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arwa Haider from ''[[metro.co.uk]]'' said, "the original songs are obviously fantastic", but "without the accompanying Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, these slightly spooky mixes don't add much to his canon.

Some songs are oddly chopped up, others are spliced together without much finesse, and there are a myriad of sound effects — bullets firing, glass shattering, the whistle of a train, basketballs bouncing — that just sound like noise," and "on stage, it probably all makes sense beautifully", "but without that visual picture, the listening experience is a disappointment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/arts_entertainment/134654878_Album_reviews__Michael_Jackson__Mary_J__Blige__Daughtry.html|title=Album reviews: Michael Jackson, Mary J.

==Background==
Collaborating with many artistic hands, [[Jane Henson]] developed vignettes for her “Nativity Story” at the 2009 [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center|Eugene O’Neill]] Puppetry Theatre Conference and premiered the full show at the [[Orlando Puppet Festival]] in 2010, partnering with daughter [[Heather Henson]] and [[Ibex Puppetry]]. She subsequently sponsored performances in Florida schools and churches, like [[Winter Garden, Florida|Winter Garden]]’s Episcopal Church of the Messiah as well as St. Margaret Mary Catholic School and St. John Evangelical Lutheran Church, both in [[Winter Park, Florida|Winter Park]].

Henson died in 2013, but her “Nativity Story” has continued to tour. The show has been seen at [[St. James Cathedral (Orlando, Florida)|St. James Catholic Cathedral]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]; the [[Cathedral of Saint Andrew (Grand Rapids, Michigan)|Cathedral of St. Andrew]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]; and [[New York City]]’s [[St. Paul the Apostle Church (Manhattan)|St. Paul the Apostle Church]]. There, several of its puppetry scenes were filmed for 2013’s nationally broadcast [[CBS Television]] special “A New York Christmas to Remember,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saltandlighttv.org/christmastoremember/|title=A New York Christmas to Remember at Saint Paul the Apostle|publisher=saltandlighttv.org|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-produced by [[Paulist Productions]] and hosted by [[Regis Philbin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mary Rezac|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/the-nativity-show-from-the-creators-of-the-muppets-27465/|title=The nativity show from the creators of the Muppets|publisher=[[Catholic News Agency]]|date=15 September 2016|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The premiere at Orlando’s St. James Cathedral featured actor-puppeteers [[Sarah Lockard]], Anthony Bolante, Jenny Weaver Barbieri, Curtiss Mitchell, [[Russell Nauman]], and [[Heather Henson]], with set and lighting by Vandy Wood, direction and dramaturgy by [[Sean Keohane]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seth Kubersky|url=http://m.orlandoweekly.com/orlando/live-active-cultures/Content?oid=2246414|title=Live Active Cultures|publisher=[[Orlando Weekly]], [[Orlando, Florida]]|date=11 January 2012|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and music by the [[Olde Noyse Trio]]: John Rata, Cecie Catron, and Craig Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''The Nativity Story'' Acknowledgments|url=https://janehensonnativitystory.wordpress.com/about/acknowledgments/|access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kaddu Beykat''''' (also known as ''Letter from My Village'' and ''Lettre paysanne'') is a [[1975 in film|1975]] [[Senegal]]ese film directed by [[Safi Faye]]. It was the first feature film made by a [[Sub-Sahara]]n African woman to be commercially distributed and brought international recognition for its director.&lt;ref name="NFU"&gt;Ukadike, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LS"&gt;Spaas, p.185&lt;/ref&gt; Centred on a romance, it chronicles the daily lives of people in a rural Senegalese village.

==Plot==
Ngor is a young man living in a Senegalese village who wishes to marry Columba. Ongoing [[drought]] in the village has affected its crop of [[peanut|groundnuts]] and as a result, Ngor cannot afford the [[bride price]] for Columba. He goes to Senegal's capital city, [[Dakar]], to try to earn more money and is exploited there. He returns to the villagers and shares his experiences of the city with the other men. The story, which shows the daily lives of the villagers, is told in the form of a letter to a friend from a villager, voiced by Faye.&lt;ref name="SR"&gt;Russell, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast==
* Assane Faye as Ngor
* Maguette Gueye as Columba

==Background==
''Kaddu Beykat'' is set in Faye's family village, [[Fad'jal]] in southern Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;Thackway, p.151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ns"&gt;Schmidt, p.287&lt;/ref&gt; Financing for the film came from the [[France|French]] Ministry of Cooperation and it was made with a crew of three people.&lt;ref name="GF"&gt;Foster, p.130&lt;/ref&gt; It is a mixture of [[Documentary film|documentary]] and fiction.&lt;ref name=ns /&gt; For some parts of the film, Faye gathered villagers together, gave them a topic of conversation and proceeded to film them.&lt;ref name=ns /&gt; She took advice from the villagers on what to film.&lt;ref name="GF" /&gt; As with her other work, Faye was careful to show African culture from the inside, rather than as an objective observer.&lt;ref name="GF" /&gt; The film is a critique of [[Colonialism|colonial]] farming practices and government policies which have encouraged single-crop farming of [[cash crop]]s for export, in some cases leading villages further into poverty.&lt;ref name="LS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SR" /&gt; The film is dedicated to Faye's grandfather who features in the film, and who died 11 days after filming ended.&lt;ref&gt;Armes, p.79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and reception==
''Kaddu Beykat'' played at the 1976 [[Berlin International Film Festival]] where it won the [[FIPRESCI]] Prize&lt;ref name="JP"&gt;Petrolle, p.177&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[OCIC]] Award. It also won the [[Georges Sadoul Prize]] and an award at the [[Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou]].&lt;ref name="JP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Kerberos Productions Inc.''' is a [[video game developer]] based in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. The company was formed in 2003 by former employees of [[Rockstar Vancouver]].

The company takes its name and logo from [[Cerberus]], a large three-headed creature of Greek mythology (Κέρβερος, in Greek).  The three heads of the hellhound represent the three disciplines of game development: art, programming, and design.

The company has released six games: a [[4X game]] called ''[[Sword of the Stars]]'' (originally published by [[Lighthouse Interactive]], currently published by [[Paradox Interactive]]), its sequel ''[[Sword of the Stars 2]]'', a [[role-playing video game]] titled ''[[Fort Zombie]]'', a rogue-like game ''[[Sword of the Stars: The Pit]]'', a wargame called ''[[Ground Pounders]]'', and an action-strategy game called ''[[Kaiju-a-Gogo]]''

'''''Killing for Culture: An Illustrated History of Death Film from Mondo to Snuff''''' (1994) is the first book in the [[Creation Cinema series]] and deals with death in film and media.

==Summary==
''Killing for Culture'' is a look into death on film including [[mondo films]] and [[snuff film]]s. It is divided into three sections, each with its own focus.

===Feature Film===
This section deals with [[snuff film]]s as seen in fictional movies. &lt;br&gt;
It starts with a chapter on the infamous 1976 film ''[[Snuff (film)|Snuff]]''. Made by husband-and-wife team [[Michael Findlay]] and [[Roberta Findlay]] in 1971, it was left unreleased until 1976 when  [[Allan Shackleton]] added a new ending, a scene depicting what was supposed to be the film crew for the preceding movie murdering one of the actresses. Shackleton marketed the film as authentic snuff and the film was a huge hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kerekes|first=David &amp; Slater, David |title=Killing for Culture |year=1994|publisher=Creation Books|isbn=1-871592-20-8|pages=7–23.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The second chapter starts with an examination of [[Michael Powell (director)|Michael Powell's]] 1960 [[Peeping Tom (film)|''Peeping Tom'']]. The film follows the exploits of a photographer, who in his spare time kills women while filming them. Considered obscene and depraved, even with its lack of nudity or blood, the film ruined Powell's otherwise good career.&lt;br&gt;
The next film looked at in this chapter is [[Joe D'Amato]]'s 1976 film ''[[Emanuelle in America]]'',  part of the [[Black Emanuelle|Emanuelle]] series. Emanuelle, played by [[Laura Gemser]], is a photographer and journalist who investigates a snuff film and gets a little too close to the truth.

===Mondo Film===

This section of the book covered Mondo films, a series of exploitation "[[shockumentary|shockumentaries]]" that presented "actual" footage of deviant sexual activities or death.  Many scenes in these films, while represented as real, were false.

===Death Film===

This section of the book discusses actual deaths caught on film, as presented through the media.  One of the main subjects of the section was the broadcast suicide of Pennsylvania State Senator [[R. Budd Dwyer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5917">A '''light plot''', '''lighting plot''' or just '''plot''' is a document like an architectural [[blueprint]] used specifically by theatrical [[lighting designers]] to illustrate and communicate the lighting design to the director, other designers and finally the [[Electrician (theater)|Master Electrician]] and electrics crew.  The light plot specifies how each [[Stage lighting instrument|lighting instrument]] should be hung, focused, colored, and connected.  Typically the light plot is supplemented by other paperwork such as the channel hookup or instrument schedule.

Up until the development of [[Computer-aided design|Computer Aided Drafting]] (CAD) programs, light plots were hand drawn or [[Technical drawing|drafted]] on special drafting paper.  Though CAD programs and hand drafting require different techniques and methods, the information is presented and used in the same way.  In order to be effective a light plot must:
*Have some uniform [[Architect's scale|scale]] (typically 1/4"=1'-0" or 1/2"=1'-0").
*Define lighting instrument information such as focus, position, color and circuiting.
*Have a title block and legend containing show information and information on how to identify the [[symbols]] on the plot.
*Show the relationship of the lighting instruments to the architecture of the space, scenic elements, and the lighting positions.&lt;ref&gt;Moody, James L.: "Concert Lighting", page 29-51. Focal Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parts of a Plot==
===Plan View===
The plan view is the primary view of the light plot and contains the most information on the lighting instruments and their locations.  As per the design definition, the [[plan view]] illustrates how the venue space would appear to someone above it.  It contains the relevant [[architectural]] information  of the venue space including locations of walls, the floor level, the location of seats and balconies, and occasionally [[sight lines]], as well as the location of each lighting instrument and other relevant hardware, like modular [[dimmer]] boxes.  The plan must also include information on the [[electrical|electrical systems]] of the theater--the location of [[Electrical outlet|outlet]]s connected to the theater's [[dimmers]] and the available lighting positions--rails, booms, side arms, and [[Catwalk (theater)|catwalks]].  The plan view may also contain scenic information, such as a drawing of the [[Set construction|set]].   &lt;ref&gt; Lounsbury, Warren C., Norman C. Boulanger: "Theater Backstage from A to Z", page 147. University of Washington Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section and Elevation View===
The supplementary (and generally optional) section (side) and elevation (front) views contain much of the same information as the plan view.  The section is a cutaway view of the house and stage from either the left or the right.  The section line is typically the venue's [[Parts of a theater|center line]].  The elevation is a plot oriented as if viewing the stage from the audience.  These supplementary views serve primarily to further illustrate relevant architectural and scenic features, including sight lines.  Most commonly the section and elevation plots feature limited electrical information and are used mainly as a reference for the lighting designer or electrician to identify the purpose of each lighting fixture, especially as to how it interacts with any relevant scenic elements.  The elevation and section views might also be provided to the electrics crew as a secondary reference for the positions of lighting instruments.&lt;ref&gt; Lounsbury, Warren C., Norman C. Boulanger: "Theater Backstage from A to Z", page 176 &amp; 61. University of Washington Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lighting Instruments===
The instrument layer contains all the information relating to the lighting instruments.  This includes:
*The specific location of each lighting instrument represented by a unique symbol.
*Information on each instrument including dimmer/channel number, lens size, [[color gel]], and any special augmentations (including color wheels and [[Gobo (lighting)|gobos]]).
*Special notes for the electrics crew, including specific information on how instruments are hung and fastened.
*Auxiliary Lighting units such as [[followspot]]s or a "practicals" (lights which are part of the set, like house lamps, which are used visibly in the performance).

In the past when plots were completely hand drafted, a lighting designer would sometimes plot the lighting instruments on a transparent overlay which could be placed over the plan, section and/or elevation views, therefore allowing the "blank" views (containing only architectural information) to be re-used for other lighting configurations.  The advent of CAD-based lighting design has made this practice obsolete, though occasionally useful.

The information contained in the lighting instruments section should follow consistent, easy to understand rules which are explained in the key, expediting the electric crew's job of hanging and focusing the fixtures.  &lt;ref&gt;Moody, James L.: "Concert Lighting", page 48-49. Focal Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title Block===
The title block contains several pieces of key information on the production including the show title, date, and venue name, as well as the names of the performance's lighting designer and director.  The title block also contains the legend, which identifies all of the drafting symbols used in the plot, as well as any special notes

==Other important lighting paperwork==
In addition to the light plot there are a number of other important pieces of paperwork (i.e. Dimmer hookup, [[Instrument Schedule]], and Magic Sheet) in a complete lighting design.  As each part of the lighting design is relevant only to a specific group of technicians, the entire design is generally provided only to the director and master electrician.

'''Michael Simon White''' (16 January 1936 – 7 March 2016) was a British theatrical [[impresario]] and [[film producer]]. White produced 101 stage productions and 27 films over 50 years.

==Early life==
Michael White was born in Glasgow, Scotland, the son of Doris (Cohen), who became successful in property development and management, and Victor White, who ran a glove making business.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filmreference.com/film/62/Michael-White.html&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was [[Eastern Europe]]an [[Jewish]] and his father was born in Dublin, Ireland.&lt;ref name="Coveney"&gt;{{cite news|last=Coveney|first=Michael|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/09/michael-white-producer-obituary|title=Michael White obituary|work=The Guardian|date=9 March 2016|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As White suffered from [[asthma]] as a boy, his parents decided he would be educated as a boarder at the [[Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz]] in [[Switzerland]] from age 7, where he was the only boy who did not  speak the [[French language]]. He then graduated from the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=Telg3561719/&gt;

==Career==
After working as a [[Wall Street]] runner in [[New York City]] in the 1950s, White took an interest in theatre, spending five years as assistant to [[Peter Daubeny|Sir Peter Daubeny]] for his World Theatre seasons in [[London]].

White produced his first [[West End theatre|West End]] play, the London premiere of  [[Jack Gelber]]'s ''[[The Connection (play)|The Connection]]'' in 1961.&lt;ref name="Coveney"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Other Careers: earning a living in the arts and media |last=Bygrave |first=Mike |author2=Joan Goodman|author3=John Fordham |page=159 |year=1973 |publisher=Wildwood House |isbn=978-0-7045-0052-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Known for bringing the risqué to the stage his productions included ''[[Sleuth (play)|Sleuth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theatre |authorlink=Sheridan Morley |last=Morley |first=Sheridan |page=30 |year=1974 |publisher=[[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]] |isbn=978-0-09-122290-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Oh!

Calcutta! |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/23/alantravis |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=23 December 2000 |accessdate=28 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona (musical)|Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' and the original Theatre Upstairs production of ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]''.

Concurrently, White produced films, including the film version of ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' and ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (both 1975). Later, he was responsible for ''[[The Comic Strip Presents]]...'' with [[Peter Richardson (actor)|Peter Richardson]], which began on the opening night of [[Channel 4]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="Coveney"/&gt;

However, losses on films mounted, and he was declared [[bankrupt]] in 2005 after suffering a [[heart attack]] at the [[Mondrian Hotel]] in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=Telg3561719/&gt;

==Media==
White's autobiography, ''Empty Seats'', was published in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Empty Seats |last=White |first=Michael |publisher=H.Hamilton |edition=1st |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-241-11348-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White's life story was the subject of the 2013 documentary film ''[[The Last Impresario]]'', directed by [[Gracie Otto]]. The film made its world premiere at the [[BFI London Film Festival]] in October 2013,&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Pfeiffer, [http://www.sbs.com.au/movies/article/2013/09/10/gracie-ottos-last-impresario-premiere-london-film-festival "Gracie Otto's The Last Impresario to premiere at London Film Festival"], SBS.com.au, 10 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Cara Nash, [http://filmink.com.au/news/lsquothe-last-impresariorsquo-to-premiere-at-bfi-london-film-festival/ "'The Last Impresario' to premiere at BFI London Film Festival"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505003758/http://filmink.com.au/news/lsquothe-last-impresariorsquo-to-premiere-at-bfi-london-film-festival/ |date=5 May 2014 }}, FilmInk.com.au, 5 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; where it was positively received by critics.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gant, [https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/london-film-review-the-last-impresario-1200776146/ "London Film Review: 'The Last Impresario'"], ''Variety Magazine'', 29 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Dalton, [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/last-impresario-london-review-648136 "The Last Impresario: London Review"], ''The Hollywood Reporter'', 13 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wizardradio.co.uk/news/?p=47 "Review: The Last Impresario"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505003021/http://wizardradio.co.uk/news/?p=47 |date=5 May 2014 }}, WizardRadio.co.uk, 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
White was married twice. With his first wife, the 1960s model and designer [[Sarah Hillsdon]] (1965-1972), he had three children. With his second wife, Louise, an heiress 26 years his junior, he had a son. His ex-girlfriends included film director [[Lyndall Hobbs]].&lt;ref name=Telg3561719&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennaway|first1=Guy|title=Michael White's celebrity photo album|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3561719/Michael-Whites-celebrity-photo-album.html|accessdate=11 August 2014|work=Daily Telegraph|date=5 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Milk Queen''' (often called ''Dairy Princess'' or ''Milk Princess'') is the title awarded to the winner of regularly-organized competitions by [[Dairy]] Associations in many countries.

== Idea ==
The Milk Queen, from a [[marketing]] point of view, is a [[brand]] or product [[testimonial]]. Similar to Apple-, Asparagus-, Beer-, Corn-, Must-, Potato- or Wine Queens&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.daad.de/blog/tandem-reporter/royal-germany-meet-the-highnesses/ Royal Germany – meet the Highnesses], 2011-01-22, ''German Academic Exchange Service - DAAD'' (Retrieved 2013-07-15)&lt;/ref&gt; she promotes a certain [[food group]]. Normally elected for a region, she represents dairy products from this region. The purpose of the Milk Queen is to inform the public of the many benefits of consuming dairy products on a daily basis.  Promotion activities may include appearances at [[trade show]]s or consumer events, primary schools and press conferences.

As a condition, it is expected that Milk Queen candidates will be charming with strong self-esteem, and a basic knowledge about dairy production. Remuneration or financial award is not usually granted to the Queen, but expenses for business traveling and clothing are reimbursed. Some organizers give out prizes to winners, like travels.

'''''Notes on a Scandal''''' ('''''What Was She Thinking? Notes on a Scandal''''' in the U.S.) is a [[2003 in film|2003]] novel by [[Zoë Heller]].  It is about a female teacher at a London [[comprehensive school]] who begins an affair with an [[minor (law)|underage]] pupil. The novel was shortlisted for the 2003 [[Man Booker Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themanbookerprize.com/books/notes-scandal|title=Notes on a Scandal|publisher=Man Booker Prize|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Notes on a Scandal (film)|film version]] was released in 2006, starring [[Judi Dench]] and [[Cate Blanchett]]. The film received four [[Academy Award]] nominations, including nominations for Dench and Blanchett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2007/01/23/here-are-2007-oscar-nominees|title=Here are the 2007 Oscar nominees|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=23 January 2007|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

Barbara, a veteran history teacher at a [[comprehensive school]] in [[London]], is a lonely, unmarried woman in her early sixties, and she is eager to find a close friend. However, she reveals that she has been unable to make a previous friendship last as she was considered by previous friends to be domineering and demanding. Her former friend, teacher Jennifer Dodd, even threatened her with an injunction if she tried contacting her again. When Bathsheba "Sheba" Hart is hired as an art teacher, Barbara immediately feels that they might become close friends. When Sheba invites Barbara for Sunday lunch with her family, she is ecstatic and gives the lunch date enormous significance.

Initially unknown to Barbara, Sheba falls in love with a 15-year-old pupil, Steven Connolly, who is from a deprived background and has [[Dyslexia|literacy problems]]. Although they frequently have sex in risky places, including at school and in the open on [[Hampstead Heath]], the unlikely couple successfully conceal their affair from colleagues and family. During Barbara's first visit to Sheba's residence, she tells Barbara a highly expurgated version of what has happened between her and Connolly, claiming only that he has tried to kiss her and that she discouraged his advances. Barbara offers her some advice on how to cool the boy's ardour, and considers the matter closed.

Sheba confesses to Barbara that despite her apparently charmed life, she feels unfulfilled. Sheba has a difficult relationship with her rebellious seventeen-year-old daughter, Polly, whose youth and beauty only intensify her mother's own feelings of aging and waste. Sheba's husband, Richard, is significantly older than she is, and their relationship sometimes has a father-daughter element to it. Sheba's complaints trouble Barbara, who had considered Sheba to have the perfect family life.

Barbara eventually finds out about the affair on [[Guy Fawkes Night]], when she sees Sheba talking to Connolly on [[Primrose Hill]]. Barbara feels betrayed that Sheba did not confide in her properly about this during the early stages of their friendship, and is angered by Sheba's obsession with Connolly and her relative neglect of their friendship. When Barbara's cat Portia is diagnosed with colon cancer and needs to be [[Euthanasia|euthanised]], she seeks out Sheba for support, only for her to get a call from Connolly during their meeting. Sheba abandons a distraught Barbara in favour of Connolly, compounding Barbara's sense of betrayal from her.

The power dynamics in the relationship between Connolly and Sheba are changing, with Connolly's interest in the affair waning as Sheba's grows. Sheba becomes needier and starts to write love letters to the boy. Sheba secretly visits Connolly in his parents' [[council house]], and Connolly callously insults her when she tries to make conversation with him. Sheba still does not break off the affair, having become quite enslaved to the now barely invested Connolly.

Brian Bangs, a mathematics teacher, asks Barbara to have Saturday lunch with him one day just before Christmas. He confesses his infatuation with Sheba, leading Barbara to realise that he only asked her out to use her as a means to discover information about Sheba's private life. Overcome by [[jealousy]], Barbara alludes to Sheba's secret. ("&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;Sheba likes younger men, you know. ''Much'' younger men.&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; I paused a moment. &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;I mean, you ''are'' aware of her ''unusually'' close relationship with one of the Year Eleven boys? &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;") Afterwards, Barbara is wracked with guilt, but cannot summon up the courage to tell Sheba what she has done. Rather, she hopes Bangs will not report what she has told him.

Sheba's relationship with Polly deteriorates further when the girl's unruly behaviour results in her expulsion from her boarding school. On two occasions, Polly accuses Sheba of having an affair. Sheba is furious about the accusation, believing that she has covered her tracks successfully. Meanwhile, Sheba attempts to take comfort in Connolly throughout her troubles by calling him constantly, and when he fails to answer her calls, she shows up again at his house, only to find that Connolly has taken up with a younger girl and abandoned her. Even this new found evidence of Connolly's loss of interest in her is not enough for Sheba to cease her obsession of him, and she pines for him even knowing she will never hear from him again.

The school's [[head teacher|headmaster]] is somehow informed about the illicit affair — it is implied that the culprit is Bangs. Sheba is [[Suspension (punishment)|suspended]] from her job and charged with [[indecent assault]] on a pupil. Her husband demands that she leave the family home and prevents her from seeing their children, especially their son Ben, who has [[Down's syndrome]]; Polly, meanwhile, refuses to have any contact with her. While Sheba's life is quickly disintegrating, Barbara thrives on the new situation, which she considers her chance to prove her qualities as a friend, even when the headmaster, glad to rid himself of one of his severest critics, forces her into early [[retirement]]. Barbara gives up the [[lease]] on her own small flat and moves with Sheba into temporary accommodation in Sheba's brother's house.

Sheba finds Barbara's manuscript and discovers that she has been writing an account of her relationship with Connolly. She is distraught and furious, not least because Barbara has written about events she did not personally witness, and made judgements about people close to Sheba. She is eventually reconciled with Barbara due to their shared desperation and loneliness, as both have now lost everything. Even now, Barbara uses their desperate circumstances as yet another opportunity to further their relationship, and the mentally weakened Sheba can do little to resist. The novel ends with Sheba, trapped and demoralised, resigning to Barbara's dominance of her.

'''Overlanding''' is self-reliant overland [[travel]] to remote destinations where the journey is the principal goal. Typically, but not exclusively, it is accomplished with mechanized off-road capable transport (from bicycles to trucks) where the principal form of lodging is camping, often lasting for extended lengths of time (months to years) and spanning international boundaries.

==History==
Historically, "overlanding" is an Australian term to denote the [[droving]] of [[livestock]] over very long distances to open up new country or to take livestock to market far from grazing grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Chisholm | first= Alec H.
  | title= = The Australian Encyclopaedia
  | pages = 
  | publisher = Halstead Press
  | location = Sydney
  | year = 1963
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1906 and 1910 [[Alfred Canning]] opened up the [[Canning Stock Route]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070563b.htm Canning, Alfred Wernam (1860 - 1936)] Retrieved on 26 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia overlanding was inspired to a large degree by [[Len Beadell]] who, in the 1940s and 1950s, constructed many of the roads that opened up the Australian [[Outback]].&lt;ref name="Beadell"&gt;{{cite book |last= Beadell|first=Len |title=Bush Bashers |year=1971 |url=http://www.beadell.com.au/index.html |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |publisher=Lansdowne Publishing Pty Ltd. |location=Sydney, Australia |isbn=1-86302-402-6 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Those roads are still used today by Australian overlanders and still hold the names Len gave them; the [[Gunbarrel Highway]], the [[Connie Sue Highway]] (named after his daughter), and the [[Anne Beadell Highway]] (named after his wife).

Overlanding in its most modern form with the use of mechanized transport began in the middle of the last century with the advent of commercially available four-wheel-drive trucks ([[Mercedes-Benz G-Class]]'s, [[Unimog]], [[Jeep]]s and [[Land Rover]]s). Nonetheless, there were a few earlier pioneers travelling in remarkably unsophisticated vehicles. [[File:WESTON MOTORCARAVAN at Winterton Museum.jpg|thumb|The Weston motorcaravan at Winterton Museum]]

In the early 1920s, John Weston and family travelled from Britain to Greece and back in a converted US built Commerce one ton truck with a Continental N engine. At the time, the Weston family was based in Europe but returned to South Africa, their homeland, in 1924, taking the vehicle with them. In 1931, the family set out in the same truck from the south-western tip of Africa and drove to Cairo and on to Britain. Not only is this story well-documented but remarkably the vehicle is still extant. In 1975, following renovation, it featured in the International Veteran and Vintage Car Rally from Durban to Cape Town and was then donated to the Winterton Museum, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, where it can be seen today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnwestonpioneer.info/ Maximilian John Ludwick Weston 1872-1950 Pioneer Aviator and Overland Traveller]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, with the Land Rover brand less than a year old, Colonel Leblanc drove his brand new 80-inch [[Land Rover Series|Series I Land Rover]] from the United Kingdom to [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]].&lt;ref name="Slavin"&gt;{{cite book |author= Slavin, K |author2= Slavin, J |author3= Mackie, GN |author4= McDine, D  |last-author-amp= yes|title=Land Rover The Unbeatable 4x4 |origyear=1981 |url= |accessdate= |edition=Fourth |series= |date= |year=1994|publisher=Haynes Publishing |location=Somerset, UK |isbn=0-85429-950-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There followed many more private journeys, with many groups setting out from Europe for remote African destinations. To aid in these endeavors the [[Automobile Association of South Africa]] published a guide titled ''Trans-African Highways, A Route Book of the Main Trunk Roads in Africa''.&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite book |title=Trans-African Highways a Route Book of the Main Trunk Roads in Africa |origyear=1949 |url= |accessdate= |edition=Fourth |series= |date= |year=1958|publisher=The Automobile Association of South Africa |location=Johannesburg, South Africa |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first edition appeared in 1949 and included sections on choice of vehicle, choice of starting time, petrol supplies, water, provisions, equipment, rules of the road, government officials and rest houses. The serious tone of this book gives some clue as to the magnitude of such a trip, and it was from these beginnings that overlanding developed in Europe and Africa. Notable early examples include [[Barbara Toy]]'s solo overland journeys in a Land Rover, including one in 1951-2 from Tangier to Baghdad, and the 1955-6 [[Oxford and Cambridge Far Eastern Expedition]], which travelled overland from London to Singapore, also in Land Rovers.

One of the most well documented overland journeys was by [[Horatio Nelson Jackson]] in 1903. In 1954, Helen and Frank Schreider drove and sailed the length of the Americas from [[Circle, Alaska]] on the [[Arctic Circle]] to [[Ushuaia]], [[Tierra del Fuego]] in a sea-going ex-army jeep.&lt;ref name="Schreider"&gt;{{cite book |last= Schreider|first=Helen &amp; Frank |title=20,000 Miles South |year=1957 |url= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc. |location=Garden City, New York |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Overlanding Association was created to provide help, support and information to overlanders. To date they have lobbied the European commission and the FIA to improve the rights of Carnet users in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://overlandingassociation.org/category/carnet/ Overlanding Association - Carnet Petition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern overlanding==
Overlanding has increased in the past couple of decades, and is getting ever more popular in large part influenced by the [[Camel Trophy]] event run from 1980 to 2000 with routes crossing some intensely difficult terrain. It is now quite common for groups of overlanders to organize meetings, and an annual meeting is held every Christmas at [[Ushuaia]]. Through the use of the Internet it is much easier to find the information required for extended overland trips in foreign lands and there are several internet forums where travelers can exchange information and tips as well as coordinate planning. While some commercially built overland capable vehicles are produced,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicat.net Unicat - German based manufacturer of large fully outfitted overland trucks.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
many overlanders consider the preparation of their vehicle a paramount part of the experience. Both South Africa and Australia have significant industries based on making accessories for overland travel.

===Commercial overlanding===
The late 1960s saw the advent of commercial overland travel. Companies started offering overland tours to groups in large, specially equipped trucks. Mostly in Africa, these journeys could last for months, and relied heavily on the participation of the paying passengers for food preparation, food purchasing and setting up camp. The ultimate of these adventures was always the 'trans', or the complete journey from Europe to Cape Town in South Africa. Commercial overlanding has since expanded to all the continents of the world.

==Modes of overland travel==

=== Rail ===
At {{convert|9288|km|abbr=in}}, the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] is one of the longest overland journeys in existence today, taking seven days to reach [[Vladivostok]] from [[Moscow]],&lt;ref name="The Man in Seat Sixty-One"&gt;[http://www.seat61.com The Man in Seat Sixty-One&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] [[Seat61]]&lt;/ref&gt; and providing an alternative to air travel for journeys between Europe and Asia.

The [[Indian Pacific]] railway, completed in 1970, links [[Sydney]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in Australia. Covering {{convert|4343|km|abbr=in}} over four days, the railway includes the longest stretch of straight railway line in the world.&lt;ref name="The Man in Seat Sixty-One"/&gt;

The introduction of [[Japan]]'s high speed railway [[Tōkaidō Shinkansen]] in 1964 changed the face of rail travel. The railway has carried more than 4 billion passengers and its new [[N700]] series trains are capable of {{convert|300|km/h|abbr=on}}. France's [[TGV]] holds the record for the fastest train, with a top speed of more than {{convert|500|km/h|abbr=on}}, making it faster than air travel for many journeys within the country.

=== Road ===
The [[Silk Route]] (or Silk Road) historically connects the Mediterranean with Persia and China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9067775/Silk-Road#58379.hook Silk Road - Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Today the route refers to overland journeys between Europe and China, taking either the northern route - through Russia and Kazakhstan - or the southern route - through Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and North India - to [[Urumqi]] or [[Xian]] in China. These routes are still popular today, with companies offering tours on the southern route.

==Overland routes==

=== Trans Africa ===
Some of the longest and more traditional overland routes are in Africa. The Cairo to Cape Town and v.v. route covers more than {{convert|10000|km|abbr=in}} and currently usually follows the Nile River through Egypt and Sudan, continuing to Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia along the way. In 1959 the pioneering American trailer manufacturer Wally Byam and a caravan of trailers travelled the route from Cape Town to Cairo,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbcci.org/club-information/about-us/history Wally Byam Caravan Club International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; via Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe and Zambia), Belgian Congo (now Democratic Republic of Congo), Uganda and north from Kenya. One of the longest current commercial routes is from Reykjavik, Iceland to Cape town, South Africa.

From the mid-1980s, the non-operation of the Aswan to Wadi Halfa ferry between Egypt and Sudan as well instability in Sudan, northern Uganda and Ethiopia, made the journey impossible. In recent years however, the Cape to Cairo and Cairo to Cape Town route has again become possible and increasingly popular both with commercial overland trucks carrying groups of 20 or so paying passengers as well as independent travellers on [[motorcycle]]s or with four-wheel-drive vehicles.

The traditional Trans Africa route is from London to Nairobi, Kenya and Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Shackell, C. &amp; Bracht, I. Africa By Road. 2001, Bradt Publications, Chalfont St. Peter&lt;/ref&gt; The route started in the 1970s and became very popular with small companies using old Bedford four wheel drive trucks carrying about 24 people each, plus lots of independents, normally run by groups of friends in 4x4 [[Land Rover]]s heading out of London from November to March every year. The usual route was from Morocco to Algeria with a Sahara desert crossing into Niger in West Africa, continuing to Nigeria. This was followed by a monthlong journey likened to Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness” through the forests of Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo), surfacing into the relatively modern world in Kenya via Uganda. From Kenya the last leg was south through Tanzania to either Zimbabwe or South Africa.

This route has changed dramatically due to border closures and political instability creating no-go zones. The route has reversed itself somewhat over the last few years, with trucks now crossing from the north to the south of Africa, closely following the west coast all the way from Morocco to Cape Town with the biggest change in the route being made possible by the opening of Angola to tourism. The journey then continues through Southern and East Africa from Cape Town to Nairobi and on to Cairo.

In Africa, commercial overland travel began with the Trans Africa and Cape to Cairo described above.  From the mid-1980s East and Southern Africa became more sought after by tourists and Nairobi to Cape Town is now the most travelled overland route in Africa.  As more tourists look for adventure trips that fit into their annual holiday, shorter sections of overland routes have become available such as two- to three-week round trip from Nairobi taking in Kenya and Uganda.

Istanbul to Cairo, via Syria and Jordan, is a classic overland route. It is a route that has been travelled for centuries, particularly during the Ottoman Empire. Historically it overlapped with the Hajj, with many people covering all or part of the route as part of their pilgrimage to Mecca. Backpackers discovered it in the 1970s and 1980s, with hippies searching for spiritual peace who departed to Jerusalem from Istanbul instead of going to India via Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. After the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, onward travel from Jerusalem to Cairo became a possibility.  It is now well travelled by backpackers and overland companies alike although the amount of travellers journeying the route can be affected by any unrest in neighbouring countries.

'''Petits-Chevaux''', French for "little horses", is a [[gambling]] [[game]] played with a mechanical device consisting of a board perforated with a number of concentric circular slits, in which revolve, each independently on its own axis, figures of [[jockey]]s on horseback, distinguished by numbers or colors. The bystanders having staked their money according to their choice on a board marked in divisions for this purpose, the [[horse]]s are started revolving rapidly together by means of mechanism attached to the board, and the horse which stops nearest a marked goal wins, every player who has staked on that horse receiving so many times his stake. Figures of railway [[trains]] and other objects sometimes take the place of horses. In recent years there has been a tendency to supplant the petits chevaux at French resorts by the boule or ball game, on the same principle of gambling; in this a ball is rolled on a basin-shaped table so that it may eventually settle in one of a number of shallow cups, each marked with a figure.

''Petits-chevaux'' plays a prominent part in the [[Saki]] story, "The Way to the Dairy" (c. 1911).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6276">The '''Philharmonic Society of Corfu''' ({{lang-el|Φιλαρμονική Εταιρεία Κερκύρας}}, ''Philharmonice Ɛtaerɛia Cɛrcyras'', {{IPA-el|filarmoɲiˈci eteˈri.a cerˈciras|pron}}) is today widely known as a community [[Musical ensemble|band]] in [[Corfu|Corfu, Greece]]. However, when it was founded in 1840, its initial scope was to become the first Greek music academy organised on European prototypes. Its first Artistic Director was [[Nikolaos Halikiopoulos Mantzaros]], who retained this office until his death in 1872. The Philharmonic (PSC) had a fully organised programme of tuition both in [[music]] [[theory]] and practice. Its students, who for the first time in modern Hellenic history could learn music regardless of their social class, had the opportunity to be taught by professional musicians and teachers basic music theory, harmony, counterpoint, instrumentation, composition, as well as piano, vocal music, string and wind instruments.

==History==
[[Image:FEK1920.jpg|thumb|left|The wind-band of the Corfu Philharmonic Society on its premises in 1920. The Music Museum of the Society is situated on the 1st floor of this historic building.]]
The tuition of the latter category found its artistic expression through the wind band of the philharmonic, an ensemble, which became very popular by developing into an integral part of public and religious festivities. Nonetheless, the popularity of the band (which was the fourth civilian band of the [[Ionian Islands]] after those of [[Zante]] (1816), Argostoli (1836) and Lixouri (1838) in [[Kefalonia]]) was so strong, that in the end in the public opinion of Corfu 'band' became synonymous to the 'philharmonic'. This misunderstanding, however, became gradually a reality, especially after the [[Second World War]], mainly because of the financial problems that a non-governmental institution like PSC came across. as well as a result of the shortage of professional teachers.

Nonetheless, it was only in 1907, as well as during the 1930s when the symphonic orchestra of the society performed in the [[Municipal Theatre of Corfu]], to much critical acclaim. The symphonic orchestra of the Philharmonic made sporadic appearances until the early postwar years. Since 2003 the orchestra has again commenced its activities (as a result of the re-organization of the tuition of the string instruments within the Society).

In 1979 [[Maria Desylla-Kapodistria]], former mayor of Corfu and the first female mayor in Greece, bequeathed the Kapodistrias summer home under contract No. 4541/3.11.1979 to the Reading Society of Corfu, the Philharmonic Society of Corfu and the Society of Corfiote Studies for the purpose of converting it to a museum dedicated to the memory of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]]. The [[Kapodistrias Museum]], under the stewardship of the three societies, was formally inaugurated in 1981.

The '''Museum of the Corfu Philharmonic Society''', which occupies the first floor of the Society's building (Nikiforou Theotoki 10), opened for the public on September 18, 2010. The Museum attempts to present in brief the history of the institution after almost two centuries of incessant activity (which coincides with some of the most dramatic periods of modern history). Moreover, the Museum honours [[Nikolaos Halikiopoulos Mantzaros]] (1795–1872), the Society’s first artistic director (1841–1872), composer –among others– of the Greek national anthem, well-known music teacher and contrapuntist, as well as inspirer of a whole generation of composers that shaped the music of Ionian Islands, and not only, during the 19th century.

The Museum of the Corfu Philharmonic Society «Nikolaos Halikiopoulos Mantzaros» consists of five thematic sections, which present its activities and history:
# Foundation, Administration, Organization: Features historical documents related to the Society’s early days and organization.
#Educational activities: Presents documents and artifacts related to the music pedagogy within the limits of the Society.
#The concerts: The Philharmonic as a concert society for vocal and orchestral music.
#The wind band: Documents, scores, instruments and artifacts related to the repertory and the activities of the Society’s wind band.
#The people and their work: Important composers and teachers, who related themselves through their presence and their works with the history of the Society, as well as with the development of art music in 19th-century Greece. Scores by [[Spyridon Samaras]] (Spiro Samara), [[Pavlos Carrer]] (Paolo Carrer), the Liberali brothers, [[Spyridon Xyndas]], Domenikos Padovanis, Dionissios Rodotheatos, Alexander Grek, Napoleon Lambelet, Andreas Seiler, as well as women composers from Ionian Islands are exhibited in this section.

The Museum also organizes an annual circle of musicological lectures and has initiated a series of musicological publications. It is open Monday to Saturday from 09.30 until 13.30. The entrance is free.

'''Pitch-pot''' (Chinese: '''Touhu''', Korean: '''Tuho''', Japanese: '''Tōko''') is a traditional East Asian game that requires players to throw sticks from a set distance into a large, sometimes ornate, canister.  "Pitch-pot" is a literal translation of the two Chinese characters in the name (as in "pitch it into the pot"), and is used in Sinological literature. 

The game had originated by the [[Warring States]] period of China, probably invented by archers or soldiers as a pastime during idle periods.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asia Society]], "[http://sites.asiasociety.org/arts/asiangames/power01.html Pitch-Pot: The Scholar's Arrow-Throwing Game]," in ''Asian Games: The Art of Contest''.&lt;/ref&gt; The game began as a game of skill or a drinking game at parties, but by the time it was described in a chapter of the Chinese Classic ''[[Book of Rites]]'', it had acquired Confucian moral overtones.&lt;ref&gt;G. Montell, "T'ou hu — the ancient Chinese pitch‐pot game," ''Ethnos'' 5/1-2 (1940): 70-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially popular among elites, it spread to other classes and remained popular in China until the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. During this time it also spread to Korea and Japan. Today, its popularity in Korea is highest.

==As described in the ''Book of Rites''==

1. According to the rules for Pitch-pot, the host carries the arrows in both his hands put together; the superintendent of the archery carries in the same way the stand on which the tallies were placed; and an attendant holds in his hand the pot.

2. The host entreats (one of the guests), saying, 'I have here these crooked arrows, and this pot with its wry mouth; but we beg you to amuse yourself with them.' The guest says, 'I have partaken, Sir, of your excellent drink and admirable viands; allow me to decline this further proposal for my pleasure.' The host rejoins, 'It is not worth the while for you to decline these poor arrows and pot; let me earnestly beg you to try them.' The guest repeats his refusal, saying, 'I have partaken (of your entertainment), and you would still further have me enjoy myself;--I venture firmly to decline.' The host again addresses his request in the same words, and then the guest says, 'I have firmly declined what you request, but you will not allow me to refuse;--I venture respectfully to obey you.'

The guest then bows twice, and signifies that he will receive (the arrows). The host wheels round, saying, 'Let me get out of the way;' and then at the top of the steps on the east, he bows to the guest and gives him the arrows. The guest wheels round, and says, 'Let me get out of the way.'

3. (The host) having bowed, and received the arrows (for himself), advances to the space between the two pillars. He then retires, and returns to his station, motioning also to the guest to go to his mat (for pitching from).

4. The superintendent of the archery comes forward, and measures the distance of the pot (from the mats), which should be a space of the length of two and a half arrows. He then returns to his station, sets forth the stand for the tallies, and with his face to the east, takes eight counters and stands up. He asks the guest to pitch, saying, 'When the arrow goes straight in, it is reckoned an entry. If you throw a second (without waiting for your opponent to pitch), it is not reckoned.' The victor gives the vanquished a cup to drink; and when the cups of decision have been dispatched, the superintendent begs to set up what he calls 'a horse' for the victor. If he set up one horse, then a second, and finally a third, he begs to congratulate the thrower on the number of his horses. He asks the host to pitch in the same way, and with the same words.

5. He orders the cithern-players to strike up 'The Fox's Head,' with the same interval between (each repetition of the tune), and the director of the music answers, 'Yes.'

6. When the superintendent announces to them on the left and right that the arrows are all used up, he requests them to pitch again. When an arrow enters, he kneels, and puts down a counter. The partners of the guest are on the right, and those of the host on the left.

7. When they have done pitching, he takes up the counters, and says, 'They have done pitching, both on the left and right; allow me to take the numbers.' He then takes the numbers two by two, and leaves the single counters. After this he takes the single counters, and gives the announcement, saying, "Such and such a side has the better by so many doubles, or naming the number of the singles.' If they are equal, he says, 'Left and right are equal.'

8. He then orders the cups to be filled, saying, 'Let the cup go round,' and the cup-bearer (of the successful side) replies, 'Yes.' Those who have to drink all kneel, and raising their cups with both hands, say, 'We 'receive what you give us to drink.' The victors (also) kneel and say, 'We beg respectfully to refresh you.'

9. When this cup has gone round, according to rule, (the superintendent) asks leave to exhibit the 'horses' (of the victorious side). Each 'horse' stands for so many counters. (He who has only) one 'horse' gives it to him who has two, to congratulate him (on his superiority). The usage in congratulating (the most successful) is to say, 'Your three "horses" are all here; allow me to congratulate you on their number.' The guests and host all express their assent. The customary cup goes round, and the superintendent asks leave to remove the 'horses.'

10. The number of the counters varies according to the place in which they kneel (when playing the game). (Each round is with 4 arrows.) (If the game be in) the chamber, there are 5 sets of these; if in the hall, 7; if in the courtyard, 9. The counters are 1 cubit 2 inches long. The neck of the pot is 7 inches long; its belly, 5; and its mouth is 2½ inches in diameter. It contains a peck and 5 pints. It is filled with small beans, to prevent the arrows from leaping out. It is distant from the mats of the players, the length of 2½ arrows. The arrows are made of mulberry wood, or from the zizyphus, without the bark being removed.

11. In Lû, the young people (taking part in the game) were admonished in these words, 'Do not be rude; do not be haughty; do not stand awry; do not talk about irrelevant matters; for those who stand awry, or speak about irrelevant matters, there is the regular (penal) cap.' A similar admonition in Hsieh was to this effect:--'Do not be rude; do not be haughty; do not stand awry; do not speak about irrelevant matters. Those who do any of these things must pay the penalty.'

12. The superintendent of the archery, the overseer of the courtyard, and the capped officers who stood by, all belonged to the party of the guest. The musicians and the boys who acted as attendants, all belonged to the party of the host.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Legge]].

==History of tuho in Korea==
[[File:Hyewon-Imha.tuho-01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|"Playing ''Tuho'' under the Trees" (임하투호; 林下投壺; ''Imha Tuho'') from the ''[[Hyewon Pungsokdo]]'' album of genre paintings by 19th-century Korean painter [[Hyewon]]]]

Tuho appears to have come to Korea from China during the [[Goryeo|Goryeo period]], in 1116 CE, and was popularised by King Yejong. The king's patronage made the previously banned game into a popular courtly pastime, until the influence of the Yuan dynasty once again diminished tuho's popularity.&lt;ref name="Yi2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=I-Hwa Yi|title=Korea's Pastimes and Customs: A Social History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcsMRc6pbQoC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=18 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=Homa &amp; Sekey Books|isbn=978-1-931907-38-5|pages=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fifteenth century, the [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]] revived the game at court, promulgating it as a creation of Confucianism. It was defended from criticism by King Jungjong in 1518, who reaffirmed its respectability and its Confucian connotations. Popularity at court enabled the game to spread through the scholarly and lay community, although the [[Sarim]] scholars of the Late Joseon period dismissed it as frivolous. Despite this tuho was a favourite pastime of the scholar [[Yi Hwang]], who recommended it to his students as a way to develop physical health and mental focus. Tuho was featured (along with Yi Hwang) on the 1000 [[South Korean won|won]] note from 1983-2002, but was left off of the newest version of the 1000 won note which was first issued January 22, 2007.&lt;ref name="Brown2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ju Brown|title=China, Japan, Korea: Culture and Customs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3r-3YH3t45cC&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=7 September 2006|publisher=Ju Brown|isbn=978-1-4196-4893-9|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also recommended by [[Jeong Yak-yong]], in his ''Mongmin Simseo'' (''"Admonitions on Governing the People"'').&lt;ref name="Yi2006"/&gt;

Arrow vases sometimes feature in the sculptural imagery of ''[[norigae]]'' accessories, where they symbolise the rejection of bad fortune.&lt;ref name="LeeYi2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kyung Ja Lee|author2=Kyŏng-ja Yi|title=Norigae: Splendor of the Korean Costume|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3C_SL62UIHkC&amp;pg=PA15-IA1|accessdate=19 March 2013|year=2005|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|isbn=978-89-7300-618-2|pages=15–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YiHong2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kyŏng-ja Yi|author2=Na-yŏng Hong|author3=Suk-hwan Chang|author4=Mi-ryang Yi|title=Traditional Korean Costume|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5unfAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 March 2013|year=2005|publisher=Global Oriental|isbn=978-1-905246-04-5|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tuho in Korea today==
The game is a traditional diversion on [[Korean New Year]]'s Day and [[Chuseok]].  Modern versions are often played with a simple canister and rubber-tipped arrows. The arrows used are usually between 50 and 60&amp;nbsp;cm long, and are thrown at the arrow vase from around ten paces away.&lt;ref name="Ick-dal1974"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kim Ick-dal|title=Korea: Its People and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CMRxAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 March 2013|year=1974|publisher=Hakwŏnsa|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tuho was also a popular drinking game.&lt;ref name="Ásfríðr"/&gt; For every arrow that missed the pot, the loser  or ''bulseung'' (불승/不承, lit. no-success) had to take a drink.&lt;ref name="Ásfríðr"/&gt; To prevent betting on the outcome, losers could opt to sing a song as a penalty instead.&lt;ref name="Ásfríðr"/&gt; Players who did not miss the canister were called ''hyeon'' (현, lit. wise).&lt;ref name="Ásfríðr"/&gt;

[[Image:SeattleKnights Combat.jpg|thumb|left|Male and Female Seattle Knights cross swords]]
Combat is performed by both men and women, utilizing a variety of weapons, including: spears, war hammers, axes, daggers, and swords of almost every variety.  Combatants include knights, mercenaries, rogues, damsels in distress, magic wielders, elves, and a variety of monsters, depending on the needs of the story.  

In the shows, equestrian wargames test the speed, courage, and horsemanship of the mounted Knights.  Jousters contest in armor drawn from many different cultures and periods on a variety of breeds of horses. Warriors awaiting their turn join the audience in heckling, making wagers, and cheering on their favorites.

The more typical shows feature story lines created by Dameon Willich and Darragh Metzger, centering on the fictional land of [[Tír na nÓg]]. As the story goes, this land is entered by crossing the enchanted mists into a world existing parallel to this one. [[Faerie]] folk and humans share this world, however, not always peacefully. The ruling body in this land is referred to as the Greater Fey, who wield powers that help keep their citizens lawful. Conflicts are abated quickly by the Greater Fey and their human Triads. 

A Triad is created by the Greater Fey which choose humans who have proven themselves to be strong, brave and clever. They consist of Cavaliers, the warrior-knights, Rangers, light fighters, and Mystics, wielders of magic. Each Triad is connected to a Faction, designated by a color. This storyline culminates in a tournament, where each Faction may prove its skill through combat, light horse runs, and the joust.

==Other performances==
[[Image:SeattleKnights PiratesPugetSound LadyWashington.JPG|thumb|Seattle Knights as Pirates of the Puget Sound]]

Members of the Seattle Knights perform in two additional shows separate from their traditional medieval performances. 
They perform in a pirate themed show as the "Pirates of Puget Sound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The fantasy-oriented folk music of "A Little Knight Music" has garnered favorable reviews across the northwest. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Training==
Members of the troupe meet weekly to practice and engage in mock battles.&lt;ref name=setimes1 /&gt; When not performing in shows, the Knights gather on weekends at private ranches in Marysville, Renton, and Hobart to practice their equestrian skills and foot combat on outdoor terrain.  Members of the troupe also lead classes, available to the public, for the training of student combatants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5935">'''''Songs in the Key of Z''''' is a book and two compilation albums written and compiled by [[Irwin Chusid]]. The book and albums explore the field of what Chusid coined as "[[outsider music]]". Chusid defines outsider music as; "crackpot and visionary music, where all trails lead essentially one place: over the edge." Chusid's work has brought the music of several leading performers in the outsider genre to wider attention. These include [[Daniel Johnston]], [[Joe Meek]], [[Jandek]] and [[Wesley Willis]]. In addition, his CDs feature some recordings by artists who produced very little work but placed their recordings firmly in the outsider area. Notable amongst these are nursing home resident [[Jack Mudurian]] who sings snatches of several dozen songs in a garbled collection known as ''Downloading the Repertoire'' and the obscure and extreme [[Scat singing|scat]] singer Shooby Taylor AKA 'The Human Horn.'

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12857">{{redirect|Subscription|the subscription process for shares etc.|Subscription (finance)}}The '''subscription business model''' is a [[business model]] in which a customer must pay a recurring price at regular intervals for access to a product or service. The model was pioneered by publishers of books and periodicals in the 17th century&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1 = Clapp |first1 = Sarah L. C. |title = The Beginnings of Subscription Publication in the Seventeenth Century |journal = Modern Philology |volume = 29 |issue = 2 |pages = 199-224 |publisher = The University of Chicago Press |location = Chicago |date = November 1931 |url = https://www.jstor.org/stable/433632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and is now used by many businesses and websites.

==Subscriptions==
Rather than selling products individually, a subscription offers periodic (monthly. yearly, or seasonal) use or access to a [[product (business)|product]] or [[Service (economics)|service]], or, in the case of performance-oriented organizations such as [[List of opera companies|opera companies]], tickets to the entire run of some set number of (eg., five to fifteen) scheduled performances for an entire season. Thus, a one-time sale of a product can become a recurring sale and can build [[brand loyalty]].

Membership [[fee]]s to some types of organizations, such as [[trade union]]s, are also known as subscriptions. Industries that use this model include [[mail order]] [[book sales club]]s and [[music]] sales clubs, [[cable television]], [[satellite television]] providers with [[pay television]] channels, [[satellite radio]], [[Telephone company|telephone companies]], [[Mobile network operator|mobile network operators]], internet providers, [[software publisher]]s, [[website]]s (e.g., [[blogging]] websites), business solutions providers, [[financial services]] firms, [[health club]]s, lawn mowing and snowplowing services, and [[pharmaceutical]]s, as well as the traditional newspapers, magazines, and [[academic journal]]s.

Renewal of a subscription may be periodic and activated automatically so that the cost of a new period is automatically paid for by a pre-authorized charge to a [[credit card]] or a checking account. A common variation of the model in online games and on websites is the ''[[freemium]]'' model, in which a first tier of content is free, but access to premium features (for example, game power-ups or article archives) is limited to paying subscribers.

===Types===
There are different categories of subscriptions:
*A subscription for a fixed set of goods or services, such as one copy of each issue of a newspaper or magazine for a definite period of time. The subtypes are:
** [[Magazine#Paid circulation|Paid circulation]]
** Non-paid circulation
** [[Magazine#Controlled circulation|Controlled circulation]]
*A subscription for unlimited use of a service or collection of services. Usage may be personal and non-transferable, for a family, or under certain circumstances, for a group utilizing a service at one time. In the publishing industry, a subscription to a bundle of several journals, at a discounted price, is known as a "big deal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sally Morris et al. |title= Handbook of Journal Publishing|year= 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-02085-6 |pages=163-164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[wikt:pay-as-you-go|pay-as-you-go]] subscription where you subscribe to purchase a product periodically. This is also known as the convenience model because it is a convenience for the customer to not have to remember to go find their product and buy it periodically. This model has been popularized by companies like Dollar Shave Club, Birchbox, and OrderGroove. Based on their success, many other retailers have begun to offer subscription model services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thoughts.manthan.com/2015/07/16/retail-subscription-models-whos-doing-what-expert-round-up/ Retail Subscription Models! Who's doing what? [EXPERT ROUND-UP]&lt;/ref&gt; 
** For example, a subscription to a rail pass by a company may not be individualized, but might permit all employees of that firm to use the service. For goods with an unlimited supply and for many luxury services, subscriptions of this type are rare.
*A subscription for basic access or minimal service plus some additional charge depending on usage. A basic telephone service pays a pre-determined fee for monthly use but may have extra charges for additional services such as long-distance calls, directory services and pay-per-call services. When the basic service is offered free-of-charge, this business model is often referred to as freemium.

==Effects==
===Vendors===
Businesses benefit because they are assured a predictable and constant revenue stream from subscribed individuals for the duration of the subscriber's agreement. Not only does this greatly reduce uncertainty and the riskiness of the enterprise, but it often provides payment in advance (as with magazines, concert tickets), while allowing customers to become greatly attached to using the service and, therefore, more likely to extend by signing an agreement for the next period close to when the current agreement expires. source from Johnson Cornel, university of TUIR.

In integrated [[Software release life cycle|software]] solutions, for example, the subscription pricing structure is designed so that the revenue stream from the recurring subscriptions is considerably greater than the revenue from simple one-time purchases. In some subscription schemes (like magazines), it also increases sales, by not giving subscribers the option to accept or reject any specific issue. This reduces customer acquisition costs, and allows [[personalized marketing]] or [[database marketing]]. However, a requirement of the system is that the business must have in place an accurate, reliable and timely way to manage and track subscriptions.

From a marketing-analyst perspective, it has the added benefit that the vendor knows the number of currently active members since a subscription typically involves a contractual agreement. This so-called 'contractual' setting facilitates [[customer relationship management]] to a large extent because the analyst knows who is an active customer and who recently churned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/rugrugwps/05_2F348.htm |author=J. Burez &amp; Dirk Van den Poel |title=CRM at a Pay-TV Company: Using Analytical Models to Reduce Customer Attrition by Targeted Marketing for Subscription Services |work=Working Papers of Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, Ghent University, Belgium |year=2006 |publisher=econpapers.repec.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional benefits include a higher average customer lifetime value (ACLV) than that of nonrecurring business models, greater customer inertia and a more committed customer base as it transitions from purchase to opt-out decisions, and more potential for upselling and cross-selling other products or services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Subbly.co: Best Practices for Online Business Models | url=http://www.subbly.co/blog/10-best-practices-for-online-subscription-business-models/ | accessdate = 9 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some software companies such as [[Adobe (company)|Adobe]] and [[Autodesk]] have moved from a perpetual licensing model to a subscription model, known as "[[software as a service]]." This move has significant implications for sales and customer support organizations. Over time, the need to close large deals decreases resulting in lower sales costs. However the size of the customer support organization increases so that the paying customers stay happy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Software Pricing Trends | url=https://www.pwc.com/us/en/technology-innovation-center/assets/softwarepricing_x.pdf | accessdate = 14 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customers===
Consumers may find subscriptions convenient if they believe that they will buy a product on a regular basis and that they might save money. For repeated delivery of the product or service, the customer also saves time.

Subscriptions which exist to support clubs and organizations call their subscribers "members" and they are given access to a group with similar interests. An example might be the Computer Science Book Club.

Subscription pricing can make it easier to pay for expensive items, since it can often be paid for over a period of time and thus can make the product seem more affordable. On the other hand, most newspaper and magazine-type subscriptions are paid upfront, and this might actually prevent some customers from signing up.

An unlimited use subscription to a service for a fixed price may be an advantage for consumers using those services frequently. However, it could be a disadvantage to a customer who plans to use the service frequently, but later does not. The commitment to paying for a package may have been more expensive than a single purchase would have been. In addition, subscription models increase the possibility of [[vendor lock-in]], which can have fatally business-critical implications for a customer if its business depends on the availability of a software: For example, without an online connection to a licensing server to verify the licensing status every once in a while, a software under a subscription-model would typically stop functioning or fall back to the functionality of a freemium version, thereby making it impossible (to continue) to use the software in remote places or in particularly secure environments without internet access, after the vendor has stopped supporting the version or software, or even has gone out of business thereby leaving the customer without a chance to renew the subscription and access his own data or designs maintained with the software (in some businesses it is important to have full access even to old files for decades). Also, consumers may find repeated payments to be onerous.

Subscription models often require or allow the business to gather substantial amounts of information from the customer (such as magazine mailing lists) and this raises issues of [[privacy]].

A subscription model may be beneficial for the software buyer if it forces the supplier to improve its product. Accordingly, a psychological phenomenon may occur when a customer renews a subscription, that may not occur during a one-time transaction: if the buyer is not satisfied with the service, he/she can simply leave the subscription to expire and find another seller.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1012-5169536.html |author=Alorie Gilbert |title=Software Execs Bash Their Industry's Approach |publisher=news.com.com |date=March 3, 2004 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120527035007/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1012-5169536.html |archivedate=May 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is in contrast to many one-time transactions, when customers are forced to make significant commitments through high software prices. Some feel that historically, the "one-time-purchase" model does not give sellers incentive to maintain relationships with their customers (after all, why should they care once they've received their money?). Some who favor a subscription model for software do so because it may change this situation.

The subscription model should align customer and vendor toward common goals, as both stand to benefit if the customer receives value from the subscription.  The customer that receives value is more likely to renew the subscription and possibly at an increased rate.  The customer that does not receive value will, in theory, return to the marketplace.

====Legal====
A customer who is placed in a jail or prison can be billed continuously for subscription services which may render them without funds upon release.

===Environment===
Because customers may not need or want all the items received, this can lead to waste and an adverse effect on the environment, depending on the products. Greater volumes of production, greater energy and natural [[resource consumption]], and subsequently greater disposal costs are incurred.

Subscription models might also create the opposite effect. This can be illustrated by subscribing to a service for mowing lawns. The effective use of a single mower increases when mowing for a collection of homes, instead of every family owning their own lawnmower which is not used as much as the service providing mower, the use of resources for producing lawnmowers, therefore, decreases while lawns stay cut.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3505">'''Teichoscopy''' or teichoscopia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm Teichoscopy&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "viewing from the walls," is a recurring narrative strategy in ancient Greek literature. One famous instance of teichoscopy occurs in Homer's ''[[Iliad]],'' Book 3, lines 121-244.

The passage begins with [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] approached in her chamber by [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], disguised as her sister-in-law [[Laodice (mythology)|Laodice]], the daughter of [[Priam]]. Helen is then led to the walls of the Skaian gates, where she is summoned by Priam, who asks her to point out the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] heroes she sees on the Trojan plain. Below her, the two armies are preparing for the duel between [[Menelaus]] and [[Paris]].  Helen identifies [[Agamemnon]], [[Odysseus]], [[Ajax the Great|Telamonian (Greater) Ajax]], and [[Idomeneus]].  She also mentions that she does not see her brothers [[Castor and Pollux]], who unbeknownst to her are already dead back in Greece. After this scene, the duel commences, with both armies praying to [[Zeus]] and the rest of the gods on [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] to open the action.&lt;ref&gt;Toohey, Peter. ''Reading Epic: An Introduction to Ancient Narratives''.  New York: Routledge, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
According to Maria C. Pantelia, Helen becomes the 'author' of a catalog when she describes for Priam the qualities of the most important Greek warriors."&lt;ref&gt;Pantelia, Maria C. ''Helen and the Last Song for Hector.'' Transactions of the American Philological Association 132.1-2 (2002) 21-27 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/transactions_of_the_american_philological_association/v132/132.1pantelia.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that the teichoscopy, as well as the duel between [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and [[Menelaus]], would have more likely occurred at the beginning of the war rather than during its tenth year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/iliad3.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, although [[Homer]] is not at the beginning of the [[Trojan War]], he is at the beginning of the poem and therefore uses the teichoscopia as a poetic structure that provides information and suspense important for the remainder of the play and the duel to come.

Although teichoscopy can be viewed as simply a vignette that surveys the major Greek warriors, it has been suggested that Homer is also trying to reveal something about Helen.  Helen’s open admiration of both the Greek and [[Troy|Trojan]] warriors is viewed as ironic, as it seems odd that the major cause of a war that has brought devastation to the Trojans should praise the enemy. However, by doing this, Homer is, according to Frederic Will, “insisting on the importance, and centrality, of Helen’s viewpoint.  He is integrating a traditional form artistically.”&lt;ref&gt;Remarks on Counterpoint Characterization in Euripides.  Frederic Will.  ''The Classical Journal'', Vol. 55, No. 8. (May, 1960), pp. 338-344.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3294564].&lt;/ref&gt;

The main object of teichoscopy is the synchronous discussion of events, as opposed to events being reported later by messengers or other eyewitnesses. It is a well-established technique in [[dramaturgy]].

Natural phenomena, too, may be conveyed by this device. Far-off drama such as the sun rising, or a description of stars across the firmament lend themselves to this treatment.

'''''The Painted Veil''''' is a 2006 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[John Curran (director)|John Curran]]. The screenplay by [[Ron Nyswaner]] is based on the 1925 [[The Painted Veil (novel)|novel of the same title]] by [[W. Somerset Maugham]]. [[Edward Norton]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Toby Jones]], [[Anthony Wong Chau Sang]] and [[Liev Schreiber]] appear in the leading roles.

This is the third [[film adaptation]] of the Maugham book, following [[The Painted Veil (1934 film)|a 1934 film]] starring [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Herbert Marshall]] and a 1957 version called ''[[The Seventh Sin]]'' with [[Bill Travers]] and [[Eleanor Parker]].

==Plot==
On a brief trip back to [[London]], earnest, bookish [[Microbiology|bacteriologist]] Walter Fane ([[Edward Norton]]) is dazzled by Kitty Garstin ([[Naomi Watts]]), a vain London socialite. He proposes; she accepts ("only to get as far away from [her] mother as possible"), and the couple [[honeymoon]] in [[Venice]]. They travel on to Walter's medical post in [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]], where he is stationed in a government lab studying [[infectious diseases]]. They find themselves ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British [[expatriate]]s.

Kitty meets Charles Townsend ([[Liev Schreiber]]), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in a clandestine affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of [[adultery]], if she doesn't accompany him to a small village in a remote area of [[Republic of China (1912-49)|China]]. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked [[cholera]] [[epidemic]] sweeping through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly, but he refuses, stating "Why should I put myself through the smallest trouble for you?" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to Charles, he declines to accept, despite earlier claiming to love Kitty.

She is compelled to travel to the mountainous inland region with her husband. They embark upon an arduous, two-week-long overland journey, which would be considerably faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as unhappy and uncomfortable as possible. Upon their arrival in Mei-tan-fu, she is distressed to discover they will be living in near-squalor, far removed from everyone except their cheerful neighbor Waddington, a British deputy commissioner living with Wan Xi (Lu Yan), a young Chinese woman, in relative opulence.

Walter and Kitty barely speak to each other and, except for a cook and a Chinese soldier assigned to guard her, she is alone for long hours. After visiting an orphanage run by a group of French nuns, Kitty volunteers her services, and she is assigned to work in the music room. She is surprised to learn from the Mother Superior that her husband loves children, especially babies. In this setting, she begins to see him in a new light as she learns what a selfless and caring person he can be. When he sees her with the children, he in turn realizes she is not the shallow, selfish person he thought her to be. As Walter's anger and Kitty's unhappiness subside, their marriage begins to blossom in the midst of the epidemic crisis. She soon learns she is pregnant, but is unsure who the father is. Walter – in love with Kitty again – assures her it doesn't matter.

The cholera epidemic takes many victims. As Walter and the locals are starting to get it under control, due to his importation of clean water through a system of aqueducts (as the local people did not understand water-borne infectious disease&lt;ref&gt;[[John Snow (physician)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}}) cholera-carrying refugees from elsewhere pour into the area, forcing Walter to set up a camp outside town. He contracts the disease and Kitty lovingly nurses him, but he dies, and she is devastated. Bereft and pregnant, she leaves China.

Five years later, Kitty appears well-dressed and happy in London shopping with her young son Walter. They meet Townsend by chance on the street, and he suggests that Kitty meet with him. Asking young Walter his age, he realizes from the reply that he might be the boy's father. Kitty rejects his overtures and walks away. When her son asks who Townsend is, she replies "No one important, darling".

==Production==

===Development===
Prior to 1999, producer Sara Colleton sought to develop a script for ''The Painted Veil''. The script was frequently redrafted, being written to be close to the source material, to take liberties with the source material, and to create a [[feminism|feminist]] version. Actor [[Edward Norton]] became involved with the project in 1999.&lt;ref name=encore&gt;{{cite news | author=Charles McGrath | url= | title=Another Encore for the Most Adaptable of Authors | publisher=The New York Times | date=2006-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Norton explained his attraction to the project, "It's very much a story about people getting beyond the worst in themselves and figuring out how to look at each other honestly, forgive each other for their failings and get to a better place... When I read it, I was very affected by it because in it I saw my own failings."&lt;ref name=passion&gt;{{cite news | author=Terry Armour | url= | title=Edward Norton concentrates his passion on performing | publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor suggested casting [[Naomi Watts]] for the role of Kitty, which did not happen until Watts proved herself a bankable star with her performances in ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001) and ''[[21 Grams]]'' (2003).  When Watts joined the project, she recommended director [[John Curran (director)|John Curran]], with whom she had collaborated on the 2004 film ''[[We Don't Live Here Anymore]]''.  The director's expertise with ''We Don't Live Here Anymore'' convinced Watts and Norton that he would be capable of depicting the dysfunctional relationship in ''The Painted Veil''.&lt;ref name=encore/&gt;  The project began development at producers [[Bob Yari]] and [[Mark Gordon]]'s Stratus Film Company, but when Stratus executive Mark Gill left to start [[Warner Independent Pictures]], he brought the project with him.  Gill began production of the film in partnership with Yari. Gill was later fired before the film's completion by [[Warner Bros.]] production president Jeff Robinov, which later led to the film's [[#Marketing|marketing difficulties]].&lt;ref name=trying&gt;{{cite news | author=John Horn | url= | title=Trying to Get People to See 'Veil' | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=2006-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yari and Warner Independent Pictures collaborated with a Chinese partner who was granted approval over the script and the finished film. The partnership permitted a budget of $19 million for ''The Painted Veil''. When the Chinese production company reviewed the film, it was unhappy with the depiction of the Chinese uprising and the cholera victims, requesting that the scenes be revised. Norton and Curran expressed concerns that their studio accepted the censorship too quickly, with the director threatening to remove his name from the film. Their pressure resulted in limiting cuts from the film to only 38 seconds' worth.&lt;ref name=trying/&gt;

===Writing===
Screenwriter [[Ron Nyswaner]] and Norton collaborated on the screenplay for the film.  The 1925 novel by author [[W. Somerset Maugham]] was considered one-dimensional, so Norton altered the story so the character Walter Fane had a more enhanced role.  The character was also rewritten to make his peace with his wife Kitty, leading to them falling in love with each other.  Norton explained, "I like to think that we didn't change the book so much as liberate it.  We just imagined it on a slightly bigger scale, and made external some of what is internal in the novel."  Norton described the novel as "almost unremittingly bleak" and believed that the author had thought that British colonials were unlikely to change.  The actor explained of the change to the story, "I went on the assumption that if you were willing to allow Walter and Kitty to grow... you had the potential for a love story that was both tragic and meaningful."&lt;ref name=encore/&gt;  Norton considered ''The Painted Veil'' to be in the spirit of films like ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' (1985) and ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' (1996), seeing it as "rooted in really looking at the way that men and women hurt each other".&lt;ref name=passion/&gt;

Director [[John Curran (director)|John Curran]] suggested setting the film during 1925, when the events of the [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese nationalist]] movement were taking place. Norton, who had studied Chinese history at [[Yale University]], agreed with the suggestion. To detail scenes from the time period, Curran, Norton, and Nyswaner relied on excerpts from historian [[Jonathan Spence]]'s 1969 book ''To Change China'', which covered the inept efforts of Western advisers during these years. Norton described the character Walter Fane served as "the proxy for the arrogance of Western rationalism", explaining about Fane's confusion at the lack of gratitude for his help, "Walter means well, but he's the folly of empire, and that adds a whole new dimension to what happens in the story. It's a metaphor for the way empires get crushed."&lt;ref name=encore/&gt;

===Filming===
Filming took place on location in [[Shanghai, China]]. The director did not want to build a set for the cholera-stricken village, instead seeking out an untouched parcel of land in China. He found Huang Yao Ancient Town (黄姚古镇 - huáng yáo gǔ zhèn) in [[Guangxi]] Zhuang Autonomous Region, which served as the location for the village. The director described the location, "Even the Chinese crew members were amazed at the place we found... It was like going back in time." According to Nyswaner, a large amount of time of the film production was spent negotiating with the Chinese government for the completion of the film, as there were disagreements over issues in the script.&lt;ref name=encore/&gt; Most of the film was shot in [[Guangxi]]. Director John Curran commented, "We wanted this movie to be distinctly Chinese. We didn’t want it to look like a film that you could shoot in [[Canada]] or [[Mexico]] or [[Italy]]." After a search of location in [[Hunan]] province, the scouts chose the location in Guangxi  for the film. Line producer Antonia Barnard states that initially the film, like the novel, was going to be set in Hong Kong; however, the crew realized Hong Kong of the time period would be difficult to replicate, thus the story was altered so it would take place in Shanghai; the crew shot "Shanghai for Shanghai in the period, and shot London scenes in Shanghai as well."

===Music===
The official soundtrack is composed by [[Alexandre Desplat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.soundtrackinfo.com/title/tracks.asp?paintedveil | title=The Painted Veil (2006) | publisher=[[the SoundtrackINFO Project]] | accessdate=2011-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
The film's post-production schedule was initially slated to conclude in late summer 2006, but did not finish until November.  According to Laura Kim, the marketing and publicity head of [[Warner Independent Pictures]], the delay slowed award and media recognition for the film. Other studios were duplicating DVDs of their films for awards organizations, so ''The Painted Veil'' was unable to get first priority in processing. When ''The Painted Veil'' experienced a limited release in the [[United States]] on December 20, 2006 in the cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]], the meager marketing campaign for the film was criticized. The lack of attention caused half a dozen people associated with the film to complain about how [[Warner Independent Pictures]] was conducting the marketing campaign. Film critic [[Rex Reed]] of ''[[The New York Observer]]'' wrote, "Nobody can understand why Warner Independent Pictures is keeping this movie such a secret; it is filled with Oscar possibilities that should be shouted from the rooftops."&lt;ref name=trying/&gt;

The firing of Mark Gill, one of the initial producers of ''The Painted Veil'' who brought it to Warner Independent Pictures, was cited as a reason for the small scale of the film's marketing campaign. Director [[John Curran (director)|John Curran]] explained about the move to Warner Independent, "Any transition is not going to be ideal. When the guy who has gotten you on board is gone, you're kind of exposed." Others also criticized the studio for not providing a large enough marketing budget, pointing out that the previous year's ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]'' had a more successful campaign with television and newspaper ads. ''The Painted Veil'' was eventually able to expand to 23 more markets on December 29, 2006, with additional cities on January 5, 2007. Warner Independent also hosted 80 screenings of ''The Painted Veil'' in Los Angeles, New York, [[San Francisco]], and [[London]], as well as to various Hollywood guilds, to promote the film.&lt;ref name=trying/&gt;

==Release==

===Box office===
''The Painted Veil'' initially had a [[limited release]] in four theaters in the [[United States]] on December 20, 2006, grossing $51,086 over the opening weekend.  The film gradually expanded its showings in the United States and [[Canada]], peaking at 287 theaters on the weekend of January 26, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=paintedveil.htm | title=The Painted Veil (2006) - Weekend Box Office Results | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Painted Veil'' ultimately grossed $8,060,487 in the United States and Canada and $14,525,904 in other territories for a worldwide total of $22,586,391.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=paintedveil.htm | title=The Painted Veil (2006) | accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
On the film review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Painted Veil'' has received a 74% 'fresh' rating based on 143 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/painted_veil/ | title=The Painted Veil | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the similar website [[Metacritic]], the film has received a metascore of 69 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, considered generally favorable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/paintedveil | title=Painted Veil, The (2006): Reviews | publisher=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manohla Dargis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the story seems "so unlikely for modern adaptation, particularly when, as is the case here, it hasn’t been refitted with a contemporary hook or allegory for audiences who wouldn’t know Maugham from [[Edna Ferber]]. Instead, as nicely directed by John Curran and adapted to the screen by Ron Nyswaner, this version of the story lulls you by turning Maugham’s distaff [[bildungsroman]] into a fine romance. Even better, the new film gives us ample opportunity to spend time with Ms. Watts, whose remarkable talent helps keep movie faith and love alive, even in the tinniest, tiniest vehicles . . . An inveterate stealer and masticator of scenes, Mr. Norton is very fine here, especially early on, before his billing gets the better of the story and he begins riding around heroically on horseback . . . Whether through craft or constitution, [he] invests Walter with a petty cruelty that makes his character’s emotional thaw and Kitty’s predicament all the more poignant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dargis |first=Manohla |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/12/20/movies/20veil.html |title='&amp;#39;New York Times'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carina Chocano of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said the film "has all the elements in place to be a great epic, but it fails to connect, to paraphrase Maugham's contemporary [[E.M. Forster]], the prose with the passion. It's impeccable, but leaves you cold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/cl-et-painted20dec20,0,7424259.story |title='&amp;#39;Los Angeles Times'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Calendarlive.com |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated the film three out of four stars and commented, "If you're suspecting this third movie version of W. Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel may carry the infectious dullness of prestige filmmaking, rest easy . . . the film is a [[period piece]] propelled by emotions accessible to a modern audience . . . ''The Painted Veil'' has the power and intimacy of a timeless love story. By all means, let it sweep you away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-painted-veil-20061212 |title='&amp;#39;Rolling Stone'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Rollingstone.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meghan Keane of the ''[[New York Sun]]'' said the film "may at times threaten to fall into an abyss of sentimentality, and it has moments that seem mere transitions to propel the plot, but it manages a charming historic portrait without insulting the audience's intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/letting-love-blossom-in-the-face-of-disease/45494/ |title='&amp;#39;New York Sun'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Nysun.com |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' thought the story "feels remote and old-school despite a frankness the two previous film versions lacked." He added, "Present scripter Ron Nyswaner makes some solid fundamental decisions, beginning with the telescoping down to the barest minimum the London-set opening . . . All the same, the film is still dominated by the stuffy, repressed personality of Fane, whose emotional stonewalling of his wife produces a stifling of Kitty's naturally more vivacious, if common, personality. Despite the extremes of human experience on view, there is a certain blandness to them as they play out, a sensation matched by the eye-catching but picture-postcard-like presentation of the settings . . .

'''''Two Strangers and a Wedding''''' is a controversial radio competition created and first hosted in Australia.

In order to win the competition, two contestants who have not met or made contact with each other must be chosen by the station's listeners. They then have to get married legitimately to win prizes.

== Australian competitions ==
The first promotions were held in Adelaide and Sydney, Australia on [[2Day FM]] and [[SAFM]] and then on several other Australian stations in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The couple involved in the two-day FM promotion were Glenn Emerton and Lief Bunyan. Glenn Emerton later met Naomi Kennedy and married in March 2006.

== UK competitions ==
[[Birmingham]] radio station [[BRMB]] has married two sets of couples, and both of these contests have sparked a national interest. In 1999, the first couple were matched by a panel of relationship counsellors and astrologers, including astrologer [[Russell Grant]]. The groom was 28-year-old Greg Cordell, a sales manager, and his chosen bride was Carla Germaine, a 23-year-old former model. Also to make it to the last four girls was her long-term schoolfriend Joanna Scragg who later married successful banker Rob Cook.

The couple married, on air nationally and online; however, they split soon after the wedding. Carla later met and married [[Jeremy Kyle]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.BRMB.co.uk/Article.asp?id=160316 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230037/http://www.brmb.co.uk/Article.asp?id=160316 |date=27 September 2007 }} - BRMB Website - Where are they Now?&lt;/ref&gt; who at the time was one of the radio station's DJs. They have 2 daughters and a son together. It was announced in September 2015 that they have since separated.

Later on in 2006, another couple were married. Again, the station received national interest. Becky, 28, and Craig, 30, were chosen for the stunt.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brmb.co.uk/Article.asp?id=171860 - BRMB Website - The Big Day&lt;/ref&gt; Despite protests against the wedding, the two were married. The couple flew to [[Bermuda]] the day after the wedding for their [[honeymoon]].

Four months later on 7 May 2006, the ''[[News of the World]]'' reported the couple had split, but not divorced. These reports were confirmed on the morning radio show ''The Big Brum Breakfast'', when Becky (the bride) was interviewed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

== New Zealand competitions ==
New Zealand radio station [[The Edge (radio station)|The Edge]] ran a similar competition where they married Zane Nichol and Paula Stockwell in 1999, they now have two sons and a daughter.

In 2003, The Edge also married Steve Veix and Kersha Taylor. Again, the two are also still together and have a son, Mitchell. In early 2006, it was revealed that due to Steve's long days working on the couple's farm, Kersha suffered post-natal depression which she has since beaten. On Wednesday 16 January 2008, Kersha gave birth to their second son Finn.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiochick.co.nz/TheEdge/2Strangers/SteveKersha.aspx - RadioChick Information on Setve and Kerhsa winner of The Edge competition in 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The Edge ran 3 Strangers and a Wedding in 2007 where the bride has to pick which man out of 2 she will marry on the actual wedding day.
Chantelle Swanson picked Paul Court as her groom on 27 September 2007 in Auckland, New Zealand. In March 2010 Chantelle gave birth to the couple's first child Taylor Thomas Court on Sunday 7 March 2010. He weighed 8 pounds, 12 ounces.

== Other competitions ==
95.5 [[WPLJ]], a New York radio station, in 2006 married a couple. They were together for six months before divorcing.&lt;ref&gt;http://kipesquire.powerblogs.com/posts/1144327486.shtml - A Stitch in Haste - Two Strangers and a Divorce&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar contests have been run in Los Angeles, Budapest, Hungary and in Estonia.
95.5 [[KLOS]] in Los Angeles also ran, a variant of the competition called "Three Strangers and a Wedding" in 2007, this time the twist was that the Bride had to choose her groom in 60 seconds based on first looks. The couple split up after 1 week. She has a nickname of the Naughty Nurse.

Most recently [[WTMX]] in Chicago ran 2 Strangers - Is Love Blind and the final couple refused to get married at the altar claiming marriage was too serious to be entered into via a radio competition.

The two most successful European 'social experiments' were held in Dublin on 98FM where the final couple are still together and have a child and in Budapest, Hungary where the couple from Danubius Radio are now media celebrities attending chat shows and film premieres.

More recently '2 Strangers' has also run successfully in on the WIL Cornbread show in St Louis, Energy FM on Calgary &amp; and Kaya FM Johannesburg.

In Sept/Oct of 2008, Energy 101.5 of Calgary, Alberta, Canada ran Two Strangers and A Wedding. The Bride and Groom were to get married the last week of October. At the altar they opted out of marriage. They were to go on a date after the wedding and also spent a weekend with his family. No new info has been given since then.

In February 2009, a contest was launched by [[Waterford]] [[Radio in Ireland#Independent Regional Radio|regional station]] [[Beat 102-103]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beattwostrangersandawedding.com/index.php |title=Two strangers and a wedding? |date=12 April 2009 |publisher=[[Beat 102-103]] |accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 85 entrants, with the winners meeting minutes before the ceremony in April. The ceremony was legally void, since three months' notice is required. However, provision was made for a future legal ceremony and use of a shared house. The couple went to Portugal for a week's "honeymoon", accompanied by station staff. Upon their return, they split up, with the "bride" commenting, "I'm definitely not going to see him again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0415/1224244720828.html |title=Couple who "married" minutes after meeting break up after honeymoon |last=de Faoite |first=Dara |date=15 April 2009 |work=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=2009-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11055">{{short description|quote from Hamlet}}
"'''What a piece of work is man!"''' is a phrase within a soliloquy by [[Prince Hamlet]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Hamlet|play of the same name]]. Hamlet is reflecting, at first admiringly, and then despairingly, on the human condition.

==The speech==

The [[soliloquy]], spoken in the play by [[Prince Hamlet]] to [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]] in Act II, Scene 2, follows in its entirety. Rather than appearing in [[blank verse]], the typical mode of composition of Shakespeare's plays, the speech appears in straight prose:

{{quote|I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation  prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the King and  queene: moult no feather. I have of late, (but wherefore I know not) lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition; that this goodly frame the earth, seems to me a sterile  promontory; this most excellent canopy the air, look you, this brave o'er hanging firmament, this majestical roof, fretted with golden fire: why, it appeareth no other thing to me, than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is man, How noble in reason, how infinite in faculty, In form and moving  how express and admirable, In action how like an Angel, In apprehension how like a god, The beauty of the  world, The paragon of animals. And yet to me, what is  this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor Woman neither; though by your smiling you seem to say so.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William. ''The Globe illustrated Shakespeare.  The complete works, annotated, Deluxe Edition'', (1986). ''Hamlet'', Act II, scene 2, page 1879. Greenwich House, Inc. a division of Arlington House, Inc. distributed by Crown Publishers, Inc., 225 Park Avenue South, New York, NY 10003, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Meaning==
Hamlet is saying that although humans may appear to think and act "nobly" they are essentially "dust".  Hamlet is expressing his melancholy to his old friends over the difference between the best that men aspire to be, and how they actually behave; the great divide that depresses him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=SparkNotes|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/hamlet/quotes.html|title=Hamlet quotes|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between texts==
The speech was fully omitted from [[Nicholas Ling]]'s 1603 [[Hamlet Q1|First Quarto]], which reads simply:

{{quote|Yes faith, this great world you see contents me not,&lt;br&gt;No nor the spangled heauens, nor earth, nor sea,&lt;br&gt;No nor Man that is so glorious a creature,&lt;br&gt;Contents not me, no nor woman too, though you laugh.&lt;ref&gt;''The First Edition of the Tragedy of Hamlet: London, 1603'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=3SNAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT37 p. 37]. Nicholas Ling &amp; J. Trundell, 1603. Reprinted by The Shakespeare Press, 1825.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This version has been argued to have been a [[bad quarto]], a tourbook copy, or an initial draft. By the 1604 [[Hamlet Q2|Second Quarto]], the speech is essentially present but punctuated differently:

{{quote|What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason,&lt;br/&gt;how infinite in faculties, in form and moving,&lt;br/&gt;how express and admirable in action, how like an angel in apprehension,&lt;br/&gt;how like a god!}}

Then, by the 1623 [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)#Folios|First Folio]], it appeared as:

{{quote|What a piece of worke is a man! how Noble in&lt;br /&gt;Reason? how infinite in faculty? in forme and mouing&lt;br /&gt;how expresse and admirable? in Action, how like an Angel?&lt;br /&gt;in apprehension, how like a God? ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=ShaHamF.sgm&amp;images=images%2Fmodeng&amp;data=%2Ftexts%2Fenglish%2Fmodeng%2Fparsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=5&amp;division=div2 |title=Hamlet (1623 First Folio edition) |accessdate=2017-09-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018001320/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=ShaHamF.sgm&amp;images=images%2Fmodeng&amp;data=%2Ftexts%2Fenglish%2Fmodeng%2Fparsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=5&amp;division=div2 |archivedate=October 18, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[J. Dover Wilson]], in his notes in the ''New Shakespeare'' edition, observed that the Folio text "involves two grave difficulties", namely that according to Elizabethan thought angels could apprehend but not act, making "in action how like an angel" nonsensical, and that "express" (which as an adjective means "direct and purposive") makes sense applied to "action", but goes very awkwardly with "form and moving".&lt;ref&gt;''The New Shakespeare: Hamlet.'' Cambridge University Press, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

These difficulties are remedied if we read it thus:

{{quote|What a piece of worke is a man! how Noble in&lt;br /&gt;Reason? how infinite in faculty, in forme, and mouing &lt;br /&gt;how expresse and admirable in Action, how like an Angel &lt;br&gt; in apprehension, how like a God?}}

==Sources==
A source well known to Shakespeare is Psalm 8, especially verse 5: "You have made [humans] a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned them with glory and honor."

Scholars have pointed out this section's similarities to lines written by [[Montaigne]]:

{{quote|''Qui luy a persuadé que ce branle admirable de la voute celeste, la lumiere eternelle de ces flambeaux roulans si fierement sur sa teste, les mouvemens espouventables de ceste mer infinie, soyent establis et se continuent tant de siecles, pour sa commodité et pour son service ? Est-il possible de rien imaginer si ridicule, que ceste miserable et chetive creature, qui n’est pas seulement maistresse de soy, exposée aux offences de toutes choses, se die maistresse et emperiere de l’univers?''

Who have persuaded [man] that this admirable moving of heavens vaults, that the eternal light of these lampes so fiercely rowling over his head, that the horror-moving and continuall motion of this infinite vaste ocean were established, and continue so many ages for his commoditie and service?  Is it possible to imagine so ridiculous as this miserable and wretched creature, which is not so much as master of himselfe, exposed and subject to offences of all things, and yet dareth call himself Master and Emperor.}}

However, rather than being a direct influence on Shakespeare, Montaigne may have merely been reacting to the same general atmosphere of the time, making the source of these lines one of context rather than direct influence.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, Ronald. "Hamlet and Counter-Humanism." Renaissance Quarterly 52.4 (1999): 1046-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
* At the conclusion of the [[Lindsay Anderson]] film ''[[Britannia Hospital]]'' (1982), the computer which is the outcome of Professor Millar's Genesis project recites "What a piece of Work is a Man" up to "how like a God", at which point it repeats the line over and over.
*In the film ''[[Down and Out in Beverly Hills]]'' (1986), Jerry Baskin, played by [[Nick Nolte]], recites this speech on the pier.
*In Bruce Robinson's British film ''[[Withnail &amp; I]]'' (1987), the credits roll after lead character Withnail recites the monologue to an audience of wolves in London Zoo.
*In ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'' (1993), Union Colonel [[Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain]] recites from the speech while discussing slavery. To which Sergeant Kilrain responds "Well, if he's an angel, all right then... But he damn well must be a killer angel."
* In the film ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'' (1997), Mr. Newberry says to Martin: "What a piece of work is man!  How noble... oh, fuck it, let's have a drink and forget the whole damn thing."
* In the film [[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa|''Madagascar 2: Escape 2 Africa'']] (2008), the penguin "Private" tries to enter code into the ship's navigation system by randomly jumping on the keyboard. A section of text on the screen that was entered as "WhATApiece OFworkisPenGuin".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eeggs.com/items/47993.html|title=Madagascar Easter Egg - I Don't Know the Codes... Well|last=eeggs.com|website=www.eeggs.com|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a possible reference to the [[Infinite monkey theorem]].
*In the stop motion animation film ''[[Coraline]]'' (2009), the other Ms. Spink and Forcible recite it while performing their trapeze acrobatics.
*In the vampire film ''[[Only Lovers Left Alive]]'' (2013), directed by [[Jim Jarmusch]], parts of the monologue are quoted.  Notably, Adam ([[Tom Hiddleston]]) utters "quintessence of dust" at the death bed of the vampire Marlowe.  The plot includes the suggestion that the latter was the original author of the [[Shakespeare]] oeuvre, as some eccentric critics have argued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marloweshakespeare.org/|title=The International Marlowe-Shakespeare Society|website=www.marloweshakespeare.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage productions===
*In the 1967 [[rock musical]] ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', numerous lyrics are derived from ''Hamlet'', most notably a song titled "What a Piece of Work is Man", which uses much of the speech verbatim.
*In the [[Reduced Shakespeare Company]]'s production ''[[The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (abridged)]]'', the more famous soliloquy, "[[To be, or not to be]]," is omitted from the Hamlet portion of the production, not for time constraints, or because the speech is so well known, but because the group states that they dislike the speech for momentum and motivation reasons. The "What a piece of work is a man" speech is delivered in its stead.

===Television===

* In the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' episode "[[The Paragon of Animals]]", one of the characters, Byron, recites ''[[Hamlet]]'''s "how noble is man..." speech to [[Lyta Alexander]].
* In the third-season finale of ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'', titled "Deus Ex Machina", part of the monologue is paraphrased by the character John Greer, instead referencing the artificial intelligence system known as The Machine: "What a piece of work is your Machine, Harold. "In action, how like an angel. In apprehension, how like a god.""
* The ninth episode of the seventh season of ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' is titled "What A Piece Of Work Is Man". This is a reference to the Shakespearean influence of the hit TV series.
* In the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode “[[Hide and Q]]”, [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] mocks humanity to Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] by means of Shakespeare quotes. Picard retorts by paraphrasing Hamlet's monologue, noting that "what he might say with irony, I say with conviction."
* In season 12 episode 13 of ''ER'', reference is made by Dr. Victor Clemente to Shakespeare as being how he knows the meaning of the word quintessence. Later he paraphrases the "What a piece of work is man!" monologue while at the bedside of his girlfriend who has just suffered multiple gunshot wounds from her husband.
