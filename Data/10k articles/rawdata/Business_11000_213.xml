'''Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani''' ({{lang-fa|اکبر هاشمی رفسنجانی|Akbar Hāshemī Rafsanjānī}} {{Audio|Fa-ir-hashemi.ogg|pronunciation}} or '''Hashemi Bahramani''', often mistakenly known as ''Ali Akbar'' Hashemi Rafsanjani &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/world/middleeast/ayatollah-rafsanjani-dead.html?_r=0 |title=Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Ex-President of Iran, Dies at 82 |website=nytimes.com |date=2017-01-08 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;; 25 August 1934 – 8 January 2017) was an influential [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] politician, writer and one of the founding fathers of the [[Islamic Republic]] who was the fourth [[President of Iran]] from 3 August 1989 until 3 August 1997. He was the head of the [[Assembly of Experts]] from 2007 until 2011, when he decided not to nominate himself for the post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/story/214628.html In Rafsanjani’s election to key post, Iran moderates see victory] Indian Express, 6 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/iran_rafsanjani_assembly_of_experts/2331272.html Iran's Rafsanjani Loses Key Post On Assembly Of Experts] Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 8 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the chairman of the [[Expediency Discernment Council]].

During the final years of the [[Iran–Iraq War]], Rafsanjani was the ''de facto'' commander-in-chief of the Iranian military. He was elected chairman of the [[Iranian parliament]] in 1980, serving until 1989. He played an important role in the choice of [[Ali Khamenei]] as Supreme Leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/16/iran-election-rafsanjani-defends-decision-stand|title=Iran election: Rafsanjani defends decision to stand as his 'national duty'|author=Ian Black|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rafsanjani became president of Iran after winning the [[Iranian presidential election, 1989|1989 election]]. He served another term by winning the election in [[Iranian presidential election, 1993|1993]]. In the [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|2005 election]] he ran for a third term in office, placing first in the first round of elections but ultimately losing to rival [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] in the run-off. He and his family faced political isolation for their support of the opposition [[2009 Iranian presidential election protests|in 2009]].

With [[Hassan Rouhani]]'s election, in which Rafsanjani openly supported him, the Rafsanjani family gradually recovered their political reputation. Rafsanjani died following a heart attack on 8 January 2017 in a hospital in Tehran at the age of 82.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38548591 |title=Iran's ex-President Rafsanjani dies at 82|date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/08/former-iranian-president-akbar-hashemi-rafsanjani-dead.html|title=Former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani dead|date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/iran-president-hashemi-rafsanjani-dies-82-170108163407762.html|title=Iran's ex-president Hashemi Rafsanjani dies at 82|date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rafsanjani has been described as having been a pragmatic [[Islamic]] [[conservative]]. ''[[The Economist]]'' called him a "veteran kingmaker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iranian politics after the nuclear deal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21699462-supreme-leader-clipping-wings-reformist-president-whos|accessdate=29 May 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supported a [[free market]] position domestically, favoring [[privatization]] of state-owned industries and a moderate position internationally, seeking to avoid conflict with the [[United States]] and [[Western world|the West]].&lt;ref&gt;RK Ramazani ''Revolutionary Iran: Challenge and Response in the Middle East', The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also founder and one of the Board of Trustees of [[Azad University]].

== Early life and education ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hashemi Rafsanjani 1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The young Rafsanjani in 1949]] --&gt;
Rafsanjani was born on 25 August 1934 in the village of [[Bahreman]] near the city of [[Rafsanjan]] in [[Kerman Province]], to a wealthy family of [[pistachio]] farmers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/specials/iranelections/bios/Hashemi-Rafsanjani.asp Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061228044033/http://www.rferl.org/specials/iranelections/bios/Hashemi-Rafsanjani.asp |date=28 December 2006 }} from Radio Free Europe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1342637.html|title=Iran Report: May 9, 2005|publisher=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had seven siblings.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/1d400dda-9d4c-11d9-a227-00000e2511c8.html|title=Rafsanjani's possible return creates a buzz in Tehran|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Mirza Ali Hashemi Behramani, was one of Kerman's famous businessmen and a [[Pistachio]] merchant.

He left at the age of 14 to study theology in [[Qom]]. There he became acquainted with the ideas of Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], the most senior dissident cleric who later became the founder of the [[Islamic Republic]], on the political rule of the clergy. He studied theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22494982|title=Profile: Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other teachers were [[Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi]], [[Mohammad-Reza Golpaygani]], [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari]], [[Abdul-Karim Ha'eri Yazdi]], [[Shahab al-Din Mar'ashi Najafi]], [[Nematollah Salehi Najafabadi]], [[Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i]], and [[Hussein-Ali Montazeri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hamshahrionline.ir/news-32244.aspx|title=زندگینامه اکبرهاشمی رفسنجانی|date=9 January 2017|access-date=10 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614142241/http://hamshahrionline.ir/news-32244.aspx|archive-date=14 June 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==

=== Pre-Revolution struggles ===
When he was studying at [[Qom Seminary]], he became interested in politics under [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]. He was one of the opposition of [[Mohammad Reza Shah]]'s [[White Revolution]] and accompanied with Khomeini. With Khomeini's exile, Hashemi's role in the fight against the Shah and representing Khomeini in the country was highlighted. This opposition eventually led to his arrest and imprisonment. He was arrested for 7 times from 1960 until 1979 and was in jail for four years and 5 months in total due to his clandestine activities against Pahlavi regime. Despite the anti-Western attitude of revolutionaries, he had traveled to 20 states of the [[United States]]. Although individual major pre-revolutionary speeches against Shah regime, But Khomeini acted him as financial manager of revolutionary struggle as well as connector with other revolutionary groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/influential-former-iranian-president-hospitalized-162420955.html|title=Rafsanjani, Iran leader whose life mirrored nation's, dies|date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the groups that had a deep bond with Hashemi, was the [[Islamic Coalition Party]], which is known as responsible for the assassination of former [[Prime Minister of Iran|Prime Minister]] [[Hassan Ali Mansur]]. This communication was another reason for his arrest. In prison, he found the opportunity to become familiar with other groups opposed to the Shah.

=== After the revolution ===
After the victory of [[Iranian Revolution]], Hashemi became one of the members of [[Council of Islamic Revolution]]. He was one of the powerful members of the council from its establishment. He was also deputy interior minister at that time and later became the acting interior minister.

He was one of the 28 founders of Traditional right-wing [[Combatant Clergy Association]] and also one of the members of the central committee of [[Islamic Republican Party]] at the first years of the revolution. Years later, it was him that requested IRP's dissolution. His political acumen and Khomeini's full trust helped Rafsanjani as one of the most powerful politicians in Iran at that time. At the time, he was the closest person to the Khomeini and ruled as his  "eyes and ears". According to the ''Gold'', [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] was established with the help of Hashemi.

At [[Iranian hostage crisis]] in 1980, Hashemi Rafsanjani mentioned it as "one of the largest manufacturer in the history". However, on the tenth anniversary of the revolution, he said in an interview that according to the experiences of these years, the hostage was "wrong".

Hashemi served as one of the [[List of Tehran's Friday Prayer Imams|Tehran's Friday Prayer Imams]] (for next thirty years), Representative of Khomeini at Defence High Council (after death of [[Mostafa Chamran]]) and Second-in-Command of Iran's Joint Chiefs of Staff in the last year of [[Iran–Iraq War]]. He forced Khomeini to accept to end the war. Only three months after his appointment as Iran's deputy commander-in-chief, Iran accepted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 598]] and eight-year war was ended.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-rafsanjani-death-idUSKBN14S0V9|title=Rafsanjani, dead at 82, was one of the titans of post-revolutionary Iran|date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chairmanship of the Parliament ==
[[File:President Rajaei Inauguration at Majlis.jpg|thumb|left|Hashemi as parliament chairman in the inauguration of [[Mohammad-Ali Rajai]]]]
Iran's first [[Election Law]] was developed with Hashemi's partnership. He nominated as one of the [[Islamic Republican Party]]'s candidates in the [[Iranian legislative election, 1980|1980 legislative election]] in [[Tehran]]. He gained 1,151,514 (54%) votes and ranked 15. Rafsanjani was the Speaker of [[Parliament of Iran]] for 9 years. He was elected as the speaker in 1980 in the first season of Parliament after the [[Iranian Revolution]]. He was also chairman in the second season and first year of the third parliament. After the death of [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], founder of the [[Islamic Republic]] and election of then-President [[Ali Khamenei]] as new supreme leader, he joined the [[Iranian presidential election, 1989|1989 presidential race]] and became the [[President of Iran|President]], leaving Parliament.

He had a determining role in the dismissal of [[Abulhassan Banisadr]] as commander-in-chief of Iranian military and then his impeachment in the parliament as Iran's first president in June 1981. In the summer of 1981, he protested to the veto of the parliament's plan by the [[Guardian Council]] and informed it to Ruhollah Khomeini. This led to the establishment of [[Expediency Discernment Council]], which later he chaired the council. He had an active role in [[Iran–Contra affair]], which was divulged by [[Mehdi Hashemi]] and failed. Mehdi Hashemi was executed but Rafsanjani was the loser at internal dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/akbar-hashemi-rafsanjani-influential-former-iranian-president-dies-age-82/|title=Influential former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani dies age 82|date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KhatamiRafsanjani.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Rafsanjani as the chairman of the parliament with future President [[Mohammad Khatami]]]]
In [[Iranian presidential election, October 1981|October 1981 presidential election]], when he voted to [[Ali Khamenei]], he said it's vote of "Imam (Khomeini), clerics and the parliament". During differences between Prime Minister [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]] and Khamenei, Hashemi cleverly managed to keep the position favor or against these two perspectives and take the middle position. According to Bahman Bakhtiari, at that time Mousavi was the leader of the [[Iranian reform movement|left-wing]], and Khamenei the [[Iranian Principlists|right-wing]]. With the death of Khomeini (one of the supporters of leftists), leftists were weakened. In such circumstances, Hashemi leaped for a powerful presidency.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-01-08/hashemi-rafsanjani-former-iranian-president-dies-at-age-82|title=Rouhani Loses Key Ally as Former Iran Leader Rafsanjani Dies|date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presidency ==
[[File:Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani 02.jpg|thumb|left|Rafsanjani with newly elected Supreme Leader, [[Ali Khamenei]], 1989]]

=== Domestic policy ===
Rafsanjani advocated a free market economy. With the state's coffers full, Rafsanjani pursued an economic liberalization policy.&lt;ref name="r" /&gt; Rafsanjani's support for a deal with the United States over Iran's nuclear program and his free-market economic policies contrasted with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his allies, who advocate maintaining a hard line against Western intervention in the Middle East while pursuing a policy of economic redistribution to Iran's poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,,1804628,00.html|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Voice of ambition|date=23 June 2006|accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By espousing World Bank inspired structural adjustment policies, Rafsanjani desired a modern industrial-based economy integrated into the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;Book: Factional politics in post-Khomeini Iran By Mehdi Moslem&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Some Iranian commanders of Iran-Iraq War.jpg|thumb|Hashemi with some Iranian commanders of [[Iran–Iraq War]]]]
During his presidency, a period in which Rafsanjani is described by western media sources as having been the most powerful figure in Iran, people ordered executed by the [[judicial system of Iran]] included political dissidents, drug offenders, Communists, Kurds, Bahais, and even Islamic clerics.&lt;ref name="critic" /&gt;

The Iranian [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|Mojahedin]] were recognized as a terrorist organization by both the Iranian government as well as the United States CIA. Regarding the Mojahedin, Rafsanjani said (''Ettela'at'', 31 October 1981):

{{quote|God's law prescribes four punishments for them (the Mojahedin). 1-Kill them. 2-Hang them, 3-Cut off their hands and feet 4-Banish them. If we had killed two hundred of them right after the Revolution, their numbers would not have mounted this way. I repeat that according to the Quran, we are determined to destroy all [Mojahedin] who display enmity against Islam.}}

Rafsanjani also worked with Khamenei to maintain the stability of government after the death of Khomeini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Menashri|title=post revolutionary politics In iran|page=62|year=2001|publisher=Frank Cass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign policy ===
[[File:Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Kofi Annan in Tehran.jpg|thumb|left|Hashemi meeting with former [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]]]]
Following years of deterioration in foreign relations under Khomeini during the Iran–Iraq War, Rafsanjani sought to rebuild ties with Arab states&lt;ref&gt;Mafinezam, Alidad and Aria Mehrabi, ''Iran and its Place Among Nations'', Greenwood, 2008, p.37&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with countries in [[Central Asia]] and the Caucasus, including [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohaddessin, Mohammad, ''Islamic Fundamentalism'', Anmol, 2003, pp.70–72&lt;/ref&gt; However, relations with European countries and the United States remained poor, even though Rafsanjani had a track record of handling difficult situations and defusing crises.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/748/re1.htm Al-Ahram Weekly|Region|Showdown in Tehran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112173351/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/748/re1.htm |date=12 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He condemned both the [[United States]] and [[Iraq]] during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] in 1991. After the war he strove to renew close ties with the West, although he refused to lift [[Khomeini]]'s fatwa against the British author [[Salman Rushdie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9450584 Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani Biography – Biography.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rafsanjani said that Iran is ready to assist Iraq, "expecting nothing in return", he also said that "peace and stability" is a function of the "evacuation of the occupiers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-24/0612281096010001.htm Iran ready for comprehensive assistance to the Iraqi nation – Rafsanjani – Irna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114004735/http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-24/0612281096010001.htm |date=14 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran gave humanitarian help to the victims of the conflict. Iran sent truckloads of food and medicine to Iraq, and thousands of Kuwaiti refugees were given shelter in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;''Iran's Persian Gulf Policy: From Khomeini to Khatami'', by Christin Marschall&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2016}}

Rafsanjani voiced support to Prince Abdullah's peace initiative and to "everything the Palestinians agree to". He also stated that what he called "Iran's international interests" must take precedence over those of Iranian allies in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Ayatollah Rafsanjani is a supporter of Iran's nuclear program. In 2007 Rafsanjani reiterated that the use of weapons of mass destruction was not part of the Islamic Republic culture. Rafsanjani said: "You [US and allies] are saying that you cannot trust Iran would not use its nuclear achievements in the military industries, but we are ready to give you full assurances in this respect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iran/2007/iran-070223-irna03.htm|title=Rafsanjani reassures West Iran not after A-bomb|author=John Pike|publisher=globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Economist]]'', he is regarded by many Iranians "as the only person with the guile and clout to strike a deal with the West to end economic sanctions" imposed upon the country due to its nuclear program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21578110-two-last-ditch-presidential-contenders-may-rattle-ruling-clerics-candidacy|title=A candidacy conundrum|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== After presidency ==
[[File:IRAN election.jpg|thumb|left|Hashemi supporters in the [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|2005 election]]]]
Post-presidency, Rafsanjani delivered a sermon at [[Tehran University]] in the summer of 1999 praising government use of force to suppress student demonstrations.&lt;ref name="critic"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sciolino|first=Elaine|date=19 July 2009|title=Iranian Critic Quotes Khomeini Principles|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/world/middleeast/19assess.html?_r=1&amp;hp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, in the first election after the end of his presidency, Rafsanjani ran again for Parliament. In the [[Tehran]] contest, Rafsanjani came in 30th, or last, place. At first, he was not among the 30 representatives of Tehran elected, as announced by the [[Iranian Ministry of the Interior]], but the [[Council of Guardians]] then ruled numerous ballots void, leading to accusations of ballot fraud in Rafsanjani's favor.&lt;ref name="critic" /&gt;

[[File:Golpaygani-Rafsanjani-Ahmadinejad.jpg|thumb|Rafsanjani in [[Eid al-Fitr]] prayer, while [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] is sitting at his side]]
In December 2006, Rafsanjani was elected to the [[Assembly of Experts]] representing Tehran with more than 1.5 million votes, which was more than any other candidate. Ahmadinejad's opponents won the majority of local election seats. On 4 September 2007 he was elected Chairman of the [[Assembly of Experts]], the body that selects Iran's [[Supreme Leader of Iran|supreme leader]], in what was considered a blow to the supporters of [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]. He won the chairmanship with 41 votes of the 76 cast.

Rafsanjani has advocated [[freedom of expression]], [[Toleration|tolerance]] and [[civil society]].

Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani was chairman of the [[Assembly of Experts]], which is responsible for appointing or removing the Supreme Leader, who has been rumored to not be in the best of health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Iran_Sources_Dismiss_Buzz_Over_Khamenei_Health/1852718.html Iran Sources Dismiss Buzz Over Khamenei Health] RFEFL, 15 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; After the disputed results of the election were certified by the Supreme Leader, Rafsanjani was reported to have called a meeting of the Assembly of Experts, but it is unknown what the outcome or disposition of this meeting actually was.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/14/iran-ahmadinejad-mousavi-elections-result World leaders urged by Iran's opposition party to reject Ahmadinejad's alleged victory] Julian Borger and Ian Black, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Rafsanjani relocated from Tehran to [[Qom]], where the country's religious leaders sit.

{{Wikinews|Former Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani leads Friday prayers}}
On 17 July 2009, Rafsanjani publicly addressed the election crisis, mass arrests and the issue of freedom of expression during [[Friday prayers]]. The prayers witnessed an extremely large crowd that resembled the Friday prayers early after the revolution. Supporters of both reformist and conservative parties took part in the event. During prayers, Rafsanjani argued the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobile.chicagotribune.com/inf/infomo?view=nationworld_article&amp;feed:a=chi_trib_5min&amp;feed:c=nationworld&amp;feed:i=48120341&amp;nopaging=1 "Rafsanjani backs tolerance, dialogue"] ''Los Angeles Times'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

We should let our media write within the framework of the law and we should not impose restrictions on them. ... We should let our media even criticize us.

His support for the [[Iranian Green Movement|Green Movement]] reinvigorated his image among the urban middle-class segments of Iranian society who made up the bulk of the movement and solidified Rafsanjani's role as a backer of factions within Iran that advocated the reform of the system to ensure its survival.

=== Assembly of Experts election ===
On 8 March 2011 Rafsanjani lost his post as chairman of the powerful [[Assembly of Experts]], replaced by Ayatollah [[Mohammad-Reza Mahdavi Kani]]. Rafsanjani stated that he withdrew from the election for chairman to "avoid division." The loss was said to be the result of intensive lobbying "in recent weeks" by "hardliners and supporters" of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], and part of Rafsanjani's gradual loss of power over the years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2057794,00.html Iran: Ex-Leader Rafsanjani Loses Role] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311144422/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2057794,00.html |date=11 March 2011 }}, by AP / Ali Akbar Dareini, 8 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later years ===
Reformers had enjoyed his support in recent years, helping to tilt the balance of power towards more moderate forces who managed to win the presidential poll in 2013 with the victory of [[Hassan Rouhani]] and parliamentary elections in [[Iranian legislative election, 2016|2016]].

Rafsanjani could not act as a political horse trader—for example, he could not prevent reformist candidates from being disqualified—but his role in guiding reformist politicians was a crucial one and, up to a point, he was able to influence Khamenei by preventing him from making one-sided decisions. Hardliners now have a chance to completely surround the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] and block moderate influences. Rafsanjani played politics the way it was played during the time of Ayatollah Khomeini—or at least, that is what he wanted you to believe—but with his death the so-called "Imam's Line," key figures from the beginning of the [[Iranian Revolution|Revolution]], who were close to [[Khomeini]]—is near its end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/08/how-akbar-hashemi-rafsanjani-s-death-will-empower-the-ayatollah.html|title=How Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's Death Will Empower the Ayatollah|date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also kept his traditional connections with the clergy in the holy city of [[Qom]] and with conservative forces within the political establishment, which made it difficult for hardliners to form a strong front against moderate forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/44b5fcda-d5ed-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e|title=Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iranian politician, 1934–2017|date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After winning reelection to his seat at [[Assembly of Experts]] as Tehran district's first person, Rafsanjani announced that it was the last time that he joined an election as a candidate and will be retired from politics at the end of the current term. He also said "Now I can die with peace of mind" after seeing election of a moderate parliament in the [[Iranian legislative election, 2016|2016 legislative election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/01/iran-reformists-stand-lose-rafsanjani-death-170109100325733.html|title=Iran's reformists stand to lose from Rafsanjani's death|date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government announced three days of [[National day of mourning|national mourning]] and a public holiday on his funeral day. Black banners were raised in Tehran and other cities and some posters showed the Supreme Leader and Rafsanjani together smiling. Five days of mourning also observed in the southern province of [[Kerman]], where Ayatollah Rafsanjani's hometown of [[Rafsanjan]] is located.

Two months after his death, a street in [[Tehran]]'s [[Sa'adat Abad]] was renamed in his honour. Many streets in other cities also named Hashemi Rafsanjani. The central building of [[Azad University]] also named as Hashemi Building and a statue of him was installed outside of the building. Kerman International Airport was also renamed to [[Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani Airport]].

Rafsanjani was sought by the Argentinian government for ordering the [[1994 AMIA bombing]] in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/world/middleeast/ayatollah-rafsanjani-dead.html Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Ex-President of Iran, Dies at 82]&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the allegation that senior Iranian officials planned the attack in an August 1993 meeting, including Khamenei, the Supreme Leader, [[Mohammad Hejazi]], Khamenei's intelligence and security advisor, Rafsanjani, then president, [[Ali Fallahian]], then intelligence minister, and [[Ali Akbar Velayati]], then foreign minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barsky|first=Yehudit|title=Hizballah|url=http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/Hizballah_052003.pdf|work=The American Jewish Committee|accessdate=5 August 2013|format=Terrorism Briefing|date=May 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184824/http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/Hizballah_052003.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 during the [[Mykonos restaurant assassinations|Mykonos trial]] in Germany, it was declared that Rafsanjani, the then president of Iran, alongside Ayatollah Khamenei, Velayati and Fallahian had a role in the assassination of Iran's opposition activists in Europe.

=== Tension with Ahmadinejad ===
After his loss at the presidential elections in 2005, a growing tension between him and President Ahmadinejad arose. Rafsanjani has criticized Ahmadinejad's administration several times for conducting a purge of government officials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4443856.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Rafsanjani slams Iran president|date=17 November 2005|accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; slow move towards [[Privatization in Iran|privatization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6290101.stm|work=BBC News|title=Criticism of Ahmadinejad mounts|date=23 January 2007|accessdate=23 April 2010|first=Frances|last=Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recently hostile foreign policy in particular the atomic energy policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roozonline.com/english/archives/2007/11/rafsanjani_ahmadinejad_engage.html Rafsanjani, Ahmadinejad Engage in New War of Words (ROOZ: English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116061350/http://www.roozonline.com/english/archives/2007/11/rafsanjani_ahmadinejad_engage.html |date=16 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In return Ahmadinejad fought back that Rafsanjani failed to differentiate privatization with the corrupt takeover of government-owned companies and of foreign policies which led to [[sanctions against Iran]] in 1995 and 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rajanews.com/News/?6881 حمله به دولت در اولين كنفرانس خبري پس از 9 سال Raja News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308092523/http://www.rajanews.com/News/?6881 |date=8 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rajanews.com/News/?5081 نمی‌پذیریم عده ای حرف خود را به نام سند چشم انداز مطرح کنند Raja News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129055653/http://www.rajanews.com/News/?5081 |date=29 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also implicitly denounced Rafsanjani and his followers by calling those who criticize his nuclear program as "traitors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7090901.stm|work=BBC News|title=Iran president attacks 'traitors'|date=12 November 2007|accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a debate with [[Mir-Hossein Moussavi]] in [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential election]], Ahmadinejad accused Hashemi of corruption. Hashemi released an open letter in which he complained about what he called the president's "insults, lies and false allegations" and asked the country's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/11/world/middleeast/11iran.html?ref=aliakbarhashemirafsanjani&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|first=Robert F. |last=Worth|title=In Iran Race, Ex-Leader Works to Oust President|date=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tension with Khamenei ===
In his latter years, Rafsanjani had disagreements with [[Ali Khamenei]] who has the last say in everything in [[Iran]]. Khamenei even indirectly called Rafsanjani a traitor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/03/khamenei-rafsanjani-treason-mohammadi-tweet-missiles.html&lt;/ref&gt; Khamenei acknowledged that he and Rafsanjani had differences after Rafsanjani's death,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2017/01/08/505384/Iran-Leader-Ayatollah-Seyyed-Ali-Khamenei-Expediency-Council-Ayatollah-Akbar-Hashemi-Rafsanjani&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to Rafsanjani as [[Hujjat al-Islam]] (lower clerical rank than [[Ayatollah]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://eaworldview.com/2017/01/iran-daily-regime-buries-former-president-rafsanjani/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=khamenei_ir|author=Khamenei.ir|number=818193262469120001|date=8 January 2017|title=Sorrowfully I received news of sudden demise of my old friend esteemed Hojjat al-Islam wal-Moslemin Sheikh Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.mehrnews.com/news/122580/Leader-pays-tribute-to-old-friend-Hashemi-Rafsanjani&lt;/ref&gt; even though in reality Rafsanjani was of higher clerical rank, as Rafsanjani was an [[Ayatollah]].

According to him, the problem of having political party undertook by common sense and people. In other word [[Islam]] has not definite opinion on parties. [[Islam]] placed the duty of having party on the shoulders of peoples themselves. Islam has not any disagreement with partition. He believes that all parties before [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]] in [[Iran]] controlled by Shah Regime and there was no original party in that time. In fact with victory of Islamic revolution, the existence of part becomes necessary for revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.noormags.ir/view/fa/articlepage/349400/%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B2%D8%A8-%D9%88-%D8%AD%D8%B2%D8%A8-%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D9%86%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%A2%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-(%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%B5%DB%8C-%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B2%D8%A8-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%88?q=%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C%20%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%A8%D8%B1%20%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%85%DB%8C%20%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C&amp;score=1241.0408&amp;rownumber=10|title=polotical party from Ayatollah Rafsanjani|year=2000|pages=271–272|magazine=methodology of oral history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political parties ===
Before Iranian Revolution, Rafsanjani was active in the anti-Shah activities and reportedly associated with the [[Motalefeh|Islamic Coalition]]'s ''shura-ye ruhaniyat'' ({{literal translation|Council of the
Clergy}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Buchta|first1=Wilfried|title= Who rules Iran?: the structure of power in the Islamic Republic|publisher=The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, The Konrad Adenauer Stiftung| place=Washington DC|year=2000|isbn=0-944029-39-6|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|People's Mujahedin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Thomas M.|title=Encyclopedia of the Developing World|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-415-97663-4|page=1343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Rafsanjani was a member of the pragmatic-conservative [[Combatant Clergy Association]], he had a close bond to the [[Executives of Construction Party]] and [[Moderation and Development Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Abbas William Samii|url=https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/e9046128-0224-4587-ad8f-1c4ce204b2cd/Iranian-Nuclear-Issue-and-Informal-Networks,-The--.aspx|title=The Iranian Nuclear Issue and Informal Networks|date=2006|journal=Naval War College Review|access-date=26 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514031713/https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/e9046128-0224-4587-ad8f-1c4ce204b2cd/Iranian-Nuclear-Issue-and-Informal-Networks,-The--.aspx|archive-date=14 May 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Rafsanjani ceased activity in the [[Combatant Clergy Association]], despite remaining a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alef.ir/vdcf0ydmyw6dvta.igiw.html?361521 |script-title=fa:روحانی، بهانه انشعاب جامعه روحانیت؟ |language=Persian |trans-title=Rouhani: Excuse for Split in Combatant Clergy Association? |date=18 June 2016 |work=[[Shargh]] |publisher=Alef |accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Mohammadighalehtaki|first=Ariabarzan|date=2012|title=Organisational Change in Political Parties in Iran after the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

He was regarded as flip-flopping between conservative and reformist camps since the election of [[Mohammad Khatami]], supporting reformers in that election, but going back to the conservative camp in the [[Iranian parliamentary elections, 2000|2000 parliamentary elections]] as a result of the reformist party severely criticizing and refusing to accept him as their candidate. Reformists, including [[Akbar Ganji]], accused him of involvement in murdering dissidents and writers during his presidency. In the end, the major differences between the Kargozaran and the reformists party weakened both and eventually resulted in their loss at [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|the presidential elections in 2005]]. However, Rafsanjani regained close ties with the reformers since he lost the 2005 presidential elections to [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]].&lt;ref name="r"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/story/2006/10/061003_mv-az-rafsanjani-ahmadinejad.shtml Rafsanjani's political life reviewed] — in Persian.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Islamic Republican Party ====
{{Main|Islamic Republican Party}}
Hashemi refers to the point that the [[Islamic Republican Party]] established in the early years of revolution in Iran. [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], at first step, was disagree with establishment of Party because he known the establishment of party as something gradually. But After consultation of Hashemi with Khomeini, the opinion of Khomeini has changed. There were many negotiations and consultations on the instructions of Party .somebodies like [[Yadollah Sahabi]] and [[Habibollah Peyman]] were to communicate but after a while there were no communication with them. Although [[Mortaza Motahhari]] had not any disagreement to establishing party but at the same time he hadn't any communication with party. In fact, the idea of establishment of republic party was necessary in order to give the Mullahs an organization and political collection. The party has established formally on 17 February 1979, namely two weeks after the victory of [[Islamic Revolution]]. The members of the party even determined their members in Kanoon Touhid in early days. The financial expenses of party originated from the voluntary aids of people. At first, religious scholars or clerics took part in the party. In early days there were no financial problem but after a while the problem appeared. Khomeini tried to give financial aid to the party with giving money. The members primarily chose from revolutionary individuals and believed persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.noormags.ir/view/fa/articlepage/349400/%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B2%D8%A8-%D9%88-%D8%AD%D8%B2%D8%A8-%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D9%86%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%A2%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-(%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%B5%DB%8C-%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B2%D8%A8-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%88?q=%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C%20%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%A8%D8%B1%20%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%85%DB%8C%20%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C&amp;score=1241.0408&amp;rownumber=10|title=polotical party from Ayatollah Rafsanjani|year=2000|pages=275–286|magazine=methodology of oral history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assassination attempts ===
[[File:Hashemi Rafsanjani after assassination attempt.jpg|thumb|Rafsanjani speaking with the media after the first assassination attempt]]
Only months after the revolution, Rafsanjani was shot once in the stomach by gunmen&lt;ref&gt;''Hardline Ayatollah Shot in Tehran''. Andrew Whitley. The Financial Times (London, England), Saturday, May 26, 1979; pg. 2; Edition 27,874.&lt;/ref&gt; from one of the groups vying for power amid the political turmoil. He was not seriously wounded—and neither was his wife, who jumped in front to shield him from the attack. "Great men of history do not die," [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]] said in announcing that Rafsanjani had survived.

== Analysis ==
Although he was a close follower of Ayatollah Khomeini and considered as a central elite during Islamic revolution, at the same time he was fan of reconstruction of shattered country after war and according to this fact, he selected his cabinets from western-educated technocrats and social reformers. His cabinet largely was a reformist one. Rafsanjani acquired both the support of Imam Khomeini in one hand and Majlis in other hand. In fact, he tried to transfer the economy towards the free-market system. There was a gap among Rafsanjani and Khatami and reform agenda because of his partnership with those who were conservative. The first face of reformist movements began by Rafsanjani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anoushiravan Enteshami &amp; Mahjoob Zweiri|title=Iran and the rise of Neoconservatives, the politics of Tehran's silent Revolution|year=2007|pages=4–5|publisher=I.B.Tauris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational Activism ==
Born into a wealthy family in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]], Forsyth felt the need to help under-represented people. Specifically, Forsyth was concerned with the problems of poverty and racism. She began her work helping this cause by creating the Anne C. Stauffer Foundation in 1967, which aimed to "promote the integration of southern preparatory schools".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Anne C. Stauffer Foundation largely helped integrate the [[Virginia Episcopal School]] in 1967, Bill Alexander and Marvin Barnard were among the first two to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/years-later-ves-reflects-on-school-s-integration/article_109c3c5a-a58d-11e7-9a8a-83187511e09f.html|title=50 years later, VES reflects on school's integration|last=Smith|first=Alissa|work=NewsAdvance.com|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forsyth rationalized starting the program because of the benefits she believed both black and white students would acquire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aha.confex.com/aha/2013/webprogram/Paper11927.html|title=Paper: Dual Benefits?: Black Students, White Philanthropy, and the Desegregation of Private Southern Prep Schools (127th Annual Meeting (January 3-6, 2013))|website=aha.confex.com|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation over the course of its operation from 1967 to 1975 enable 142 students, mainly African Americans, to attend prep schools in the southern United States.

== Family ==
Anne Cannon Forsyth was the daughter of [[Zachary Smith Reynolds]] and Anne Cannon Stauffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/04556/|title=Anne C.

Forsyth has two sons, Zachary Tate and Jock Tate, both involved in the [[Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
In August 2006, the Anne Cannon Trust was founded in Forsyth's honor, which funded 20 scholarships for students of under-represented groups to attend [[Appalachian State University]]. Forsyth also founded the Awards Committee for Education (ACE), which funded scholarships for high achieving Native American and African American high school students from Appalachia for summer programs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''August Anheuser Busch Sr.''' (December 29, 1865 – February 10, 1934) was an [[United States|American]] brewing magnate who served as the President and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Anheuser-Busch]], based in Saint Louis, Missouri, from 1913 to 1934. It became the world's largest brewery in 1957 under direction of his son [[Gussie Busch|August A. "Gussie" Busch Jr]].&lt;ref name="holian"&gt;[http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=152 Holian, Timothy J. "Adolphus Busch"], In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present,'' vol. 3, edited by Giles R. Hoyt. German Historical Institute. Last modified August 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
August Anheuser Busch was born on December 29, 1865, in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. His father, [[Adolphus Busch]], was the German-born founder of Anheuser-Busch. His mother, Lilly Eberhard Anheuser, was the third daughter of brewer [[Eberhard Anheuser]], who owned the Anheuser Brewery.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; He had eight brothers and five sisters.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/10/11/100651720.pdf |format=pdf |title=Adolphus Busch Dies in Prussia |work= New York Times |date= October 11, 1913 |accessdate=April 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Busch became President of Anheuser-Busch in 1913, shortly after his father's death. Under his leadership, the company survived [[World War I]], [[Prohibition]], and the [[Great Depression]] by innovating and diversifying.

The company delved into the production of corn products, [[baker's yeast]], [[ice cream]], [[soft drink]]s, and commercial [[refrigeration]] units to stay afloat during Prohibition. After Prohibition ended in 1933, many of these operations were discontinued. August also managed to keep Anheuser-Busch prosperous during anti-German bias of World War I. He built the Bevo Mill, about halfway between his mansion on Gravois Road and the Anheuser-Busch brewery downtown.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:August A. Busch Children.jpg|thumb|Photograph of August A. Busch children]]
Busch married Alice Ziesemann on May 8, 1890. Their children were [[Adolphus Busch III|Adolphus III]], Marie, Clara, [[August A. Busch Jr.|August Jr.]], and Alice Busch. The Busches were among prominent families who participated in the [[Veiled Prophet Ball]], and in 1922, Alice Busch was selected as that year's Queen of Love and Beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Thomas M. ''The St. Louis Veiled Prophet Celebration: Power on Parade, 1877–1995,'' U-MO Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Both sons joined the family business. Eldest son [[Adolphus Busch III]] became President and CEO of Anheuser-Busch. After his death in 1946, August Jr. became CEO, building the company into the largest brewery in the world.&lt;ref name="holian"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
In his later life, Busch suffered from [[heart disease]], [[Edema|dropsy]], and [[gout]]. After being severely ill for several months, he committed [[suicide]] at the age of 68 with a gunshot to the abdomen on February 10, 1934, at the Busch Mansion at [[Grant's Farm]].&lt;ref name="todd"&gt;[http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_2efd8b6d-b179-53dc-a6b9-dc9ae1c4e929.html Todd C. Frankel, "For Busch family, woman's death is latest in tragic history" ], ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch,'' December 26, 2010, accessed July 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Before shooting himself, August penned a brief note to his family saying, "Goodbye precious mommie and adorable children."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/a-look-back-shocking-outcome-for-a-busch/article_01648101-f45d-553f-8d85-4fadc616ddbf.html|title=A look back: Shocking outcome for a Busch|last=O'Neil|first=Tim|date=February 14, 2010|website=St. Louis Post Dispatch|publisher=St. Louis Post Dispatch|access-date=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The St. Louis County coroner's jury gathered at the Busch mansion and heard Busch's chauffeur testify to the events of August's suicide. A Dr. P.E. Rutledge of Kirkwood also testified that he had given Busch morphine seven hours before the suicide. The coroner's jury ruled August's death a suicide due to long illness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Thousands of people mourned August at the Busch mansion, including senators and brewers. Busch's lawyer, Daniel N. Kirby said during the service, "As worthy son of a noble father, he was as great a leader in saving the industry as his father had been in creating it."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although his parents are buried in a mausoleum at [[Bellefontaine Cemetery]], August wished to be buried at Sunset Burial Park, near [[Grant's Farm]] in [[St. Louis]]. St. Louis police had to keep crowds away from August's grave.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1947, his widow Alice Busch donated $70,000 to help with the purchase of the [[August A. Busch Memorial Conservation Area]], as a memorial to her husband.&lt;ref name=MDC&gt;{{cite web |title=August A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3224">The '''British Plastics Federation''' ('''BPF''') is the main trade body for the [[plastic]]s industry in the UK.

==History==
It was incorporated on 21 December 1933; the first Chairman was Charles Waghorne of Insulators Limited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/00282883 Companies House]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the longest-established plastics federation in the world.

It was the 1930s that was the decade in which many common plastics were discovered, some in the UK. On 27 March 1933 [[Reginald Gibson]] and [[Eric Fawcett (chemist)|Eric Fawcett]] (with [[Francis Arthur Freeth]] FRS and Sir [[Michael Perrin]]) discovered [[polyethylene]] (polythene) at ICI's [[Winnington Research Laboratory]] at [[Winnington]], [[Cheshire]]; [[John Crawford (chemist)|John Crawford]], at the Explosives group of ICI at [[Ardeer, North Ayrshire]] near [[Stevenston]], produced a commercial synthesis of [[poly(methyl methacrylate)]], also known as Perspex with production beginning in 1934. Polythene is the world's most widespread polymer, and was first produced by ICI from 1939; many plastic bottles are made from [[Low-density polyethylene|LDPE]]. [[Polystyrene]] was invented in Germany in 1937. [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] was discovered in America (New Jersey) in 1938 by [[Roy J. Plunkett]] when at [[DuPont]]. 

[[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] beverage bottles were introduced from 1973. [[Polyether ether ketone|PEEK]] was developed by ICI in 1977. [[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]] water pipes were introduced from 1980. In 1988, a number code for recycling plastics was introduced.

==Structure==
It is headquartered in central London. It houses the UK office of the [[PlasticsEurope]] Europe-wide organisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plasticseurope.org/contact-us.aspx PlasticsEurope]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership===
Companies in the BPF include -
* [[BASF]] UK
* [[Polypipe]]
* [[Rehau Group]] UK
* [[RPC Group]]

==Function==
It represents the UK plastics industry. It runs its '''Plastipedia''', a resource on plastics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpf.co.uk/plastipedia/default.aspx Plastipedia]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 it launched the [[Plastics 2020 Challenge]]. 

===Plastipedia===
'''Plastipedia''' is an online [[encyclopedia]] about [[plastic]]s, starting from their birth in 1862 with the invention of [[Parkesine]]; it is hosted and maintained by the BPF.  It has a comprehensive list of [[plastic]] [[manufacturing process]]s, and lists the 25 main processing technologies, including detailed animations. It also deals with energy management in the plastic industry and offers a guide to the main standards associated with the plastic industry.

{{see also|Double Irish arrangement#Backstop of capital allowances}}
'''Capital allowances''' is the practice of allowing a company to get tax relief on tangible capital expenditure by allowing it to be expensed against its annual pre-tax income.  Generally, the capital allowances will exist for only specified items of tangible capital expenditure, and the expensing is usually spread over a fixed period of years. The term is used in the UK and in Ireland. 

Unusually, the Irish corporate tax system has a [[double Irish arrangement#Backstop of capital allowances|capital allowances for intangible assets]] scheme which allows [[intangible assets]] to be expensed against Irish pre-tax income.  It is a key Irish [[base erosion and profit shifting]] (BEPS) tool that U.S. multinationals use to achieve Irish corporate [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Effective tax rate (ETR)|effective tax rates]] of &lt;3%, and was used by Apple in Ireland in 2015 ([[leprechaun economics]]).  

Capital allowances are in contrast with depreciation, which is not allowed as a deduction for tax purposes, and must be added back to net profit for tax purposes. If capital expenditure does not qualify for a capital allowance, then it means that the business gets no tax relief on such expenditure.

Capital allowances were introduced in the UK in 1946 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-allowances-manual/ca10040|title = HMRC Capital Allowances Manual|date = |accessdate = November 27, 2018 |website = |publisher = HMRC |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be claimed for:

Historically, there have also been capital allowances for industrial and agricultural buildings. These have now been phased out, though an allowance may now be claimed for features integral to a building &lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plant and machinery ==
Of these, by far the most important category is plant and machinery.

Neither term is defined in legislation, though guidance is given by HMRC &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-allowances-manual|title = HMRC Capital Allowances Manual|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This defined machinery as anything that has a moving part. It does not have to be mechanically powered, so a hand operated device qualifies.

The term "plant" is defined in the court case ''Yarmouth v France'' &lt;ref&gt;CA 1887, 19 QBD 647&lt;/ref&gt; which was not a tax case. This held that plant "includes whatever apparatus is used by a businessman for carrying on his business - not his stock in trade, which he buys or makes for sale; but all goods and chattels, fixede or dead, which he keeps for permanent employment in his business". In that case, it was held that his employer's horse was plant.

The scope of exactly what comes within the scope has been the subject of many cases. Among the more important cases, the following have been held to be plant: 
* a shoe maker's knife that lasted for two years, but not one that lasted for less than two years &lt;ref&gt;Hinton v Maden &amp; Ireland. HL [1959] 38 TC 391.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* a large dry dock, which was held to be equipment rather than premises &lt;ref&gt;CIR v Barclay Curle &amp; Co Ltd. HL [1969] 45 TC 221&lt;/ref&gt; 
* swimming pools at a caravan park &lt;ref&gt;Cooke v Beach Station Caravans Ltd. Ch D [1974] 49 TC 514&lt;/ref&gt; 
* artificial football pitch, held not to be part of the premises &lt;ref&gt;CIR v Anchor International Ltd. CS [2004] 77 TC 38&lt;/ref&gt; 
* grain silos &lt;ref&gt;Schofield v R &amp; H Hall Ltd. CA(NI) [1974] 49 TC 538&lt;/ref&gt; 
* law books owned by a barrister &lt;ref&gt;Munby v Furlong. CA. [1977] 50 TC 491&lt;/ref&gt; 
* gazebo for smokers in the garden of a pub &lt;ref&gt;Mrs C A Andrews v HMRC. FTT [2010] TC 799&lt;/ref&gt; 
* decorative screens in the window of building society branches.&lt;ref&gt;Leeds Permanent Building Society v Proctor. Ch D [1982] 56 TC 293&lt;/ref&gt; 
Where a capital allowances claim has been made on a property a new purchaser can only make another claim valuing the plant and machinery at the same rate as claimed previously. Further claims can be made on a property where it is extended or re-developed but only on those new elements of plant and machinery introduced to the building.

The amount of the allowance depends on what is claimed for. In some cases, the rates are different in the year a business entity made the purchase from those in subsequent years.

A business operator cannot claim capital allowances for things bought or sold: these are claimed as business expenses. If a business asset is bought on a [[hire purchase]] basis, the original cost of the item can be claimed as a capital allowance, but the interest and other charges count as business expenses.

== Types of allowance ==
The main types of capital allowance are:
* annual investment allowance (AIA) introduced from 1 April 2008 &lt;ref&gt;Capital Allowances Act 2001 s38A&lt;/ref&gt;
* first year allowance (FYA)
* writing down allowance (WDA).
* balancing allowance (BA).
AIA is claimed for plant and machinery, with some exceptions such as for cars. It is fixed amount regardless of the size of the business and so is worth proportionately more for smaller businesses. The amount has varied many times since its introduction. In the 2015 summer Budget it was announced that it would be fixed at £200,000 until 2020.

FYA may be claimed in the tax year in which the asset was acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Capital Allowances Act 2001 s52&lt;/ref&gt; It has largely been replaced by AIA. It may still be claimed for certain energy-saving products.

WDA applies to such amounts of allowable expenditure that are not relieved by either AIA or FYA. Broadly it requires all assets to be put into either a general pool, a special pool or a single-asset pool. Assets in the general pool are written down at 18% while those in the special pool are written down at 8%. An asset in a single-asset pool is written down at either 8% or 18% depending on its nature. The advantage is that, on disposal, the whole of the written down value may be offset against taxable profits. The whole balance of a pool may be written off if it falls below £1,000.

BA applies when a business ceases.

==Technical considerations==

Capital allowance reliefs can be set against the client’s taxable profits reducing the amount payable. Companies pay [[Corporation Tax]] at 19% (2018 figure&lt;ref&gt;HMRC website https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-corporation-tax/rates-and-allowances-corporation-tax&lt;/ref&gt;), whilst individuals pay tax at 20%, 40% or 45%. Please note as it is an allowance against taxable profit, you have to be a tax payer to benefit, therefore this does not normally apply to property owned in SIPPS or by charities and trusts. 
Allowances are generated when a business client builds or acquires commercial property. The amount of plant contained within the building or acquired property is the key to maximising the relief.

The claim should be considered as an effective discount and cash contribution to the construction cost or purchase price. The claim provides a tax saving that accrues over time. It is possible to claim allowances on investment properties but plant let in a "dwelling house" is excluded. Blocks of flats, halls of residence etc. will therefore qualify.

For property that is being acquired, the specialist can apportion the purchase price under a recognised HMRC formula, and this is where the inherent property skill can maximise the claim with optimal costing of the plant contained within the property

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8764">'''Chemical plant cost indexes''' are [[dimensionless number]]s employed to updating [[capital cost]] required to erect a [[chemical plant]] from a past date to a later time, following changes in the value of money due to [[inflation]] and deflation.  Since, at any given time, the number of chemical plants is insufficient to use in a preliminary or predesign estimate, cost indexes are handy for a series of management purposes, like long-range planning, budgeting and escalating or de-escalating contract costs.&lt;ref&gt;Pintelon, L. &amp; Puyvelde, F. V., 1997. Estimating Plant Construction Costs. Chemical Engineering, August, pp. 98-104&lt;/ref&gt;

A cost index is the ratio of the actual price in a time period compared to that in a selected base period (a defined point in time or the average price in a certain year), multiplied by 100.  Raw materials, products and energy prices, labor and construction costs change at different rates, and plant construction cost indexes are actually a composite, able to compare generic chemical plants capital costs.

==Calculations methods==

Although the available indexes are compiled in several ways, they are defined to encompass a specific set of conditions and items.  Prices for these items can be obtained either through company’s purchasing department data or through published indexes, like those published by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS).&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, K. K., 2005. Project and Cost Engineers' Handbook. 4th ed. s.l.:Marcel Dekker&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the CE and the IC indexes, from Chemical Engineering and Intratec, respectively, employs BLS’ data.

The weighting of such factors, which is defined by the realized degree of importance of each component in the specific index (or sub-index), aims to represent the costs variations typically found for chemical plants.

==Using a cost index==

To update an item cost (equipment, projects) from period A to period B, is necessary to multiply period A’s cost by the ratio of period B’s index over period A’s index, according to the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;\text{Cost at B} = \text{Cost at A}\cdot \frac{\text{index at B }}{\text{index at A }}&lt;/math&gt;

As a rule-of-thumb, cost indexes permit fairly accurate estimates for cost escalation if the difference between period A and period B is less than 10 years.  Differences between the actual equipment and labor prices and those predicted by the index tend to grow over the years, surpassing the typical error verified in budget-level estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, M., Timmerhaus, K. &amp; West, R., 2004. Plant Design and Economics for Chemical Engineers. 5th ed. s.l.:McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vatavuk, W. M., 2002. Updating the CE Plant Cost Index. Chemical Engineering, January, pp. 62-70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost indexes in engineering==

The selection of the proper index to use depends on the industry in which it is applied.  For example, while CE, M&amp;S or IC Index are typically employed for chemical process industries, the ENR ([[Engineering News-Record]]) construction index is used for general industrial construction and takes in account the prices for fixed amounts of structural steel, cement, lumber and labor.

The majority of cost indexes demonstrate a time lag, due to data collection and its compilation for publishing.  As stated before, some indexes use information published by other organizations and a delay in data may be verified (like those provide by the BLS).  Exceptions to this are the ENR construction and the IC indexes, which present relatively current values.

The main indexes available for process industries include:

* '''Chemical Engineering Index, CE''':  composed of 4 major components – equipment, construction labor, buildings, and engineering and supervision – the index is employed primary as a process plant construction index, was established using a base period of 1957-1959 as 100. The CE Index is updated monthly and it lags in time by about 3 months.  The CE Index was revised in 1982, to account for changes in labor productivity and, again, in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Couper, J. R., 2003. Process Engineering Economics. s.l.:Marcel Dekker&lt;/ref&gt; Published in each issue of Chemical Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Albright, L.. 2008. Albright's Chemical Engineering Handbook. s.l.:CRC-Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chemengonline.com/pci/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Marshall and Swift Cost Index, M&amp;S''' (originally known as Marshall and Stevens Index):  a composite of two major components - process-industry equipment average and all-industry equipment average - was established in 1926 with a value of 100.  Some industries considered in the process-industry equipment average are chemicals, petroleum products, rubber and paper.  The all-industry average encompasses 47 different types of industrial, commercial and housing equipment.  Published monthly in each issue of Chemical Engineering until April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.equipment-cost-index.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Intratec Chemical Plant Construction Index, IC''':  a process plant construction index developed by Intratec, a chemical consulting company.  Although cost indexes do not usually forecast future escalation, the IC Index stands out for presenting a smaller delay between release date and index date, besides a 12 months forecast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slideshare.net/intratec/intratec-chemical-plant-construction-index |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929012909/http://www.slideshare.net/intratec/intratec-chemical-plant-construction-index |archivedate=2012-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the index is only available from January 2000 (with a value of 100).  A sample is available at Intratec’s website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intratec.us/ic&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nelson-Farrar Indexes, NF''' (originally known as the Nelson Refinery Construction Indexes):  established in 1946 with a value of 100, the index is more suitable for petroleum or petrochemical business.  Published once a month in the Oil and Gas Journal.

==Cost Indexes for different locations==
The standard indexes available are usually restricted to a particular region, as in the case of '''NF Index''', which is accurate only to the region of the US Gulf coast (USGC). Likewise most of the data available for plant and equipment costs are mostly either in
# '''US Gulf Coast Basis (USGC)'''
# '''Northwest Europe Basis (NWE)''' 
Hence the Index values cannot be used to get accurate results in other regions of the world. This variation might be due various factors such as 
* Cost and availability of materials
* Cost and availability of labor
* Cost of transportation of equipment and labor
* Import duties and local taxes
* Currency exchange rates
Of all these factors currency exchange rates is said to have the greatest impact in the variation of results.

Cost indexes for international locations is published in ''"Process Engineering"'' journal as well as in the ''"International Journal of Production Economics"'' (formerly ''"Engineering Costs and Production Economics"''). As of 2012 "''Process Engineering"'' has not been publishing new indexes viewable by full access from EbscoHost.  They mentioned in May/June 2012 that their analyst had fallen sick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plant Cost Indices|last = |first = |date = May 2012|journal = Process Engineering|doi = |pmid = |volume = 93|issue = 3|page = 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location Factor==
In order to be able to use the available standard indexes to locations where index data is not available we have to incorporate a new term called the '''Location Factor (LF) '''to the standard index value. It is a dimensionless value for a particular location relative to either of the above-mentioned basis.

'''''Cost in A = Cost in USGC x LF(A)'''''

where '''A''' is the location for which cost is being evaluated and '''LF(A)''' is the location factor for the location A relative to USGC

Location factors are greatly influenced by currency exchange rates due to their significant effect on Index value and hence vary drastically with time. Over the past couple of decades the location factors for various locations are trending close to the value 1. However location factor for a particular region within a country can be easily determined by adding 10% to the index of the reference location for every 1000 miles. The reference location is usually a major industrial location closest to the location where the index is being determined. Location factors for various locations have been published and updated in various journals as in Aspen Richardson's ''"International Construction Cost Factor Location Manual (2003)".''

'''Cubist Pharmaceuticals''' was a U.S. [[biopharmaceutical]] company with activities spanning from research and development to commercialization of pharmaceutical products. Its main products target pathogens like [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]].

Cubist was one of the few firms that continued to research in antibiotics while larger pharmaceutical companies have abandoned such research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/cubist-exec-challenges-mount-antibiotics-discovery/2014-08-26| title= Cubist exec: Challenges mount in antibiotics discovery| last= Mullin| first=Emily| date=26 Aug 2014| accessdate= 23 Nov 2014| website= Fiercebiotechresearch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company employs 638 people, with 370 in their headquarters in Lexington, MA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc. homesite | work=2009 Annual Report|url=http://www.snl.com/irweblinkx/file.aspx?FID=1500026840&amp;IID=4093793 |accessdate=20 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2011, the company’s headquarters are under expansion and is expected to occupy {{convert|373,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} in Lexington, MA. On 8 December 2014, [[Merck &amp; Co.]] acquired Cubist for $102 per share in cash ($8.4 billion) as entree to the market for drugs that can combat [[super bug (bacteria)|superbugs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/09/us-cubist-pharma-m-a-merck-idUSKBN0JM19X20141209 Merck to take on superbugs with Cubist Pharma buy]. [[Reuters]], 9 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cubist was founded in May 1992 by John K. Clarke, [[Paul Schimmel|Paul R. Schimmel, Ph.D.]] and [[Barry Bloom]], Ph.D, all of whom were also directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SEC Form S3 Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | date=March 8, 2000 | url=http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/spos/filing.ashx?filingid=1123315}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cubist appeared on Fortune 2010’s List of fastest growing companies, and was named to the 2010 Deloitte Technology Fast 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortunefastestgrowing/2010/|title=100 FASTEST-GROWING COMPANIES|date=2010|accessdate=28 May 2011|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006 it had the [[List of biotechnology companies|19th highest sales]] among American based biotechnology companies.

In 2011, the company acquired Adolor, maker of a drug for treatment of [[constipation]].&lt;ref name=apcubist2012/&gt;

Cubist had an ambitious growth plan laid out for the 2012-2017 quinquennium. Under this plan, the company was expected to reach 2B dollars in sales and have 4 new drugs in late stage development by 2017. As a part of this plan, sales of its flagship drug Cubicin were expected to grow to more than 1B dollars per year.

In July 2013, Cubist Pharmaceuticals agreed to purchase [[Trius Therapeutics]] and [[Optimer Pharmaceuticals]] for around $1.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/31/us-cubist-deal-idUSBRE96T1BI20130731| title= Cubist to pay up to $1.6 billion for two antibiotics makers | author= Vrinda Manocha and Zeba Siddiqui | publisher=Reuters | date=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, succeeding [[Michael Bonney]] as President, Robert J. Perez, was announced to take leadership on January 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/10/20/new-cubist-pharmaceuticals-chief-executive-will-robert-perez/wf8FbqJsIQSS4HxQQmCzVM/story.html| title=New Cubist Pharmaceuticals chief executive will be Robert J. Perez | date= 20 Oct 2014| accessdate= 23 Nov 2014| last=Weisman| first=Robert| website=www.BostonGlobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015 Cubist Pharmaceuticals became a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co.

==Products==
The company markets Cubicin ([[daptomycin]]) for injection, the first antibiotic in a class of anti-infectives called [[lipopeptides]].  In 2011, Cubist settled a patent litigation with [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries]] regarding Cubicin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-04/cubist-licenses-cubicin-antibiotic-to-teva-in-patent-suit-settlement.html|title=Cubist Settles Teva Patent Litigation on Antibiotic Cubicin|date=2011-04-05|accessdate=28 May 2011|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 2011 it reached a deal with Optimer Pharmaceuticals in which its class of bacterium fighting drugs will be co marketed with Optimer's Fidaxomicin/Dificid (for $15 million per year).  Optimer chose Cubist because according to its CEO, "Cubist has a proven track record and well established relations with all stakeholders involved in the antibiotics space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-06/optimer-to-co-market-dificid-drug-with-cubist-pharmaceuticals.html|title=Optimer to Market Dificid Drug With Cubist Pharmaceuticals|date=2011-04-06 | work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7179">The '''European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises''' or '''UEAPME''' is an [[Employers' organization|umbrella group for associations]] of [[Small and medium enterprise|SMEs]] based in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. UEAPME represents the interests of European crafts, trades and SMEs at [[European Union|EU]] level. Its 67 member organisations from 34 European countries consist of national cross-sectorial SME federations, European branch federations and other associate members. Its members combined represent more than 12 million enterprises, which employ around 50 million [[people]] across [[Europe]]. UEAPME is a recognised [[Social partners|European Social Partner]].

==History==

UEAPME was founded in 1980. The first headquarters of the association were in [[Munich]], [[Germany]]. After some years in Germany, the organisation moved its headquarters to [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], where it was established in 1991 as an international not for profit association under Belgian law ([[AISBL]]). The acronym UEAPME was made official in this incorporation and stands for “Union Européenne de l’Artisanat et des Petites et Moyennes Enterprises”, i.e. the European Union of Crafts and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises.

The aims of UEAPME as written in its statutes&lt;ref name="statutes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/tsv_pdf/2004/10/08/04142048.pdf |title=UEAPME statutes on the Belgian Ministry of Justice website (PDF) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; are as follows:

* Monitoring the EU policy and legislative process and keeping its members informed on all matters of European Union policy of relevance to crafts, trades and SMEs;
* Representing and promoting the interests, needs and opinions of its member organisations to the EU institutions and other international organisations;
* Supporting its members academically, technically and legally on all areas of EU policy;
* Supporting the idea of European integration and contributing to European co-operation.

As of 1998, UEAPME is a European Social Partner alongside [[BUSINESSEUROPE]] (previously UNICE), the [[European Centre of Enterprises with Public Participation and of Enterprises of General Economic Interest]] (CEEP) and the [[European Trade Union Confederation]] (ETUC). In 1996, the first negotiations between UNICE, CEEP and ETUC led to the conclusion of a framework agreement on parental leave. UEAPME challenged the validity of the directive implementing the agreement before the [[European Court of First Instance]], claiming a violation of its own right to negotiate. The complaint was dismissed in June 1998,&lt;ref name="court"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996A0135:EN:HTML |title=Union Européenne de l’Artisanat et des Petites et Moyennes Entreprises (UEAPME) v. Council of the European Union, Case T-135/96 (1998) |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the court case created political momentum for the opening of discussions with UNICE, according to the principle of mutual recognition. In November of the same year, the two organisations reached an agreement, further to which UEAPME became a recognised participant in the European social dialogue.

==Structure==

UEAPME is run by a Secretariat based in Brussels consisting of 20 staff members working in thematic directorates. The Secretariat also includes an administrative section, a press office and a Study Unit.  The current President is [[Ulrike Rabmer-Koller]], from Austria, since January 2016.

The UEAPME structure also includes a Board of Directors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ueapme.com/spip.php?rubrique8 |title=Board of Directors |publisher=UEAPME |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as several Committees, Working Groups and Task Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ueapme.com/spip.php?rubrique9 |title=Committees, Working Groups and Task Forces |publisher=UEAPME |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cleveland Fed map.gif|thumb|Map of the Fourth District]]
The '''Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland''' is the [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]-based headquarters of the U.S. [[Federal Reserve System]]'s Fourth [[Federal Reserve Districts|District]]. The district is composed of [[Ohio]], western [[Pennsylvania]], eastern [[Kentucky]], and the [[Northern Panhandle of West Virginia|northern panhandle]] of [[West Virginia]]. It has branch offices in [[Cincinnati]] and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. The check processing center in [[Columbus, Ohio]], was closed in 2005. The [[chief executive officer]] and [[president (corporate title)|president]] is [[Loretta Mester]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/banks/pres04.htm Loretta J. Mester] at federalreserve.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank building is a 13-story 203 foot [[high-rise]], located at Superior Avenue and East 6th Street in [[downtown Cleveland]] was designed by the Cleveland firm of [[Walker and Weeks]] and completed in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/complex/106064/federal-reserve-bank-of-cleveland-cleveland-oh-usa|title=Federal Reserve Bank Building}} Retrieved on 2015-10-16&lt;/ref&gt; Its exterior architecture emulates an [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] [[palazzo]], is clad in pink Sienna [[marble]]. An extension to the building designed by [[Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum|HOK]] was completed in 1998, providing new facilities for check processing and cash handling. The building is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].
The building's entrances feature [[allegorical sculpture]]s by [[Henry Hering]] representing ''Security'' and ''Integrity'' flanking the East Sixth Street entrance, while his ''Energy'' watches the Superior Avenue entry.

Its original {{convert|100|ST|t}} [[bank vault]] door is the largest in the world. The door casting itself was {{convert|20|ST|t}}.{{Citation needed|reason=Can't find a source for this last number|date=December 2009}} It incorporates the largest hinge ever built. The hinge has an overall height of {{convert|19|ft|m}} and weighs over {{convert|47|ST|t}} fully assembled. The vault's use was discontinued in 1997, though it is preserved intact for posterity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/Tours/About_the_Cleveland_Fed/Photo_Tour/photo_tour_thirteen.cfm|title=Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland historical photo tour|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland|accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning Center and Money Museum==

'''Forrest Edward Mars Sr.''' (March 21, 1904 – July 1, 1999) was an American [[Businessperson|businessman]] and the driving force of the [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars candy empire]]. He is best known for introducing [[Milky Way (chocolate bar)|Milky Way]] (1923) and [[Mars (chocolate bar)|Mars]] (1932) chocolate [[Candy bar|candy bars]], and [[M&amp;M's]] (1941) chocolate candy, as well as orchestrating the launch of [[Uncle Ben's Rice]]. He was the son of candy company [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars, Inc.]] founder [[Franklin Clarence Mars|Frank C. Mars]] and his first wife Ethel G. Mars ([[née]] Kissack).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/encyclopaedia!openframeset&amp;frame=Right&amp;Src=/edible.nsf/pages/marsfamily!opendocument |title= Mars Family |work= Practically Edible |accessdate= February 25, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090504211100/http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/encyclopaedia%21openframeset%26frame%3DRight%26Src%3D/edible.nsf/pages/marsfamily%21opendocument |archivedate= May 4, 2009 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Mars was born in [[Wadena, Minnesota]], and raised in [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]] after his parents' divorce when he was just a child. He rarely saw his father. After high school he entered the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and later transferred to [[Yale University]], where he completed a degree in [[industrial engineering]] in 1928.&lt;ref name="web.mit.edu"&gt;http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/mars.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As an adult, Forrest Mars reunited with his father at Mars, Inc. However, the pair ran into a disagreement when Forrest wanted to expand abroad while his father did not. Mars then took a buyout from his father and moved to [[England]] where he created the [[Mars (chocolate bar)|Mars bar]] and [[Maltesers]] while estranged from his father in 1933. In Europe, Mars briefly worked for [[Nestlé]] and [[Toblerone|the Tobler company]].&lt;ref name="web.mit.edu"/&gt;

In 1934, he bought a British company, Chappel Bros, specialized in [[Potted meat|canned meat]] for dogs. Due to the lack of competition, Forrest took control of this market as he launched and marketed Chappie's canned food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=pwHJCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=Frank+mars+created+snickers+bars+in+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD_bSNoNLWAhXCrRoKHRY6BxsQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Frank%20mars%20created%20snickers%20bars%20in%201930&amp;f=false|title=Corporate Cultures and Global Brands|last=Rothacher|first=Albrecht|date=2004-10-25|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789814482585|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After he returned to the United States, Mars started his own food business, [[Food Products Manufacturing]], where he established the [[Uncle Ben's Rice]] line and a pet food 
business, [[Pedigree Petfoods|Pedigree]]. In partnership later with Bruce Murrie, Mars developed [[M&amp;M's]], the [[chocolate]] candy covered in a crunchy shell which "melts in your mouth, not in your hands," in 1940. They were modeled after a candy that he had discovered while in [[Spain]] during the 1930s. It is believed that he got the idea when he saw soldiers eating a similar candy during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name="web.mit.edu" /&gt; [[Peanut]] M&amp;M's were introduced in 1954 although Forrest had been allergic to peanuts his entire life. Murrie later left the business.

Following the death of his father, Forrest Mars took over the family business, Mars, Inc, merging it with his own company in 1964.&lt;ref name="web.mit.edu"/&gt;  
He was married to Audrey Ruth Meyer (b. May 25, 1910, in Chicago, d. June 15, 1989, in Washington, D.C.), and they had four children – [[Forrest Mars Jr.|Forrest Jr.]], [[John Franklyn Mars|John]], Janet, and [[Jacqueline Mars|Jacqueline]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Mars retired from Mars, Inc. in 1973, turning the company over to his children.&lt;ref name="Brenner 1992" /&gt;

In 1980, retired and living in [[Henderson, Nevada]], he founded [[Ethel M Chocolates]], named after his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ethelm.com/about_us/default.aspx |title= About Us |publisher= Ethel M Chocolates |accessdate = February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethel M was purchased by Mars, Inc. in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Allen |first=Lawrence |title=Chocolate Fortunes |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mars died at age 95 in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], having amassed a fortune of $4 billion. He was ranked as 30th in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine's list of richest [[United States|Americans]] (Forrest Jr. and John were 29th and 31st, respectively). He left the business jointly to his three children.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Mars was inducted into the [[Junior Achievement]] U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1984.

&lt;/ref&gt; Police said Zinkhan and his wife, Marie Bruce, were having “marital difficulties,” that Tom Tanner appeared to be his “specific target” in the shootings and that Ben Teague was “at the wrong place at the wrong time.” Tanner was shot first, police said.&lt;ref name="pallet"&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/services/content/metro/stories/2009/05/12/zinkhan_grave.html Athens killer lay in grave under pallet, shot himself], [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]], May 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, "Zinkhan was charged with three counts of murder and a state [[arrest warrant]] was issued in Clarke County, Georgia.

==Death==

Miles, Chip Towers; "[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]", May 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
Investigators said that Zinkhan used a shovel to dig a {{convert|15|to|18|in|mm|adj=mid|-deep}} grave in the woods behind [[Clarke County School District|Cleveland Road Elementary]], lay down in it, took an old wooden pallet he had covered with dirt and debris and pulled it over top of the hole.&lt;ref name="The Augusta Chronicle"&gt;[http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/latest/lat_519041.shtml "Police say Zinkhan targeted Tanner, committed suicide"], by Allison Floyd; [[The Augusta Chronicle]]", May 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He then fired a single shot from a .38-caliber handgun into his head.&lt;ref name="pallet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ajc" /&gt;

Zinkhan's body was claimed by a son from a previous marriage one day before it was scheduled for burial in a pauper's grave by the Athens-Clarke County coroner's office.&lt;ref name="burial"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/05/15/zinkhan.body/index.html Son claims body of professor accused in killings], [[CNN]], May 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Handelsgesetzbuch''' ('''HGB''', in English ''Commercial Code'') contains the core of the commercial law in Germany. It regulates the legal relations of merchants and therefore it is also designated as "the special private law for merchants".  

The [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB)]] (English ''Civil Code'') is only subsidiary applied to merchants beside the HGB. 
Beside that the HGB contains the regulations for the Offene Handelsgesellschaft (OHG) (English ''General partnership''), the Kommanditgesellschaft (KG) (English ''Limited partnership'') and the Stille Gesellschaft (stG) (English ''Dormant partnership'').

HGB provides regulation to accounting for limited companies.

HGB also has a few penal provisions.

== History ==
Precursor of the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB) was the [[Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch|Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch (ADHGB)]] of 1861. ADHGB was replaced in the [[German Empire]] by the HGB, that was legislated on 10 May 1897. The HGB came into force together with the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB)]] on 1 January 1900.

== Content ==
HGB also contains in the fifth Book the Maritime Trade Law (Seehandelsrecht).
The HGB is arranged as follows 

(table of contents): 
# Book: Merchant class (German ''Handelsstand'')  (§§ 1–104a)
## Merchants (German ''Kaufleute'')
## Commercial register (German ''Handelsregister'')
## Firm (German ''Handelsfirma'')
## annulled
## [[Procuration]] and commercial power of attorney (German ''Prokura und Handlungsvollmacht'')
## Merchant assistants and apprentices (German ''Handlungsgehilfen und Handlungslehrlinge'')
## Commercial agent (German ''Handelsvertreter'')
## Commercial brokers (German ''Handelsmakler'')
## Fines (German ''Bußgeldvorschiften'')
# Book: Commercial partnership and dormant partnership (§§ 105–237)
## General partnership (German ''Offene Handelsgesellschaft'')
## Limited partnership (German ''Kommandtitgesellschaft'')
## Dormant partnership (German ''Stille Gesellschaft'')
# Book: Trading books (German ''Handelsbücher'')(§§ 238–342e)
## Provisions for all merchants (German ''Vorschriften für alle Kaufleute'')

'''Henry Osborne Havemeyer''' (October 18, 1847 – December 4, 1907) was an American industrialist, entrepreneur and sugar refiner who founded and became president of the [[American Sugar Refining Company]] in 1891.

Havemeyer was the third generation of his family in the sugar business and oversaw the expansion of the family firm into the American Sugar Refining Company which dominated the sugar industry in the late 19th century. Together with his wife, [[Louisine Havemeyer]], he was an avid and prolific collector of art, one of the earliest collectors to bring [[Impressionism|Impressionist Art]] to America, guided by artist [[Mary Cassatt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdm16028.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/search/searchterm/Havemeyer%20Family%20Papers%20relating%20to%20Art%20Collecting,%201901-1922/field/relatig/mode/exact/order/descri Correspondence, 1901-1920, Boxes 1-3, The Havemeyer Family Papers relating to Art Collecting, The Metropolitan Museum of Art.]&lt;/ref&gt; After Louisine Havemeyer's death in 1929, a large part of their collection was bequeathed to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

== Early life ==
Henry Osborne Havemeyer was born in [[New York City]] on October 18, 1847, the eighth of nine children, to Frederick Christian Havemeyer Jr. (1807-1891), and Sarah Louise Henderson Havemeyer (1812-1851). His mother died in 1851 when Harry, as he was known to his family, was three years old. He was raised with the help of his grandmothers, Mary Osborne Henderson and Catharine Billiger Havemeyer, and his oldest sister, Mary Havemeyer. The family lived in a house at 193 West 14th Street,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trow's New York City Directory, 1854/1855|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hnfij4;view=1up;seq=331|accessdate=24 September 2016}} Note: 14th Street was renumbered in 1869.&lt;/ref&gt; in what was then the northern frontier of New York City. In 1854, Harry Havemeyer, age seven, and his brother Thomas, age nine, were sent to study at the [[Bellport Academy]] in [[Long Island]], under the charge of Mr. James Cruikshank. The following year, Harry followed his older brother Theodore to [[Mr. Betts' School]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut]]. He was a difficult, short-tempered student. After a fight with the principal, he left the school. His formal schooling ended at the age of eight.{{sfnp|Havemeyer|2010|p=5-7, 17}}

== Sugar refining ==

=== Havemeyers in the sugar industry (1799–1842) ===
In 1799, William Havemeyer (1770-1851) arrived in New York City, followed three years later by his younger brother Frederick Christian Havemeyer (1774-1841). The brothers came from a family of bakers in Bückeburg, Germany, and trained in London during the last decades of the 18th century. William Havemeyer was brought to New York under contract to Edmund Seaman to run his sugar bakery on Pine Street. Frederick followed circa 1802, and in 1805 the brothers leased land from [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] on Budd Street (later renamed Vandam Street) to build their own sugar bakery, which opened in 1807. After the Havemeyer brothers retired in 1828, their respective sons, cousins [[William F. Havemeyer]] (1804-1874) and Frederick C. Havemeyer Jr. (1807-1891), took over the [[Havemeyer family]] business. In 1842 William F. Havemeyer began a political career, serving three terms as [[List of mayors of New York City|Mayor of New York City]]. In 1856 Frederick C. Havemeyer Jr. moved the business to [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]] leasing a waterfront lot between South 3rd and South 4th Streets on which to establish a steam sugar refinery.{{sfnp|Havemeyer II|1944|p=26-28}} In 1861 eldest son George W. Havemeyer, age 22, became partner, but died on November 27, 1861, when his clothes were caught in the crank of one of the refinery's large engines.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1861/11/28/news/sad-death-of-a-son-of-ex-mayor-havemeyer.html Sad Death of a Son of ex-Mayor Havemeyer]" New York Times, November 28, 1861. (Errata: the ex-Mayor, William F. Havemeyer, was not his father. His father was Frederick C. Havemeyer, Jr.)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863 Frederick C. Havemeyer Jr. reorganized the business as Havemeyers &amp; Elder, a partnership with son [[Theodore A. Havemeyer]] in charge of refinery operations and son-in-law J. Lawrence Elder in charge of the mercantile business.{{sfnp|Havemeyer II|1944|p=47}}

=== Havemeyers &amp; Elder (1863–1882) ===
When the partnership of Havemeyers &amp; Elder was formed in 1863, Henry Osborne Havemeyer, known in the business as H.O. Havemeyer, was a fifteen-year-old apprentice and, in the family tradition, was learning his way through all aspects of the business from testing sugar at the docks to learning the complex processes of refinery operations, including the carefully guarded secrets of sugar boiling.{{sfnp|Catlin Jr.|1988|p=6, 13}} Subsequently, he became apprentice to J. Lawrence Elder, working on the mercantile aspect of the business—purchasing, sales and record keeping. When Elder died suddenly in 1868, H.O. Havemeyer and his brother Thomas took over the mercantile business and became partners in Havemeyers &amp; Elder in 1869. Cousin Charles H. Senff also joined the partnership to manage refinery operations and construction with Theodore A. Havemeyer.{{sfnp|Havemeyer II|1944|p=67}} By 1868 the Havemeyers &amp; Elder refinery had doubled in size. Known as the Yellow Sugar House,&lt;ref&gt;Barta, George L. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fhk9AAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=George%20Barta%20%22Old%20Yellow%20Sugar%20House%22&amp;pg=PT85 Old Sugar Days in Brooklyn: Reminiscences]" ''The American Sugar Family'', Vols. 1-2, 1920, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; it covered the blocks on the [[East River]] waterfront from South 2nd Street to South 5th Street. Modern innovations were introduced into refinery operations, such that sugar was refined with great efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Havemeyer, Harry W. ''Merchants of Williamsburgh''. New York: privately printed, 1989, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1876 Thomas Havemeyer was no longer involved in Havemeyers &amp; Elder, and H.O. Havemeyer became the principal partner in charge of the mercantile business.

=== Refinery fire and rebuilding (1882–1884) ===
On Sunday, January 8, 1882, the Havemeyers &amp; Elder refinery was completely destroyed by fire, a loss of $1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://eagle.brooklynpubliclibrary.org/Repository/getimage.dll?path=BEG/1882/01/09/4/Img/Pg004.png A Great Fire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211151913/http://eagle.brooklynpubliclibrary.org/Repository/getimage.dll?path=BEG%2F1882%2F01%2F09%2F4%2FImg%2FPg004.png |date=2013-12-11 }}" Brooklyn Daily Eagle, January 9, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; The partners, Theodore, H. O. and Frederick C. Havemeyer Jr. and cousin Charles H. Senff, agreed to rebuild and constructed a large state-of-the-art refinery, the cost of which required the entire financial resources of the family, including Frederick C. Havemeyer Jr.'s personal fortune.{{sfnp|Catlin Jr.|1988|p=6}} The new refinery was designed by Theodore A. Havemeyer, Charles H. Senff and refinery superintendent Ernest Gerbracht. It was built of completely fireproof materials—brick and iron, with cast iron columns and wrought iron beams and girders. Electric lights were installed, a new technology that was less hazardous than gas lights.&lt;ref&gt;Landmarks Preservation Commission, [http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/domino.pdf Havemeyers &amp; Elder Filter, Pan &amp; Finishing House], September 25, 2007. (Link to pdf.)&lt;/ref&gt; The refinery reopened for business in January 1884 with a capacity to refine three million pounds of sugar daily.{{sfnp|Havemeyer|2010|p=41}}

=== Formation of the Sugar Trust (1887–1891) ===
In 1887 H.O. Havemeyer established the Sugar Refineries Company, known as the [[Sugar Trust]]. The late 1870s and 1880s were a time of intense competition in sugar refining, in which the growth of the industry after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] led to overproduction and slim profit margins. Large refineries, such as Havemeyers &amp; Elder, were producing sugar so efficiently and at such great quantity that supply outstripped demand. Refineries were unable to operate at full capacity and many smaller, less efficient refineries failed. In the face of these harsh conditions, the sugar refiners sought to organize in order to control production and pricing. On October 27, 1887, after two years of negotiations, an agreement was reached to combine into a "[[Trust (monopoly)|trust]]," called the Sugar Refineries Company.
{{sfnp|Vogt|1908|p=34-36}} By year end the Sugar Trust included 17 of the 23 refinery companies operating in the United States. A competition between the company's refineries followed to determine which were most efficient and would remain in operation. By 1890 five refineries remained in operation, with Havemeyers &amp; Elder as the sole New York area refinery.{{sfnp|Havemeyer II|1944|p=68}}

The legality of the Sugar Trust came before the New York State court in a November 1890 suit, ''People of the State of New York versus the North River Refining Company''.
{{sfnp|Vogt|1908|p=42-43}} This led the Sugar Trust to reorganize as a holding company, the American Sugar Refining Company, which was incorporated in [[New Jersey]] on January 10, 1891, by attorneys [[Elihu Root]] and John Randolph Dos Passos. Effectively the business practices of the American Sugar Refining Company maintained those of the Sugar Refineries Company and it continued to be known as the Sugar Trust.

=== Acquisition of refineries (1887–1895) ===
In 1887 Havemeyer sought to bring the remaining independent refineries into the Trust. His chief rival on the West Coast was [[Claus Spreckels]], who refused to join the Trust. Using a small California plant that the Sugar Trust had acquired in 1891, Havemeyer began an aggressive price war to put Spreckels out of business. In retaliation Spreckels opened a [[Philadelphia]] refinery in 1889, intending to undercut the Trust’s business in the East.{{sfnp|Catlin Jr.|1988|p=25}} A fierce price war continued for two years, until the Trust and Spreckels came to an agreement in 1891: Spreckels sold his Philadelphia refinery to the Trust and the two sides agreed to keep out of each other’s territory.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1891/03/31/106048784.pdf Sugar Trust War Ended]," New York Times, March 31, 1891. Link to pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The years 1889-1892 were a severely competitive time for the Trust, where the margin between the cost of raw sugar and the price of refined sugar was at its lowest. Alleviation of conditions came when the [[McKinley Act]] of 1890 eliminated import duties on raw sugar. Consequently, prices of refined sugar dropped and there resulted an increase in sugar consumption. In spite of intense competition from Spreckels, the Trust saw profits increase, distributed large dividends, and continued to expand.
{{sfnp|Vogt|1908|p=46-47}}

In 1891 Havemeyer moved to acquire the remaining three Philadelphia refineries. The acquisition of E.C. Knight Company, one of the Philadelphia refineries, was challenged by the U. S. government in the landmark case, ''[[United States v. E. C. Knight Co.]]''. In 1895 the [[U. S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of the Sugar Trust, on the grounds that sugar refining was manufacture, not interstate commerce, and was therefore not under the jurisdiction of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], nor covered by the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].

=== Arbuckle Sugar and Coffee War 1898-1901 ===
In 1898 [[John Arbuckle (disambiguation)|John Arbuckle]], a coffee merchant and wholesale grocer from [[Pittsburgh]], head of the Coffee Trust, entered the sugar market. Arbuckle had innovated in the automated packaging of his coffee beans and began to repackage sugar, which he bought from the Sugar Trust, to sell alongside his coffee beans.{{sfnp|Havemeyer|2010|p=58}} Arbuckle moved to produce his own sugar and built a refinery in [[Brooklyn]]. Thereafter Havemeyer and Arbuckle entered into a fierce competition. Havemeyer bought controlling interest in a coffee business, Woolson Spice Company of [[Toledo, Ohio]], in order to undercut Arbuckle's prices. Arbuckle retaliated by lowering prices on the sugar produced at his new refinery. The price war continued for three years. In 1901 the two men came to an agreement to end their costly war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coppin|first=Clayton|title=John Arbuckle: Entrpreneur, Trust Buster, Humanitarian|url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/john-arbuckle-entrepreneur-trust-buster-humanitarian#axzz2lVxfqGsd|work=FEE|accessdate=6 December 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congressional investigations ===
On June 12, 1894 H.O. Havemeyer testified before a special committee of senators appointed to investigate the Sugar Trust. He admitted to lobbying on behalf of his interests, which he claimed was within his rights and was common practice. A request was made by a senator to review all the political contributions made by the American Sugar Refining Company in 1892-1893. After seeking counsel, at his next appearance before the committee, Havemeyer declined to submit his company’s books for examination or to answer any further questions.{{sfnp|Weitzenhoffer|1986|p=96}} In 1897 Havemeyer was brought to trial for contempt of court for refusing to answer the questions put to him by a committee of the [[United States Senate]] investigating the amount of donations his company had made to national and state political campaigns in 1892 and 1893. He was found not guilty and the indictment was dismissed.{{sfnp|Havemeyer|2010|p=107}}

=== National Sugar Refining Company of New Jersey (1900) ===
As a result of the Arbuckle price war, the few independent refineries that were built in the 1890s began to experience financial difficulties. Taking advantage of this, H.O. Havemeyer moved to acquire the remaining independent firms: the Mollenhauers Refinery in Brooklyn, National Sugar Company in [[Yonkers]], New York Refining Company in [[Long Island City]]. He did so anonymously, using James H. Post, partner in the independent sugar broker firm B. H. Howell, Son &amp; Company. The three refineries were consolidated into the National Sugar Refining Company of New Jersey, with James H. Post as president and B.H. Howell, Son &amp; Company handling the mercantile side of the business. On May 31, 1900, the National Sugar Refining Company of New Jersey was incorporated in New Jersey. Although independent of the Sugar Trust, the American Sugar Refining Company owned half its stock and the National received preferential treatment from the Sugar Trust.{{sfnp|Catlin Jr.|1988|p=26-33}}

=== Expanding west (1902) ===
After the turn of the century, Havemeyer expanded the Sugar Trust's holdings to the [[sugar beet]] industry in the West. In 1902 he consolidated four small [[Utah]] factories into the [[Amalgamated Sugar Company]]. Also that year, working with [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), he revitalized the [[Utah-Idaho Sugar Company]]. In 1905 he consolidated a group of small sugar factories in [[Colorado]] into the [[Great Western Sugar Company]]. The Sugar Trust also acquired an interest in the [[Michigan Sugar Company]], the Continental Sugar Company and a half-interest in Spreckels Beet Sugar Company of California.{{sfnp|Havemeyer II|1944|p=69}}

=== Expanding south (1906) ===
In 1892 Havemeyer made his first investment in Cuban raw sugar by investing in the Trinidad Sugar Company along with Charles H. Senff and Edwin Atkins. In 1906 Havemeyer formed the Cuban American Sugar company, centralizing the management of five Cuban raw sugar manufacturers.{{sfnp|Havemeyer|2010|p=79-81}}

=== Customs fraud 1907 ===
In November 1907, two weeks before Havemeyer's death, a raid of the docks at the Havemeyer plant in Brooklyn by the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] revealed that the scales that were used to weigh incoming raw sugar had been tampered with and the firm had underpaid import duties.{{sfnp|Weitzenhoffer|1986|p=180}} Two United States special customs agents, Richard Parr and James O. Brzezinski, tipped off by a disgruntled employee, discovered a concealed spring inserted into the scale which permitted the checker to exert pressure so as to reduce the weight. The criminal case against the American Sugar Refining Company was brought to federal court in New York in 1908 by District Attorney [[Henry L. Stimson]] and [[Felix Frankfurter]], and was won by the government in 1909.{{sfnp|Weitzenhoffer|1986|p=187-188}} A civil suit followed to collect custom duties owed to the government. To avoid further litigation and bad publicity, the American Sugar Refining Company agreed to settle the customs fraud case for $2 million in back payment. Individual officers of the American Sugar Refining Company were tried separately for criminal involvement. In 1909 dock foreman Oliver Spitzer was convicted for attempted bribery. Ernest Gerbracht, superintendent, and Charles R. Heike, secretary, and five company checkers were also convicted.{{sfnp|Havemeyer II|1944|p=69-70}}

== Personal and family life ==
In March 1870 H.O. Havemeyer married Mary Louise Elder. Mary Louise, known as Louise, was the sister of H.O.’s brother-in-law J. Lawrence Elder. It was a short and unhappy marriage. They were divorced in 1882, with no children.{{sfnp|Havemeyer|2010|p=25-26}}

On August 22, 1883, H.O. Havemeyer married 28-year-old [[Louisine Elder Havemeyer|Louisine W. Elder]], the daughter of George W. Elder and Matilda Waldron Elder. The Havemeyers had three children:
* Adaline Havemeyer (1884–1963), married to Peter Hood Ballantine Frelinghuysen
* Horace Havemeyer (1886–1956), married to Doris Dick Havemeyer
* [[Electra Havemeyer Webb|Electra Havemeyer]] (1888–1960), married to [[James Watson Webb II]]

Although each of the children collected art in their own right, [[Electra Havemeyer Webb]] collected on the grand scale of her parents and went on to found a museum to showcase her deep and diverse collections.

== Musical interests ==
H.O. Havemeyer was an amateur violinist. He was a student of noted violinist Frederick Mollenhauer. It was his daily recreation and he would frequently play for three hours a day. H.O. and Louisine Havemeyer held regular Sunday musicales at their home at 1 East 66th Street.&lt;ref&gt;Havemeyer, Louisine W. Sixteen to Sixty: Memoirs of a Collector. New York: Ursus Press, 1961, 1993, p. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Osborne and other members of the family were major collectors of instruments. Some of the most important instruments they collectively owned were two violins: the 1723 [[Antonio Stradivari|Stradivari]] 'Kiesewette' (played by Maxim Vengerov, Ilya Gringolts, Stefan Jackiw, Philippe Quint and most recently Augustin Hadelich),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tarisio.com/cozio-archive/browse-the-archive/owners/?Entity_ID=4555|title=Historical Owners (A-Z) - Tarisio|website=Tarisio|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1737 [[Guarneri]] 'del Gesù' "King Joseph",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tarisio.com/cozio-archive/browse-the-archive/owners/?Entity_ID=4555|title=Historical Owners (A-Z) - Tarisio|website=Tarisio|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three cellos: 1711 [[Antonio Stradivari|Stradivari]] "Duport" (ex-Rostropovich),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tarisio.com/cozio-archive/browse-the-archive/owners/?Entity_ID=4555|title=Historical Owners (A-Z) - Tarisio|website=Tarisio|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1714 [[Antonio Stradivari|Stradivari]] "Batta" (ex-Piatigorsky and most recently on loan to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tarisio.com/cozio-archive/browse-the-archive/owners/?Entity_ID=4555|title=Historical Owners (A-Z) - Tarisio|website=Tarisio|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1743 [[Giovanni Battista Guadagnini|Guadagnini]] "Havemeyer".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tarisio.com/cozio-archive/browse-the-archive/owners/?Entity_ID=4443|title=Historical Owners (A-Z) - Tarisio|website=Tarisio|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art collecting and Patronage ==
[[File:Havemeyer Sideboard by Pottier &amp; Stymus.png|thumb|Sideboard by Pottier &amp; Stymus owned by Henry Osborne Havemeyer. Circa 1875-1885]]
H.O. Havemeyer's first art purchases were made during his visit in 1876 to the [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]] with [[Samuel Colman]]. He bought carved ivory figures, Japanese lacquered boxes, silk, brocades, and sword guards. Typically his purchases were impulsive, numerous, and deeply personal. Both H.O. and Louisine had distinct tastes for art collecting that largely complemented each other. Both H.O. and Louisine had to be in agreement as to an object's worth for it to enter their now legendary collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kimmelman|first=Michael|title=Havemeyer Collection: Magic at the Met|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/26/arts/review-art-havemeyer-collection-magic-at-the-met-museum.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=7 December 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 March 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louisine focused on collecting modern works by European painters, including the then-unappreciated Impressionists. She was most influenced by her close friend [[Mary Cassatt]], who encouraged her to buy works by [[Edgar Degas]] and [[Claude Monet]].  Louisine would make 33 transatlantic crossings, returning from each major trip with a bounty of great western art.

In her will, Louisine identified some 142 works as a bequest to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and empowered her children to give the museum's curators free rein. By the time they had finished an inventory of the Havemeyer's three-story Fifth Avenue home 1,967 works would be assimilated into the Met's holdings, identified as the H.O. Havemeyer Collection.{{sfnp|Weitzenhoffer|1986|p=251-252}} The Havemeyer collection is represented throughout the galleries, but notably by the sheer volume of works present in the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] collection.&lt;ref name=Hawley&gt;{{Cite book |author=Charles Caldwell Hawley |title=A Kennecott Story |publisher=The University of Utah Press |year=2014 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some choice works from the Havemeyer collection are on view at the [[Shelburne Museum]] and the [[University of Michigan Museum of Art]].

== Homes ==

=== Hilltop, Greenwich, CT ===
In 1889 H.O. Havemeyer purchased 90 acres on Palmer Hill Road in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], on which to build a country home. The parcel had been owned by the Palmer and Quintard families for many generations, and was located to the north of [[Boston Post Road]], east of the [[Mianus River]], including  200 virgin acres at Mianus Ridge and Valley.{{sfnp|Havemeyer|2010|p=43, 45}} The house was called Hilltop and had a view of [[Long Island Sound]]. It was designed by [[Boston]] firm [[Peabody and Stearns]], three stories high with numerous facades, high gables, and six large chimneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Villa on the Sound|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1890-10-19/ed-1/seq-19/|work=New-York Tribune, 19 October 1890|accessdate=6 December 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Colman designed the interiors and furnishings. Walls were covered with Japanese papers. The dining room was modeled after 17th Century Dutch paintings. The library was the principal room adorned with bookshelves, paintings and musical instruments.{{sfnp|Weitzenhoffer|1986|p=52}} Superintendent James Troy managed the property, which included barns for horses, cows and pigs. The stables complemented the architecture of the house. There were three long greenhouses and acres of fruit trees and vegetable gardens. Figs were grown, as were orchids and gardenias. A grapery produced [[Concord grapes]], both purple and light green, which won prizes at the [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]] flower show. The head gardener was George Morrow.{{sfnp|Havemeyer|2010|p=47-48}}

=== 1 East 66th Street ===
In 1889 the Havemeyers purchased land at the corner of 66th Street and Fifth Avenue and hired architect [[Charles Coolidge Haight]] (1841-1917) to design a building for their residence. Built in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style, the residence was four stories high with a round turreted bay at the corner.{{sfnp|Frelinghuysen|Tinterow|Tinterow|Stein|Wold|Meech|1993|p=173}} To design the interiors of the home, the Havemeyers hired the interior design firm of [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] and [[Samuel Colman]]. Construction of the building was complete in 1890; the interiors were finished by 1892. A work of art in their own right, the interiors were designed as a harmonious environment in which to display the Havemeyers collections of Asian art, Islamic pottery, Dutch and Impressionist paintings.

Tiffany and Colman designed every detail of the interior and its furnishings. They were inspired by the exotic cultures of the Near and Far East. Each room was thematically unique and covered with sumptuous materials, such as embroidered silks and Tiffany-designed glass tiles. Many of the materials used, including in the leaded-glass windows, light fixtures, mosaics and balustrades. were fabricated at the [[Tiffany Studios|Tiffany Glass and Decorating Co.]], and the interiors displayed Tiffany’s "genius as a colorist and a luminist."{{sfnp|Frelinghuysen|Tinterow|Stein|Wold|Meech|1993|p=177}} Islamic-themed mosaics covered the walls of the front hall. Chinese embroidered silk hangings covered the walls of the reception room. Japanese silk brocade panels were assembled by Coleman from the pieces Havemeyer had bought from the [[Centennial Exhibition]] in 1876. These fabric panels adorned the ceiling in H.O. Havemeyer’s library, which was called the Rembrandt Room as it housed his collection of Dutch paintings. In the music room, where the Sunday musicales were held, walls were hung with Chinese embroideries and lit by a magnificent Tiffany-designed chandelier, inspired by the wildflower Queen Anne’s lace and made of clusters of opalescent blown-glass balls.{{sfnp|Frelinghuysen|Tinterow|Tinterow|Stein|Wold|Meech|1993|p=180-186}} The most spectacular element of the home was the flying staircase, inspired by that of [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Venice’s Doge’s Palace]]. It connected a balcony that circled the upper half of the two-story picture gallery to the room below. Suspended from the ceiling by sparkling chains and fringed with crystal, the stairs floated on a curved piece of cast iron and would tinkle when crossed.&lt;ref&gt;Saarinen, Aline B. Proud Possessors. New York: Random House, 1958, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The house was torn down after Louisine Havemeyer’s death in 1929. Some parts of the house are in the collection of the [[University of Michigan Museum of Art]].

The carriage house and stables were located at 126 East 66th Street, west of Third Avenue, designed in 1895 by H.O. Havemeyer’s cousin William J. Wallace and S.E. Gage and later owned by [[John Hay Whitney]].&lt;ref&gt;Willensky, Elliot, and Norval White.

=== Islip, Long Island ===
The Havemeyers spent the months of July and August in [[Islip (hamlet), New York|Islip, Long Island]], where H.O. Havemeyer sailed on the [[Great South Bay]]. In 1890 they bought property on St. Mark’s Lane in Islip, Long Island, next door to Louisine Havemeyer’s sister and brother-in-law, Adaline and Samuel T. Peters. In 1900 the Havemeyers moved into the Bayberry Point community that H.O. had developed, occupying the southwesterly house. Havemeyer owned a Herreshoff 30 named ''Electra'' which he raced in the Great South Bay.{{sfnp|Havemeyer|2010|p=43, 117}}

=== Merrivale Farm, Commack, Long Island ===
Havemeyer purchased 500 acres in [[Commack, New York|Commack, Long Island]], neighboring the racetrack of [[Carll S. Burr Mansion|Carll S. Burr]], who was engaged in breeding and training of trotting horses. Havemeyer was an avid hunter of ducks and other game birds. He owned a large stable of trotting horses and established a pheasant shooting preserve on land nearby.{{sfnp|Havemeyer|2010|p=50-51}}

== Philanthropy ==
Havemeyer was a trustee of the [[American Museum of Natural History]]{{sfnp|Havemeyer II|1944|p=70}} He and his brothers gave [[Havemeyer Hall]] for a [[Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Mines to Columbia University]] as a memorial for their father Frederick C. Havemeyer Jr. who studied at [[Columbia University|Columbia College]] from 1821-1823.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Havemeyer Hall|url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/havemeyerhall.html|work=American Chemical Society|accessdate=6 December 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Havemeyer gave a school to the Town of Greenwich, Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1900/06/09/102598470.pdf Mr. Havemeyer's Offer to Greenwich]" New York Times, 9 June 1900. (Link to pdf.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
H.O. Havemeyer died on December 4, 1907, at Merrivale Farm in Commack, Long Island, after a sudden illness.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1907-12-05/ed-1/seq-1/ H.O. Havemeyer Dead]," The Sun, 5 December 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; He was at Merrivale Farm with his son Horace for a Thanksgiving visit to shoot pheasant; his wife Louisine remained in New York City to be by her dying mother’s bedside. After Thanksgiving lunch, Havemeyer was stricken with acute indigestion. The local doctor was called, but could not help.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/12/05/101858126.pdf H.O. Havemeyer Dies at L.I. Home]," New York Times, 5 December 1907. (Link to pdf.)&lt;/ref&gt; His wife and daughter Electra arrived the next morning with three New York City doctors; however, Havemeyer was beyond help. He lived for five days before dying at 3 p.m. on December 4. The cause of death is thought to be peritonitis, as a consequence of undetermined digestive failure, and subsequent kidney failure.{{sfnp|Catlin Jr.|1988|p=420-421}} Funeral services were held at his home at 1 East 66th Street officiated by Rev. Dr. [[R. Heber Newton]], an Episcopalian minister. Havemeyer was buried at [[Green-Wood Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/12/08/104712445.pdf Henry O.

[[Junior Achievement]] (JA) was founded in 1919 by [[Theodore Vail]], president of [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph]]; Horace Moses, president of Strathmore Paper Co.; and Senator Murray Crane of [[Massachusetts]]. Its first program, The Company Program, was offered to [[high school]] students on an after-school basis. In 1975, the organization entered the classroom with the introduction of Project Business for the middle grades. Since then, Junior Achievement has gradually expanded its activities and broadened its scope to encompass an ever-widening student population.

Junior Achievement of South Florida&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jasouthflorida.org   Junior Achievement of South Florida]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded locally in 1959 by the [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] [[Rotary Club]] and served just 373 high school students during its first year. Programs now span grades K-12, with [[age appropriate]] curricula designed to teach [[Elementary school|elementary students]] about their roles as individuals, workers, and consumers and to prepare middle grade and high school students for key economic and workforce issues they will face. Junior Achievement programs reached 44,000 [[Broward County, Florida|Broward]] and [[Palm Beach County, Florida|South Palm Beach County]] students during the 2009-2010 [[school year]].

==Programs==

Junior Achievement of South Florida offers age-appropriate curricula to ensure that students understand their roles as future members of the business community. The programs are divided into three categories: elementary, [[middle school]] and [[high school]].

===Elementary===

The elementary school programs include six sequential themes for [[kindergarten]] through fifth-grade students and one capstone experience. Students learn the basic concepts of [[business]] and economics and how education is relevant to the workplace. The activities build on studies from each preceding grade and prepare students for secondary school and continued learning. Fifth graders can have the opportunity to work at JA BizTown, a facility on the [[Broward College]] campus.

===Middle School===

The middle school programs emphasize the value of workforce readiness, entrepreneurship, and [[financial literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Tyko, Kelly. "Treasure Coast educators get look at Junior Achievement center" [http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2011/jan/14/treasure-coast-educators-get-good-look-at-junior/?partner=yahoo_feeds]&lt;/ref&gt; Students are also introduced to many economic concepts and facts about the working world.

The programs in this level expand upon the concepts that were learned in elementary school and help teens make good decisions about their futures. Junior Achievement’s lessons are meant to supplement standard [[social studies]] curricula and develop [[communication skills]]. 8th graders have the opportunity to work beyond JA BizTown to JA Finance Park, also on the [[Broward College]] campus.

===High School===

The high school programs teach students about concepts relating to entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and [[work readiness]]. Students are encouraged to make informed decisions about their future, and foster skills that will be useful in the business world. Volunteers aid in these goals by bringing real-life business experience into the classroom, which reinforce the lessons that are taught.

==JA World Huizenga Center at Broward College==

Since its inception, Junior Achievement has been committed to "[[experiential learning]]." Taking it to the next level, Junior Achievement of South Florida created the [http://www.floridatrend.com/life_article.asp?cName=Lifestyle&amp;rName=Lifestyle+Features&amp;whatID=1&amp;aID=51599&amp;aID2=47918  JA World Huizenga center] at [[Broward College]] that houses two new programs: JA BizTown and JA Finance Park. This dramatic shift forward will significantly transform how every local student is taught to view the world of work, [[free enterprise]] and their possibilities for success in it. Through the experiential learning derived from both BizTown and Finance Park, students achieve advanced levels of engagement, reflection, and personal  responsibility.

===JA BizTown===

JA BizTown is a miniature city that allows fifth-graders the opportunity to assume roles as proprietors, civic leaders, and consumers. It greatly increases  students’ knowledge of the free enterprise system as they learn how to fulfill the goals of satisfying customers, paying-off business loans, and realizing a profit at the conclusion of the business day.

===JA Finance Park===

JA Finance Park expands upon the lessons learned in JA BizTown by giving students an identity to manage that includes marital status, number of children, annual income, education attained, and job type. Students take these characteristics into consideration as they prepare budgets that take into 	consideration housing, food, furniture, insurance, education, automobiles, [[investment]]s, and more. Providing a real life experience of managing an [[income]] and learning to live within your means offers a strong and important lesson on the value of staying in school to maximize earning potential.

Dr '''Kailash Chandra Mishra''' is known as a management teacher, [[orator]], researcher and writer. He relocated from the [[Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management]], Delhi to take over as the first Vice Chancellor of [[Sri Sri University]] in Orissa founded by [[Sri Sri Ravishankar]] with patronage from Government of Odisha. The saga of his institution building is not without hurdles but the final outcome is in the interest of society.

== Books ==

His books include ''The Game is changing: Insurance Reloaded''; ''Insurance Demystified: Reading beyond the lexicon''; ''Medical Informatics: An exploration''; ''Finance for family managed business and Financial Management: In the era of reforms''. He is a newspaper columnist and used to write a column every Saturday in [[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]] – Money – Comments. He has more than three hundred published papers in various national and international management journals. In 2008 he has published eight textbooks through Cengage learning (Previously Thomson learning) in New Delhi. These books include: ''Insurance Business Environment and Insurance Company operations''; ''Life Insurance : Principles &amp; Practice''; ''General Insurance : Principles &amp; Practice''; ''Financial Management &amp; Insurance Accounting''; ''Elements of Actuarial Science''; ''Legal &amp; Regulatory Aspects of Insurance''; ''Basics of Personal Financial Planning''; and ''Life Insurance Underwriting''. Each of these books was coauthored by one of his doctoral students or management associates. He has also published in 2008 two other books through ICFAI Publication, namely "Enjoying IIT-Jee" and Organizational Adaptation – A tag study of General Insurance TAC in India". In April 2011 he gave the ninth Odisha Swaviman Lecture "Orissa Civil Society Begs for a Shake", which was published as an Oriya book by the NGO ''Āma Oḍishā'' in Bhubaneswar.

== Management frameworks ==

He is credited with creating cited management frameworkslike "Mishra's Seven A framework of insurance management", first published in his book ''Insurance Reloaded'' ICFAI Publication, Hyderabad, India, "APES framework for insurance organization", first published in USA, Chamber and Partners' journal ''Mondaq.com'', "Mishra theory of preference dynamics in investment", first cited in his D.Litt. thesis "Mutual Funds in the emerging market", "Seven P framework of underwriting", first published in "Asia Insurance Post, Mumbai, india and "3L framework of retrocession planning", first published in the journal "Bima Quest", Pune, India.

== Extramural innovations ==

In various management schools he has founded, he has introduced some extramurals like BEAD (Business Etics Advancement and Development), MID (Management Intrapreneurship Development), STUDENT (Structuring The Unstructured by Discussion, Evolution, Negotiation and Training), POY (Power of You) and INLAB (Insurance Laboratory). At SPJIMR, ASCI and NIASOM, he introduced the concept of self-audit for management students – where the students takes responsibility for a part of his syllabus, topic, teacher, examination and examiner. Students' participation in management of business school is his avowed ideal. When enquired as to why he has not started any further experimentation at [[Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management]] (LBSIM), of which he was the Director, he has an interesting response. Lal Bahadur Shastri's Himalayan legacy runs at LBSIM. [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] was known for his simplicity, honesty, integrity and assertiveness. Anyone understanding these values and internalizing the principles as a way of life does not need any further extramurals. At [[Sri Sri University]] he has introduced a concept for management students called ADLOP (Assessment and Development of Leadership and Outreach Potential).

== Academics ==

By qualification he is MSc in [[solid-state physics]] with three gold medals, [[MBA]], CAIIB and Doctor of Literature ([[D.Litt]])in [[Managerial finance|Financial Management]].

He took charge of first whistle blowing Ombudsperson of Mutual Funds at UTI.

He is an expert committee member of EPFO for pension reforms and is also associated with RBI and SEBI in regulatory best practices.

Currently he advises several ministries of the [[Government of India]] and he has advised eight different ministries of the Government of India in the past.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A change in exchange rates can be a cause of loss (or gain) in international trade, thus the settlement of debts is expedited or delayed in an attempt to minimize the loss or to maximize the gain. In the leads and lags, the premature payment for goods purchased  is called a "lead," while the delayed payment is called a "lag."&lt;ref name="Mehmet 2015" /&gt;

== Description ==
A change in exchange rates can be a cause of loss (or gain) in international trade. For example, now, we suppose that the [[euro]] to [[U.S. dollar]] exchange rate is 1.00 (€1.00 buys one dollar). In addition, we suppose that an importer of U.S. buys goods for €1000 from a European exporter and the U.S. importer will pay the money 1 month later. If the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate is 2.00 one month later, the U.S. importer must prepare €1000 with $2000 in the [[foreign exchange market]] for the payment. On the other hand, If the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate is 0.50 one month later, the U.S. importer is able to prepare €1000 with $500 for the payment.
 
Thus, if a rise in the exchange rates is expected in the future, the buyer may delay the payment of goods because such a delay can make purchasing the goods less costly.&lt;ref name="Mehmet 2015" /&gt; Conversely, if a decline in the exchange rates is expected in the future, the buyer may pay ahead of time to minimize the loss.&lt;ref name="Mehmet 2015" /&gt;

This is a '''list of bottle types, brands and companies'''. A [[bottle]] is a rigid [[Food storage container|container]] with a neck that is narrower than the body, and a "mouth". Bottles are often made of [[glass]], [[clay]], [[plastic]], [[aluminum]] or other impervious materials, and are typically used to store [[liquid]]s. The bottle has developed over millennia of use, with some of the earliest examples appearing in [[China]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Rome]] and [[Crete]]. Bottles are often [[recycle]]d according to the SPI [[recycling code]] for the material. Some regions have a [[container deposit legislation|container deposit]] which is refunded after returning the bottle to the retailer.

== Biography ==
Daish was born in [[Wellington]], New Zealand and grew up in the suburb of [[Roseneath, Wellington|Roseneath.]] While young, her family moved to New York for two years as her father had a job at the United Nations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/the-wellingtonian/3119501/The-Wellingtonian-interview-Lois-Daish|title=The Wellingtonian interview: Lois Daish|last=Romanos|first=Joseph|date=3 December 2009|newspaper=Stuff.co.nz|language=English|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early exposure to American food influenced her interest and taste in food in later years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Mary Wells Lawrence''' (born '''Mary Georgene Berg''' on May 25, 1928 in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], [[United States]]) is a retired American advertising executive.  She was the founding president of '''Wells, Rich, Greene''',&lt;ref name="ElliottLegendNYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WRG"/&gt;  an [[advertising agency]] known for its creative work.&lt;ref name="ArchivesDukeUniversity"/&gt; Lawrence was the first female [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of a company listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].

==Education and early years==
In the late 1940s, Lawrence studied for two years at the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], where she met industrial design student Burt Wells.  While there she became a member of [[Kappa Alpha Theta]].  In 1949, they married and moved to Youngstown, Ohio. She began her advertising career there in 1951, as a [[Copywriting|copywriter]] for McKelvey’s department store. She relocated to [[New York City]], where she studied [[theatre]] and [[drama]]. By 1952, she had become [[Macy's]] fashion [[Advertising management|advertising manager]]. She divorced Wells that year, only to remarry him in 1954. Lawrence worked as a copywriter and copy group head at [[McCann Erickson]] in 1953, later joining the Lennen &amp; Newell advertising agency's "[[Think tank|brain trust]]." In 1957, she began a seven-year tenure at Doyle Dane Bernbach (now [[DDB Worldwide]]). In her 2002 book, ''A Big Life in Advertising,'' Lawrence cited DDB partners [[James Edwin Doyle]], [[Maxwell Dane]], and [[William Bernbach]] as significant influences on her subsequent career.&lt;ref name="WhartonReview"/&gt;

==Family==
Lawrence had two daughters with Bert Wells, Pamela and Kathy.  She divorced Bert a second time in 1965, and married former [[Braniff Airways|Braniff International Airways]] president [[Harding Lawrence]] on November 25, 1967.&lt;ref name="Big Life"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norwich"/&gt;  Mr. Lawrence had four children: sons Harding, Jr., who died in infancy, James B., State R.,and one daughter, Deborah. He died on February 16, 2002 at age 81 of pancreatic cancer.&lt;ref name="Gilpin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McMurtrey"/&gt;

==Jack Tinker and Partners and Braniff==
Lawrence went to work for Jack Tinker and his new advertising group, Jack Tinker and Partners.  The members of this revolutionary new think tank were dubbed "Tinker's Thinkers".  The "Thinkers" would create ad campaigns for other agencies at [[Interpublic]], a holding company of many US advertising firms. Lawrence had previously worked for Tinker at McCann-Erickson, and was excited to partner with him again. Her star rose in the advertising world &lt;ref name="WRG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilpin"/&gt; with the success of her advertising campaign for [[Braniff International Airways]], "The End of the Plain Plane".&lt;ref name="ModernistGirard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GirardSFMOMA"/&gt; She hired [[Alexander Girard]] as project designer, and designer [[Emilio Pucci]] to create new uniforms for the airline's flight attendants and crew. The campaign was lauded as critical to the airline's revolutionary turnaround.

==Wells Rich Greene==
Following the success of the Braniff campaign, Lawrence founded Wells Rich Greene on April 5, 1966, and became the agency's [[president]]. Partner Richard Rich acted as the agency's [[treasurer]], and Stewart Greene its [[Company secretary|secretary]].&lt;ref name="ElliottLegendNYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WRG"/&gt; Major WRG clients included [[American Motors]], [[Cadbury Schweppes]], [[IBM]], [[MCI Communications]], [[Pan American World Airways]], [[Trans World Airlines]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Nestlé Purina PetCare|Ralston Purina]], [[RC Cola]], and [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts]].&lt;ref name="ArchivesDukeUniversity"/&gt; Braniff remained a Wells Rich Greene client through 1968.

By 1969, Lawrence was reported to be the highest-paid executive in advertising. She was selected by U.S. Vice President [[Nelson Rockefeller]] to be a member of his [[Commission on Critical Choices for Americans]], and was also invited by U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]] to represent business at an Economic Summit in [[Washington, D.C.]]

After Lawrence stepped down as CEO in 1990, the agency was sold to Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit, and became known as Wells Rich Greene BDDP.&lt;ref name="ArchivesDukeUniversity"/&gt; The agency officially ceased operations in 1998, and donated its archive of print and television ads to [[Duke University]]'s John W. Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising and Marketing History.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26626">'''Mobile Business Intelligence''' (Mobile BI or Mobile Intelligence) is defined as “Mobile BI is a system comprising both technical and organizational elements that present historical and/or real-time information to its users for analysis on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets (not laptops), to enable effective decision-making and management support, for the overall purpose of increasing firm performance.” (Peters et al., 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=Twan|last2=Isik|first2=Öykü|last3=Olgerta|first3=Tona|last4=Popovic|first4=Aleš | title = How system quality influences mobile BI use: The mediating role of engagement | journal= (IJIM) International Journal of Information Management|date=2016|volume=36|issue=5|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401216300779|doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2016.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business intelligence]] (BI) refers to computer-based techniques used in spotting, digging-out, and analyzing business data, such as sales revenue by products and/or departments or associated costs and incomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/ BusinessDictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the concept of mobile computing has been prevalent for over a decade, Mobile BI has shown a momentum/growth only very recently.{{when|date=June 2011}} This change has been partly encouraged by a change from the ‘wired world’ to a wireless world with the advantage of [[smartphones]] which has led to a new era of mobile computing, especially in the field of BI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.information-management.com/specialreports/2008_89/10001705-1.html?pg=1Mobile Business Intelligence for Intelligent Businesses]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Aberdeen Group, a large number of companies are rapidly undertaking mobile BI owing to a large number of market pressures such as the need for higher efficiency in business processes, improvement in employee productivity (e.g., time spent looking for information), better and faster decision making, better customer service, and delivery of real-time bi-directional data access to make decisions anytime and anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/channels/enterprise_applications/development/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=VCS3TZ0FEKCO5QE1GHRSKHWATMY32JVN?articleID=212300110 Mobile Business Intelligence: Best-in-Class Secrets to Success]&lt;/ref&gt; But despite the apparent advantages of mobile information delivery, mobile BI is still in the ‘early adopter’ phase. Some CFOs remain skeptical of the business benefits and with the perceived lack of specific business use cases and tangible ROI, mobile BI adoption is still behind the curve compared with other enterprise mobile applications.&lt;ref&gt;FSN publication, [http://www.fsn.co.uk/channel_bi_bpm_cpm/why_cfos_must_embrace_the_new_era_of_mobile_bi_and_enterprise_performance_management   "Why CFOs must embrace the new era of mobile BI and Enterprise Performance Management "], July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Information delivery to mobile devices ===
The predominant method for accessing BI information is using proprietary software or a [[Web browser]] on a personal computer to connect to BI applications. These BI applications request data from databases. Starting in the late 1990s, BI systems offered alternatives for receiving [[data]], including email and mobile devices.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.

===Static data push===
Initially, mobile devices such as pagers and mobile phones received pushed data using a short message service ([[SMS]]) or text messages. These applications were designed for specific mobile devices, contained minimal amounts of information, and provided no data interactivity.  As a result, the early mobile BI applications were expensive to design and maintain while providing limited informational value, and garnered little interest.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Data access via a mobile browser===
The [[mobile browser]] on a [[smartphone]], a handheld computer integrated with a mobile phone,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=Smartphone&amp;i=51537,00.asp Smartphone definition]&lt;/ref&gt; provided a means to read simple tables of data. The small screen space, immature mobile browsers, and slow data transmission could not provide a satisfactory BI experience.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
Accessibility and bandwidth may be perceived as issues when it comes to mobile technology, but BI solutions provide advanced functionality to predict and outperform such potential challenges.  While Web-based mobile BI solutions provide little to no control over the processing of data in a network, managed BI solutions for mobile devices only utilize the server for specific operations. In addition, local reports are compressed both during transmission and on the device, permitting greater flexibility for storage and receipt of these reports. Within a mobile environment, users capitalize on easy access to information because the mobile application operates within a single authoring environment that permits access to all BI content (respecting existing security) regardless of language or locale. Furthermore, the user will not need to build and maintain a separate mobile BI deployment.  In addition, mobile BI requires much less bandwidth for functionality.  Mobile BI promises a small report footprint on memory, encryption during transmission as well as on the device, and compressed data storage for offline viewing and use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.information-management.com/specialreports/2008_111/10002254-1.html?pg=2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobile client application===
In 2002, [[Research in Motion]] released the first [[BlackBerry]] smartphone optimized for wireless email use. [[Wireless e-mail]] proved to be the “killer app” that accelerated the popularity of the smartphone market.  By the mid-2000s, Research in Motion’s BlackBerry had solidified its hold on the smartphone market with both corporate and governmental organizations. The BlackBerry smartphones eliminated the obstacles to mobile business intelligence. The BlackBerry offered a consistent treatment of data across its many models, provided a much larger screen for viewing data, and allowed user interactivity via the thumbwheel and keyboard.  BI vendors re-entered the market with offerings spanning different mobile operating systems (BlackBerry, [[Windows]], [[Symbian]]) and data access methods. The two most popular data access options were:

* to use the mobile browser to access data, similar to desktop computer, and
* to create a native application designed specifically for the mobile device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/channels/business_intelligence/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=QJ2ILLXEXQ0SDQE1GHOSKHWATMY32JVN?articleID=207801077&amp;cid=RSSfeed_IE_News Intelligence on the Go: Mobile Delivery of BI]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Research in Motion]] is continuing to lose market share to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] smartphones.  In the first three months of 2011 Google’s Android OS gained 7 points of market share.  During the same time period RIM’s market share collapsed and dropped almost 5 points.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-04-02/tech/30089528_1_android-phones-google-s-android-smartphone-market&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose-built Mobile BI apps===
Apple quickly set the standard for mobile devices with the introduction of the [[iPhone]]. In the first three years, Apple sold over 33.75 million units.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/04/22results.html Apple Reports Second Quarter Results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521104112/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/04/22results.html |date=2011-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in 2010, Apple sold over 1 million iPads in just under three months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/36911690 Apple Sells 1 Million iPads]&lt;/ref&gt; Both devices feature an interactive touchscreen display that is the de facto standard on many mobile phones and tablet computers.

In 2008, Apple published the [[Software development kit|SDK]] for which developers can build applications that run natively on the iPhone and iPad instead of Safari-based applications. These native applications can give the user a robust, easier-to-read and easier-to-navigate experience.

Others were quick to join in the success of mobile devices and app downloads. The [[Google Play Store]] now has over 700,000 apps available for the mobile devices running the Android operating system.

More importantly, the advent of the mobile device has radically changed the way people use data on their mobile devices. This includes mobile BI. Business intelligence applications can be used to transform reports and data into mobile dashboards, and have them instantly delivered to any mobile device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/systems_management/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=224400267 |title=Mobile BI Apps Target iPad |last=Henschen |first=Doug |date=April 15, 2010 |work=InformationWeek }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google Inc.’s [[Android (operating system)|Android]] has overtaken Apple Inc.’s iOS in the wildly growing arena of app downloads. In the second quarter of 2011, 44% of all apps downloaded from app marketplaces across the web were for Android devices while 31% were for Apple devices, according to new data from ABI Research. The remaining apps were for various other mobile operating systems, including BlackBerry and Windows Phone 7.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internetretailer.com/2011/10/26/android-surpasses-apple-app-download-share&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile BI applications have evolved from being a client application for viewing data to a purpose-built application designed to provide information and workflows necessary to quickly make business decisions and take action.

===Web Applications vs. Device-Specific Applications for Mobile BI===
In early 2011, as the mobile BI software market started to mature and adoption started to grow at a significant pace in both small and large enterprises, most vendors adopted either a purpose-built, device-specific application strategy (e.g. [[iPhone]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] apps, downloaded from [[iTunes]] or the [[Google Play Store]]) or a web application strategy (browser-based, works on most devices without an application being installed on the device).  This debate continues and there are benefits and drawbacks to both methods.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eckerson, Wayne]]. [http://www.b-eye-network.com/blogs/eckerson/archives/2011/04/architecting_fo.php "Architecting for Mobile BI"], ''BeyeNetwork'', April 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  One potential solution will be the wider adoption of [[HTML5]] on mobile devices which will give web applications many of the characteristics of dedicated applications while still allowing them to work on many devices without an installed application.

[[Microsoft]] has announced their mobile BI strategy.  [[Microsoft]] plans to support browser-based applications such as Reporting Services and PerformancePoint on iOS in the first half of 2012 and touch-based applications on iOS and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] by the second half of 2012.  
Despite popular perception that [[Microsoft]] only acknowledges its own existence, recent moves suggest the company is aware that it is not the only player in the technology ecosystem. Instead of attempting to squelch competition or suggesting new technology developments were ridiculous, the company has instead decided to make its technology accessible to a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmswire.com/cms/mobile/microsoft-announces-mobile-business-intelligence-strategy-013091.php&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many mobile devices and platforms available today. The list is constantly growing and so is the platform support. There are hundreds of models available today, with multiple hardware and software combinations. The enterprise must select a device very carefully. The target devices will impact the mobile BI design itself because the design for a smartphone will be different than for a tablet. The screen size, processor, memory, etc. all vary. The mobile BI program must account for lack of device standardization from the providers by constantly testing devices for the mobile BI apps.
Some best practices can always be followed. For example, a smartphone is a good candidate for operational mobile BI. However, for analytics and what-if analysis, tablets are the best option. Hence, the selection or availability of the device plays a big role in the implementation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.information-management.com/newsletters/mobile_BI_integration_apps_data_management-10020527-1.html?pg=3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demand==
[[Gartner]] analyst Ted Friedman believes that mobile delivery of BI is all about practical, tactical information needed to make immediate decisions – "The biggest value is in operational BI — information in the context of applications — not in pushing lots of data to somebody's phone."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9179090/Business_intelligence_goes_mobile?taxonomyId=9&amp;pageNumber=1 Business Intelligence Goes Mobile]&lt;/ref&gt;

Accessing the Internet through a mobile device such as a smartphone is also known as the mobile Internet or [[mobile Web]]. IDC expects the US mobile workforce to increase by 73% in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://img.en25.com/web/CitrixOnline/IDC_MobileWorker_excerpt_0_0.pdf Worldwide Mobi le Worker Population 2007–2011 Forecast]&lt;/ref&gt;  Morgan Stanley reports the mobile Internet is ramping up faster than its predecessor, the desktop Internet&lt;!--? No chart present in article... (see chart on the right)--&gt;, enabling companies to deliver knowledge to their mobile workforce to help them make more profitable decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morganstanley.com/institutional/techresearch/pdfs/Internet_Trends_041210.pdf Morgan Stanley - Internet Trends]&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Cooney from [[Gartner]] has identified bring-your-own-technology at work as becoming the norm, not the exception. By 2015 media tablet shipments will reach around 50% of laptop shipments and Windows 8 will likely be in third place behind Android and  Apple.  The net result is that Microsoft’s share of the client platform, be it PC, tablet or smartphone, will likely be reduced to 60% and it could fall below 50%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cio.com/article/692031/Gartner_the_Top_10_Strategic_Technology_Trends_for_2012?source=ctwartcio&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business Benefits==
In its latest [[Magic Quadrant]] for Business Intelligence Platforms, [[Gartner]] examines whether the platform enables users to "fully interact with BI content delivered to mobile devices."   The phrase "fully interact" is the key. The ability to send alerts embedded in email or text messages, or links to static content in email messages hardly represents sophistication in mobile analytics. 
For users to benefit from mobile BI, they must be able to navigate dashboard and guided analytics comfortably—or as comfortably as the mobile device will allow, which is where devices with high-resolution screens and touch interfaces (like the [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-based phones) have a clear edge over, say, earlier editions of [[BlackBerry]]. 
It is equally important to take a step back to define your purpose and adoption patterns. Which business users can benefit the most from mobile analytics—and what, exactly, is their requirement? You don't need mobile analytics to send a few alerts or summary reports to their handhelds—without interactivity, mobile BI is indistinguishable from merely informative email or text messages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/bi/229300446&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Similar to consumer applications, which have shown an ever-increasing growth over the past few years, a constant demand for anytime, anywhere access to BI is leading to a number of custom mobile application development.&lt;ref name="searchcio.techtarget.com"&gt;[http://searchcio.techtarget.com/news/1376914/IPhone-need-for-features-driving-plans-for-mobile-BI-app-development iPhone, Need for Features Driving Plans for Mobile BI App Development]&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses have also started adopting mobile solutions for their workforce and are soon becoming key components of core business processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.microsoft.com/download/A/9/F/A9F105FF-3C62-44B1-A1AE-71E267C31CFE/LOB_for_Midsize_Business_ROI_IDC_White_Paper.pdf Mobile Line-of-Business Applications for the Midsize Business: An ROI Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; In an Aberdeen survey conducted in May 2010, 23% of companies participating indicated that they now have a mobile BI app or dashboard in place, while another 31% indicated that they plan to implement some form of mobile BI in the next year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/home/News.asp?id=58375 Mobile BI - A Bonanza for many Businesses]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions===
Mobile BI applications can be defined/segregated as follows:

* '''Mobile Browser Rendered App''': Almost any mobile device enables Web-based, thin client, HTML-only BI applications. However, these apps are static and provide little data interactivity.  Data is viewed just as it would be over a browser from a personal computer.  Little additional effort is required to display data but mobile browsers can typically only support a small subset of the interactivity of a web browser.
* '''Customized App''': A step up from this approach is to render each (or all) reports and dashboards in device-specific format. In other words, provide information specific to the screen size, optimize usage of screen real estate, and enable device-specific navigation controls. Examples of these include thumb wheel or thumb button for BlackBerry, up/down/left/right arrows for Palm, gestural manipulation for iPhone. This approach requires more effort than the previous but no additional software.
* '''Mobile Client App''':  The most advanced, the client app provides full interactivity with the BI content viewed on the device. In addition, this approach provides periodic caching of data which can be viewed and analyzed even offline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.forrester.com/business_process/2009/11/not-all-mobile-bi-applications-are-created-equal.html Not all BI Applications are Created Equal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies across all verticals, from retail&lt;ref&gt;[http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/channels/business_intelligence/customer_intelligence/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=ZIXKX1N5D25C1QE1GHOSKHWATMY32JVN?articleID=207801077&amp;pgno=2 Intelligence on the Go: Mobile Delivery of BI]&lt;/ref&gt; to even non-profit organizations&lt;ref&gt;[http://napps.networkworld.com/news/2010/071410-mobile-bi-can-be-quick.html Mobile BI can be Quick]&lt;/ref&gt; are realizing the value of purpose-specific mobile applications suited for their mobile workforce.

==Development==
Developing a native mobile BI app poses challenges, especially concerning data display rendering and user interactivity.  Mobile BI App development has traditionally been a time-consuming and expensive effort requiring businesses to justify the investment for the mobile workforce. They do not only require texting and alerts, they need information customized for their line of work which they can interact with and analyze to gain deeper information.&lt;ref name="searchcio.techtarget.com"/&gt;

===Custom-coded Mobile BI Apps===
Mobile BI applications are often custom-coded apps specific to the underlying mobile operating system.  For example, the iPhone apps require coding in [[Objective-C]] while Android apps require coding in Java.  In addition to the user functionality of the app, the app must be coded to work with the supporting server infrastructure required to serve data to the mobile BI app.  While custom-coded apps offer near limitless options, the specialized software coding expertise and infrastructure can be expensive to develop, modify, and maintain.

===Fixed-form Mobile BI Applications===
Business data can be displayed in a mobile BI client (or web browser) that serves as a user interface to existing BI platforms or other data sources, eliminating the need for new master sources of data and specialized server infrastructure.  This option offers fixed and configurable data visualizations such as charts, tables, trends, KPIs, and links, and can usually be deployed quickly using existing data sources.  However, the data visualizations are not limitless and cannot always be extended to beyond what is available from the vendor.

===Graphical Tool-developed Mobile BI Apps===
Mobile BI apps can also be developed using the graphical, drag-and-drop development environments of BI platforms.  The advantages including the following:

# Apps can be developed without coding,
# Apps can be easily modified and maintained using the BI platform change management tools,
# Apps can use any range of data visualizations and not be limited to just a few,
# Apps can incorporate specific business workflows, and
# The BI platform provides the server infrastructure.

Using graphical BI development tools can allow faster mobile BI app development when a custom application is required.

==Security Considerations for Mobile BI Apps==
{{see also|Mobile security}}
High adoption rates and reliance on mobile devices makes safe mobile computing a critical concern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gigaom.com/2010/09/09/mobile-security-needs-rise-with-smartphone-sales/ Mobile Security Needs Rise With Smartphone Sales]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mobile Business Intelligence Market Study discovered that security is the number one issue (63%) for organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://businesssintelligence.blogspot.com/ Business Intelligence Blog by Howard Dresner]&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive mobile security solution must provide security at these levels:&lt;ref name="na.blackberry.com"&gt;[http://na.blackberry.com/ataglance/get_the_facts/Successful_Mobile_Deployments.pdf Successful Mobile Deployments Require Robust Security]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Device
* Transmission
* Authorization, Authentication, and [[Network security]]

===Device Security===
A senior analyst at the Burton Group research firm recommends that the best way to ensure data will not be tampered with is to not store it on the client device (mobile device). As such, there is no local copy to lose if the mobile device is stolen and the data can reside on servers within the data center with access permitted only over the network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cio.com/article/40360/Mobile_Security_Definition_and_Solutions?page=1&amp;taxonomyId=3061 Mobile Security Definition and Solutions]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most [[smartphone]] manufacturers provide a complete set of security features including full-disk encryption, email encryption, as well as remote management which includes the ability to wipe contents if device is lost or stolen.&lt;ref name="na.blackberry.com"/&gt; Also, some devices have embedded third-party antivirus and firewall software such as [[Research In Motion|RIM]]'s [[BlackBerry]].&lt;ref name="na.blackberry.com"/&gt;

===Transmission Security===
Transmission security refers to measures that are designed to protect data from unauthorized interception, traffic analysis, and imitative deception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/transmission-security]&lt;/ref&gt; These measures include [[Transport Layer Security|Secure Sockets Layer]] (SSL), iSeries Access for Windows, and [[virtual private network]] (VPN) connections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v5r4/index.jsp?topic=/rzaj4/rzaj45zhcryptointro.htm IBM: Transmission security options]&lt;/ref&gt; A secure data transmission should enable the identity of the sender and receiver to be verified by using a cryptographic shared key system as well as protect the data to be modified by a third party when it crosses the network. This can be done using [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|AES]] or [[Triple DES]] with an encrypted [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] tunnel.&lt;ref name="na.blackberry.com"/&gt;

===Authorization, Authentication, and Network Security===
Authorization refers to the act of specifying access rights to control access of information to users.&lt;ref&gt;[[Authorization|Wikipedia Article - Authorization]]&lt;/ref&gt; Authentication refers to the act of establishing or confirming the user as true or authentic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Authentication|Wikipedia Article - Authentication]]&lt;/ref&gt; Network security refers to all the provisions and policies adopted by the network administrator to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of the computer network and network-accessible resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networksfirst.com/knowledge-base/glossary/network-security-definition/ Definition of Network Security]&lt;/ref&gt; The mobility adds to unique security challenges. As data is trafficked beyond the enterprise firewall towards unknown territories, ensuring that it is handled safely is of paramount importance. Towards this, proper authentication of user connections, centralized access control (like LDAP Directory), encrypted data transfer mechanisms can be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expertstown.com/mobile-business-intelligence Expertstown.com - Mobile Business Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of BI for Securing Mobile Apps===
To ensure high security standards, BI software platforms must extend the authentication options and policy controls to the mobile platform. Business intelligence software platforms need to ensure a secure encrypted keychain for storage of credentials. Administrative control of password policies should allow creation of security profiles for each user and seamless integration with centralized security directories to reduce administration and maintenance of users.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

'''Amon Fasileau-Duplantier''', known as '''Monsieur Amon''' (22 December 1849 &amp;ndash; 24 February 1915), was a French [[coffee]] and urban real estate entrepreneur established in [[Costa Rica]].  Monsieur Amon commercial activities had a deep impact on the Costa Rican society of the latest 19th century due to the foundation of [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]]'s [[Belle Époque]] neighborhood which carries his name today as the Barrio Amón.  The image of Monsieur Amon is associated to Costa Rican coffee golden age.

== Life ==
Monsieur Amon was born in [[Bordeaux]].  He arrived to Costa Rica in his mid-twenties to work in The Tournon Company, owned by his brother- in-law, Mr. Hippolyte Tournon.  The company already produced and exported coffee; Monsieur Amon was entrusted to manage the firm and became a respected local figure with a key influence in the social and economic spheres.  He started the diversification to urban real estate and electricity production at the time [[Minor Keith]] developed similar activities, leveraging the Atlantic railroad construction and growing banana trade.  Monsieur Amon left Costa Rica to France in 1899 after being replaced by his nephew, and son of Mr. Hippolyte Tournon: Elois Tournon, as the head of the Tournon Company.

'''Product certification''' or '''product qualification''' is the process of certifying that a certain product has passed [[performance test (assessment)|performance test]]s and [[quality assurance]] tests, and meets qualification criteria stipulated in [[contract]]s, [[regulation]]s, or [[specification]]s (typically called "certification schemes" in the product certification industry).

Most product certification bodies (or product certifiers) are [[accreditation|accredited]] to ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996,&lt;ref name=Guide65&gt;ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996&lt;/ref&gt; an international standard for ensuring competence in those organizations performing product certifications.  The organizations that perform this accreditation are called Accreditation Bodies, and they themselves are assessed by international peers against the [[Accreditation|ISO 17011 standard]].&lt;ref name=ISO17011&gt;ISO/IEC 17011:2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Accreditation bodies that participate in the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) Multilateral Agreement (MLA)&lt;ref name="IAF_MLA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaf.nu//articles/IAF_MLA/14|title=IAF MLA|first=|last=elva|date=23 November 2016|work=iaf.nu}}&lt;/ref&gt; also ensure that these accredited Product Certifiers meet additional requirements set forth in "IAF GD5:2006 - IAF Guidance on the Application of ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaf.nu/articles/Guidance_Documents/31|title=IAF Guidance Documents|first=|last=elva|date=5 October 2015|work=iaf.nu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of some certification schemes include the Safety Equipment Institute for protective headgear, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) Telecommunication Certification Body (TCB) program for radio communication devices, the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] [[Energy Star]] program, the [[IECEE|International Commission on the Rules for the Approval of Electrical Equipment]] Product Safety Certification Body Scheme (IEECE CB Scheme), MAS (Materials Analytical Services) Certified Green IEQ program, and the [[Greenguard Environmental Institute]] Indoor Air Quality program. Certification schemes are typically written to include both the performance test methods that the product must be tested to, as well as the criteria that the product must meet to become Certified.&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC Guide 28:2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Certifications (and the certificates that document their existence) are often called "certs" in the everyday jargon of various industries.

Also [http://automationkingz.com/worldwide-electrical-certifications/ Electrical certifications] are very important for professionals. If you are pursuing any degree/diploma in electrical or Automation domain. Here are [http://automationkingz.com/worldwide-electrical-certifications/ Worldwide Accepted Electrical Certifications and Standards list].

==Certification process==
A product might be [[verification and validation|verified]] to comply with a specification or stamped with a specification number.  This does not, by itself, indicate that the item is fit for any particular use.  The person or group of persons who own the certification scheme (i.e., engineers, trade unions, building code writers, government, industry, etc.) have the responsibility to consider the choice of available specifications, choose the correct ones, set qualification limits, and enforce compliance with those limits.  The end users of the product have the responsibility to use the item correctly. Products must be [[listing and approval use and compliance|used in accordance]] with their listing for certification to be effective.

Product certification is often required in sensitive industry and marketplace areas where a failure could have serious consequences, such as negatively affecting the health and welfare of the people or person using that product.  For example, certification is stringent in [[aerospace]] applications, since the demands for low weight tend to lead to high stress on components, requiring appropriate [[metallurgy]] and accuracy in [[manufacturing]].  Other sensitive product area examples include [[food]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, [[healthcare]] products, [[dangerous goods]], and products that have [[Radio Frequency|RF emissions]] such as computers and cellular telephones.

The process for certification of a product is generally summed up in four steps:

* Application (including testing of the product)
* Evaluation (does the test data indicate that the product meets qualification criteria)
* Decision (does a second review of the product application concur with the Evaluation)
* Surveillance (does the product in the marketplace continue to meet qualification criteria)

In many instances, prior to applying for certification, a product supplier will send a product to a testing laboratory (some certification schemes require the product to be sent out for testing by the product certifier instead).  When the product to be certified is received at the testing laboratory, it is tested in accordance with the laboratory's internal procedures and with the methods listed in the test standards specified by the certification scheme.  The resulting data collected by the testing laboratory, and is then forwarded either back to the manufacturer, or directly to the product certifier.

The product certifier then reviews the product supplier's application information, including the testing data.&lt;ref name=Guide65 /&gt;  If the certifier's evaluation&lt;ref name=Guide65 /&gt; concludes that the test data shows that the product meets all required criteria as listed in the certification scheme, and the decision maker(s) of the product certifier concur with the evaluation,&lt;ref name=Guide65 /&gt; then the product is deemed "certified" and is listed in a directory that the Product certifier is required to keep.&lt;ref name=Guide65 /&gt;  ISO Guide 65 requires&lt;ref name=Guide65 /&gt; that the final decision to grant or not grant certification be made only by a person or group of persons not involved in the evaluation of the product.

Products often need periodic recertification, also known as surveillance.  This requirement is typically identified within the certification scheme that the product is certified to.  Certification bodies may require product suppliers to perform some sort of surveillance activity,&lt;ref name=Guide65 /&gt; such as pulling sample products from the marketplace for testing,&lt;ref&gt;EPA ENERGY STAR Program, Conditions and Criteria for Recognition of Certification Bodies, Section 3 [http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/downloads/mou/Conditions_and_Criteria_for_Recognition_of_Certification_Bodies.pdf?e51d-6631]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FCC&gt;FCC Telecommunication Certification Body (TCB) Program Roles and Responsibilities, Section 23 [http://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/kdb/forms/FTSSearchResultPage.cfm?id=44683&amp;switch=P]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to maintain their "listed" or "certified" status. Other examples of Surveillance activities include surprise audits of the manufacturing plant, supervision of the manufacturing and/or testing process,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbscheme.com%2FOperational_documents%2Fiecee_documents%2Fod-2029_ed.1.2.pdf&amp;ei=THp0T57mNKPi0QHhh7z_Ag&amp;usg=AFQjCNHnKM9PGjZtqtjbGiH07czo8kHR7g&amp;sig2=9VHI5qC5Dd9ppx0XghqzIA IECEE OD-2029-Ed.1.2]&lt;/ref&gt; or a simple paperwork submittal from the supplier to the product certifier to ensure that the certified product has not changed. Other causes for recertification may include complaints issued against the product's functionality, which would require removal from the marketplace, and expiration of the original certification. These lists of examples are by no means all inclusive.

Some certification schemes, or the product certifiers that operate those Schemes, may require that the product supplier operate a [[Quality Management System]] registered to [[ISO 9000]], or that the testing be performed by a laboratory [[accredited]] to [[ISO 17025]].&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 17025:2005&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to set these requirements is most often made by the person or group which owns the Certification Scheme.

==Certification marks and listings of certified products==
{{main|Certification mark|certification listing}}
Certified products are typically endorsed with a [[certification mark]] provided by the product certifier. Issuance of a certification mark is at the discretion of the individual product certifier. ISO Guide 65 does not require the product certifier to offer a certification mark in the event that a certificate is offered.  When certification marks are issued and used on products, they are usually easy to see and enable users to track down the [[certification listing]]s to determine the criteria that the product meets, and whether or not the listing is still active.

An active [[certification listing]] must minimally include indication of&lt;ref name=Guide65 /&gt; the following information:
* The specific product or type of product certified
* The qualification standard that the product is judged to meet
* The date of certification (and if applicable, its expiration)

Product certifiers may choose to include much more information than that listed above, but ISO Guide 65 specifies the bare minimum which must be made available regarding the certification status of a product.

These listings are typically used by an Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ), such as a municipal building inspector, fire prevention officer, or electrical inspector, to compare the product's use or installation with the intent of the rating by testing. In order to comply with the code, the product listing must be "active", as products and companies can become "de-listed" due to re-testing showing that a product no longer meets qualification criteria, or a business decision by the manufacturer.

The widespread availability of the Internet has led to a new kind of certification for websites. Website certifications exist to certify the website's [[privacy policy]], [[security]] of their [[financial transaction]]s, suitability for [[minor (law)|minors]], among many other acceptability characteristics.  In [[broadcast engineering]], [[transmitter]]s and [[radio antenna]]s often must by certified by the country's [[broadcasting authority]].  In the United States, this certification was once called "type acceptance" by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), and applied to most services except [[amateur radio]] due to its inherent [[amateur radio homebrew|homebrew]] nature.  Today the FCC requires&lt;ref name=FCC /&gt; all testing of transmitters and antennas to be performed in a laboratory accredited to ISO 17025, with that laboratory being part of the overall organization that houses the Product Certification Body (TCB).

==Accreditation bodies==
The [[International Accreditation Forum]] (IAF) has a listing of all recognized Accreditation Bodies whose accreditations to the ISO Guide 65 standard are deemed equivalent. From the IAF MLA informational page:&lt;ref name="IAF_MLA"/&gt;

:"IAF is encouraging more of its members to join the MLA as soon as they have passed a rigorous evaluation process to ensure that their accreditation programs are of world standard.  The consequence of joining the IAF MLA is that conformity assessment certificates issued, within the scope of the IAF MLA, by conformity assessment bodies accredited by any one of the members of the IAF MLA will be recognised in the world wide IAF program."

Most countries only have a single Accreditation Body representing their economy in the IAF MLA.  The two exceptions are the United States with [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI), American National Standards Institute - American Society for Quality National Accreditation Board (ANAB, a subdivision of ANSI), American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA), and International Accreditation Service (IAS) as signatory members, and United Accreditation Foundation as Full Member of IAF (International Accreditation Forum) Europe with Germany's [[Technischer Überwachungsverein]] (TÜV), and Korea which is represented by Korea Accreditation Board (KAB) and Korean Accreditation System (KAS).  These listings are current as of March 2012, but will likely change in the future as more Accreditation Bodies undergo the required peer evaluations in order to become signatory members of the MLA.

Each Accreditation Body is required to keep a listing of those organizations it accredits, as well as a Scope of Accreditation which details the activities that the organizations can perform, whether that be testing, inspection, or product certification.&lt;ref name=ISO17011 /&gt;

Accreditation Bodies routinely [[audit]]&lt;ref name=ISO17011 /&gt; the Product Certifiers whom they have accredited in order to determine if the performance or actions of the organization have changed and do not meet the requirements of the Accreditation Body and the International Standards they are to conform to.

Its not mandatory for each Accreditation Bodies to be member of IAF or to join IAF in any manner, there have been several accreditation Board like AB-CAB, ESMA, NACI etc.

==European Economic Area== 
Within the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA), the majority of products are required to be ‘[[CE_marking|CE Marked]]’ and will have the letter CE on them. It shows that the manufacturer or importer has checked that these products meet EU safety, health or environmental requirements; is an indicator of a product’s compliance with EU legislation and allows the free movement of products within the European market.

By placing the CE marking on a product, a manufacturer or importer is declaring, on his sole responsibility, conformity with all of the legal requirements to achieve CE marking. The manufacturer is thus ensuring validity for that product to be sold throughout the EEA. This also applies to products made in third countries which are sold in the EEA and Turkey.

If you are a manufacturer it is your responsibility to:

* carry out the conformity assessment (including any testing, if required)
* set up the technical file
* issue the EC Declaration of Conformity (DoC)
* place CE marking on a product

If you are a distributor you must check the presence of both the CE marking and the necessary supporting documentation.

If you are importing a product that is from a third country you have to check that the manufacturer outside the EU has undertaken the necessary steps. You must check that the documentation is available.
The Europa website gives details various product categories and the relevant EU directives to which products must conform.

==International applications==
{{original research|section|date=August 2015}}
North America's nuclear industry is exempt from mandatory certification{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.  This has allowed situations leading to large amounts of remedial work, especially for [[fireproofing]] of electrical circuits ([[circuit integrity]]) between nuclear reactor and control rooms in the U.S.  In this case, submitors were permitted to dictate not only their test procedures, but also to construct test specimens in their own facilities, prior to fire tests on the part of laboratories.  The primary example of this situation is the [[Thermo-Lag scandal]], which came about as a result of disclosures by [[whistleblower]] [[Gerald W. Brown]] to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] as well as watchdog groups, members of US Congress, and the press.

In Germany, the accredited testing organizations routinely audit manufacturing locations and submit quality control test results to DIBt. While the German laboratories do not possess process standards, their methodology can uncover changes in the nature and quality of ingredients, as DIBt establishes very clear tolerances for performance{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.

Where product certification is optional, one must rely on the [[ethics]] of the manufacturer{{whom|date=August 2015}} that the item being sold is identical to the item that was tested, and that the item that was tested was in fact installed the way the test report reads. The test report by itself also does not afford its bona fide interpretation in terms of the tolerances that a certification listing would provide.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

'''''Rising Sun''''' is a 1993 American [[crime film]] written and directed by [[Philip Kaufman]], starring [[Sean Connery]] (who was also an executive producer), [[Wesley Snipes]], [[Harvey Keitel]], and [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]]. [[Michael Crichton]] and Michael Backes wrote the screenplay, based on Crichton's [[Rising Sun (novel)|novel of the same name]].&lt;ref name="WVrev"&gt;''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; August 2, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
During a commencement gala at the newly opened Los Angeles headquarters of Nakamoto, a Japanese [[keiretsu]], a [[call girl]] named Cheryl Lynn Austin, is found dead, apparently after a violent sexual encounter. Police Detectives Webster "Web" Smith and John Connor, a former police captain and expert on Japanese affairs, are sent to act as liaison between the Japanese executives and the investigating officer, Smith's former partner Tom Graham. During the initial investigation, Connor and Smith review surveillance camera footage, and realize that one of the discs is missing.

Smith and Connor suspect Eddie Sakamura, Cheryl's [[yakuza]] boyfriend, of killing her, and interrogate him at a house party. Sakamura promises to bring Connor something, and Connor reluctantly lets him go after confiscating his passport. Ishihara, a Nakamoto employee whom Connor had previously interrogated, delivers the missing disc, which clearly shows Sakamura killing Cheryl. Graham and Smith lead a SWAT raid on Sakamura's house. He tries to flee in a sports car, but crashes and is killed.

Smith learns that Sakamura had attempted to contact him about the missing disc, so he and Connor take the disc to an expert, Jingo Asakuma, who reveals that the disc has been digitally altered to implicate Sakamura. 

Nakamoto is in the midst of sensitive negotiations for the acquisition of an American [[Semiconductor industry|semiconductor company]], with Senator John Morton, a guest at the party, abruptly changing his stance on a bill that would prevent the merger from going through. Suspecting his sudden shift is somehow related to the murder, Connor and Smith attempt to interview him at his campaign office, but without success. Upon returning to Smith's apartment, the duo find Sakamura alive and well. He reveals that he was being tailed that day by Tanaka, a Nakamoto security agent attempting to locate the original disc. Not wanting to be seen with Sakamura, Tanaka stole his sports car and committed suicide by crashing it. Sakamura gives Connor the original disc, but before he can leave, Lt. Graham arrives with Ishihara. Sakamura is killed fighting off Ishihara's men, and Smith is shot and left for dead, surviving only thanks to a bulletproof vest.

After being interrogated, Smith is put on paid leave due to an ongoing investigation of an earlier corruption charge. Regrouping with Connor and Jingo, the three view the original surveillance footage, which shows Senator Morton performing [[erotic asphyxiation]] on Cheryl. Falsely believing he killed her, Morton changes his position on the regulation bill to stay in Nakamoto's good graces. After leaving the boardroom, the footage shows another figure approaching and killing Cheryl by strangulation.

Hoping to draw the killer out, Connor and Smith fax Morton stills of the footage showing his involvement in the murder. Morton contacts Ishihara, revealing the executive to be in on the cover-up, and then Morton commits suicide. Connor, Smith, and Jingo interrupt the merger negotiations to show Nakamoto President Yoshida the surveillance footage. Bob Richmond, an American lawyer working for Nakamoto, reveals himself as the killer and tries to run away, only to be killed by Sakamura's friends.

Yoshida maintains his and his colleagues innocence, quietly exiling Ishihara to a desk job back in Japan. Smith drives Jingo home, where she casts doubt on whether Richmond was really the murderer, or if he was simply taking the fall to protect someone higher up in the company.

The '''theory of constraints''' ('''TOC''') is a management paradigm  that views any manageable system as being limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of [[Theory of constraints#Constraints|constraints]]. There is always at least one constraint, and TOC uses [[#The five focusing steps|a focusing process]] to identify the constraint and restructure the rest of the organization around it. TOC adopts the common idiom "a chain is no stronger than its weakest link". This means that processes, organizations, etc., are vulnerable because the weakest person or part can always damage or break them or at least adversely affect the outcome.

The theory of constraints (TOC) is an overall [[management philosophy]] introduced by [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] in his 1984 book titled ''[[The Goal (novel)|The Goal]]'', that is geared to help organizations continually achieve their goals.&lt;ref name=goal&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cox, Jeff |author2=Goldratt, Eliyahu M. |title=The goal: a process of ongoing improvement |publisher=North River Press |location=[Croton-on-Hudson, NY] |year=1986 |pages= |isbn=0-88427-061-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldratt adapted the concept to project management with his book ''Critical Chain'', published in 1997.

An earlier propagator of a similar concept was Wolfgang Mewes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfgangmewes.de/wm.htm|title=Beratergruppe Strategie|author=|date=|website=www.wolfgangmewes.de|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany with publications on ''power-oriented management theory'' (Machtorientierte Führungstheorie, 1963) and following with his ''Energo-Kybernetic System (EKS, 1971)'', later renamed ''[[:de:Engpasskonzentrierte Strategie|Engpasskonzentrierte Strategie]]'' (Bottleneck-focused Strategy) as a more advanced ''theory of bottlenecks''. The publications of Wolfgang Mewes are marketed through the FAZ Verlag, publishing house of the German newspaper ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'' (Frankfurt General Newspaper). However, the paradigm ''Theory of constraints'' was first used by Goldratt.

===Key assumption===
The underlying premise of the theory of constraints is that organizations can be measured and controlled by variations on three measures: throughput, operational expense, and inventory. Inventory is all the money that the system has invested in purchasing things which it intends to sell. Operational expense is all the money the system spends in order to turn inventory into throughput. Throughput is the rate at which the system generates money through sales.&lt;ref name=essays&gt;{{cite book |author=Goldratt, Eliyahu M. |title=Essays on the ''Theory of Constraints'' |publisher=North River Press |location=[Great Barrington, MA] |pages= |isbn=0-88427-159-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the goal itself can be reached, necessary conditions must first be met. These typically include safety, quality, legal obligations, etc.  For most businesses, the goal itself is to make money.  However, for many organizations and non-profit businesses, making money is a necessary condition for pursuing the goal.  Whether it is the goal or a necessary condition, understanding how to make sound financial decisions based on throughput, inventory, and operating expense is a critical requirement.&lt;ref name=essays /&gt;

===The five focusing steps===
Theory of constraints is based on the premise that the rate of [[goal]] achievement by a goal-oriented [[system]] (i.e., the system's [[Throughput (business)|throughput]]) is limited by at least one [[Theory of constraints#Constraints|constraint]].

The argument by [[reductio ad absurdum]] is as follows: If there was nothing preventing a system from achieving higher throughput (i.e., more goal units in a unit of time), its throughput would be infinite — which is impossible in a real-life system.

Only by increasing flow through the constraint can overall throughput be increased.&lt;ref name=goal/&gt;

Assuming the goal of a system has been articulated and its measurements defined, the steps are:

# Identify the system's constraint(s).
# Decide how to exploit the system's constraint(s).
# Subordinate everything else to the above decision(s).
# Alleviate the system's constraint(s).
# Warning! If in the previous steps a [[Theory of constraints#Breaking a constraint|constraint has been broken]], go back to step 1, but do not allow [[inertia]] to cause a system's constraint.&lt;ref&gt;Eliyahu M. Goldratt. 2004. _The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement, {{ISBN|978-0-88427-178-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of a commercial organization is: "Make more money now and in the future",&lt;ref&gt;Theory of Constraints Handbook, {{ISBN|978-0-07-166554-4}}, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and its measurements are given by [[throughput accounting]] as: throughput, [[inventory]], and [[operating expenses]].

The five focusing steps aim to ensure ongoing improvement efforts are centered on the organization's constraint(s).  In the TOC literature, this is referred to as the ''[[Continual improvement process|process of ongoing improvement]]'' (POOGI).

These focusing steps are the key steps to developing the specific [[#Applications|applications]] mentioned below.

===Constraints===
A constraint is anything that prevents the system from achieving its goal. There are many ways that constraints can show up, but a core principle within TOC is that there are not tens or hundreds of constraints. There is at least one, but at most only a few in any given system. Constraints can be internal or external to the system. An internal constraint is in evidence when the market demands more from the system than it can deliver. If this is the case, then the focus of the organization should be on discovering that constraint and following the five focusing steps to open it up (and potentially remove it). An external constraint exists when the system can produce more than the market will bear. If this is the case, then the organization should focus on mechanisms to create more demand for its products or services.

Types of (internal) constraints
* Equipment: The way equipment is currently used limits the ability of the system to produce more salable goods/services.
* People: Lack of skilled people limits the system. Mental models held by people can cause behaviour that becomes a constraint.
* Policy: A written or unwritten policy prevents the system from making more.

The concept of the constraint in Theory of Constraints is analogous to but differs from the [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]] that shows up in mathematical [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. In TOC, the constraint is used as a focusing mechanism for management of the system.  In optimization, the constraint is written into the mathematical expressions to limit the scope of the solution (X can be no greater than 5).

Please note: organizations have many problems with equipment, people, policies, etc. (A breakdown is just that – a breakdown – and is not a constraint in the true sense of the TOC concept). The constraint is the [[limiting factor]] that is preventing the organization from getting more throughput (typically, revenue through sales) even when nothing goes wrong.

===Breaking a constraint===
If a constraint's throughput capacity is elevated to the point where it is no longer the system's limiting factor, this is said to "break" the constraint. The limiting factor is now some other part of the system, or may be external to the system (an external constraint). This is not to be confused with a breakdown.

===Buffers===
Buffers are used throughout the theory of constraints. They often result as part of the exploit and subordinate steps of the five focusing steps. Buffers are placed before the governing constraint, thus ensuring that the constraint is never starved. Buffers are also placed behind the constraint to prevent downstream failure from blocking the constraint's output. Buffers used in this way protect the constraint from variations in the rest of the system and should allow for normal variation of processing time and the occasional upset ([[Murphy's Law|Murphy]]) before and behind the constraint.

Buffers can be a bank of physical objects before a work center, waiting to be processed by that work center. Buffers ultimately buy you time, as in the time before work reaches the constraint and are often verbalized as time buffers. There should always be enough (but not excessive) work in the time queue before the constraint and adequate offloading space behind the constraint.

Buffers are ''not'' the small queue of work that sits before every work center in a [[Kanban]] system although it is similar if you regard the assembly line as the governing constraint. A prerequisite in the theory is that with one constraint in the system, all other parts of the system must have sufficient capacity to keep up with the work at the constraint and to catch up if time was lost. In a balanced line, as espoused by Kanban, when one work center goes down for a period longer than the buffer allows, then the entire system must wait until that work center is restored. In a TOC system, the only situation where work is in danger is if the constraint is unable to process (either due to malfunction, sickness or a "hole" in the buffer – if something goes wrong that the time buffer can not protect).

Buffer management, therefore, represents a crucial attribute of the theory of constraints. There are many ways to apply buffers, but the most often used is a visual system of designating the buffer in three colors: green (okay), yellow (caution) and red (action required). Creating this kind of visibility enables the system as a whole to align and thus subordinate to the need of the constraint in a holistic manner. This can also be done daily in a central operations room that is accessible to everybody.

===Plant types===
There are four primary types of plants in the TOC lexicon. Draw the flow of material from the bottom of a page to the top, and you get the four types. They specify the general flow of materials through a system, and also provide some hints about where to look for typical problems. This type of analysis is known as VATI analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=APICS Dictionary, 13th Edition|last=Blackstone, Jr., editor|first=John H.|publisher=APICS self-published|year=2013|isbn=978-0-9882146-1-3|location=Chicago|pages=186|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it uses the bottom-up shapes of the letters V, A, T, and I to describe the types of plants. The four types can be combined in many ways in larger facilities, e.g. "an A plant feeding a V plant".
* V-plant: The general flow of material is one-to-many, such as a plant that takes one raw material and can make many final products.  Classic examples are meat rendering plants or a steel manufacturer. The primary problem in V-plants is "robbing," where one operation (A) immediately after a diverging point "steals" materials meant for the other operation (B). Once the material has been processed by A, it cannot come back and be run through B without significant rework.
* A-plant: The general flow of material is many-to-one, such as in a plant where many sub-assemblies converge for a final assembly. The primary problem in A-plants is in synchronizing the converging lines so that each supplies the final assembly point at the right time.
* T-plant: The general flow is that of an I-plant (or has multiple lines), which then splits into many assemblies (many-to-many). Most manufactured parts are used in multiple assemblies and nearly all assemblies use multiple parts. Customized devices, such as computers, are good examples. T-plants suffer from both synchronization problems of A-plants (parts aren't all available for an assembly) and the robbing problems of V-plants (one assembly steals parts that could have been used in another).
* I-plant: Material flows in a sequence, such as in an assembly line. The primary work is done in a straight sequence of events (one-to-one). The constraint is the slowest operation.

From the above list, one can deduce that for non-material systems one could draw the flow of work or the flow of processes, instead of physical flows, and arrive at similar basic V, A, T, or I structures. A project, for example, is an A-shaped sequence of work, culminating in a delivered product (''i.e., the intended outcome of the project'').

==Applications==
The focusing steps, this process of ongoing improvement, have been applied to [[manufacturing]], [[project management]], supply chain/distribution generated specific solutions. Other tools (mainly the "thinking process") also led to TOC applications in the fields of [[marketing]] and [[sales]], and [[finance]].  The solution as applied to each of these areas are listed below.

===Operations===
Within manufacturing operations and [[operations management]], the solution seeks to pull materials through the system, rather than push them into the system. The primary methodology used is drum-buffer-rope (DBR)&lt;ref name=race&gt;{{cite book |author1=Goldratt, Eliyahu |author2=Fox, Robert |title=The Race |publisher=North River Press |location=[Croton-on-Hudson, NY] |year=1986 |pages=179 |isbn=978-0-88427-062-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a variation called simplified drum-buffer-rope (S-DBR).&lt;ref name=sdbr&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Eli Schragenheim  |author2=H. William Dettmer  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Simplified Drum-Buffer-Rope: A Whole System Approach to High Velocity Manufacturing | year=  2000 | url = http://www.goalsys.com/books/documents/S-DBRPaper.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2007-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drum-buffer-rope is a manufacturing execution methodology based on the fact the output of a system can only be the same as the output at the constraint of the system. Any attempt to produce more than what the constraint can process just leads to excess inventory piling up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Race|last=Goldratt|first=Eliyahu M.|publisher=North River Press|year=1986|isbn=9780884270621|location=Croton-on Hudson, New York|pages=77–97|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method is named for its three components. The ''drum'' is the rate at which the physical constraint of the plant can work: the work center or machine or operation that limits the ability of the entire system to produce more. The rest of the plant follows the beat of the drum. Schedule at the drum decides what the system should produce, in what sequence to produce and how much to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldratt|first1=Eliyahu|title=The Haystack Syndrome:: Sifting Information out of the Data Ocean|date=1990|publisher=New York: North River Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; They make sure the drum has work and that anything the drum has processed does not get wasted.

The ''buffer'' protects the drum, so that it always has work flowing to it. Buffers in DBR provide the additional lead time beyond the required set up and process times, for materials in the product flow. Since these buffers have time as their unit of measure, rather than quantity of material, this makes the priority system operate strictly based on the time an order is expected to be at the drum. Each work order will have a remaining buffer status that can be calculated. Based on this buffer status, work orders can be color coded into Red, Yellow and Green. The red orders have the highest priority and must be worked on first, since they have penetrated most into their buffers followed by yellow and green. As time evolves, this buffer status might change and the color assigned to the particular work order change with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shri Shrikanth|first1=M|title=DBR, Buffer Management, and VATI flow classification|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=J. F. Cox III &amp; J. J. Schleier|title=Theory of Constraints Handbook|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|pages=175–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional DBR usually calls for buffers at several points in the system: the constraint, synchronization points and at shipping. S-DBR has a buffer at shipping and manages the flow of work across the drum through a load planning mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schragenheim|first1=e|last2=Dettmer|first2=H. W|last3=Patterson|first3=J. W.|title=Supply Chain Management at Warp Speed|date=2009|publisher=Auerbach publications|location=Boca Raton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''rope'' is the work release mechanism for the plant. Orders are released to the shop floor at one "buffer time" before they are due to be processed by the constraint. In other words, if the buffer is 5 days, the order is released 5 days before it is due at the constraint. Putting work into the system earlier than this buffer time is likely to generate too-high work-in-process and slow down the entire system.&lt;ref name="International Journal of Production Research"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=G. R.|last2=Fry|first2=T. D|title=Order review/release and lot splitting in drum-buffer-rope|date=1997|pages=35:827–845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-speed automated production lines===
Automated production lines that are used in the beverage industry to fill containers usually have several machines executing parts of the complete process, from filling primary containers to secondary packaging and palletisation. These machines operate at different speeds and capacities and have varying efficiency levels.

To be able to maximize the throughput, the production line usually has a designed constraint. This constraint is typically the slowest and often the most expensive machine on the line. The overall throughput of the line is determined by this machine. All other machines can operate faster and are connected by conveyors.

The conveyors usually have the ability to buffer product. In the event of a stoppage at a machine other than the constraint, the conveyor can buffer the product enabling the constraint machine to keep on running.

A typical line setup is such that in normal operation the upstream conveyors from the constraint machine are always run full to prevent starvation at the constraint and the downstream conveyors are run empty to prevent a back up at the constraint. The overall aim is to prevent minor stoppages at the machines from impacting the constraint.

For this reason as the machines get further from the constraint, they have the ability to run faster than the previous machine and this creates a V curve.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Supply chain and logistics===
In general, the solution for supply chains is to create flow of inventory so as to ensure greater availability and to eliminate surpluses.

The TOC distribution solution is effective when used to address a single link in the supply chain and more so across the entire system, even if that system comprises many different companies. The purpose of the TOC distribution solution is to establish a decisive competitive edge based on extraordinary availability by dramatically reducing the damages caused when the flow of goods is interrupted by shortages and surpluses.

This approach uses several new rules to protect availability with less inventory than is conventionally required. Before explaining these new rules, the term Replenishment Time must be defined. Replenishment Time (RT) is the sum of the delay, after the first consumption following a delivery, before an order is placed plus the delay after the order is placed until the ordered goods arrive at the ordering location.

# Inventory is held at an aggregation point(s) as close as possible to the source. This approach ensures smoothed demand at the aggregation point, requiring proportionally less inventory. The distribution centers holding the aggregated stock are able to ship goods downstream to the next link in the supply chain much more quickly than a make-to-order manufacturer can.
# Following this rule may result in a make-to-order manufacturer converting to make-to-stock.  The inventory added at the aggregation point is significantly less than the inventory reduction downstream.
# In all stocking locations, initial inventory buffers are set which effectively create an upper limit of the inventory at that location. The buffer size is equal to the maximum expected consumption within the average RT, plus additional stock to protect in case a delivery is late. In other words, there is no advantage in holding more inventory in a location than the amount that might be consumed before more could be ordered and received. Typically, the sum of the on hand value of such buffers are 25–75% less than currently observed average inventory levels.
# Once buffers have been established, no replenishment orders are placed as long as the quantity inbound (already ordered but not yet received) plus the quantity on hand are equal to or greater than the buffer size. Following this rule causes surplus inventory to be bled off as it is consumed.
# For any reason, when on hand plus inbound inventory is less than the buffer, orders are placed as soon as practical to increase the inbound inventory so that the relationship On Hand + Inbound = Buffer is maintained.
# To ensure buffers remain correctly sized even with changes in the rates of demand and replenishment, a simple recursive algorithm called Buffer Management is used.  When the on hand inventory level is in the upper third of the buffer for a full RT, the buffer is reduced by one third (and don’t forget rule 3).  Alternatively, when the on hand inventory is in the bottom one third of the buffer for too long, the buffer is increased by one third (and don’t forget rule 4).  The definition of “too long” may be changed depending on required service levels, however, a rule of thumb is 20% of the RT. Moving buffers up more readily than down is supported by the usually greater damage caused by shortages as compared to the damage caused by surpluses.

Once inventory is managed as described above, continuous efforts should be undertaken to reduce RT, late deliveries, supplier minimum order quantities (both per SKU and per order) and customer order batching. Any improvements in these areas will automatically improve both availability and inventory turns, thanks to the adaptive nature of Buffer Management.

A stocking location that manages inventory according to the TOC should help a non-TOC customer (downstream link in a supply chain, whether internal or external) manage their inventory according to the TOC process. This type of help can take the form of a vendor managed inventory (VMI). The TOC distribution link simply extends its buffer sizing and management techniques to its customers’ inventories. Doing so has the effect of smoothing the demand from the customer and reducing order sizes per SKU. VMI results in better availability and inventory turns for both supplier and customer. More than that, the benefits to the non-TOC customers are sufficient to meet the purpose of capitalizing on the decisive competitive edge by giving the customer a powerful reason to be more loyal and give more business to the upstream link. When the end consumers buy more, the whole supply chain sells more.

One caveat should be considered. Initially and only temporarily, the supply chain or a specific link may sell less as the surplus inventory in the system is sold.  However, the sales lift due to improved availability is a countervailing factor. The current levels of surpluses and shortages make each case different.

===Finance and accounting===
The solution for finance and accounting is to apply holistic thinking to the finance application. This has been termed [[throughput accounting]].&lt;ref name=tpa&gt;{{cite book |author=Corbett, Thomas |title=Throughput Accounting |publisher=North River Press |year=1998 |pages=160 |isbn=978-0-88427-158-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughput accounting suggests that one examine the impact of investments and operational changes in terms of the impact on the throughput of the business.  It is an alternative to [[cost accounting]].

The primary measures for a TOC view of finance and accounting are: throughput, operating expense and investment. Throughput is calculated from sales minus "totally variable cost", where totally variable cost is usually calculated as the cost of raw materials that go into creating the item sold.&lt;ref name=tocma&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=13–14}}

===Project management===
[[Critical Chain Project Management]] (CCPM) are utilized in this area.&lt;ref name=criticalchain&gt;{{cite book |author=Goldratt, Eliyahu M. |title=Critical Chain |publisher=North River Press |location=Great Barrington, MA |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=0-88427-153-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CCPM is based on the idea that all projects look like A-plants: all activities converge to a final deliverable. As such, to protect the project, there must be internal buffers to protect synchronization points and a final project buffer to protect the overall project.

===Marketing and sales===
While originally focused on manufacturing and logistics, TOC has expanded lately into sales management and marketing. Its role is explicitly acknowledged in the field of [[sales process engineering]].&lt;ref name="Selden"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sales Process Engineering: A Personal Workshop |author = Paul H. Selden|publisher=ASQ Quality Press|location = Milwaukee, WI|year=1997|pages =33–35, 264–268|isbn=0-87389-418-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For effective sales management one can apply Drum Buffer Rope to the sales process similar to the way it is applied to operations (see Reengineering the Sales Process book reference below). This technique is appropriate when your constraint is in the sales process itself, or if you just want an effective sales management technique which includes the topics of funnel management and conversion rates.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Thinking processes==
{{main|Thinking processes (theory of constraints)}}
The thinking processes are a set of tools to help managers walk through the steps of initiating and implementing a project. When used in a logical flow, the thinking processes help walk through a buy-in process:
# Gain agreement on the problem
# Gain agreement on the direction for a solution
# Gain agreement that the solution solves the problem
# Agree to overcome any potential negative ramifications
# Agree to overcome any obstacles to implementation

TOC practitioners sometimes refer to these in the negative as working through ''layers of resistance'' to a change.

Recently, the ''[[Current reality tree (theory of constraints)|current reality tree]]'' (CRT) and ''future reality tree'' (FRT) have been applied to an argumentative academic paper.&lt;ref&gt;See the annex of: Vidal, C. 2008.[https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1087 The Future of Scientific Simulations: from Artificial Life to Artificial Cosmogenesis]. In Death And Anti-Death , ed. Charles Tandy, 6: Thirty Years After Kurt Gödel (1906–1978) pp. 285-318. Ria University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its origins as a manufacturing approach (Goldratt &amp; Cox, The Goal: A process of Ongoing Improvement, 1992), Goldratt's Theory of Constraints (TOC) methodology is now regarded as a systems methodology with strong foundations in the hard sciences (Mabin, 1999). Through its tools for convergent thinking and synthesis, the “Thinking processes”, which underpin the entire TOC methodology, help identify and manage constraints and guide continuous improvement and change in organizations (Dettmer H. , 1998).

The process of change requires the identification and acceptance of core issues; the goal and the means to the goal. This comprehensive set of logical tools can be used for exploration, solution development and solution implementation for individuals, groups or organizations. Each tool has a purpose and nearly all tools can be used independently (Cox &amp; Spencer, 1998). Since these thinking tools are designed to address successive “layers of resistance” and enable communication, it expedites securing “buy in” of groups. While CRT (current reality tree) represents the undesirable effects of the current situation, the FRT (the future reality tree), NBR (negative branch) help people plan and understand the possible results of their actions. The PRT (prerequisite tree) and TRT (transition tree) are designed to build collective buy in and aid in the Implementation phase. The logical constructs of these tools or diagrams are the necessary condition logic, the sufficient cause logic and the strict logic rules that are used to validate cause-effect relationships which are modelled with these tools (Dettmer W. , 2006).

A summary of these tools, the questions they help answer and the associated logical constructs used is presented in the table below.

'''TOC Thinking Process Tools:'''
Use of these tools are based on the fundamental beliefs of TOC that organizations a) are inherently simple (interdependencies exist in organizations) b) desire inherent harmony (win – win solutions are possible) c) are inherently good (people are good) and have inherent potential (people and organizations have potential to do better) (Goldratt E. , 2009). In the book “Through the clouds to solutions” Jelena Fedurko (Fedurko, 2013) states that the major areas for application of TP tools as:
* To create and enhance thinking and learning skills
* To make better decisions
* To develop responsibility for one’s own actions through understanding their consequences
* To handle conflicts with more confidence and win-win outcomes
* To correct behavior with undesirable consequences
* Assist in evaluating conditions for achieving a desired outcome
* To assist in peer mediation
* To assist in relationship between subordinates and bosses{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Development and practice==
TOC was initiated by Goldratt, who until his recent death was still the main driving force behind the development and practice of TOC. There is a network of individuals and small companies loosely coupled as practitioners around the world. TOC is sometimes referred to as "constraint management". TOC is a large body of knowledge with a strong guiding philosophy of growth.

==Criticism==
Criticisms that have been leveled against TOC include:

===Claimed suboptimality of drum-buffer-rope===
While TOC has been compared favorably to linear programming techniques,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; D.

says that TOC borrows heavily from [[System dynamics|systems dynamics]] developed by [[Jay Forrester|Forrester]] in the 1950s and from [[statistical process control]] which dates back to World War II. And Noreen Smith and Mackey, in their independent report on TOC, point out that several key concepts in TOC "have been topics in management accounting textbooks for decades."&lt;ref name=tocma/&gt;{{rp|page=149}}

People claim{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Goldratt's books fail to acknowledge that TOC borrows from more than 40 years of previous management science research and practice, particularly from [[program evaluation and review technique]]/[[critical path method]] (PERT/CPM) and the [[Just-in-time (business)|just in time]] strategy. A rebuttal to these criticisms is offered in Goldratt's "What is the ''Theory of Constraints'' and How Should it be Implemented?", and in his audio program, "Beyond The Goal". In these, Goldratt discusses the history of disciplinary sciences, compares the strengths and weaknesses of the various disciplines, and acknowledges the sources of information and inspiration for the thinking processes and critical chain methodologies. Articles published in the now-defunct Journal of ''Theory of Constraints'' referenced foundational materials. Goldratt published an article&lt;ref name=giants&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldratt|first1=Eliyahu M.|title=Standing on the shoulders of giants: production concepts versus production applications. The Hitachi Tool Engineering example.|journal=Gestão &amp; produção|date=2009|volume=16|issue=3|pages=333–343|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0104-530X2009000300002&amp;script=sci_arttext|accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gave talks&lt;ref name=giantsvideo&gt;{{cite video |author=Eliyahu Goldratt | title=Standing on the Shoulders of Giants | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3RPFUh3ePQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the title "Standing on the Shoulders of Giants" in which he gives credit for many of the core ideas of Theory of Constraints. Goldratt has sought many times to show the correlation between various improvement methods.

Goldratt has been criticized on lack of openness in his theories, an example being him not releasing the algorithm he used for the Optimum Performance Training system.&lt;ref name=rahman1998&gt;Rahman, Shams-ur. "Theory of constraints: a review of the philosophy and its applications." International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management 18.4 (1998): 336-355.
&lt;/ref&gt; Some view him as unscientific with many of his theories, tools and techniques not being a part of the public domain, rather a part of his own framework of profiting on his ideas.
According to Gupta and Snyder (2009), despite being recognized as a genuine management philosophy nowadays, TOC has yet failed to demonstrate its effectiveness in the academic literature and as such, cannot be considered academically worthy enough to be called a widely recognized theory. TOC needs more case studies that prove a connection between implementation and improved financial performance.&lt;ref name=gupta2009&gt;
Gupta, Mahesh, and Doug Snyder. "Comparing TOC with MRP and JIT: a literature review." International Journal of Production Research 47.13 (2009): 3705-3739
&lt;/ref&gt;
Nave (2002) argues that TOC does not take employees into account and fails to empower them in the production process. He also states that TOC fails to address unsuccessful policies as constraints.&lt;ref name=nave2002&gt;
Nave, Dave. "How to compare six sigma, lean and the theory of constraints." Quality Progress 35.3 (2002): 73-80.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, Mukherjee and Chatterjee (2007) state that much of the criticism of Goldratt’s work has been focused on the lack of rigour in his work, but not of the bottleneck approach, which are two different aspects of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Mukherjee, S.M. and Chatterjee, A.K. (2007). The concept of bottleneck. Working Paper No. 2006-05-01, IIM Ahmedabad&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification and education==
The Theory of Constraints International Certification Organization (TOCICO) is an independent not-for-profit incorporated society that sets exams to ensure a consistent standard of competence. It is overseen by a board&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tocico.org/?page=tocico_board|title=TOCICO Board of Directors - Theory of Constraints International Certification Organization|author=|date=|website=www.tocico.org|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{secondary source needed|date=December 2015}} of academic and industrial experts.  It also hosts an annual international conference. The work presented at these conferences constitutes a core repository of the current knowledge.

[[File:Nordenfelt submarine Abdülhamid.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Nordenfelt class Ottoman submarine Abdülhamid (1886) was the first submarine in history to fire a torpedo whilst submerged. Two submarines of this class, ''Nordenfelt II'' (''Abdülhamid'', 1886) and ''Nordenfelt III'' (''Abdülmecid'', 1887) joined the Ottoman fleet. They were built in pieces by Des Vignes (Chertsey) and Vickers (Sheffield) in England, and assembled at the Taşkızak Naval Shipyard in Istanbul, Turkey.]]

'''Thorsten Nordenfelt''' (1 May 1842 – 18 August 1920), was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] inventor and industrialist.

Nordenfelt was born in Örby outside [[Kinna]], Sweden, the son of a colonel. The surname was and is often spelt Nordenfeldt, though Thorsten and his brothers always spelt it Nordenfelt, and the 1881 Census shows it as Nordenfelt. The family home in that year was Leinster Lodge on the Uxbridge Road, [[Paddington]] in west London.

Thorsten worked for a Swedish company in London from 1862 to 1866 and migrated to England in 1867 when he married Emma Stansfeld Grundy.

Thorsten Nordenfelt and his brother-in-law started a small business to trade Swedish steel for British rails in 1887. Later on he founded ''Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company, ltd'' to develop a machine-gun designed by [[Helge Palmcrantz]] that would be referred to as the [[Nordenfelt gun]]. His company also designed a range of anti-torpedoboat guns in calibres from 37 to 57&amp;nbsp;mm, that were produced in [[Erith]], Kent, Stockholm and Spain. Under pressure from [[Rothschild banking family of England|Rothschild]] and [[Vickers]] his company merged with [[Hiram Maxim|Maxim]]'s in 1888 to form The [[Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company]].

After a [[personal bankruptcy]] Nordenfelt was forced out of the Nordenfelt-Maxim company in 1890 and left England for France, where his new company, Société Nordenfelt, designed the eccentric screw breech used on the [[Canon de 75 modèle 1897|French 75]]. Legal action followed (''[[Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co Ltd]]'') over a non-compete clause Nordenfelt had signed.

In 1903 he returned to Sweden and retired.

In 1902 a public house named after Thorsten Nordenfelt was built at 181 Erith Road, Erith just along from the Gun and Carriage works of [[Vickers|Vickers, Sons and Maxim]] (previously [[Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company]]) . Named 'The Nordenfelt Tavern' it was built to the design of Jonathan G. Ensor (1852/3-19??), architect for brewer [[Watney Combe &amp; Reid]]&lt;ref&gt;James Packer 'Bexley Pubs' {{ISBN|0902541331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Submarines==

Discussions between Thorsten Nordenfelt and the English reverend [[George Garrett (inventor)|George Garrett]] led to the production of a series of steam powered [[submarines]]. The first was the ''Nordenfelt I'', a 56 tonne, 19.5 metre long vessel similar to Garret's ill-fated ''[[Resurgam]]'' (1879), with a range of 240 kilometres and armed with a single torpedo and a 25.4&amp;nbsp;mm machine gun. It was manufactured by [[Bolinders]] in Stockholm in 1884-1885. Like the ''Resurgam'', it operated on the surface using a 100 HP steam engine with a maximum speed of 9 kn, then it shut down its engine to dive. She was purchased by the Greek Government and was delivered to [[Salamis Naval Base]] in 1886. Following the acceptance tests, she was never used again by the [[Hellenic Navy]] and was scrapped in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Vice Admiral C. Paizis-Paradellis, HN | title=Hellenic Warships 1829-2001 (3rd Edition) | location=Athens, Greece | publisher=The Society for the study of Greek History | year=2002 | isbn=960-8172-14-4|page=133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nordenfelt then built the ''Nordenfelt II'' (''[[Ottoman submarine Abdül Hamid|Abdül Hamid]]'') in 1886 and ''Nordenfelt III'' (''Abdül Mecid'') in 1887, a pair of 30 metre long submarines with twin torpedo tubes, for the [[Ottoman Navy]]. ''Abdül Mamid'' became the first submarine in history to fire a torpedo while submerged under water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.submarineheritage.com/history.html Submarine Heritage Centre - submarine history of Barrow-in-Furness&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Nordenfelt's efforts culminated in 1887 with the ''Nordenfelt IV'' which had twin motors and twin torpedoes. It was sold to the Russians, but proved unstable and ran aground off Jutland; when the Russians refused to pay for it, it was scrapped.

''Abdülhamid'' and ''Abdülmecid'' were in [[Istanbul]] in 1914. The submarines were briefly considered for use in harbour defence but it was found that their hulls were too badly corroded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Royal Navy Submarine Service A Centennial History |last=Preston |first=Antony |authorlink= Antony Preston (naval historian) |year=2001 |publisher=Conway Maritime Press |isbn=0-85177-891-7 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WDCH-FM''' (99.1 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) is a radio station currently broadcasting a [[business news]] format to the [[Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area|Baltimore, Maryland/Washington, D.C. metropolitan area]].  Licensed to [[Bowie, Maryland]] the station is currently owned by [[Entercom]] and operated by [[Bloomberg L.P.]] Its transmitter is located near [[Crofton, Maryland]], and the broadcasting studios are located near the [[Washington Navy Yard]] along the north/west bank of the [[Anacostia River]] (Eastern Branch of the [[Potomac River]]) in [[Southeast, Washington, D.C.|Southeast Washington]]. 

WDCH is one of the few stations in the Baltimore/Washington corridor that directly targets ''both'' markets. This is because its transmitter is located halfway between the two cities, providing a strong city-grade signal to both.

WDCH-FM often airs [[D.C. United]] soccer and [[Washington Wizards]] pro [[basketball]] games in the [[NBA]] whenever sister station [[WJFK-FM]] (106.7 "The Fan") is already covering a game elsewhere.

==History==
{{see also|WHFS (historic)}}
The 99.1&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency was originally '''WNAV-FM''', licensed to [[Annapolis, Maryland]] and featuring a [[beautiful music]] format. It competed with similar stations in both the Baltimore and Washington markets. In 1983, the station changed calls to '''WLOM-FM'''.

In 1983 the owners of WHFS, then licensed to [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]] at 102.3 FM, sold that station for $2&amp;nbsp;million and used the money to purchase WLOM along with and its sister station [[WNAV]] (1430 AM).  The '''WHFS''' format and call letters were then moved to 99.1 FM, licensed to operate with 50,000 watts ([[list of broadcast station classes|Class B FM]]) with much higher power than the 102.3 facility, which broadcasts with only 3,000 watts (Class A) at the time; a Class A FM is the lowest coverage area as opposed to a [[list of broadcast station classes|Class A]] AM which is the greatest coverage area.  Thus WHFS on 99.1 could then be heard in Baltimore, Washington, and much of the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland]]. Eventually Einstein's group sold WHFS. When the station switched formats, it was located at the [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation|Infinity Broadcasting]] Center in [[Lanham, Maryland]]. The 102.3 frequency is now occupied by an Urban AC station in Washington, using the call letters [[WMMJ]] and nicknamed "Majic 102.3".

{{see also|HFStival}}
Since 1990, WHFS has hosted an event called the HFStival, an annual (sometimes semi-annual) day-long (sometimes two-day-long) outdoor concert. The concert, often held at Washington's [[RFK Stadium]], features a variety local and national acts; for example, the 2004 lineup included [[The Cure]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Modest Mouse]], the [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]], and [[Cypress Hill]]. Robert Benjamin, Bob Waugh and Bill Glasser took the HFStival from a small yearly concert in Fairfax, Virginia, to a large festival in Washington, D.C. that was headlined by major acts and was surrounded by culturally significant booths, games, food, and rides, as well as an outdoor second stage. Amongst others, [[Billy Zero]] was instrumental in growing the [[HFStival]] Locals Only Stage where bands like [[Good Charlotte]] and [[Jimmie's Chicken Shack]] got their big break. The term Locals Only stuck and is still used today and the Locals Only Stage was copied by Modern Rock Stations across the Country.

In the mid-1990s, Liberty Broadcasting published a quarterly magazine titled "WHFS Press" that was mailed to listeners and available in local music outlets.&lt;ref&gt;"WHFS Press", Liberty Broadcasting, Winter 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Though becoming famous as a cutting-edge station playing the latest underground music (and often beating the mainstream to the punch by months and even years), under Infinity Broadcasting's [[ownership]], the station became the local modern alternative rock station in the mid 90s.  No longer playing rather obscure progressive rock, nor the classic and hard rock of its Baltimore competitor [[WIYY]], HFS was now formatted more towards a younger set of fans who were more apt to listen to [[Green Day]] and Fuel than less mainstream artists such as [[Fugazi]] or [[Lou Reed]]. The station played much of the alternative hits that were touted by the mainstream press and MTV, turning off many old-school HFS listeners, but in turn gaining many listeners in the 18–24 age demographic.

During this period, WHFS featured a specialty show called "Now Hear This", hosted by Dave Marsh, which highlighted indie and local music.  The station never fully reverted to its prior all-indie status, but it did begin to combine more underground programming with its modern rock format.

In 1999, WHFS released a New Music New Video Compilation Volume 1 on VHS that was distributed free at Washington area [[Tower Records]] outlets. It featured tracks by [[Cyclefly]], [[Fuel (band)|Fuel]], [[Fastball (band)|Fastball]], [[Elliott Smith]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Eve 6]], [[3 Colours Red]], [[Puya (band)|Puya]], and [[Joydrop]].

==="El Zol 99.1 FM"===
At noon on January 12, 2005, 99.1 switched to a [[Tropical (radio format)|Tropical]] Latin music format. Its call letters were changed to '''WZLL'''  on January 28, 2005, and then again to '''WLZL''' on February 5, 2005, and the station was rebranded as "El Zol 99.1 FM". [[AOL]], which had a partnership with Infinity Broadcasting and recognized that many people would miss the old WHFS format, quickly launched an internet-only streaming radio station with a playlist much like that of WHFS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7886-2005Jan13.html WHFS: For Many, The Only Alternative]&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to numerous complaints about the format change, which attracted media attention, then-owner Infinity brought the WHFS format back a month later on the 105.7 FM frequency (now [[WJZ-FM]]). The WHFS call letters have since relocated first to a talk station on 1580 AM (now [[WJFK (AM)|WJFK]]), then to [[WUUB|a sister station]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]].  WLZL was also [[CBS Radio]]'s first Spanish radio station, and the company's only Spanish station outside the southern United States.

On November 16, 2011, CBS Radio announced plans to acquire WFSI (107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz) from religious broadcaster [[Family Radio]], with the intention of moving WLZL's Spanish Tropical format and ''"El Zol"'' branding from 99.1 to 107.9, with a new [[News radio|all-news]] format launched on 99.1 FM to compete directly with the region's leading all-news format station, long-time powerhouse [[WTOP-FM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.radio-info.com/news/official-cbs-buying-dc-baltimore-wfsi-1079-will-debut-all-news-on-991 |title=Radio-Info: "Official: CBS buying D.C.-Baltimore WFSI (107.9), will debut all-news on 99.1", November 16, 2011. |access-date=November 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120012948/http://www.radio-info.com/news/official-cbs-buying-dc-baltimore-wfsi-1079-will-debut-all-news-on-991 |archive-date=November 20, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsradio.com"&gt;[http://www.cbsradio.com/press_center/releases/pressrelease145027-11-16-2011.html CBS Radio press release: "CBS RADIO TO BRING ALL-NEWS STATION TO 99.1 FM IN WASHINGTON, D.C.", November 16, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The 99.1&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency then adopted the '''WNEW-FM''' call sign, which was named after the former [[WBBR|AM]] and [[WNEW-FM|FM]] stations of the same name in New York City.

&lt;ref name=rinsight-callandsoftlaunch&gt;[http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/54356/cbs-acquires-wfsi-to-launch-all-news-on-99-1/ Radio Insight: "CBS Acquires WFSI, To Launch All-News On 99.1", November 20, 2011] (updated January 22, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The format change occurred on December 1, when 99.1 and 107.9 both began simulcasting El Zol.&lt;ref name="cbsradio.com"/&gt; El Zol was finally moved to 107.9 on December 12, 2011, and 99.1 began [[Stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] with [[Christmas music]], with the '''WNEW-FM''' call letters now in place on 99.1. On December 27, 2011, WNEW-FM ended its Christmas music stunting and began stunting with the 1981 Silver Anniversary Edition of ''[[The History of Rock and Roll]]''.

===All News 99.1===
[[File:WNEW991.png|thumb|Logo as All News 99.1, 2012–15]]
The all-news format launched at noon on January 22, 2012;&lt;ref name=rinsight-callandsoftlaunch/&gt; the station initially planned to launch at 5 a.m. on January 19,&lt;ref name=ri-wnewlaunch&gt;{{cite news|title=CBS Radio's "All News 99.1" WNEW to debut in Washington, D.C. on Thursday, 1/19|url=http://www.radio-info.com/news/cbs-radios-all-news-991-wnew-to-debut-in-washington-dc-on-thursday-119|accessdate=January 3, 2012|newspaper=Radio-Info.com|date=January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but postponed it due to technical problems.&lt;ref name=ri-wnewdelay&gt;{{cite news|title=CBS delays the launch of Washington DC's "News 99.1"|url=http://www.radio-info.com/news/cbs-delays-the-launch-of-washington-dcs-news-991|accessdate=January 18, 2012|newspaper=Radio-Info.com|date=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station also broadcasts simultaneously in [[HD Radio]] on [[WIAD|94.7 FM – HD2]] and [[WJZ-FM|105.7 FM – HD2]].

WNEW-FM regularly programmed traffic reports and weather every five minutes between 5&amp;nbsp;am and 7&amp;nbsp;pm on the ones and sixes weekdays, and every ten minutes on the ones (six times an hour) the rest of the week (both from CBS local affiliate television station [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]], Channel 9), sports updates twice an hour at :25 and :55 from sister all-sports station [[WJFK-FM]], entertainment news once an hour, and business news from [[Bloomberg News]] twice an hour at :15 and :45. When breaking news warranted, WNEW-FM would break format to provide continuous coverage of any event. When the station began, it had traffic reports only every ten minutes, and had weather reports every four minutes. At the beginning, it focused on Washington area news, traffic, and weather. In 2014, the station expanded its coverage of the [[Baltimore metropolitan area]] by providing news, traffic and weather reports, and coordinated with on-air personalities in the news, sports and weather departments from its long-time market-leading station [[WJZ-TV]]; the change was widely promoted and advertised at the time. This was thought to be an opportune time, since competitor [[WFED|WTOP]] had switched from its long-time wide-ranging AM signal at 1500, to several FM repeaters which curtailed its traditionally strong signal across two states and the District. WNEW-FM was now the only station to provide coverage to ''both'' [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[Baltimore]], unlike WTOP, which had, since the early 1970s, focused on the Washington area and only occasionally carried Baltimore news events, sports or the slightly different weather and temperature readings.

As done with other CBS-owned all-news stations, WNEW-FM provided the audio feed of such network news programming as the daily ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' each weeknight at 7&amp;nbsp;pm, Sunday's ''[[Face the Nation]]'' interview/discussion program, and the weekly Sunday news magazine, ''[[60 Minutes]]''; the latter's simulcast was frequently promoted by WJZ-TV, but the radio broadcast was paused every 10 minutes for traffic and weather updates, and as a result, the WNEW-FM simulcast would be a few minutes behind the CBS television broadcast. In addition, similar to other CBS-owned all-news stations, ''60 Minutes'' was broadcast at 7&amp;nbsp;pm on Sundays each and every week, regardless of whether or not the televised version (usually an [[National Football League|NFL]] football game) was delayed on CBS.

===99.1 WNEW===
On February 23, 2015, WNEW-FM began airing [[Talk radio|Talk]] programs, including the syndicated [[The Dave Ramsey Show (radio program)|The Dave Ramsey Show]] in the evenings, a business and personal finance call-in program&lt;ref&gt;

On the first weekend in March 2015, media insider local internet news website dcrtv.com reported that CBS Radio was moving their DC-area radio stations studios and offices closer to [[Nationals Park]], which is the home of the local baseball team, the [[Washington Nationals]]. WNEW-FM was the first station to move. On March 8, 2015, WNEW-FM claimed that they were renovating their studios and could not continue broadcasting their ordinary news programming, promising to return to regular programming later that night. This came weeks after hosts on sister station [[WJFK-FM|WJFK-FM, 106.7, "The Fan"]] had similar problems.

===Bloomberg 99-1===
On December 18, 2015, at 10&amp;nbsp;am, WNEW-FM began simulcasting [[Bloomberg Radio]] as "Bloomberg 99.1 &amp; 105.7-HD2" after CBS began leasing the station to Bloomberg earlier that day.&lt;ref&gt;https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/95575/dc-all-news-battle-comes-to-end-as-cbs-sells-99-1-wnew/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://formatchange.com/wnew-becomes-bloomberg-99-1/&lt;/ref&gt; WIAD-HD2 would drop the WNEW simulcast and flip to [[classic hits]] a couple months later in February.

On March 15, 2016, WNEW-FM changed calls to '''WDCH-FM'''. The WNEW-FM call letters returned to New York City that same day.&lt;ref&gt;https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/105426/wnew-fm-call-letters-return-to-102-7-new-york/&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with [[Entercom]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/116299/cbs-radio-to-merge-with-entercom/  CBS Radio to Merge with Entercom]&lt;/ref&gt; The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entercom.com/press/entercom-receives-fcc-approval-merger-cbs-radio/|title=Entercom Receives FCC Approval for Merger with CBS Radio|work=Entercom|date=November 9, 2017|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/121072/entercom-completes-cbs-radio-merger/|title=Entercom Completes CBS Radio Merger|last=Venta|first=Lance|work=Radio Insight|date=November 17, 2017|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the merger, Bloomberg will continue to lease the station via a [[time brokerage agreement]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7796">[[File:William Duffus Hunt May 1931.jpg|thumb|Sir William Hunt 1931]]
Sir '''William Duffus Hunt''' [[Knight Bachelor|Kt]] (2 December 1867&amp;ndash;18 September 1939) was a leading New Zealand businessman of the first half of the twentieth century. With his partner [[James Armour Johnstone]] he built one of Australasia's leading stock and station agencies, [[Wright Stephenson|Wright Stephenson &amp; Co]].

==Family==
New Zealand-born of [[Gloucestershire]] wool-growing stock Hunt was the only son and eldest child of John Hunt, a farmer and early settler at [[Peria, Northland|Oruru]], [[Northland Region|Northland]], and his wife Maria Frances,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Maria Frances Duffus was a descendent of Josiah Paul Tippetts of [[Tetbury]] Gloucestershire. Josiah Paul Tippetts changed his surname to Paul (his mother's maiden name) becoming Josiah Paul Paul after inheriting [[Highgrove House|Highgrove]] from his Uncle John Paul.  Maria Frances's line of descent was Josiah Paul Paul (Tippetts) - son Robert Clark Paul (Tippetts) - daughter Maria Harriet Paul married John Duffus from Jamaica on 26 April 1830 in Tetbury&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of [[Jamaica]]-born [[Etonian]] Rev John Duffus M A, vicar of St Andrew, [[Mangonui]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecommunityarchive.org.nz/node/68012/description The Community Archive] accessed 20 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born on 2 December 1867 in Oruru, Northland, [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="DNZB Hunt"&gt;{{DNZB|title=William Duffus Hunt|first= William F.|last= Hunt|id=3h44|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

W D Hunt married twice. At Gore on 20 December 1894 he married Ismene Helena Stanley. Ismene had a daughter and a son before she died in May 1900. Two years later, 15 May 1902, Hunt married Jessie Belstead Edwards in Adelaide South Australia. There was just one child of the second marriage, a second son.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hunt"/&gt;

==Career==
;Recruit
William Hunt joined stock and station agency [[Wright Stephenson]] proper in 1891. His ability was recognised by Johnstone much earlier when he was employed by them for just two months at shearing time on Wright Stephenson-managed Blackstone Hill station in the [[Central Otago|Maniatoto]]. Though only 17 he was kept on at the station as a permanent shepherd  and soon took over the bookkeeping of the station and then its management. When Blackstone Hill station was subdivided in 1891 23 year old Hunt organised the muster and auction of the tens of thousands of sheep on the property. He was also required to act as auctioneer in the absence of George Stephenson of Wright Stephenson. J A Johnstone who had personally clerked the sale was so impressed he offered Hunt a position on the staff of Wright Stephenson &amp; Co.&lt;ref name=ACC&gt;''A Century's Challenge'', J C Irving and L A T Bell, Hutcheson Bowman, Wellington, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;
;Gore
The same year the partners in Wright Stephenson decided it was time to open their first branch. They chose [[Gore, New Zealand|Gore]] on the banks of the [[Mataura]] river and sent William Hunt to organise it though within three years times had become so hard it was deemed prudent to close Gore and confine operations to [[Otago]]. In spite of their difficulties Hunt's well chosen Gore customers all settled their accounts in full. In 1896 the government resumed borrowing overseas making advances to settlers on freeholds and long term leaseholds at moderate interest rates and the farming outlook improved. Gore was re-opened and another branch opened at Invercargill, Hunt being made responsible for all [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland province]]. Johnstone remained in Otago.&lt;ref name=ACC/&gt;
;Control of Wright Stephenson
When the founding partners withdrew from the firm with the turn of the century Johnstone and Hunt acquired the major holdings of the shares in the firm. As the rabbit pest was brought under control their customers began to prosper once more and Wright Stephenson was incorporated as a public company in 1906. The initial directors were J A Johnstone (chairman) Hunt and P L Wright, Johnstone and Hunt were joint managing directors. In early 1907 Johnstone's health failed and he took 12 months leave to recuperate. Over that time W D Hunt acted as Chairman as well as sole managing director and when Johnstone returned to work he resumed the joint managing directorship but he acknowledged William Hunt's achievements and Hunt stayed Chairman of Directors.&lt;ref name=ACC/&gt; Hunt managed to visit every one of his firm's branches each year.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hunt"/&gt;

;Wellington
Wright Stephenson's activities spread across New Zealand and into all farming areas. Rapidly becoming a major national business they merged with Wellington's [[Alexander Turnbull (bibliophile)|W &amp; G Turnbull and Co]] and [[James Gunson|W Gunson and Co]] in Auckland.  It became clear a central location was necessary and in 1917 the Head office left Dunedin for Wellington. In 1920 the Abraham and Williams business covering [[Manawatu District|Manawatu]]-[[Rangitikei District|Rangitikei]] and adjacent districts came under their expanding umbrella. The sale of new motor vehicles and their servicing was added as were the provision of all farm requirements including bulk groceries and home appliances. It seemed that everything might be supplied until staunch lifetime [[Prohibition#New Zealand|prohibitionist]] Hunt felt obliged to draw the line at the last commodity they might sell. Wright Stephenson stocked no alcohol of any kind.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hunt"/&gt;

After the end of World War I a new [[Stud (animal)|stud]] department for all pedigree livestock soon extended to importing and exporting. An annual sale of [[thoroughbred]] yearlings was established in 1927 which brought buyers from all over the world.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hunt"/&gt;

==Activities away from Wright Stephenson==
;Meat Board 1922 and Dairy Board 1923
W D Hunt was the Stock and Station Agency industry representative on both the [[New Zealand Meat Producers Board]] and the [[New Zealand Wool Board]]. The business of each board was central to his core business marketing farm produce.
;Directorships included
* [[AMP Society]] New Zealand branch, there was always a close association between the firms
* [[New Zealand Insurance]]
;Commissions and other boards
* 1912 Public Service Commission
* 1917 National Efficiency Board
* 1924 Royal Commission on taxation
* 1930 chairman Committee on Unemployment
and in 1932 he was awarded a knighthood for public services&lt;ref&gt;King's Birthday Honours. ''The Times'', Friday, Jun 03, 1932; pg. 19; Issue 46150&lt;/ref&gt;
;Private life
Until he moved his family to [[Wellington]] in 1917 he lived in [[Invercargill]] where he ran stud [[Holstein (cattle)|Friesians]] and stud [[Romney (sheep)|Romneys]]. On making the move he gave their Invercargill home to the [[Plunket Society]], he was chairman of Plunket's specialist manufacturing operation. He was a keen deer stalker and fly fisherman.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hunt"/&gt;

==Death==
Before the outbreak of war in 1939 he travelled from London to Wellington by air and contracted [[meningitis]] during the flight. A few months later, 18 September 1939, he died in Wellington aged 71. Hunt was survived by his second wife and a son from each marriage.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hunt"/&gt;

His obituary in Wellington's Evening Post described him as devoid of ostentation and readily approachable.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary. ''Evening Post'', Volume CXXVIII, Issue 68, 18 September 1939, Page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
WiseWindow began developing its core technology in 2007, based on the work of its founder, Rajiv Dulapet, while he was a research fellow at Stanford University. The premise of WiseWindow is to utilize mass opinions expressed on the Internet to develop business intelligence that is useful to companies and to develop more accurate forecasts of consumer behavior.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisewindow.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=106&lt;/ref&gt;

WiseWindow acquired the marketing research firm Core Strategies in 2009, which was founded by Marshall Toplansky. With the acquisition, the company adapted and productized its technology to be able to  calibrate  Mass Opinion Business Intelligence (MOBI) data with traditional forms of quantitative and qualitative market research, and provide on-going tracking metrics that are of use to marketers and operating management within client companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pr.com/press-release/132492&lt;/ref&gt;

KPMG acquired Wise Window in April, 2012.  The three co-founders have integrated Wise Window's MOBI technology into KPMG's data analytics practice. The financial terms of the acquisition were not made public.

== Partnerships ==
