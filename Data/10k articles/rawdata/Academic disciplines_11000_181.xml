'''Allegany College of Maryland''' (or '''ACM''') is a two-year public community college located in [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], [[Maryland]]. It was previously known as '''Allegany Community College''' (or '''ACC''').

== History ==

Allegany College of Maryland began operations in 1961 as "Allegany Community College" in an old public school facility (the segregationist era all-black Carver Community School) that had been closed by the Allegany County Board of Education. The College opened with an enrollment of 122 students from Allegany County under the direction of ACM’s first president, Dr. Robert S. Zimmer.

In 1969, the College moved to a new campus consisting of seven buildings on a 316-acre (1.3&amp;nbsp;km²) tract in suburban Cumberland that was partially funded by the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]]. Enrollment reached the 1000 mark in credit programs during the first year on the new campus and community service and continuing education courses and programs began. Since that time, the campus has expanded to include 15 buildings, which provide modern facilities for both credit and non-credit students.

The College opened two Pennsylvania campuses in 1989 ([[Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Somerset County]] Campus in [[Somerset, Pennsylvania]]) and 1990 ([[Bedford County, Pennsylvania|Bedford County]] Campus in [[Everett, Pennsylvania]]). It expanded its Hospitality Management and Culinary Arts programs into the Gateway Center located in downtown Cumberland in 2002.

The College now serves over 3,700 credit students and over 15,000 continuing education registrations. Over 1,000 of these credit students are served at the Pennsylvania campuses.

On January 17, 2017 it was announced that the Somerset location will close following the Spring 2017 semester.

== Programs ==

The College offers over 53 associate degrees, 23 certificates, and 21 letters of recognition.

== Athletics ==
The College's men's baseball and basketball teams have been consistently ranked in the top 20 of their respective [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA) Divisions. The baseball team participated in the NJCAA national tournaments nine times, including a four-year run from 1994-1997. The men's basketball team has participated twelve times in the NJCAA national tournament in 1995-96 (finished 2nd), 1997–98, 2000–01 (finished 2nd), 2001–02, 2003–04 and 2007–08.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electroniccampus.org/CampusTour/undergraduate/1256/Allegany_College_of_Maryland/Allegany_College_of_Maryland1.html Electronic Campus - Select a College - Campus Tours - Allegany College of Maryland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance and accreditation ==
The [[Maryland Higher Education Commission]] (MHEC) oversees and coordinates higher education in the State of Maryland including academic and financial policies at the College. An eight-member Board of Trustees, appointed by the [[Governor of Maryland|Governor of the State of Maryland]], governs the College. The College also has an advisory board for each of its two Pennsylvania Campuses—the Bedford County Campus Advisory Committee ([[Bedford County, Pennsylvania]]) and the Somerset County Campus Advisory Committee ([[Somerset County, Pennsylvania]]).

The college is a member of the [[Maryland Association of Community Colleges]] (MACC) and is accredited by the Commission on Higher Education, [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]]. The College is also accredited and approved for operation by MHEC. The [[Pennsylvania Department of Education]] has granted certification to Allegany College of Maryland campuses in Bedford and Somerset counties and to the academic programs they offer.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

[[File:Silverback.JPG|thumb|300px|Male "silverback" [[gorilla]]s are usually the alpha animal and may receive preferential treatment such as being groomed by other group members]]

In studies of [[social animal]]s, the highest ranking individual is sometimes designated as the '''alpha'''. [[Male]]s, [[female]]s, or both, can be alphas, depending on the species. Where one male and one female fulfill this role together, they are sometimes referred to as the alpha pair. Other animals in the same social group may exhibit deference or other species-specific subordinate behaviours towards the alpha or alphas.

Alpha animals usually gain preferential access to food and other desirable items or activities, though the extent of this varies widely between species. Male or female alphas may gain preferential access to sex or mates; in some species, only alphas or an alpha pair reproduce.

Alphas may achieve their status by superior [[physical strength]] and [[aggression]], or through social efforts and building alliances within the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Waal|first=Frans |authorlink=Frans de Waal|title=Chimpanzee Politics: Power and Sex Among Apes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsrhU2vV5PIC|accessdate=13 July 2011|edition=25th Anniversary|year=2007|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press|JHU Press]]|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=978-0-8018-8656-0|origyear=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual with alpha status sometimes changes, often through a fight between the dominant and a subordinate animal. These fights are often to the death, depending on the animal.

==Beta and omega==
Social animals in a hierarchical community are sometimes assigned ranks in [[ethology]] studies.

Beta animals often act as [[second-in-command]] to the reigning alpha or alphas and will act as new alpha animals if an alpha dies or is otherwise no longer considered an alpha. In some species of birds, males pair up in twos when courting, the beta male aiding the alpha male. It has been found that the social context of the animals has a significant impact on courtship behavior and the overall reproductive success of that animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.factiva.com/ha/default.aspx |title= Seizing the Opportunity: Subordinate Male Fowl Respond Rapidly to Variation in Social Context. Ethology |author= Wilson and colleagues|date=6 October 2009 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Omega (usually rendered ω) is an [[antonym]] used to refer to the lowest caste of the hierarchical society. Omega animals are subordinate to all others in the community, and are expected by others in the group to remain submissive to everyone. Omega animals may also be used as communal scapegoats or outlets for frustration, or given the lowest priority when distributing food.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Dutcher, Jamie Dutcher, James Manfull [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-8PAQAAMAAJ ''Wolves at our door: the extraordinary story of the couple who lived with wolves''] pp.89, 145&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Primates===
[[Common chimpanzees]] use strength, intelligence, and political alliances to establish and maintain alpha position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=M|last2=Gilby|first2=I|last3=Murray|first3=C|last4=Johnson|first4=A|last5=Wroblewski|first5=E|last6=Pusey|first6=A|date=2009|title=Alpha Male Chimpanzee Grooming Patterns: Implications for Dominance ''Style''|url=https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/sites/evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/files/Foster%20et%20al%202009%20Alhpa%20male%20chimapanzee%20styles.pdf|journal=American Journal of Primatology |volume=71|pages=136–144|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alpha males who solely use intimidation and aggression to keep their position often provoke dissent.

Common chimpanzees show deference to the alpha of the community by ritualized postures and gestures such as presenting their back, crouching, bowing, or bobbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chimpanzoo.org/african_notecards/chapter_11.html|title=ChimpanZoo Homepage|website=Chimpanzoo.org|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{verify source|date=August 2018}} Chimpanzees lower in rank than the alpha male will offer their hand while grunting to the alpha male as a sign of submission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Noonan, PhD.|date=|title=Inside a Chimpanzee Community|url=http://www.conservenature.org/learn_about_wildlife/chimpanzees/chimp_community.htm|publisher=Canisius Ambassadors for Conservation}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bonobo]] society on the other hand is governed by alpha females. Males will associate with females for rank acquisition because females dominate the social environment. If a male is to achieve alpha status in a bonobo group, he must be accepted by the alpha female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kristina Cawthon Lang|date=2010-12-01|title=Primate Factsheets: Bonobo|url=http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/bonobo/behav|publisher=Primate Info Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Female bonobos use homosexual sex to increase social status. High-ranking females rarely interact sexually with other females, but low-ranking females interact sexually with all females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lin Edwards|date=2012-03-02|title=Female bonobos use homosexual sex to increase social status|url=https://phys.org/news/2012-03-female-bonobos-homosexual-sex-social.html|website=Phys.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gorilla]]s use intimidation to establish and maintain alpha position. A study conducted regarding the [[reproductive]] behavior of male [[mountain gorilla]]s (''Gorilla beringei beringei'') found further evidence that [[dominance (ethology)|dominant]] males are favored to father offspring, even when there is a greater number of males in a notably enlarged group size. The study also concluded that mating access dropped off less steeply with status; alpha, [[beta (ethology)|beta]], and [[gamma (ethology)|gamma]] showing  more similar mating success, compared to what had been previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoinski|first=T.S.|author2=Rosenbaum, T.|author3= Ngaboyamahina, T.|author4= Vecellio, V.|author5= Ndagijimana, F.|author6= Fawcett, K.|title=Patterns of male reproductive behaviour in multi-male groups of mountain gorillas: examining theories of reproductive skew|journal=Behaviour|year=2009|volume=146|issue=9|pages=1193–1215|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/beh/2009/00000146/00000009/art00002|accessdate=1 April 2012|doi=10.1163/156853909x419992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on the association of alpha males and females during the non-breeding season in wild Capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella nigritus) examined whether alpha males are the preferred mate for females and, secondly, whether female-alpha status and relationship to the alpha-male can be explained through the individual characteristics and or social network of the female.&lt;ref name="Tiddi2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tiddi|first=Barbara|title=Social relationships between adult females and the alpha male in wild tufted Capuchin monkeys|journal=American Journal of Primatology|pmid=21698660|doi=10.1002/ajp.20939|volume=73|issue=8|pages=812–20|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results indicated that alpha male Capuchin are the preferred mate for adult females. However, only the alpha females had strong interactions with the alpha males by virtue of a [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]] hierarchy among the females in which only the most dominant and strong females were able to interact with the alpha male.&lt;ref name="Tiddi2012"/&gt;

Researcher [[M.W. Foster]] investigated primates and found that the leaders were more likely to be those who did more for those around them instead of being determined by strength. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=M.W.|year=2009|title=Alpha male chimpanzee grooming patterns: implications for dominance "style"|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=2009|issue=2|pages=136–144|doi=10.1002/ajp.20632|pmid=19025996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canines===
In the past, the prevailing view on [[grey wolf]] packs was that they consisted of individuals vying with each other for dominance, with dominant grey wolves being referred to as the "alpha" male and female, and the subordinates as "beta" and "omega" wolves. This terminology was first used in 1947 by Rudolf Schenkel of the [[University of Basel]], who based his findings on researching the behaviour of captive grey wolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davemech.org/schenkel/|title=Schenkel's Classic Wolf Behavior Study Available in English|website=Davemech.org|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view on gray wolf pack dynamics was later popularized by the researcher [[L. David Mech]] in his 1970 book ''The Wolf''. He later found additional evidence that the concept of an Alpha male may have been an erroneous interpretation of incomplete data and formally disavowed this terminology in 1999. He explained that it was heavily based on the behavior of captive packs consisting of unrelated individuals, an error reflecting the once prevailing view that wild pack formation occurred in winter among independent gray wolves. Later research on wild gray wolves revealed that the pack is usually a family consisting of a breeding pair and their offspring of the previous 1–3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mech, L. David. |year=1999|url=http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/2000/alstat/alstat.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214072331/http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/2000/alstat/alstat.htm |archivedate=December 14, 2005 |title=Alpha status, dominance, and division of labor in wolf packs|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume= 77|pages=1196–1203|doi=10.1139/z99-099|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrea Palladio''' ({{IPA-it|anˈdrɛːa palˈlaːdjo}}; 30 November 1508&amp;nbsp;– 19 August 1580) was an [[Italians|Italian]]&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt; architect active in the [[Venetian Republic]]. Palladio, influenced by [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek architecture]], primarily by [[Vitruvius]], is widely considered to be one of the most influential individuals in the [[Architectural history|history of architecture]]. All of his buildings are located in what was the Venetian Republic, but his teachings, summarized in the architectural treatise, ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura|The Four Books of Architecture]]'', gained him wide recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], [http://www.palladiancenter.org/palladio.html His conception of classical architecture was heavily influenced by Vitruvian ideas and his mentor Trissino. "Andrea Palladio."]&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Vicenza]], with its twenty-three buildings designed by Palladio, and the [[Palladian Villas of the Veneto]] are listed together as [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]].

==Biography==
Palladio was born on 30 November 1508 in [[Padua]] and was given the name, Andrea Di Pietro della Gondola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Houghton Mifflin dictionary of biography |page=1167 |year=2003 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]]|isbn=0-618-25210-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfesntdNnbwC&amp;lpg=PA1167&amp;pg=PA1167#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Pietro, called "Della Gondola", was a miller. From early on, Andrea Palladio was introduced into the work of building. In Padua he gained his first experiences as a stonecutter in the sculpture workshop of Bartolomeo Cavazza da Sossano, who was the sculptor responsible for the altar in the Church of Santa Maria dei Carmini in Padua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moose|first1=editor, Christina J.|title=Great lives from history.|date=2005|publisher=Salem Press|location=Pasadena, Calif.|isbn=978-1-58765-211-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavazza da Sossano is said to have imposed particularly hard working conditions. At the age of sixteen he moved to Vicenza where he would reside for most of his life. Here he became an assistant in the Pedemuro studio, a leading workshop of stonecutters and masons. He joined a guild of stonemasons and bricklayers. He was employed as a stonemason to make monuments and decorative sculptures. These sculptures reflected the [[Mannerist]] style of the architect [[Michele Sanmicheli]].

Perhaps the key moment that sparked Palladio's career was being employed by the Humanist poet and scholar, [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]], from 1538 to 1539. While Trissino was reconstructing the Villa Cricoli, he took interest in Palladio's work. Trissino was heavily influenced by the studies of Vitruvius, who later influenced Palladio's own ideals and attitudes toward classical architecture. As the leading intellectual in Vicenza, Trissino stimulated the young man to appreciate the arts, sciences, and Classical literature and he granted him the opportunity to study Ancient architecture in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;He visited Rome alongside Trissino in 1541, 1547, and 1554 until 1556. His earlier visits to Rome influenced his designs of palaces. He modeled his designs based on his interpretation of classical architecture he had witnessed. Curl, James Stevens, "A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture", [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also Trissino who gave him the name by which he became known, Palladio, an allusion to the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] of wisdom [[Athena|Pallas Athene]] and to a character of a play by Trissino. Indeed, the word Palladio means ''Wise one''.&lt;ref&gt;"How I Spent A Few Days in Palladio's World" ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 3 March 2009, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123603460173214171?mod=article-outset-box WSJ.com]&lt;/ref&gt; After Trissino's death in 1550, Palladio benefited from the patronage of the Barbaro brothers, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Daniele Barbaro]], who encouraged his studies of [[classical architecture]] and brought him to Rome in 1554, and his younger brother [[Marcantonio Barbaro]]. The powerful Barbaros introduced Palladio to [[Venice]], where he finally became "Proto della Serenissima" (chief architect of the Republic of Venice) after [[Jacopo Sansovino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mostra del Palladio: Vicenza / Basilica Palladiana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUk3AQAAIAAJ|year=1973|publisher=Electa|page=46|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Barbaros, the Corner, [[Foscari]], and [[Pisani family|Pisani]] families supported Palladio's career.&lt;ref&gt;''Venice and the Renaissance", Manfredo Tafuri, trans.

Andrea Palladio began to develop his own architectural style around 1541. The [[Palladian architecture|Palladian style]], named after him, adhered to classical [[Roman architecture|Roman]] principles he rediscovered, applied, and explained in his works.&lt;ref&gt;Palladio knew relatively little about Greek architecture, not yet rediscovered at his times, but he studied deeply the Roman remains during five trips to Rome. His works are heavily influenced by his studies of Greco-Roman architecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrea Palladio is known to be one of the most influential architects in Western architecture. His architectural works have "been valued for centuries as the quintessence of High Renaissance calm and harmony" (Watkin, D., ''A History of Western Architecture''). He designed many palaces, [[villa]]s, and churches, but Palladio's reputation, initially, and after his death, has been founded on his skill as a designer of villas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Burns]], [http://www.cisapalladio.org/cisa/doc/bio_i.php?lingua=i&amp;sezione=4&amp;lingua=e ''Andrea Palladio (1508–1580)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924065640/http://www.cisapalladio.org/cisa/doc/bio_i.php?lingua=i&amp;sezione=4&amp;lingua=e |date=24 September 2009 }}, [[Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[palladian villas]] are located mainly in the [[province of Vicenza]], while the ''[[palazzo|palazzi]]'' are concentrated in the city of [[Vicenza]] and the churches in [[Venice]]. A number of his works are now protected as part of the [[World Heritage Site]] ''[[City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto]]''. Other buildings by Palladio are to be found within the ''Venice and its Lagoon'' World Heritage Site.

Palladio's first major public project began when his designs for building the [[loggia]]s for the town hall, known as the [[Basilica Palladiana]], were approved in 1548. He proposed an addition of two-storey stone buttresses reflecting the Gothic style of the existing hall while using classical proportions. The construction was completed in 1617 after Palladio's death.

Aside from Palladio's designs, his publications contributed to ''[[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]]''. During the second half of his life, Palladio published many books, above all, ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (''The four books of architecture'', Venice, 1570). Palladio is most known for his designs of villas and palaces as well as his books.

The precise circumstances of his death are unknown. Palladio died in 1580,&lt;ref name="Avcioglu2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr Nebahat Avcioglu|title=Architecture, Art and Identity in Venice and its Territories, 1450–1750: Essays in Honour of Deborah Howard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOL9i4VXrtkC&amp;pg=PA150|date=23 December 2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4724-1082-5|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; retold in tradition, in [[Maser, Italy|Maser]], near [[Treviso]], and was buried in the church of [[Santa Corona]] in Vicenza; since the nineteenth century his tomb has been located in the ''Cimitero Maggiore'' of Vicenza.

Palladio's architecture was not dependent on expensive materials, which must have been an advantage to his more financially pressed clients. Many of his buildings are of brick covered with [[stucco]]. Stuccoed brickwork was always used in his villa designs in order to portray his interpretations of the Roman villa typology.

In the later part of his career, Palladio was chosen by powerful members of Venetian society for numerous important commissions. His success as an architect is based not only on the beauty of his work, but also for its harmony with the culture of his time. His success and influence came from the integration of extraordinary aesthetic quality with expressive characteristics that resonated with his client's social aspirations. His buildings served to communicate, visually, their place in the social order of their culture. This powerful integration of beauty and the physical representation of social meanings is apparent in three major building types: the urban palazzo, the agricultural villa, and the church.

Relative to his trips to Rome, Palladio developed three main palace types by 1556. In 1550, the [[Palazzo Chiericati]] was completed. The proportions for the building were based on musical ratios for adjacent rooms. The building was centralized by a tripartite division of a series of columns or colonnades. In 1552, the [[Palazzo Porto|Palazzo Iseppo Porto]] located in Vicenza was rebuilt incorporating the Roman Renaissance element for façades. A colonnade of Corinthian columns surrounded a main court. The [[Palazzo Antonini]] in Udine, constructed in 1556, had a centralized hall with four columns and service spaces placed relatively toward one side. He uses styles of incorporating the six columns, supported by pediments, into the walls as part of the façade. This technique had been applied in his villa designs as well. Palladio experimented with the plan of the Palazzo Iseppo Porto by incorporating it into the [[Palazzo Thiene]]. It was an earlier project from 1545 to 1550 and remained uncompleted due to elaborate elevations in his designs. He used Mannerist elements such as stucco surface reliefs and large columns, often extending two stories high.

In his urban structures he developed a new improved version of the typical early [[Renaissance]] palazzo (exemplified by the [[Palazzo Strozzi]]). Adapting a new urban palazzo type created by [[Bramante]] in the [[House of Raphael]], Palladio found a powerful expression of the importance of the owner and his social position. The main living quarters of the owner on the second level were clearly distinguished in importance by use of a [[pediment]]ed classical [[portico]], centered and raised above the subsidiary and utilitarian ground level (illustrated in the [[Palazzo Porto]] and the [[Palazzo Valmarana]]). The tallness of the portico was achieved by incorporating the owner's sleeping quarters on the third level, within a [[Giant order|giant]] two-story classical colonnade, a motif adapted from [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Capitoline]] buildings in Rome. The elevated main floor level became known as the "[[piano nobile]]", and is still referred to as the "first floor" in Europe.

[[File:Monument to Andrea Palladio (Vicenza).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Palladio in Vicenza]]
Palladio also established an influential new building format for the agricultural villas of the Venetian [[aristocracy]]. Palladio's approach to his villa designs was not relative to his experience in Rome. His designs were based on practicality and employed few reliefs. He consolidated the various stand-alone farm outbuildings into a single impressive structure, arranged as a highly organized whole, dominated by a strong center and symmetrical side wings, as illustrated at [[Villa Barbaro]]. In the project of the Villa Barbaro, Palladio most likely was also engaged in the interior decoration. Alongside the painter [[Paolo Veronese]], he invented the complex and sophisticated illusionistic landscape paintings that cover the walls of various rooms.&lt;ref&gt;For the illusionistic landscape paintings and the relationship of Palladio and Veronese see http://www.kunstgeschichte-ejournal.net/329/1/Paolo_Veronese%2C_Andrea_Palladio_und_die_Stanza_di_Baco.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Villa Rotonda]] of 1552, outside Vicenza, was constructed as a summer house with views from all four sides. The plan has centralized circular halls with wings and porticos expanding on all four sides. Palladio began to implement the classical temple front into his design of façades for villas. He felt that to make an entry appear grand, the Roman temple front would be the most suitable style. The Palladian villa configuration often consists of a centralized block raised on an elevated [[podium]], accessed by grand steps, and flanked by lower service wings, as at [[Villa Foscari]] and [[Villa Badoer]]. This format, with the quarters of the owners at the elevated center of their own world, found resonance as a prototype for Italian villas and later for the country estates of the British nobility (such as [[Lord Burlington]]'s [[Chiswick House]], Vanbrugh's [[Blenheim Palace|Blenheim]], Walpole's [[Houghton Hall]], and Adam's [[Kedleston Hall]] and [http://www.paxtonhouse.co.uk/ Paxton House] in Scotland). His villas were used by a capitalist gentry who developed an interest in agriculture and land. The configuration was a perfect architectural expression of their worldview, clearly expressing their perceived position in the social order of the times. His influence was extended worldwide into the [[British colonies]]. Palladio developed his own prototype for the plan of the villas that was flexible to moderate in scale and function. The Palladian villa format was easily adapted for a democratic worldview, as may be seen at [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Monticello]] and his arrangement for the [[University of Virginia]]. It also may be seen applied as recently as 1940 in Pope's [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery]] in Washington D.C., where the public entry to the world of high culture occupies the exalted center position. The [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]] of exposed [[basement]] walls of Victorian residences is a late remnant of the Palladian format, clearly expressed as a podium for the main living space for the family.

Similarly, Palladio created a new configuration for the design of [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] churches that established two interlocking architectural orders, each clearly articulated, yet delineating a hierarchy of a larger order overriding a lesser order. This idea was in direct coincidence with the rising acceptance of the theological ideas of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], who postulated the notion of two worlds existing simultaneously: the divine world of faith, and the earthly world of humans.  Palladio created an architecture which made a visual statement communicating the idea of two superimposed systems, as illustrated at [[San Francesco della Vigna]]. In a time when religious dominance in Western culture was threatened by the rising power of science and [[secular humanism|secular humanists]], this architecture found great favor with the Catholic Church as a clear statement of the proper relationship of the earthly and the spiritual worlds.

==Influence==
[[File:Palladio Titel 1642.jpg|thumb|upright|The front page of ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture)]]

[[File:Frontispiece Campbell's edition of Palladio's First Book of Architecture 1728.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] from [[Colen Campbell]]'s edition of Palladio's ''First Book of Architecture'', published at London, 1728]]

Although his buildings are all in a relatively small part of Italy, Palladio's influence was far-reaching. One factor in the spread of his influence was the publication in 1570 of his architectural treatise, ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture), which set out rules others could follow. The first book includes studies of decorative styles, classical orders, and materials. The second book included Palladio's town and country house designs and classical reconstructions. The third book has bridge and basilica designs, city planning designs, and classical halls. The fourth book included information on the reconstruction of ancient Roman temples. Before this landmark publication, architectural drawings by Palladio had appeared in print as illustrations to [[Daniele Barbaro]]'s "Commentary" on [[Vitruvius]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Clini "Vitruvius' Basilica at Fano: The drawings of a lost building from 'De Architectura Libri Decem'" The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Vol. XXXIV, Part 5/W12 pp121 – 126 2002 [http://www.commission5.isprs.org/wg4/workshop_ancona/proceedings/26.pdf ISPRS.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517124924/http://www.commission5.isprs.org/wg4/workshop_ancona/proceedings/26.pdf |date=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in his style was renewed in later generations and became fashionable throughout Europe, for example in parts of the [[Loire Valley]] of France. In Britain, [[Inigo Jones]], [[Elizabeth Wilbraham]], and [[Christopher Wren]] embraced the Palladian style. In his [[Italian Journey]], [[Johann von Goethe]] describes Palladio as a genius, commending his unfinished Convent of Saint Maria della Carita as the most perfect existing work of architecture. Another admirer was the architect, [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Richard Boyle]], 4th [[Earl of Cork]], also known as [[Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]], who, with [[William Kent]], designed [[Chiswick House]]. The influence of Palladio even spread to America. [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Thomas Dawes]] much admired that style of architecture, and the United States Capitol building is an example of a slightly evolved version of Palladio's works. The One Hundred Eleventh [[Congress of the United States of America]] called him the "Father of American Architecture"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcadoc.it/english/news/Palladio-Father-of-American-Architecture.htm|title=The US Congress: 'Palladio, the Father of American Architecture'|website=www.marcadoc.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Congressional Resolution no. 259 of 6 December 2010). Exponents of Palladianism include the eighteenth century [[Venice|Venetian]] architect, [[Giacomo Leoni]], who published an authoritative four-volume work on Palladio and his architectural concepts.

More than 330 of Palladio's original drawings and sketches still survive in the collections of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/CollectingPalladio.aspx Collecting Palladio's drawings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926192605/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/CollectingPalladio.aspx |date=26 September 2009 }}, website of the Royal Institute of British Architects, accessed 24 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; most of which originally were owned by Inigo Jones. Jones collected a significant number of these on his Grand Tour of 1613–1614, while some were a gift from [[Henry Wotton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/InigoJonesAquiresTheDrawings.aspx Inigo Jones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926192618/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/InigoJonesAquiresTheDrawings.aspx |date=26 September 2009 }}, website of the Royal Institute of British Architects, accessed 24 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], a nonprofit membership organization, was founded in 1979 to research and promote understanding of Palladio's influence in the architecture of the United States.

In 2010, the [[National Building Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] created an exhibition dedicated solely to Palladio and his legacy. The exhibition, titled ''Palladio and His Legacy: A Transatlantic Journey'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/palladio-and-his-legacy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710002925/http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/palladio-and-his-legacy.html |archivedate=10 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was open to the public until January 2011.

The '''Association for Heritage Interpretation''' (AHI) is a membership based organisation for people actively involved or concerned with [[heritage interpretation]].

AHI began as the '''Society for the Interpretation of Britain’s Heritage''' in 1975 and later became the Association for Heritage Interpretation. It has a membership of over 400 interpreters from around the world. It is managed by an Executive Committee which meets four times a year and holds an AGM at the Annual Conference in the Autumn.&lt;ref name=whatis /&gt; AHI’s president was [[John Edmondson, 2nd Baron Sandford|Lord Sandford]] (1920-2009){{cn|date=November 2016}} and its patron is Loyd Grossman.&lt;ref name=awards /&gt;

The Association states&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;{{cite web|title=What is AHI?|url=http://www.ahi.org.uk/www/about/what_is_ahi/|publisher=Association for Heritage Interpretation|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it:
{{quote| ... works to:

* Encourage excellence in interpretation 
* Promote professionalism in interpretation 
* Facilitate discussion and exchange of ideas 
* Support a wide range of organisations in their service to visitors 
* Develop and recognise best practice }}

AHI offers a focus for ideas, debate and networking. The association brings together people actively involved or concerned with interpretation of natural and cultural heritage. Some work as interpretation or heritage officers, park rangers or countryside managers, others as designers or illustrators, planners, teachers, curators, consultants, academics or people from many other professions with an interest in our environmental inheritance.

AHI publishes its journal ''Interpretation'' three times year, produces bi-monthly newsletters and organises a series of training events each year. In 2007, AHI worked with [[Interpret Scotland]] to hold [[The Vital Spark Interpretation Conference]] in Aviemore. The vibrant annual AHI conference is hosted in different venues across Britain and brings together interpreters to meet each other, present papers on interpretation practice and visit local visitor sites to see case studies of interpretation. Recent hosts have included Bournemouth, Cardiff, Newcastle and Shropshire. The 2013 conference is in Edinburgh in October.

==Awards==
The AHI offered '''Discover Heritage Awards''' in 2015 and 2017.&lt;ref name=awards&gt;{{cite web|title=Discover Heritage Awards|url=http://www.ahi.org.uk/www/awards/|publisher=Association for Heritage Interpretation|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1984 to 2007 the '''Interpret Britain and Ireland Awards''' were awarded annually, "recognising innovative and inspiring interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Awards|url=http://www.ahi.org.uk/www/awards/view_details/4/|publisher=Association for Heritage Interpretation|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lett. 47, 693 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; in [[statistical physics]], also known as the fourth-order cumulant &lt;math&gt;U_L=1-\frac{{\langle s^4\rangle}_L}{3{\langle s^2\rangle}^2_L}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[kurtosis]] of the order parameter, ''s''. It is frequently used to determine accurately [[phase transition]] points in numerical simulations of various models. &lt;ref&gt;K. Binder, D. W. Heermann, Monte Carlo Simulation in Statistical Physics: An Introduction (2010) Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

The phase transition point is usually identified comparing the
behavior of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; as a function of the temperature for different values of the system size &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. The transition temperature is the unique point where the different curves cross in the [[thermodynamic limit]]. This behavior is based on the fact that 
in the critical region, &lt;math&gt;T\approx T_c&lt;/math&gt;, the Binder parameter behaves as &lt;math&gt;U(T,L)=b(\epsilon L^{1/\nu})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=\frac{T-T_c}{T}&lt;/math&gt;.

Accordingly, the cumulant may also be used to identify the universality class of the transition by determining the value of the [[critical exponent]] of the [[correlation length]],&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref name= ''KuB''/&gt;

In the [[thermodynamic limit]], at the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], the value of the Binder parameter depends on [[boundary condition]]s, the shape of the system, and [[anisotropy]] of correlations.

[[Image:CO2 pump hg.svg|thumb|350px|Air-sea exchange of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

The '''biological pump''', in its simplest form, is the ocean's biologically driven sequestration of [[carbon]] from the atmosphere to the ocean interior and seafloor sediments.&lt;ref name="Sigman DM 2006. pp. 491-528"&gt;Sigman DM &amp; GH Haug. 2006. The biological pump in the past. In: Treatise on Geochemistry; vol. 6, (ed.). Pergamon Press, pp. 491-528&lt;/ref&gt; It is the part of the [[oceanic carbon cycle]] responsible for the cycling of [[organic matter]] formed mainly by [[phytoplankton]] during [[photosynthesis]] (soft-tissue pump), as well as the cycling of calcium carbonate (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) formed into shells by certain organisms such as [[plankton]] and [[mollusks]] (carbonate pump).&lt;ref name="Hain et al 2014 ToG"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Biological Pump in the Past |journal=Treatise on Geochemistry, 2nd Edition |year=2014 |last=Hain |first=M.P. |last2=Sigman |first2=D.M. |last3=Haug |first3=G.H. |volume=8 |pages=485–517 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-095975-7.00618-5  |url=http://www.mathis-hain.net/resources/Hain_et_al_2014_ToG.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The biological pump can be divided into three distinct phases,&lt;ref name="Rocha CL 2006. pp. 83-111"&gt;De La Rocha CL. 2006. The Biological Pump. In: Treatise on Geochemistry; vol. 6, (ed.). Pergamon Press, pp. 83-111&lt;/ref&gt; the first of which is the production of fixed carbon by planktonic [[phototrophs]] in the [[euphotic]] (sunlit) surface region of the ocean. In these surface waters, [[phytoplankton]] use [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrogen]] (N), [[phosphorus]] (P), and other trace elements ([[barium]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], etc.) during photosynthesis to make [[carbohydrates]], [[lipids]], and [[proteins]]. Some plankton, (e.g. [[coccolithophores]] and [[foraminifera]]) combine calcium (Ca) and dissolved carbonates ([[carbonic acid]] and [[bicarbonate]]) to form a calcium carbonate (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) protective coating.

Once this carbon is fixed into soft or hard tissue, the organisms either stay in the euphotic zone to be recycled as part of the regenerative [[nutrient cycle]] or once they die, continue to the second phase of the biological pump and begin to sink to the ocean floor. The sinking particles will often form aggregates as they sink, greatly increasing the sinking rate. It is this aggregation that gives particles a better chance of escaping predation and decomposition in the water column and eventually make it to the sea floor.

The fixed carbon that is either decomposed by bacteria on the way down or once on the sea floor then enters the final phase of the pump and is remineralized to be used again in [[primary production]]. The particles that escape these processes entirely are sequestered in the sediment and may remain there for millions of years. It is this sequestered carbon that is responsible for ultimately lowering atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Primary production==
The first step in the biological pump is the synthesis of both organic and inorganic carbon compounds by phytoplankton in the uppermost, sunlit layers of the ocean.&lt;ref name="Sigman&amp;Hain2012"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Biological Productivity of the Ocean |journal=Nature Education Knowledge |year=2012 |last=Sigman |first=D.M. |last2=Hain |first2=M.P. |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=1–16 |url=http://www.mathis-hain.net/resources/Sigman_and_Hain_2012_NatureEdu.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-06-01 |quote=The value of NEP depends on the boundaries defined for the ecosystem. If one considers the sunlit surface ocean down to the 1% light level (the “euphotic zone”) over the course of an entire year, then NEP is equivalent to the particulate organic carbon sinking into the dark ocean interior plus the dissolved organic carbon being circulated out of the euphotic zone. In this case, NEP is also often referred to as “export production” (or “new production” (Dugdale &amp; Goering 1967), as discussed below). }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organic compounds in the form of sugars, carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins are synthesized during the process of [[photosynthesis]]:

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + light → CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

In addition to carbon, organic matter found in phytoplankton is composed of nitrogen, phosphorus and various [[trace metals]]. The ratio of carbon to nitrogen and phosphorus varies little and has an average ratio of 106C:16N:1P, known as the [[Redfield ratio]]. Trace metals such as magnesium, cadmium, iron, calcium, barium and copper are orders of magnitude less prevalent in phytoplankton organic material, but necessary for certain metabolic processes and therefore can be limiting nutrients in photosynthesis due to their lower abundance in the water column.&lt;ref name="Rocha CL 2006. pp. 83-111"/&gt;

Oceanic primary production accounts for about half of the carbon fixation carried out on Earth. Approximately 50–60 Pg of carbon are fixed by marine phytoplankton each year despite the fact that they comprise less than 1% of the total photosynthetic biomass on Earth. The majority of this carbon fixation (~80%) is carried out in the open ocean while the remaining amount occurs in the very productive [[upwelling]] regions of the ocean. Despite these productive regions producing 2 to 3 times as much fixed carbon per area, the open ocean accounts for greater than 90% of the ocean area and therefore is the larger contributor.&lt;ref name="Rocha CL 2006. pp. 83-111"/&gt;

==Calcium carbonate==
Carbon is also biologically fixed in the form of [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) used as a protective coating for many planktonic species (coccolithophores, foraminifera) as well as larger marine organisms (mollusk shells). While this form of carbon is not directly taken from the atmospheric budget, it is formed from dissolved forms of carbonate which are in equilibrium with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and then responsible for removing this carbon via sequestration.&lt;ref&gt;Pilson MEQ. 2012. An Introduction to the Chemistry of the Sea. Cambridge University Press, pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

While this process does manage to fix a large amount of carbon, two units of [[alkalinity]] are sequestered for every unit of sequestered carbon, thereby lowering the pH of surface water and raising atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hain et al 2014 ToG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hain et al 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Carbon dioxide effects of Antarctic stratification, North Atlantic Intermediate Water formation, and subantarctic nutrient drawdown during the last ice age: Diagnosis and synthesis in a geochemical box model |journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles |year=2010 |last=Hain |first=M.P. |last2=Sigman |first2=D.M. |last3=Haug |first3=G.H. |volume=24 |pages=1–19 |doi=10.1029/2010GB003790 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-06-01 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The formation and sinking of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; drives a surface to deep [[alkalinity]] gradient which serves to raise the [[partial pressure]] of dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in surface waters and actually raise atmospheric levels. In addition, the sequestration of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; serves to lower overall oceanic [[alkalinity]] and again raise atmospheric levels.&lt;ref name="Sigman DM 2006. pp. 491-528"/&gt;

==Marine snow==
The vast majority of carbon incorporated in organic and inorganic biological matter is formed at the sea surface and then must sink to the ocean floor. A single phytoplankton cell has a sinking rate around 1 m per day and with 4000 m as the average depth of the ocean, it can take over ten years for these cells to reach the ocean floor. However, through processes such as coagulation and expulsion in predator fecal pellets, these cells form aggregates. These aggregates, known as [[marine snow]], have sinking rates orders of magnitude greater than individual cells and complete their journey to the deep in a matter of days.&lt;ref name="Rocha CL 2006. pp. 83-111"/&gt;

Of the 50–60 Pg of carbon fixed annually, roughly 10% leaves the surface mixed layer of the oceans, while less than 0.5% of eventually reaches the sea floor.&lt;ref name="Rocha CL 2006. pp. 83-111"/&gt; Most is retained in regenerated production in the euphotic zone and a significant portion is remineralized in midwater processes during particle sinking. The portion of carbon that leaves the surface mixed layer of the ocean is sometimes considered "sequestered", and essentially removed from contact with the atmosphere for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Passow |first=U. |last2=Carlson |first2=C.A. |date=2012 |title=The biological pump in a high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; world |url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/theme/m470p249.pdf |journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series |publisher=Inter-Research |volume=470 |issue= |pages=249–271 |doi=10.3354/meps09985 |access-date=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, work also finds that, in regions such as the [[Southern Ocean]], much of this carbon can quickly (within decades) come back into contact with the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robinson |first=J. |last2=Popova |first2=E.E. |last3=Yool |first3=A. |last4=Srokosz |first4=M.A. |last5=Lampitt |first5=R.S. |last6=Blundell |first6=J.R. |date=2014 |title=How deep is deep enough?

These cliffs are made almost entirely of the plates of buried coccolithophores.

==Quantification==
As the biological pump plays an important role in the Earth's carbon cycle, significant effort is spent quantifying its strength.  However, because they occur as a result of poorly constrained ecological interactions usually at depth, the processes that form the biological pump are difficult to measure.  A common method is to estimate primary production fuelled by [[nitrate]] and [[ammonium]] as these nutrients have different sources that are related to the remineralisation of sinking material.  From these it is possible to derive the so-called [[f-ratio]], a proxy for the local strength of the biological pump.  Applying the results of local studies to the global scale is complicated by the role the ocean's circulation plays in different ocean regions.&lt;ref name=marinov06&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marinov|first=I. |author2=Gnanadesikan, A. |author3=Toggweiler, J.

The biological pump has a physico-chemical counterpart known as the [[solubility pump]].

==Anthropogenic changes==

It was recently determined that [[coccolithophore]] concentrations in the North Atlantic have increased by an order of magnitude since the 1960s and an increase in absorbed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as temperature, were modeled to be the most likely cause of this increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rivero-Calle |first=Sara |last2=Gnanadesikan |first2=Anand |last3=Castillo |first3=Carlos E.

Changes in land use, the [[combustion]] of [[fossil fuel]]s, and the production of [[cement]] have led to an increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in the atmosphere.

However, the biological pump is not believed to play a significant role in the net uptake of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by oceans. This is because the biological pump is primarily limited by the availability of light and nutrients, and not by carbon.  This is in contrast to the situation on land, where elevated atmospheric concentrations of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may increase [[primary production]] because land [[plant]]s are able to improve their water-use efficiency (= decrease [[transpiration]]) when CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is easier to obtain.&lt;ref name=cox00&gt;Cox, P.

However, [[climate change]] may affect the biological pump in the future by warming and [[stratification (water)|stratifying]] the surface ocean.  It is believed that this could decrease the supply of nutrients to the euphotic zone, reducing primary production there.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25183">'''Community fingerprinting''' is a set of [[molecular biology]] techniques that can be used to quickly profile the [[biodiversity|diversity]] of a [[microorganism|microbial]] community. Rather than directly identifying or counting individual cells in an environmental sample, these techniques show how many variants of a [[gene]] are present. In general, it is assumed that each different gene variant represents a different type of microbe. Community fingerprinting is used by [[microbiologist]]s studying a variety of microbial systems (e.g. marine, freshwater, soil, and human microbial communities) to measure biodiversity or track changes in community structure over time. The method analyzes environmental samples by assaying genomic [[DNA]]. This approach offers an alternative to [[microbiological culture|microbial culturing]], which is important because most microbes cannot be cultured in the laboratory.&lt;ref name="Madigan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Madigan|first=M.T.|title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=San Francisco, CA|edition=12th |author2=J.M. Martinko |author3=P.V. Dunlap |author4=D.P. Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community fingerprinting does not result in identification of individual microbe species; instead, it presents an overall picture of a microbial community.  These methods are now largely being replaced by high throughput sequencing, such as targeted [[microbiome]] analysis (e.g., 16s rRNA sequencing) and [[metagenomics]].

==Use==
A fingerprinting analysis begins with an environmental sample (e.g. seawater or soil), from which total DNA is extracted. (Total DNA contains a mix of genetic material from all the microbes present in the sample.) A particular gene or DNA region is then selected as a target for analysis, under the assumption that each microbe species will have a different gene variant (also called a "[[phylotype]]"). Different methods (see below) can be used to visualize the phylotypes present in a sample. Because the aim of community fingerprinting is to gain an overall understanding of community structure, it is a particularly useful technique for analyzing [[Time series|time-series]] data collected from the field. For example, one could study the pattern of microbial [[ecological succession|succession]] in a habitat, or one could examine the response of a microbial community to an environmental perturbation, such as the release of a pollutant. Depending on what information is desired, different genes may be targeted. The most common are small subunit [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) genes, such as [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]]. These genes are frequently used in microbial [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analyses, so well-established techniques exist for their study. Other genes of interest might be those that are key in various metabolic processes.&lt;ref name="Madigan" /&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The advantages of community fingerprinting are that it can be performed quickly and relatively cheaply, and the analyses can accommodate a large number of samples simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Marsh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsh|first=T.L.|title=Culture-independent microbial community analysis with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism|journal=Methods in Enzymology|year=2005|volume=397|pages=308–329|doi=10.1016/s0076-6879(05)97018-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=A.|author2=L.A.

Also, fingerprinting techniques do not require one to have ''a priori'' sequence data for organisms in a sample.
A disadvantage of community fingerprinting is that it results in largely qualitative, not quantitative data.&lt;ref name="Osborn"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osborn|first=A.M. |author2=E.R.B. Moore |author3=K.N.

Also, community fingerprinting does not directly identify taxa in an environmental sample, though the data output from certain techniques (e.g. [[DGGE]]) can be analyzed further if one desires identification. Some authors point to poor reproducibility of results for certain fingerprinting methods,&lt;ref name="Grant" /&gt; while other authors have criticized the inaccuracy of abundance estimates and the inability of some techniques to capture the presence of rare taxa.&lt;ref name="Bent"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bent|first=S.J. |author2=J.D.

==Techniques==
This section presents three methods of community fingerprinting.

===Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP)===

[[Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (T-RFLP) is a method that uses [[fluorescence|fluorescently]]-labeled DNA fragments to produce a community fingerprint.&lt;ref name="Marsh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=W.-T. |author2=T. L. Marsh |author3=H. Cheng |author4=L.J. Forney|title=Characterization of microbial  diversity by determining terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms of genes  encoding 16S rRNA|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=1997|volume=63|issue=11|pages=4517–4522}}&lt;/ref&gt; This section presents a brief explanation of T-RFLP ''in the specific context of community fingerprinting''. For a more detailed explanation, refer to the [[Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism|T-RFLP]] article.

====Procedure====
To perform T-RFLP (Figure 1), one must select a target gene (e.g. the 16S rRNA gene) to amplify by [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]. At least one [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]] used in the PCR reaction is fluorescently labeled at the [[directionality (molecular biology)|5´]] end. After PCR amplification, each copied DNA segment carries the fluorescent label. Next, [[restriction enzyme]]s are used to cut the amplified DNA at specific [[recognition site]]s. The underlying assumption is that each microbe in the sample will have a different sequence on the target gene, so a restriction enzyme will cut each microbe's DNA in a different place. (Each different restriction site is considered to represent a single [[operational taxonomic unit]] [OTU]). Thus, the enzyme will produce one fragment length for each type of microbe present in the sample. The result of digestion is a set of restriction fragments of different lengths, each of which is fluorescently labeled at one end. These are known as "terminal fragments" because they are labeled at the end where the PCR primer attached.  (The unlabeled ends are not recorded in the final analysis.) Next, the fragments are separated by size through either [[gel electrophoresis|gel]] or [[capillary electrophoresis]]. Laser detection captures the size and fluorescence-intensity patterns of the terminal fragments. DNA standards of known size and fluorescence are included in the analysis as references. By setting a minimum threshold for fluorescence, background noise will be excluded.&lt;ref name="Osborn" /&gt;
[[File:Step-by-step procedure of using T-RFLP analysis in microbiology.pdf|thumb|right|Figure 1. Steps of Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis for a single microbial community with 3 phylotypes]]

====Data output and interpretation====
The output of the laser detection step is an [[electropherogram]] that shows a series of peaks, with fragment length on the horizontal axis and fluorescence intensity on the vertical axis (Figure 1). A second output&lt;ref name="Osborn" /&gt; is a data table that lists the migration time of the fragments, the size in [[base pairs]] of each peak, and the height of and area under each peak.

The theoretical basis of T-RFLP assumes that peaks at different positions along the horizontal axis represent different types of organisms (or OTUs). The area under each fluorescence intensity peak is a proxy for relative abundance of each phylotype in the community. However, a number of caveats must be taken into account. Different types of organisms may share a restriction site in the gene of interest; if that is the case, these organisms would not be distinguished as different peaks on the electropherogram. Furthermore, area under a peak represents relative abundance rather than absolute abundance, and there are biases in abundance measurement and PCR amplification. For example, organisms that are scarce in the original total DNA sample will not be amplified enough to be detected in the final analysis.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt; This leads to underestimation of community diversity. Liu ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt; cite other possible factors that may distort results, including "differences in gene copy number between species and biases introduced during cell lysis, DNA extraction, and PCR amplification" (p.&amp;nbsp;4521). For those who seek detailed technical information, Marsh&lt;ref name="Marsh" /&gt; provides a catalog of potential biases that could be introduced in each step of the T-RFLP process.

====Advantages and disadvantages{{anchor|Advantages and disadvantages of T-RFLP}}====
The major advantages of T-RFLP are that it is fast and can easily accommodate many samples.&lt;ref name="Marsh" /&gt; Also, the visual output simplifies comparison of community structure patterns across different samples. A disadvantage is the broad, qualitative nature of the data output, which must be interpreted with the above caveats in mind. Also, direct identification of microbes in a sample is not possible through T-RFLP.

====Applications{{anchor|Applications of T-RFLP}}====

Chantawannakul|title=T-RFLP  analysis of bacterial communities in the midguts of ''Apis mellifera'' and ''Apis cerana'' honey  bees in Thailand|journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology|year=2012|volume=79|pages=273–281|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6941.2011.01216.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; used T-RFLP to assess the microbial gut community, or microbiome, in two species of honeybees in Thailand. They found that the two species harbor different microbial communities and that the microbiome changes over the lifetime of the bees.

Joo ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Joo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joo|first=S. |author2=S.-R. Lee |author3=S. Park |title=Monitoring of phytoplankton community structure using  terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP)|journal=Journal of Microbiological Methods|year=2010|volume=81|pages=61–68|doi=10.1016/j.mimet.2010.01.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  tested T-RFLP as a method for phytoplankton monitoring. The authors collected environmental water samples from reservoirs in a time series. After comparison of samples with known terminal restriction fragments (from a database built from cultures), they concluded that T-RFLP can be used effectively as a technique for monitoring ''changes'' in the phytoplankton community. However, diversity and abundance estimates were found to be less accurate than those found through other methods.

===Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)===

====Procedure====
[[Dgge|Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)]] is a microbial fingerprinting technique that separates [[amplicon]]s of roughly the same size based on sequence properties&lt;ref name="Madigan" /&gt; (Figure 2). These properties dictate the threshold at which DNA denatures. The DGGE gel uses a gradient DNA denaturant (a mixture of urea and formamide), or a linear temperature gradient.&lt;ref name=Muyzer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muyzer|first=G.|title=DGGE/TGGE a method for identifying genes from natural ecosystems|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|year=1999|volume=2|pages=317–322|doi=10.1016/s1369-5274(99)80055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the fragment reaches its melting point (threshold of enough denaturant), it stops moving. This is due to the fact that a partially melted double-stranded DNA can no longer migrate through the gel.&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=S.G.|author2=L.S. Lerman|title=DNA fragments differing by single base-pair substitutions are separated in denaturing electrophoreseis analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified genes coding for 16S rRN|journal=PNAS|year=1983|volume=80|number=6|pages=1579–1583|doi= 10.1073/pnas.80.6.1579 |pmc=393645}}&lt;/ref&gt; A GC clamp (about 40 bases with high GC content) is used as a special [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] to anchor the [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] fragments together once they have [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]].&lt;ref name=Rettedal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rettedal|first=E.A.|author2=S.

[[File:Step-by-step procedure of using DGGE analysis in microbiology.pdf|thumb|right|Figure 2. The microbial fingerprinting technique called Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. The diagram demonstrates how samples from different microbial communities can be compared.]]

====Data output and interpretation====
Each lane on a gel represents one microbial community. The shared bands among the samples are the same size and roughly the same position on the gel. The gene variants that are not shared amongst microbial community samples do not match up horizontally with others. For example, if the gene of interest is 16S rRNA, as it was when the technique was first described, the PCR-amplified fragments will be in the same vertical location because they are all roughly the same size.&lt;ref name=Muyzer2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muyzer|first=G. |author2=E.C. De Waal |author3=A.G. Uitterlinden |title=Profiling of complex microbial populations by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified genes coding for 16S rRN|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=1993|volume=59|pages=695–700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another target gene may have greater variation in length, but the denaturant gradient uses a second element (of melting point) to further distinguish between the samples. The DGGE gel will separate genes of the same size based on base sequence.

This technique shows to what extent microbial communities are the same or different in taxonomic composition. Each band in a different location on the gel represents a different phylotype (one unique sequence of a phylogenetic marker gene).&lt;ref name="Madigan" /&gt; For microbial communities this method profiles many individual 16S rRNA sequences.&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ward|first=D.M.|author2=M. J. Ferris |author3=S. C. Nold |author4=M. M. Bateson |title=A natural view of microbial biodiversity within hot spring cyanobacterial mat communities|journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|year=1998|volume=62|pages=1353–1370|pmid=9841675 |pmc=98949}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of bands at differing horizontal positions can be used to estimate the level of biodiversity in that sample and infer phylogenetic affiliation.&lt;ref name="Muyzer" /&gt; In order to know more about phylogenetic affiliation, one could excise those bands from the gel and then sequence them.

The use of denaturing profile serves as a way to separate DNA fragments of similar sizes. This is beneficial in assessing microbial diversity due to the fact that the 16S rRNA gene does not vary much in size across bacterial phyla. The DGGE gel provides a quick way of looking at biodiversity in a microbial sample and does not preclude the option of sequencing the bands of interest. This method does not require that the microbes be cultured in the lab and does not require any sequence data needed to design probes for hybridization methods.&lt;ref name="Muyzer" /&gt; The main disadvantage is that this is a qualitative assessment of biodiversity and one must sequence the genes in order to make inferences about the phylogenetic relatedness. Another disadvantage is that the GC clamp can be variable each time it is synthesized. This leads to the potential for different DGGE profiles for the same 16S rRNA sequence.&lt;ref name="Rettedal" /&gt;

====Applications{{anchor|Applications of DGGE}}====
Stephen ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Stephen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stephen|first=J.R. |author2=G. A. Kowalchuk |author3=M-A. V. Bruns |author4=A. E. McCaig |author5=C. J. Phillips |author6=T. M. Embley |author7=J. I. Prosse |title=Analysis of β-subgroup Proteobacterial ammonia oxidizer populations in soil by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis and hierarchical phylogenetic probing|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=1998|volume=64|pages=2958–2965}}&lt;/ref&gt; utilized DGGE for a rapid analysis of Proteobacteria in soil. They obtained an initial assessment of microbial diversity in their environmental samples from soil maintained for 36 years at the various pH values. They combined DGGE and hybridization techniques by probing the DNA fragments to obtain more detail about the natural populations. In this study, they were looking at a group of closely related bacterial types, all autotrophic β–proteobacterial ammonia oxidizers. The 16S rDNA samples yielded ambiguous overlapping bands when run out on a gel. The ambiguous overlapping bands were separated with cluster-specific radiolabelled probes, which yielded information of the relative abundance of the different genotypes in samples.

Ward ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Ward" /&gt; examined cyanobacterial mat communities in a Yellowstone hot spring by using DGGE analysis of 16S rRNA gene segments of aerobic chemoorganotrophic populations. DGGE allowed them to profile the community gaining new insight to diversity. They characterized the bands of interest by purifying and sequencing and detected many lineages previously unknown to be present.

===(Automated) ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) ===

====Procedure====

(Automated) [[ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis]], or (A)RISA (Figure 3), takes advantage of the fact that prokaryotic DNA encodes for two highly conserved genes, the 16SrRNA gene and the 23SrRNA gene. These encode the small and large subunit genes in the rRNA operon. Between these two genes, there is an internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Due to the fact it is non-coding for proteins, it is a highly variable nucleotide sequence and length. Once DNA is isolated from a community, PCR amplifies this spacer region. The fragments can be run out on a gel (RISA), or the fluorescent primers can be translated into peaks in abundance of the different fragments lengths on an [[electropherogram]] (ARISA).&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=M.M.|author2=E.W. Triplett|title=Automated approach for ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis of microbial diversity and its application to freshwater bacterial communities|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=1999|volume=65|pages=4630–4636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ranjard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranjard|first=L. |author2=F.

====Data output and interpretation====
Due to variable non-coding regions, the output for RISA is a gel with different banding patterns, and output for ARISA is an electropherogram  with different peaks (similar to T-RFLP).

The brightness of the fluorescently labeled primers correlates to how prevalent that bacterial type is in the community. The banding pattern on the gel can be interpreted as a community-specific profile. Each DNA band or peak indicates at least one representative of that organism.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; In RISA, the bands on gel that do not match up in length represent different organisms in the community because they have different spacer regions between the two highly conserved genes. The electropherogram shows peaks correlating to the relative abundance of that spacer region in the sample.

====Advantages and disadvantages{{anchor|Advantages and disadvantages of ARISA}}====
ARISA can have a higher resolution in detecting microbial diversity as compared to [[Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism|T-RFLP]].&lt;ref name=Danovaro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danovaro|first=R. |author2=G. M. Luna |author3=A. Dell’Anno |author4=B. Pietrangeli|title=Comparison of two fingerprinting techniques, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, for determination of bacterial diversity in aquatic environments|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|year=2006|volume=72|pages=5982–5989|doi=10.1128/aem.01361-06 |pmid=16957219 |pmc=1563681}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fingerprinting method is a quick and sensitive method to estimate microbial diversity. The observed length heterogeneities can be compared to databases for overlap with culturable organisms.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; One can design phylum-level oligonucleotide primers to get at questions regarding phylogenetic groups.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; One disadvantage to ARISA is the fact that a single organism may contribute more than one peak to the community profile. Unrelated organisms can also have similar spacer lengths, which leads to underestimates of community diversity. Due to these biases, researchers often use this method on multiple samples from each community in order to get an average assessment.

====Applications{{anchor|Applications of ARISA}}====
Ranjard ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Ranjard" /&gt; discuss several examples of types of studies in which RISA can be used. They cite several studies that have used this technique to fingerprint bacterial communities following such disturbances as antibiotic treatment, mercury stress and deforestation. They also demonstrated the successful use of ARISA for characterizing fungal communities, which is an aspect of microbial ecology that remains to be fully explored.

Schloss ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Schloss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schloss|first=P.D. |author2=A.G. Hay |author3=D.B. Wilson |author4=L.P. Walker|title=Tracking temporal changes in bacterial community fingerprints during the initial stages of compostin|journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology|year=2003|volume=46|pages=1–9|doi=10.1016/s0168-6496(03)00153-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a study examining environmental variables and linking them to changes in the microbial ecology of a compost pile. They used ARISA to profile the community structure and look at microbial succession over stages in the composting process. They took DNA samples and sequenced the 16S rRNA gene to identify community members at the different phases of the process. Then they used ARISA to look at community-wide changes and then matched up the 16S rRNA gene sequence with the most common ARISA fragments to identify these microbial community members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17137">The '''conservation and restoration of clocks''' refers to the care given to a clock to either prevent or resolve issues faced during its life cycle. The variety of materials from which a clock may be constructed and the complexity of [[clockwork]] warrant such care to be taken by a clock owner so that a clock can continue to function.

== Preventive conservation ==
Proper handling, suitable storage and display environments, and regular maintenance can together prevent issues from arising and impacting a clock’s sustainability. Such controls can extend the life of a clock.

=== Handling ===
Certain precautionary measures taken by a clock handler can deny opportunities for damage to occur:
[[File:Pendulum_removed_from_clockwork.jpg|thumb|right|150x300px|Pendulum removed from clockwork.]]
* Loose items worn by a handler have the potential to come into contact with and cause damage to a clock. Removal of these items prior to clock handling can lower the risk of damage. 
* Wearing “[...] cotton or rubber gloves when handling the metal portions of the clock” &lt;ref name=Fahey&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fahey|first1=Mary M.|title=The Care and Preservation of Clocks|url=http://www.thehenryford.org/research/caring/clocks.aspx|website=Benson Ford Research Center|publisher=The Henry Ford|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; can limit opportunities for transfer of contaminants from hands to clock surfaces. 
* [[Pendulum]] damage during clock movement can be prevented by either removing the pendulum or fixing it within the interior of the clock via a latch or padding prior to clock movement.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; This can also prevent damage to other interior components.
* A clock "[...] should always be grasped at its most sturdy area" &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; and moved from one location to the next on its back. 
* The correlation of the size of a clock with the number of people moving it can ensure the safety of the clock. A small, mantle clock for example may only require one mover, while a tall clock can necessitate a number of movers to safely carry it to another location.

=== Storage and display ===
Proper storage and display mechanisms can work to ensure a clock’s safety. The use of a solid, sturdy surface when storing or displaying a clock can prevent it from falling on a hard surface. A wall clock for example requires a secure attachment "[...] to a wall if accidents are to be avoided and clocks are to run properly.” &lt;ref name=ICON&gt;{{cite web|title=Care and Conservation of Clocks|url=http://www.conservationregister.com/PIcon-CareClocks.asp|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|website=Conservation Register|publisher=The Institute of Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motion sensitive lighting and use of non-direct light sources can limit the amount of light and heat withstood by a clock, both of which are sources of clock damage. A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An [[HVAC]] system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.

==== Humidity and temperature levels ====
The [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock’s condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.
:a. '''Wood clocks'''
:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;
:b. '''Metal clocks'''
:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;

=== Maintenance ===
Regular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation.

==== Condition checks ====
Visual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. 
:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''
:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock’s history, as “[...] various “dirt” or “salt” deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].” &lt;ref name=Moss&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth//moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as “the abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of “sandpaper [...].” &lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined “[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; 
:b. '''Winding and setting'''
:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.

== Typical types of damage ==
Damage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused.

=== Human interaction ===

:a. '''Mishandling'''
:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock’s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving “unsightly and potentially damaging marks.” &lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock “[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.
:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''
:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as “[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily”,&lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; as well as by turning the key one too many times. 
:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.&lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, “Rather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.” &lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; 
:c. '''Unsuitable storage or display''' 
:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock’s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.
:d. '''Improper cleaning and polishing'''
:Many cleaners and polishers contain properties that “[...] have been proven to age poorly.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; Resultantly, the use of such cleaners and polishers can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called [[Stress Corrosion Cracking]].&lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can “[...] remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.” &lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; 
:e. '''Improper lubrication'''
:Attempts by non-professionals to lubricate or repair clockwork can lead to serious damage and loss of clock functionality. A lubricant applied without first cleaning and polishing clockwork to remove the previous lubricant and contaminants can result in wear rather than prevent it.&lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; The combination of the newly applied lubricant with the previous lubricant often results in “[...] an unwanted chemical reaction between the two lubricants [...].” &lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; A careless lubricant choice can result in the use of inappropriate or "Poor-quality oil" on clockwork, which "can become sticky leading to mechanical problems." &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; The inexperience of a non-professional can also lead to “the use of too much oil, or oil in the wrong place” &lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; during attempts to lubricate clockwork. The application of too much of a lubricant can be damaging because it “[...] usually causes the lubrication to run out of the bearing and by capillary action will cause the bearing to go dry.” &lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; Totally ignoring the lubrication needs of clockwork can be jeopardizing not only because of lubricant degradation, but because of the acidic nature of the organic lubricants often used in antique clocks.&lt;ref name=Moss /&gt;

=== Natural causes ===

:a. '''Humidity and temperature'''
:The amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. “[...] extremes in temperature and humidity” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near "a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements." &lt;ref name=ICON /&gt; 
:b. '''Pests'''
:Clocks are as susceptible to pest damage as any other object constructed from organic materials. Pests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:
:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such “[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;
:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;
:c. '''Light'''
:Over-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration “[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or “alligatored” appearance.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;
:d. '''Contaminants'''
[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]
:Contaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  
:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock’s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. 
:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.

=== Types of clock damage ===
Damage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.

==== Wood damage ====
Due to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.&lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; Such changes in character from the wood’s original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include “[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives." &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;

==== Metal damage ====
Similar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This “[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt;

==== Finish or paint damage ====
Finish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock’s surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products “can actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.” &lt;ref name=Fahey /&gt; Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.

==== Interior or clockwork damage ====
Clockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.

== Conservation and restoration ==
Interventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.

=== Conservators ===

A [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to “[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].” &lt;ref name=Moss /&gt; Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as “Sometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].” &lt;ref name=NAWCC&gt;{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.

=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===
[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]]. In starting the project, examination of the clock revealed that "The automata and clock elements seem to be running, but struggling, and the music sounds as though it needs a few extra hands to help play its tune." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=Anglesey Abbey’s Pagoda Clock|url=http://westdeanconservation.com/2012/06/05/anglesey-abbeys-pagoda-clock/|date=5 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clock was then disassembled, and care was taken to document information about each of the over 600 components both textually and photographically, including measurements and where each component fits within the clock. "After examination, each component was cleaned and dried, wrapped in acid-free tissue, and stored with the catalogue number." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=The Pagoda Part 2|url=http://westdeanconservation.com/2012/06/28/the-pagoda-part-2/|date=28 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]] and [[topology]], '''crumpling''' is the process whereby a sheet of paper or other two-dimensional [[manifold]] undergoes disordered [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] to yield a three-dimensional structure comprising a random network of [[Face_(geometry)#Ridge_or_.28n-2.29-face|ridge]]s and [[facet]]s with variable density. The geometry of crumpled structures is the subject of some interest the mathematical community within the discipline of topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Cerda | first1=Enrique | last2=Chaieb |first2=Sahraoui |last3=Melo | first3=Francisco| last4=Mahadevan| first4=L |title=Conical dislocations in crumpling | journal= nature | year= 1999| volume=401| doi=10.1038/43395| bibcode=1999Natur.401...46C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crumpled paper balls have been studied and found to exhibit surprisingly complex structures with [[compressive strength]] resulting from [[friction]]al interactions at [[Local property|locally]] flat facets between folds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cambou| first1=Anne Dominique |last2=Narayanan | first2=Menon| title=Three-dimensional structure of a sheet crumpled into a ball.| journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year=2011 | volume=108 |issue=36 |pages=14741–14745|arxiv=1203.5826|bibcode=2011PNAS..10814741C|doi=10.1073/pnas.1019192108|pmc=3169141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unusually high compressive strength of crumpled structures relative to their density is of interest in the disciplines of [[materials science]] and [[mechanical engineering]].

== Significance of crumpling ==

The packing of a sheet by crumpling is a complex phenomenon that depends on material parameters and the packing protocol. Thus the crumpling behaviour of foil, paper and poly-membranes differs significantly and can be interpreted on the basis of material foldability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Habibi| first1=M |last2=Bonn | first2=D| title=Effect of the material properties on the crumpling of a thin sheet.| journal= Soft matter |year=2017 | volume=3 |pages=4029}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high compressive strength exhibited by dense crumple formed [[cellulose]] paper is of interest towards impact dissipation applications and has  been proposed as an approach to [[Paper recycling|utilising waste paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Mechanical properties in crumple-formed paper derived materials subjected to compression| journal= Heilyon |year=2017 | volume=3 |issue=6| pages=e00329 | url= http://www.heliyon.com/article/e00329/}} &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">'''Cytosolic ciliogenesis''', otherwise '''cytoplasmic ciliogenesis''', is a type of [[ciliogenesis]] where the [[cilium]] [[axoneme]] is formed in the [[cytoplasm]] or becomes exposed to the cytoplasm.&lt;ref name="sdm"&gt;''Shared and Distinct Mechanisms of Compartmentalized and Cytosolic Ciliogenesis''. Avidor-Reiss T, Leroux MR. Curr Biol. 2015 Dec 7;25(23):R1143-50. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2015.11.001 ([http://0-resolver.ebscohost.com.carlson.utoledo.edu/openurl?sid=Entrez%3aPubMed&amp;id=pmid%3a26654377&amp;site=ftf-live online version)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cytosolic ciliogenesis is divided into three types: Primary cytosolic cilia are formed by exposing the [[axoneme]] of compartmentalized cilium (formed initially by [[compartmentalized ciliogenesis]]) to the cytoplasm. This type of cilia is found in the sperm of human and other [[mammals]]. Secondary cytosolic cilia are formed in parallels to the formation of the typical compartmentalized cilium. One end of the axoneme is exposed to the cytoplasm as the other end of the axoneme is formed as compartmentalized cilia. This type of cilia is found in [[insects]]. Tertiary cytosolic cilia are axonemes that form directly in the cytoplasm. This type of cilia is found in [[Plasmodium]] (the [[malaria]] parasite).&lt;ref name="sdm" /&gt;

== History ==
The term Cytosolic Ciliogenesis was coined in 2004 as part of a study that identified a large set of ciliogenesis genes &lt;ref&gt;.Avidor-Reiss T, Maer AM, Koundakjian E, Polyanovsky A, Keil T, Subramaniam S, Zuker CS. Decoding cilia function: defining specialized genes required for compartmentalized cilia biogenesis.

It was found that a subset of genes that are thought to be essential for compartmentalized cilia are not essential to form the sperm flagellum. Since the axoneme of this flagellum was exposed to the cytoplasm it was named Cytosolic Ciliogenesis &lt;ref&gt; Avidor-Reiss, T., and M.R. Leroux. 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15749">'''Drugs and prostitution''' have been documented to have a direct correlation. In 1978, a study showed that use of drugs by prostitutes appeared to be an "Adaptation and commitment to a deviant social role".

Drug use tended to predate prostitution among low level prostitutes with the connection most likely due to economic necessity. Low level prostitutes tended to use depressants, specifically [[heroin]], as the drug of choice. High class prostitution showed that prostitution predates drug use with stimulants being the drug of choice.&lt;ref name=alcoholrehab&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alcoholrehab.com/drug-addiction/crime-and-substance-abuse/ |title=Crime and Substance Abuse |publisher=DARA Thailand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1994 study among South London prostitutes showed links between sexual behavior, severity of dependence, and use of heroin, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] but rarely, [[cocaine]].&lt;ref name=pmid7950854&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1994.tb03356.x |pmid=7950854 |title=Sexual behaviour and its relationship to drug-taking among prostitutes in south London |journal=Addiction |volume=89 |issue=8 |pages=961–70 |year=1994 |last1=Gossop |first1=Michael |last2=Powis |first2=Beverly |last3=Griffiths |first3=Paul |last4=Strang |first4=John }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug use==
In the case of street prostitutes, estimates reveal that between 40 and 85 percent of all street prostitutes are drug users.&lt;ref name=alcoholrehab/&gt;

A study conducted by the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse in the UK, has suggested that as 95% of women that are involved with street prostitution in the UK are [[heroin]] or [[crack cocaine]] users.&lt;ref name=Gilchrist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nta.nhs.uk/uploads/drug-users-involved-in-prostitution.pdf |title=Drug users involved in prostitution: impact on health |last=Gilchrist |first=Gail |publisher=Public Health England |access-date=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitutes who reported a problem with drug use had begun the use of hard drugs at an earlier age (16.2 years old). Because of these early experiences with drugs, these people often begin sex work early in their lives. The average age for people who engage in sex work with [[drug abuse]] was five months younger than those whom have had no problem with drugs (19 years and 2 months old, instead of 19 years 7 months old).&lt;ref name="Cusick et al 2003"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Linda |last1=Cusick |first2=Anthea |last2=Martin |first3=Tiggey |last3=May |url=http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs04/hors268.pdf |title=Vulnerability and involvement in drug use and sex work |year=2003 |work=Home Office Research Study No. 268 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100712095244/http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs04/hors268.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug use is also linked with outdoor cruising, which involves cruising around a street looking for clients, and independent drifting which means prostitution from personal phones or [[Crack house|crack houses]]. 84% of these workers, whom work in this sector, reported problems with drug use, in comparison to the 13%, who work in an indoor-associated escort-type agency, such as a sauna, massage parlor, flat or [[Escort agency]].&lt;ref name="Cusick et al 2003"/&gt;

According to a survey conducted by the Center for Problem-Orientated Policing, more than 70% of [[Sex work|sex workers]] over 25 have taken [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[amphetamines]], [[cocaine]], crack cocaine and heroin. Furthermore, for sex workers at 16 to 19 years of age, over 70% of them have experienced cannabis, cocaine, and crack cocaine.&lt;ref name="Cusick et al 2003"/&gt;

Prostitutes also use mind-altering drugs such as [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[PCP (drug)|PCP]], and [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]; in addition to [[psychoactive drug]]s such as [[Valium]] and [[Pethidine]]. Researchers have found the choice of drug to be important to the prostitute in serving real or perceived functions.&lt;ref name=Flowers2005p62&gt;{{cite book |title=The Prostitution of Women and Girls |last=Flowers |first=Ronald |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |date=August 5, 2005 |isbn=978-0-7864-2448-1 |page=62 |quote=In the case of heroin, it may be used to adjust to a life which they resent, as it increases peoples ability to withstand emotional and physical stress.

Cocaine and other [[stimulant]]s have also been reported to increase the confidence of streetwalkers' ability to talk to strangers, and allow for these sex workers to maintain their energy levels. Moreover, New York call-girls consume alcohol as means of protecting themselves from insults, both physically and emotionally.&lt;ref name=Flowers2005p62/&gt; In addition, certain drugs, such as [[MDMA]], are known to increase their effects on [[sex]]. Someone who wishes to enhance their sexual experience may turn to drugs in order to increase endurance, intensify sensations, and prolong the encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bradfordhealth.com/the-link-between-drug-addiction-and-sexual-addiction/ |title=The Link Between Drug Addiction and Sexual Addiction |publisher=Bradford Health |access-date=21 November 2016|date=2013-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the street level, [[pimp]]s often use drugs to exert control over prostitutes. Many pimps are also drug dealers and attract and lure women with free drugs and the promise of a high-rolling lifestyle. Pimps intend on getting these women addicted to drugs, and often target those who are at increased risk of [[addiction]]. Women targeted in this way may have financial or emotional problems, come from [[Dysfunctional family|dysfunctional families]], or have a drug addiction already. Once addicted, they will continue seeking drugs from the pimp, who will then inform the girl that he cannot continue financing their addiction without compensation. Because of the addiction, a person will try to find ways in which to finance and satisfy their [[Substance dependence|dependence]], and in many cases their dependence impairs their judgments, making these people more susceptible to becoming sex workers, and thus that addiction keeps them enslaved to the industry.&lt;ref name=addictionhelpcenter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.addictionhelpcenter.com/is-there-a-connection-between-prostitution-and-drug-or-alcohol-addiction/ |title=Is There a Connection between Prostitution and Drug or Alcohol Addiction? |publisher=Addiction Help Center |access-date=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, although some sex workers begin work as a result of their addictions, some people turn to prostitution after [[drug addictions]] have ruined their lives, and left them with very few alternatives to support themselves otherwise.&lt;ref name=addictionhelpcenter /&gt;

==Factors associated with vulnerability==
The use of drugs among prostitutes is very high. A study was conducted with 200 street prostitutes to determine when prostitutes first get involved with drugs. The results showed that 55% of the subjects reported becoming addicted to drugs before they became prostitutes, 30% reported becoming addicted after becoming a prostitute, and 15% became addicted at the same time they became a prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02791072.1982.10471928 |pmid=7143150 |title=Substance Abuse and Prostitution |journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=193–7 |year=1982 |last1=Silbert |first1=Mimi H. |last2=Pines |first2=Ayala M. |last3=Lynch |first3=Teri }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also revealed that the women's families often had alcohol and drug abuse throughout their lives. Substance abuse can lead someone towards prostitution and prostitution can lead someone to substance abuse. Prostitutes use many different drugs to help them deal with their problems. [[Marijuana]] is used to help relax, [[heroin]] is used to help increase emotional and physical stress tolerances, and [[cocaine]] and other stimulants are used to increase energy and confidence, so they are able to bring in more clients.&lt;ref name=Flowers2005p62/&gt; When prostitutes use drugs, they often become addicted and have to continue prostituting to continue funding their addiction.

There are some common factors between prostitutes who are involved with drug use. If they frequently have unprotected sex, if they are [[HIV/AIDS]] positive or have any other sexually acquired infections, if they have any mental health issues or have recently undergone mental health treatment, if they are homeless, or if they suffered physical and sexual abuse in adulthood they are much more likely to develop a substance abuse problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2004.09.003 |pmid=15893098 |title=Comparison of drug use and psychiatric morbidity between prostitute and non-prostitute female drug users in Glasgow, Scotland |journal=Addictive Behaviors |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=1019–23 |year=2005 |last1=Gilchrist |first1=Gail |last2=Gruer |first2=Laurence |last3=Atkinson |first3=Jacqueline |url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/4186/1/Atkinson4186.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug users with multiple mental problems have higher rates of sharing injection needles with other people, lower rates of using condoms, having sex with multiple partners, sex trading, and having sex with an injecting drug user. Depression is also associated with drug use and prostitution.&lt;ref name=Gilchrist/&gt; There are also trapping factors: injecting any kind of substance into their body, using hard drugs such as [[crack cocaine]] or [[methamphetamine]], taking part in sex work while underage, working outdoors or in multiple areas, and having any convictions. These factors "trap" a person into the life they are in, especially if multiple of the factors effect them, making it much harder for them to escape their situation. The people most vulnerable to prostitution are those that have experienced these factors.&lt;ref name="Cusick et al 2003"/&gt;

==The way behavioral therapies are used==
Behavioral therapies help patients change their initial attitudes and behaviors that are related to drug use. For example, patients should be aware of the severe consequences of drugs after the therapies. In addition, a successful behavioral therapy should also help patients build up a set of healthy habits and lifestyle, as guiding and educating them is also an essential component of behavioral therapy. What's more, for an effective behavioral treatment, it is important to pair it with proper medication. As behavioral treatment mainly cures the patients mentally, while medication cures the patients physically. They are dependent on each other and should be used towards the patients simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://luxury.rehabs.com/drug-addiction/prostituting/|title=When a Friend or Family Member is Prostituting for Drugs|website=luxury.rehabs.com|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some principles of effective treatment==
* As situations may differ significantly, there is no panacea that can cure every disease, including mental disorder.
* Treatment must be able to be easily and quickly accessed as emergent  situations do occur under drug use.
* Effective treatment should address all of the patient's needs.
* Treatment should be consistent.
* The combination of medication and behavioral therapy (counseling) works efficiently.
* Treatment plans must be reviewed often and modified to fit the patient's changing needs.
* Treatment should take all possible mental disorders into account.
* Drug use must be monitored and prohibited continuously throughout the treatment in order to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/treatment-approaches-drug-addiction|title=Treatment Approaches for Drug Addiction|last=Abuse|first=National Institute on Drug|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==
People of any age, sex or economic status can become addicted to a drug. However, certain factors can affect the likelihood and speed of developing an addiction:
* Family history: If a person has a closely related family member that consumes drugs, it is more likely for them to also consume drugs.
* Being male: In cases of both drug uses and prostitution, the ratio of male addicts is much higher than female.
* Having another mental health disorder: Other mental health disorders such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder can increase the probability of drug use of a person.
* Peer pressure: Especially for teenagers and young adults, peer pressure is a prominent factor that may cause drug use.
* Anxiety, depression and loneliness: These feelings may increase the likelihood of drug use and prostitution. Many drug users presume that using drugs is a good method to release their pressure and get rid of depressing feelings, while the consequence is actually completely the opposite, which is making their feelings even worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/drug-addiction/basics/risk-factors/con-20020970|title=Drug addiction Risk factors - Mayo Clinic|website=www.mayoclinic.org|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|UN Flag|The Earth Summit was a [[United Nations|UN]] event]] 

The '''United Nations Conference on Environment and Development''' ('''UNCED'''), also known as the '''Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit''', the '''Rio Summit''', the '''Rio Conference''', and the '''Earth Summit''' (Portuguese: ECO92), was a major [[United Nations]] [[diplomatic conference|conference]] held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] from 3 to 14 June 1992.

More than 100 heads of states met in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil...Earth Summit was created as a response for [[Member States]] to cooperate together internationally on development issues after the [[Cold War]]. Due to conflict relating to [[sustainability]] being too big for individual member states to handle, Earth Summit was held as a platform for other Member States to collaborate. Since the creation, many others in the field of sustainability show a similar development to the issues discussed in these conferences, including [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/geninfo/bp/intro.html|title=World Conferences Introduction|author=|date=|website=www.un.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310135935/http://www.un.org/geninfo/bp/intro.html|archivedate=10 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;


In 2012, the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] was also held in Rio, and is also commonly called Rio+20 or Rio Earth Summit 2012. It was held from 13 to 22 June.



The issues addressed included:   
* systematic scrutiny of patterns of production — particularly the production of toxic components, such as [[Tetraethyllead|lead]] in [[gasoline]], or poisonous waste including radioactive chemicals 
* alternative sources of energy to replace the use of [[fossil fuel]]s which delegates linked to global [[climate change]]
* new reliance on [[public transportation]] systems in order to reduce vehicle emissions, congestion in cities and the health problems caused by polluted air and smoke
* the growing usage and limited supply of [[water]]

An important achievement of the summit was an agreement on the [[Climate Change Convention]] which in turn led to the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and the [[Paris Agreement]]. Another agreement was to "not to carry out any activities on the lands of [[indigenous peoples]] that would cause [[environmental degradation]] or that would be culturally inappropriate".

The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] was opened for signature at the Earth Summit, and made a start towards redefinition of measures that did not inherently encourage destruction of natural [[ecoregion]]s and so-called [[uneconomic growth]].

Although President [[George H.W. Bush]] signed the Earth Summit’s Convention on Climate, his EPA Administrator William K. Reilly acknowledges that U.S. goals at the conference were difficult to negotiate and the agency’s international results were mixed, including the U.S. failure to sign the proposed Convention on Biological Diversity. &lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: EPA Administrator William K. Reilly discusses his efforts at the Rio conference, including successes and failures. Reflections on US Environmental Policy: An Interview with William K.

Twelve cities were also honoured by the Local Government Honours Award for innovative local environmental programs. These included [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] in [[Canada]] for its ambitious program to rehabilitate environmental damage from the local [[mining]] industry, [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] in the [[United States]] for its [[green building]] strategy, and [[Kitakyūshū]] in [[Japan]] for incorporating an international education and training component into its municipal [[pollution control]] program.

The Earth Summit resulted in the following documents: 
* ''[[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=United Nations Conference on Environment and Development |url=http://habitat.igc.org/agenda21/rio-dec.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402153036/http://habitat.igc.org/agenda21/rio-dec.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 April 2003 |title=Rio Declaration on Environment and Development |publisher=Habitat.igc.org |date= |accessdate=4 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Forest Principles]]''

Moreover, important legally binding agreements ([[Rio Convention]]) were opened for signature:
* ''[[Convention on Biological Diversity]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbd.int |title=CBD Home |publisher=Cbd.int |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110223150753/http://www.cbd.int |archivedate=23 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC)''
* ''[[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]]''

In order to ensure compliance to the agreements at Rio (particularly the ''[[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]]'' and ''[[Agenda 21]]''), delegates to the Earth Summit established the ''[[Commission on Sustainable Development]]'' (CSD). In 2013, the CSD was replaced by the ''[[High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development]]'' that meets every year as part of the ECOSOC meetings, and every fourth year as part of the General Assembly meetings.

Critics point out that many of the agreements made in Rio have not been realized regarding such fundamental issues as fighting [[poverty]] and cleaning up the [[Natural environment|environment]].

[[Green Cross International]] was founded to build upon the work of the Summit.

The first edition of Water Quality Assessments, published by WHO/[[Chapman &amp; Hall]], was launched at the Rio Global Forum.

'''''Eisengarn''''', meaning "iron yarn" in English, is a light-reflecting, strong, waxed-cotton thread. It was invented and manufactured in Germany in the mid-19th century, but is now most well known for its use in cloth woven for the tubular-steel chairs designed by [[Marcel Breuer]] while he was a teacher at the [[Bauhaus]] design school.

The yarn is also known as '''''Glanzgarn''''' ('gloss' or 'glazed' yarn). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeitlos-berlin.de/aktuelles/eisengarn-eine-material-geschichte zeitlos-berlin.de], ''Eisengarn – Eine Material Geschichte''. Retrieved 27 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Manufacture ==
Despite the name, there is no iron in ''eisengarn''. The name refers to its strength and metallic shine. It is made by soaking cotton threads in a starch and [[paraffin wax]] solution. The threads are dried and then stretched and polished by steel rollers and brushes. The end result of the process is a lustrous, tear-resistant yarn which is extremely hardwearing.&lt;ref name=history&gt; [http://www.wuppertal.ihk24.de/servicemarken/branchen_neu/industrie/industrie_im_bs/902782/Textilstandort_Wuppertal.html ''Industriegeschichte aus dem Bergischen land''].

== History ==
[[File:Barmen (1870).jpg|thumb|Barmen (1870)]]
[[File:Netz.jpg|thumb|150px|Eisengarn string bag]]
The ''eisengarn'' manufacturing process was invented in the mid-19th century in a factory in [[Barmen]], now part of the city of [[Wuppertal]], east of the river [[Rhine]].&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; 

It was used as a sewing thread and for making lace, shoe laces, hat strings, ribbons, lining materials and in the cable industry.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

The manufacture of the yarn gave a considerable boost to the textile industry of Barmen and the surrounding region. By 1875, the Wuppertal company Barthels &amp; Feldhoff employed more than 300 people in eisengarn production.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

In 1927 the weaver and textile designer [[Margaretha Reichardt]] (1907–1984), then a student at the Bauhaus design school, experimented and improved the quality of the thread and developed cloth and strapping material made from ''eisengarn'' for use on Marcel Breuer's tubular steel chairs, such as the [[Wassily Chair]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bauhaus100.de/en/past/people/students/margaretha-reichardt/ Bauhaus100.

[Kreis Weimarer Land/Angermuseum Erfurt]:[Erfurt], p19&lt;/ref&gt; 

Light-weight tubular steel seating was also used in aircraft seating in the 1930s and Reichardt's improved version of ''eisengarn'' was used as a covering for the seats.&lt;ref&gt;Stutterheim, Kerstin; Bolbrinker, Niels.

A more prosaic use for the strong eisengarn thread was, and still is, for making colourful [[String bag|string shopping bags]], which were popular in the former [[East Germany]], and are now an [[Ostalgie]] item.&lt;ref name=Tagesspiegel&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/geschichte/aus-der-mode-aus-dem-sinn/1501512.html Wiebrecht V., Skuppin, R.

The '''Exploratorium''' is a museum in [[San Francisco]] that allows visitors to explore the world through science, art, and human perception. Its mission is to create inquiry-based experiences that transform learning worldwide. It has been described by the ''New York Times'' as the most important science museum to have opened since the mid-20th century, an achievement attributed to "the nature of its exhibits, its wide-ranging influence and its sophisticated teacher training program".&lt;ref name=Lawlessness&gt;{{cite news|last=Rothstein|first=Edward|title=An Emphasis on Newton’s Laws (and a Little Lawlessness)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/arts/design/the-new-exploratorium-opens-in-san-francisco.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characterized as "a mad scientist's penny arcade, a scientific funhouse, and an experimental laboratory all rolled into one",&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Allison|title=A First Look at the New Exploratorium|url=http://www.7x7.com/arts-culture/first-look-new-exploratorium|work=7x7 Magazine|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the participatory nature of its exhibits and its self-identification as a center for informal learning has led to it being cited as the prototype for participatory museums around the world.&lt;ref name=Thrill&gt;{{cite news|last=Rothstein|first=Edward|title=The Thrill of Science, Tamed by Agendas|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium was founded by physicist and educator [[Frank Oppenheimer]] and opened in 1969 at the [[Palace of Fine Arts]], its home until January 2, 2013. On April 17, 2013, the Exploratorium reopened at Piers 15 and 17 on San Francisco's [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]]. The historic interior and exterior of Pier 15 was renovated extensively prior to the move, and is divided into several galleries mainly separated by content, including the physics of seeing and listening (Light and Sound), Human Behavior, Living Systems, Tinkering (including electricity and magnetism), the Outdoor Gallery, and the Bay Observatory Gallery, which focuses on local environment, weather, and landscape.

Since the museum's founding, over 1,000 participatory exhibits have been created, approximately 600 of which are on the floor at any given time. The exhibit-building workshop space is contained within the museum and is open to view. In addition to the public exhibition space, the Exploratorium has been engaged in the professional development of teachers, science education reform, and the promotion of museums as informal education centers since its founding. Since Oppenheimer's death in 1985, the Exploratorium has expanded into other domains, including its 50,000-page website and two iPad apps on sound and color. It has also inspired an international network of participatory museums working to engage the public with general science education.&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|title=San Francisco Exploratorium to Show New Face in a New Place|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/science/exploratorium-to-reopen-on-san-francisco-bay-in-2013.html|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Exploratorium building is also working to showcase environmental sustainability efforts as part of its goal to become the largest net-zero museum in the country.&lt;ref name=SFGateNetZero&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlman|first=David|title=Exploratorium sets 'Net-Zero' energy goal|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Exploratorium-sets-Net-Zero-energy-goal-4422432.php?t=6a884541ce|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium offers visitors a variety of ways—including exhibits, webcasts, websites and events—to explore and understand the world around them. In 2011, the Exploratorium received the [[National Science Board]] 2011 Public Service Science Award for its contributions to public understanding of science and engineering.&lt;ref name='NSF2011'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=119077&amp;org=NSB&amp;from=news | title = San Francisco-based Exploratorium to Receive National Science Board's 2011 Public Service Award | accessdate = 2012-06-20 | date = April 4, 2011 | publisher = [[National Science Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Inside exploratorium.jpg|thumb|left|Exploratorium's main floor, in its original [[Palace of Fine Arts]] location (2009)]]

===Founding and early years===
[[File:Frank Oppenheimer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Frank Oppenheimer]], founder of the Exploratorium]]
The Exploratorium is the brainchild of [[Frank Oppenheimer]], an experimental physicist and university professor. Oppenheimer, who worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] with his brother [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], was diverted from an academic career when he was forced to resign from his position at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1949 as a result of an inquiry by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. He was blacklisted from academic positions across the country, and withdrew with his family to run a Colorado [[cattle ranch]] for almost a decade.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|104–115}}

Oppenheimer also began lending a hand with science projects of local high school students, eventually becoming the sole science teacher at the high school in [[Pagosa Springs, Colorado]]. The field trips and experiments he did with his high school students would become a blueprint for the hands-on methods of teaching and learning he would later bring to the Exploratorium.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|115–121}}
 
When Oppenheimer was invited to join the University of Colorado's physics department in 1959, he found himself less interested in traditional laboratory research and much more interested in exploring methods of provoking curiosity and inquiry.  He received a grant from the National Science Foundation, which he used to build models of nearly a hundred science experiments.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|136–137}} This "Library of Experiments" would become the core of the Exploratorium exhibit collection, and was the forerunner of the ''Exploratorium Cookbook'', a manual explaining how to build these basic science exhibits.&lt;ref name=Cookbook&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploratorium Cookbook I: A Construction Manual for Exploratorium Exhibits |url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/pubs.net/cookbook1.html |work=Exploratorium Publications |publisher=The Exploratorium |accessdate=2014-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423045619/http://www.exploratorium.edu/pubs.net/cookbook1.html |archivedate=April 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Convinced of the need for public museums to supplement science curricula at all levels, he toured Europe and studied museums on a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1965. Three European museums, encountered during that year, served as important influences on the founding of the Exploratorium: the [[Palais de la Découverte]], which displayed models to teach scientific concepts and employed students as demonstrators, a practice that directly inspired the Exploratorium's much-lauded High School Explainer Program; the [[South Kensington Museum]] of Science and Art, which Oppenheimer and his wife visited frequently; and the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich, the world's largest science museum, which had a number of interactive displays that impressed the Oppenheimers.

Back in the United States, Oppenheimer was invited to do the initial planning for a new branch of the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], but he turned it down to work on what he called his "San Francisco project". In 1967, the Oppenheimers came to [[San Francisco]] with a view towards opening an independent museum of their own. Oppenheimer sought funding and support for the endeavor using a grassroots approach, bringing a written proposal and some handmade exhibits with him as he visited scientists, businesses, city and school officials, relatives, and friends. Many prominent scientists and cultural figures endorsed the project, and the offers of support in conjunction with a $50,000 grant from the [[San Francisco Foundation]] made the museum realizable.

In late August 1969, the Exploratorium opened with little fanfare at the Palace of Fine Arts. Oppenheimer "simply opened the doors".&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|152}} Although the building needed many improvements, Oppenheimer couldn't afford to make the changes, and decided to allow the public to come and watch exhibits being built and changes being made as part of the participatory ethos of the institution.&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite book|title=Something Incredibly Wonderful Happens - Frank Oppenheimer and the World He Made Up|last=[[K.C.

Instead, Oppenheimer insisted that the workshop be placed without a wall, right next to the main entrance so that visitors could experience "the way a shop smells when you burn the wood in a saw, or smell the oil from a lathe".&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|156}} Above the workshop was a sign, made by the wife of [[George Gamow]], a physicist, educator, and friend of Oppenheimer who had died just a year before the opening of the Exploratorium.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|152,157}} The inscription said "Here Is Being Created the Exploratorium a Community Museum Dedicated to Awareness".&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|157}}  (Today, a copy of this motto is inscribed above the main entrance to the new Exploratorium at Pier 15.)

Oppenheimer served as the museum’s director until his death in 1985. Dr. Robert L. White served as director from 1987 to 1990. Dr. [[Goéry Delacôte]] served as executive director from 1991 until 2005.&lt;ref name="businessweek"&gt;{{cite web|title=Goéry Delacôte: Executive Profile &amp; Biography|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=2309151&amp;privcapId=2221131|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Dennis Bartels served as executive director of the Exploratorium from 2006 to 2016. In June 2016, the Exploratorium welcomed its newest director, Chris Flink.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/chris-flink-selected-as-new-exploratorium-executive-director Chris Flink Selected as New Exploratorium Executive Director | Exploratorium&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The museum has expanded greatly since the 1980s, increasing outreach, expanding programs for educators, creating an expanded Web presence, and forming museum partnerships around the world.

===Move to Piers 15 and 17===
The Exploratorium relocated from the Palace of Fine Arts to Piers 15 and 17, located between the [[San Francisco Ferry Building]] and [[Pier 39]] along the San Francisco Embarcadero, in April 2013. The Piers location was identified by Goéry Delacôte and then-board chairman Van Kasper as a potential space for relocation in 2004.&lt;ref name="Build"&gt;{{cite book | last = Woolsey | first = Kristina| title = Build: The Making of a Museum | publisher = Exploratorium | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-943451-66-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}  In 2005, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution exempting the museum’s 66-year lease of the piers from San Francisco’s competitive bidding process due to its unique nature as a cultural and educational institution.&lt;ref name=Sadiq&gt;{{cite web|last=Sadiq|first=Sheraz|title=Exploratorium Unveils Plans for New Home|url=http://science.kqed.org/quest/2010/10/19/exploratorium-unveils-plans-for-new-home/|work=QUEST|publisher=KQED|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groundbreaking for the project, which required substantial construction and renovation, occurred on October 19, 2010. The Exploratorium holds a 66-year lease on the piers with the Port of San Francisco. Exhibits are currently only viewable at the  Pier 15 campus; Pier 17 houses some staff, with the option for future expansion.&lt;ref name=Perlman2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlman|first=David|title=Exploratorium in S.F. beginning work on new home|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Exploratorium-in-S-F-beginning-work-on-new-home-3170176.php|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piers 15 and 17 are historic piers, built in 1931 and 1912 respectively.&lt;ref name="Under"&gt;{{cite book | last = Woolsey | first = Kristina| title = Under: The World Below the Museum | publisher = Exploratorium | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-943451-67-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}}    In 1954, the area between the piers was infilled and paved over. This infill was removed as part of the construction phase, restoring the space between the piers to public plazas, a pedestrian bridge, and open water.

==Architecture and design==

===Renovation of Piers 15 and 17===
[[File:Rust wedge.jpg|thumb|upright|Outdoors "Rust Wedge" display shows the enormous expansive force of [[rust|rusting iron]]]]
The Exploratorium campus comprises  {{convert|330,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of indoor and outdoor exhibit space, and includes {{convert|1.5|acre|ha}} of freely accessible public space. The exhibits are housed in and around Pier 15, which extends over {{convert|800|ft|m|abbr=on}} over the Bay.&lt;ref name=MovingScience&gt;{{cite news|last=Beato|first=Greg|title=The Science of Moving Science Across Town|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/arts/artsspecial/how-the-exploratorium-in-san-francisco-moved-across-town.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium at Pier 15 was designed by architecture firm [[EHDD]].&lt;ref name=Breakthrough&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee |first=Lydia |title=Breakthrough at San Francisco's Exploratorium |url=http://archpaper.com/news/articles.asp?id=4930 |accessdate=12 June 2013 |newspaper=The Architect's Newspaper |date=October 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517153030/http://archpaper.com/news/articles.asp?id=4930 |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nibbi Brothers served as the General Contractor,&lt;ref name="Exploratorium, Designed by EHDD"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gerfen|first=Katie|title=Exploratorium, Designed by EHDD|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/design/buildings/exploratorium-designed-by-ehdd_o|accessdate=4 August 2015|newspaper=THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS|date=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[AGA (Architectural Glass and Aluminum)]] as the Glazing Contractor. The piers had been neglected for decades leading up to the Exploratorium’s move, and extensive renovation and repair was required.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|11}} Nearly two thirds of the [[piling]]s under Pier 15 were repaired, including almost every piling needed to provide structural integrity, and new pilings were sunk.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|24}} The removal of the parking lot between the piers was done slowly over the two years of construction, and the debris from the removal was captured and recycled.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|67}} Several pilings were left in the water between the piers, both for aesthetic reasons and to support future exhibits.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|47}}

An effort was made in the construction of the new location to preserve the historic elements of Pier 15.  The Bay Observatory was the only new structure added to the site. The east end of the pier was cleaned of [[lead paint]], revealing historic lettering underneath; designers chose to preserve the lettering rather than paint it over.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|67}} As a result, the traces of the shipping lines that originally frequented the pier can still be seen. Some of the preservation efforts presented challenges in design, however; historic windows created energy losses that had to be offset elsewhere, and the historic interior trusswork was mainly restored rather than removed, meaning that the upper-level staff offices had to be built around them.&lt;ref name="Sustain"&gt;{{cite book | last = Woolsey | first = Kristina| title = Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit | publisher = Exploratorium | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-943451-68-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

Other challenges to the design of the facilities were presented by the museum’s sustainability initiatives. The use of natural light whenever possible challenged exhibit designers relying on carefully controlled light levels; this was solved by using curtains and glare-reducing paint colors.&lt;ref name="Sustain" /&gt;{{rp|32}} Other conflicts between construction and energy use included the glass in the Observatory, which would have presented a problem in cooling the building on warm days. This was overcome by adding fritted glass to the windows in thin horizontal lines through the panes to decrease the transparency without affecting the views.&lt;ref name="Sustain" /&gt;{{rp|85}} The fritting also makes the reflective surfaces of the Bay Observatory safe for birds.&lt;ref name=TakingFlight&gt;{{cite news|last=Schreiber |first=Dan |title=Bird-safe building standards taking flight in San Francisco |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2011/06/bird-safe-building-standards-taking-flight |accessdate=May 23, 2013 |newspaper=The San Francisco Examiner |date=June 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908200100/http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2011/06/bird-safe-building-standards-taking-flight |archivedate=September 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pier 15 incorporated two seismic joints as part of its [[seismic retrofit]], one separating the Bay Observatory from the Pier 15 shed and the other separating the entire pier from the land. This second joint ensures that the entire pier will move independently from the land mass in the event of an earthquake, significantly reducing the potential [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsional]] stress.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|83}} The café at the west end of the Exploratorium is named the Seismic Joint in honor of the joint, which cuts through the area of the building where the café is situated.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|80}}

The aesthetic of the project was defined as "industrial naval chic" in keeping with the pier’s history.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|63}}

===Restaurant===
[[File:Seaglass Restaurant at the Exploratorium.jpeg|thumb|The design scheme for the Exploratorium's Seaglass Restaurant was inspired by the exhibit ''Color of Water''.]]
The design aesthetic for both the Seismic Joint and Seaglass Restaurant was created by designer Olle Lundberg and based on the exhibit ''Color of Water''. The bar at Seaglass features a specially designed version of Exploratorium artist Shawn Lani’s exhibit ''Icy Bodies''.&lt;ref name=Feasters&gt;{{cite web|last=Meier-Johnson|first=Pat|title=Seaglass Restaurant at the Exploratorium: A Sense for the Feasters|url=http://connectedtraveler.com/index.php/travel-tech/science/307-san-francisco-exploratorium-has-a-sense-for-the-feast|work=The Connected Traveler|accessdate=12 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615204423/http://connectedtraveler.com/index.php/travel-tech/science/307-san-francisco-exploratorium-has-a-sense-for-the-feast|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LorettaKeller&gt;{{cite web|last=Pape|first=Allie|title=Loretta Keller's Exploratorium Duo to Open April 17|url=http://sf.eater.com/archives/2013/03/25/loretta_kellers_exploratorium_restaurants_to_open_april_17.php|work=SF Eater|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
The Exploratorium at Pier 15 has a net-zero energy goal as part of its overall sustainability efforts. Setting this net-zero goal means that, while in operation, The Exploratorium will produce more energy on-site than it will consume on an annual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawley|first1=Drury B.|last2=Torcellini|first2=Paul A., Ph.D., P.E.|title=Understanding Zero-Energy Buildings|journal=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.|date=September 2006|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum highlights its sustainability efforts in visible ways throughout the museum as part of a stated intention to lead by example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolsey|first1=Kristina|title=Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit|date=2012|publisher=The Exploratorium|isbn=978-0-943451-68-8|page=22|url=http://lmngroup.pikibox.com/pikibox.com/lmngroup/uploads/sustain.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TruongEcoFriendly&gt;{{cite web|last=Truong|first=Alice|title=Landmark museum to reopen as most energy-efficient institute on Earth|url=https://news.yahoo.com/landmark-museum-to-reopen-as-most-eco-friendly-institute-on-earth-195905286.html|work=Yahoo!

The Exploratorium, in order to reach its net-zero energy goal, produces energy with a roof-mounted array of [[photovoltaics]].  There are 5,874 PV modules on the roof, totaling {{convert|78,712|sqft|m2}}, with a projected year-1 yield of 1.3 MW-AC/square foot (13.9 MW-AC/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), or a total year-1 yield of 2,113,715 kWh.&lt;ref name="Sustain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ehdd.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainability Fact Sheet: Environmentally Conscious Inside and Out|url=http://www.ehdd.com/sites/ehdd2/images/6275/Exploratorium%20Sustainability%20Project%20Sheet.pdf|website=EHDD Architecture|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any surplus energy generated is intended to be fed back into the utility grid, as the projected annual energy use for the building totals at 1,275,936 kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploratorium's Net-Zero Energy Goal for New Waterfront Home 2013|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/exploratoriums-net-zero-energy-goal-new-waterfront-home-2013|website=Exploratorium|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abellon&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abellon, P.E.|first1=Devin A.|title=Exploratorium's New Waterfront Home Features Innovative Radiant System Using SF Bay Water|url=http://uponor.media-resources-ordp.com/casestudies/exploratorium.shtml|website=Uponor, Inc.|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schematic diagram of bay water heating and cooling system at The Exploratorium, San Francisco.png|thumbnail|right|Diagram of bay water heating and cooling system at The Exploratorium]]
In addition to solar power, the museum makes use of an [[HVAC]] system that takes advantage of the relatively constant, moderate temperature of the bay water under the piers, which is {{convert|50|to|65|F|C}}, to heat and cool the building. The bay water is filtered and sterilized before it is brought into a {{convert|4,000|USgal|m3}} cistern below the pier, where it is held for use.  When needed, the bay water is moved to a titanium [[heat exchanger]], of which the building has two, where it is either used to heat or cool water that is cycled through a system of thermally activated radiant slabs.&lt;ref name="Exploring Every Possibility"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abellon|first1=Devin|title=Exploring Every Possibility|url=http://www.edcmag.com/articles/95153-the-exploratorium-at-pier-15|website=EDC: The Official Magazine for the LEED Professional|publisher=BNP Media|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are {{convert|27|mi|km}} of plastic tubing in the [[radiant heating]] system in the floor, creating 82 different heating and cooling zones with distinct control systems.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt; After the bay water passes through the heat exchangers, it is returned to the San Francisco Bay as allowed by a permit issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ORDER NO. R2-2010-0082|url=http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/sanfranciscobay/board_decisions/adopted_orders/2010/R2-2010-0082.pdf|website=California Environmental Protection Agency: State Water Resources Control Board|publisher=California Regional Water Quality Control Board: San Francisco Bay Region|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the energy savings are expected to come from using the bay water as a [[heat sink]] for the building’s cooling needs.  When the temperature of the bay water is below that of the chilled water return from the radiant pipes, which is the case for most of the year in the Bay Area’s temperate climate, the system works in waterside [[economizer]] mode.  In this mode, the cooling loads are met either entirely or partially through passive heat exchange between the colder bay water and the warmer return water, greatly reducing the building’s energy needs.&lt;ref name=Abellon /&gt;

The Exploratorium at Pier 15 has a separate system for its ventilation needs, pairing a [[dedicated outdoor air system]] (DOAS) with [[displacement ventilation]] distribution to bring outdoor air into the building.  By integrating radiant heating and cooling and displacement ventilation, the Exploratorium has greatly reduced the portion of its HVAC system that relies on forced air.  Reducing the size of a building’s forced air system has the associated benefits of both lower energy loads as well as reduced ductwork, both of which are cost-saving.&lt;ref name="Exploring Every Possibility"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Straube|first1=John|title=The Perfect HVAC|url=http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/insights/bsi-022-the-perfect-hvac|website=Building Science Corporation|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium has multiple features designed to reduce its water consumption.  Two large cisterns under the structural beams connecting the southeast pilings capture up to {{convert|338,000|USgal|m3}} of rainwater and fog runoff for reuse in the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolsey|first1=Kristina|title=Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit|date=2012|publisher=The Exploratorium|isbn=978-0-943451-68-8|page=17|url=http://lmngroup.pikibox.com/pikibox.com/lmngroup/uploads/sustain.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plumbing is designed for water conservation, with [[waterless urinal]]s and [[dual-flush toilet]]s projected to save an annual million gallons of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolsey|first1=Kristina|title=Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit|publisher=The Exploratorium|isbn=978-0-943451-68-8|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the bay water heating and cooling system is estimated to save two million gallons of potable water a year by eliminating the need for traditional evaporative cooling towers.&lt;ref name="ehdd.com"/&gt;

The Exploratorium at Pier 15 also makes use of natural light in the effort to reduce energy loads.  The existing building had many clerestory windows and an overhead skylight that runs the length of the interior space.  In compliance with historic preservation requirements, the building’s façade was left mostly unchanged, allowing for much of the interior space to benefit from the existing architecture’s ample daylight.  The retrofit did include the addition of high performance glazing to the existing windows.&lt;ref name=Sustain /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerfen|first1=Katie|title=Exploratorium|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/cultural-projects/exploratorium.aspx|website=Architect Magazine: The Magazine of the American Institute of Architects|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Young|first1=Mignon|title=Sustainability Around The Bay|url=http://www.gabreport.com/2014/05/sustainability-around-the-bay|website=GAB: Green Architecture and Building Report|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the Exploratorium was awarded [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum certification.&lt;ref name="USGBC Scorecard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploratorium at Piers 15/17 LEED Scorecard|url=http://www.usgbc.org/projects/exploratorium-piers-1517|website=US Green Building Council|publisher=US Green Building Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', "After a two-year post-opening shakedown period of monitoring and adjusting the systems, the Exploratorium hopes to become the largest net-zero-energy-use museum in the United States and possibly the world."&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Christopher|title=A San Francisco Museum, Reborn on the Bay|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/travel/a-san-francisco-museum-reborn-on-the-bay.html|accessdate=2013-08-07|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploratorium is also turning its commitment to sustainability into a learning experience by showcasing elements of the building’s green design on site.&lt;ref name=Sustain /&gt;

==Layout==
The new site contains over 600 exhibits, 25% of which were developed specifically for the Pier 15 site. With the exception of some art installations, all exhibits are developed and made onsite.&lt;ref name=OpensApril10&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlman|first=David|title=Exploratorium opens April 10 at Pier 15|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/science/article/Exploratorium-opens-April-10-at-Pier-15-4430723.php|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indoor and outdoor spaces are divided into six galleries, each highlighting a specific content group. Many exhibits are mobile, however, and move among different galleries; similarly, not all exhibits fall into distinct categories.

Exhibits cover a range of subject areas, including [[human perception]] (such as vision, hearing, learning and cognition), the life sciences, physical phenomena (such as light, motion, electricity, waves and resonance, and magnetism), local environment (water, wind, fog, rain, sun, and other elements, as well as cityscape, landscape, and the flora and fauna of the Bay) and human behavior (such as cooperation, competition, and sharing).&lt;ref name=MuseumGalleries&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum Galleries|url=http://exploratorium.edu/visit/galleries/|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Osher West Gallery: Human Behavior===
[[File:Blowing Smoke.jpg|thumb|right|Visitors collaborate to make a [[smoke ring]] at the Exploratorium's previous location at the Palace of Fine Arts]]
The West Gallery focuses on human behavior.  Its signage and exhibits encourage visitors to play with perception; investigate memory, emotion, and judgment; and experiment with how people cooperate, compete, and share. It holds exhibits such as ''Poker Face'' (partners try to assess when someone is bluffing), ''Trust Fountain'' (an experimental exhibit from the museum’s [[National Science Foundation]]-funded Science of Sharing project, this two-person drinking fountain is based on the [[Prisoner’s dilemma]], a classic scenario centering on negotiation and trust),&lt;ref name=GalleriesExhibits&gt;{{cite web|title=Galleries and Exhibit Highlights|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/galleries-and-exhibit-highlights|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Tactile Dome'', a pitch-black environment visitors explore by touch, which was originally designed by [[August Coppola]].&lt;ref name=Coppola&gt;{{cite web|last=Barmann|first=Jay|title=August Coppola, Brother of Francis, Creator of Tactile Dome, Dies at 75|url=http://sfist.com/2009/11/04/august_coppola_brother_of_francis_c.php|work=SFist.com|accessdate=12 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813044417/http://sfist.com/2009/11/04/august_coppola_brother_of_francis_c.php|archivedate=13 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Gallery also included the temporary exhibition ''The Changing Face of What is Normal: Mental Health'', which showcased the personal artifacts of patients from the now-decommissioned Willard Psychiatric Center,&lt;ref name=Lawlessness /&gt; which was on view through April 2014.

The West Gallery also houses the Kanbar Forum, a cabaret-style theater that will host music events, science lectures, and other programs when it opens in summer 2013.&lt;ref name=sparkling&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Heather|title=San Francisco's Exploratorium opens in sparkling new home|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/16/tech/innovation/new-exploratorium|work=CNN|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Gallery: Tinkering===
The South Gallery is a workshop area where visitors can engage in learning through [[maker movement|hands-on making]], located directly across from the Exploratorium's own internal exhibit workshop, which is also open to their view. Oppenheimer wanted visitors to be able to “smell the oil”, and insisted that the usually hidden exhibit-building activities be on display as an exhibit in its own right.&lt;ref name=shrine&gt;{{cite web|last=Truong|first=Alice|title=Exploratorium Reborn: Inside San Francisco's New Innovation Shrine|url=https://gizmodo.com/5994274/exploratorium-reborn-inside-san-franciscos-new-shrine-to-innovation|work=Gizmodo|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibits in the South Gallery highlight a [[DIY]] aesthetic, and include ''Animation Stations'' where visitors can make their own [[stop motion|stop-motion films]].

Artworks on display include the ''Tinkerer’s Clock'' (a 22-foot-high clock constructed by artist [[Tim Hunkin]], with figurines in his noted cartoon style that can be manipulated by visitors and unfold into a clockface on the hour); and ''Rolling Through The Bay'' (a sculpture made by artist Scott Weaver over the course of 37 years, utilizing over 100,000 toothpicks and depicting many of the Bay Area’s iconic landmarks, through which a ping-pong ball can roll on one of several different "tours").&lt;ref name=rolling&gt;{{cite web|last=Koh|first=Barbara|title=At the Exploratorium – Scott Weaver’s Amazing Toothpick Art|url=http://sanfrancisco.about.com/od/sfevents/p/At-The-Exploratorium-Scott-Weavers-Amazing-Toothpick-Art.htm|work=About.com|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bechtel Central Gallery: Seeing and Listening===
[[File:Giant Mirror at the Exploratorium.jpeg|thumb|A visitor investigates the reflective properties of the Giant Mirror in the Central Gallery of the Exploratorium at Pier 15.]]
The Bechtel Central gallery houses many of the "classic" Exploratorium exhibits, including many of those that have been on display since the very earliest years of the museum.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt; It includes a mix of new and old exhibits that investigate physics and the perception of light, color, and sound, such as ''Sound Bite'' (a demonstration of hearing with the jawbone instead of the ears) and ''Bright Black'' (a trick of perception convinces viewers that an object is white when it is almost entirely black).

===East Gallery: Living Systems===
The East Gallery houses a much-expanded selection of life sciences exhibits. Many exhibits relate directly to the immediate local environment, such as the ''Glass Settling Plate'' (barnacles and other creatures are grown on a plate in the Bay, then put live under a mobile microscope to be observed from both above and below) and the ''Algae Chandelier'' (visitors can pump air to nourish overhead tanks of colorful phytoplankton). Other exhibits explore different biological systems and processes, such as the imaging station with mouse stem cells, the live cow’s eye dissections, and the ''Live Chicken Embryo'' (one of the oldest of the Living Systems exhibits, showing live chicken embryos at different stages of development).&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenblatt|first=Seth|title=San Francisco Exploratorium shows off its huge new digs|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57579443-1/san-francisco-exploratorium-shows-off-its-huge-new-digs/|work=CNET|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery===
The Bay Observatory building is the only new building constructed on the Exploratorium’s campus. It holds the Seaglass restaurant on its lower level and exhibits on the upper level relating to the waterfront and the cityscape. The gallery focuses on what visitors can see in real time, including the movement of clouds and tides, the changing waterfront, the movement of ships, and interpretation of oceanographic data. The Observatory has glass walls on all four sides to facilitate observation. Many of the exhibits were developed specifically for the location, such as ''Oculus'' (a circular opening in the ceiling that allows the entire gallery to be used as a timepiece, tracking seasons, solstices, and the sun’s movement), ''Visualizing the Bay'' (a 3-D topographic map of the Bay Area that allows visitors to see real data mapped over the landscape, such as the movement of fog and the salinity of the Bay over the course of days or years), and the ''Map Table'' (an assortment of historic and contemporary maps and atlases displaying different views and perspectives on the landscape).&lt;ref name=eyes&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawkes|first=Alison|title=The Exploratorium’s new eyes on the bay|url=http://baynature.org/2013/04/18/the-exploratoriums-new-eyes-on-the-bay/|work=Bay Nature Magazine|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bay Observatory also houses the Wired Pier project, which consists of more than a dozen sensors on and around the Bay Observatory that stream real-time data about the surrounding environment, such as quality of air and bay water, weather, tides and pollution, and compile it into interactive visualizations.&lt;ref name=Plutchak&gt;{{cite web|last=Plutchak|first=Rochelle|title=NOAA Science Has  Home at the New Exploratorium|url=http://research.noaa.gov/InDepth/Features/CurrentFeature/TabId/728/ArtMID/1884/ArticleID/10044/NOAA-Science-Has-a-Home-at-the-New-Exploratorium.aspx|work=National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Website|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdoor Gallery===
[[File:Fog Bridge at the Exploratorium.jpeg|thumb|Mist from Fujiko Nakaya’s Fog Bridge drifts over the water between Piers 15 and 17 at the Exploratorium.]]
The Outdoor Gallery comprises the north, south, and east aprons of Pier 15, and extends through both ticketed and unticketed space. Focus is on direct interaction with the Bay environment, which can be seen in exhibits such as ''Color of Water'' (an installation of 32 distinct [[Textile sample|color swatches]] suspended below the rail surrounding the pier so that visitors can investigate the changing colors of the Bay’s water). Another notable exhibit is ''Remote Rains'', which allows visitors to choose a past rainstorm as profiled by the Hydrometeorology Testbed, which is then recreated by a rain machine that duplicates the frequency, size, and velocity of the raindrops, giving a tangible experience of [[NOAA]] research data on storms.&lt;ref name=Plutchak /&gt;&lt;ref name=huffpo&gt;{{cite news|title=SF Exploratorium set to open in new $300M digs|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130410/us-travel-san-francisco-new-exploratorium/|work=Huffington Post|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the publicly accessible bridge connecting Piers 15 and 17, artist [[Fujiko Nakaya]] created an installation called ''Fog Bridge #72494'' that creates bursts of fog for six minutes every half-hour as the first in a series of large-scale temporary installations called ''Over the Water''.&lt;ref name=overthewater&gt;{{cite web|title=Over the Water|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/arts/over-the-water|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Fog Bridge'' is {{convert|150|ft|m}} long and makes use of 800 nozzles to create the fog, which Nakaya hopes will inspire visitors to pay attention to the nature of one of San Francisco’s best-known weather patterns.  Although originally slated to be temporary, it is now on permanent display. A desalination system, located in Pier 17, conditions bay water for use in the artwork. &lt;ref name=Aleta&gt;{{cite web|last=Aleta|first=George|title=An Artist Creates Artificial Fog in San Francisco|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/artscience/2013/04/an-artist-creates-artificial-fog-in-san-francisco|work=Smithsonian Magazine Blog|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miranda" /&gt;

===Public space===
The Exploratorium campus includes {{convert|1.5|acre|ha}} of publicly accessible open space. This includes the plaza facing on the Embarcadero, the connector bridge between Piers 15 and 17 where ''Fog Bridge # 72494'' is installed, the south apron of Pier 17, and the east and south aprons of Pier 15. This public space overlaps with the Outdoor Gallery, and includes some notable exhibits, such as the ''Aeolian Harp'' (an expanded version of the original installation by Doug Hollis on the roof of the Exploratorium at the Palace of Fine Arts, first created in collaboration with Frank Oppenheimer in 1976)&lt;ref name=aeolian&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeolian Harp|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/outdoor-gallery/aeolian-harp|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ''Bay Windows'' (visitors spin disks filled with samples of Bay mud, sand, and gravel gathered from five distinct regions of the Bay itself).&lt;ref name=baywindows&gt;{{cite web|title=Bay Windows|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/outdoor-gallery/bay-windows|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restaurant===
The lower level of the Bay Observatory Building houses the Seaglass Restaurant, which, like the Seismic Joint Cafe, is open to unticketed members of the public. Both the Seismic Joint and Seaglass are run by Loretta Keller, chef-owner at Coco500, in partnership with Bon Appetit Management Company.

==Educational programs==
The Exploratorium seeks to bring hands-on inquiry to education, including training teachers in the teaching of science.&lt;ref&gt;

===Teacher Institute===
[[File:Exploratorium teachers.jpg|thumb|right|Teachers from the Exploratorium's Teacher Institute examine the "String Thing" they built]]
The Teacher Institute, founded in 1984, is an Exploratorium-based professional development program geared towards middle and high school science teachers. In addition to providing workshops at the museum that teach hands-on and inquiry-based teaching methods, it provides coaches and support for novice teachers. Studies have shown that while 30 to 50 percent of new teachers leave the profession within five years, the retention rate for teachers who go through the Teacher Institute is 85 to 90 percent.&lt;ref name=Olney&gt;{{cite news|last=Olney|first=Jennifer|title=Teachers participate in intense training program|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/focus_on_solutions&amp;id=8775413|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=KGO-TV|date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Teacher Institute is also home to the [[Iron Science Teacher]], a national competition that celebrates innovation and creativity in science teaching, which originated at the Exploratorium in San Francisco. Parodying the cult Japanese TV program, ''[[Iron Chef]]'', this competition showcases science teachers as they devise classroom activities using a particular ingredient — an everyday item such as a plastic bag, milk carton, or nail. Contestants are currently or formerly part of the Exploratorium's Teacher Institute and compete before a live audience for the title of "Iron Science Teacher". Shows are also archived on the Exploratorium's website.&lt;ref name=IronScience&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrington|first=Theresa|title='Iron Science Teacher' competitors at Exploratorium use museum paper as secret ingredient in fun demos|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_20993010/iron-science-teacher-competitors-at-exploratorium-use-museum|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=The San Jose Mercury News|date=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two out of three teachers applying were being turned away due to space limitations, by the time the Exploratorium closed at its former location; following the move to the Piers, the Exploratorium has been expanding its professional development for teachers through the Teacher Institute.&lt;ref name=Olney /&gt; {{As of|2013}}, two [[MOOC]] courses were also being made available through MOOC provider [[Coursera]]. One course integrates engineering into middle and high school [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math|STEM]] classrooms, and the other integrates [[maker movement|making and tinkering activities]] into elementary and middle school classrooms.&lt;ref name=Coursera&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellis|first=Booker|title=Coursera Online Hub Offers Teachers Development|url=http://www.informationweek.com/education/online-learning/coursera-online-hub-offers-teachers-deve/240153995|work=InformationWeek|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=May 1, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615031051/http://www.informationweek.com/education/online-learning/coursera-online-hub-offers-teachers-deve/240153995|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informal learning programs===
The Exploratorium operates several programs centering on informal learning. The Institute for Inquiry (IFI) is a professional development program of the Exploratorium geared towards educators, scientists, administrators, and policymakers. The Institute is a recipient of National Science Foundation funding and designs programs, materials and tools to help leaders in the science education community further the role of inquiry in elementary science education and strengthen reform efforts. It consists of workshops and an online library of resources available to participants in the Institute.&lt;ref name=IFI&gt;{{Cite report |author=Inverness Research Associates |authorlink= |date=June 2001 |title=Report: The Exploratorium's Institute for Inquiry Four Cornerstone Claims|url=http://www.inverness-research.org/reports/2001-11-ExplorIFI-4CornerstnClaims/2001-11-Rpt-ExploratrmIFI_4CornerstnClaims-Execsum.PDF |publisher=Inverness Research |page=ii |docket= |accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute for Inquiry partnered with the [[Sonoma Valley Unified School District]] on a program combining science education with [[English Language Development]] (ELD). Data from the two-year pilot study showed that a professional development program designed to help teachers integrate ELD strategies into science lessons had a significant, measurable impact on the achievement of students in both ELD and in science.&lt;ref name=innovation&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Narrative: Integrating English Language Development and Science: A Professional Development Approach|url=http://www2.ed.gov/programs/innovation/2010/narratives/u396c100434.pdf|work=Investing in Innovation Fund Website|publisher=US Department of Education|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Informal Learning and Schools (CILS) is a collaboration between the Exploratorium, the [[University of California Santa Cruz]], and [[King's College London]]. CILS studies the intersection between museums and schools as centers of informal learning with the intention of understanding how informal science learning occurs and how informal educational centers such as the Exploratorium can contribute to science education reform.&lt;ref name=CILS&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Details: Center for Informal Learning and Schools|url=http://informalscience.org/projects/ic-000-000-001-775/Center_for_Informal_Learning_and_Schools|work=Informal Science|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tinkering Studio began in 2008 as an in-house program geared towards [[maker culture]] and a “think with your hands” approach. It is housed within the museum in a dedicated space in the South Gallery, where it runs free do-it-yourself activities for museum visitors; it also shares its work with a larger audience of educators in afterschool programs, schools, museums and other learning environments. It is being cited as a prototype for similar programs across the globe,&lt;ref name=tinkering&gt;{{cite news|last=Guthrie|first=Julian|title=Exploratorium's Tinkering Studio makes science fun|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Exploratorium-s-Tinkering-Studio-makes-science-fun-2295556.php|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including South Korea, Canada, India, and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=mideast&gt;{{cite news|last=Raker|first=Silva|title=Exploratorium expanding minds in Mideast|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/Exploratorium-expanding-minds-in-Mideast-4395559.php|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploratorium also operates as afterschool tinkering program in partnership with San Francisco chapters of the Boys and Girls Club. In 2012 the Exploratorium was awarded a grant to create the California Tinkering Network, in collaboration with the Community Science Workshops, Techbridge, the [[Discovery Science Center]], the California Afterschool Network, and the California STEM Learning Network. These organizations partner with over 20 local afterschool or summer programs to provide STEM-enriched activities for children in underserved communities. The initiative was designed to test an adaptable model for providing tinkering activities to promote learning and development in an afterschool setting.&lt;ref name=cwsnetwork&gt;{{Cite report |last1=Michalchik |first1=Vera|last2=Remold|first2=Julie|last3=Verdugo |first3=Renato|date=March 2013 |title=California Tinkering Afterschool Network Pilot Year Evaluation Report |url=http://cswnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/CA-Tinkering-Afterschool-Network-Evaluation-Report-FINAL.pdf |publisher=SRI International |page=1 |accessdate=17 June 2013}}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium also houses a number of other educational resources. These include the Learning Commons, a library and media resource center that houses a collection of print and digital science teaching resources for use by regional educators; a webcast studio, located in the Central Gallery, which produces 75 educational Webcasts from the museum and locations around the world annually, including a live webcast of the Mars [[Curiosity Rover]] launch and landing; and Lifelong Learning, which creates educational programming for children, teens, family groups, and adults. Lifelong Learning programs further the Exploratorium’s stated dedication to informal learning and the museum as teaching tool, and include day camps, workshops for families, the Homeschool Science series (in-house classes geared specifically towards homeschooled students), the Girl’s Science Institute (multi-day workshops geared towards girls 9-11), and excursions for adults. The Exploratorium has also published a number of books, and many of the 50,000 pages on its website are hands-on activity ideas or science experiments in the museums’ signature open-ended style.

===Educational outreach===
The Exploratorium operates several educational outreach programs. The Community Outreach Program works with community organizations to provide exhibit-based educational activities for underserved children and families in the local community.&lt;ref name=tecolote&gt;{{cite news|last=Leibrich|first=Ryan|title=New Exploratorium location opens its doors|url=http://eltecolote.org/content/new-exploratorium-location-opens-its-doors/2013/04/25/|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=El Tecolote|date=April 25, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615204600/http://eltecolote.org/content/new-exploratorium-location-opens-its-doors/2013/04/25/|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploratorium is also home to XTech, a science education program for underserved middle school students. Begun in 2006, XTech was primarily funded by a National Science Foundation grant and provided afterschool activities in science, engineering, and technology in partnership with two community-based organizations in the Bay Area. XTech serves over 100 students a year in addition to 10-15 youth facilitators.&lt;ref name=xtech&gt;{{Cite report|last1=Carroll |first1=Becky |last2=Castori |first2=Pam |last3=Smith |first3=Anita |date=September 2009 |title=The Exploratorium's XTech Program: Engaging STEM Experiences for Middle School Youth |url=http://informalscience.org/images/evaluation/2009-09_Rpt_XTECH-SummRpt-final-1019-2009.pdf |publisher=Inverness Research |page=1 |accessdate=17 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133042/http://informalscience.org/images/evaluation/2009-09_Rpt_XTECH-SummRpt-final-1019-2009.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explainers===
The Exploratorium Explainer program, which has been operating since the museum opened, hires and trains high school students and young educators each year. The program tripled its capacity, hiring 300 Explainers, following the relocation to Pier 15 in 2013.&lt;ref name=KTVU&gt;{{cite news|title=SF Exploratorium set to open in new $300 million waterfront facility |url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/local/sf-exploratorium-set-open-new-300-million-digs/nXHLk |accessdate=18 June 2013 |newspaper=KTVU |date=April 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411173430/http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/local/sf-exploratorium-set-open-new-300-million-digs/nXHLk/ |archivedate=April 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Explainers function essentially as docents. There are two types of Explainers: High School Explainers, who are teenagers, and Field Trip Explainers, who are college students and young educators. The program was conceived by Frank Oppenheimer in the early days of the museum. He wanted to provide a visitor experience that was a learning experience in a museum context&lt;ref name=Richardson&gt;{{Cite thesis|type=PhD |title=Explainers' development of science-learner identities through participation in a community of practice |url=http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=antioch1327711877 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615204432/http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=antioch1327711877 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 June 2013 |last=Richardson |first=Anne |year=2011 |publisher=Antioch University |accessdate=17 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and allowed for guesswork and the absence of "correct" answers. He felt young people would be more capable than adults at conveying the open-ended experience he was looking for. His plan with the Explainers was to "loosen up the whole feeling of learning." Oppenheimer also intended the program to allow students to experience learning outside the framework of their school systems. The Explainers come from a highly diverse array of socioeconomic backgrounds, and he hoped they would bring families and friends who would not otherwise be likely to visit a museum.&lt;ref name=Cole /&gt;{{rp|169–174}} Both the High School and Field Trip Explainers are paid positions.

The Explainer Program was inspired by the staff demonstrations Frank observed at the Palais de la Decouverte, although the facilitators at the Palais when Oppenheimer visited were either graduate students or practicing scientists. The success of the Exploratorium’s Explainer program led the Palais to eventually hire teenage explainers of their own.&lt;ref name=ASTC&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duensing|first=Sally|title=Exporting the Exploratorium:  Creating a "Culture of Learning"|journal=ASTC Dimensions|date=November–December 1999|url=http://www.astc.org/pubs/dimensions/1999/nov-dec/exporting.htm|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Explainers often cite their experiences at the Exploratorium as defining elements of their success,&lt;ref name=Hamlin&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamlin|first=Jesse|title=Learning From Teaching at the Exploratorium / Student guides' lessons went beyond science|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Learning-From-Teaching-at-the-Exploratorium-2914198.php|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=18 June 2013|date=August 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; including several notable tech CEOs.&lt;ref name=verisign&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Dan|title=Profile of VeriSign chairman, CEO|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=April 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Silver&gt;{{cite web|last=Silver|first=Linda|title=Backyard science today, an innovative workforce tomorrow|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/backyard-science-today-an-innovative-workforce-tomorrow|work=The National|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
[[File:Walter Kitundu.jpg|thumb|right|[[Walter Kitundu]] - Artist in Residence and MacArthur Fellow]]
Despite being generally thought of as a science museum, the Exploratorium has always incorporated both science and art. As early as 1966, Frank Oppenheimer presented a paper discussing the connections between art and science, and the role of a museum in appealing to both casual visitors and serious students of all ages.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|142}}

The formal artist in residence program was started in 1974,&lt;ref name=AIR&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist-in-Residence Program|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/arts/artist-residence|work=Exploratorium|publisher=The Exploratorium|accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but artworks such as Bob Miller’s ''Sun Painting'' were commissioned shortly after the museum was opened in 1969.&lt;ref name=BobMiller&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Miller|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/collaborations/oshers/bob-miller|work=Exploratorium|publisher=The Exploratorium|accessdate=2014-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the founding of the artist in residence program, over 250 artworks in various disciplines have been created.

Each year, the museum invites ten to twenty artists to participate in residencies ranging from two weeks to two years. Artists-in-residence work with staff and the visiting public to create original installations, exhibits, or performances. Artists are given a stipend, housing, travel expenses, and technical support, and they have at their disposal the Exploratorium's full array of metal and woodworking shops and materials. Two artists-in-residence who went on to become staff members have been awarded [[MacArthur Fellowship]] "genius" grants: [[Walter Kitundu]] and [[Ned Kahn]].

The new Embarcadero campus opened with more than 40 pieces by prominent artists, including Douglas Hollis, [[Golan Levin]], [[Lucky Dragons]], [[Amy Balkin]], and [[Fujiko Nakaya]]. The Center for Art and Inquiry, a new project at the new location, is an initiative to catalyze and orchestrate art across the museum.&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;{{cite web|last=Miranda|first=Carolina A.|title=Painting the Sun and Sculpting Fog|url=http://www.artnews.com/2013/03/20/the-new-exploratorium/|work=ARTnews|accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Artful Science from Sunny California |url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13318084.300-review-artful-science-from-sunny-california-.html |author = Peter Turvey|volume = |work= [[New Scientist]] |date = 1992-02-15 |accessdate = 2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium has an equally long history with musical, film and other performances. Participating artists and performers included [[Laurie Anderson]], [[John Cage]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Brian Eno]], [[Ali Akbar Khan]], [[Trimpin]], and [[The Mermen]].&lt;ref name=Speakingofmusic&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaking of Music|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/40th/podcasts.php|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the artists in residence, the museum’s Osher Fellows Program hosts 4-8 resident scholars, scientists, educators, and artists every year. Notable Osher Fellows have included [[Walter Murch]], [[James Crutchfield]], [[Christian de Duve]], [[Arthur Ganson]], [[Tim Hunkin]], [[Lewis Hyde]], [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], [[Guillermo Gómez-Peña]], [[Rosamond Wolff Purcell]], [[Oliver Sacks]], [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], and [[Juan Felipe Herrera]].&lt;ref name=Osher&gt;{{cite web|title=Osher Fellows|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/collaborations/oshers|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are hands-on activities for younger visitors (under 14 - needs confirmation).  The pendulum art activity has a youngster picking four different color markers.  The youngster then pushes a large board suspended by 4 wires to develop a pattern.  At the youngster's say so, the attendant places a selected color into an arm and lowers it onto a white paper weighted to the board.  The marker patterns the movement of the board. After 4 markers are done, the project is complete, signed by the 'young artist', and taken home.

==Influence==

===Impact===
In 2007, the Exploratorium was highlighted in the book ''Forces For Good'' as one of the 12 most effective non-profits in the United States, and was the only West Coast institution and only museum to make the list.&lt;ref name="Crutchfield"&gt;{{cite book|title=Forces for Good: The Six Practices of High-Impact Nonprofits|last1=Crutchfield|first1=Leslie R.|last2=McLeod Grant|first2=Heather|date=October 19, 2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|isbn=978-0787986124|page=22}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2012-06-20 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has inspired science museums worldwide, from the [[Reuben H. Fleet Science Center]] in San Diego to the [[Garden of Archimedes]] in Florence, Italy. In 2003, ''[[The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science]]'' noted that about 400 science centers in 43 countries were established after the example of the Exploratorium.&lt;ref name=Pancaldi&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

===Attendance===
In 2012, 570,000 people visited the Exploratorium; 55% were adults and 45% were children. Geographically, 52% were from the Bay Area, 24% from the rest of California, 14% from other states, and 10% outside the US. Some 36% received free or discounted admission, and 44,000 attended on free admission days. Prior to the relocation, 97,000 students and chaperons visited the museum each year; of these, 67,000 participated in the Field Trip program. It was estimated that 180 million people visited Exploratorium exhibits at science centers and other locations worldwide.&lt;ref name=factsheet /&gt;

Annual attendance at the new Pier 15 location was anticipated to exceed one million.&lt;ref name=Rogers&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=Paul|title=New Exploratorium, with $300 million price tag, to open next week on San Francisco waterfront|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_22982616/gleaming-new-300-million-exploratorium-open-next-wednesday?source=rss|accessdate=20 June 2013|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 2013, the ''New York Times'' reported that although attendance had soared, revenues still fell short of goals, forcing the Exploratorium to lay off around 1/5 of its staff.&lt;ref name=ChangCutback&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|title=Exploratorium Forced to Cut Back|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/science/exploratorium-forced-to-cut-back.html|accessdate=2014-05-15|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museum officials had decided not to make a big publicity push upon reopening, fearing the overcrowding experienced by the [[California Academy of Sciences]] in 2008, but this was later viewed as "an opportunity lost".&lt;ref name="ChangCutback" /&gt;  A staffer (expecting himself to be laid off) observed that the Exploratorium seemed to be "moving from visionary, internally developed work to work-for-hire for other museums around the world”, as the management scrambled to earn more money from consulting for other organizations to replace unrealized admissions revenue.&lt;ref name="ChangCutback" /&gt; On April 17, 2014 the Exploratorium announced that attendance in the first year since re-opening was 1.1 million visitors, and that other key statistics had doubled or tripled.&lt;ref name=Fact2014&gt;{{cite web|last=Slafkosky|first=Jenny|title=Fact Sheet: One Year at Pier 15|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/fact-sheet-one-year-pier-15|work=Exploratorium|publisher=The Exploratorium|accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website===
[[File:Exploratorium Webcast.jpg|thumb|right|''Solar Eclipse'' webcast at the old Exploratorium.]]
Online since 1993, the Exploratorium was one of the first museums to build a site on the World Wide Web.&lt;ref name=Gnatek&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site serves 13 million visitors each year. It has received six [[Webby Award]]s since 1997, including four for Best Science Website and one for Best Education website, and has been an honoree an additional ten times.&lt;ref name=Webby&gt;{{cite web|title=The Webby Awards Gallery and Archive|url=http://winners.webbyawards.com|work=Webby Awards|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium's website is an extension of the experiences on the museum's floor and provides a large number of hands-on activities and exhibits for online-only visitors. The Exploratorium also broadcasts live video and/or audio directly from the museum floor (or from satellite feeds in the field, at such locations as Antarctica or the Belize rainforest) onto the Internet from its Webcast Studio. Webcasts provide access to special events, scientists, and other museum resources for audiences on the Web. Visitors to the website can hear or view interviews with scientists, "meet" interesting people, or tour unique locations from factories to particle accelerators.&lt;ref name=Semper&gt;

The Exploratorium has additionally released two free iPad apps, Sound Uncovered (2013) and Color Uncovered (2011), which assist in making its unique educational model as accessible as possible. Color Uncovered has been downloaded more than a million times.&lt;ref name=iPad&gt;{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Rebecca|title=Exploratorium’s new iPad app reveals ‘magic of existing phenomena’|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/02/12/exploratoriums-new-ipad-app-reveals-magic-of-existing-phenomena/|work=VentureBeat|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===
The Exploratorium has a number of partnerships with other organizations. One notable current partnership is with the [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).  NOAA research vessels periodically berth at the end of Pier 15 and use the working biological labs featured in the museum to bring their research and data to the public. A number of exhibits at the Exploratorium, such as ''Remote Rains'', are based on NOAA data. NOAA scientists additionally provided training for the Explainer program to assist Explainers in explaining science to visitors based on the NOAA’s areas of research.&lt;ref name=Plutchak /&gt;

===Global Studios===
The Exploratorium Global Studios initiative is an entrepreneurial endeavor that shares resources, exhibits, and research with foreign governments, universities, partner museums, libraries, hospitals, and other public and private entities around the world. One area of significant current activity for the Global Studios initiative is the Middle East, where it hopes to assist countries that are making long-term investments in education and transitioning to more information-based economies.&lt;ref name=GlobalStudios&gt;{{cite press release |title=Exploratorium Launches Global Studios, an Entrepreneurial Endeavor to Share Knowledge and Services Around the World |language=English |date=15 November 2012 |publisher=The Exploratorium |location= |url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/exploratorium-launches-global-studios-entrepreneurial-endeavor-share |accessdate=2013-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Tinkering Studio visited a science festival in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia in the summer of 2012, where they trained a group of teachers to help thousands of festival participants to experience the hands-on learning style favored by the Exploratorium.&lt;ref&gt;

==Visiting the museum==
[[File:Wave Organ 2.jpg|thumb|''Wave Organ'' is an off-site Exploratorium exhibit]]

===Hours and access===
The Exploratorium is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10am-5pm, with adults-only evening hours from 6pm-10pm on Thursdays (for visitors age 18+). The entire museum is wheelchair-accessible.

The Exploratorium is located on the [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]] at Green Street, between [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman’s Wharf]] and the [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]]. The museum is accessible by multiple modes of public transit, including [[BART]], [[San Francisco Municipal Railway|Muni]] streetcar, bus, taxi, and [[pedicab]]. It is located {{convert|0.6|mi|km}} from the [[Embarcadero Station|Embarcadero]] BART and MUNI stations, and has its own stop on the [[F Market &amp; Wharves|F streetcar line]]. The Exploratorium does not own or operate any parking lots, but is located near several publicly accessible lots and on-street parking, including a lot directly across the street, operated by the Port of San Francisco.

===Events===
[[Pi Day|Community π Day]] started at the Exploratorium by [[Larry Shaw (Pi)|Larry Shaw]] and is celebrated annually on 3/14 (March 14). [[Iron Science Teacher]] competition (like [[Iron Chef]]) showcases science teachers as they devise classroom activities using a particular ingredient. Monthly events include "Full-Spectrum Science with Ron Hipschman". Every Thursday is "After Dark" for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/calendar|title=Upcoming Events Calendar {{!}} Exploratorium|date=2014-03-17|work=Exploratorium|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related points of interest===
The Exploratorium maintains exhibits in public Bay Area spaces. The Outdoor Exploratorium consists of 14 different exhibits relating to the local environment, all placed outside in the [[Fort Mason]] area and accessible to the general public.&lt;ref name=FrogMom&gt;{{cite web|title=Outdoor Exploratorium: Cool Science at Fort Mason|url=http://frogmom.com/2009/03/outdoor-exploratorium-cool-science-at-fort-mason|date=12 March 2009|work=FrogMom|accessdate=20 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615204459/http://frogmom.com/2009/03/outdoor-exploratorium-cool-science-at-fort-mason|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Wave Organ]]'' is another notable public artwork of the Exploratorium. Created by former staff artist Peter Richards, this acoustic sculpture is situated on a point of land jutting into the San Francisco Bay not far from the Exploratorium’s original Palace of Fine Arts location.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7329">Automatic '''fish counters''' are automatic devices for measuring the number of fish passing along a particular river in a particular period of time. Usually one particular species is of interest.

One important species studied by fish counters are [[Atlantic salmon]]. This species is of interest owing to its ecologically vulnerable status and [[Fish migration|anadromous]] lifestyles.

== Methods of operation ==

Fish counters can be divided into three principal types: resistive counters, optical counters, and hydroacoustic counters.

=== Resistive counters ===

A resistive counter is associated with an in-river structure, an example constituting a Crump weir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gunt.de/networks/gunt/sites/s1/mmcontent/produktbilder/07016033/Datenblatt/07016033%202.pdf Crump weir]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[resistivity]] of a fish is lower than that of water. So, as fish cross this barrier, they pass embedded [[electrodes]], and the difference in resistivity disturbs the field established in the vicinity of the electrodes, altering inter-electrode resistance. With three electrodes these disturbances can then be measured by a [[Wheatstone bridge]], or other means, to detect the size and direction of travel of the fish.

Fish counters of this type are used widely in [[Scotland]] to census populations of Atlantic salmon, where comparison with closed circuit television shows around a 97% detection rate.

=== Optical counters ===

An [http://vaki.is/Products/RiverwatcherFishCounter/ optical counter] is also associated with an in-river structure. However, rather than pass electrodes, in an optical counter the fish interrupt some of a number of vertically arranged beams of light. The pattern of beam-breaks can be used to determine the size, profile, and direction of motion of the fish.

Infrared light is used for minimizing the disturbance of the fish as they will not see the light when passing through the counter. When a fish swims through the net of light beams, the resulting silhouette image is used for counting as well as estimating the size of each fish. Each individual image is memorized in the control unit so that the counting can be verified afterwards.

Some systems such as the [http://riverwatcher.is/ Riverwatcher] use the infrared scanner to trigger a digital camera to capture between 1 and 5 photos or a short video clip of each fish. The computer then automatically links the images to other information contained in the database for that individual fish such as size, passing hour, speed, silhouette image, temperature etc.

The camera is installed in a special tunnel that contains both the camera and lights providing constant light, and same distance from the camera for the fish. That way, it is possible to get good images of the fish regardless of time of day.

The performance of optical counters has been determined by studies, under various conditions, to be greater than 90%. Optical counters can also distinguish the size of fish more accurately than other counter types and so are particularly useful where a mixture of species inhabit a river (for example rivers where salmon mix with [[sea trout]]).

The key disadvantage of optical counters is the small penetration of the beams through the water, restricting their use to narrow river features or in-river structures, an example being fish ladders.

=== Hydroacoustic counters ===
Hydroacoustic counters operate using the principles of [[sonar]]. A fish is insonified by a sound source and reflections from the fish are detected by an underwater microphone. The reflection occurs because of the sudden change in impedance to sound waves within the fish, particularly at the [[swimbladder]] (90% of the reflection).

Hydroacoustic counters do not require in-river structures, but require skilled installation and operators. Without skilled installation at ideal sites hydroacoustic counters can be inaccurate. Studies typically indicate detection rates of 50% to 80%, though one study found detection rates as low as 3%. Careful planning and pre-siting study must be used to determine effectiveness.

The lack of a requirement for any in-river structure makes the counters an attractive proposition.  Generally used for short-term or seasonal studies, some situations require a long-term count which is accurate in absolute terms, not only in relative change (for example, no hydroacoustic sensors are routinely used in the detection of Scottish Atlantic salmon).  In these instances resistivity or optical sensors tend to be preferred.  Such methods usually require significant habitat modification, such as construction of a [[Fishing weir|weir]] to funnel the fish through the counter.

Recent advances in automated hydroacoustic monitoring systems has allowed continuous monitoring for periods exceeding 18 months.  These systems include intelligent monitoring and real-time data processing, ensuring proper operation and publication of status and results (e.g. fish counts) on a routine basis.

== Siting counters  ==

=== In river structures ===
Resistivity and (particularly) optical fish counters require in-river structures to direct the fish through the detection aperture of the counter. [[Fish ladder]]s and Borland fish passes are effective structures for this purpose and occasionally a natural restriction within the river may be used for a similar purpose. However, for most counters a custom in-river structure will be required. One of the most effective such structures is the Crump weir, a triangular profile weir designed to ensure rapid planar flow over the detector.

=== Siting within the river system ===
A species of anadromous fish, such as the Atlantic salmon, may return to a particular breeding ground throughout its life. This means that within the larger rivers a number of quite distinct populations may cross a counter together, in aggregate. A population which uses a particular tributary may collapse whilst the overall numbers are not clearly affected. Issues with the management of that particular tributary and population therefore go unnoticed. Counters should be placed to count individual populations, rather than the species in aggregate, in order that population collapses and recoveries can be detected.

== Alternative methods ==
The results of automatic fish counters can be supplemented, confirmed, or replaced by a number of alternative techniques, varying in accuracy, cost, complexity, and skew effects.

[[File:Flyers sobe 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Hundreds of flyers litter the streets in [[South Beach]], [[Miami]].  Scenes like these are not uncommon in cities known for their [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]]]]
[[File:Helmand leaflets350.jpg|thumb|[[Airborne leaflet propaganda|Distribution of leaflets]] over [[Afghanistan]] by the U.S. military in 2010]]
[[File:Flyers in China 02.jpg|thumb|Flyers pasted to a wall in [[Haikou]], [[Hainan]] Province, [[People's Republic of China|China]]]]

A '''flyer''' is a form of [[paper]] [[advertisement]] intended for wide distribution and typically posted or distributed in a public place, handed out to individuals or sent through the mail. In the 2010s, flyers range from inexpensively [[photocopier|photocopied]] leaflets to expensive, glossy, full-color circulars.

==Terminology==
A flyer is also called a "flier", "circular", "handbill", "[[pamphlet]]", "poster", "lit'" (literature), "weekly ad", "catalogue" or "leaflet".{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Usage==
Flyers may be used by individuals, [[business]]es, not-for-profit organizations or governments to:
* Advertise an event such as a music [[concert]], [[nightclub]] appearance, [[festival]], or political [[Demonstration (people)|rally]]
* Promote a [[Good (economics)|good]]s-selling businesses such as a [[used car]] lot [[discount store]] or a [[Service (economics)|service]] business such as a [[restaurant]] or [[massage parlour]].
* Persuade people about a social, religious, or political message, as in [[evangelism]] or [[political campaign]] activities on behalf of a [[political party]] or candidate during an election. Flyers have been used in armed conflict: for example, [[airborne leaflet propaganda]] has been a tactic of [[psychological warfare]].
* Recruit members for organizations or companies.

Like [[postcard]]s, [[pamphlet]]s and small [[poster]]s, flyers are a low-cost form of [[mass marketing]] or [[communication]]. There are many different flyer formats. Some examples include:
* [[ISO 216#A series|A4]] (roughly [[letterhead]] size)
* A5 (roughly half letterhead size)
* DL ([[compliments slip]] size)
* A6 ([[postcard]] size)

[[File:Commonsense.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|''Common Sense'']] was a pamphlet that was distributed preceding the American Revolution]]
Flyers are inexpensive to produce and they required only a basic [[printing press]] from the 18th century to the 20th century. Their widespread use intensified in the 1990s with the spread of less expensive [[desktop publishing]] systems. In the 2010s, inexpensive black and white flyers can be produced with just a [[personal computer]] and a [[computer printer]]. In the 2010s, the ordering of flyers through traditional printing services has been supplanted by [[Internet]] services. Customers send designs, review proofs online or via e-mail and receive the final products by mail.

Flyers are not a new medium: prior to the [[War of American Independence]] some colonists were outraged with the [[Stamp Act (1765)]] and gathered together in anti-stamp act congresses and meetings. In these congresses they had to win support, and issued handbills and leaflets, pamphlets, along with other written paraphernalia, to do so.

In the 2000s, some jurisdictions have laws or [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] banning or restricting leafleting or flyering in certain locations. Owners of private property may put up signs saying "Post No Bills"; this occurs particularly on wooden fences surrounding building sites or vacant lots.

==Distribution and use==
Flyers are handed out on the [[street]] (a practice known as "flyering" or "leafleting"), distributed door-to-door through the mail, posted on [[bulletin board]]s, put under windshield wipers of cars, given away at events or on the street, or affixed to telephone poles, walls, or other surfaces. Bulletin boards are found on [[college campus]]es, in [[café]]s, community meeting houses, [[laundromat]]s and small markets. Cheap to produce, contemporary flyers are frequently produced in 300&amp;nbsp;[[paper density|g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] glossy card, whereas a leaflet might be produced on a 130&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;–170&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; weight paper and can be a very effective form of [[direct marketing]].

In the 2010s, some individuals and organizations send flyers through [[e-mail]], a tactic that avoids spending money on paper, printing and mailing or hiring people to post the flyers on telephone poles or hand them out. The electronic [http://www.chapmatin.com/%da%86%d8%a7%d9%be-%d8%aa%d8%b1%d8%a7%da%a9%d8%aa/ flyer] may be embedded into the body of the e-mail or added as an attachment to be opened.

"'''Focus Phrase'''" is a term traditionally used in cognitive-therapy and awareness-management discussions, and now in more general use to describe elicitor statements that evoke a desired refocusing of attention. Psychologically related terms are ''elicitor phrase'' or ''statement of intent''.

The psychological term "Focus Phrase" is now used by therapists and life coaches as a general term.

==Definition==

"Focus phrase" is defined as "a specially-constructed short sentence or phrase that states a person's inner intent to refocus his or her attention immediately in a new pre-ordained direction".{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Based both on new research in [[cognitive science]] and on [[cognitive-shifting]] studies of ancient [[meditation]] techniques (see [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]]), focus phrases have been used as a meditative tool and therapy aid, and are being introduced as at-work attentive boosts. They are carefully designed by professionals to almost instantly redirect the mind's attention specifically toward worthwhile sensations, thoughts, images, and other mental experiences. Focus phrases are highly effective in evoking rapid shifts in mental content, quality of awareness, sensory perception, and general inner experience. Therefore, they are considered of high value in meditative methods, and even in creativity-boost techniques.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Traditional cognitive therapy usage==

As explained by the founder of cognitive therapy, [[Aaron Beck]], our chronic thoughtflows (stream of consciousness) tend to dominate our inner experience and stimulate our behavior and emotions. If we want to change our inner experience (for instance from a negative mood to a more positive mood) we need to take charge of the thoughts we are holding in our minds, and state our intent to shift into a preferable mood or quality of consciousness. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The theory of [[cognitive therapy]] teaches that the power of the spoken word in stating one's intent is primary for manifestation of one's intent. In ancient times, the [[Creation myth]] found in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] of the [[Old Testament]] relates that "God said let there be light, and there was light." Perhaps "Let there be light" was the primary focus phrase for our universe. And throughout [[anthropology]] studies, a verbal statement of intent (a blessing; a curse) was considered a decisive act in manifesting that intent.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Business applications==

In corporate awareness-training, focus phrases are used not to change the outer world, but to rapidly shift inner attention, and thus alter personal experience and behavior. For instance, in order to shift rapidly from being lost in thought to present-moment alertness, the following core focus phrase drawn both from [[perceptual]] psychology and ancient [[Yoga]] meditative tradition is used: "I feel the air flowing in and out of my nose." Immediately, as often explained by spiritual teacher [[Alan Watts]] in his numerous books, the words have the psychological power to turn your attention toward the actual breathing experience - which in turn awakens your awareness to sensory experience in the present moment.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Elicitor statements using this general 'focus phrase technology' for mental refocusing can be used to redirect attention toward a more positive mood ("I let go of my worries, and feel peaceful inside"), toward more creative states of mind ("I am open to receive insight into my dilemma"), toward interpersonal relating ("I accept this person just as they are"), or toward any other intent to improve one's experience and behavior.

The term Focus Phrase is recently becoming a more general-usage term found in daily communication, referring to any short sentence intended to help a person's performance or inner experience.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} There is also some negative discussion of the term. In the opposite direction, the term Focus Phrase has been studied academically as a part of a Semantics dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.science.uva.nl/~pdekker/Only/Statements/Bende-Farkas.txt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925030141/http://staff.science.uva.nl/~pdekker/Only/Statements/Bende-Farkas.txt |date=September 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[popular culture]], '''formula fiction''' is [[literature]] in which the storylines and [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s have been reused to the extent that the [[narrative]]s are predictable.  It is similar to [[genre fiction]], which identifies a number of specific settings that are frequently reused.  The label of ''formula fiction'' is used in [[literary criticism]] as a mild [[pejorative]] to imply lack of originality.

Formula fiction is similar to genre fiction. The label of genre fiction is typically assigned because of the reuse of settings, content, layout, and/or style. The label of formula fiction is assigned because of the reuse of plot, [[plot device]]s and [[stock character]]s.

Genres like [[high fantasy]], [[Western movie|Westerns]] and [[science fiction]] [[space opera]] often have specific settings, such as a pseudo-[[Medieval Europe]]an setting, the [[Old West]], or [[outer space]].  Approaching a given genre, certain assumed background information covers the nature and purpose of possible predictable elements of the story, such as the appearance of [[European dragon|dragon]]s and [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]]s in [[high fantasy]], [[Faster than light|warp drives]] in [[science fiction]], or [[shootout]]s at high noon in [[Western movie|Westerns]]. These set-ups are taken for granted by the genre conventions, and need not be explained for the reader anew, though these elements can easily be treated subversively as well, playing with some of the preconceptions inherent in formula fiction.

The ''formula'' is defined specifically by predictable [[narrative structure]]. Formulaic tales incorporate plots that have been reused so often as to be easily recognizable. Perhaps the most clearly formulaic plots characterize the [[romantic comedy]] genre; in a book or film labeled as such, viewers already know its most basic central plot, including to some extent the ending. This does not always prove to be detrimental to a given work's reception however, as the popularity of the aforementioned genre demonstrates.

''Formula fiction'' should not be confused with ''[[pastiche]]'' (the mimicking of another work or author's style), though the latter by its nature may include elements of the former; the same holds true of some [[parody]] and [[satire|satirical]] works as well, which may well include formulaic elements such as common [[stereotype]]s or [[caricature]]s, or which may use formulaic elements in order to mock them or point out their supposedly [[cliché]] or [[realism (arts)|unrealistic]] nature. Indeed, between [[parody]], [[satire]] and such [[subgenre]]s as romantic comedy, [[comedy]] as a whole often relies on either formulaic elements, or the mocking of such elements.

Formula fiction is often stereotypically associated with early [[pulp magazine]] markets, though some works published in that medium, such as "[[The Cold Equations]]", subvert the supposed expectations of the common narrative formula of that time.

The dissection and tracking of common formulaic [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s (as well as their subversions and new permutations) has become reasonably popular beyond strictly academic circles. (The [[Final Girl]] being one such example, as well as, to some extent, Campbell's ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''). [[Amateur]] circles have websites such as the [[TV Tropes|TV Tropes Wiki]].

The '''Glagolita Clozianus''' is a 14-folio [[Glagolitic script|Glagolitic]] [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[Old_Church_Slavonic#Canon|canon]] [[miscellany]], written in the eleventh century.

What remained of an originally very large codex, having probably 552 folios (1104 pages), are 14 folios containing five [[homily|homilies]]. Two of the homilies are complete; one by [[John Chrysostom]] and one by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], and three of them are fragments, one by John Chrysostom, one by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] and one that is usually attributed to [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Methodius]]. Four of those homilies are known from other Old Church Slavonic codices, the exception being the one usually attributed to St. Methodius, which is found only in Clo, and sometimes referred to as the ''Anonymous Homily''.

The codex was named after the Count [[Paris Cloz]] who owned it in the first half of the 19th century. Prior to that, up until the end of the 15th century, it was owned by the Croatian nobles of the [[House of Frankopan]], who used the codex as a house [[relic]] (it was bound with silver and gold) in worship, believing St. [[Jerome]] to be the author. Count Cloz donated the codex to the City Museum in [[Trento|Trent]], where the first 12 folios are being kept today. The remaining 2 folios, discovered by Slovene Slavist [[Franc Miklošič]], are kept in the [[Ferdinandeum]] museum in [[Innsbruck]].

Linguists somewhat disagree when discussing the source of the text; some, arguing on the similarity of the rounded Glagolitic with Sinaitic codices ([[Psalterium Sinaiticum]], [[Euchologium Sinaiticum]]), hold that the manuscript originated in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and others that it was written in [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatia]], justifying it with the change of ''ь'' to ''ъ'' behind palatal ''č'', ''ž'', ''št'' and ''žd'', a trait commonly found in other Croatian Glagolitic mediaeval manuscripts. The reasonable conclusion that follows is that the manuscript was copied on the Croatian territory from the original written in Macedonia.

The text was first published by [[Jernej Kopitar|Jernej B. Kopitar]] (Vienna 1836, the first 12 folios), together with the [[Freising Fragments]] and the manuscript ''De conversione Bagaorium et Carantanorum''. Franc Miklošič published two folios from Innsbruck in 1860, and both pieces were published together by I. I. Sreznjevski in 1866. Critical edition with Ancient Greek originals was published by [[Václav Vondrák]] (''Glagolita Clozùv'' 1893) and finally by [[Antonín Dostál]] (''Clozianus, staroslověnsky hlaholský sborník tridentský a innsbrucký'', Prague 1959). Dostal's edition contains photographs, Cyrillic transcription, Ancient Greek original, translations to Czech and a dictionary.

'''[[Green building]]''' results in structures that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout their lifecycle – from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igreenbuild.com/cd_1967.aspx |title=GreenBuild.com |publisher=Igreenbuild.com |date=2005-12-06 |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2009 report by the U.S. [[General Services Administration]] evaluated 12 sustainably designed GSA buildings, and found they cost less to operate and have excellent energy performance. In addition, occupants were more satisfied with the overall building than those in typical commercial buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalmarketspartnership.com/UserFiles/Admin%20GSA%20June%202008%20-%20Assessing%20Green%20Building%20Performance.pdf |title=GSA Public Buildings Service Assessing Green Building Performance A Post-Occupancy Evaluation of 12 GSA Buildings |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Wood products]]''' from responsible sources are a good choice for most green building projects – both new construction and renovations. Wood grows naturally using energy from the sun, is renewable, sustainable and recyclable. It is an effective insulator and uses far less energy to produce than concrete or steel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodworks.org/woodBenefits/sustainableDesign/default.aspx WoodWorks Sustainable Design] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818041504/http://www.woodworks.org/woodBenefits/sustainableDesign/default.aspx |date=August 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood can also mitigate climate change because wood products continue to store carbon absorbed by the tree during its growing cycle, and because substituting wood for fossil fuel-intensive materials such as steel and concrete result in ‘avoided’ greenhouse gas emissions. 

Wood’s natural beauty and warmth have been shown to generate improved productivity and performance in schools, offices and better patient outcomes in hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://continuingeducation.construction.com/article.php?L=221&amp;C=694 |title=McGraw Hill Construction How Wood Products Stack Up in Green Building Systems |publisher=Continuingeducation.construction.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle assessment==

A [[life cycle assessment]] can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental, social and economic concerns by assessing each and every impact associated with all the stages of a process from cradle-to-grave (i.e., from raw materials through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling).

A comprehensive review of scientific literature from Europe, North America and Australia pertaining to life cycle assessment of wood products &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discover-decouvrir.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/dcvr/ctrl?action=shwart&amp;aix=3&amp;aid=7314557 |title=Abstract Wooden building products in comparative LCA 2007 |publisher=Discover-decouvrir.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca |date=2010-03-29 |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded, among other things, that:
* Fossil fuel consumption, the potential contributions to the greenhouse effect and the quantities of solid waste tend to be minor for wood products compared to competing products.
* Wood products that have been installed and are used in an appropriate way tend to have a favourable environmental profile compared to functionally equivalent products out of other materials.

A study by the [[Canadian Wood Council]] compared the life cycle impacts of three {{convert|2400|sqft|m2|adj=on}} homes designed primarily in wood, steel and concrete over the first 20 years of their lifespans. Relative to the wood design, the steel and concrete designs released more air pollution, produced more solid wastes, used more resources, required more energy, emitted more greenhouse gases and discharged more water pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwc.ca/DesignWithWood/Sustainability/?Language=EN Canadian Wood Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312112233/http://www.cwc.ca/DesignWithWood/Sustainability/?Language=EN |date=March 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the complete life cycle is considered, including use and disposal, the great majority of the studies indicate that wood products have lower greenhouse gas emissions. In the few cases where wood products cause greater greenhouse gas emissions than their non-wood counterparts, the cause was inappropriate post-use disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |title=FPInnovations 2010 A Synthesis of Research on Wood Products and Greenhouse Gas Impacts Page 6 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321215904/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tools are available that enable architects to judge the relative environmental merits of building materials. They include the [[ATHENA Impact Estimator for Buildings]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athenasmi.org/tools/impactEstimator/index.html |title=ATHENA Institute Impact Estimator for Buildings |publisher=Athenasmi.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is capable of modeling 95% of the building stock in North America, and the ATHENA® EcoCalculator for Assemblies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athenasmi.org/tools/ecoCalculator/index.html ATHENA Institute EcoCalculator for Assemblies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014164446/http://www.athenasmi.org/tools/ecoCalculator/index.html |date=October 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  provides instant life cycle assessment results for common assemblies based on detailed assessments previously conducted using the Estimator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athenasmi.org/about/index.html |title=ATHENA Institute |publisher=Athenasmi.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EcoCalculator is available free from the non-profit [http://www.athenasmi.org Athena Sustainable Materials Institute] in order to encourage greater use of LCA by design and building professionals.

==Wood and climate change==

As trees grow, they absorb carbon dioxide and store it in biomass (wood, leaves, roots). When trees decompose or burn, much of the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, mainly as carbon dioxide, and some of the carbon remains in the forest debris and soils.&lt;ref name="naturallywood1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturallywood.com/uploadedFiles/General/Header/tackle-climate-change.pdf |title=Tackle Climate Change, Use Wood |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a tree is cut and the wood is used for products such as structural lumber or furniture, the carbon is stored for decades or longer. A typical {{convert|2400|sqft|m2|adj=on}} home in North America contains 29 metric tonnes of carbon, or the equivalent of offsetting the greenhouse gas emissions produced by driving a passenger car over five years (about 12,500 litres of gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpinnovations.ca/ |title=FPInnovations Wood and Climate Change |publisher=Fpinnovations.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
 
When wood replaces a fossil fuel for energy or a construction material with a greater greenhouse gas footprint, this lowers greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="naturallywood1"/&gt;

Studies show that wood products are associated with far less greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetime than other major building materials. Substituting a cubic metre of blocks or brick with wood results in a significant saving of 0.75 to one tone of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/rome2007/docs/Using_wood_products_to_mitigate_climate_change.pdf |title=Using Wood Products to Mitigate Climate Change Page 7 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Increasing the use of wood products in construction and for other long-lived uses, plus the use of wood byproducts and wood waste as biomass replacement for fossil fuels, can contribute to atmospheric greenhouse gas stabilization. The sustainable management of forests for the production of wood products is a feasible and beneficial part of an overall strategy to mitigate climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |title=FPInnovations 2010 A Synthesis of Research on Wood Products and Greenhouse Gas Impacts Page 8 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321215904/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Securing the Future]], a United Kingdom government strategy for sustainable development, stated: “Forestry practices can make a significant contribution by reducing greenhouse gas emissions through increasing the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere by the national forest estate, by burning wood for fuel, and by using wood as a substitute for energy-intensive materials such as concrete and steel.”

==The role of wood in carbon balances==

[[FPInnovations]], a Canadian non-profit research organization, conducted a literature review of 66 scientific peer-reviewed articles regarding the net impact on atmospheric greenhouse gases due to wood product use within a life cycle perspective. It showed several ways wood product substitution affects greenhouse gas balances, including:

* Less fossil fuel consumption in manufacturing;
* Avoidance of industrial process carbon emissions from cement manufacturing when wood products replace cement-based products;
* Carbon storage in wood products and in the forest; and
* Avoided fossil fuel emissions when wood biofuels replace fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |title=FPInnovations 2010 A Synthesis of Research on Wood Products and Greenhouse Gas Impacts Page 3 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321215904/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency==

As high-performance buildings use less operating energy, the embodied energy required to extract, process, transport and install building materials may make up as much as 30% of the overall life cycle energy consumption. Studies such as the U.S. LCI Database Project show buildings built primarily with wood will have a lower embodied energy than those built primarily with brick, concrete or steel.

A recent case study of the Eugene Kruger Building in Quebec, Canada determined that the all-wood solution adopted for this 8,000-square-metre academic building resulted in a 40% reduction in embodied energy compared to steel and concrete alternatives.

A 2002 study compared production energy values for building components (e.g. walls, floors, roofs) made predominantly of wood, steel and concrete, and found that wood construction has a range of energy use from 185 to 280 Gigajoules (GJ), concrete from 265 to 521 GJ, and steel from 457 to 649 GJ. Wood construction will generally use less energy than other materials, although the high end of the range of wood construction energy overlaps with the low end of the range of concrete construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |title=FPInnovations 2010 A Synthesis of Research on Wood Products and Greenhouse Gas Impacts Page 42 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321215904/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Passive design]] uses natural processes – convection, absorption, radiation, and conduction – to minimize energy consumption and improve thermal comfort. Researchers in Europe have identified wood as a suitable material in the development of passive buildings due to its unique combination of properties, including thermal resistance, natural finish, structural integrity, light weight and weatherproof qualities. Passive design is beginning to be incorporated in small buildings in North America through the use of structural wood panels.
 
Due to its cellular structure and lots of tiny air pockets, wood is a better natural insulator in most climates – 400 times better than steel and 10 times better than concrete. More insulation is needed for steel and concrete to achieve the same thermal performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturallywood.com/uploadedFiles/General/Green_Building/Module-3_Energy_Conservation.pdf |title=Naturally:wood Green Building Toolkit Module 3 Energy Conservation |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2002 study prepared by the [[National Association of Home Builders]] Research Center Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.p2pays.org/ref/15/14083.pdf |title=NAHB Research Center Inc. Steel vs. Wood: Long-Term Thermal Performance Comparison 2002 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared long-term energy use in two nearly identical side-by-side homes, one framed with conventional dimensional lumber and the second framed with cold-formed steel. It found the steel-framed house used 3.9% more natural gas in the winter and 10.7% more electricity in the summer.

==Health and well-being==

Solid wood products, particularly flooring, are often specified in environments where occupants are known to have allergies to dust or other particulates. 

Wood itself is considered to be hypo-allergenic and its smooth surfaces prevent the buildup of particles common in soft finishes like carpet. The use of wood products can also improve air quality by absorbing or releasing moisture in the air to moderate humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturallywood.com/resources |title=Naturally:wood Green Building with Wood Toolkit |publisher=Naturallywood.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A study at the University of British Columbia and FPInnovations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/28644 |title=Wood in the Human Environment: Restorative Properties of Wood in the Build Indoor Environment Fell, David Robert |publisher=Circle.ubc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the visual presence of wood in a room lowers [[sympathetic nervous system]] (SNS) activation in occupants, further establishing the positive link between wood and human health. SNS activation is the way human bodies prepare themselves to deal with stress. It increases blood pressure and heart rate while inhibiting digestion, recovery and repair functions in order to deal with immediate threats. While necessary in the short term, prolonged periods in an SNS-activated state have a negative effect on the body’s physiological and psychological health.

The study supports wood’s value as a tool in [[evidence-based design]] (EBD) – a growing field that seeks to promote health and other positive outcomes such as increased productivity and well-being based on scientifically credible evidence. So far, EBD has focused largely on healthcare and, in particular, patient recovery.

==Reducing waste==

Green building seeks to avoid wasting energy, water and materials during construction. Design and building professionals can reduce construction waste through design optimization, using right-sized framing members, for example, or pre-manufactured and engineered components.

The wood industry reduces waste in a similar way by optimizing sawmill operations and by using wood chips and sawdust to produce paper and composite products, or as fuel for renewable bioenergy. North American wood producers use 98 percent of every tree harvested and brought to a mill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://woodworks.org/files/PDF/publications/Green_Bldg.pdf |title=Wood and Green Building |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than demolishing structures at the end of their useful life, they are deconstructed to reclaim useful building materials rather than dumping them in the landfill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jgpress.com/inbusiness/archives/_free/000648.html In Business magazine Green Builders Get Big Help from Deconstruction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121092246/http://www.jgpress.com/inbusiness/archives/_free/000648.html |date=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
When used properly, wood, concrete and steel can last for decades or centuries. In North America, most structures are demolished because of external forces such as zoning changes and rising land values. Designing for flexibility and adaptability secures the greatest value for the [[embodied energy]] in building materials. 

Wood is versatile and flexible, making it the easiest construction material for renovations. Wood buildings can be redesigned to suit changing needs, whether this involves adding a new room or moving a window or door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturallywood.com/why-wood |title=Naturally:wood |publisher=Naturallywood.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood structures are typically easy to adapt to new uses because the material is so light and easy to work with. Few homeowner or professional remodelers have the skill and equipment needed to alter steel-frame structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwc.ca/Resources/Tips/#Q18 |title=Canadian Wood Council |publisher=Cwc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural wood members can typically be reclaimed and reused for the same or similar purpose with only minor modifications or wastage, or remilled and fashioned into alternate products such as window and door frames.
To reduce the amount of wood that goes to landfill, the CO2 Neutral Alliance (a coalition of government, NGOs and the forest industry) created the website dontwastewood.com. The site includes resources for regulators, municipalities, developers, contractors, owner/operators and individuals/homeowners looking for information on wood recycling.

==Responsible sourcing==

Wood is a responsible environmental choice for construction as long as it comes from forests that are managed sustainably. [[Illegal logging]] and the international trade in illegally logged timber is a major problem for many timber-producing countries in the developing world. It causes environmental damage, costs governments billions of dollars in lost revenue, promotes corruption, undermines the rule of law and good governance and funds armed conflict. Consumer countries can use their buying power by ensuring the wood products they buy are from known and legal sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illegal-logging.info/ |title=Illegal-Logging.info |publisher=Illegal-Logging.info |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deforestation, which is the permanent removal of forests where the land is converted to other uses such as agriculture or housing, is also a significant problem in developing countries, and globally accounts for 17% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. 

The forests most vulnerable to destruction are in tropical regions of the world, where the rate of deforestation was estimated at {{convert|32000000|acre|km2}} a year from 1990 to 2005. According to the State of the World’s Forests Report, 2007, “the world lost about 3 percent of its forest area from 1990 to 2005; but, in North America, the total forest area remained virtually constant.” When forest land is converted for other uses, a portion of the deforestation can be offset by afforestation—such as the planting of trees on land that has been bare of trees for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcclimatechange.org/ Tackle Climate Change – Use Wood book]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0773e/a0773e00.HTM |title=State of the World’s Forests, 2007 |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntary third-party forest certification is a credible tool for communicating the environmental and social performance of forest operations.&lt;ref name="metafore1"&gt;{{cite web|author=GreenBlue |url=http://www.metafore.org/index.php?p=About+Certification&amp;s=153 |title=Metafore |publisher=Metafore |date=2012-05-22 |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; With forest certification, an independent organization develops standards of good forest management, and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards. This certification verifies that forests are well-managed – as defined by a particular standard – and ensures that certified wood and paper products come from legal and responsible sources.&lt;ref name="metafore1"/&gt;

==Green building rating systems==

A 2010 study by the [[Light House Sustainable Building Centre]] in British Columbia, Canada examined the ways in which the world’s major voluntary green building rating systems incorporate wood. It found that rating systems for single family homes in North America were the most inclusive of wood products and rating systems for commercial buildings and buildings outside of North America were the least inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://continuingeducation.construction.com/article.php?L=221&amp;C=694McGraw Hill Construction How Wood Products Stack Up in Green Building Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;
Systems studied included [[BREEAM]] (United Kingdom), Built Green (United States and Canada), CASBEE (Japan), [[Green Globes]] (United States), [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] (Australia), [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] (launched in United States and used in countries such as Canada, China, India and Mexico), [[Living Building Challenge]] (United States and Canada), the [[NAHB – National Green Building Program]] (United States), and the SB Tool (Canada and UK). 

In most cases, the rating systems offer credits/point for the use of wood in the following areas: certified wood; recycled /reused /salvaged materials; and local sourcing of materials. In some cases, building techniques and skills (such as advanced framing) and waste minimalization are recognized, and most demand that all wood adhesives, resins, engineered and composite products contain no added [[urea formaldehyde]] and have strict limits on VOC ([[volatile organic compound]]) content.

==LEED certified wood credit==
{{see also|Certified wood}}

In December 2010, the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] failed to get enough yes votes from members for a proposed rewrite of the certified wood policy in its [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) rating system. Since its inception, LEED has only accepted wood certified to Forest Stewardship Council standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ndash; Tristan Roberts |url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/2010/12/7/Not-Enough-Votes-for-LEED-Certified-Wood-Benchmark/ |title=Environmental Building News |publisher=Buildinggreen.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The two largest third-party forest certification standards in the United States – the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fscus.org/green_building/index.php |title=Forest Stewardship Council |publisher=Fscus.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/leed/index.php |title=Sustainable Forestry Initiative |publisher=Sfiprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; – opposed the proposed benchmarks.

A number of organizations, including the [[National Association of State Foresters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stateforesters.org/node/886 |title=National Association of State Foresters Resolution 2008-6: Green Building and the Role of Wood Products |publisher=Stateforesters.org |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Canadian Institute of Forestry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cif-ifc.org/uploads//Website_Assets/USGB_media_release_April_19_2010.pdf |title=Canadian Institute of Forestry |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Society of American Foresters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goergen |first=Michael T. |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2011509983_guest03green.html |title=Michael Goergen, Society of American Foresters Column in Seattle Times |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=2010-04-02 |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; called for LEED to recognize all credible certification programs to encourage the use of wood as a green building material.

In its 2008-2009 Forest Products Annual Review, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe/Food and Agriculture Organization stated that green building initiatives (GBI) can be a mixed blessing for wood products. “GBI standards giving exclusive recognition to particular
forest-certification brands may help drive demand for these brands at the expense of wider appreciation of the environmental merits of wood.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/Final_FPAMR2009.pdf |title=2008-2009 UNECE-FAO Forest Products Annual Review Page 123 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2009-2010 review, the UNECE/FAO reported growing convergence between certification systems: "Over the years, many of the issues that previously divided the (certification) systems have become much less distinct. The largest certification systems now generally have the same structural programmatic requirements." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/Final_FPAMR2009.pdf |title=2008-2009 UNECE-FAO Forest Products Annual Review Page 121 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=February 2009}} 
{{aquatic layer topics}}

In [[oceanography]], a '''halocline''' (from Greek ''hals'', halo- 'salt' and ''klinein'' 'to slope') is a subtype of [[chemocline]] caused by a strong, vertical [[salinity]] [[gradient]] within a body of [[water]].  Because salinity (in concert with [[temperature]]) affects the [[density]] of [[seawater]], it can play a role in its vertical [[stratification (water)|stratification]].  Increasing salinity by one kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; results in an increase of seawater density of around 0.7&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

In the midlatitudes, an excess of evaporation over precipitation leads to surface waters being saltier than deep waters. In such regions, the vertical stratification is due to surface waters being warmer than deep waters and the halocline is destabilizing. Such regions may be prone to [[salt fingering]], a process which results in the preferential mixing of salinity.

In certain high latitude regions (such as the [[Arctic Ocean]], [[Bering Sea]], and the [[Southern Ocean]]) the surface waters are actually colder than the deep waters and the halocline is responsible for maintaining water column stability, isolating the surface waters from the deep waters. In these regions, the halocline is important in allowing for the formation of sea ice, and limiting the escape of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. 

Haloclines are also found in [[fjords]], and poorly mixed [[estuaries]] where fresh water is deposited at the ocean surface.

==Description==
[[File:Arctic sea temperature salinity plot.svg|thumb|left|Plot of temperature and salinity in the Arctic Ocean at 85,18 north and 117,28 east dated Jan. 1st 2010.&lt;ref name="gtsppdata"&gt;U.S. National Oceanographic Data Center: Global Temperature–Salinity Profile Programme. June 2006. U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Oceanographic Data Center, Silver Spring, Maryland, 20910. Date of Access, http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/GTSPP/&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the plot, one can discern three layers: 
* About {{cvt|50|m|}} of low salinity water "swimming" on top of the ocean. The temperature is {{cvt|-1.8|°C|}}, which is very near to the freezing point. This layer blocks heat transfer from the warmer, deeper levels into the sea ice, which has considerable effect on its thickness.
* About {{cvt|150|m|}} of steeply rising salinity and increasing temperature. This is the actual halocline.
* The deep layer with nearly constant salinity and slowly decreasing temperature.

A halocline can be easily created and observed in a drinking glass or other clear vessel.  If fresh water is slowly poured over a quantity of salt water, using a spoon held horizontally at water-level to prevent mixing, a hazy interface layer, the halocline, will soon be visible due to the varying [[index of refraction]] across the boundary.

A halocline is most commonly confused with a [[thermocline]] – a thermocline is an area within a body of water that marks a drastic change in temperature. 
                    
Haloclines are common in water-filled [[limestone]] caves near the ocean. Less dense fresh water from the land forms a layer over salt water from the ocean. For underwater cave explorers, this can cause the optical illusion of air space in caverns. Passing through the halocline tends to stir up the layers.

==Types of clines==
* [[Thermocline]] – A cline based on difference in water [[temperature]],
* [[Chemocline]] – A cline based on difference in water [[chemistry]],
* [[Pycnocline]] – A cline based on difference in water [[density]].

[[File:Western Scrub Jay.jpg|thumb|238px|[[Western scrub jay]]s cache food such as acorns and insects.]]

'''Hoarding''' or '''caching''' in [[ethology|animal behavior]] is the storage of food in locations hidden from the sight of both [[Conspecificity|conspecifics]] (animals of the same or closely related species) and members of other species.&lt;ref&gt;Vander Wall, Stephen B. (1990) Food Hoarding in Animals. University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-84735-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly, the function of hoarding or caching is to store food in times of surplus for times when food is less plentiful. However, there is evidence that some amount of caching or hoarding is done in order to ripen the food, called ripening caching.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soley|first=F. G.|last2=Alvarado-Díaz|first2=I.|date=2011|title=Prospective thinking in a mustelid? Eira barbara (Carnivora) cache unripe fruits to consume them once ripened|journal=Naturwissenschaften|language=en|volume=98|issue=8|pages=693–698|doi=10.1007/s00114-011-0821-0|pmid=21739130|issn=0028-1042}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term hoarding is most typically used for [[rodent]]s, whereas caching is more commonly used in reference to [[bird]]s, but the behaviors in both animal groups are quite similar.

Hoarding is done either on a long-term basis – cached on a seasonal cycle, with food to be consumed months down the line – or on a short term basis, in which case the food will be consumed over a period of one or several days.

Some common animals that cache their food are [[rodent]]s such as [[hamster]]s and [[squirrel]]s, and many different [[bird]] species, such as [[rook (bird)|rook]]s and [[woodpecker]]s.  The [[western scrub jay]] is noted for its particular skill at caching.  There are two types of caching behavior: larder-hoarding, where a species creates a few large caches which it often defends, and scatter-hoarding, where a species will create multiple caches, often with each individual food item stored in a unique place. Both types of caching have their advantage.

== Function ==
Caching behavior is typically a way to save excess edible food for later consumption - either soon to be eaten food, such as when a jaguar hangs a partially eaten prey in a tree to be eaten within a few days, or long term where the food is hidden and retrieved many months later. Caching is a common [[adaptation]] to seasonal changes in food availability. In regions where winters are harsh, food availability typically becomes low, and caching food during the times of high food availability in the warmer months provides a significant survival advantage.  This phenomenon is referenced in the fable [[The Ant and the Grasshopper]].

However, in '''ripening caching''' behavior, animals collect and cache food which is immediately inedible but will become "ripe" and edible after a short while. For instance, [[tayra]]s (a Central American weasel) have been observed to harvest whole green [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, hide them, and then come back to eat them after they have ripened.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Crocodilians such as the [[alligator]] are predators with ineffective teeth action - they can bite prey to kill it but can't tear flesh or chew. Small enough prey are swallowed whole while for larger prey, such as a deer, the carcass is cached underwater and left to rot (or "ripen") until it is easy to eat. [[Leafcutter ant]]s harvest pieces of inedible leaves and then cache them in underground chambers to ripen with a fungus which is the main food for the colony.

== Hoard distribution and size ==
'''Scatter hoarding''' is the formation of a large number of small hoards.  This behavior is present in both birds (especially the [[Gray jay]]) and small mammals, mainly squirrels and other rodents, such as the [[eastern gray squirrel]], [[fox squirrel]], and [[wood mouse]]. Specifically, those who do not migrate to warmer climates or hibernate for winter are most likely to scatter hoard.&lt;ref name="SDR in Gray Jays"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Waite|first1=Thomas A.|title=Social Hoarding and a Load Size-Distance Relationship in Gray Jays|issue=4|pages=995–998|url=https://sora.unm.edu/node/104654|journal=Condor|volume=94|accessdate=21 November 2016|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1939354 | last1 = Jokinen | first1 = S | last2 = Suhonen | first2 = J | year = 1995 | title = Food Caching By Willow and Crested Tits: A Test of Scatterhoarding Models | jstor = 1939354| journal = Ecology | volume = 76 | issue = 3| pages = 892–898 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thor"&gt;Thorington, R.W., Jr., Koprowski, J.L., Steele, M.A., and Whatton, J. (2012) [https://www.amazon.com/Squirrels-World-Richard-Thorington-Jr/dp/1421404699  ''Squirrels of the World'']. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 472 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior plays an important part in [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], as those seeds that are left uneaten will have a chance to [[Germination|germinate]], thus enabling plants to spread their [[population]]s effectively.

'''Cache spacing''' is the primary technique that scatter hoarders use to protect food from pilferers. By spreading the food supply around geographically, hoarders discourage competitors who happen upon a cache from conducting area-restricted searching for more of the supply. Despite cache spacing, however, hoarders are still unable to completely eliminate the threat of [[pilferage]].&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, R. R. &amp; Sherry, D. F. (1994) The effects of cache loss on choice of cache sites in the black-capped [[chickadee]]. Behav. Ecol. 5:44-50&lt;/ref&gt; However, having multiple cache sites is costly because it requires a good memory. Scatter-hoarders generally have a large [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dally | first1 = Joanna M. | last2 = Emery | first2 = Nathan J. | last3 = Clayton | first3 = Nicola S. | year = 2005 | title = Cache protection strategies by western scrub-jays, Aphelocoma californica: implications for social cognition | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 70 | issue = 6| pages = 1251–1263 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.02.009| citeseerx = 10.1.1.183.6317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''larder hoarding''', the hoard is large and is found in a single place termed a [[larder]], which usually also serves as the nest where the animal lives.  [[Hamster]]s are famous larder hoarders. Indeed, the German verb "hamstern" (to hoard) is derived from the noun "Hamster" which refers to the rodent; similar verbs are found in various related languages ([[Dutch (language)|Dutch]] ''hamsteren'', and [[Swedish (language)|Swedish]] ''hamstra''). Other languages also draw a clear connection between hamsters and hoarding: [[Polish language|Polish]] ''chomikować'', from ''chomik'' – hamster; [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''hamster''; ''oger'' (אוגר) comes from ''to hoarde''; ''le'egor'' (לאגור). A disadvantage of larder hoarding is that if a cache is raided, this is far more problematic for the animal than if it were a scatter hoarder.  While the hoard is much easier to remember the location of, these larger hoards must also be more staunchly defended.

;Guarding
Most species are particularly wary of onlooking individuals during caching and ensure that the cache locations are [[secret]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dally | first1 = Joanna M. | last2 = Emery | first2 = Nathan J. | last3 = Clayton | first3 = Nicola S. | year = 2006 | title = Food-Caching Western Scrub-Jays Keep Track of Who Was Watching When | url = | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5780| pages = 1662–1665 | doi = 10.1126/science.1126539 | pmid=16709747}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, B. &amp; Pepper, J. W. (1998) Influence of competitors on caching behavior in the common [[raven]], ''Corvus corax''. Anim. Behav. 56:1083-1090&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Emery | first1 = N.

;Shared or individual hoarding
Although a small handful of species share food stores, food hoarding is a solo endeavor for most species, including almost all rodents and birds. For example, a number of jays live in large family groups, but they don't demonstrate sharing of cached food. Rather, they hoard their food supply selfishly, caching and retrieving the supply in secret.&lt;ref&gt;Waite, T.A., (1992). Gray jay scatterhoarding behavior, rate maximization and the effect of local cache density. Ornis. Scand., 23: 175-182&lt;/ref&gt;

There are only two species  in which kin selection has resulted in a shared food store, i.e. [[beavers]] (''Castor canadensis'') and [[acorn woodpecker]]s (''Melanerpes formicivorous''); the former live in family groups and construct winter larders of submerged branches, while the latter are unusual in that they construct a conspicuous communal larder.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig, W.D. and Mumme, R.L., (1987). ''Population Ecology of the Cooperatively Breeding Acorn Woodpecker''. Princeton, New Jersey. Princeton University Press. 0691084645&lt;/ref&gt;

;Pilfering
'''Pilferage''' occurs when one animal takes food from another animal's larder.
Some species experience high levels of cache pilferage, up to 30% of the supply per day. Models of scatter hoarding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stapanian | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Smith | first2 = C.C. | year = 1978 | title = A model for seed scatterhoarding: coevolution of fox squirrels and black walnuts | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 59 | issue = 5| pages = 884–896 | doi=10.2307/1938541| jstor = 1938541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stapanian | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Smith | first2 = C.C. | year = 1984 | title = Density-dependent survival of scatterhoarded nuts: an experimental approach | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 65 | issue = 5| pages = 1387–1396 | doi=10.2307/1939119| jstor = 1939119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clarkson | first1 = K. | last2 = Eden | first2 = S.F. | last3 = Sutherland | first3 = W.J. | last4 = Houston | first4 = A.I. | year = 1986 | title = Density, dependence and magpie hoarding | url = | journal = J. Anim. Ecol. | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 111–121 | doi=10.2307/4696| jstor = 4696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested the value of cached food is equal to the hoarders ability to retrieve it.&lt;ref name="Vander Wall"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vander Wall | first1 = S.B. | last2 = Jenkins | first2 = S.H. | year = 2003 | title = Reciprocal pilferage and the evolution of food-hoarding behavior | doi = 10.1093/beheco/arg064 | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 656–667 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Reciprocal pilfering
It has been observed that members of certain species, such as [[rodents]] and [[chickadees]], act as both hoarder and pilferer. In other words, pilfering can be reciprocal and, thus, tolerable. Although this kind of food caching system seems cooperative, it has been suggested that it is actually driven by the selfish interests of the individual.&lt;ref name="Vander Wall" /&gt;

;Recaching
Animals recache the food that they've pilfered from other animal's caches.
For example, 75% percent of mildly radioactive (thus [[isotopic labeling|traceable]]) Jeffrey pine seeds cached by yellow pine chipmunks were found in two cache sites, 29% of the seeds were found in three sites, 9.4% were found in four sites and 1.3% were found in five sites over a 3-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vander Wall | first1 = S.B. | last2 = Joyner | first2 = J.W. | year = 1998 | title = Recaching of Jeffrey pine (''Pinus jeffreyi'') seeds by yellow pine chipmunks (''Tamias amoenus''): potential effects on plant reproductive success | url = | journal = Can. J. Zool. | volume = 76 | issue = | pages = 154–162 | doi=10.1139/cjz-76-1-154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These results, and those from other studies, demonstrate the dynamic nature of the food supplies of scatter hoarding animals.

;Deception
Group-foraging [[common raven]]s, (''Corvus corax''), scatter hoard their food and also raid the caches made by others. Cachers withdraw from [[Conspecificity|conspecifics]] when hiding their food and most often place their caches behind structures, obstructing the view of potential observers. Raiders watch inconspicuously and keep at a distance to cachers close to their cache sites. In response to the presence of potential raiders or because of their initial movements towards caches, the cachers frequently interrupt caching, change cache sites, or recover their food items. These behaviors suggest that ravens are capable of withholding information about their intentions, which may qualify as [[Deception in animals|tactical deception]].&lt;ref name="Bugnyarf and Kotrschal, (2002)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bugnyarf | first1 = T. | last2 = Kotrschal | first2 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Observational learning and the raiding of food caches in ravens, ''Corvus corax'': is it 'tactical' deception? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 185–195 | doi=10.1006/anbe.2002.3056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Eurasian jay]]s (''Garrulus glandarius'') when being watched by another jay, prefer to cache food behind an opaque barrier rather than a transparent barrier, suggesting they may opt to cache in out-of-view locations to reduce the likelihood of other jays pilfering their caches.&lt;ref name="Legg"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Legg, E.W.  |author2=Clayton, N.S.|year=2014|title=Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius) conceal caches from onlookers|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=17|issue=5|pages=1223–1226|doi=10.1007/s10071-014-0743-2|pmid=24638877|pmc=4138428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexuality also affects and is affected by cultural, political, legal, philosophical, [[morality|moral]], [[ethical]], and religious aspects of life.&lt;ref name="S. Greenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolin"/&gt;

Interest in sexual activity typically increases when an individual reaches [[puberty]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Neil R. and C. Donald Heth. "Psychology: the Science of Behaviour." 4th Edition. Toronto: Pearson Canada Inc., 2007. 684.&lt;/ref&gt; Opinions differ on the origins of an individual's sexual orientation and sexual behavior. Some argue that sexuality is determined by [[genetics]], while others believe it is molded by the environment, or that both of these factors interact to form the individual's sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="AmPsycholAssn-whatis"/&gt; This pertains to the [[nature versus nurture]] debate.  In the former, one assumes that the features of a person innately correspond to their natural inheritance, exemplified by drives and instincts; the latter refers to the assumption that the features of a person continue to change throughout their development and nurturing, exemplified by ego ideals and formative identifications.

Evolutionary perspectives on human coupling, reproduction and [[reproduction strategies]], and [[social learning theory]] provide further views of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;''Sexual Strategies Theory: An Evolutionary Perspective on Human Mating'' by David M. Buss and David P. Schmitt&lt;/ref&gt; Socio-cultural aspects of sexuality include historical developments and religious beliefs.

==Development==
===Nature versus nurture===
{{see also|Nature versus nurture}}

Certain characteristics may be innate in humans; these characteristics may be modified by the physical and social environment in which people interact.&lt;ref&gt;Csongradi, C. (n.d.). A new look at an old debate. access excellence. retrieved 12 November 2011, from www.accessexcellence.org/LC/SER/BE/whata.php&lt;/ref&gt; Human sexuality is driven by genetics and [[mental activity]].  The sexual drive affects the development of [[identity (social science)|personal identity]] and social activities.&lt;ref name="Boccadoro L. 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze and Guattari (1972) Anti-Oedipus pp. 322, 114–5&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's [[normative]], social, cultural, educational, and environmental characteristics moderate the sexual drive.&lt;ref name="Boccadoro L. 2008"&gt;Boccadoro L., Carulli S., (2008) Il posto dell'amore negato.  (The place of the denied love. Sexuality and secret psychopathologies – Abstract). Tecnoprint Editrice, Ancona. {{ISBN|978-88-95554-03-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two well-known schools in psychology took opposing positions in the nature-versus-nurture debate: the [[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytic]] school led by [[Sigmund Freud]] and the [[Behaviorist]] school which traces its origins to [[John Locke]].

Freud believed sexual drives are instinctive. He was a firm supporter of the nature argument; he said there are a large number of instincts but they are reduced into two broad groups: [[Eros]] (the life instinct), which comprises the self-preserving and erotic instincts, and [[Thanatos]] (the death instinct), which comprises instincts invoking aggression, self-destruction, and cruelty.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/freud/ |title=Freud, Sigmund [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93; |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave sexual drives a centrality in human life, actions, and behaviors that had not been accepted before his proposal. His instinct theory said humans are driven from birth by the desire to acquire and enhance bodily pleasures, thus supporting the nature debate. Freud redefined the term ''sexuality'' to make it cover any form of pleasure that can be derived from the human body.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt; He also said pleasure lowers tension while displeasure raises it, influencing the sexual drive in humans. His developmentalist perspective was governed by inner forces, especially biological drives and maturation, and his view that humans are biologically inclined to seek sexual gratification demonstrates the nature side of the debate.&lt;ref name="Crain, W. C. 1980"/&gt;
The nurture debate traces back to [[John Locke]] and his theory of the mind as a "[[tabula rasa]]" or blank slate. Later, [[behaviorists]] would apply this notion in support of the idea that the environment is where one develops one's sexual drives.&lt;ref name="Crain, W. C. 1980"&gt;Crain, W. C. (1980).

===Gender differences===
{{see also|Sex differences in psychology#Sexual behavior}}

Psychological theories exist regarding the development and expression of gender differences in human sexuality. A number of them, including [[neo-analytic]] theories, [[sociobiological]] theories, [[social learning theory]], [[social role theory]], and [[script theory]], agree in predicting that men should be more approving of casual sex (sex happening outside a stable, committed relationship such as [[marriage]]) and should also be more [[promiscuous]] (have a higher number of sexual partners) than women. These theories are mostly consistent with observed differences in males' and females' attitudes toward casual sex before marriage in the United States; other aspects of human sexuality, such as sexual satisfaction, incidence of [[oral sex]], and attitudes toward [[homosexuality]] and [[masturbation]], show little to no observed difference between males and females. Observed gender differences regarding the number of sexual partners are modest, with males tending to have slightly more than females.&lt;ref name="Oliver &amp; Hyde"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Mary Beth |last2=Hyde |first2=Janet S. |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor1-first=Roy F. |title=Social Psychology and Human Sexuality: Essential Readings |date=2001 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-1-84-169019-3 |pages=29–43 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=2qsKNaqIsuUC&amp;pg=PA29 |language=en |chapter=Gender Differences in Sexuality: A Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical anatomy and reproduction===
Males and females are anatomically similar; this extends to some degree to the [[development of the reproductive system]]. As adults, they have different reproductive mechanisms that enable them to perform sexual acts and to reproduce. Men and women react to sexual stimuli in a similar fashion with minor differences. Women have a monthly reproductive cycle, whereas the male sperm production cycle is more continuous.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

====Brain====
The [[hypothalamus]] is the most important part of the brain for sexual functioning. This is a small area at the base of the brain consisting of several groups of nerve cell bodies that receives input from the limbic system. Studies have shown that within lab animals, destruction of certain areas of the hypothalamus causes the elimination of sexual behavior.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The hypothalamus is important because of its relationship to the [[pituitary gland]], which lies beneath it. The pituitary gland secretes hormones that are produced in the hypothalamus and itself. The four important sexual hormones are [[oxytocin]], [[prolactin]], [[follicle-stimulating hormone]], and [[luteinizing hormone]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} Oxytocin, sometimes referred to as the "love hormone,"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} is released in both sexes during sexual intercourse when an [[orgasm]] is achieved.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Oxytocin has been suggested as critical to the thoughts and behaviors required to maintain close relationships.&lt;ref name="Sigelman452"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Sigelman |first1=Carol |last2= Rider |first2=Elizabeth | year = 2011 | title =Life-Span Human Development| location = Boston, MA, USA | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | page = 452 |isbn = 1111342733| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=8smBuRecmDsC&amp;pg=PT480 | access-date = 7 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hornstein"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Hornstein |first1=Theresa |last2=Schwerin |first2=Jeri | year = 2012 | title = Biology of Women | location = Boston, MA, USA | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | page = 205 | isbn = 1285401026| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=ibgKAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA205 | accessdate = 7 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=February 2016}} The hormone is also released in women when they give birth or are breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book | author = Smith, Linda J. | year = 2010 | title = Impact of Birthing Practices on Breastfeeding | location = Burlington, MA, USA | publisher = [[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|Jones &amp; Bartlett]] | page = 158 | isbn = 0763763748 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=vUncnT6o4k4C&amp;pg=PA158 | access-date = 20 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both prolactin&lt;!--RIGHT?--&gt; and oxytocin stimulate milk production in women.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is responsible for ovulation in women, which acts by triggering egg maturity; in men it stimulates sperm production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Hyde|first1=Janet|authorlink1=Janet Shibley Hyde|last2=DeLamater|first2=John|authorlink2=John DeLamater| last3=Byers|first3=Sandra | year = 2013 | title=Understanding Human Sexuality | edition = 5th Canadian | location = Whitby, ON, CAN | publisher = McGraw-Hill Ryerson | isbn=9780070329720 | pages=100, 102ff | url =  | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers ovulation, which is the release of a mature egg.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

====Male anatomy and reproductive system====
{{main|Human male reproductive system}}

Males also have both internal and external genitalia that are responsible for procreation and sexual intercourse. Production of spermatozoa (sperm) is also cyclic, but unlike the female ovulation cycle, the sperm production cycle is constantly producing millions of sperm daily.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

&lt;!--If removing clarifying specification of "uncircumcised", please explain why it is not helpful. Please allow tag for citation of the label content of this editor selfie to remain until the discussion in Talk has ended. (If Doc or someone check's it, against what source? That is what student readers need.) To remove preemptively is disrespectful, and begs the outcome of the discussion.--&gt;

The male genitalia are the penis and the scrotum. The penis provides a passageway for sperm and urine. An average-sized flaccid penis is about {{convert|3+3/4|inch|cm|abbr=out}} in length and {{convert|1+1/5|in|cm|abbr=out}} in diameter. When erect, the average penis is between {{convert|4+1/2|in|cm|abbr=out}} to {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=out}} in length and {{convert|1+1/2|in|cm|abbr=out}} in diameter. The penis's internal structures consist of the [[shaft (penis)|shaft]], [[glans]], and the [[root]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The shaft of the penis consists of three cylindrical bodies of spongy tissue filled with blood vessels along its length. Two of these bodies lie side-by-side in the upper portion of the penis called corpora cavernosa. The third, called the [[corpus spongiosum]], is a tube that lies centrally beneath the others and expands at the end to form the tip of the penis (glans).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innerbody.com/image/repmov.html |title=Male Reproductive System - Explore Anatomy with Detailed Pictures |publisher=Innerbody.com |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The raised rim at the border of the shaft and glans is called the corona. The urethra runs through the shaft, providing an exit for sperm and urine. The root consists of the expanded ends of the cavernous bodies, which fan out to form the crura and attach to the pubic bone and the expanded end of the spongy body (bulb). The root is surrounded by two muscles; the [[bulbocavernosus muscle]] and the [[ischiocavernosus muscle]], which aid urination and ejaculation. The penis has a [[foreskin]] that typically covers the glans; this is sometimes removed by [[circumcision]] for medical, religious or cultural reasons.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} In the scrotum, the testicles are held away from the body, one possible reason for this is so sperm can be produced in an environment slightly lower than normal body temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drew|first1=Liam|title=The Scrotum Is Nuts|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/07/are_testicles_external_for_cooling_galloping_display_or_something_else.1.html|accessdate=3 July 2015|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']]|date=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madaras|first1=Lynda Madaras with Area|title=The what's happening to my body? book for boys|date=2008|publisher=Newmarket|location=New York|isbn=9781557047656|edition=Rev.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zC1g5gdJc_kC&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male internal reproductive structures are the testicles, the duct system, the prostate and seminal vesicles, and the [[bulbourethral gland|Cowper's gland]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The testicles are the male gonads where sperm and male hormones are produced. Millions of sperm are produced daily in several hundred seminiferous tubules. Cells called the [[Leydig cell]]s lie between the tubules; these produce hormones called androgens; these consist of [[testosterone]] and [[inhibin]]. The testicles are held by the spermatic cord, which is a tubelike structure containing blood vessels, nerves, the vas deferens, and a muscle that helps to raise and lower the testicles in response to temperature changes and sexual arousal, in which the testicles are drawn closer to the body.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

Sperm are transported through a four-part duct system. The first part of this system is the [[epididymis]]. The testicles converge to form the [[seminiferous tubules]], coiled tubes at the top and back of each testicle. The second part of the duct system is the [[vas deferens]], a muscular tube that begins at the lower end of the epididymis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The vas deferens passes upward along the side of the testicles to become part of the spermatic cord.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The expanded end is the ampulla, which stores sperm before ejaculation. The third part of the duct system is the ejaculatory ducts, which are {{convert|1|in|cm|abbr=out|adj=on}}-long paired tubes that pass through the prostate gland, where semen is produced.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The prostate gland is a solid, chestnut-shaped organ that surrounds the first part of the urethra, which carries urine and semen.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Similar to the female G-spot, the prostate provides sexual stimulation and can lead to [[orgasm]] through [[anal sex]].&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2012|pages=133–135|accessdate = March 31, 2016| isbn = 0618755713|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prostate gland and the seminal vesicles produce seminal fluid that is mixed with sperm to create semen.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The prostate gland lies under the bladder and in front of the rectum. It consists of two main zones: the inner zone that produces secretions to keep the lining of the male urethra moist and the outer zone that produces seminal fluids to facilitate the passage of semen.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The seminal vesicles secrete fructose for sperm activation and mobilization, prostaglandins to cause uterine contractions that aid movement through the uterus, and bases that help neutralize the acidity of the vagina. The Cowper's glands, or bulbourethral glands, are two pea sized structures beneath the prostate.

====Female anatomy and reproductive system====
{{Main|Human female reproductive system}}

=====External female anatomy=====
[[File:Vulva labeled english.jpg|thumb|upright|External female genitals (depilated).]]

The mons veneris, also known as the [[Mons pubis|Mound of Venus]], is a soft layer of fatty tissue overlaying the pubic bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hyde |last2=DeLamater |last3=Byers|title=Understanding Human Sexuality 5th Canadian ed.|isbn=9780070329720|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following puberty, this area grows in size. It has many nerve endings and is sensitive to stimulation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The labia minora and labia majora are collectively known as the lips. The labia majora are two elongated folds of skin extending from the mons to the perineum. Its outer surface becomes covered with hair after puberty. In between the labia majora are the labia minora, two hairless folds of skin that meet above the clitoris to form the clitoral hood, which is highly sensitive to touch. The labia minora become engorged with blood during sexual stimulation, causing them to swell and turn red.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The labia minora are composed of connective tissues that are richly supplied with blood vessels which cause the pinkish appearance. Near the anus, the labia minora merge with the labia majora.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innerbody.com/image/repfov.html |title=Female Reproductive System - Anatomy Pictures and Information |publisher=Innerbody.com |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a sexually unstimulated state, the labia minora protects the vaginal and urethral opening by covering them.&lt;ref&gt;''Human Reproductive Biology'' by Mark M. Jones (2012), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; At the base of the labia minora are the [[Bartholin's glands]], which add a few drops of an alkaline fluid to the vagina via ducts; this fluid helps to counteract the acidity of the outer vagina since sperm cannot live in an acidic environment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The clitoris is developed from the same embryonic tissue as the penis; it or its [[Clitoral glans|glans]] alone consists of as many (or more in some cases) nerve endings as the human penis or glans penis, making it extremely sensitive to touch.&lt;ref name="Francoeur"&gt;{{cite book |last=Francoeur |first=Robert T. |year=2000 |title=The Complete Dictionary of Sexology |publisher=The Continuum Publishing Company |page=180 |isbn=0-8264-0672-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite book | title =Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2009 | page = 118 | accessdate =23 June 2012 | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=5f8mQx7ULs4C |}} |isbn =978-0-495-60274-3 | first = Janell L. | last = Carroll}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Can't feel"&gt;{{cite web | title = I'm a woman who cannot feel pleasurable sensations during intercourse | publisher = [[Go Ask Alice!]] | date = 8 October 2004| accessdate = 13 September 2012|url=http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/im-woman-who-cannot-feel-pleasurable-sensations-during-intercourse |archivedate= 7 January 2011|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110107184029/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/3229.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clitoral glans, which is a small, elongated erectile structure, has only one known function—sexual sensations.

The vaginal opening and the urethral opening are only visible when the labia minora are parted. These opening have many nerve endings that make them sensitive to touch. They are surrounded by a ring of sphincter muscles called the [[bulbocavernosus muscle]]. Underneath this muscle and on opposite sides of the vaginal opening are the vestibular bulbs, which help the vagina grip the penis by swelling with blood during arousal. Within the vaginal opening is the [[hymen]], a thin membrane that partially covers the opening in many [[Virginity|virgins]]. Rupture of the hymen has been historically considered the loss of  one's virginity, though by modern standards, loss of virginity is considered to be the first sexual intercourse. The hymen can be ruptured by activities other than sexual intercourse. The urethral opening connects to the bladder with the urethra; it expels urine from the bladder. This is located below the clitoris and above the vaginal opening.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The [[breast]]s are external organs used for sexual pleasure in some cultures. Western culture is one of the few in which they are considered erotic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The breasts are the subcutaneous tissues on the front thorax of the female body.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt; Breasts are modified sweat glands made up of fibrous tissues and fat that provide support and contain nerves, blood vessels and lymphatic vessels.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt; Their purpose is to provide milk to a developing infant. Breasts develop during puberty in response to an increase in estrogen. Each adult breast consists of 15 to 20 milk-producing [[mammary glands]], irregularly shaped lobes that include [[alveolar gland]]s and a lactiferous duct leading to the nipple. The lobes are separated by dense connective tissues that support the glands and attach them to the tissues on the underlying pectoral muscles.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt; Other connective tissue, which forms dense strands called suspensory ligaments, extends inward from the skin of the breast to the pectoral tissue to support the weight of the breast.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt; Heredity and the quantity of fatty tissue determine the size of the breasts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

=====Internal female anatomy=====
{{main|Female reproductive system}}
[[File:Female reproductive system lateral.png|thumb|The female reproductive system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luckymojo.com/faqs/altsex/vulva.html |title=The Sexual Anatomy Of Women: Vulva and Vagina |publisher=Luckymojo.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The female internal reproductive organs are the [[vagina]], [[uterus]], [[Fallopian tube]]s, and [[ovary|ovaries]]. The vagina is a sheath-like canal that extends from the vulva to the cervix. It receives the penis during intercourse and serves as a depository for sperm. The vagina is also the [[birth canal]]; it can expand to {{convert|10|cm|inch|abbr=on}} during labor and delivery. The vagina is located between the [[bladder]] and the [[rectum]]. The vagina is normally collapsed, but during [[sexual arousal]] it opens, lengthens, and produces lubrication to allow the insertion of the penis. The vagina has three layered walls; it is a self-cleaning organ with natural  bacteria that suppress the production of yeast.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The [[G-spot]], named after the [[Ernst Gräfenberg]] who first reported it in 1950, may be located in the front wall of the vagina and may cause orgasms. This area may vary in size and location between women; in some it may be absent. Various researchers dispute its structure or existence, or regard it as an extension of the clitoris.&lt;ref name=Hines&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hines T |date=August 2001 |title=The G-Spot: A modern gynecologic myth |journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol |volume=185 |issue=2 |pages=359–62 | doi=10.1067/mob.2001.115995  |pmid=11518892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balon, Segraves"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Richard |last1=Balon |first2=Robert Taylor |last2=Segraves|title=Clinical Manual of Sexual Disorders |publisher= [[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Pub]]|year=2009|accessdate=24 January 2014|page=258|isbn=1585629057|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=YuP3Hb0TMLQC |}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kilchevsky"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is the Female G-Spot Truly a Distinct Anatomic Entity?|journal=[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]|volume= 9|date=January 2012 |pmid=22240236|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02623.x|laysummary=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/19/g-spot-does-not-exist_n_1215822.html|laysource=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|laydate=19 January 2012 |last1=Kilchevsky |first1=A |last2=Vardi |first2=Y |last3=Lowenstein |first3=L |last4=Gruenwald |first4=I |issue=3|pages=719–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uterus or womb is a hollow, muscular organ where a fertilized egg (ovum) will implant itself and grow into a fetus.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The uterus lies in the pelvic cavity between the bladder and the [[bowel]], and above the vagina. It is usually positioned in a 90-degree angle tilting forward, although in about 20% of women it tilts backwards.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt; The uterus has three layers; the innermost layer is the [[endometrium]], where the egg is implanted. During ovulation, this thickens for implantation. If implantation does not occur, it is sloughed off during menstruation. The cervix is the narrow end of the uterus. The broad part of the uterus is the [[fundus (uterus)|fundus]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

During [[ovulation]], the ovum travels down the Fallopian tubes to the uterus. These extend about {{convert|4|inch|cm|spell=in}} from both sides of the uterus. Finger-like projections at the ends of the tubes brush the ovaries and receive the ovum once it is released. The ovum then travels for three to four days to the uterus.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} After sexual intercourse, sperm swim up this funnel from the uterus. The lining of the tube and its secretions sustain the egg and the sperm, encouraging [[fertilization]] and nourishing the ovum until it reaches the uterus. If the ovum divides after fertilization, [[identical twins]] are produced. If separate eggs are fertilized by different sperm, the mother gives birth to non-identical or [[fraternal twins]].&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt;

The ovaries are the female gonads; they develop from the same embryonic tissue as the [[testicles]]. The ovaries are suspended by ligaments and are the source where ova are stored and developed before ovulation. The ovaries also produce female hormones [[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]]. Within the ovaries, each ovum is surrounded by other cells and contained within a capsule called a primary follicle. At puberty, one or more of these follicles are stimulated to mature on a monthly basis. Once matured, these are called [[Graafian follicles]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The female reproductive system does not produce the ova; about 60,000 ova are present at birth, only  400 of which will mature during the woman's lifetime.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt;

Ovulation is based on a monthly cycle; the 14th day is the most fertile. On days one to four, menstruation and production of estrogen and progesterone decreases, and the endometrium starts thinning. The endometrium is sloughed off for the next three to six days. Once menstruation ends, the cycle begins again with an FSH surge from the pituitary gland. Days five to thirteen are known as the pre-ovulatory stage. During this stage, the pituitary gland secretes [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH). A negative feedback loop is enacted when estrogen is secreted to inhibit the release of FSH. Estrogen thickens the endometrium of the uterus. A surge of [[Luteinizing Hormone]] (LH) triggers ovulation. On day 14, the LH surge causes a Graafian follicle to surface the ovary. The follicle ruptures and the ripe ovum is expelled into the abdominal cavity. The fallopian tubes pick up the ovum with the [[Fimbriae of uterine tube|fimbria]]. The cervical mucus changes to aid the movement of sperm. On days 15 to 28—the post-ovulatory stage, the Graafian follicle—now called the [[corpus luteum]]—secretes estrogen. Production of progesterone increases, inhibiting LH release. The endometrium thickens to prepare for implantation, and the ovum travels down the Fallopian tubes to the uterus. If the ovum is not fertilized and does not implant, menstruation begins.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

===Sexual response cycle===

The sexual response cycle is a model that describes the physiological responses that occur during sexual activity. This model was created by [[William Masters]] and [[Virginia E. Johnson|Virginia Johnson]]. According to Masters and Johnson, the human sexual response cycle consists of four phases; excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution, also called the EPOR model. During the excitement phase of the EPOR model, one attains the intrinsic motivation to have sex. The plateau phase is the precursor to orgasm, which may be mostly biological for men and mostly psychological for women. Orgasm is the release of tension, and the resolution period is the unaroused state before the cycle begins again.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The male sexual response cycle starts in the excitement phase; two centers in the spine are responsible for erections. Vasoconstriction in the penis begins, the heart rate increases, the scrotum thickens, the spermatic cord shortens, and the testicles become engorged with blood. In the plateau phase, the penis increases in diameter, the testicles become more engorged, and the Cowper's glands secrete pre-seminal fluid. The orgasm phase, during which rhythmic contractions occur every 0.8 seconds{{Verify source|date=May 2012}}, consists of two phases; the emission phase, in which contractions of the vas deferens, prostate, and seminal vesicles encourage ejaculation, which is the second phase of orgasm. Ejaculation is called the expulsion phase; it cannot be reached without an orgasm. In the resolution phase, the male is now in an unaroused state consisting of a [[Refractory period (sex)|refactory (rest) period]] before the cycle can begin. This rest period may increase with age.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The female sexual response begins with the excitement phase, which can last from several minutes to several hours. Characteristics of this phase include increased heart and respiratory rate, and an elevation of blood pressure. Flushed skin or blotches of redness may occur on the chest and back; breasts increase slightly in size and nipples may become hardened and erect. The onset of [[vasocongestion]] results in swelling of the clitoris, labia minora, and vagina.  The muscle that surrounds the vaginal opening tightens and the uterus elevates and grows in size. The vaginal walls begin to produce a lubricating liquid. The second phase, called the plateau phase, is characterized primarily by the intensification of the changes begun during the excitement phase. The plateau phase extends to the brink of orgasm, which initiates the resolution stage; the reversal of the changes begun during the excitement phase. During the orgasm stage the heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and breathing rates peak. The pelvic muscle near the vagina, the anal sphincter, and the uterus contract. Muscle contractions in the vaginal area create a high level of pleasure, though all orgasms are centered in the clitoris.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Intimacy |first=Sinclair |url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/sexual-response-dictionary1.htm |title=Discovery Health "Sexual Response" |publisher=Health.howstuffworks.com |date=25 April 2005 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proplusmedical.com/pages.html?pages_id=8 |title=Female Sexual Response Cycle |publisher=Proplusmedical.com |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koedt70"&gt;{{cite web |last = Koedt |first = Anne |title = The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |publisher = Chicago Women's Liberation Union |year = 1970 |url = http://www.cwluherstory.org/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm.html |accessdate = 2010-11-18 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160819232224/http://www.cwluherstory.org/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm.html |archivedate = 19 August 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of the neurobiological factors of human sexuality===
From [[rodent]] to human, the corticalization of the brain induces several changes in the control of sexual behavior, including lordosis behavior. These changes induce a "difference between the stereotyped sexual behaviors in non-human mammals and the astounding variety of human sexual behaviors".&lt;ref name="agmo"/&gt;
[[File:Evolution of the biological factors of sexual behavior.png|thumb|600px|left|Evolution of the main neurobiological factors that control the sexual behavior of mammals.&lt;ref name="agmo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nei2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wunsch2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wunsch2017"/&gt;]] {{clr}}

Sexual reflexes, such as the motor reflex of lordosis, become secondary. In particular, lordosis behavior, which is a motor reflex complex and essential to carry out [[copulation]] in non-primate mammals ([[rodent]]s, [[Canidae|canines]], [[bovid]]s ...), is apparently no longer functional in women. Sexual stimuli on women do not trigger any more neither immobilization nor the reflex position of lordosis. On the level of olfactory systems, the [[vomeronasal organ]] is altered in [[hominid]]s&lt;ref name="zhang"&gt;Zhang J., Webb D. M. (2003) Evolutionary deterioration of the vomeronasal [[pheromone]] transduction pathway in catarrhine primates, ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', 100(14):8337-8341.&lt;/ref&gt; and 90% of the pheromone [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[gene]]s become [[pseudogene]]s in humans.&lt;ref name="nei2008"&gt;Nei M., Niimura Y., Nozawa M.

Humans can have sex anytime during the year and [[Menstrual cycle|hormonal cycles]]. On the contrary, the importance of [[Reward system|rewards / reinforcements]] and [[cognition]] became major. Especially in humans, the extensive development of the [[neocortex]] allows the emergence of [[culture]], which has a major influence on behavior.&lt;ref name="gagnon2005"&gt;Gagnon J.

[[File:Learning of the sexual motivation in humans.png|thumb|600px|left|Multifactorial dynamics of human sexuality&lt;ref name="wunsch2014"/&gt;]] {{clr}}
In human beings, sexuality is multifactorial, with several factors that interact (genes, hormones, conditioning, sexual preferences, emotions, cognitive processes, cultural context). The relative importance of each of these factors is dependent both on individual physiological characteristics, personal experience and aspects of the sociocultural environment.&lt;ref name="wunsch2017"/&gt;

===Sexual dysfunction and sexual problems===
{{main|Sexual dysfunction}}
Sexual disorders, according to the DSM-IV-TR, are disturbances in sexual desire and psycho-physiological changes that characterize the sexual response cycle and cause marked distress, and interpersonal difficulty. The sexual dysfunctions is a result of physical or psychological disorders. The physical causes include, hormonal imbalance, diabetes, heart disease and more. The psychological causes includes but are not limited to, stress, anxiety, and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Female Sexual Dysfunction|url=http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/sexual-dysfunction-women|website=www.webmd.com|publisher=webmd.com|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual dysfunction affects men and women. There are four major categories of sexual problems for women: desire disorders, arousal disorders, orgasmic disorders, and sexual pain disorders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The sexual desire disorder occurs when an individual lacks the sexual desire because of hormonal changes, depression, and pregnancy.The arousal disorder is a female sexual dysfunction. Arousal disorder means lack of vaginal lubrication. In addition, blood flow problems may affect arousal disorder. Lack of orgasm, also known as, anorgasmia is another sexual dysfunction in women. The anorgasmia occurs in women with psychological disorders such as guilt and anxiety that was caused by sexual assault. The last sexual disorder is the painful intercourse. The sexual disorder can be result of pelvic mass, scar tissue, sexually transmitted disease and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Female Sexual Dysfunction|url=http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/sexual-dysfunction-women?page=2|website=www.webmd.com|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are also three common sexual disorders for men including, sexual desire, ejaculation disorder, and erectile dysfunction.  The lack of sexual desire in men is because of loss of libido, low testosterone. There are also psychological factors such as anxiety, and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Male Sexual Problems|url=http://www.webmd.com/men/guide/mental-health-male-sexual-problems?page=2|website=Webmd.com|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ejaculation disorder has three types, Retrograde ejaculation, retarded ejaculation, premature ejaculation. The erectile dysfunction is a disability to have and maintain an erection during intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Our Bodies, Ourselves|date=2011|publisher=BOSTON WOMEN'S HEALTH BOOK COLLECTIVE|isbn=978-0-7432-5611-7|edition=35th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gender identity]] is a person's sense of self-identification as female, male, both, neither, or somewhere in between. The social construction of gender has been discussed by many scholars, including [[Judith Butler]]. More recent research has focused upon the influence of feminist theory and courtship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = D.M. | year = 2002 | title = Human mating strategies | url = | journal = Samdunfsokonemen | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 48–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, W.

Sexual behavior and intimate relationships are strongly influenced by a person's sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Coon, D. 2007"&gt;Coon, D., &amp; Mitterer, J. O. (2007). Introduction to psychology: gateways to mind and behavior (11th ed.). Australia: [[Thomson/Wadsworth]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual orientation is an enduring pattern of [[Romance (love)|romantic]] or [[Sexual attraction|sexual]] attraction (or a combination of these) to persons of the opposite sex, same sex, or both sexes.&lt;ref name="Coon, D. 2007"/&gt; Heterosexual people are romantically/sexually attracted to the members of the opposite sex, gay and lesbian people are romantically/sexually attracted to people of the same sex, and those who are bisexual are romantically/sexually attracted to both sexes.&lt;ref name="AmPsycholAssn-whatis"/&gt;

Before the [[High Middle Ages]], homosexual acts appear to have been ignored or tolerated by the Christian church.&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_mental_health.html |title=Homosexuality and Mental Health |publisher=Psychology.ucdavis.edu |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 12th century, hostility toward homosexuality began to spread throughout religious and secular institutions. By the end of the 19th century, it was viewed as a pathology.&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"/&gt; [[Havelock Ellis]] and Sigmund Freud adopted more accepting stances; Ellis said homosexuality was inborn and therefore not immoral, not a disease, and that many homosexuals made significant contributions to society.&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"/&gt; Freud wrote that all human beings as capable of becoming either heterosexual or homosexual; neither orientation was assumed to be innate.&lt;ref name="King, B. 2009"&gt;{{cite book | author = King, Bruce M. | year = 2009 | title = Human Sexuality Today | edition = 6th | pages =  | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA | publisher = Pearson Education | isbn =  | url =  | access-date =  | quote = }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} According to Freud, a person's orientation depended on the resolution of the Oedipus complex. He said male homosexuality resulted when a young boy had an authoritarian, rejecting mother and turned to his father for love and affection, and later to men in general. He said female homosexuality developed when a girl loved her mother and identified with her father, and became fixated at that stage.&lt;ref name="King, B. 2009"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

Freud and Ellis said homosexuality resulted from reversed gender roles. In the early 21st century, this view is reinforced by the media's portrayal of male homosexuals as effeminate and female homosexuals as masculine.&lt;ref name="King, B. 2009"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} A person's conformity or non-conformity to gender stereotypes does not always predict sexual orientation. Society believes that if a man is masculine he is heterosexual, and if a man is feminine he is homosexual. There is no strong evidence that a homosexual or bisexual orientation must be associated with atypical gender roles. By the early 21st century, homosexuality was no longer considered to be a pathology. Theories have linked many factors, including genetic, anatomical, birth order, and hormones in the prenatal environment, to homosexuality.&lt;ref name="King, B. 2009"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

Other than the need to procreate, there are many other reasons people have sex. According to one study conducted on college students (Meston &amp; Buss, 2007), the four main reasons for sexual activities are; physical attraction, as a means to an end, to increase emotional connection, and to alleviate insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychology |year=2011 |publisher=Worth Publishers |page=336|author1=Daniel L.

==Sexuality and age==

===Child sexuality===
{{Main|Child sexuality}}
In the past{{when|date=June 2015}}, children were often assumed not to have sexuality until later development. Sigmund Freud was one of the first researchers to take child sexuality seriously. His ideas, such as psychosexual development and the Oedipus conflict, have been much debated but acknowledging the existence of child sexuality was an important development.&lt;ref name="Santrock, J.W. 2008"&gt;Santrock, J.W. (2008). A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development (4thed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud gave sexual drives an importance and centrality in human life, actions, and behavior; he said sexual drives exist and can be discerned in children from birth. He explains this in his theory of [[infantile sexuality]], and says sexual energy ([[libido]]) is the most important motivating force in adult life. Freud wrote about the importance of interpersonal relationships to one's sexual and emotional development. From birth, the mother's connection to the infant affects the infant's later capacity for pleasure and [[attachment theory|attachment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bretherton | first1 = Inge | year = 1992 | title = The origins of attachment theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth | url = http://cmapspublic2.ihmc.us/rid=1LQX400NM-RBVKH9-1KL6/the%20origins%20of%20attachment%20theory%20john%20bowlby%20and%20mary%20ainsworth.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 28 | issue = 5| page = 759 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Freud described two currents of emotional life; an affectionate current, including our bonds with the important people in our lives; and a sensual current, including our wish to gratify sexual impulses. During adolescence, a young person tries to integrate these two emotional currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alcorn|first1=Jean-Michel Quinodoz; translated by David|title=Reading Freud: a chronological exploration of Freud's writings|date=2005|isbn=9781317710509|page=165|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A8hdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT165|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Kinsey]] also examined child sexuality in his [[Kinsey Reports]]. Children are naturally curious about their bodies and sexual functions. For example, they wonder where babies come from, they notice the differences between males and females, and many engage in [[genital play]], which is often mistaken for masturbation. Child sex play, also known as [[playing doctor]], includes exhibiting or inspecting the genitals. Many children take part in some sex play, typically with siblings or friends.&lt;ref name="Santrock, J.W. 2008"/&gt; Sex play with others usually decreases as children grow, but they may later possess romantic interest in their peers. Curiosity levels remain high during these years, but the main surge in sexual interest occurs in adolescence.&lt;ref name="Santrock, J.W. 2008"/&gt;

===Sexuality in late adulthood===
{{Main|Sexuality in older age}}
Adult sexuality originates in childhood. However, like many other human capacities, sexuality is not fixed, but matures and develops. A common stereotype associated with old people is that they tend to lose interest and the ability to engage in sexual acts once they reach late adulthood. This misconception is reinforced by Western popular culture, which often ridicules older adults who try to engage in sexual activities. Age does not necessarily change the need or desire to be sexually expressive or active. A couple in a long-term relationship may find that the frequency of their sexual activity decreases over time and the type of sexual expression may change, but many couples experience increased intimacy and love.&lt;ref name=jrank&gt;[http://family.jrank.org/pages/1532/Sexuality-in-Adulthood-Aging.html Sexuality in Adulthood - Aging], JRank Marriage and Family Encyclopedia, Net Industries&lt;/ref&gt;

Human sexuality can be understood as part of the social life of humans, which is governed by implied rules of behavior and the status quo. This narrows the view to groups within a society.&lt;ref name="Rathus, Spencer A. 2007"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The socio-cultural context of society, including the effects of politics and the mass media, influences and forms social norms. Before the early 21st century, people fought for their civil rights. The civil rights movements helped to bring about massive changes in social norms; examples include the sexual revolution and the rise of feminism.&lt;ref name=Escoffier2003&gt;{{cite book|editor=Escoffier, Jeffrey |title=Sexual Revolution |publisher=Running Press |year=2003 |isbn=1-56025-525-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedan&gt;{{cite news|title=Betty Friedan, Who Ignited Cause in 'Feminine Mystique,' Dies at 85 |url=http://www-nc.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/national/05friedan.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=5 February 2006 |accessdate=12 October 2009}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The link between constructed sexual meanings and racial ideologies has been studied. Sexual meanings are constructed to maintain racial-ethnic-national boundaries by denigration of "others" and regulation of sexual behavior within the group. According to Joane Nagel, "both adherence to and deviation from such approved behaviors, define and reinforce racial, ethnic, and nationalist regimes".&lt;ref name=Nagel&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nagel, Joane |date=August 2000 |title=Ethnicity and Sexuality |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=26 |pp=107–133 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nagel2&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nagel, Joane |year=2001 |title=Racial, Ethnic, and National Boundaries: Sexual Intersections and Symbolic Interactions |journal=Symbolic Interaction |volume=24 | issue = 2  |pp=123–139 |doi=10.1525/si.2001.24.2.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars also study the ways in which [[colonialism]] has effected sexuality today and argue that due to [[racism]] and [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] it has been dramatically changed from the way it had previously been understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rojas|first1=Maythee|title=Women of Color and Feminism|date=2009|publisher=Seal Press|isbn=978-1-58005-272-6|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3KBFhDytERkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-11-30|ref=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KBFhDytERkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes to sexuality are argued to be largely effected by the enforcement of the [[gender binary]] and [[heteropatriarchy]] as tools of colonization on colonized communities as seen in nations such as [[Hijra (South Asia)|India]], [[fa'afafine|Samoa]], and the [[First Nations]] in the Americas, resulting in the deaths and erasure of non-western genders and sexualities. In the United States people of color face the effects of colonialism in different ways with stereotypes such as the Mammy, and Jezabel for Black women; [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States|lotus blossom, and dragon lady]] for Asian women; and the "spicy" Latina.&lt;ref name="Mammy Jezebel and Sistahs on Racism.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yarbrough|first1=Marilyn|last2=Bennet|first2=Crystal|title=Mammy Jezebel and Sistahs|url=http://racism.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1277:aawomen01a&amp;catid=72&amp;Itemid=215|website=Race, Racism and the Law!|publisher=racism.org|accessdate=2015-11-30|ref=http://racism.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1277:aawomen01a&amp;catid=72&amp;Itemid=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age and manner in which children are informed of issues of sexuality is a matter of sex education. The school systems in almost all developed countries have some form of sex education, but the nature of the issues covered varies widely. In some countries, such as Australia and much of Europe, age-appropriate sex education often begins in pre-school, whereas other countries leave sex education to the pre-teenage and teenage years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Think Sex |publisher=TheAge.com.au |accessdate=11 October 2009|url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/education-news/think-sex/2006/05/28/1148754861223.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex education covers a range of topics, including the physical, mental, and social aspects of sexual behavior. Geographic location also plays a role in society's opinion of the appropriate age for children to learn about sexuality. According to ''TIME'' magazine and CNN,{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}} 74% of teenagers in the United States reported that their major sources of sexual information were their peers and the media, compared to 10% who named their parents or a sex education course.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

===Religious sexual morality===
{{Main|Religion and sexuality}}
In some religions, sexual behavior is regarded as primarily spiritual. In others it is treated as primarily physical. Some hold that sexual behavior is only spiritual within certain kinds of relationships, when used for specific purposes, or when incorporated into religious ritual. In some religions there are no distinctions between the physical and the spiritual, whereas some religions view human sexuality as a way of completing the gap that exists between the spiritual and the physical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religion and Sexuality|url=http://www.iwgonline.org/sexuality/|publisher=Interfaith Working Group|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religious conservatives, especially those of [[Abrahamic religions]] and [[Christianity]] in particular, tend to view sexuality in terms of behavior (''i.e.'' homosexuality or heterosexuality is what someone does) and certain sexualities such as [[bisexuality]] tend to be ignored as a result of this.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} These conservatives tend to promote [[celibacy]] for gay people, and may also tend to believe that sexuality can be changed through [[conversion therapy]]&lt;ref name=Tolerance111&gt;{{cite web | title= Two Definitions and Six Interpretations | url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom6beli.htm | website=religioustolerance.org | accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[prayer]] to become an [[ex-gay]]. They may also see homosexuality as a form of mental illness, something that ought to be criminalised, an immoral abomination, caused by ineffective parenting, and view [[same-sex marriage]] as a threat to society.&lt;ref name=Tolerance222&gt;{{cite web|title=Subdividing Two Extreme Belief Systems About Homosexuality Into Six Discrete Viewpoints | url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom7beli.htm|website=religioustolerance.org | accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, most religious liberals define sexuality-related labels in terms of [[sexual attraction]] and self-identification.&lt;ref name=Tolerance111 /&gt; They may also view same-sex activity as morally neutral and as legally acceptable as opposite-sex activity, unrelated to mental illness, genetically or environmentally caused (but not as the result of bad parenting), and fixed. They also tend to be more in favor of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name=Tolerance222 /&gt;

====Attitude by religion====
According to [[Judaism]], sex between man and woman within marriage is sacred and should be enjoyed; celibacy is considered sinful.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] teaches that sexuality is "noble and worthy"&lt;ref&gt;Second Vatican Council, Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the World of Today, no. 49: AAS 58 (1966), 1070&lt;/ref&gt; but that it must be used in accordance with natural law. For this reason, all sexual activity must occur in the context of a marriage between a man and a woman, and must not be divorced from the possibility of conception. Most forms of sex without the possibility of conception are considered intrinsically disordered and sinful, such as the use of contraceptives, [[masturbation]], and homosexual acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church: The Sixth Commandment|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm|website=vatican.va|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], sexual desire is considered to be a natural urge that should not be suppressed, although the concept of free sex is not accepted; these urges should be fulfilled responsibly. Marriage is considered to be a good deed; it does not hinder spiritual wayfaring. The term used for marriage within the [[Quran]] is ''nikah'', which literally means sexual intercourse. Although Islamic sexuality is restrained via [[Islamic sexual jurisprudence]], it emphasizes sexual pleasure within marriage. It is acceptable for a man to have more than one wife, but he must take care of those wives physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, and spiritually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Stearns, Peter N. | year =  | title = Major Patterns of Change and Continuity: World History in Brief | edition =  | pages =  | location =  | publisher =  | isbn =  | url =  | access-date =  | quote = }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}} Muslims believe that sexual intercourse is an act of worship that fulfils emotional and physical needs, and that producing children is one way in which humans can contribute to God's creation, and Islam discourages celibacy once an individual is married. However, homosexuality is strictly forbidden in Islam, and some Muslim lawyers have suggested that gay people should be put to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islam: beliefs about love and sex|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/relationships/isloveandsexrev1.shtml|publisher=GCSE BBC Bitesize|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some have argued that Islam has an open and playful approach to sex&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10031095/Sex-What-Muslim-women-really-want-in-the-bedroom.html], Article titled "Sex: What Muslim women really want in the bedroom", by Shelina Janmohamed, The Telegraph, 2 May 2013, accessed on 23 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "100 facts"&gt;[http://facts.randomhistory.com/islam-facts.html 100 Interesting Facts About Islam]{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; so long as it is within marriage, free of lewdness, fornication and adultery. For many Muslims, [[sex with reference to the Quran]] indicates that – bar anal intercourse and adultery – a Muslim marital home bonded by ''[[Nikah]]'' marital contract between husband and his wife(s) should enjoy and even indulge, within the privacy of their marital home, in limitless scope of [[heterosexual]] sexual acts within a [[monogamous]] or [[polygamous]] marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lifeinsideislam.wordpress.com/2015/10/22/sex-in-reference-to-the-quran/ Sex in reference to Quran] by A Taha, Accessed on 22 October 2015{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hinduism]] emphasizes that sex is only appropriate between husband and wife, in which satisfying sexual urges through sexual pleasure is an important duty of marriage. Any sex before marriage is considered to interfere with intellectual development, especially between birth and the age of 25, which is said to be brahmacharya and this should be avoided. [[Kama]] (sensual pleasures) is one of the four purusharthas or aims of life (dharma, artha, kama, and moksha).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/relationships/hiloveandsexrev1.shtml |title=GCSE Bitesize: Hindu views |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' deals partially with sexual intercourse; it is not exclusively a sexual or religious work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indrasinha.com/kama-sutra/ Common misconceptions about ''Kama Sutra''.] "The ''Kama Sutra'' is neither exclusively a sex manual nor, as also commonly used art, a sacred or religious work. It is certainly not a [[Tantra|tantric]] text. In opening with a discussion of the three aims of ancient Hindu life&amp;nbsp;– [[dharma]], [[artha]] and [[kama]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Vātsyāyana|Vatsyayana's]] purpose is to set kama, or enjoyment of the senses, in context. Thus dharma or virtuous living is the highest aim, artha, the amassing of wealth is next, and kama is the least of three." —[[Indra Sinha]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Carroll| first = Janell| title = Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity| publisher = [[Cengage Learning]]| year = 2009| page = 7| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5f8mQx7ULs4C&amp;pg=PA7| isbn = 978-0-495-60274-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Devi| first = Chandi| title = From Om to Orgasm: The Tantra Primer for Living in Bliss| publisher = [[AuthorHouse]]| year = 2008| page = 288| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gIqhh84DGToC&amp;pg=PA288| isbn = 978-1-4343-4960-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sikhism]] views [[chastity]] as important, as Sikhs believe that the divine spark of ''[[Waheguru]]'' is present inside every individual's body, therefore it is important for one to keep clean and pure. Sexual activity is limited to married couples, and extramarital sex is forbidden. Marriage is seen as a commitment to ''Waheguru'' and should be viewed as part of spiritual companionship, rather than just sexual intercourse, and [[monogamy]] is deeply emphasised in Sikhism. Any other way of living is discouraged, including celibacy and homosexuality. However, in comparison to other religions, the issue of sexuality in Sikhism is not considered one of paramount importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sikhism: beliefs about love and sex|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/relationships/sikhloveandsexrev1.shtml|publisher=GCSE BBC Bitesize|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexuality has been an important, vital part of human existence throughout history.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite book | author = Stearns, Peter N. | year =  | title = Sexuality in World History | edition =  | pages =  | location =  | publisher =  | isbn = 9780415777773 | url =  | quote = }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} All civilizations have managed sexuality through sexual standards, representations, and behavior.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

Before the rise of agriculture, groups of hunter/gatherers (H/G) and nomads inhabited the world. Within these groups, some implications of male dominance existed, but there were signs that women were active participants in sexuality, with bargaining power of their own. These hunter/gatherers had less restrictive sexual standards that emphasized sexual pleasure and enjoyment, but with definite rules and constraints. Some underlying continuities or key regulatory standards contended with the tension between recognition of pleasure, interest, and the need to procreate for the sake of social order and economic survival. H/G groups also placed high value on certain types of sexual symbolism. Two common tensions in H/G societies are expressed in their art, which emphasizes male sexuality and prowess, with equally common tendencies to blur gender lines in sexual matters. One example of these male-dominated portrayals is the [[Egyptian creation myth]], in which the sun god [[Atum]] masturbates in the water, creating the [[Nile River]]. In [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian]] myth, the Gods' semen filled the [[Tigris]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

Once agricultural societies emerged, the sexual framework shifted in ways that persisted for many millennia in much of Asia, Africa, Europe, and parts of the Americas. One common characteristic new to these societies was the collective supervision of sexual behavior due to urbanization, and the growth of population and population density. Children would commonly witness parents having sex because many families shared the same sleeping quarters. Due to landownership, determination of children's paternity became important, and society and family life became patriarchal. These changes in sexual ideology were used to control female sexuality and to differentiate standards by gender. With these ideologies, sexual possessiveness and increases in jealousy emerged. With the domestication of animals, new opportunities for [[bestiality]]  arose. Males mostly performed these types of sexual acts and many societies acquired firm rules against it. These acts also explain the many depictions of half-human, half-animal mythical creatures, and the sports of gods and goddesses with animals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; While retaining the precedents of earlier civilizations, each classical civilization established a somewhat distinctive approach to gender, artistic expression of sexual beauty, and to behaviors such as homosexuality. Some of these distinctions are portrayed in sex manuals, which were also common among civilizations in China, Greece, Rome, Persia, and India; each has its own sexual history.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

During the beginning of the [[industrial revolution]] of the 18th and 19th centuries, many changes in sexual standards occurred. New, dramatic, artificial birth control devices such as the [[condom]] and [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] were introduced. Doctors started claiming a new role in sexual matters, urging that their advice was crucial to sexual morality and health. New pornographic industries grew and Japan adopted its first laws against homosexuality. In western societies, the definition of homosexuality was constantly changing; western influence on other cultures became more prevalent. New contacts created serious issues around sexuality and sexual traditions. There were also major shifts in sexual behavior. During this period, puberty began occurring at younger ages, so a new focus on adolescence as a time of sexual confusion and danger emerged. There was a new focus on the purpose of marriage; it was increasing regarded as being for love rather than only for economics and reproduction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Alfred Kinsey]] initiated the modern era of sex research. He collected data from questionnaires given to his students at [[Indiana University]], but then switched to personal interviews about sexual behaviors. Kinsey and his colleagues sampled 5,300 men and 5,940 women. He found that most people masturbated, that many engaged in [[oral sex]], that women are capable of having multiple orgasms, and that many men had had some type of homosexual experience in their lifetimes. Many{{who|date=June 2015}} believe he was the major influence in changing 20th century attitudes about sex. [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction]] at Indiana University continues to be a major center for the study of human sexuality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} Before [[William Masters]], a physician, and [[Virginia E. Johnson|Virginia Johnson]], a [[behavioral scientist]], the study of anatomy and physiological studies of sex was still limited to experiments with laboratory animals. Masters and Johnson started to directly observe and record the physical responses in humans that are engaged in sexual activity under laboratory settings. They observed 10,000 episodes of sexual acts between 312 men and 382 women. This led to methods of treating clinical problems and abnormalities. Masters and Johnson opened the first sex therapy clinic in 1965. In 1970, they described their therapeutic techniques in their book, ''[[Human Sexual Inadequacy]]''.{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

===Reproductive and sexual rights===

===Creating a relationship===

People both consciously and subconsciously seek to attract others with whom they can form deep relationships. This may be for companionship, procreation, or an intimate relationship. This involves interactive processes whereby people find and attract potential partners and maintain a relationship. These processes, which involve attracting one or more partners and maintaining sexual interest, can include:
* [[Flirting]], the attraction of the sexual attention of another to encourage romance or sexual relations. It can involve [[body language]], conversation, joking, or brief physical contact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html SIRC Guide to Flirting. What Social Science can tell you about flirting and how to do it.] Retrieved 13 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Flirting is a socially accepted way of attracting someone. There are different types of flirting, and most people usually have one way of flirting that makes them most comfortable. When flirting, people can be polite, playful, physical, etc. Sometimes it is difficult to know whether or not the person is interested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.ku.edu/2013/09/11/new-book-outlines-five-types-flirting-styles |title= New book outlines five types of flirting styles |last=Schmidt |first=Megan | publisher=KU News Service |date=9 November 2013 |website=University of Kansas |access-date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flirting styles vary according to culture. Different cultures have different social etiquette. For example, length of eye contact, or how closely one stands by someone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,419712,00.html |title=Scoring a German: Flirting with Fräuleins, Hunting for Herren - SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=Spiegel.de |access-date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Seduction]], the process whereby one person deliberately entices another to engage in sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Greene, Robert | authorlink=Robert Greene (author) | title=The Art of Seduction | publisher=[[Penguin Books]]| year=2003 | isbn=0-14-200119-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior is one that the person you are seducing would not usually do, unless sexually aroused. Seduction can be seen as both a positive and a negative. Since the word seduction has a Latin meaning, which is "to lead astray" it can be viewed negatively.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. (1996) ''The Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual attraction===
{{Main|Sexual attraction}}
Sexual attraction is [[Attractiveness|attraction]] on the basis of [[sexual desire]] or the quality of arousing such interest.&lt;ref name="Sexual attraction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual attraction| publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|accessdate=December 16, 2011|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sexual+attraction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexual attraction2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual attraction| publisher=[[Reference.com]]|accessdate=December 16, 2011|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexual+attraction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual attractiveness or sex appeal is an individual's ability to attract the sexual or [[erotic]] interest of another person, and is a factor in [[sexual selection]] or [[mate choice]].  The attraction can be to the [[physical attraction|physical]] or other qualities or traits of a person, or to such qualities in the context in which they appear. The attraction may be to a person's [[aesthetics]] or movements or to their voice or smell, besides other factors. The attraction may be enhanced by a person's adornments, clothing, perfume, [[long hair|hair length]] and [[hair style|style]], and anything else which can attract the sexual interest of another person. It can also be influenced by [[individual]] [[Genetics|genetic]], [[psychological]], or cultural factors, or to other, more amorphous qualities of the person. Sexual attraction is also a response to another person that depends on a combination of the person possessing the traits and also on the criteria of the person who is attracted.

Though attempts have been made to devise objective criteria of sexual attractiveness, and measure it as [[individual capital|one of several bodily forms of]] [[capital asset]] (''see [[erotic capital]]''), a person's sexual attractiveness is to a large extent a subjective measure dependent on another person's interest, perception, and [[sexual orientation]]. For example, a [[Homosexuality|gay or lesbian person]] would typically find a person of the [[Same-sex attraction|same sex]] to be more attractive than one of the other sex. A [[bisexuality|bisexual person]] would find either sex to be attractive. In addition, there are [[Asexuality|asexual]] people, who usually do not experience sexual attraction for either sex, though they may have romantic attraction (homoromantic, biromantic or heteroromantic). [[Interpersonal attraction]] includes factors such as [[propinquity|physical or psychological similarity]], [[Intimate relationship#Intimacy|familiarity]] or possessing a preponderance of [[Koinophilia#Physical attractiveness|common or familiar features]], [[similarity (psychology)|similarity]], [[Interpersonal compatibility|complementarity]], [[reciprocal liking]], and [[reinforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, R., Perlman, D., and Brehm, S.S. Intimate Relationships, 4th Edition, McGrawHill Companies.{{page needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of a person's physical and other qualities to create a sexual interest in others is the basis of their use in [[sex in advertising|advertising]], [[music video]], [[pornography]], [[Sex in film|film]], and other visual media, as well as in [[Model (person)|modeling]], [[sex work]] and other occupations.

===Legal issues===
{{one source|section|date=June 2016}}
{{Main|Human sexual activity#Legal issues|Sex and the law}}
Globally, laws regulate human sexuality in several ways, including criminalizing particular sexual behaviors, granting individuals the privacy or [[autonomy]] to make their own sexual decisions, protecting individuals with regard to equality and non-discrimination, recognizing and protecting other individual rights, as well as legislating matters regarding marriage and the family, and creating laws protecting individuals from violence, harassment, and persecution.&lt;ref name=SexualityLaw1&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Mills |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Haste |first2=Polly |last3=Wood |first3=Stephen | date = 17 June 2016 | title = 1. Issues and Debates; How is sexuality regulated in law? | work = Sexuality and Social Justice: A Toolkit | location = Brighton, UK | publisher = Institute of Development Studies, Sexuality, Poverty and Law Programme | url = http://www.spl.ids.ac.uk/sexuality-and-social-justice-toolkit/1-issues-and-debates/how-sexuality-regulated-law  | access-date =  17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, there are two fundamentally different approaches, applied in different states, regarding the way the law is used to attempt to govern a person's sexuality.  The “black letter” approach to law focuses on the study of pre-existing legal precedent, and attempts to offer a clear framework of rules within which lawyers and others can work.&lt;ref name=SexualityLaw1/&gt; In contrast, the socio-legal approach focuses more broadly on the relationship between the law and society, and offers a more contextualized view of the relationship between legal and social change.&lt;ref name=SexualityLaw1/&gt; Both approaches are used to guide changes in the legal system of states, and both have an effect.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Issues regarding human sexuality and human sexual orientation have come to the forefront in Westerm law in the latter half of the twentieth century, as part of the [[gay liberation]] movement's encouragement of LGBT individuals to "[[come out of the closet]]" and engaging with the legal system, primarily through courts. Therefore, many issues regarding human sexuality and the law are found in the opinions of the courts.&lt;ref name=Minnesota1&gt;{{cite web|title=Researching Legal Issues of Sexual Orientation|url=https://library.law.umn.edu/researchguides/sexual-orientation.html|website=library.law.umn.edu|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=3 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705012329/https://library.law.umn.edu/researchguides/sexual-orientation.html|archivedate=5 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual privacy====
{{See also|Sexual and reproductive health and rights}}
While the issue of privacy has been useful to sexual rights claims, some scholars have criticized its usefulness, saying that this perspective is too narrow and restrictive. The law is often slow to intervene in certain forms of coercive behavior that can limit individuals' control over their own sexuality (such as [[female genital mutilation]], [[forced marriages]] or lack of access to reproductive health care). Many of these injustices are often perpetuated wholly or in part by private individuals rather than state agents, and as a result, there is an ongoing debate about the extent of state responsibility to prevent harmful practices and to investigate such practices when they do occur.&lt;ref name=SexualityLaw1 /&gt;

State intervention with regards to sexuality also occurs, and is considered acceptable by some, in certain instances (e.g. same-sex sexual activity or [[prostitution]]).&lt;ref name=SexualityLaw1 /&gt;

'''Immunodermatology''' studies [[skin]] as an organ of [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] in health and disease. Several areas have special attention, such as photo-immunology (effects of [[Ultraviolet|UV]] light on skin defense), [[inflammation|inflammatory]] diseases such as [[Hidradenitis suppurativa]], [[allergy|allergic]] contact [[dermatitis]] and [[atopic eczema]], presumably [[autoimmune]] skin diseases such as [[vitiligo]] and [[psoriasis]], and finally the [[immunology]] of [[microbial]] skin diseases such as [[retrovirus]] infections and [[leprosy]]. New therapies in development for the [[Immunosuppressant|immunomodulation]] of common immunological skin diseases include [[Biomolecule|biologicals]] aimed at neutralizing [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNF-alfa]] and [[chemokine receptor]] inhibitors.

In [[physics]], an '''infrared fixed point''' is a set of coupling constants, or other parameters that evolve from initial values at very high energies (short distance), to fixed stable values, usually predictable, at low energies (large distance). This usually involves the use of the [[renormalization group]], which specifically details the way parameters in a physical system (a [[quantum field theory]]) depend on the energy scale being probed.

Conversely, if the length-scale decreases and the physical parameters approach fixed values, then we have [[ultraviolet fixed point]]s.  The fixed points are generally independent of the initial values of the parameters over a large range of the initial values. This is known as [[Universality (dynamical systems)|universality]].

==Statistical physics==
In the [[statistical physics]] of second order [[phase transition]]s, the physical system approaches an infrared fixed point that is independent of the
initial short distance dynamics that defines the material. This determines the properties of the phase transition at the [[critical temperature]], or  [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]. Observables, such as [[critical exponents]] usually depend only upon dimension of space, and are independent of the atomic or molecular constituents.

==Top Quark==

===Standard Model===

There is a remarkable infrared fixed point of the coupling constants that determine the masses of very heavy quarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pendleton|first1=B.|last2=Ross|first2=G.G.|title=Mass and Mixing Angle Predictions from Infrared Fixed points|journal=Phys. Lett.|date=1981|volume=B98|page=291|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(81)90017-4|bibcode = 1981PhLB...98..291P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=C.T.|title=Quark and Lepton masses from Renormalization group fixed points|journal=Phys. Rev.|date=1981|volume=D24|page=691|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.24.691|bibcode = 1981PhRvD..24..691H }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Standard Model]], quarks and leptons have "[[Yukawa interaction|Yukawa coupling]]s" to the [[Higgs boson]]. These determine the mass of the particle. All of the quarks' and leptons' Yukawa couplings are small compared to the [[top quark]]'s Yukawa coupling. Yukawa couplings are not constants and their properties change depending on the energy scale at which they are measured, this is known as ''[[Renormalization group|running]]'' of the constants. The dynamics of Yukawa couplings are determined by the [[Exact renormalization group equation|renormalization group equation]]:

&lt;math&gt;\mu \frac{\partial}{\partial\mu} y  \approx \frac{y}{16\pi^2}\left(\frac{9}{2}y^2 - 8 g_3^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;g_3&lt;/math&gt; is the [[color charge|color]] [[gauge theory|gauge]] coupling (which is a function of  &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and associated with [[asymptotic freedom]])  and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the Yukawa coupling. This equation describes how the Yukawa coupling changes with energy scale &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.

The Yukawa couplings of the up, down, charm, strange and bottom quarks, are small at the extremely high energy scale of [[Grand Unified Theory|grand unification]], &lt;math&gt; \mu \approx 10^{15} &lt;/math&gt; GeV.  Therefore, the &lt;math&gt;y^2&lt;/math&gt; term can be neglected in the above equation. Solving, we then find that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;  is increased slightly at the low energy scales at which the quark masses are generated by the Higgs, &lt;math&gt; \mu \approx 100 &lt;/math&gt; GeV.

On the other hand, solutions to this equation for large initial values &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; cause the ''rhs'' to quickly approach zero {{when|date=February 2015}}. This locks &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; to the QCD coupling &lt;math&gt;g_3&lt;/math&gt; {{clarify|date=February 2015}}. This is known as a (quasi-infrared) fixed point of the renormalization group equation for the Yukawa coupling.  No matter what the initial starting value of the coupling is, if it is sufficiently large it will reach this fixed point value, and the corresponding quark mass is predicted.

The value of the fixed point is fairly precisely determined in the Standard Model, leading to a predicted [[top quark]] mass of 230 &amp;nbsp;GeV. If there is more than one Higgs doublet, the value will be reduced by [[Higgs mixing angle]] effects.  The observed top quark mass is slightly lower, about 171 GeV.

===Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model===

In the [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model|minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model]] (MSSM), there are two Higgs doublets and the renormalization group equation for the top quark Yukawa coupling is slightly modified. This leads to a fixed point where the top mass is smaller, 170–200&amp;nbsp;GeV. Some theorists believe this is supporting evidence for the MSSM.

The  "quasi-infrared fixed point" was proposed in 1981 by [[C. T. Hill]], B. Pendleton and G. G. Ross. The prevailing view at the time was that the top quark mass would lie in a range of 15 to 26 GeV. The quasi-infrared fixed point has formed the basis of [[top quark condensation]] theories of electroweak symmetry breaking in which the Higgs boson is composite at ''extremely'' short distance scales, composed of a pair of top and anti-top quarks. Many authors have explored other aspects of infrared fixed points to understand the anticipated spectrum of Higgs bosons in multi-Higgs models.

==Banks-Zaks fixed point==

Another example of an infrared fixed point is the [[Banks-Zaks fixed point]] in which the coupling constant of a Yang-Mills theory evolves to a fixed value. The beta-function vanishes, and the theory possesses a symmetry known as [[conformal symmetry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10290">'''Ledger art''' is a term for [[Plains Indians|Plains Indian]] narrative drawing or painting on paper or cloth. Ledger art flourished primarily from the 1860s to the 1920s. A revival of ledger art began in the 1960s and 1970s. The term comes from the accounting [[ledger]] books that were a common source of paper for [[Plains Indians]] during the late 19th century.

==Historical precedents==
[[File:At the Sand Creek Massacre, 1874-1875.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sand Creek massacre]] as drawn by eyewitness [[Howling Wolf (Cheyenne)|Howling Wolf]] (1874–1875).]]
Ledger art evolved from [[Plains hide painting]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;[https://plainsledgerart.org/history/ "Ledger Art History."] ''Department of Ethnic Studies, University of California San Diego: Plains Indian Ledger Art Project.'' 2011 (retrieved 2 Oct 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Among Plains tribes, women traditionally paint abstract, geometrical designs, whereas men paint [[Representation (arts)|representational]] designs. The men's designs were often heraldic devices or visions painted on shields, [[tipi]]s, shirts, leggings, or robes. Before the Plains tribes were forced to live on reservations in the 1870s, men generally painted personal feats in battle or hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 138&lt;/ref&gt; Plains ledger art depicted communally acknowledged events of valor and tribal importance in order to gain status for the individuals who participated in them, and their band and kin.  Plains pictorial art emphasizes narrative action and eliminates unnecessary detail or backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Figures tended to be drawn in hard outlines and filled with solid fields of color.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

These were all traditionally painted on animal hides – particularly [[American bison|buffalo]] hides. When buffalo became scarce after eradication programs encouraged by the US federal government, Plains artists began painting and drawing on paper, canvas, and muslin.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

==New materials==
An increasing supply of ledger books and other paper came from traders, government agents, missionaries, and military officers.&lt;ref&gt;Swan, 70&lt;/ref&gt; With these came pencils, ink fountain pens, crayons, and watercolor paints.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 139&lt;/ref&gt; These new tools allowed for greater detail and experimentation than the earlier tools, such as bone or wood styli dipped in mineral pigments, had. The compact ledger books and pencils were highly portable, making them ideal for nomadic lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fort Marion==
[[File:Blackhawk-spiritbeing.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Drawing by [[Black Hawk (artist)|Black Hawk]] ([[Sans Arc|Sans Arc Lakota]]), c. 1880 depicting a horned Thunder Being (''Haokah'') on a horse-like creature with eagle talons and buffalo horns. The creature's tail forms a rainbow that represents the entrance to the Spirit World, and the dots represent hail. Accompanying the picture on the page were the words: "Dream or vision of himself changed to a destroyer and riding a buffalo eagle."]]
The most celebrated ledger artists were prisoners of war at [[Castillo de San Marcos|Fort Marion]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. In 1874, in what became known as the [[Red River War]] or Buffalo War, a group of [[Cheyenne]], [[Kiowa]], [[Comanche]], [[Arapaho]], and [[Caddo]] warriors fought the US Army to protect the last free herd of buffalo and to assert their autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 12–14&lt;/ref&gt; In the harsh winter of 1874 to 1875, many tribal camps were forced to surrender to various Indian agencies, and the supposed leaders of the Red River War were rounded up and sent to Fort Marion.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 14&lt;/ref&gt; From 1875 to 1878, the 71 men and one woman were under the command of [[Richard Henry Pratt]], who used the opportunity to give the Indians a Western education.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

He also provided the prisoners with basic art supplies, such as pencils, ink, crayons, watercolor paint, and paper.

Twenty-six of the Fort Marion prisoners engaged in drawing. They were younger Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Kiowa men.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 29&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most prolific and well-known artists include [[Paul Caryl Zotom]] (Kiowa); [[David Pendleton Oakerhater]] or Making Medicine (Cheyenne); [[Tichkematse]] or Squint Eyes (Cheyenne), who later worked for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, DC; [[Wohaw]] (Kiowa); [[Howling Wolf (Cheyenne)]]; [[Etahdleuh Doanmoe]] (Kiowa); White Bear (Arapaho); Koba (Kiowa); and [[Bear’s Heart]] (Cheyenne).  Tichtematse, Howling Wolf, White Bear, and Koba all continued drawing after their release from prison.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Battle exploits dominated ledger art. Other traditional themes such as hunting, courtship,&lt;ref name=gus&gt;Fauntleroy, Gussie. [http://www.nativepeoples.com/Native-Peoples/September-October-2011/Looking-Between-the-Lines/#.Tj60ZAFyY4Y.facebook "Ledger Art: Looking Between the Lines."] ''Native Peoples.'' Sept/Oct 2011 (retrieved 7 Aug 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; and religious practices were common subjects. Ledger artists also documented their rapidly changing environment by portraying encroaching European Americans and new technologies such as trains and cameras. Many ledger artists worked with ethnologists, by documenting shield and tipi designs, ethnobotanical information, [[winter count]]s, dance customs and regalia, and other cultural information. Dreams and visions inspired ledger art just as they had inspired earlier hide paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The artists creating ledger art today often reference pre-reservation lifeways, historical transitions, and social commentary.  They use this style to illustrate cultural continuity between historical and contemporary Native life.&lt;ref name=gus/&gt;

==As fine art==
[[File:RedDogDrawing.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The warrior "Low Dog" by Red Dog, 1884 ledger art]]
Missionaries, anthropologists, and tourists eagerly collected ledger books in the late 19th century. [[Carl Sweezy]] (1881–1953) (Arapaho) and ''[[Haungooah]]'' (Silver Horn) (1860–1940) (Kiowa) both established professional careers as ledger artists.

They inspired the [[Kiowa Five]] or, as they are increasingly known, the Kiowa Six.  These artists painted with more sophisticated materials and met with international success when they exhibited their work in the 1928 International Art Congress in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]].

==Today==
Numerous modern Plains artists create ledger paintings, including many women artists despite its history as a male domain.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;  Many seek out 19th-century documents on which to paint, creating ironic juxtapositions between the printed text and the paintings. [[Dwayne Wilcox]] ([[Oglala Lakota]]) uses the style of 19th-century Lakota painters to express humorous views of modern realities for Lakota people. [[Arthur Amiotte]] (Oglala Lakota) builds upon the collage aspect of ledger art and combines text, photography, naturalistic painting and stylized Plains pictorial art in his work. [[Dolores Purdy Corcoran]] ([[Caddo]]/[[Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska|Winnebago]]) is a female ledger artist who uses bright colors and female figures frequently in her work.&lt;ref&gt;Fauntleroy, Gussie.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1957">A '''loosely associated statement''' is a type of [[simple non-inferential passage]] wherein statements about a general subject are juxtaposed but make no inferential claim.&lt;ref name="Conciselogic"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Concise Introduction to Logic 10th ed. | publisher=Thompson Wadsworth | author=Hurley, Patrick J. | year=2008 | pages=17 | isbn=0-495-50383-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[rhetorical device]], loosely associated statements may be intended by the speaker to infer a claim or conclusion, but because they lack a coherent logical structure any such interpretation is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] as loosely associated statements prove nothing and attempt no obvious conclusion.&lt;ref name="Logicofarguments"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.julianhermida.com/algoma/law1studyarguments.htm | title=The logic of arguments | accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Loosely associated statements can be said to serve no obvious purpose, such as illustration or explanation.&lt;ref name="NONargument"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://academic.csuohio.edu/polen/LC9_Help/1/12loosely.htm | title=NONargument - Loosely associated statements | accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Included statements can be premises, conclusions or both, and both true or false, but missing from the passage is a claim that any one statement supports another.

== Examples ==
In ''A concise introduction to logic'', Hurley demonstrates the concept with a quote by [[Lao-Tzu]]:

{{quote |Not to honor men of worth will keep the people from contention; not to value goods which are hard to come by will keep them from theft; not to display what is desirable will keep them from being unsettled of mind. |Lao-Tzu}}

While each clause in the quote may seem related to the others, each provides no reason to believe another.

{{Nanotech}}
'''Nanotoxicology''' is the study of the [[toxicity]] of [[nanomaterials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buzea|first=Cristina|last2=Pacheco|first2=Ivan I.|last3=Robbie|first3=Kevin| title = Nanomaterials and nanoparticles: sources and toxicity | journal = Biointerphases | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = MR17-71 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 20419892 | doi = 10.1116/1.2815690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of quantum size effects and large surface area to volume ratio, nanomaterials have unique properties compared with their larger counterparts that affect their toxicity.  Of the possible hazards, [[inhalation exposure]] appears to present the most concern, with [[Animal testing|animal studies]] showing pulmonary effects such as [[inflammation]], [[Pulmonary fibrosis|fibrosis]], and [[Carcinogen|carcinogenicity]] for some nanomaterials. Skin contact and ingestion exposure are also a concern.

==Background==
[[Nanomaterials]] have at least one primary dimension of less than 100 [[Nanometre|nanometers]], and often have properties different from those of their bulk components that are technologically useful.  Because [[nanotechnology]] is a recent development, the health and safety effects of exposures to nanomaterials, and what levels of exposure may be acceptable, is not yet fully understood.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2014-102/default.html|title=Current Strategies for Engineering Controls in Nanomaterial Production and Downstream Handling Processes|last=|first=|date=November 2013|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=1–3|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nanoparticles can be divided into combustion-derived nanoparticles (like diesel soot), manufactured nanoparticles like carbon nanotubes and naturally occurring nanoparticles from volcanic eruptions, atmospheric chemistry etc. Typical nanoparticles that have been studied are [[Titanium dioxide nanoparticle|titanium dioxide]], alumina, zinc oxide, [[carbon black]], [[Carbon nanotube|carbon nanotubes]], and [[buckminsterfullerene]].

Nanotoxicology is a sub-specialty of particle toxicology. Nanomaterials appear to have toxicity effects that are unusual and not seen with larger particles.  For example, even inert elements like gold become highly active at [[nanometre|nanometer]] dimensions. Nanotoxicological studies are intended to determine whether and to what extent these properties may pose a threat to the environment and to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mahmoudi|first=Morteza|last2=Hofmann|first2=Heinrich|last3=Rothen-Rutishauser|first3=Barbara|last4=Petri-Fink|first4=Alke|date=April 2012|title=Assessing the in vitro and in vivo toxicity of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=112|issue=4|pages=2323–38|doi=10.1021/cr2002596|pmid=22216932}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nanoparticles have much larger surface area to unit mass ratios which in some cases may lead to greater pro-inflammatory effects in, for example, lung tissue. In addition, some nanoparticles seem to be able to translocate from their site of deposition to distant sites such as the blood and the brain.

Nanoparticles can be inhaled, swallowed, absorbed through skin and deliberately or accidentally injected during medical procedures. They might be accidentally or inadvertently released from materials implanted into living tissue.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oberdörster|first=Günter|last2=Maynard|first2=Andrew|last3=Donaldson|first3=Ken|last4=Castranova|first4=Vincent|last5=Fitzpatrick|first5=Julie|last6=Ausman|first6=Kevin|last7=Carter|first7=Janet|last8=Karn|first8=Barbara|last9=Kreyling|first9=Wolfgang| title = Principles for characterizing the potential human health effects from exposure to nanomaterials: elements of a screening strategy | journal = Particle and Fibre Toxicology | volume = 2 | pages = 8 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16209704 | doi = 10.1186/1743-8977-2-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoet|first=Peter HM|last2=Brüske-Hohlfeld|first2=Irene|last3=Salata|first3=Oleg V.| title = Nanoparticles - known and unknown health risks | journal = Journal of Nanobiotechnology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 12 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15588280 | doi = 10.1186/1477-3155-2-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oberdörster|first=Günter|last2=Oberdörster|first2=Eva|last3=Oberdörster|first3=Jan| title = Nanotoxicology: an emerging discipline evolving from studies of ultrafine particles | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 113 | issue = 7 | pages = 823–39 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 16002369 | pmc = 1257642 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.7339 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study considers release of airborne engineered nanoparticles at workplaces, and associated worker exposure from various production and handling activities, to be very probable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ding|first=Yaobo|last2=Kuhlbusch|first2=Thomas A.J.|last3=Tongeren|first3=Martie Van|last4=Jiménez|first4=Araceli Sánchez|last5=Tuinman|first5=Ilse|last6=Chen|first6=Rui|last7=Alvarez|first7=Iñigo Larraza|last8=Mikolajczyk|first8=Urszula|last9=Nickel|first9=Carmen| title = Airborne engineered nanomaterials in the workplace-a review of release and worker exposure during nanomaterial production and handling processes | journal = Journal of Hazardous Materials | volume = 322 | issue = Pt A | pages = 17–28 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27181990 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.04.075 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties that affect toxicity==
Size is a key factor in determining the potential toxicity of a particle. However it is not the only important factor. Other properties of nanomaterials that influence toxicity include: chemical composition, shape, surface structure, surface charge, aggregation and solubility,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
and the presence or absence of [[functional group]]s of other chemicals. 
The large number of variables influencing toxicity means that it is difficult to generalise about health risks associated with exposure to nanomaterials – each new nanomaterial must be assessed individually and all material properties must be taken into account.
=== Composition ===

==== Metal-based ====
Metal based [[nanoparticle]]s (NPs) are a prominent class of NPs synthesized for their functions as [[semiconductor]]s, [[Electroluminescence|electroluminescents]], and [[thermoelectric materials]].&lt;ref name="seabra-metalnp"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Seabra | first = Amedea B. | last2 = Durán | first2 = Nelson | name-list-format = vanc | date= June 2015 | title=Nanotoxicology of Metal Oxide Nanoparticles | journal = Metals |volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 934–975 | doi = 10.3390/met5020934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomedically, these [[Antibiotics|antibacterial]] NPs have been utilized in drug delivery systems to access areas previously inaccessible to conventional medicine. With the recent increase in interest and development of [[nanotechnology]], many studies have been performed to assess whether the unique characteristics of these NPs, namely their small surface area to volume ratio, might negatively impact the environment upon which they were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schrand|first=Amanda M.|last2=Rahman|first2=Mohammad F.|last3=Hussain|first3=Saber M.|last4=Schlager|first4=John J.|last5=Smith|first5=David A.|last6=Syed|first6=Ali F.|date=2010-09-01|title=Metal-based nanoparticles and their toxicity assessment|url=|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Nanomedicine and Nanobiotechnology|language=en|volume=2|issue=5|pages=544–568|doi=10.1002/wnan.103|issn=1939-0041|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have since found that many metal and metal oxide NPs have detrimental effects on the cells with which they come into contact including but not limited to DNA breakage and oxidation, mutations, reduced cell viability, warped [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], induced [[apoptosis]] and [[necrosis]], and decreased proliferation.&lt;ref name="seabra-metalnp" /&gt;

==== Carbon-based ====
{{Main|Toxicology of carbon nanomaterials}}The latest toxicology studies on mice as of 2013 involving exposure to [[carbon nanotubes]] (CNT) showed a limited pulmonary inflammatory potential of [[MWCNT]] at levels corresponding to the average inhalable elemental carbon concentrations observed in U.S.-based CNT facilities. The study estimated that considerable years of exposure are necessary for significant pathology to occur.&lt;ref name="Carbon nanotube dosimetry: from workplace exposure assessment to inhalation toxicology"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Erdely A, Dahm M, Chen BT, Zeidler-Erdely PC, Fernback JE, Birch ME, Evans DE, Kashon ML, Deddens JA, Hulderman T, Bilgesu SA, Battelli L, Schwegler-Berry D, Leonard HD, McKinney W, Frazer DG, Antonini JM, Porter DW, Castranova V, Schubauer-Berigan MK | display-authors = 6 | title = Carbon nanotube dosimetry: from workplace exposure assessment to inhalation toxicology | journal = Particle and Fibre Toxicology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 53 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24144386 | doi = 10.1186/1743-8977-10-53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One review concludes that the evidence gathered since the discovery of fullerenes overwhelmingly points to C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; being non-toxic. As is the case for toxicity profile with any chemical modification of a structural moiety, the authors suggest that individual molecules be assessed individually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/451336793|title=Bio-applications of nanoparticles|last=|first=|date=2007|publisher=Springer|others=|year=|isbn=0387767126|editor-last=Chan|editor-first=Warren C. W.|location=|pages=|oclc=451336793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other ====
Other classes of nanomaterials include polymers such as [[nanocellulose]], and [[Dendrimer|dendrimers]].

=== Size ===
There are many ways that size can affect the toxicity of a nanoparticle.  For example, particles of different sizes can deposit in different places in the lungs, and are cleared from the lungs at different rates.  Size can also affect the particles' [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] and the specific mechanism by which they are toxic.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powers|first=Kevin W.|last2=Palazuelos|first2=Maria|last3=Moudgil|first3=Brij M.|last4=Roberts|first4=Stephen M.|date=2007-01-01|title=Characterization of the size, shape, and state of dispersion of nanoparticles for toxicological studies|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17435390701314902|journal=Nanotoxicology|volume=1|issue=1|pages=42–51|doi=10.1080/17435390701314902|issn=1743-5390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dispersion state===
[[File:Nanomaterials.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nanomaterials.png|alt=Three greyscale microscope images arranged horizontally.  The left two show agglomerations of black spots on a grey background, while the right one shows a mass of tangled fibers.|thumb|400x400px|Nanomaterials present in aerosol particles are often in an agglomerated or aggregated state, which affects their toxicological properties.  The examples shown here are [[Silver nanoparticle|silver nanoparticles]], [[nickel]] nanoparticles, and multiwalled [[Carbon nanotube|carbon nanotubes]].]]
Many nanoparticles agglomerate or aggregate when they are placed in environmental or biological fluids.  The terms agglomeration and aggregation have distinct definitions according to the standards organizations ISO and ASTM, where  agglomeration signifies more loosely bound particles and aggregation signifies very tightly bound or fused particles  (typically occurring during synthesis or drying).  Nanoparticles frequently agglomerate due to the high ionic strength of  environmental and biological fluids, which shields the repulsion due to charges on the nanoparticles.  Unfortunately,  agglomeration has frequently been ignored in nanotoxicity studies, even though agglomeration would be expected to affect  nanotoxicity since it changes the size, surface area, and sedimentation properties of the nanoparticles.  In addition, many  nanoparticles will agglomerate to some extent in the environment or in the body before they reach their target, so it is desirable to study how toxicity is affected by agglomeration.

The agglomeration/deagglomeration (mechanical stability) potentials of airborne engineered nanoparticle clusters also have significant influences on their size distribution profiles at the end-point of their environmental transport routes. Different aerosolization and deagglomeration systems have been established to test stability of nanoparticle agglomerates.

=== Surface chemistry and charge ===
[[Nanoparticle|NPs]], in their implementation, are covered with coatings and sometimes given positive or negative charges depending upon the intended function. Studies have found that these external factors affect the degree of toxicity of NPs.

== Routes of administration ==
=== Respiratory ===
[[File:Carbon_nanotubes_penetrating_lung_cell.tif|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carbon_nanotubes_penetrating_lung_cell.tif|alt=A greyscale microscope image showing a rigid rod extending from both sides of a mottled cellular mass|thumb|A [[scanning electron microscope]] image of bundles of multiwalled [[carbon nanotube]] piercing an [[Alveolar cells|alveolar epithelial cell]].]]
[[Inhalation exposure]] is the most common route of exposure to airborne particles in the workplace. The deposition of nanoparticles in the respiratory tract is determined by the shape and size of particles or their agglomerates, and they are deposited in the lungs to a greater extent than larger respirable particles.  Based on [[Animal testing|animal studies]], nanoparticles may enter the bloodstream from the lungs and translocate to other organs, including the brain.&lt;ref name="Approaches to safe nanotechnology"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2009-125/|title=Approaches to Safe Nanotechnology: Managing the Health and Safety Concerns Associated with Engineered Nanomaterials|last=|first=|date=March 2009|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=11–12|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The inhalation risk is affected by the [[dustiness]] of the material, the tendency of particles to become airborne in response to a stimulus.  Dust generation is affected by the particle shape, size, bulk density, and inherent electrostatic forces, and whether the nanomaterial is a dry powder or incorporated into a [[slurry]] or liquid [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]].&lt;ref name="General safe practices for working"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-147/|title=General Safe Practices for Working with Engineered Nanomaterials in Research Laboratories|last=|first=|date=May 2012|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=5–6|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal studies indicate that [[Carbon nanotube|carbon nanotubes]] and [[Carbon nanofiber|carbon nanofibers]] can cause pulmonary effects including [[inflammation]], [[Granuloma|granulomas]], and [[pulmonary fibrosis]], which were of similar or greater potency when compared with other known [[Fibrosis|fibrogenic]] materials such as [[Silica gel|silica]], [[asbestos]], and ultrafine [[carbon black]].  Some studies in cells or animals have shown [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] or [[Carcinogen|carcinogenic]] effects, or systemic [[Cardiovascular system|cardiovascular]] effects from pulmonary exposure.  Although the extent to which animal data may predict clinically significant lung effects in workers is not known, the toxicity seen in the short-term animal studies indicate a need for protective action for workers exposed to these nanomaterials.  As of 2013, further research was needed in long-term animal studies and [[Epidemiology|epidemiologic]] studies in workers. No reports of actual adverse health effects in workers using or producing these nanomaterials were known as of 2013.&lt;ref name="Current intelligence bulletin 65 - Carbon nanotubes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-145/|title=Current Intelligence Bulletin 65: Occupational Exposure to Carbon Nanotubes and Nanofibers|last=|first=|date=April 2013|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=v–ix, 33–35, 63–64|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Titanium dioxide]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) dust is considered a [[lung tumor]] risk, with [[Ultrafine particle|ultrafine]] (nanoscale) particles having an increased mass-based potency relative to fine TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, through a secondary genotoxicity mechanism that is not specific to TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but primarily related to particle size and surface area.&lt;ref name="Current intelligence bulletin 63 - TiO2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-160/|title=Current Intelligence Bulletin 63: Occupational Exposure to Titanium Dioxide|last=|first=|date=April 2011|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=v–vii, 73–78|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dermal ===
Some studies suggest that nanomaterials could potentially enter the body through intact skin during occupational exposure.  Studies have shown that particles smaller than 1 μm in diameter may penetrate into mechanically flexed skin samples, and that nanoparticles with varying physicochemical properties were able to penetrate the intact skin of pigs.  Factors such as size, shape, water solubility, and surface coating directly affect a nanoparticle’s potential to penetrate the skin.  At this time, it is not fully known whether skin penetration of nanoparticles would result in adverse effects in animal models, although topical application of raw SWCNT to nude mice has been shown to cause dermal irritation, and ''[[in vitro]]'' studies using primary or cultured human skin cells have shown that carbon nanotubes can enter cells and cause release of [[Proinflammatory cytokine|pro-inflammatory cytokines]], [[oxidative stress]], and decreased viability.  It remains unclear, however, how these findings may be extrapolated to a potential occupational risk.&lt;ref name="Approaches to safe nanotechnology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Current intelligence bulletin 65 - Carbon nanotubes" /&gt;  In addition, nanoparticles may enter the body through wounds, with particles migrating into the blood and lymph nodes.&lt;ref name="Radiation safety aspects"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncrppublications.org/Reports/176|title=Radiation Safety Aspects of Nanotechnology|last=|first=|date=2017-03-02|website=[[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]]|pages=88–90|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gastrointestinal ===
Ingestion can occur from unintentional hand to mouth transfer of materials; this has been found to happen with traditional materials, and it is scientifically reasonable to assume that it also could happen during handling of nanomaterials.  Ingestion may also accompany inhalation exposure because particles that are cleared from the respiratory tract via the [[mucociliary escalator]] may be swallowed.&lt;ref name="Approaches to safe nanotechnology" /&gt;

==Biodistribution==
[[File:Nanotoxicology.jpg|thumb|225px|Pathways of exposure to nanoparticles and associated diseases as suggested by epidemiological, in vivo and in vitro studies.]]
The extremely small size of nanomaterials also means that they much more readily gain entry into the [[human body]] than larger sized particles.  How these nanoparticles behave inside the body is still a major question that needs to be resolved. The behavior of nanoparticles is a function of their size, shape and surface reactivity with the surrounding tissue. In principle, a large number of particles could overload the body's [[phagocytes]], cells that ingest and destroy foreign matter, thereby triggering stress reactions that lead to inflammation and weaken the body’s defense against other pathogens. In addition to questions about what happens if non-degradable or slowly degradable nanoparticles accumulate in bodily organs, another concern is their potential interaction or interference with biological processes inside the body. Because of their large surface area, nanoparticles will, on exposure to tissue and fluids, immediately [[Adsorption|adsorb]] onto their surface some of the macromolecules they encounter. This may, for instance, affect the regulatory mechanisms of enzymes and other proteins.

Nanomaterials are able to cross biological membranes and access [[Cell (biology)|cells]], tissues and organs that larger-sized particles normally cannot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holsapple|first=Michael P.|last2=Farland|first2=William H.|last3=Landry|first3=Timothy D.|last4=Monteiro-Riviere|first4=Nancy A.|last5=Carter|first5=Janet M.|last6=Walker|first6=Nigel J.|last7=Thomas|first7=Karluss V.| title = Research strategies for safety evaluation of nanomaterials, part II: toxicological and safety evaluation of nanomaterials, current challenges and data needs | language = en | journal = Toxicological Sciences | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–7 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16120754 | doi = 10.1093/toxsci/kfi293 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Nanomaterials can gain access to the blood stream via inhalation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
or ingestion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Broken skin is an ineffective particle barrier, suggesting that acne, eczema, shaving wounds or severe sunburn may accelerate skin uptake of nanomaterials.  Then, once in the blood stream, nanomaterials can be transported around the body and be taken up by organs and tissues, including the brain, heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, bone marrow and nervous system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
Nanomaterials have proved toxic to human tissue and cell cultures, resulting in increased [[oxidative stress]], inflammatory [[cytokine]] production and [[Necrosis|cell death]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Mechanisms of toxicity ==

===Oxidative stress===
For some types of [[Nanoparticles|particles]], the smaller they are, the greater their surface area to volume ratio and the higher their chemical reactivity and biological activity.  The greater chemical reactivity of nanomaterials can result in increased production of [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS), including [[free radical]]s. 
ROS production has been found in a diverse range of nanomaterials including carbon [[fullerene]]s, [[carbon nanotube]]s and nanoparticle metal oxides. ROS and free radical production is one of the primary mechanisms of nanoparticle toxicity; it may result in oxidative stress, inflammation, and consequent damage to proteins, membranes and DNA.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nel|first=Andre|last2=Xia|first2=Tian|last3=Mädler|first3=Lutz|last4=Li|first4=Ning| title = Toxic potential of materials at the nanolevel | language = en | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5761 | pages = 622–7 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16456071 | doi = 10.1126/science.1114397 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cytotoxicity ===
A primary marker for the damaging effects of NPs has been cell viability as determined by state and exposed surface area of the cell membrane. Cells exposed to metallic NPs have, in the case of copper oxide, had up to 60% of their cells rendered unviable. When diluted, the positively charged metal ions often experience an electrostatic attraction to the cell membrane of nearby cells, covering the membrane and preventing it from permeating the necessary fuels and wastes.&lt;ref name="seabra-metalnp" /&gt; With less exposed membrane for transportation and communication, the cells are often rendered inactive.

NPs have been found to induce [[apoptosis]] in certain cells primarily due to the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l damage and [[oxidative stress]] brought on by the foreign NPs electrostatic reactions.&lt;ref name="seabra-metalnp" /&gt;

=== Genotoxicity ===
Metal Oxides such as copper oxide, [[uraninite]], and [[Cobalt oxide nanoparticles|cobalt oxide]] have also been found to exert significant stress on exposed [[DNA]].&lt;ref name="seabra-metalnp" /&gt; The damage done to the [[DNA]] will often result in [[Mutation|mutated]] cells and colonies as found with the [[HPRT - Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency|HPRT]] gene test.

==Methods and standards==
[[Characterization of nanoparticles|Characterization of a nanomaterial's physical and chemical properties]] is important for ensuring the [[reproducibility]] of toxicology studies, and is also vital for studying how the properties of nanomaterials determine their biological effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powers|first=Kevin W.|last2=Brown|first2=Scott C.|last3=Krishna|first3=Vijay B.|last4=Wasdo|first4=Scott C.|last5=Moudgil|first5=Brij M.|last6=Roberts|first6=Stephen M.|date=2006-04-01|title=Research Strategies for Safety Evaluation of Nanomaterials.

With comparison to more conventional toxicology studies, in nanotoxicology, characterisation of the potential contaminants is challenging. The biological systems are themselves still not completely known at this scale. Visualisation methods such as [[electron microscopy]] (SEM and TEM) and [[atomic force microscopy]] (AFM) analysis allow visualisation of the nano world. Further nanotoxicology studies will require precise characterisation of the specificities of a given nano-element : size, chemical composition, detailed shape, level of aggregation, combination with other vectors, etc. Above all, these properties would have to be determined not only on the nanocomponent before its introduction in the living environment but also in the (mostly aqueous) biological environment.

There is a need for new methodologies to quickly assess the presence and reactivity of nanoparticles in commercial, environmental, and biological samples since current detection techniques require expensive and complex analytical instrumentation.

== Policy and regulatory aspects ==
Toxicology studies of nanomaterials are a key input into determining [[Occupational exposure limit|occupational exposure limits]].

The Royal Society identifies the potential for nanoparticles to penetrate the skin, and recommends that the use of nanoparticles in cosmetics be conditional upon a favorable assessment by the relevant [[European Commission]] safety advisory committee.

The Woodrow Wilson Centre’s [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=topics.home&amp;topic_id=166192 Project on Emerging Technologies] conclude that there is insufficient funding for human health and safety research, and as a result there is currently limited understanding of the human health and safety risks associated with nanotechnology. While the US National Nanotechnology Initiative reports that around four percent (about $40 million) is dedicated to risk related research and development, the Woodrow Wilson Centre estimate that only around $11 million is actually directed towards risk related research. They argued in 2007 that it would be necessary to increase funding to a minimum of $50 million in the following two years so as to fill the gaps in knowledge in these areas.&lt;ref name="Issues"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|title=An Issues Landscape for Nanotechnology Standards. Report of a Workshop|url=http://ifas.msu.edu/NSWorkshopReport.pdf|publisher=Institute for Food and Agricultural Standards, Michigan State University, East Lansing|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511171215/http://ifas.msu.edu/NSWorkshopReport.pdf|archivedate=2008-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential for workplace exposure was highlighted by the 2004 Royal Society report which recommended a review of existing regulations to assess and control workplace exposure to nanoparticles and nanotubes. The report expressed particular concern for the inhalation of large quantities of nanoparticles by workers involved in the manufacturing process.&lt;ref name="Royal"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering|year=2004|title=Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties|url=http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm|accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stakeholders concerned by the lack of a regulatory framework to assess and control risks associated with the release of nanoparticles and nanotubes have drawn parallels with [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (‘mad cow’s disease'), [[thalidomide]], [[genetically modified food]], nuclear energy, reproductive technologies, biotechnology, and [[asbestosis]]. In light of such concerns, the Canadian-based [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]] have called for a moratorium on nano-related research until comprehensive regulatory frameworks are developed that will ensure workplace safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.etcgroup.org/issues/nanotechnology|title=Nanotechnology|work=ETC Group|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24768">'''Neo-Riemannian theory''' is a loose collection of ideas present in the writings of [[music theory|music theorists]] such as [[David Lewin]], Brian Hyer, [[Richard Cohn]], and [[Henry Klumpenhouwer]]. What binds these ideas is a central commitment to relating [[harmony|harmonies]] directly to each other, without necessary reference to a [[tonic (music)|tonic]]. Initially, those harmonies were [[major chord|major]] and [[minor chord|minor triads]]; subsequently, neo-Riemannian theory was extended to standard [[consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] sonorities as well. Harmonic proximity is characteristically gauged by efficiency of [[voice leading]]. Thus, C major and E minor triads are close by virtue of requiring only a single [[semitone|semitonal]] shift to move from one to the other. Motion between proximate harmonies is described by simple transformations. For example, motion between a C major and E minor triad, in either direction, is executed by an "L" transformation. Extended progressions of harmonies are characteristically displayed on a geometric plane, or map, which portrays the entire system of harmonic relations. Where consensus is lacking is on the question of what is most central to the theory: smooth voice leading, transformations, or the system of relations that is mapped by the geometries. The theory is often invoked when analyzing harmonic practices within the [[Romantic music#Late Romantic Era .281850-1910.29|Late Romantic]] period characterized by a high degree of [[chromaticism]], including work of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]].&lt;ref name="Cohn Intro"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohn |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Cohn |date=Autumn 1998 |title=An Introduction to Neo-Riemannian Theory: A Survey and Historical Perspective |journal=[[Journal of Music Theory]] |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=167–180 |jstor=843871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Minor as upside down major.png|thumb|right|350px|Illustration of Riemann's 'dualist' system: minor as upside down major.]]

Neo-Riemannian theory is named after [[Hugo Riemann]] (1849–1919), whose "dualist" system for relating triads was adapted from earlier 19th-century harmonic theorists. (The term "[[harmonic dualism|dualism]]" refers to the emphasis on the inversional relationship between major and minor, with minor triads being considered "upside down" versions of major triads; this "dualism" is what produces the change-in-direction described above. See also: [[Utonality]]) In the 1880s, Riemann proposed a system of transformations that related triads directly to each other &lt;ref name="Klumpenhouwer"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Klumpenhouwer |first=Henry |date=1994 |title=Some Remarks on the Use of Riemann Transformations |url=http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.94.0.9/mto.94.0.9.klumpenhouwer.art |journal=[[Music Theory Online]] |volume=0 |issue=9 |issn=1067-3040}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revival of this aspect of Riemann's writings, independently of the dualist premises under which they were initially conceived, originated with [[David Lewin]] (1933–2003), particularly in his article "Amfortas's Prayer to Titurel and the Role of D in Parsifal" (1984) and his influential book, ''Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations'' (1987). Subsequent development in the 1990s and 2000s has expanded the scope of neo-Riemannian theory considerably, with further mathematical systematization to its basic tenets, as well as inroads into 20th century repertoires and music psychology.&lt;ref name="Cohn Intro" /&gt;

==Triadic transformations and voice leading==

The principal transformations of neo-Riemannian triadic theory connect triads of different species (major and minor), and are their own [[inversion (music)|inverses]] (a second application undoes the first). These transformations are purely harmonic, and do not need any particular voice leading between chords: all instances of motion from a C major to a C minor triad represent the same neo-Riemannian transformation, no matter how the voices are distributed in register.

The three transformations move one of the three notes of the triad to produce a different triad:
*The '''P''' transformation exchanges a triad for its [[Parallel key|Parallel]]. In a Major Triad move the third down a semitone (C major to C minor), in a Minor Triad move the third up a semitone (C minor to C major)
*The '''R''' transformation exchanges a triad for its [[Relative key|Relative]]. In a Major Triad move the fifth up a tone (C major to A minor), in a Minor Triad move the root down a tone (A minor to C major)
*The '''L''' transformation exchanges a triad for its Leading-Tone Exchange. In a Major Triad the root moves down by a semitone (C major to E minor), in a Minor Triad the fifth moves up by a semitone (E minor to C major)

Observe that '''P''' preserves the ''perfect fifth'' interval (so given say C and G there are only two candidates for the third note: E and E{{flat}}), '''L''' preserves the ''minor third'' interval (given E and G our candidates are C and B) and '''R''' preserves the ''major third'' interval (given C and E our candidates are G and A).

Secondary operations can be constructed by combining these basic operations:

*The '''N''' (or ''Nebenverwandt'') relation exchanges a major triad for its minor [[subdominant]], and a minor triad for its major [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] (C major and F minor). The "N" transformation can be obtained by applying R, L, and P successively.&lt;ref name="Cohn Weitzmann"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohn |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Cohn |date=Spring 2000 |title=Weitzmann's Regions, My Cycles, and Douthett's Dancing Cubes |journal=[[Music Theory Spectrum]] |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=89–103 |doi=10.1525/mts.2000.22.1.02a00040 |jstor=745854 |via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''S''' (or ''Slide'') relation exchanges two triads that share a third (C major and C{{sharp}} minor); it can be obtained by applying L, P, and R successively in that order.&lt;ref name="Lewin"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations |last=Lewin |first=David |date=1987 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780199759941 |location=New Haven, CT |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''H''' relation (LPL) exchanges a triad for its hexatonic pole (C major and A{{flat}} minor)&lt;ref name="Cohn Hexatonic"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohn |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Cohn |date=Summer 2004 |title=Uncanny Resemblances: Tonal Signification in the Freudian Age |journal=[[Journal of the American Musicological Society]] |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=285–323 |doi=10.1525/jams.2004.57.2.285|jstor=10.1525/jams.2004.57.2.285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any combination of the L, P, and R transformations will act inversely on major and minor triads: for instance, R-then-P transposes C major down a minor third, to A major via A minor, whilst transposing C minor to E{{flat}} minor up a minor 3rd via E{{flat}} major.

Initial work in neo-Riemannian theory treated these transformations in a largely harmonic manner, without explicit attention to voice leading. Later, Cohn pointed out that neo-Riemannian concepts arise naturally when thinking about certain problems in voice leading.&lt;ref name="Cohn Maximal Smooth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tymoczko VL"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tymoczko |first=Dmitri |author-link=Dmitri Tymoczko |date=27 November 2008 |title=Scale Theory, Serial Theory, and Voice Leading |url=https://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/files/publications/scalesarrays.pdf |journal=[[Music Analysis (journal)|Music Analysis]] |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=1–49 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2249.2008.00257.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, two triads (major or minor) share two common tones and can be connected by stepwise voice leading the third voice if and only if they are linked by one of the L, P, R transformations described above.&lt;ref name="Cohn Maximal Smooth" /&gt; (This property of stepwise voice leading in a single voice is called [[voice-leading]] [[Occam's razor|parsimony]].) Note that here the emphasis on inversional relationships arises naturally, as a byproduct of interest in "parsimonious" voice leading, rather than being a fundamental theoretical postulate, as it was in Riemann's work.

More recently, [[Dmitri Tymoczko]] has argued that the connection between neo-Riemannian operations and voice leading is only approximate (see below).&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Distance"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mathematics and Computation in Music |last=Tymoczko |first=Dmitri |date=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-02394-1 |editor-last=Chew |editor-first=Elaine |series=Communications in Computer and Information Science |volume=38 |location=Heidelberg |pages=258–273 |chapter=Three Conceptions of Musical Distance |author-link=Dmitri Tymoczko |editor-last2=Childs |editor-first2=Adrian |editor-last3=Chuan |editor-first3=Ching-Hua |chapter-url=http://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/files/publications/distance.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the formalism of neo-Riemannian theory treats voice leading in a somewhat oblique manner: "neo-Riemannian transformations," as defined above, are purely harmonic relationships that do not necessarily involve any particular mapping between the chords' notes.&lt;ref name="Tymoczko VL" /&gt;

== Graphical representations ==
[[File:Neo-Riemannian Tonnetz.svg|thumb|500px|Pitches in the Tonnetz are connected by lines if they are separated by minor third, major third, or perfect fifth. Interpreted as a torus the Tonnetz has 12 nodes (pitches) and 24 triangles (triads).]]

Neo-Riemannian transformations can be modeled with several interrelated geometric structures. The Riemannian [[Tonnetz]] ("tonal grid," shown on the right) is a planar array of pitches along three simplicial axes, corresponding to the three consonant intervals. Major and minor triads are represented by triangles which tile the plane of the Tonnetz. Edge-adjacent triads share two common pitches, and so the principal transformations are expressed as minimal motion of the Tonnetz. Unlike the historical theorist for which it is named, neo-Riemannian theory typically assumes enharmonic equivalence (G{{sharp}} = A{{flat}}), which wraps the planar graph into a [[torus]].

[[File:TonnetzTorus.gif|thumb|One toroidal view of the neo-Riemannian Tonnetz.]]

Alternate tonal geometries have been described in neo-Riemannian theory that isolate or expand upon certain features of the classical Tonnetz. [[Richard Cohn]] developed the Hyper [[hexatonic scale|Hexatonic]] system to describe motion within and between separate major third cycles, all of which exhibit what he formulates as "maximal smoothness." (Cohn, 1996).&lt;ref name="Cohn Maximal Smooth"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohn |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Cohn |date=March 1996 |title=Maximally Smooth Cycles, Hexatonic Systems, and the Analysis of Late-Romantic Triadic Progressions |journal=[[Music Analysis (journal)|Music Analysis]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=9–40 |jstor=854168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another geometric figure, Cube Dance, was invented by Jack Douthett; it features the geometric dual of the Tonnetz, where triads are vertices instead of triangles (Douthett and Steinbach, 1998) and are interspersed with augmented triads, allowing smoother voice-leadings.

Many of the geometrical representations associated with neo-Riemannian theory are unified into a more general framework by the continuous voice-leading spaces explored by Clifton Callender, Ian Quinn, and Dmitri Tymoczko. This work originates in 2004, when Callender described a continuous space in which points represented three-note "chord types" (such as "major triad"), using the space to model "continuous transformations" in which voices slid continuously from one note to another.&lt;ref name="Callender MTO"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Callender |first=Clifton |date=2004 |title=Continuous Transformations |journal=Music Theory Online |volume=10 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Tymoczko showed that paths in Callender's space were isomorphic to certain classes of voice leadings (the "individually T related" voice leadings discussed in Tymoczko 2008) and developed a family of spaces more closely analogous to those of neo-Riemannian theory. In Tymoczko's spaces, points represent particular chords of any size (such as "C major") rather than more general chord types (such as "major triad").&lt;ref name="Tymoczko VL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Geometry"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tymoczko |first=Dmitri |author-link=Dmitri Tymoczko |date=2006 |title=The Geometry of Musical Chords |url=http://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/voiceleading.pdf |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=313 |pages=72–74 |pmid=16825563 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307073427/http://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/voiceleading.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Callender, Quinn, and Tymoczko together proposed a unified framework connecting these and many other geometrical spaces representing diverse range of music-theoretical properties.&lt;ref name="CQT"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Callender |first=Clifton |last2=Quinn |first2=Ian |last3=Tymoczko |first3=Dmitri |author-link3=Dmitri Tymoczko |title=Generalized Voice Leading Spaces |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=320 |pages=346–348|doi=10.1126/science.1153021|date=18 Apr 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Neo-Riemannian theorists often analyze chord progressions as combinations of the three basic LPR transformations, the only ones that preserve two common tones. 
Thus the progression from C major to E major might be analyzed as L-then-P, which is a 2-unit motion since it involves two transformations. (This same transformation sends C minor to A{{flat}} minor, since L of C minor is A{{flat}} major, while P of A{{flat}} major is A{{flat}} minor.) These distances reflect voice-leading only imperfectly.&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Distance" /&gt; For example, according to strains of neo-Riemannian theory that prioritize common-tone preservation, the C major triad is closer to F major than to F minor, since C major can be transformed into F major by R-then-L, while it takes three moves to get from C major to F minor (R-then-L-then-P). However, from a chromatic voice-leading perspective F minor is closer to C major than F major is, since it takes just two semitones of motion to transform F minor into C major (A{{flat}}-&gt;G and F-&gt;E) whereas it takes three semitones to transform F major into C major. Thus LPR transformations are unable to account for the voice-leading efficiency of the IV-iv-I progression, one of the basic routines of nineteenth-century harmony.&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Distance" /&gt; Note that similar points can be made about common tones: on the Tonnetz, F minor and E{{flat}} minor are both three steps from C major, even though F minor and C major have one common tone, while E{{flat}} minor and C major have none.

Underlying these discrepancies are different ideas about whether harmonic proximity is maximized when two common tones are shared, or when the total voice-leading distance is minimized. For example, in the R transformation, a single voice moves by whole step; in the N or S transformation, two voices move by semitone. When common-tone maximization is prioritized, R is more efficient; when voice-leading efficiency is measured by summing the motions of the individual voices, the transformations are equivalently efficient. Early neo-Riemannian theory conflated these two conceptions. More recent work has disentangled them, and measures distance unilaterally by voice-leading proximity independently of common-tone preservation. Accordingly, the distinction between "primary" and "secondary" transformations becomes problematized. As early as 1992, Jack Douthett created an exact geometric model of inter-triadic voice-leading by interpolating augmented triads between R-related triads, which he called "Cube Dance".&lt;ref name="Douthett"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Douthett |first=Jack |last2=Steinbach |first2=Peter |date=1998 |title=Parsimonious Graphs: A Study in Parsimony, Contextual Transformation, and Modes of Limited Transposition |url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/mod/resource/view.php?id=2314278 |journal=[[Journal of Music Theory]] |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=241–263 |doi=10.2307/843877 |jstor=843877}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Douthett's figure was published in 1998, its superiority as a model of voice leading was not fully appreciated until much later, in the wake of the geometrical work of Callender, Quinn, and Tymoczko; indeed, the first detailed comparison of "Cube Dance" to the neo-Riemannian "Tonnetz" appeared in 2009, more than fifteen years after Douthett's initial discovery of his figure.&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Distance" /&gt; In this line of research, the triadic transformations lose the foundational status that they held in the early phases of neo-Riemannian theory. The geometries to which voice-leading proximity give rise attain central status, and the transformations become heuristic labels for certain kinds of standard routines, rather than their defining property.

Nonetheless, among all possible sets of the twenty-four Riemannian triadic transformations, the length of combinations of members from the set of L, P, and R transformations better correlates with chromatic voice-leading distance than nearly every other set of transformations. For example, if only L and R transformations were used to measure transformational distance between triads, the number of contradictions between transformational distance and voice-leading distance like those examples above is much greater than when using L, P, and R. This partially restores some distinction between "primary" and "secondary" transformations.&lt;ref name="MurphyReview"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Murphy |first=S. |date=1 April 2014 |title=Audacious Euphony: Chromaticism and the Triad's Second Nature |journal=[[Journal of Music Theory]] |language=en |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=79–101 |doi=10.1215/00222909-2413598 |issn=0022-2909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extensions ==

Beyond its application to triadic chord progressions, neo-Riemannian theory has inspired numerous subsequent investigations. These include

*Voice-leading proximity among chords with more than three tones- among species of [[hexachord]]s, such as the [[Mystic chord]] (Callender, 1998)&lt;ref name="Callender"&gt;Callender, Clifton, "Voice-Leading Parsimony in the Music of Alexander Scriabin", ''Journal of Music Theory'' 42/2 (1998), 219–233&lt;/ref&gt;
* Common-tone proximity among dissonant trichords &lt;ref name="Siciliano"&gt;Siciliano, Michael, "Toggling Cycles, Hexatonic Systems, and Some Analysis of Early Atonal Music", ''Music Theory Specturm'' 27/2 (2005), 221–247&lt;/ref&gt;
*Progressions among triads within diatonic rather than chromatic space.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
*Transformations among scales of various sizes and species (in the work of [[Dmitri Tymoczko]]).&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Scales"&gt;Tymoczko, Dmitri. "Scale Networks and Debussy," ''Journal of Music Theory'' 48/2 (2004): : 215–92.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Transformations among all possible triads, not necessarily strict mode-shifting [[Involution (mathematics)|involutions]] ([[Julian Hook|Hook]], 2002).&lt;ref name="Hook 1"&gt;Hook, Julian, "Uniform Triadic Transformations", ''Journal of Music Theory'' 46/1–2 (2002), 57–126&lt;/ref&gt;
*Transformations between chords of differing cardinality, called ''cross-type transformations'' (Hook, 2007).&lt;ref name="Hook 2"&gt;Hook, Julian, "Cross-Type Transformations and the Path Consistency Condition", ''Music Theory Spectrum'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Applicability to [[popular music|pop music]].&lt;ref name="Capuzzo"&gt;Capuzzo, Guy, "Neo-Riemannian Theory and the Analysis of Pop-Rock Music", ''Music Theory Spectrum'' 26/2 2004), Pages 177–200&lt;/ref&gt;
*Applicability to [[film music]].&lt;ref name="Murphy 1"&gt;Murphy, Scott, "The Major Tritone Progression in Recent Hollywood Science Fiction Films," ''Music Theory Online'' 12/2 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lehman"&gt;Lehman, Frank, "Transformational Analysis and the Representation of Genius in Film Music," ''Music Theory Spectrum'', 35/1 (2013), 1–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphy 2"&gt;Murphy, Scott, "Transformational Theory and the Analysis of Film Music," in ''The Oxford Handbook of Film Music Studies'', ed. David Neumeyer, 471–499. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these extensions share neo-Riemannian theory's concern with non-traditional relations among familiar tonal chords; others apply voice-leading proximity or harmonic transformation to characteristically atonal chords.

'''Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority''' ({{lang-no|Statens strålevern}}, abbreviated to '''NRPA''') is a Norwegian public agency under the [[Ministry of Health and Care Services (Norway)|Ministry of Health and Care Services]] headquartered in [[Østerås (Bærum)|Østerås]], [[Bærum|Bærum municipality]], [[Greater Oslo Region]]. It works as an authority in the area of [[radiation protection]] and [[nuclear safety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keus|first=Andreas|title=Statens strålevern|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/hod/dep/underliggende-etater/statens-stalevern.html?id=279760|work=Helse- og Omsorgsdepartementet|publisher=Regjeringen.no|accessdate=9 October 2012|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NRPA fall under the Ministry of Health and Care Services, but serves all ministries and departments on issues relating to radiation.

==History==
The NRPA was created on January 1, 1993 through the consolidation of the former '''Nuclear Energy Safety Authority''' with the '''National institute of Radiation Hygiene'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norsk samfunnsvitenskapelig datatjeneste|title=Statens strålevern|url=http://www.nsd.uib.no/polsys/data/forvaltning/enhet/7822/endringshistorie|work=Endringshistorie|publisher=Nsd.no|accessdate=9 October 2012|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The NRPA is responsible for: overseeing the use of radioactive substances and fissile material, coordinating contingency plans against nuclear accidents and radioactive fallout, monitoring natural and artificial radiation in the environment and at the workplace, increasing our knowledge of the occurrence as well as monitoring risk and effects of radiation. It has regional offices in [[Tromsø]] and [[Sør-Varanger]] and is divided into three sections:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority|title=About the NRPA|url=http://www.nrpa.no/eway/default.aspx?pid=240&amp;trg=Main_6342&amp;Main_6342=6394:0:15,6230:1:0:0:::0:0|publisher=Nrpa.no|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Department of Emergency Preparedness and Environmental Radioactivity
*Department of Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety
*Department of Planning and Administration
==International cooperation==
NRPA is involved in extensive international cooperation. This includes cooperation on standards of management, but also a growing collaboration on [[research]] across borders. NRPA cooperates with [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP), and [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority|title=International Cooperation|url=http://www.nrpa.no/eway/default.aspx?pid=240&amp;trg=Center_6393&amp;Main_6342=6394:0:15,6232:1:0:0:::0:0&amp;CenterAndRight_6394=6393:0:15,6257:1:0:0:::0:0&amp;Center_6393=6401:83566::1:6442:1:::0:0|work=About NRPA|publisher=Nrpa.no|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6672">The '''numerical response''' in [[ecology]] is the change in [[predator]] density as a function of change in prey density. The term numerical response was coined by M. E. Solomon in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, M. E. "The Natural Control of Animal Populations." Journal of Animal Ecology. 19.1 (1949). 1-35&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with the [[functional response]], which is the change in predator's rate of prey consumption with change in prey density. As Holling notes, total predation can be expressed as a combination of functional and numerical response.&lt;ref&gt;Holling, C. S. "The components of predation as revealed by a study of small-mammal predation of the European pine sawfly." Canadian Entomologist 91: 293-320. (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; The numerical response has two mechanisms: the '''demographic response''' and the '''aggregational response'''. The numerical response is not necessarily proportional to the change in prey density, usually resulting in a time lag between prey and predator populations.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs, R. E. The Economy of Nature. 6th Edition. New York: Freeman and Company. 2010. p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is often a scarcity of predators when the prey population is increasing.

== Demographic response ==

The demographic response consists of changes in the rates of predator reproduction or survival due to a changes in prey density. The increase in prey availability translates into higher energy intake and reduced energy output. This is different from an increase in energy intake due to increased foraging efficiency, which is considered a functional response. This concept can be articulated in the [[Lotka-Volterra]] Predator-Prey Model.

&lt;math&gt;dP/dt = acVP-mP&lt;/math&gt;

a = conversion efficiency: the fraction of prey energy assimilated by the predator and turned into new predators&lt;br /&gt;
P = predator density&lt;br /&gt;
V = prey density&lt;br /&gt;
m = predator mortality

Demographic response consists of a change in dP/dt due to a change in V and/or m. For example, if V increases, then predator growth rate (dP/dt) will increase. Likewise if the energy intake increases (due to greater food availability) and a decrease in energy output (from foraging), then predator mortality (m) will decrease and predator growth rate (dP/dt) will increase. In contrast, the functional response consists of a change in conversion efficiency (a) or capture rate (c).

The relationship between available energy and reproductive efforts can be explained with the [[Biological life cycle|life history]] theory in the trade-off between fecundity and growth/survival. If an organism has more net energy, then the organism will sacrifice less energy dedicated to survival per reproductive effort and will therefore increase its reproduction rate.

In [[parasitism]], functional response is measured by the rate of infection or laying of eggs in host, rather than the rate of prey consumption as it is measured in predation.  Numerical response in parasitism is still measured by the change in number of adult parasites relative to change in host density.  Parasites can demonstrate a more pronounced numerical response to changes in host density since there is often a more direct connection (less time lag) between food and reproduction in that both needs are immediately satisfied by its interaction with the host.&lt;ref&gt;Holling, C. S. "The components of predation as revealed by a study of small-mammal predation of the European pine sawfly." Canadian Entomologist 91: 293-320.(1959)&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Aggregational response ==

The aggregational response, as defined by Readshaw in 1973, is a change in predator population due to immigration into an area with increased prey population.&lt;ref&gt;Readshaw, J.L. The numerical response of predators to prey density. In: Hughes, Ed., Quantitative Evaluation of Natural Enemy Effectiveness. J. Applied Biol. 10:342-351. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; In an experiment conducted by Turnbull in 1964, he observed the consistent migration of spiders from boxes without prey to boxes with prey. He proved that hunger impacts predator movement.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, A. L. The search for prey by a web-building spider Achaearanea tepidariorum (C. L. Koch) (Araneae, Theridiidae). Canadian Entomologist 96: 568-579. 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riechert and Jaeger studied how predator competition interferes with the direct correlation between prey density and predator immigration.&lt;ref&gt;Riechert, Susan E. Thoughts on Ecological Significance of Spiders. BioScience. 24(6): 352-356. 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, R.G. Competitive Exclusion: Comments on survival and extinction of species. BioScience. 24: 33-39. 1974&lt;/ref&gt; One way this can occur is through exploitation competition: the differential efficiency in use of available resources, for example, an increase in spiders' web size (functional response). The other possibility is interference competition where site owners actively prevent other foragers from coming in vicinity.

== Ecological relevance ==

The concept of numerical response becomes practically important when trying to create a strategy for [[pest control]]. The study of spiders as a biological mechanism for pest control has driven much of the research on aggregational response. Antisocial predator populations that display territoriality, such as spiders defending their web area, may not display the expected aggregational response to increased prey density.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, A. L. The search for prey by a web-building spider Achaearanea tepidariorum (C. L. Koch) (Araneae, Theridiidae). Canadian Entomologist 96: 568-579. 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

A credible, simple alternative to the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model and its common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or [[Arditi-Ginzburg equations|Arditi-Ginzburg model]].&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. 1989. [http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/ginzburglab/Coupling%20in%20Predator-Prey%20Dynamics%20-%20Arditi%20and%20Ginzburg,%201989.pdf Coupling in predator-prey dynamics: ratio dependence].  ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'' 139: 311-326.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models.  According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka-Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong.  They are much closer to the ratio dependent extreme, so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi-Ginzburg model as the first approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. 2012. ''How Species Interact: Altering the Standard View on Trophic Ecology''. Oxford University Press, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2019">'''Numerical taxonomy'''  is a [[Biological classification|classification system]] in biological [[systematics]] which deals with the grouping by [[numerical method]]s of [[taxon|taxonomic units]] based on their character states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=461900&amp;referURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d461900 |title=Numerical Taxonomy (biology) |author= |date= |work=www.accessscience.com |publisher=McGraw Hill Ltd. |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to create a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] using numeric algorithms like [[cluster analysis]] rather than using subjective evaluation of their properties. The concept was first developed by [[Robert R. Sokal]] and [[Peter H. A. Sneath]] in 1963&lt;ref&gt;Sokal &amp; Sneath: ''Principles of Numerical Taxonomy'', San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; and later elaborated by the same authors.&lt;ref&gt;Sneath and Sokal: ''Numerical Taxonomy'', San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; They divided the field into [[phenetics]] in which classifications are formed based on the patterns of overall similarities and [[cladistics]] in which classifications are based on the branching patterns of the estimated evolutionary history of the taxa.{{cn span|In recent years many authors treat numerical taxonomy and phenetics as synonyms despite the distinctions made by those authors.|date=May 2017}}

Although intended as an objective method, in practice the choice and implicit or explicit [[weighting]] of characteristics is influenced by available data and research interests of the investigator. What was made objective was the introduction of explicit steps to be used to create [[dendrogram]]s and [[cladogram]]s using numerical methods rather than subjective synthesis of data.

Leonardi moved to UCSB to found the [[Technology Management Program]] and start its [[Master of Technology Management]] and Ph.D. programs. Before joining UCSB, Leonardi was a faculty member in the School of Communication, the McCormick School of Engineering, and the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

Leonardi’s research focuses on how companies can design their organizational networks and implement new technologies to more effectively create and share knowledge. He is particularly interested in how data intensive technologies, such as simulation and social media tools, enable new ways to access, store, and share information; how the new sources of information these technologies provide can change work routines and communication partners; and how shifts in employees’ work and communication alter the nature of an organization's expertise. His work on these topics cuts across the fields of [[Organization Studies]], [[Communication Studies]], and [[Information Systems]] and has been published in leading journals in these fields, such as ''[[Academy of Management Journal]]'', ''[[Academy of Management Review]]'', ''[[Journal of Communication]]'', ''[[Human Communication Research]]'', ''[[Information Systems Research]]'',  ''[[MIS Quarterly]]'', and ''[[Organization Science (journal)|Organization Science]].'' He is also the author of three books ''[[Car Crashes Without Cars: Lessons About Simulation Technology and Organizational Change from Automotive Design]]'' (2012, MIT Press), ''[[Materiality and Organizing: Social Interaction in a Technological World]]''(2012, Oxford University Press), and ''[[Technology Choices: Why Occupations Differ in Their Embrace of New Technologies]]'' (2015, MIT Press).

'''Poles Coppice countryside site''' is an area of ancient oak woodland with disused quarry workings, located around {{convert|0.5|mi|km|0}} south of [[Pontesbury]], [[Shropshire]]. It is managed by [[Shropshire Council]] as a picnic spot and area for walking and recreation activities.

== Location and wildlife ==
Extending to around {{convert|21|ha|acre|0}}, Poles Coppice consists of two historic hard rock quarries and ancient woodland.  It has acid grassland and marshy areas within the quarries and further areas of wet woodland, which help to support a range of protected species, including bats, [[badger]]s and [[peregrine falcon]]. Further species recorded at the site in a [[Natural England]] survey include [[European polecat|polecat]], [[Grayling (butterfly)|grayling butterfly]] and [[spotted flycatcher]]. [[Common spotted orchid]] has been found in the main quarry and other notable woodland plants in the area include [[Hyacinthoides non-scripta|bluebell]], [[soft shield fern]] and a wide range of [[bryophyte]]s.&lt;ref name="management"&gt;Shropshire Council [http://shropshire.gov.uk/media/266303/poles-coppice-management-plan-2010.pdf “Poles Coppice Countryside Site Management Plan”].

== Management ==
The area is managed by Shropshire Council which aims to conserve the woodland as a habitat for bats and breeding birds, and to also improve the quarry areas to support notable flora and fauna. Other targets include improving the visibility of the geological aspects of the site around the quarry.&lt;ref name="management"/&gt; Circular walks are present on site, and currently offer views of Pontesbury and the [[Rea Brook|Rea Valley]].

Wildlife work at Poles Coppice has been planned by the Countryside Service, and includes clearing geologically significant rock faces to improve conditions for ground flora and, potentially, [[Vipera berus|adder]] populations.&lt;ref name="natural"&gt;Natural Shropshire [http://www.naturalshropshire.org.uk/?TabId=68 "Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund - Biodiversity Action in Shropshire"].

'''Reproductive toxicity''' is a hazard associated with some [[chemical substance]]s, that they will interfere in some way with normal [[reproduction]]; such substances are called '''reprotoxic'''. It includes adverse effects on sexual function and fertility in adult males and females, as well as developmental toxicity in the offspring.&lt;ref name="CLP"&gt;Annex I, section 3.7, [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:353:0001:1355:EN:PDF Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.] ''[[Official Journal of the European Communities|OJEC]]'', L353, 31.12.2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–1355, at pp.&amp;nbsp;107–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GHS"&gt;{{GHS|part=3|chapter=3.7|pages=175–86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IPCS"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = [[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] | title = Principles For Evaluating Health Risks To Reproduction Associated With Exposure To Chemicals | journal = Environmental Health Criteria | volume = 225 | url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc225.htm | location = Geneva | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | year = 2001 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usual to take a practical definition, including several different effects which are unrelated to each other except in their outcome of lowered effective fertility.&lt;ref name="IPCS" /&gt; The [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS) separates reproductive toxicity from [[germ cell]] [[mutagen]]icity and [[carcinogen]]icity, even though both these hazards may also affect fertility.&lt;ref name="GHS" /&gt;

One well known group of substances which are toxic for reproduction are [[teratogen]]s – substances which cause birth defects – of which [[Thalidomide|(''S'')-thalidomide]] is possibly the most notorious. Another group of substances which have received much attention (and some controversy) as possibly toxic for reproduction are the so-called [[endocrine disruptor]]s.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{Cite document | title = Global assessment of the state-of-the-science of endocrine disruptors | author = [[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva | url = http://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/new_issues/endocrine_disruptors/en/ | year = 2002 | id = WHO/PCS/EDC/02.2 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many substances which are toxic for reproduction do not fall into either of these groups: [[lead]] compounds, for example, are considered to be toxic for reproduction&lt;ref name="Annex1"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:152:0001:0311:EN:PDF Commission Directive 2004/73/EC of 29 August 2004 adapting to technical progress for the 29th time Council Directive 67/548/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances.] ''[[Official Journal of the European Communities|OJEC]]'' L152, 30.04.2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–311 (index no. 082-001-00-6).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CLPlead"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:353:0001:1355:EN:PDF Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.] ''[[Official Journal of the European Communities|OJEC]]'' L353, 31.12.2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–1355 at p.&amp;nbsp;444 (index no. 082-001-00-6).&lt;/ref&gt; given their adverse effects on the normal intellectual and psychomotor development of human babies and children.

Many drugs have effects on the [[human reproductive system]]: these may be desired ([[hormonal contraception]]), a minor unwanted side effect (many [[antidepressant]]s) or a major public health problem (thalidomide). However, most studies of reproductive toxicity has focused on occupational or environmental exposure to chemicals and their effects on reproduction. It may be noted that both consumption of alcohol and tobacco smoking are known to be "toxic for reproduction" in the sense that the term is used here.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is an example of an endocrine disruptor which negatively affects reproductive development. BPA is a known as estrogen mimicker (Xenoestrogen) and a likely androgen mimicker, which is used in the production of various plastic products. BPA exposure in fetal female rats lead to mammary gland morphogenesis, increased formation of ovarian tumors, and increased risk of developing mammary gland neoplasia in adult life. Additionally, BPA affects male fertility by resulting in lower sperm quality and sex function. The toxicological impact of BPA is better understood and studied in females than in males.&lt;ref&gt;Jones BA, Wagner LS, Watson NV (March 2016). “The Effects of Bisphenol A Exposure at Different Developmental Time Points in an Androgen-Sensitive Neuromuscular System in Male Rats”. Endocrinology. 157 (8): 2972-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Soto AM, Sonnenschein C (2010). "Environmental Causes of Cancer: Endocrine Disruptors as Carcinogens". Nature Reviews Endocrinology. 6 (7): 363–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rochester, JR (December 2013). "Bisphenol A and human health: a review of the literature". Reproductive Toxicology. 42: 132–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead is a heavy metal that not only has been associated with mental deficits, but male infertility and male reproductive issues. Lead is believed to predominantly affect male reproduction via disruption of hormones. Through this hormonal disruption, the process of sperm production in the seminiferous tubules is reduced. Another proposed mechanism of poor semen quality due to lead exposure has been attributed to lead’s ability to cause increases in reactive oxygen species due to lipid peroxidation, leading to cellular damage.&lt;ref&gt;Vigeh M, Smith DR, Hsu P-C. How does lead induce male fertility? Iranian Journal of Reproductive Medicine. 2011; 9(1):1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorostghoal, M., Seyyednejad, S.M., Jabari, A. (2014). Protective effects of Fumaria parviflora L. on lead-induced testicular toxicity in male rates. Andrologia, 46(4), 437-446.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reproductive toxins such as Thalidomide were once prescribed and used for therapeutic effects. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Thalidomide was widely used in Europe as an anti-nausea medication to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women. It wasn't until the 1960s  was found that Thalidomide altered embryo development and led to limb deformities such as thumb absence, under development of entire limbs, or phocomelia. The teratogenic effects of Thalidomide have been proposed to affect more that ten thousand babies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Kim JH, Scialli AR. Thalidomide: the tragedy of birth defects and the effective treatment of disease. Toxicol Sci. 2012 Feb;125(2):613.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Frias ML. The thalidomide experience: review of its effects 50 years later. 2012 Jun 2;139(1):25-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diethylstilbestrol (DES), a synthetic estrogen known to be another reproductive toxin, was used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent spontaneous abortions from occurring in women. DES causes carcinogenic and mutagenic effects via the production of highly reactive metabolites, furthermore resulting in the formation of DNA adducts. Individuals exposed to DES in utero suffer atypical reproductive tract formation. Specifically, females exposed, in utero, to DES during the first trimester have an increased risk of developing clear cell vaginal carcinoma, and males an increased risk of hypospadias.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Klip, MPH, Janneke Verloop, MSc, Jan D van Gool, MD, Marlies ETA Koster, MSc, Prof Curt W Burger, MD, Prof Flora E van Leeuwen, MD, for the OMEGA project group.(2002, March 30) Hypospadias in sons of women exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero: a cohort study.

==Background==
Rock mechanics forms part of the much broader subject of [[geomechanics]], which is concerned with the mechanical responses of all geological materials, including soils. Rock mechanics, as applied in [[engineering geology]], [[mining]], petroleum, and [[civil engineering]] practice, is concerned with the application of the principles of [[Applied mechanics|engineering mechanics]] to the design of the rock structures generated by mining, drilling, reservoir production, or civil construction activity such as [[tunnels]], mining shafts, underground excavations, open pit mines, [[oil well|oil and gas wells]], road cuts, waste repositories, and other structures built in or of rock.  It also includes the design of reinforcement systems, such as [[rock bolt]]ing patterns.

Rock mechanics is a theoretical and applied science of the mechanical behavior of rock and rock masses; it is that branch of mechanics concerned with the response of rock and rock masses to the force fields of their physical environment. Rock mechanics is concerned with the application of the principles of engineering mechanics to the design of structures built in or of rock. The structure could include-but not limited to- a drill hole, a mining shaft, a tunnel, a reservoir dam, a repository component, or a building.  Rock mechanics is used in many engineering disciplines, but primarily used in Mining, Civil, Geotechnical, Transportation, and Petroleum Engineering.

The term has also been used less formally:

== History ==
{{Main|History of software engineering}}

When the first digital [[computer]]s appeared in the early 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Leondes |first= Cornelius T. |title= Intelligent Systems: Technology and Applications|year=2002| publisher=CRC Press| ISBN =978-0-8493-1121-5 | quote = 1.4 Computers and a First Glimpse at Al (1940s) | page = I-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the instructions to make them operate were wired into the machine. Practitioners quickly realized that this design was not flexible and came up with the "stored program architecture" or [[von Neumann architecture]]. Thus the division between "hardware" and "software" began with [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] being used to deal with the complexity of computing.

[[Programming language]]s started to appear in the early 1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Campbell-Kelly |first1=Martin |title=The Development of Computer Programming in Britain (1945 to 1955) |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |date=April 1982 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=121–139 |doi=10.1109/MAHC.1982.10016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was also another major step in abstraction. Major languages such as [[Fortran]], [[ALGOL]], and [[COBOL]] were released in the late 1950s to deal with scientific, algorithmic, and business problems respectively. [[David Parnas]] introduced the key concept of [[modularity]] and [[information hiding]] in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parnas|first=David|authorlink=David Parnas|journal=[[Communications of the ACM]]|volume=15|issue=12|pages=1053–1058|url=http://www.acm.org/classics/may96/|title=On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules|date=December 1972|accessdate=2008-12-26|doi=10.1145/361598.361623}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help programmers deal with the ever-increasing complexity of [[software systems]].

The origins of the term "software engineering" have been attributed to various sources. The term "software engineering" appeared in a list of services offered by companies in the June 1965 issue of [http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/computersAndAutomation/196506.pdf COMPUTERS and AUTOMATION] and was used more formally in the August 1966 issue of Communications of the ACM (Volume 9, number 8) “letter to the ACM membership” by the ACM President Anthony A. Oettinger;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1984, the [[Software Engineering Institute]] (SEI) was established as a federally funded research and development center headquartered on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. [[Watts Humphrey]] founded the SEI Software Process Program, aimed at understanding and managing the software engineering process.  The Process Maturity Levels introduced would become the Capability Maturity Model Integration for Development(CMMI-DEV), which has defined how the US Government evaluates the abilities of a software development team.

Modern, generally accepted best-practices for software engineering have been collected by the [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7]] subcommittee and published as the [[Software Engineering Body of Knowledge]] (SWEBOK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33897|title=ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005|accessdate=2012-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subdisciplines ==
Software engineering can be divided into sub-disciplines.&lt;ref name="swebookv3"&gt;{{cite web |title=Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK Version 3), 2014|url=https://www.computer.org/web/swebok/v3|website=www.swebok.org|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|accessdate=24 May 2016|ref=swebookv3|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them are:
* [[Software requirements]]&lt;ref name="BoDu04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; (or [[Requirements engineering]]): The elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation of [[requirements]] for [[software]].
* [[Software design]]:&lt;ref name="BoDu04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; The process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or component. It is also defined as the result of that process.
* [[Software construction]]:&lt;ref name="BoDu04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; The detailed creation of working, meaningful software through a combination of [[Computer programming|programming]] (aka coding), verification, [[unit testing]], [[integration testing]], and [[debugging]].
* [[Software testing]]:&lt;ref name="BoDu04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; An empirical, technical investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test.
* [[Software maintenance]]:&lt;ref name="BoDu04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; The totality of activities required to provide cost-effective support to software.
* [[Software configuration management]]:&lt;ref name="BoDu04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; The identification of the configuration of a system at distinct points in time for the purpose of systematically controlling changes to the configuration, and maintaining the integrity and traceability of the configuration throughout the system life cycle. Modern processes use [[software versioning]].
* [[Software engineering management]]:&lt;ref name="BoDu04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; The application of management activities—planning, coordinating, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and reporting—to ensure that the development and maintenance of software is systematic, disciplined, and quantified.
* [[Software development process]]:&lt;ref name="BoDu04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; The definition, implementation, assessment, measurement, management, change, and improvement of the software life cycle process itself.
* Software engineering models and methods&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; impose structure on software engineering with the goal of making that activity systematic, repeatable, and ultimately more success-oriented
* [[Software quality]]&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt;
* Software engineering professional practice&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; is concerned with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that software engineers must possess to practice software engineering in a professional, responsible, and ethical manner
* Software engineering economics&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; is about making decisions related to software engineering in a business context
* Computing foundations&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt;
* Mathematical foundations&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt;
* Engineering foundations&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt;

== Education ==
Knowledge of [[computer programming]] is a prerequisite for becoming a software engineer. In 2004 the [[IEEE Computer Society]] produced the [[SWEBOK]], which has been published as ISO/IEC Technical Report 1979:2004, describing the body of knowledge that they recommend to be mastered by a graduate software engineer with four years of experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = Abran |editor1-first= Alain | title = Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge | publisher = IEEE Computer Society | location = Los Alamitos |year= 2005 | isbn = 0-7695-2330-7 | url= http://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok |accessdate=2010-09-13|origyear= 2004|chapter= Chapter 1: Introduction to the Guide|chapter-url= http://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok/html/ch1 |quote= The total volume of cited literature is intended to be suitable for mastery through the completion of an undergraduate education plus four years of experience.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many software engineers enter the profession by obtaining a university degree or training at a vocational school. One standard international curriculum for undergraduate software engineering degrees was defined by the [[Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula]] of the [[IEEE Computer Society]] and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]], and updated in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/se2014.pdf |title=SE2014 Software Engineering Curriculum}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of universities have Software Engineering degree programs; {{As of|2010|lc=on}}, there were 244 Campus [[Bachelor of Software Engineering]] programs, 70 Online programs, 230 Masters-level programs, 41 Doctorate-level programs, and 69 Certificate-level programs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gradschools.com/search-programs/software-engineering] Degree programs in Software Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to university education, many companies sponsor internships for students wishing to pursue careers in information technology. These internships can introduce the student to interesting real-world tasks that typical software engineers encounter every day. Similar experience can be gained through [[military service]] in software engineering.

== Profession ==
{{Main|Software engineer|Software engineering professionalism}}

[[Legal]] requirements for the licensing or certification of professional software engineers vary around the world. In the UK, there is no licensing or legal requirement to assume or use the job title Software Engineer.  In some areas of Canada, such as Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = N.S.W. | last = Williams | title = Professional Engineers Ontario's approach to licensing software engineering practitioners | booktitle = Software Engineering Education and Training, 2001 Proceedings. 14th Conference on | pages = 77–78 | publisher = [[IEEE]]| date = 19–21 February 2001 | location = Charlotte, NC | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Quebec, software engineers can hold the Professional Engineer (P.Eng) designation and/or the Information Systems Professional (I.S.P.) designation. In Europe, Software Engineers can obtain the [[European Engineer]] (EUR ING) professional title.

The United States, since 2013, has offered an ''[[NCEES]]'' ''[[Professional Engineer]]'' exam for Software Engineering, thereby allowing Software Engineers to be licensed and recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cdn1.ncees.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Exam-specifications_PE-Software-Apr-2013.pdf| title = NCEES Software Engineering Exam Specifications| accessdate = 2012-04-01| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130827220334/http://cdn1.ncees.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Exam-specifications_PE-Software-Apr-2013.pdf| archivedate = 2013-08-27| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; NCEES will end the exam after April 2019 due to lack of participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NCEES discontinuing PE Software Engineering exam |url=https://ncees.org/ncees-discontinuing-pe-software-engineering-exam/ |publisher=National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying |date=13 March 2018 |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandatory licensing is currently still largely debated, and perceived as controversial. In some parts of the US such as Texas, the use of the term [[Engineer]] is regulated by law and reserved only for use by individuals who have a [[Professional Engineer]] license.

The [[IEEE Computer Society]] and the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]], the two main US-based professional organizations of software engineering, publish guides to the profession of software engineering. The IEEE's ''Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge - 2004 Version'', or [[SWEBOK]], defines the field and describes the knowledge the IEEE expects a practicing software engineer to have. The most current SWEBOK v3 is an updated version and was released in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computer.org/web/swebok/v3|title='SWEBOK Guide Version 3' |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IEEE also promulgates a "Software Engineering Code of Ethics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/Publications/code-of-ethics.pdf |title='&amp;#39;Software Engineering Code of Ethics'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment ===
The [[Bureau of Labor Statistics|U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]] counted 1,256,200 software Developers (Engineers) holding jobs in the [[United States|U.S.]] in 2016&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Employment of computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 13 percent from 2016 to 2026, faster than the average for all occupations. These occupations are projected to add about 557,100 new jobs. Demand for these workers will stem from greater emphasis on cloud computing, the collection and storage of big data, and information security&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Yet, the BLS also says some employment in these occupations are slowing and computer programmers is projected to decline 7 percent from 2016 to 2026 since computer programming can be done from anywhere in the world, so companies sometimes hire programmers in countries where wages are lower&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Due to its relative newness as a field of study, formal education in software engineering is often taught as part of a computer science curriculum, and many software engineers hold computer science degrees and have no engineering background whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=12|title=Software Engineering|accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many software engineers work as employees or contractors. Software engineers work with businesses, government agencies (civilian or military), and non-profit organizations. Some software engineers work for themselves as [[freelancer]]s. Some organizations have specialists to perform each of the tasks in the [[software development process]]. Other organizations require software engineers to do many or all of them. In large projects, people may specialize in only one role. In small projects, people may fill several or all roles at the same time. Specializations include: in industry ([[Requirements analysis|analysts]], [[Software architecture|architects]], [[Software developer|developers]], [[Software testing|testers]], [[technical support]], [[middleware analyst]]s, [[Project management|managers]]) and in academia ([[educator]]s, [[researcher]]s).

Most software engineers and programmers work 40 hours a week, but about 15 percent of software engineers and 11 percent of programmers worked more than 50 hours a week in 2008. Potential injuries in these occupations are possible because like other workers who spend long periods [[Sitting#Health_risks|sitting]] in front of a computer terminal typing at a keyboard, engineers and programmers are susceptible to eyestrain, back discomfort, and hand and wrist problems such as [[carpal tunnel syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos303.htm#training|title=Computer Software Engineers and Computer Programmers|accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Certification ===
The [[Software Engineering Institute]] offers certifications on specific topics like [[IT security|security]], process improvement and [[software architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sei.cmu.edu/certification/ |title=SEI certification page |publisher=Sei.cmu.edu |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Information Technology Architect Certification|IBM]], [[Microsoft Certified Professional|Microsoft]] and other companies also sponsor their own certification examinations. Many [[Information technology|IT]] [[Professional certification (computer technology)|certification]] programs are oriented toward specific technologies, and managed by the vendors of these technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1180991|title=The Top 10 Problems with IT Certification in 2008|last=Wyrostek|first=Warren |date=March 14, 2008|work=InformIT|accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; These certification programs are tailored to the institutions that would employ people who use these technologies.

Broader certification of general software engineering skills is available through various professional societies. {{As of|2006}}, the [[IEEE]] had certified over 575 software professionals as a [[Certified Software Development Professional]] (CSDP).&lt;ref name="ieee2006"&gt;{{cite web |author=IEEE Computer Society|url=http://www.ifip.org/minutes/GA2006/Tab18b-US-IEEE.pdf|format=PDF|title=2006 IEEE computer society report to the IFIP General Assembly|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 they added an entry-level certification known as the Certified Software Development Associate (CSDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=IEEE|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/certification/csda|title=CSDA|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] had a professional certification program in the early 1980s,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} which was discontinued due to lack of interest. The ACM examined the possibility of professional certification of software engineers in the late 1990s, but eventually decided that such certification was inappropriate for the professional industrial practice of software engineering.&lt;ref name="acm2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.wm.edu/~coppit/csci690-spring2004/papers/selep_main.pdf |title=A Summary of the ACM Position on Software Engineering as a Licensed Engineering Profession |last=ACM |date=July 17, 2000 |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) |accessdate=2009-03-03 |quote=At its meeting in May 2000, the Council further concluded that the framework of a licensed professional engineer, originally developed for civil engineers, does not match the professional industrial practice of software engineering. Such licensing practices would give false assurances of competence even if the body of knowledge were mature; and would preclude many of the most qualified software engineers from becoming licensed. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517201804/http://www.cs.wm.edu/~coppit/csci690-spring2004/papers/selep_main.pdf |archivedate=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.K. the [[British Computer Society]] has developed a legally recognized professional certification called ''Chartered IT Professional (CITP)'', available to fully qualified members (''MBCS''). Software engineers may be eligible for membership of the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] and so qualify for Chartered Engineer status. In Canada the [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] has developed a legally recognized professional certification called ''Information Systems Professional (ISP)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Canadian Information Processing Society|url=http://www.cips.ca/standards/isp|title=I.S.P. Designation|accessdate=2007-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ontario, Canada, Software Engineers who graduate from a ''Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB)'' accredited program, successfully complete PEO's (''Professional Engineers Ontario'') Professional Practice Examination (PPE) and have at least 48 months of acceptable engineering experience are eligible to be licensed through the ''Professional Engineers Ontario'' and can become Professional Engineers P.Eng.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peo.on.ca |title=Professional Engineers Ontario: Welcome to PEO's website |publisher=Peo.on.ca |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PEO does not recognize any online or distance education however; and does not consider Computer Science programs to be equivalent to software engineering programs despite the tremendous overlap between the two. This has sparked controversy and a certification war. It has also held the number of P.Eng holders for the profession exceptionally low. The vast majority of working professionals in the field hold a degree in CS, not SE. Given the difficult certification path for holders of non-SE degrees, most never bother to pursue the license.

=== Impact of globalization ===
The initial impact of outsourcing, and the relatively lower cost of international human resources in developing third world countries led to a massive migration of software development activities from corporations in North America and Europe to India and later: China, Russia, and other developing countries. This approach had some flaws, mainly the distance / timezone difference that prevented human interaction between clients and developers and the massive job transfer. This had a negative impact on many aspects of the software engineering profession. For example, some students in the [[developed world]] avoid education related to software engineering because of the fear of [[offshore outsourcing]] (importing software products or services from other countries) and of being displaced by [[Foreign Worker Visa|foreign visa workers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Patrick|last=Thibodaux|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2555175/it-careers/as-outsourcing-gathers-steam--computer-science-interest-wanes.html |title=As outsourcing gathers steam, computer science interest wanes |publisher=Computerworld.com |date=2006-05-05 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself; a related career, [[computer programming]] does appear to have been affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos110.htm#outlook |title=Computer Programmers |publisher=Bls.gov |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mullins |first=Robert |url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/03/13/HNslowsoftdev_1.html |title=Software developer growth slows in North America |publisher=InfoWorld |date=2007-03-13 |accessdate=2012-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404033214/http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/03/13/HNslowsoftdev_1.html |archivedate=2009-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the ability to smartly leverage offshore and near-shore resources via the [[follow-the-sun]] workflow has improved the overall operational capability of many organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cognizant.com/html/content/news/GartnerMQ_Cognizant.pdf |title=Gartner Magic Quadrant |publisher=Cognizant.com |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; When North Americans are leaving work, Asians are just arriving to work. When Asians are leaving work, Europeans are arriving to work. This provides a continuous ability to have human oversight on business-critical processes 24 hours per day, without paying overtime compensation or disrupting a key human resource, sleep patterns.

While global outsourcing has several advantages, global - and generally distributed - development can run into serious difficulties resulting from the distance between developers. This is due to the key elements of this type of distance that have been identified as geographical, temporal, cultural and communication (that includes the use of different languages and dialects of English in different locations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Casey |first=Valentine |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13173-010-0013-3 |title=Virtual software team project management|publisher=Springer |date=2010-08-20 |accessdate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has been carried out in the area of global software development over the last 15 years and an extensive body of relevant work published that highlights the benefits and problems associated with the complex activity. As with other aspects of software engineering research is ongoing in this and related areas.

== Controversy ==

=== Criticism ===
Software engineering sees its practitioners as individuals who follow well-defined engineering approaches to problem-solving. These approaches are specified in various software engineering books and research papers, always with the connotations of predictability, precision, mitigated risk and professionalism. This perspective has led to calls{{By whom|date=October 2018}} for licensing, certification and codified bodies of knowledge as mechanisms for spreading the engineering knowledge and maturing the field.

[[Software craftsmanship]] has been proposed by a body of software developers as an alternative that emphasizes the coding skills and accountability of the software developers themselves without professionalism or any prescribed curriculum leading to ad-hoc problem-solving (craftmanship) without engineering (lack of predictability, precision, missing risk mitigation, methods are informal and poorly defined). [http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/ The Software Craftsmanship Manifesto] extends the Agile Software Manifesto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agilemanifesto.org/|title=Manifesto for Agile Software Development |year=2001 |publisher=Agile Alliance|author=Beck, Kent |authorlink=Kent Beck|accessdate=14 June 2010|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and draws a metaphor between modern software development and the apprenticeship model of medieval Europe.

Software engineering extends engineering and draws on the engineering model, i.e. engineering process, engineering project management, engineering requirements, engineering design, engineering construction, and engineering validation. The concept is so new that it is rarely understood, and it is widely misinterpreted, including in software engineering textbooks, papers, and among the communities of programmers and crafters.

One of the core issues in software engineering is that its approaches are not empirical enough because a real-world validation of approaches is usually absent, or very limited and hence software engineering is often misinterpreted as feasible only in a "theoretical environment."

[[Edsger Dijkstra]], the founder of many of the concepts used within software development today, rejected the idea of "software engineering" up until his death in 2002, arguing that those terms were poor analogies for what
he called the "radical novelty" of [[computer science]]:

A number of these phenomena have been bundled under the name "Software Engineering". As economics is known as "The Miserable Science", software engineering should be known as "The Doomed Discipline", doomed because it cannot even approach its goal since its goal is self-contradictory.

===Sweet Briar plantation===
The college is named after the former plantation of [[Elijah Fletcher]] and his descendants. Fletcher was a 19th-century teacher, businessman and mayor of [[Lynchburg, Virginia]]. He married Maria Antoinette Crawford in 1813, and purchased the Sweet Briar plantation property from her aunt and uncle. The plantation was initially known as Locust Ridge; Crawford supposedly renamed it "Sweet Briar" after the roses which grew on the land. Their daughter, Indiana Fletcher, was born in 1828 in Lynchburg.

Indiana attended the [[Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School]], [[Doane Academy]], and later toured Europe with her brother and sister. She met [[J. Henry Williams|James Henry Williams]], a student at [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]] in 1858, and after reuniting in Virginia following the American Civil War, they were married in 1865. Their daughter, Maria Georgiana "Daisy" Williams, was born in 1867. At Elijah Fletcher's death, Indiana inherited the plantation. James Williams gave up his initial career as a clergyman to maintain the property. Daisy Williams died at the age of 16 in 1884. Both James and Indiana Fletcher-Williams were devastated at her death, and James expressed a wish in his own will that a school might be established in honor of Daisy. William died in 1889, leaving his entire estate to his wife, and Indiana's brother Sidney also gave her additional property upon his death in 1898. When Indiana died in 1900, she bequeathed Sweet Briar plantation to become a school for young women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stohlman|first1=Martha Lou Lemmon|title=The story of Sweet Briar College.|date=1956|publisher=Alumnae Association of Sweet Briar College}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fletcher-Williams Family|url=http://sbc.edu/museum/fletcher-williams-family|website=Sweet Briar College|publisher=Sweet Briar College museum|accessdate=31 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910102059/http://sbc.edu/museum/fletcher-williams-family|archivedate=10 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By his death in 1858, Elijah Fletcher owned over 110 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gore|first1=Sherese|title=The enslaved founders: Letters from 1800s reveal life on 'Sweetbrier' plantation|url=http://www.newsadvance.com/new_era_progress/news/the-enslaved-founders-letters-from-s-reveal-life-on-sweetbrier/article_f675b944-de21-11e4-b1ef-23f622d62746.html|website=New Era Progress – Amherst County|publisher=News Advance|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] in 1865, several former slaves and descendants of slaves continued to work for pay and live at Sweet Briar, including Martha Penn Taylor, who worked for three generations of the Fletcher-Williams family, and Signora Hollins (who was Indiana Fletcher's childhood playmate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African American Heritage at Sweet Briar|url=http://tusculum.sbc.edu/africanamericans/|website=African American Heritage at Sweet Briar College|publisher=Tusculum Institute at Sweet Briar College|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biographies|url=http://tusculum.sbc.edu/africanamericans/biographies_list.shtml|website=African American Heritage at Sweet Briar College|publisher=Tusculum Institute at Sweet Briar College|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some descendants of the slaves owned by the family still work at the college, and others hold family reunions on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Svrluga|first1=Susan|title=For a family whose ancestors were slaves at the Sweet Briar plantation, a loss|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/04/06/for-a-family-whose-ancestors-were-slaves-at-the-sweet-briar-plantation-a-loss/|accessdate=7 April 2015|agency=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indiana Fletcher Williams' bequest and official opening===
In 1901, with the assistance of then Virginia state senator [[Carter Glass]], the Virginia General Assembly issued a charter to Sweet Briar Institute as indicated in the will of Indiana Fletcher Williams. The will stated that the land of Sweet Briar plantation must be used as a "school or seminary to be known as the 'Sweet Briar institute,' for the education of white girls and young women. It shall be the general scope and object of the school to impart to its students such education in sound learning, and such physical, moral and religious training as shall, in the judgment of the directors, best fit them to be useful members of society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Archive.org|title=Copy of the Charter of Sweet Briar Institute and of the Amendments of Said Charter|url=https://archive.org/stream/copyofcharterofs00unse/copyofcharterofs00unse_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, Sweet Briar College officially opened with 51 students and granted its first AB degrees in 1910. In 1932, Sweet Briar's study abroad exchange program with the [[University of St. Andrews]], Scotland, was established. In 1948, the renowned Junior Year in France (JYF) program was launched, followed by a number of other study abroad programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SWEET BRIAR PLANS STUDY GROUP IN PARIS|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/108141973?accountid=9758|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=Jan 13, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://sbc.edu/about/history|website=Sbc.edu|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sweet Briar College JYF|url=http://www.jyf.sbc.edu/|website=Sbc.edu|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil Rights era changes===
Legal action to alter Indiana Fletcher Williams' will was required to admit African-American students, as it had limited the purpose of the college to the education of solely white women.&lt;ref name="ia700502.us.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abrams|first1=Mary Malyneux|title=Thank You Mr. Newman: Re-Interpreting the Will of Indiana Fletcher Williams|url=https://archive.org/details/alumnaemagazine722swee|website=Archive.org|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 17, 1964, wishing to eliminate "white" from the charter and comply with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], Sweet Briar filed a bill of complaint with the Amherst County Circuit Court. The request was initially denied at the state level, with the Commonwealth's Attorney General stating that the will was "plain, unambiguous, conclusive, and binding".

After several years of unsuccessful state litigation, the college filed a complaint with the federal [[United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia]]. On April 25, 1966, Judge [[Thomas J. Michie]] issued a temporary restraining order that prevented enforcement of the racial restriction. On July 17, 1967, a three-judge Charlottesville court confirmed permanence of the restraining order. The first African-American student, [[Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp]], was admitted to the college in September 1966.&lt;ref name="ia700502.us.archive.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sbc.edu/news/alumnae-and-development/change-long/ |title=A little change goes a long way &amp;#124; Sweet Briar College News |publisher=Sbc.edu |date=2013-06-14 |accessdate=2015-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the Supreme Court of the United States, October term 1966 : Sweet Briar Institute, appellant, v.

===2015 closure attempt===

====Pending closure announced by board====
On March 3, 2015, the college's board of directors, following a unanimous vote on February 28, 2015, announced the college would close on August 25, 2015, due to "insurmountable financial challenges". They cited declining enrollment and an endowment insufficient to cover potentially large-scale changes needed to boost enrollment, like coeducation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kapsidelis|first1=Karin |title=Sweet Briar College to close | url= http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/article_105c880d-25d1-5305-be18-8d5f08c50776.html| work =Richmond Times-Dispatch |accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible factor presented by the board was a declining interest in the traditional women's college model.&lt;ref&gt;dukechronicle.com, [http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2015/03/17/all-womens-colleges-face-challenges#.VQywB473-iy All women's colleges face challenges], March 17, 2015 (Retrieved 3-20-15)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The board announced that academic activity was to cease on August 25, 2015, the college’s pending closing date. Some professors said they received termination notices stating their last day of work would be May 30, 2015; the last day of employment for most was June 30, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;

Between 2011 and March 2015, Sweet Briar's endowment had dropped from $96.2 to $84 million, as the college drew on endowment for operating expenses.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Businessinsider.com_March_17_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sweet-briar-college-financials-2015-3 |title=Something just doesn't add up with an imploding college's financials  |newspaper=Business Insider |date= March 16, 2015 |author=Peter Jacobs |accessdate= March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the college's endowment is [[Financial endowment#Restricted endowments|restricted]], meaning the money must serve designated purposes, such as scholarships or faculty chairs.

On April 20, following the decision on the injunction, a group of Sweet Briar students, parents, and alumnae filed a third lawsuit calling the Board decision to close the school a breach of contract.

The Amherst County Attorney filed an appeal of the judge's April 15 decision on trust law applicability  with the Virginia Supreme Court.

====Agreement to keep the college open====
On June 20, 2015, the Virginia Attorney General's office announced a mediation agreement to keep Sweet Briar College open for the 2015–16 academic year.  The agreement called for Sweet Briar College president James Jones to resign, as well as at least 13 members of the college's board of directors to allow Saving Sweet Briar to appoint a new majority.&lt;ref name=open /&gt;&lt;ref name=mou /&gt; Lawyers for Saving Sweet Briar contacted Phillip Stone, the former president of [[Bridgewater College]], to ask him to serve as Sweet Briar's new president.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Chronicle.com_June_24_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Let-s-Make-This-Work-/231097/ |title=‘Let's Make This Work': Sweet Briar's New President Surveys the Task Ahead - Leadership &amp; Governance - The Chronicle of Higher Education |newspaper=Chronicle.com |date=June 23, 2015 |author=Steve Kolowich |accessdate=June 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624160942/http://chronicle.com/article/Let-s-Make-This-Work-/231097/ |archive-date=2015-06-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saving Sweet Briar agreed to contribute $12 million, and the state Attorney General agreed to release restrictions on an additional $16 million of endowment money, to pay for continuing operations.  On June 22, 2015, the Bedford County judge approved the agreement, and dismissed the pending lawsuits.&lt;ref name="MyUser_The_Washington_Post_June_22_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/06/22/sweet-briar-survives-judge-approves-settlement-deal-to-keep-the-college-open/ |title=Sweet Briar survives: Judge approves settlement deal to keep the college open |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 22, 2015  |author=Susan Svrluga |accessdate= June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revitalization===

====Change of leadership====
Sweet Briar's board is normally elected annually in the spring, however Saving Sweet Briar and plaintiffs in the litigations appointed an entirely new board in July 2015.&lt;ref name="transfer of power"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MyUser_Newsadvance.com_July_5_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsadvance.com/opinion/editorials/far-reaching-lessons-from-sweet-briar/article_df156124-19e9-11e5-8c06-2f747c63f0aa.html |title=Far-Reaching Lessons From Sweet Briar - NewsAdvance.com : Editorials |newspaper=Newsadvance.com |date=June 24, 2015  |author=The Editorial Board |accessdate= July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a conference call vote, the new board unanimously installed Phillip Stone as the new president. The new board also formally rescinded the previous board's announcement that the school was closing.&lt;ref name= "transfer of power"/&gt;

Stone announced in newspaper interviews that he did not regard this as an interim or one-year appointment, and that in years to come he intended to increase enrollment beyond Sweet Briar's highest past student count.&lt;ref name= "transfer of power"/&gt; Stone invited most current faculty and staff members to remain in their positions; the settlement includes paying six months' severance to any who depart.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Wset.com_June_24_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wset.com/story/29388963/incoming-sweet-briar-president-expects-to-invite-all-faculty-to-remain |title=Incoming Sweet Briar President Expects to Invite All Faculty to Remain |newspaper=Wset.com |date=  June 23, 2015|author= |accessdate= June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MyUser_Richmond.com_June_22_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richmond.com/news/local/education/article_1e591c1e-1a96-5c73-aac2-06fd69e2e18d.html |title=Judge OKs deal to save Sweet Briar College - Richmond Times-Dispatch: Education |newspaper=Richmond.com |date=June 22, 2015  |author=Karin Kapsidelis |accessdate= June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement required Saving Sweet Briar to deliver $12 million by September 2015 to help cover 2015–16 operating costs.

Semesters will change from a 15-week system to "3-12-12-3"-week semesters, with the three-week terms allowing for focus on opportunities such as intensive classes, study abroad, and research opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sweet Briar resets core curriculum and tuition for excellence, relevance and affordability|url=http://sbc.edu/news/sweet-briar-resets-core-curriculum-and-tuition-for-excellence-relevance-and-affordability/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After All but Closing, Sweet Briar Will Shift Curriculum and Pricing|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/After-All-but-Closing-Sweet/241100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Financial status and enrollment====
In January 2016, the college announced that it had received more than 1000 applications for the 2016–2017 academic year and that it did not plan to touch the $16 million of restricted funds initially planned to be released from the endowment by the attorney general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sweet Briar College sees highest number of new applicants in 50 years|url=http://m.wdbj7.com/news/local/sweet-briar-college-sees-highest-number-of-new-applicants-in-50-years/37535980|website=WDBJ7|publisher=WDBJ7|accessdate=20 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123003053/http://m.wdbj7.com/news/local/sweet-briar-college-sees-highest-number-of-new-applicants-in-50-years/37535980|archivedate=23 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the college's [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges|regional accreditor]] placed the Sweet Briar on "warning" status based on a review of its fiscal-year 2017 finances. Within the next 12 months, the college must demonstrate to the accreditor that its finances are sound and soundly managed or further action, including revocation of accreditation and loss of federal financial aid, could follow.&lt;ref name=Chronicle_2018_SACS_warning /&gt;

==Academics==
The college operates 50 undergraduate courses of study, three preprofessional programs (pre-law, pre-medicine and pre-veterinary), and two [[Graduate school|graduate]] [[academic degree|degree]]s.

The college's architecture is dominated by the work of [[Ralph Adams Cram]], who also lent his architectural expertise to the campuses of [[Princeton University]] and [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], among others. Although Cram's forte was [[Gothic Revival]], he designed Sweet Briar in the [[Colonial Revival]] style, using red brick buildings with white balustrades and arcades.&lt;ref&gt;archive.org, "[https://archive.org/details/ralphadamscramar00cham The Ralph Adams Cram Architecture of Sweet Briar College]," Chambers, S. Allen Jr., 1995 (Retrieved 3-17-15)&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-one of the thirty campus buildings were designated as the "Sweet Briar College Historic District" by the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

'''Tamara Eugenia Awerbuch-Friedlander''' is a [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|biomathematician]] and [[public health]] scientist who worked at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] (HSPH) in [[Boston]], Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/45989|title=Tamara Awerbuch-Friedlander {{!}} Harvard Catalyst Profiles {{!}} Harvard Catalyst|last=|first=|date=2014-04-07|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407073457/http://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/45989|archive-date=7 April 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her primary research and publications focus on [[Biosocial theory|biosocial interactions]] that cause or contribute to disease. She also is believed to be the first female Harvard faculty member to have had a [[jury trial]] for a lawsuit filed against [[Harvard University]] for [[sex discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaup.org/issues/women-academic-profession AAUP 'Issues' page on Women in the Academic Profession], accessed 05/02/2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="discrimination2004"&gt;The American Association of University Women, Tenure Denied: Cases of Sex Discrimination in Academia. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Tamara Awerbuch was born in [[Uruguay]], lived until the age of 12 in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], then moved to [[Israel]] with her parents, where her grandparents and parents had lived after they had escaped Nazi Germany just before the Holocaust began. She studied and completed two degrees at [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]]. She studied chemistry and minored in biochemistry and completed the BSc degree in 1965. In 1967, she completed both the Master of Science (MSc) in [[Physiology]] and the Master of Education (MEd) degree from Hebrew University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atiner.gr/bio/Awerbuch-Friedlander.pdf|title=CURRICULUM VITAE - TAMARA EUGENIA AWERBUCH FRIEDLANDER|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was certified to teach grades K–12 in [[Israel]], where she lectures and appears on panels and in workshops, as she does also in the United States and elsewhere. She also served for two years in the [[Israeli army]].

In October 1973, while visiting friends in America, she was offered employment at MIT in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to study chemical [[carcinogens]] in [[tissue culture]]s, then a recently developed technique. During this period, she worked in the lab studying carcinogenicity in tissue cultures, studied one course each semester, and lived frugally, sharing a house with MIT junior Faculty and graduate students. As one of her allotted courses per semester, in spring of 1974 she first started to study mathematics, taking mathematics and statistics. In summer 1975, she matriculated as a full-time student at MIT, where in 1979 she completed her doctorate in Nutrition and Food Science. She became a US citizen{{when|date=July 2018}} and has resided in the United States since that time. She was recruited in 1983 to the Biostatistics Department of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health by Department Chair [[Marvin Zelen]]. In 1993, she began a long career in the Department of Global Health and Population at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Her two sons, Danny and Ari, were born in the 1980s and reared in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. She speaks English, Hebrew, and Spanish fluently and understands and reads German.

==Education==
* Undergraduate study at Hebrew University in Israel.
**BSc in Chemistry (minor in [[biochemistry]]) – 1965
**MSc in Physiology – 1967
**MEd – Education (certified to teach K–12) – 1967
* PhD, MIT, Department of Nutrition and Food Science, Major in Metabolism, 1979
**Thesis: "A [[diffusion]] [[bioassay]] for the quantitative determination of [[mutagenicity]] of chemical carcinogens" (a theoretical study for determining safe threshold concentrations of [[food additives]] re: [[carcinogenesis]])
*Postdoc, MIT, in Somatic Cell Genetics 1979-1981

==Career==
Since the beginning of this century, she has organized and carried out research on conditions that lead to the emergence, maintenance, and spread of [[epidemics]]. Her research encompasses [[sexually-transmitted diseases]] (STDs) such as [[HIV/AIDS]], as well as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector-borne diseases]], such as [[Lyme disease]], [[dengue]], and [[Zika virus]] and [[Zika fever]]. Awerbuch-Friedlander recently researched the spread and control of [[rabies]] based on an eco-historical analysis. Her work is interdisciplinary, and some of her publications are co-authored with international scientists and members of different departments of the HSPH and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

Some of her analytical mathematical models led to fundamental epidemiological discoveries, for example, that oscillations are an intrinsic property of [[Tick-borne disease|tick dynamics]]. She presented her work in many international conferences and at the [[Isaac Newton Institute]] of Mathematical Sciences in [[Cambridge|Cambridge, England]], where she was invited to participate in the Program on Models of Epidemics.&lt;ref name="hsph.harvard.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tamara-awerbuchfriedlander/|title=Home {{!}} Tamara Awerbuch {{!}} Harvard T.H.

In addition, she established international collaborations, such as with Israeli scientists on emerging infectious diseases in the Middle East, with Cuban scientists on infectious diseases of plants and the development of general methodologies, and with Brazilian scientists on the development of concepts to guide effective surveillance.  In the late 1990s, Awerbuch-Friedlander was co-investigator in a project, "Why New and Resurgent Diseases Caught Public Health by Surprise and a Strategy to Prevent This" (supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation). At Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Awerbuch-Friedlander co-chaired the committee on Bio- and Public Health Mathematics. Some of her research papers were the result of collaboration with students through the course Mathematical Models in Biology, which had large portions dedicated to infectious diseases. She is indeed interested in public health education and has developed for high school adolescents educational software based on models for determining the risk that an individual with certain risky sexual behaviors actually would become infected with HIV. These models helped risk-prone youth, parents, educators, community health leaders, and public health researchers explore how changes in sexual behavior impact their probability of contracting HIV.&lt;ref name="hsph.harvard.edu"/&gt;

'''''The Analysis of Beauty''''' is a book written by the 18th-century artist and writer [[William Hogarth]], published in 1753, which describes Hogarth's theories of visual beauty and grace in a manner accessible to the common man of his day.

==The "Line of Beauty"==

Prominent among Hogarth's ideas of beauty was the theory of the [[Line of Beauty]]; an S-shaped (serpentine) curved line  that excited the attention of the viewer and evoked liveliness and movement. ''The Analysis of Beauty'' formed the intellectual centrepiece of what the historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] described as Hogarth's "grim campaign against fashionable taste",{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} which Hogarth himself described as his "War with the Connoisseurs".{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Six principles==

In ''The Analysis of Beauty'' Hogarth implements six principles that independently affect beauty. Although he concurs that those principles have an effect, he is not determinate on their specific influence. The first principle of beauty Hogarth describes is '''fitness''', which is not in itself a source of beauty, but can be described as a material cause of it. Though the account of fitness on the total beauty of an object is only moderate, it is a necessary cause. Fitness does not necessarily imply purpose. However, improperly implied forms cannot be the source of beauty. It is in this that the necessity of fitness must be seen: if not accounted for, a form cannot readily be assumed beautiful.

The second major principle of beauty is '''variety'''. It is the source of beauty, which Hogarth shows us by the contrary notion of "sameness": "sameness", a lack of variety, offends the senses. "The ear is as much offended with one even continued note, as the eye is with being fix'd to a point, or to the view of a dead wall."&lt;ref&gt;Hogarth, William, ''The Analysis of Beauty'', Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, our senses find relief in discovering a certain amount of "sameness" within a varietal experience.

The third notion of '''regularity''' is understood as a form of "composed variety": it only pleases us when it is suggestive to fitness. Similar to this notion in effect is '''simplicity''', which enhances the pleasure of variety in that it pleases the eye. The variety which causes a beautiful experience should, so to speak, be tempered by simplicity. On the other hand: simplicity without variety at best does only not displease.

'''Intricacy''' is a strange principle in that it does not directly follow from the formal behaviour of a beautiful object. Hogarth means by this the habit which causes us to end up in the whirling game of pursuit, when bit by bit discovering the beauty of an object. Intricacy arises from the love of this pursuit. Every difficulty in understanding or grasping the object enhances the pleasure of overcoming it, to continue the pursuit. There is a direct connection here to the [[Line of Beauty]] Hogarth dictates, along which every image is built up. Though the movement of our eye is discrete in itself, the movement of our "Mind's eye" follows a duplicate course of the line, a principal ray of light moving along with the line of sight. The continuous movement of our "Mind's eye" triggers the notion of intricacy.

'''Quantity''', finally, is associated with the notion of the [[sublime (literary)|sublime]], which, when Hogarth's book appeared, was not yet entirely distinguished from the apprehension of beauty. Hogarth thus does not speak of sublimity, but of '''greatness'''. He recognises a great quantity to have an aesthetic effect on the beholder without the necessity of a varietal or fitting form. This should not be exaggerated, as that might lead to absurdities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2375">'''The Lovers' Guide''' is a sex and relationships advice brand, produced by Lifetime Productions International Ltd, which launched with the release of the first ''Lovers' Guide'' video in 1991. Presented by the sexologist Dr Andrew Stanway, and produced by [[Robert Page (Lifetime Group)|Robert Page]] and William Campbell, this became the only non-fiction film to top the UK video charts; it sold 1.3 million copies in the UK and went into 13 languages and 22 countries around the world. The release caused controversy. While the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] (British Board of Film Classification) granted the title an [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18 certificate]], which would normally be a license for general UK distribution, this was technically merely advisory and the producer, Robert Page, faced charges of obscenity, which were subsequently dropped.

''The Lovers' Guide'' is distinct for using explicit video material to illustrate the instructional points being made. While the explicit nature of the visual content would usually warrant an [[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18 certificate]] in the UK, restricting sales to licensed sex shops, all ''Lovers' Guide'' videos and DVDs have been granted 18 certificates.

''Lovers' Guide'' products has expanded to ten further DVDs, a book, an encyclopaedia, two CD-ROMs and cassettes and CDs of the soundtracks. It has also been shown on encrypted television. These have been produced, distributed and retailed with partners such as W.H. Smith, Woolworths, Carlton, Bloomsbury, Warners, Sony and Universal. The brand website is [http://www.loversguide.com/].

{{See also|Transparency of media ownership in Europe}}

[[Transparency of media ownership in Europe|Transparency of media ownership]] refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures to make possible for media authorities and the wider public to ascertain who effectively owns and controls the media. In [[Romania]] transparency of media ownership is addressed directly in the Constitution and is regulated by a media-specific law, namely the Audiovisual Law no. 504, and by national company law. As for constitutional provisions, even if [[Romania]] is among the few European countries that addresses the issue of media transparency directly in the Constitution, it should be said that the focus is on transparency of financial sources and not on ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/18780552/Craufurd_Smith_Stolte_Transparency_of_Media_Ownership_in_the_EU_24sep2014.pdf Rachel Craufurd and Yolande Stolte, The transparency of media ownership in the European Union and Neighbouring States, Access-Info, Open Society Program on Independent Journalism, September 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, despite the constitutional provisions on the right to impose an obligation on the media to make public their sources of finance, the Parliament has never enacted the applicable legislation which is indeed absent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/18780552/Craufurd_Smith_Stolte_Transparency_of_Media_Ownership_in_the_EU_24sep2014.pdf Rachel Craufurd and Yolande Stolte, The transparency of media ownership in the European Union and Neighbouring States, Access-Info, Open Society Program on Independent Journalism, September 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian media-specific law requiring the disclosure of media ownership information applies only to the broadcast sector and provides the disclosure to both a public authority, namely the [[National Audiovisual Council]] (CNA) and directly to the public. Finally, also the national company law contains provisions regulating transparency of media ownership. It applies to all media which are registered companies and foresees the obligation to publish all the most relevant information on companies' ownership in the [[Trade Register Company]]. Overall, even though the Romanian legislation in the field of media ownership transparency is fully aligned with the European standards, in practice sufficient information to assess who effectively owns and ultimately controls the media is not always available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==

===Media-specific law: disclosure to a public authority===

Romanian law on media ownership transparency only covers the broadcast sector and has no similar provision for print media, but, in practice, many Romanian newspapers make public their publishers and owners. The situation is more complicated for online media and blogs where anonymity is very common.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irex.org/sites/default/files/pdf/media-sustainability-index-europe-eurasia-2016-romania.pdf.pdf IREX 2016, Europe &amp; Eurasia Media Sustainability Index 2016: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant law, named [[Audiovisual Law no. 504]], requires the disclosure of all the information necessary to identify the owners of media companies, e.g. name and contact details of the media organisation; name and contact detail of owners; country of domicile of company with an interest; citizenship / residence status of individual with an interest beyond a given threshold. However, the disclosure requirement does not apply to [[beneficial ownership]], which refers to shares of a media company hold on behalf of another person. According to the law, the information must be reported to the [[National Audiovisual Council]], a public regulatory authority under the control of the Parliament. The CNA is the guarantor of the public interest in the audiovisual field.

One of the main problem of the law concerns indirect interest: threshold for disclosing indirect interest, which is 20%, looks too high to provide proper information for assessing media ownership and guaranteeing transparency. Furthermore, getting information on individuals or companies with indirect control or significant interests in a given media company is quite time-consuming and complex as it requires in practice a step-by-step process of checking and cross-referencing of a large number of different records.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to constraints or costs for public access to the information held by the [[National Audiovisual Council]] there are not particularly high costs or time-consuming procedures, even if, in general terms, accessing information held by public institutions often entails several barriers, such as the reluctance of public officials to reveal sensitive information and their resort to broad interpretations of the exceptions to public disclosure of information.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the legal framework provides the disclosure of nearly all the information needed to identify ownership of the broadcast media in Romania. However, the threshold for reporting indirect interest (20%), the difficulties in obtaining information on entities or persons with indirect control and significant interest, abuses and poor implementation, the lack of co-operation between the CNA and other authorities leave room to abuses and insufficient disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media-specific law: disclosure directly to the public===

According to Article. 48 of Law 504 of 2002, media companies from the audiovisual field must also disclose the information on media ownership directly to the public through their websites. The requirement applies to all kind of information to be disclosed in accordance with the law. In particular, financial information must be updated and disclosed on an annual basis, while the other information must be always available to the public (requirement of the “permanent access” by the public, according to Article 48).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-media specific transparency requirements: company law ===

In addition to the Audiovisual Law, another source of regulation for transparency of media ownership in Romania is [[Corporate law|company law]] which contains non-media specific transparency requirements. The relevant law, which is the Law 31 / 1990 on Trading Companies is applicable to all registered media company owing a licence and forbids owners' anonymity: companies are therefore obliged to publish all the main information on ownership in the [[Trade Register Office]] (TRO) and to communicate changes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; All the constitutive deeds and the modifications are registered in the Trade Registry and published in the Official Journal. The specific information to be disclosed depends on the legal type of the company and might be different for each type of business organisations. However, the mandatory information for all companies are: names, the date and the place of birth, the address and the citizenship of the partners / shareholders (in case of natural persons); the name, the headquarter address and the nationality of the associates (in case of legal persons); the type, name, headquarters address and the company logo; the company’s field of activity; the registered capital, including the contribution of each partner in cash or in kind; the number and the face value of the shares and the number of shares given to each partners; the managers of the company and their rights; the share given to each associate in case of profit and loss; secondary headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania.

The public can directly access this data by requesting information from the Trade Registry. Also, since the constitutive documents are also published in the Official Journal, the public can consult this information through the institutional website of the Journal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania.

Even if the law requires the disclosure of all necessary information on ownership, in fact this data have to be reported to various agencies. This might imply, for instance, a complicated step-by-step check process involving request for information from different agencies for each company in the cases of chains of ownership, such as companies owning other companies and the like.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania.

According to some critics, the Trade Register Office only shows the tip of the iceberg since the real owner of the media and who effectively controls them remain hidden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.mirovni-institut.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/media-ownership-and-its-impact-on-media-independence-and-pluralism.pdf Manuela Proteasa, 2004, "Romania" in Media ownership and its impact on media independence and pluralism / &amp;#91;editor Brankica Petković&amp;#93;.

==Transparency of media ownership in practice==

Despite the fact that Romanian legislation in the field of media ownership transparency is formally aligned with the European standards (both the [[European Commission]] and the [[Council of Europe]] standards are incorporated in the national legal framework), in practice, there are some major problems. Among the main shortcomings there is the absence of the requirement to disclose all the necessary data to establish which are the owners in case of indirect control or having significant interests in the media company. Moreover, at the practical level, the implementation of the law leaves room for abuses and inadequate disclosure. In sum, a set of factors, including the difficulty in ascertain indirect control and significant interest, implementation problems as well as the challenges in accessing public information result in a significant difficulty for the general public in accessing all the key information to establish who effectively owns and ultimately controls a media outlet.

'''Washington College''' is a private, independent [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Chestertown, Maryland]]. Maryland granted Washington College its charter in 1782. [[George Washington]] supported the founding of the college by consenting to have the "College at Chester" named in his honor, through generous financial support, and through service on the college's Board of Visitors and Governors. Washington College is the [[Colonial Colleges|10th-oldest college]] in the [[United States]] and was the first college chartered after American independence. The school became [[coeducational]] in 1891.

==History==
[[File:Bronze GW Statue.jpg|thumb|left|A bronze George Washington statue overlooks the campus green.]]
Washington College evolved from the Kent County Free School, an institution of more than 60 years' standing in "Chester Town," which by the college's founding date of 1782 had reached considerable strength and importance as a port city. [[George Washington]] consented to the fledgling college's use of his name, pledged the sum of 50 guineas to its establishment, and extended his warm wishes for the "lasting and extensive usefulness" of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Washington]] to William Smith, August 18, 1782. George Washington Papers, Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt; He later served on Washington College's Board of Visitors and Governors — his only such involvement with an institution of higher learning.

The college's first president, the Reverend [[William Smith (Episcopalian priest)|William Smith]], was a prominent figure in colonial affairs of letters and church, and he had a wide acquaintance among the great men of colonial days, including [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Joining General Washington on the Board of Visitors and Governors of the new college were such distinguished figures as U.S. Senator [[John Henry (Maryland)|John Henry]], Congressman [[Joshua Seney]] and his Excellency [[William Paca]], Governor of Maryland. The Maryland legislature granted its first college charter upon Washington College in May 1782.&lt;ref&gt;[http://revcollege.washcoll.edu/firstcollege/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519054204/http://revcollege.washcoll.edu/firstcollege/index.html |date=May 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following spring, on May 14, 1783, the college held its first commencement.

President Smith had envisaged Washington College as the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] Campus of a public University of Maryland with [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] as its [[Western Shore]] counterpart, a proposal incorporated into the later institution's 1784 state charter, but the [[Maryland General Assembly|Maryland General Assembly's]] reluctance to provide funding meant this was never more than a paper institution and the relationship ended with Smith's return to Philadelphia in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tilghman|first1=Tench Francis|title=The Early History of St. John's College in Annapolis|date=1984|publisher=St. John's College Press|location=Annapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his election as first President of the United States, General Washington retired from the Board of Visitors and Governors and accepted the honorary degree of doctor of laws, which a delegation from Chestertown presented to him on June 24, 1789, in New York, then the seat of Congress. Since Washington's last visit to campus, Washington College has hosted five U.S. presidents: [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], [[Harry S Truman]], [[Dwight Eisenhower]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[George H. W. Bush]].

The original college building cornerstone was laid in May 1783, it opened in 1788 after selling off acreage and starting a lottery to fund the project. The hall was still incomplete by 1794 and was destroyed by a basement fire January 11, 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Maryland History in Prints 1743-1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest existing building, Middle Hall, was erected in 1844 on the site of the original college building. By 1860, Middle Hall was joined by East and West Halls. All three structures, known as the Hill Dorms, are on the Maryland Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register Listings in Maryland|url={{MHT url|id=557}}|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==

===Student body and admissions===
[[File:WC aerial.jpg|thumb|250px|Washington College campus]]

[[File:ChestertownMD Rivershot.jpg|thumb|250px|Chestertown's historic waterfront]]
For the 2011-2012 academic year, 56.6% of applicants were accepted to the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington College, Applying|url=https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-university-search/washington-college|publisher=The College Board|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 1,400 [[undergraduate]]s and 100 [[graduate student]]s attend Washington College, 47 percent from Maryland and the balance from 35 [[U.S. state|other states]] and forty foreign nations. Approximately 8 percent of the American undergraduates are [[minority group|minority]] students and approximately 8 percent are international citizens. Approximately 5 percent of the college's student body is "non-traditional" (25 years old or older).  Approximately 80 percent of all students live in college residence halls; the rest commute either from off-campus housing or from home.

[[Tuition]] for the 2012-2013 year is $39,208 and total expenses per annum (including room, board, and fees) are $48,768.  Approximately 85 percent of the student body receives some form of need-based financial aid or merit-based [[scholarship]] award. The cost of attendance has been rising in recent years, with the overall costs (including room and board) increasing by roughly $2,000 per year.

===Rankings===
In 2015, Washington College was ranked by ''The Princeton Review'' as 16th in the United States among "Colleges With The Happiest Students In 2015-16".&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colleges-with-the-happiest-students_55bfe207e4b06f8bedb5b584 |title=Colleges With The Happiest Students In 2015-16, According To Princeton Review |publisher=Huffington Post |date= |accessdate=2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 edition of ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' Best Colleges, Washington College rose 19 positions to 93rd in the nation in the National Liberal Arts Colleges category.&lt;ref name="colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/chestertown-md/washington-college-maryland-2108 |title=colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |publisher=colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary prizes==
Each year, Washington College awards the nation's largest undergraduate literary prize. Since 1968, the Sophie Kerr Prize has been presented to one graduating senior who demonstrates the greatest literary promise. The endowment created by [[Sophie Kerr]], a writer who published 23 novels and dozens of short stories, has provided more than $1.4 million in prize money to young writers.  At a ceremony held at the [[Poets House]] in New York City on May 17, 2011, Lisa Jones was selected as the winner of the $61,000 Sophie Kerr Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Childs Walker|work= The Baltimore Sun |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-05-17/news/bs-md-sophie-kerr-prize-20110517_1_sophie-kerr-prize-literary-prize-volunteer-work |title=articles.baltimoresun.com |publisher=articles.baltimoresun.com |date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Washington College inaugurated another literary prize, the [[George Washington Book Prize]], administered by the college's [[C.V. Starr Center for the Study of the American Experience]] and awarded in partnership with the [[Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History]] and George Washington's Mount Vernon. The prize is awarded annually to the most significant new book about the founding era. At $50,000, the prize is one of the most generous book awards in the United States. [[Richard Beeman]] won the 2010 George Washington Book Prize for his work, ''Plain, Honest Men: The Making of the American Constitution.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/penn-professor-richard-beeman-s-plain-honest-men-wins-2010-george-washington-book-prize |title=upenn.edu |publisher=upenn.edu |date=2010-05-24 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Rose O’Neill Literary House, Washington College's center for literature and the literary arts, established the [[Douglass Wallop]] Fellowship as a nationwide competition, with the first fellowship going to playwright [[Sheri Wilner]].   The award will be granted biennially to a playwright.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washcoll.edu/live/news/5422-sheri-wilner-awarded-2015-douglass-wallop Sheri Wilner awarded 2015 Douglass Wallop Fellowship] Washington College, May 01, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
The school has over 90 student clubs.

Freshmen, unless local, are required to live on-campus.  On-campus housing is available for approximately 900 students. Most students (70-75 percent) stay on-campus over the weekend to participate in various social and recreational activities.

Approximately 30 percent of students attend graduate school in the first year following graduation and approximately 45 percent do so within five years.

The student to faculty ratio is 12:1. The average class size is 17.

The school confers the degrees of [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Science]], and [[Master of Arts]] (in English, psychology and history).

Washington College has joined American College &amp; University Presidents Climate Commitment with a [[Campus carbon neutrality]] goal. The Center for Environment and Society oversees the Chesapeake Semester program, four interdisciplinary courses that use the College's location in the Chesapeake Bay watershed to explore environmental issues and advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chesapeake-semester.washcoll.edu |title=Washington College &amp;#124; Chesapeake Semester |publisher=Chesapeake-semester.washcoll.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington College is host to the Harwood Series, which includes speeches by national politicians and media pundits. Because of its reputation as a liberal arts school with creative writing being a strength, writers such as [[John Barth]], [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Bobbie Ann Mason]], [[Colum McCann]], [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Tim O'Brien (author)|Tim O'Brien]], [[Junot Diaz]], and [[Robert Pinsky]] have given readings at the campus.

===Greek life===

===Traditions===

'''George Washington Birthday Ball''': A college-wide dance where students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends of the college come together to celebrate George Washington's birthday. The event usually takes place on, or around, the actual date of George Washington's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://birthdayball.washcoll.edu/ |title=Washington College &amp;#124; News and Events |publisher=Birthdayball.washcoll.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''War on the Shore''': The annual men's lacrosse game, held in late spring between Washington College and [[Salisbury University]], two of Maryland's Eastern Shore's undergraduate schools.

Clark Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtoncollegesports.com/mlacrosse/releases/04cup.html |title=Washington College Men's Lacrosse |publisher=washingtoncollegesports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[May Day (Washington College)|May Day]]''': Started in 1968 by Professor Bennett Lamond of the English Department, who retired in 2004. He brought a class out onto the green, where they read poetry and drank wine. Later that night some of the students returned, and Washington College's May Day celebration was born. Since then, May Day has become a two-day festival on April 30 and May 1, often involving public nudity by some of the student body. The event draws many students as spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjjBgtvrQNY |title=Video Interview with Bennett Lamond |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==

===Varsity sports===
[[File:WashingtonCollegeWar.On.The.Shore.jpg|thumb|The annual lacrosse rivalry between Washington College and [[Salisbury University]] is known as '''The War on the Shore'''.]]

Washington College has competed in intercollegiate athletics since the 19th century.  Its oldest current varsity sports are the baseball team, which dates back to at least the early 1870s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtoncollegesports.com/sports/bsb/history/alltime_records |title=washingtoncollegesports.com |publisher=washingtoncollegesports.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the men's basketball team, which plays its 100th season in 2011-12.&lt;ref name="washingtoncollegesports.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtoncollegesports.com/sports/mbkb/history/alltime_records |title=washingtoncollegesports.com |publisher=washingtoncollegesports.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men's teams are known as the Shoremen; women's teams are known as the Shorewomen.

While men have been playing varsity sports at Washington College for well over a century, varsity opportunities for women have been a more recent development. The first varsity sports for women&amp;nbsp;– rowing, tennis, and volleyball&amp;nbsp;– were added in the mid-1970s and were followed by the additions of softball, lacrosse, field hockey, and swimming by the mid-1980s. Varsity women's basketball began play during the 1993-94 season, while co-ed sailing was elevated to varsity status four years later. The women's soccer team is the college's newest varsity sport; it began play during the fall of 1998.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Washington College fielded a varsity football team through 1950, a men's track and field team through 1982, and a men's cross country team through 1989. The college previously sponsored varsity men's golf and varsity wrestling.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

14 of Washington College's 17 varsity teams compete in the [[Centennial Conference]]. The men's and women's rowing teams compete in the [[College rowing (United States)#Mid-Atlantic Rowing Conference|Mid-Atlantic Rowing Conference]] (MARC), while the sailing team competes in the [[Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association]] (MAISA), a part of the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The rowing and sailing teams host regattas on the Chester River and call the college's Truslow Boat House and Lelia Hynson Boating Park home.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The college's 17 varsity teams are:{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

'''Middle, East and West Halls''' stand on the crest of a low hill (the terrace) at the center of campus. Middle Hall (built 1844) and East and West Halls (built 1854) hold a special place in the history of Washington College, as they are the oldest surviving campus buildings.  They serve as monuments to the original Common Building (completed in 1789), whose site they occupy.  They are all three-story buildings constructed of brick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{MHT url|id=557}}|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=2008-10-05|work= National Register of Historic Places: Middle, East and West Halls|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="nris" /&gt;

They now function as follows:
*East Hall&amp;nbsp;– The International House is a three-floor coed building that serves as a home for students interested in international relation and foreign language study. This theme house has a faculty advisor.
*Middle Hall&amp;nbsp;– The Creative Arts House is a coed building for students interested in drama, music, visual art, literature, and the creative arts in general.
*West Hall&amp;nbsp;– The Science House is a three-floor coed building that serves as a home for students interested in the natural sciences. This theme house has a faculty advisor.

'''World College West''' was an undergraduate [[liberal arts college]] in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], [[California]]. Founded by Dr. [[Richard M. Gray]], it offered a program that integrated a grounding in the [[liberal arts]] with work-study and a required two-quarter "World Study" in a developing country. It opened with its first seven students on September 17, 1973.

Fully accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]], World College West had programs in International Service and Development (ISD), International Environmental Studies (IES), Art and Society (AS), and Meaning, Culture, and Change (MCC). In later years, Business and International Business was added to the program line-up. ISD focused on the economic, political, and social development of "Third World" nations; IES concentrated on the wise use and global conservation of natural resources; AS examined the relationship between culture and the performing and visual arts; and MCC focused on the variety of ways in which the world's diverse cultures, through their systems of religion, philosophy, and tradition, give meaning and purpose to human life, and to the world around us. 

The college's World Study Programs were established in [[China]], [[Mexico]], [[Nepal]], [[India]], [[Ghana]], and [[Russia]]. Students could spend two quarters (six months) studying in both an urban and rural setting in one of these countries. During the urban stay, students lived with a host family and attended regularly scheduled language, culture, and history classes. During the rural stay, students again lived with host families and conducted independent research studies while continuing to learn the country's language.

The college placed a special emphasis on work-study and internships, because the founders of the college believed that learning occurred best through "disciplined reflection on experience". Once an area of study was selected, students were required to complete 480 internship hours in their field of study as part of their graduation requirement.

During its first few years, the College leased space on the campus of the [[San Francisco Theological Seminary]] in [[San Anselmo, California|San Anselmo]], followed by several years in surplus army [[barracks]] at [[Fort Cronkhite]] on the Pacific Ocean. In the early 1980s the college built and moved to a permanent campus off [[U.S. Highway 101]] in the rolling hills of northern Marin County, between [[Novato, California|Novato]] and [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]] (now the home of the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]]).

World College West closed due to inadequate funding in Fall of 1992, the result of difficulties in succession after its founding president retired. The spirit of WCW lives on in Dick Gray's successor institution [[Presidio Graduate School]][http://www.presidiomba.org/]. The hundreds of WCW alumni call themselves "Westies".

In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], '''Zeno machines''' (abbreviated '''ZM''', and also called '''accelerated Turing machine''', '''ATM''') are a hypothetical computational model related to [[Turing machines]] that allows a [[countably infinite]] number of algorithmic steps to be performed in finite time.  These machines are ruled out in most models of computation.

More formally, a Zeno machine is a Turing machine that takes 2&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt; units of time to perform its ''n''-th step; thus, the first step takes 0.5 units of time, the second takes 0.25, the third 0.125 and so on, so that after one unit of time, a [[countably infinite]] (i.e. [[aleph_0#Aleph-null|&amp;alefsym;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]&lt;!-- &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; --&gt;) number of steps will have been performed.

The idea of Zeno machines was first discussed by [[Hermann Weyl]] in 1927; the name refers to [[Zeno's paradoxes]], attributed to the ancient Greek philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]]. Zeno machines play a crucial role in some theories. The theory of the [[Omega Point]] devised by physicist [[Frank J. Tipler]], for instance, can only be valid if Zeno machines are possible.

== Zeno machines and computability ==

Zeno machines would allow some functions to be computed that are not Turing-computable. For example, the [[halting problem]] for Turing machines can be solved by a Zeno machine (using the following [[pseudocode]] algorithm):

 begin program
   write 0 on the first position of the output tape;
   begin loop
     simulate 1 successive step of the given Turing machine on the given input;
     if the Turing machine has halted, then write 1 on the first position of the output tape and break out of loop;
   end loop
 end program

Computing of this kind that goes beyond the Turing Limit is called [[hypercomputation]], in this case hypercomputation through a [[supertask]] - see there for further discussion and literature.
