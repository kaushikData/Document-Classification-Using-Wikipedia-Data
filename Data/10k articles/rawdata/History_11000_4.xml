[[File:A New Chart of History color.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Joseph Priestley's ''A New Chart of History'' (1769)]]
In 1769, 18th-century British [[polymath]] [[Joseph Priestley]] published '''''A New Chart of History''''' and its prose explanation as a supplement to his ''[[Lectures on History and General Policy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A New Chart of History''. London: Engraved and published for J. Johnson, 1769; ''A Description of a New Chart of History''. London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1770.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his ''[[A Chart of Biography|Chart of Biography]]'' (1765), which he dedicated to his friend [[Benjamin Franklin]]), Priestley believed these charts would allow students to "trace out distinctly the dependence of events to distribute them into such periods and divisions as shall lay the whole claim of past transactions in a just and orderly manner."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 141-2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Chart of History'' lists events in 106 separate locations; it illustrates Priestley's belief that the entire world's history was significant, a relatively new development in the 18th century, which had begun with [[Voltaire]] and [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]. The world's history is divided up into the following geographical categories: Scandinavia, Poland, Russia, Great Britain, Spain, France, Italy, Turkey in Europe, Turkey in Asia, Germany, Persia, India, China, Africa and America. Priestley aimed to show the history of empires and the passing of power; the subtitle of the ''Description'' that accompanied the chart was "A View of the Principal Revolutions of Empire that have taken place in the World" and he wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The capital use [of the ''Charts'' was as] a most excellent mechanical help to the knowledge of history, impressing the imagination indelibly with a just image of the rise, progress, extent, duration, and contemporary state of all the considerable empires that have ever existed in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As Arthur Sheps in his article about the ''Charts'' explains, "the horizontal line conveys an idea of the duration of fame, influence, power and domination. A vertical reading conveys an impression of the contemporaneity of ideas, events and people. The number or density of entries . . . tells us about the vitality of any age."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Voids in the chart indicated intellectual Dark Ages, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 148.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both ''Charts'' were popular for decades—the ''A New Chart of History'' went through fifteen editions by 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the [[University of Edinburgh]] to grant him a [[Doctor of Laws|Doctor of Law degree]] in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 118-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2210">'''Aboiteau''' farming on reclaimed [[marshland]] is a [[labor-intensive]] method in which earthen [[Levee|dyke]]s are constructed to stop high tides from inundating marshland.  A wooden [[sluice]] or aboiteau (plural aboiteaux) is then built into the dyke, with a hinged door (clapper valve) that swings open at [[low tide]] to allow fresh water to drain from the farmland but swings shut at [[high tide]] to prevent [[Seawater|salt water]] from inundating the fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metronews.ca/halifax/local/article/90160 "More funding for shifting aboiteau" - Metro News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605062437/http://www.metronews.ca/halifax/local/article/90160 |date=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amherstdaily.com/Construction-real-estate/2007-08-14/article-384737/Excavation-uncovers-Acadian-aboiteau/1 "Excavation uncovers Acadian aboiteau" - Amherst Daily News]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboiteau farming is intimately linked with the story of [[Acadians|French Acadian]] colonization of the shores of Canada's [[Bay of Fundy]] in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Hatvany, MG "The Origins of the Acadian Aboiteau: An Environmental Historical Geography," Historical Geography, 30 (2002): 121-137.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Kamouraska, Quebec|Kamouraska region]] of the [[St. Lawrence Valley]] of Quebec, aboiteau diking of salt marshes was closely tied to the modernization of agriculture in the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Hatvany, MG Marshlands: Four Centuries of Environmental Change on the Shores of the St. Lawrence (Québec: Les Presses de l'Université Laval, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The Acadians constructed earthen dykes to isolate areas of salt marsh from repeated inundation by the tides.

A rare original "aboiteau" is the jewel of the West Pubnico Acadian Museums' artifacts.   In 1990, local residents found a couple of boards sticking out of an eroding beach on Double Island, West Pubnico.  They returned to the site in 1996 to remove the aboiteau, to preserve and display it at the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Musée des Acadiens des Pubnicos et Centre de recherche&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ebana3.png|thumb|300px|5th-century gold coin of King [[Ebana]].]]
'''Aksumite currency''' was [[coin]]age produced and used within the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] (or Axum) centered in  present-day [[Eritrea]] and the [[Tigray Region]] of [[Ethiopia]]. Its mints were issued and circulated from the reign of [[Kings of Axum|King]] [[Endubis]] around AD 270 until it began its decline in the first half of the 7th century. During the succeeding medieval period, [[Mogadishu currency]], minted by the [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]], was the most widely circulated currency in the [[Horn of Africa]].&lt;ref name="Ncaaroth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chittick|first=Neville|title=An Archaeological Reconnaissance of the Horn: The British-Somali Expedition|year=1975|pages=117–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aksum's currency served as a vessel of propaganda demonstrating the kingdom's wealth and promoting the national religion (first [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] and later [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Christianity]]). It also facilitated the [[Red Sea]] trade on which it thrived.&lt;ref name="Munro155"&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', pp. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The coinage has also proved invaluable in providing a reliable chronology of Aksumite kings due to the lack of extensive archaeological work in the area.&lt;ref name="Encyc767"&gt;Wolfgang, "Coinage" in Siegbert, ed. ''Encyclopaedia'', p. 767.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{History of Ethiopia}}

===Pre-coinage period===
Though the issuing of minted coins didn't begin until around 270, metal coins may have been used in Aksum centuries prior to centralized minting. The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' mentions that the Aksumite state imported brass ({{lang-gr|ορείχαλκος|orikhalkos}}), "which they use[d] for ornaments and for cutting as money", and they imported "a little money (''denarion'') for [use by] foreigners who live there." It can be inferred, therefore, that early Aksumite kings, located on the international trading waters of the [[Red Sea]], recognized the utility of a standardized currency for facilitating both domestic and international trade.&lt;ref name="Munro151"&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', pp. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
Though Aksumite coins are indigenous in design and creation, some outside influences encouraging the use of coins is undeniable. By the time coins were first minted in Aksum, there was widespread trade with [[Roman Empire|Romans]] on the [[Red Sea]]; [[Kushana]] or [[Persia]]n influence also cannot be ruled out. Roman, [[Himyar]]ite, and Kushana coins have all been found in major Aksumite cities, however, only very small quantities have been attested and the circulation of foreign currency seems to have been limited.&lt;ref name="Munro152"&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[South Arabia]]n kingdoms had also minted coins, they had already gone out of use by the time of certain Aksumite involvement in South Arabia under [[GDRT]], and only very rarely produced [[electrum]] or [[gold coin|gold]] denominations ([[silver coin|silver]] mainly in [[Sabaeans|Saba']] and Himyar, while [[bronze]] in [[Hadhramaut]]), making influence unlikely. The major impetus, however, was not emulation but economical; the Red Sea and its coasts had always been an international trade area and coins would greatly facilitate trade and wealth in the now "world power."&lt;ref name="Munro150"&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum: An African Civilization of Late Antiquity''. Edinburgh: University Press, 1991, pp. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these influences, the coins were of genuinely indigenous design, and foreign influences were relatively weak and few in number.&lt;ref name="Encyc768"&gt;Hahn, Wolfgang, "Coinage" in Uhlig, Siegbert, ed., ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A-C''. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2003. p. 768.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Christian period==
Aksumite currency were first minted in the later stages of the growth of the empire, when its [[Golden Age]] had already begun. The minting of coins began around 270, beginning with the reign of Endubis.

==Source of materials==

===Gold===
[[File:Endubis.jpg|300px|thumb|Gold coin of [[Endubis]].]]
Gold seems to have been acquired from a number of sources. Gold probably came from ''Sasu'' (southern [[Sudan]]), as well as more nearby [[Ethiopia]]n sources, though the latter isn't well documented for the north. A gold trade from the southern areas of Ethiopia such as the medieval province/kingdom of [[Innarya]] has been attested from the 6th century (i.e. from the writings of [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]]) and continued through [[James Bruce]]'s day (18th century). Gold also came from more northerly sources such as [[Gojjam]], [[Beja people|Beja]] lands, and what is now [[Eritrea]], though the latter two are less certain.&lt;ref name="Munro143"&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', pp.143&lt;/ref&gt; However, a recent gold exploration assay in Eritrea has found significant gold deposits at [[Emba Derho]], and deposits are also attested at Zara in central-western Eritrea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miningweekly.co.za/min/news/today/?show=87811 "Promising results from Eritrean gold campaign"], ''Mining Weekly Online''. June 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silver and others===
[[File:Gersem.jpg|300px|thumb|Base coinage with the rare front portrait.]]
While local sources of gold are attested during the Aksumite era, [[silver]] seems to have been rarer in Aksum. No mention of silver mines in the region exist until the 15th and 16th centuries. Though silver was imported as attested by the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'',&lt;ref&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', pp.145&lt;/ref&gt; given the preponderance of silver coins, it could not have been the only source of silver in Aksum. Furthermore, a significant number of the silver coins contain gold inlays (presumably to increase the value), which would have been unnecessary if silver were so rare that it had to be mainly imported.&lt;ref name="Munro143" /&gt; Silver may have been obtained from the refinement of gold, which sometimes occurs naturally with silver in an alloy called [[electrum]].&lt;ref name="Encyc767" /&gt; [[Copper]] and [[bronze]] do not seem to have existed locally in the Aksumite empire, though they were noted as imports in the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea''.&lt;ref name="Munro143" /&gt;

==Value==
Though the gold coins were certainly the most valuable issue, followed by the silver one, the exact relationship between the three issues (gold, silver, and bronze) is not known. The supply of gold was closely controlled by the Aksumite state, as noted by Cosmas Indicopleustes, and other precious metals were undoubtedly also closely controlled, allowing the Aksumite state to ensure the usage of its currency.&lt;ref name="Munro154"&gt;Munro-Hays, ''Aksum'', pp. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of the Aksumite coins were also closely controlled, usually of high purity. For example, the lowest purity of gold recorded thus far for Aphilas is 90 percent.&lt;ref name="Munro159"&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', pp.159.&lt;/ref&gt; Early issues were often very close to their theoretical weights, and some were even over.&lt;ref name="Munro158"&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', pp. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;) However, the weight of the coins tended to decrease over time (though not continuously or uniformly).&lt;ref name="Encyc767" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Munro159" /&gt; This may have reflected a desire to conform to the Diocletian monetary reform of 301, when the [[aureus]] was decreased from 1/60 of a pound to 1/72. Despite decreases in weight, the purity of the gold was largely maintained, even by later kings. The relative abundance of Aksumite coins as well as the many that have yet to be found&lt;ref name="Percent"&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002707622_obelisk28.html Obelisk, new finds unleash debate in Ethiopia.] [[The Seattle Times]] Online. 28 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that Aksum must have had access to large quantities of gold.&lt;ref name="Munro159" /&gt;

==Design==
[[File:WazebaGe'ezLegend.png|right|thumb|300px|Sketch of gold coin of [[Wazeba of Axum|Wazeba]] using the Ge'ez script and language.]]
The coins were often inscribed in [[Greek language|Greek]], as much of its trade was with the "Graecised Orient." Later inscriptions made more use of [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]], the language of the Aksumites, perhaps indicating a decline in its use for more international trade (i.e. with Rome and India). The obverse of the coins would always feature an image of the king (almost always in profile) wearing either a crown or helmet/regnal headcloth. The headcloth had some image perhaps representing pleats, rays, or sunburst in the front, as well as the tied end of a cloth or fillet to hold the helmet or headcloth in place. Most coins also included an inscription (usually in Greek) meaning "King of Aksum" or King of the Aksumites" (''Basileus AXWMITW'').&lt;ref name="Munro154" /&gt; However, many coins were also minted anonymously (or even posthumously), especially during the 5th century.&lt;ref name="Encyc767" /&gt; Inscriptions on the coins could include a ''bisi'' name ("man of," Ge'ez: bə'əsyä ብእስየ&lt;ref&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', pp. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', pp.75&lt;/ref&gt;) or an epithet (beginning with ''Əllä'', Ge'ez: እለ "he who") in addition to the king's personal name. ''Bisi'' names were used more often in conjuncture with personal names on earlier coins, while the epithets were more common in later years, being the only inscribed name in a few sources.&lt;ref name="Encyc767" /&gt; Greek text was used in conjunction with [[Ge'ez script]] inscriptions, but was the only language used on the gold coins, with the exception of the Ge'ez language coins of Wazeba and [[MHDYS]]. Over time, the Greek used on the coins (gold, silver and bronze) deteriorated, indicative of Aksum's decline. Moreover, beginning with MHDYS for bronze coins and Wazeba for silver coins, Ge'ez gradually replaced Greek on the legends.&lt;ref name="Munro159"/&gt;

===Mottoes===
Aksumite coins used a number of mottoes throughout the period in which they were minted, beginning in the early 4th century. Around this time, numerous anonymous bronze coins with simply ''Βασιλεύς'' (Basileus, "King") on the obverse were minted by either [[Ezana of Axum|King Ezana]] or one of his successors. The coins bore the first example of an Aksumite motto on the reverse, "May this please the people" ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]]: ΤΟΥΤΟΑΡΕΣΗΤΗΧΩΡΑ). It was later written in unvocalized Ge'ez as "ለሐዘበ ፡ ዘየደአ" ''LʾḤZB ZYDʾ'' and under [[Kaleb of Axum|King Kaleb]] also "ለሀገረ ፡ ዘየደአ" ''LHGR ZYDʾ'', "may this please the city [country]." Similar mottoes were used by other kings. Coins of the early 7th-century Emperor [[Armah]] had inscribed on the back "ፈሰሐ ፡ ለየከነ ፡ ለአዘሐበ" ''FŚḤ LYKN LʾḤZB'' (vocalization: ፍሥሓ ፡ ለይኲን ፡ ለአሕዛብ ፡ ''fiśśiḥā la-yikʷin la-'aḥzāb'', "Let the people be glad," lit. "Gladness let there be to the peoples").&lt;ref&gt;Sergew Hable Selassie, ''Ancient and Medieval Ethiopian History to 1270''. United Printers: Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 1972, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endybis===
{{Main|Endybis}}
[[File:KingEndybisEthiopia227-235CE.jpg|thumb|300px|Coins of king [[Endybis]], 227-235CE. [[British Museum]]. The left one reads in Greek "BACIΛEYC AΧWMITW", "Emperor of Axum". The right one reads in Greek: ΕΝΔΥΒΙϹ ΒΑCΙΛΕΥϹ, "King Endybis".]]
Endubis, the first known Aksumite king to mint coins, focused almost entirely on his image on both the obverse and reverse. The images were of his head and upper half of his chest in profile, wearing a regnal headcloth or helmet and abundant jewelry.  In addition to inscribing his regnal name, Endybis also noted his "''bisi'' name, a practice continued by his early successors, but often missing in later coins. The ''bisi'' name was a sort of tribal affiliation or "ethnikon" (i.e. a reference to the king's lineage) that was different for every king.&lt;ref name="Munro154" /&gt; Endybis also emphasized his religion through the pre-Christian symbol of the disk and crescent as a propaganda method (a purpose which the coins already served). A second motif used by Enybis and continued by following coins was that of two (though sometimes one in later years) ears of barley or wheat around the image of his head in profile. Though no inscriptional evidence exists, given its prominent position around the image of the king, the two ears of barley (or wheat) may have been representative symbols of the Aksumite state.&lt;ref name="Munro155" /&gt; Though later coins would be smaller, Endybis chose the Roman aureus to standardize Aksumite coin weights against, with gold issues at half-aureus around 2.70&amp;nbsp;grams (more precisely, the theoretical weight may have been 2.725g).&lt;ref name="Munro154" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Munro159" /&gt;

===Aphilas===
{{Main|Aphilas}}
[[File:Aphilas2.jpg|300px|thumb|Silver coin of [[Aphilas]] with gold inlay.]]
Whereas all of Endubis's coins feature the king with a headcloth or helmet, Aphilas's coins show the king wearing an impressive high [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] on top of the headcloth. The crown featured colonnades of arches supporting high spikes, on top of which rested large discs of unidentified composition. In addition to the crown and headcloth, Aphilas's coins included further images of regalia, such as a spear, a branch with berries, the depiction of the arms, the addition of tassels with fringes to the imperial robe, and more jewelry, such as amulets and bracelets. Despite this innovation, Aphilas continued to use the image of himself in the regnal headcloth in some coins, sometimes as the reverse, while his crowned image is only found on the obverse.&lt;ref name="Munro156"&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', pp.156.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his issues included his frontal image on the obverse, which ended with his reign and was only revived by the late kings. Two other minting features of Aphilas were also abandoned by later rulers.  One of these was the use of just the inscription "King Aphilas" as the reverse of a coin, the only purely epigraphical side ever used on an Aksumite coin. The other was his use of a single ear of [[barley]] or [[wheat]] as a reverse, though his use of two ears circling around the king's image continued.&lt;ref name="Munro158" /&gt;

Aphilas introduced a number of different standards for all three metals, some of which lasted through to the 7th century, while the use of others ended with his reign. His new gold coins (issued in conjunction with the older) of a quarter aureus and eighth aureus were soon abandoned (each are known from only one specimen), and 1/16 aureus coins have been found, though these are more likely to be deliberate debasements to increase profit (Aksumite gold was generally very pure, however).&lt;ref name="Munro158"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Munro157"&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', pp.157.&lt;/ref&gt; Aphilas's silver coin, however, issued at half the weight of the former, became the new Aksumite standard for silver up until the end of coinage. The older coin was presumably more valuable than needed, and the new coin remedied the problem. Aphilas's bronze issue, however, was instead doubled to 4.83&amp;nbsp;grams. The coin's rarity may attest to its quick withdrawal from the market, as is assumed with his quarter-aureus. These two issues are the only one of Aphilas's issues to portray him frontally, rather than in profile.&lt;ref name="Munro158" /&gt;

===Ezana===
{{Main|Ezana}}
[[File:Ezana.jpg|300px|thumb|Silver coin of [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]].]]
During Ezana's reign a major change in both the Aksumite kingdom and its coinage took place as a result of the change of the official religion to [[Christianity]], one of the first states ever to do so. While Ezana's coins in the first half of his reign are almost identical to those of Aphilas, barring minimal weight reductions, those of his second half employ revolutionary designs. With his conversion to Christianity, Ezana began to feature the [[Christian cross|Cross]] on his coins, the first time the Christian cross had ever been featured in coinage in the world. Some of his gold Christian coins are of the weight before [[Constantine I]]'s weight reform in 324, indicating a conversion before this date or perhaps a few years after, as the Aksumite coinage may not have changed weights immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', pp.160.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the adoption of the Cross on his coins came, of course, the abandonment of the [[star and crescent]] symbol on the coins. Later Christian coins reflect the adoptment of the 4.54 g standard by Constantine, with theoretical weights in Aksumite coins likewise dropping to 1.70 g for the gold coins.&lt;ref name="Aksum161"&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum, pp.161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coins of Ezana without any symbol at all have also been found, along with similar symboless coins of his father, [[Ousanas]]. These may reflect a transition in the religion in Aksum when [[Saint Frumentius|Frumentius]] was influencing Ezana's father and gathering Christians in the country, giving weight to the writings of [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]].&lt;ref name="Aksum161" /&gt; The lack of symbol altogether may reflect an uncertainty as how best to exhibit the change in religion of the Aksumite state.&lt;ref&gt;Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', pp.162.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weight standards==

===Gold coins===
The gold coin weighed on average 2.5-2.8&amp;nbsp;grams and was 15–21&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter at the start of issue, in 270-300. This would make it half an Aureus which weighed 4.62-6.51&amp;nbsp;grams at the time of [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]]. The issue of [[Israel of Axum|Israel]] (570-600) weighed 1.5&amp;nbsp;grams and was 17&amp;nbsp;mm in [[diameter]]. The Roman [[solidus (coin)|solidus]] of [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] Tiberius was 4.36-4.47&amp;nbsp;grams. A majority of these coins were found in [[South Arabia]] and not Aksum. The name is unknown so it is referred to as an AU Unit.

===Silver coinage===
Also starting with Endubis these coins were 2.11-2.5&amp;nbsp;grams in weight which is half the weight of a Roman [[antoninianus]] of 3.5-4.5 [[gram]]s. A [[Denarius]] in the early 3rd century was 2.5-3.00&amp;nbsp;grams of 52 percent or less of silver, but the Aksum coins were almost pure silver at first later debased. The name is unknown so it is referred to as an AR Unit.

===Base coinage===
Most bronze and silver coins have mainly been found in Aksum territory, with very few pieces found in [[Judea]], [[Meroë]] and [[Egypt]]. They are based roughly on the size of older Roman [[As (Roman coin)|As]] and [[Sestertius]] in shape and thickness. The design also developed like Roman coins in first being good but then the pictures turn archaic and non recognisable. The name is unknown so it is referred to as an [[bronze|Æ]] diameter in mm Unit, like Æ17 for a coin of 17&amp;nbsp;mm.

==Trade==
At the time of Aksum's minting of currency, the state already had a long trade history with Greece, Rome, the Persian Empire, and India. That coinage began so late is in fact a little surprising. The late use of coinage may be attributed to the lack of a developed economy, required for coinage to be accepted.&lt;ref name="Munro150" /&gt; Most Aksumite coins were found in the large trade centres with very few in remote villages, where trade would be more through [[barter]] and not coinage based.&lt;ref name="Munro152" /&gt; In fact, the motivation for Aksum's initial minting of coins was for foreign trade and markets, as evidenced by the use of Greek on most of its coins.&lt;ref name="Munro154"/&gt; Moreover, gold coins seem to have been intended primarily for external trade, while copper and silver coins probably mainly circulated within the Aksumite empire, as the gold issues generally specified "king of the Aksumites" as title of the Aksumite king, whereas the title of silver and copper issues generally only read "king."&lt;ref name="Munro153"&gt;Munro-Hays, ''Aksum'', pp.153.&lt;/ref&gt; International use of Aksumite coins seems to have begun early on, as coins of King Ezana and even of King Aphilas (the second Aksumite ruler to issue coins) have been found in India.&lt;ref&gt;Paul B. Henze, ''Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia'' (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 31 n.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
During the 7th century, Aksumite power began to fail, and Ethiopian society began to withdraw further into the [[Ethiopian Highlands|highland hinterlands]], with the coastal areas becoming peripheral areas (whereas [[Adulis]] on the coast was once the [[List of second cities|second city]] of Aksum). The coins continued circulation, but were restricted to more local areas such as [[Nubia]], South Arabia and the [[Horn of Africa]].

==Archaeology==
Due to the nature of the coins (e.g. providing kings' names), they have proved essential in constructing a chronology of the Kings of Aksum. An estimated 98 percent of the city of [[Axum|Aksum]]&lt;ref name="IslamO"&gt;Islam Online. [http://www.islamonline.net/English/artculture/2005/07/06.shtml "Axum: The Ancient Civilization of Ethiopia"]. Accessed 21 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; remains unexcavated, and other areas even more so. Through analysis of the number of coins produced and the style of coins, archaeologists have been able to construct a rough chronology, generally agreed upon until the late 6th- and 7th-century kings. Of the 20 Aksumite Kings attested by their coins, inscriptions corroborate the existence of only two, who happen to be the most famous kings: [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] and [[Kaleb of Axum|Kaleb]], both of whose reigns were periods of exceptional prosperity during the height of the Aksumite kingdom.&lt;ref name="Encyc767" /&gt;

Many coins have been found in northern Ethiopia and Eritrea, the central region of Aksum, though Aksumite coins are reported to have been found in [[Arato]] and [[Lalibela, Ethiopia|Lalibela]].&lt;ref name="Munro152" /&gt; Many coins have been also found further afield. Numerous hoards of coins (always gold save one silver coin) have been found in Southern Arabia, much more than in Aksum itself, attesting perhaps to an Aksumite presence in parts of the region (perhaps supporting the use of titles claiming control over parts of South Arabia from [[GDRT]]'s time). The hoards may be the remnants of hoards left in Kaleb's time (perhaps used to pay soldiers), when it was under an Aksumite governor. Outside of the Horn of Africa and [[Arabian Peninsula]], coins have been found as far as [[Israel]], [[Meroe]], Egypt, and India.&lt;ref name="Encyc768" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Munro153"/&gt; Silver and copper coins are mainly found in Aksum, though some can be traced to [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] pilgrim centers.&lt;ref name="Encyc768" /&gt;

In addition to historical evidence, the coins' use of Ge'ez provides valuable linguistic information. Though rarely used, the [[Speech|vocalization]] of Ge'ez sometimes employed on Aksumite coins allows linguists to analyze vowel changes and shifts that cannot be represented in the older [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[abjad]]s such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[South Arabian alphabet|South Arabian]], and earlier, unvocalized Ge'ez.&lt;ref name="Encyc768" /&gt;

'''Angelo de Oliveira Segrillo''' (born October 4, 1958) is a Brazilian historian specialized in Russia and in comparative studies of Russia, the West and [[Brazil]]. He holds a B.A. from [[Missouri State University]], a master´s degree from the Pushkin Institute (Moscow, Russia) and a doctorate from [[Universidade Federal Fluminense]] (Brazil). He is an associate professor of history at the [[University of Sao Paulo]].

Segrillo´s doctoral dissertation — published under the title ''O Declínio da URSS: um estudo das causas'' (“The Decline of the USSR: a study of its causes”) — was the first major Brazilian academic work using first-hand research into the formerly classified Soviet files. He analyzed the decline of the Soviet economy in its last decades not as a purely internal process, but as accompanying (and associated with) the changes in the world economy, which was moving from Fordist to [[Post-Fordism|Post-Fordist]] paradigms. The rigid, vertically oriented Soviet system had been competitive with the West in the decades when the (similarly rigid, vertically oriented) Fordism was paramount. However, when flexible post-Fordist paradigms (such as Toyotism) came along and set new rules for the game, the USSR started having problems of adaptation to these new requirements of flexibility. An abridged version of this argument can be seen in English in a short essay titled ''The Decline of the Soviet Union'',&lt;ref name="usp.br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lea.vitis.uspnet.usp.br/arquivos/artthedeclineofthesovietunionversionforLEAsite.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Decline of the Soviet Union: A Hypothesis on Industrial Paradigms, Technological Revolutions and the Roots of Perestroika |author=Angelo Segrillo |website=Lea.vitis.uspnet.usp.br |accessdate=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable among other books written by Angelo Segrillo in Portuguese are ''Rússia e Brasil em Comparação'' (“Russia and Brazil in Comparison”, a comparative analysis of Russian and Brazilian political parties in the process of democratization since 1985) and ''Rússia: Europa ou Ásia'' (“Russia: Europe or Asia?”, about the debates between Westernizers, Slavophiles and Eurasianists and how these identity questions shape Russia´s foreign policy today between East and West).

Among his works in the English language, Professor Segrillo proposed a new index to measure political and economic democracy in his 2012 article, ''Liberalism, Marxism and Democratic Theory Revisited: Proposal of a Joint Index of Political and Economic Democracy''.&lt;ref name="scielo.br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpsr.org.br/index.php/bpsr/article/view/147/137 |format=PDF |title=Liberalism, Marxism and Democratic Theory Revisited: Proposal of a Joint Index of Political and Economic Democracy |author=Angelo Segrillo |website=Scielo.br |accessdate=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also presented the first complete translation into English of Peter the Great´s original [[Table of Ranks]] in a 2016 paper.&lt;ref&gt;http://lea.vitis.uspnet.usp.br/arquivos/arttableofrankslea.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''‘Awn al-Rafīq Pāshā ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Abd al-Mu‘īn ibn Awn''' ({{lang-ota|عون الرفيق پاشا بن محمد بن عبد المعين بن عون}}; {{lang-ar|عون الرفيق باشا}}, ''{{transl|ar|‘Awn al-Rafīq Bāshā}}''; February 1841{{spaced en dash}}17 July 1905), also known as '''Awn al-Rafiq ibn Muhammad ibn Awn''', was a member of the Awn clan of [[sharif]]s who served as [[Sharif of Mecca|Emir and Sharif of Mecca]] from 1882 to 1905.

==Birth==
He was born in [[Medina]] at the end of Dhu al-Hijjah 1256 AH (February 1841),{{sfn|al-Ghazi|2009|p=84|ref=Ghazi2009}} the fourth son of [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Mu'in|Sharif Muhammad ibn Abd al-Mu'in ibn Awn]] after Abdullah, Ali, and Husayn.{{sfn|Uzuncarsili|2003|p=211|ref=Uzuncarsili2003}}

==Emirate==
In June 1877, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Vali (governor)|vali]] Taqiuddin Pasha appointed Awn al-Rafiq as acting Emir following the death of his eldest brother, Sharif Abd Allah Pasha, who had served as Emir for nearly two decades. Sharif Husayn Pasha, the next eldest of the Awn clan, was appointed to the Emirate and arrived from Istanbul in August. As was customary, the heir-apparent Awn al-Rafiq was then himself summoned to the capital, where he was appointed to the Ottoman Council of State with the rank of ''vezir''.{{sfn|Ochsenwald|1984|p=179}}{{sfn|Dahlan|2007|pp=424–425|ref=Dahlan2007}}{{sfn|Uzuncarsili|2003|pp=223–226|ref=Uzuncarsili2003}} Husayn's tenure as Emir was cut short by his assassination in 1880. Sultan Abdulhamid, who suspected that the late Emir had been conspiring with the British to establish "an Arab government in opposition to the Caliphate", decided not to appoint Husayn's brother, Awn al-Rafiq to the Emirate. He instead appointed the elderly Sharif Abd al-Muttalib ibn Ghalib of the Dhawu Zayd, who had been held in Istanbul for the past two decades following his deposition in 1856. With this transfer of power to the rival clan of Zayd, the Sultan aimed to limit foreign influence and the power of the Awn clan, and to strengthen Ottoman control over the Hejaz. British diplomats attempted to block the appointment of Abd al-Muttalib. Immediately after Husayn's death, James Zohrab, the British consul in Jeddah, wrote to his superiors that British interests demanded the appointment of Awn al-Rafiq, who was "liberal and enlightened", while Abd al-Muttalib was "a fanatical Wahhabee" with a "hatred of Christians and foreigners". The British ambassador to Istanbul, [[Austen Henry Layard]], asked the Sultan not to appoint Abd al-Muttalib, but was told that the decision had already been made. The Sultan did however assure Layard, as well Awn al-Rafiq, that he would be appointed following the death of Abd al-Muttalib.{{sfn|Buzpinar|1995|ref=Buzpinar1995}}{{sfn|Buzpinar|2005|ref=Buzpinar2005}}

In 1882 Abd al-Muttalib was deposed by Osman Nuri Pasha, who unilaterally declared Awn al-Rafiq's younger brother Sharif Abd al-Ilah as Emir. However this was rejected by Sultan Abd al-Hamid, who instead appointed Awn al-Rafiq as Emir, with Abd al-Ilah to serve as acting Emir until his arrival from Istanbul. A telegraph was sent to this effect at the end of Dhi al-Qi'dah 1299 AH (October 1882).

Awn al-Rafiq served as Emir until his death in [[Taif]] on 17 July 1905.{{sfn|Al-Amr|1974|p=131}} He was buried near his brother Abd Allah in the [[qubba]]h (tomb-building) of [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas]].{{sfn|Al-Ghazi|2009|p=166|ref=Ghazi2009}}

'''Ben Abraham''' (born '''Henryk Nekrycz'''; December 11, 1924 –  October 9, 2015) was a Polish-born writer and historian who became a naturalized Brazilian citizen.

He was the son of Abraham Nekrycz and Ida Nekrycz. Abraham was born  in [[Łódź]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. Abraham survived the [[Łódź Ghetto|ghetto in the city]] and the concentration camps during the years of [[Invasion of Poland|German occupation of his country]].

Abraham's parents died in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. After Auschwitz he spent time in three other concentration camps: [[Braunschweig]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Watenstedt|de|3=Watenstedt (Salzgitter)}}, and [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]]. On the night of  May 1, 1945, he was released, weighing {{convert|28|kg|abbr=on}} and suffering from [[tuberculosis]] in both lungs, scurvy and dysentery. Among Abraham's 200 relatives he and his cousin were the only ones who survived.

Ben Abraham spent the next two years being transferred between several American hospitals in Germany, eventually achieving a full recovery. According to him "It was a miracle; that time tuberculosis cure did not even exist".

In 1947, after his recovery he clandestinely immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. There Abraham witnessed another conflict, The War of Independence of the [[Israel]] State. He was not admitted to the army due to his health, so he bought an old truck and worked for the Israeli army as a driver.  &lt;ref name=iai&gt;[http://benabraham.org/pt-br/imigracao-clandestina/ "Imigração a Israel"], at Ben Abraham's official website&lt;/ref&gt;

Abraham arrived in [[Brazil]] on January 21, 1955. On April 28, 1956 he married Miriam Dvora Brik, of a [[Ukrainian Jew]]ish family from [[Lutsk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://benabraham.org/pt-br/vida-no-brasil/ "Vida no Brasil "]&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazil, he was recruited by [[Mossad]] and cooperated with it until mid-90s.&lt;ref name=iai/&gt; He was naturalized as a Brazilian citizen on January 30, 1959.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

For his work and 15 books related to the Holocaust, Abraham received numerous honors as a journalist, including the Golden Key of  [[Yad Vashem]] and the Medal of Honor and Merit of [[University of São Paulo]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://benabraham.org/pt-br/titulos-honorarios-ben-abraham/ "Títulos Honorários "]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Abraham died in São Paulo, just two months before his 91st birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.menorahnet.com.br/morre-em-s-paulo-o-historiador-ben-abraham/|title=Morre em S.

'''Robert Beall Tudor, Jr.''' (May 18, 1935 &amp;ndash; March 14, 2010), known as '''Buddy Tudor''', was an American [[real estate]] developer. Based in [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]], [[Louisiana]], whose family-owned Tudor Construction Company and Tudor Enterprises together surpassed a billion dollars in development. An active member of the [[Baptist Church]], Tudor was also a contributor to the [[Louisiana Republican Party]] and a personal friend of [[David C. Treen]], Louisiana's first [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] [[U.S. representative]] and [[governor of Louisiana|governor]] since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].

==Early years, education, military==

In 1946, Tudor's grandfather, [[Simon W. Tudor|Simon Woodson Tudor]] (1887–1956), a [[Kentucky]] native, founded Tudor Construction Company in Pineville. Tudor Hall, a men's dormitory, at Baptist-affiliated [[Louisiana College]] in Pineville is named for him. After a decade in business, Simon Tudor died, and the company passed to son Robert Tudor, Sr. (1914–1987). Simon Tudor was married to the former Frances Ollie Beall (1894–1992).&lt;ref name=studor&gt;Simon Woodson Tudor,  ''A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography'', Vol. 2 (1988), p. 799&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Robert Tudor, Sr., Lorraine Price Tudor (1915–2009), Buddy Tudor's mother, married Leonard F.

Tudor, Jr., graduated in 1953 from [[Bolton High School (Louisiana)|Bolton High School]] in [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]] prior to the opening of [[Pineville High School (Louisiana)|Pineville High School]]. At Bolton, he played [[basketball]] and [[tennis]] and was the state runner-up in men's singles tennis in both his junior and senior years. As a [[civil engineering]] student at [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] from 1953–1957, he lettered in varsity tennis all four years and was the team captain in 1956 and 1957. He was a member of Sigma Tau Alpha and [[Tau Beta Pi]] national engineering [[fraternity|fraternities]], [[Omicron Delta Kappa]] leadership and scholastic fraternity, and [[Sigma Chi]] social fraternity.

He was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[anti-aircraft]] artillery of the [[United States Army]], with active duty at [[Fort Bliss]] near [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], and [[Fort Chaffee]] near [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], [[Arkansas]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20100316/OBITUARIES/100315008/Robert-Beall-Buddy-Tudor-Jr.|title=Robert Beall Tudor, Jr.|publisher=''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Daily Town Talk]]'', March 16, 2010|accessdate=March 28, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expanding the company==

After military service, Tudor returned to Alexandria-Pineville to join his father as the third generation at Tudor Construction Company and became managing partner in 1961. The company was one of the few Louisiana firms of its kind to operate statewide and then to assume projects out-of-state and across the [[American South]]. The firm established offices in Baton Rouge, [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]] and in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] The company is now owned and operated by John Michael Tudor (born September 22, 1961), great-grandson of Simon Tudor and the representative of the fourth generation of Tudors in charge of the business.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Among the structures developed or constructed by Tudor Enterprises are [[Alexandria Mall]], the [[Rapides Parish Coliseum]] in Alexandria, and the [[Central Louisiana Electric Company]] headquarters in Pineville. He also built or expanded churches: Calvary Baptist and [[Emmanuel Baptist Church (Alexandria, Louisiana)|Emmanuel Baptist]], and First [[United Methodist]] Church, all in Alexandria, and Pineville's First Baptist Church, his own congregation. Other projects are the Rapides Regional Women's and Children's Hospital, Tudor Hall and Guinn Auditorium at Louisiana College, Grande Theatre, and the One Centre Court and Two Centre Court office complexes on Jackson Street in Alexandria. Tudor owned or was the principal developer of downtown Alexandria properties the [[Bentley Hotel]] (since sold), Jackson Place, the Commercial Building, and the Diamond Grill [[restaurant]].&lt;ref name=tudor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20100315/NEWS01/3150317/0/STATE/Prolific-real-estate-developer-Robert-Buddy-Tudor-Jr.-dies|title=Bob Tompkins, Prolific real estate developer Robert "Buddy" Tudor Jr., dies|publisher=''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Daily Town Talk]]'', March 15, 2010|accessdate=March 29, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tudor constructed the tennis courts and the diving pool at the Alexandria Aquatic and Racquet Club. He also assisted in the building of the athletics complex, including tennis courts, at Pineville High School. He often played tennis even with later health problems.&lt;ref name=tudor/&gt;

==Losing Cajundome contract==

During the Treen administration, Tudor lost the contract for the building of the [[Cajundome]] complex in Lafayette to [[Winton M. Blount|Blount Brothers]] of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Alabama]]. Blount was also a Republican, having been [[U.S. Postmaster General]] in the [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon]] administration and his party's unsuccessful U.S. Senate nominee in 1972. [[Ron Gomez]], then a member of the [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana House of Representatives]] from Lafayette, recalled the machinations over the approval of the sports complex, home of the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] [[Louisiana–Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns|Ragin' Cajuns]] team. Treen had expected Tudor to win the Cajundome contract, but he was ostensibly outbid by Blount. However, considering five alternates and other changes in the contract in the end could have made Tudor the lower bidder. The project ultimately was completed in 1985 at a cost of $60 million.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Gomez]], ''My Name Is Ron, And I'm a Recovering Legislator: Memoirs of a Louisiana State Representative'', Lafayette, Louisiana: Zemog Publishers, 2000, pp. 104-105&lt;/ref&gt;

Tudor had contacted Treen's aide, [[John H. Cade, Jr.]], of Alexandria and commissioner of administration [[E.L. "Bubba" Henry]] to ask them to intervene on his behalf. In a letter to Treen, Tudor said that the Cajundome plans "as drawn, reflect the needs of the Lafayette area, and it would certainly be a shame to build something less than that needed which might be outdated before completion. I realize than my arguments may be taken as being strictly self-serving, but I honestly must say that whether we are the successful contractor or not would in no way alter these facts. I know that this is a difficult decision for you."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Buddy Tudor to [[David C. Treen]], quoted in Ron Gomez, ''Recovering Legislator'', p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Treen's long-time Louisiana rival, [[Edwin Washington Edwards]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], appearing at the Central Louisiana Press Club gridiron show, once poked fun at Tudor by saying how happy he was to be in "Tudorville", his [[epithet]] for the Alexandria-Pineville community.&lt;ref name=tudor/&gt;

Though a Republican, Tudor donated $1,000 in 2008 to the reelection of Democratic [[U.S. Senator]] [[Mary Landrieu]] of Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignmoney.com/political/contributions/buddy-tudor.asp?cycle=08|title=Buddy Tudor: Political Campaign Contributions, 2008 Election Cycle|publisher=campaignmoney.com|accessdate=March 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civic leadership==

Tudor was the founding member of Central Cities Development Corporation, which focuses on the revitalization of downtown Alexandria. He was the first chairman of the Rapides Area Planning Commission (1970–1974). He served as President of the Alexandria [[Rotary Club]] (1969–1970), and on the boards of numerous civic organizations, such as the Alexandria-Pineville [[Chamber of Commerce]], the LSU Foundation, the [[Boy Scouts of America]], and the [[Young Men's Christian Association]]. He was active in the "good government" [[interest group]]s, the Council for a Better Louisiana and the [[Louisiana Association of Business and Industry]]. He was also affiliated with the [[industry trade group]], the [[Associated General Contractors]], and the [[non-profit organization]], the [[Urban Land Institute]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In 1970, he was named Outstanding Young Man of the Year in Central Louisiana and one of three such honorees statewide. He received awards from the Louisiana Preservation Alliance and the National Trust for Historic Preservation for his work on the Bentley Hotel and the Diamond Grill.&lt;ref name=tudor/&gt; In 2007, he was awarded the Trustee's Distinguished Service Award by Louisiana College, where his grandfather had been a faculty member and coach prior to entering the construction business.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Family and death==

Tudor was married three times. He was [[divorce]]d from the first wife, now Jane Anne Welch (born 1936) of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]]. He was divorced from his second wife, Patricia Murphy of Baton Rouge. His third and surviving wife is the former Patsy Graham (born November 21, 1959) of Pineville. He had five children from the first marriage, Anne Elizabeth "Lisa" Tudor (born ca. 1957), formerly Anne T. Stoller, of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], Robert B. Tudor, III (born ca. 1959), and wife, the former Phoebe Brian, of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], Texas; John M. Tudor; William A. Tudor (born 1964) and ex- wife Monique of Pineville; and Geoffrey Trever Tudor (born ca. 1966) of Austin, Texas. He is also survived by three stepchildren, Michelle H. Jennings and husband Nathan of [[Fort Hood]] near [[Killeen, Texas|Killeen]], Texas, Justin Michael Hathorn and wife Ali of [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], and Holly Hathorn and her fiancé, Brandon Malone, of Pineville. Other survivors are a sister, Sue Tudor Miller (born ca. 1933), and a brother, [[lawyer|attorney]] Michael Simon Tudor (born January 8, 1945) and his wife, Susan, all of Pineville.

Tudor died at the age of seventy-four at his Pineville home after a 17-year struggle with [[cancer]]. Services were held on March 17 at the First Baptist Church of Pineville, where he had been a deacon and taught [[Sunday school]], with pastor, Dr. Stewart Holloway, officiating. Tudor is interred at Greenwood Memorial Park in Pineville.

== Origin ==
The ''Dacianos'' are cited to have inhabited parts of [[Spain]] for several hundred years and the term itself, along with ''gitanos,'' is a Spanish name for gypsies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They were also identified as the ''Comprachicos'' or ''Comprapequenos'' in Victor Hugo's ''[[The Man Who Laughs]]''.

'''David Feuerwerker''' (October 2, 1912 – June 20, 1980) was a French Jewish rabbi and professor of [[Jewish history]] who was effective in the resistance to German occupation the [[Second World War]]. He was completely unsuspected until six months before the war ended, when he fled to Switzerland and his wife and baby went underground in France. The French government cited him for his bravery with several awards. After the war, he and his wife re-established the Jewish community of Lyons. He settled in Paris, teaching at the Sorbonne. In 1966, he and his family, grown to six children, moved to Montreal, where he developed a department of Jewish studies at the University of Montreal.

==Early life==
He was born on October 2, 1912, at 11 Rue du Mont-Blanc, in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. He was the seventh of eleven children. His father Jacob Feuerwerker was born in [[Sighet]], now Sighetu Marmației, [[Maramureş]], then [[Austria-Hungary]], now [[Romania]]. His mother Regina Neufeld was born in Lackenbach, one of the famous seven Jewish communities or ''Sheva Kehillos'' ([[Siebengemeinden]]) in the [[Burgenland]], Hungary, now Austria.

In 1925, he finished high school at the Rue Vauquelin Talmud Torah. In 1932, after his [[baccalauréat]] in sciences, lettres et philosophie, in Paris, he entered the French rabbinical seminary L'Ecole Rabbinique de France (Séminaire israélite de France, SIF), from which he graduated as a rabbi, on October 1, 1937. He became Diplomé de Langues Sémitiques anciennes ([[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]) as a specialist in [[Semitic languages]]. Among the languages he spoke were [[Aramaic]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]].

==Second World War==

===Military service and recognition===
From October 15, 1937, until September 1, 1939, he served in the French Army, in [[Alsace]]. After World War II broke out, he remained in the army until July 25, 1940. He was in charge of communications for a group of [[artillery]] of the 12th R.A.D. (Régiment d'Artillerie Divisionnaire) and chaplain of the 87th D.I.A. He was demobilized at [[Châteauroux]] on July 25, 1940.

He received the [[Croix de guerre 1939-1945 (France)]] with a bronze star.

The citation to the Order of the Brigade reads as follows:

{{quote|As chief of artillery communications has participated from September 1939 to February 1940 in the engagements in Alsace in the region of [[Bitche]]. Has shown drive, courage, and competence in assuring under fire the phone and radio contacts.

Distinguished himself again during the combats of June 1940 on the [[Ailette (river)|Ailette]], the [[Aisne (river)|Aisne]], and the [[Seine]], as Jewish Chaplain of his [[Division (military)|Division]]. Has contributed to maintain the fighting spirit around him and to uphold the morale of the engaged units.}}

A second citation for the [[Croix de guerre 1939-1945 (France)]] was to the Order of the Army, with palm.

=== Rabbi of Brive and of three départements ===
In 1940, he was nominated rabbi of three French [[Departments of France|Departments]]: [[Corrèze]],&lt;ref&gt;See, [http://www.jewishtraces.org/rubriques/?keyRubrique=le_chateau_du_doux Are There Any Jews in Correze?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227131735/http://www.jewishtraces.org/rubriques/?keyRubrique=le_chateau_du_doux |date=2010-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creuse]], and [[Lot (department)|Lot]], based in [[Brive-la-Gaillarde]]. He lived at Villa du Mont-Blanc, avenue Turgot, in [[Brive]]. He created his first Study Circle (Cercle d'Etudes).

The Jewish population consisted of numerous refugees, including a large segment originating from [[Alsace]] and other regions occupied by the Nazi invader. He helped numerous of them to find a country of refuge, with the help of the oldest agency dealing with refugees in the United States, the [[HIAS]]. Among the destinations, [[Cuba]]. For himself, there was no thought of leaving France, since he was a community leader. He succeeded in liberating many internees from transit camps in France, including the camp at [[Gurs]]. He helped [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] in the pursuit of his studies.&lt;ref&gt;See, Mandelbrot, 2013, p. 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the Résistance ===
In Brive with [[Edmond Michelet]], later to be a senior minister under [[Charles de Gaulle]], he participated actively in the [[French Résistance]] Movement "Combat" against the Nazi occupation. His name in the [[French Résistance]] was "Jacques Portal". He received the [[Croix du combattant volontaire 1939–1945|Croix du combattant volontaire]] 1939–1945, the Medaille Commémorative de la Guerre 1939–1945 with the bar "France".

He was to be made Knight (Chevalier) of the [[Legion of Honor]] ([[Légion d'honneur]]) for his military activities.
The Citation says:

{{quote|Despite the exceptional risks which were attached to his ministry, has participated in an active, permanent and unselfish way to the organisation of the resistance in all the region.

Has not hesitated to risk his freedom, and without any doubt his life, to be for the Movement "Combat" an auxiliary particularly serious.

It's to him that many hundreds of resistants owed their false identification papers which allowed them to escape the searches by the [[Gestapo]].}}

His wife, [[Antoinette Feuerwerker]] (née Gluck), who had finished law school in [[Strasbourg]] before the war, and whom he married at the beginning of the war, participated with him in the underground. Combattant Volontaire de la Résistance, in 1944 she was awarded the [[French Liberation Medal]] (Médaille de la France Libérée), "for her participation in the liberation of France".

=== Jacques Soustelle and the passage to Switzerland ===
Six months before the end of World War II, the Germans finally understood that the Rabbi of [[Brive]] was an active member of the [[Résistance]]. But the Rabbi got ahead of the occupier. After receiving reliable information that he was on the list of people to be arrested by the [[Gestapo]], he decided to act. His arrest and his probable disappearance would not advance the cause he defended, day after day. He took the difficult decision, in agreement with his spouse, [[Antoinette Feuerwerker]], to leave Brive. Only one destination was possible, Switzerland.

Antoinette Feuerwerker obtained from [[Jacques Soustelle]], a future minister of [[Charles de Gaulle]] and later his opponent, but then a leader of the [[Résistance]], information how to reach clandestinely neutral territory, in [[Divonne-les-Bains]]. Once in his native city of [[Geneva]], he was imprisoned by the Swiss authorities. But his life was not in immediate danger. Once Lyon had been liberated, in which he participated, he resumed the task of rebuilding the Jewish community of [[Lyon]] and of France, then in disarray.

Antoinette Feuerwerker had remained in France for the last six months of the war. In order to evade the Germans and [[deportation]], she went underground with her baby daughter, Atara. Once the war ended, the couple reunited in Lyon, for the adventure of reconstruction of the post-war French [[Judaism]].

== Chief rabbi of Lyon, at the Libération ==
He participated in the liberation of [[Lyon]] as the captain-chaplain (Capitaine-Aumônier) of the [[French Forces of the Interior]] (Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur, F.F.I.), In Lyon in 1944. He became the chief rabbi of Lyon at the [[Liberation of France|Liberation]], rabbi of the Great [[Synagogue]] 13, Quai Tilsit, Lyon 2. He became also the captain-chaplain of the Place de Lyon and of the Alpine Division (27&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; brigade d'infanterie de montagne).

He spoke at the ceremony commemorating the Liberation of Lyon, at Place Bellecour.&lt;ref&gt;The Chief Rabbi of Lyon Richard Wertenschlag recalls his father often mentioning that occasion.&lt;/ref&gt;

His activities included liaising with the former [[Prime Minister of France]], [[Édouard Herriot]] and the [[Roman Catholic]] primate of the Gauls, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Pierre-Marie Gerlier]], later, recognized as a [[Righteous Among the Nations]], by [[Yad Vashem]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]].

He published in Lyon, the first weekly Jewish newspaper since the war, called '''L'Unité''' ("Unity").

==After the war==
In 1946, he was elected rabbi in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], near Paris, where he established a Cercle d'Etudes (Study Circle) at 12 rue Ancelle. The money destined for the famous boat [[Exodus 1947]] was hidden, without his knowledge, by his wife, [[Antoinette Feuerwerker]], under his bed, since no one would suspect him.

In 1948, he became rabbi of Les Tournelles, the Great Synagogue in Paris. In the Cercle d'Etudes du Marais he formed at 14 [[Place des Vosges]], in the heart of [[Le Marais]], the lecturers included: [[Raymond Aron]], [[Robert Aron]], [[Henri Baruk]], le [[Père Marie-Benoît]], [[Jean Cassou]], [[Georges Duhamel]], Marcel Dunan, [[Edmond Fleg]], Henri Hertz, [[Louis Kahn (admiral)|Louis Kahn]], [[Joseph Kessel]], Jacques Madaule, Arnold Mandel, [[Szolem Mandelbrojt]], [[François Mauriac]], [[Edmond Michelet]], Pierre Morhange, [[François Perroux]], le Père Michel Riquet, Pierre-Maxime Schuhl, [[André Spire]], [[Jean Wahl]], and many others.

In an assessment of "European Jewry Ten Years After The War", and of France, in particular, Arnold Mandel writes in 1956: "Under the auspices of a very dynamic, forceful and militant rabbi David Feuerwerker a free debating club the Circle du Marais has been active for several years. Situated in one of the most beautiful squares in Paris, the Place des Vosges where the [[Victor Hugo]] Museum is located, the club, where the discussions are sometimes stormy, is one of the liveliest and most picturesque spots in the Jewish quarter of the French capital. It is Hyde Park with more spirit.&lt;ref&gt;See, [https://archive.org/stream/europeanjewryten012394mbp/europeanjewryten012394mbp_djvu.txt European Jewry Ten Years After The War.]&lt;/ref&gt;"

Roger Berg writes&lt;ref&gt;See, p. 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt; en 1992 on the ''Cercle d'Études du Marais'': "Sometime after the end of World War II, and before the sudden emergence of television in homes, study circles were created all over, the most prestigious among them was the Circle of the Marais of David Feuerwerker." The French Jewish Community paid tribute to him, on December 23, 1956, on the occasion of his twentieth year in the Rabbinate and of the two hundred and fiftieth Session of the Cercle d'Etudes du Marais, to as it specified, ''Honor the guide and the master whose activity is creative and efficient for the Jewish Community of France.''

He was the head of Jewish Education (Directeur de l'instruction religieuse) (Paris) (1952), and vice president of the Council for Education and Jewish Culture in France (Conseil pour l'Education et la Culture Juive en France, CECJF) (1953).

The City of Paris, and in its name, the municipal council, in its session of December 14, 1957, awarded to him the Gold Medal of the City of Paris.

==Teacher and orator==
On diverse occasions, his talent as an orator was made to contribution. He participated on a regular basis to the Annual Commemoration at the Memorial of the Unknown Jewish Martyr (Mémorial du Martyr Juif Inconnu), with the attendance of civilian and military authorities. He gave the only funeral oration in French for the famous Rabbi [[Samuel Jacob Rubinstein]] of the Synagogue of the 10 rue Pavée in Paris 4 ([[Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue]]). He spoke at a commemoration on the site of the camp at [[Drancy internment camp|Drancy]]. He spoke also at the Grande Synagogue of Paris, [[rue de la Victoire]] in the [[9th arrondissement of Paris]].

In parallel to his rabbinical activities, he obtained a Licence ès Lettres and a [[Ph.D.]] in history from the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. He taught at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] EPHE 6ème section [[Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes]] from 1962 to 1965.

Among his many lectures, he spoke at the Societé de l'Histoire de Paris, and at the Institut Napoléon de Paris.

He published articles in, among other publications, ''La Revue Historique des Annales''; ''Evidences''; ''Bulletin de nos communautés''; le '' Journal des communautés''.

===Chaplain===
He created the position of chief chaplain of the [[French Navy]]. There had been no Jewish chaplain of the French Navy before him. He was based at the Centre Marine Pépinière, 15 rue Laborde, in Paris 8. He went on special missions in [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]] (at the [[navy base]] in [[Bizerte]]).

He was also chaplain of prisons ([[La Roquette Prisons|La Petite Roquette]]), Lycées ([[Lycée Henri-IV]], [[Lycée Fénelon, Paris|Lycée Fénelon]]) and hospitals ([[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris]]) in Paris.

In 1963, General [[Charles de Gaulle]] nominated him to be officer of the [[Legion of Honor]] ([[Légion d'honneur]]), for his work for the [[French Navy]].

===Hebrew at the Baccalauréat===
He introduced Hebrew as a foreign language for the French [[Baccalauréat]], in 1954. He was the sole examiner for the city of Paris. To this day, it is offered as an option worldwide. Among those who were examined by him, and who remember vividly the questions, was [[Haïm Brezis]], the future member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] (Académie des sciences; France) and of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (USA).

=== Famous contacts ===
He was close to [[Pierre Mendès France]], the former [[Prime Minister of France]]. He led the funerals of both his parents. He befriended and helped Aimé Pallière (1868–1949), who has remained as the [[Noahide]] ([[B'nei Noah]]) par excellence.

Among the many Jewish leaders he met, two made an everlasting impression, Rabbi [[Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz]] (1878–1953), the [[Chazon Ish]], in [[Bnei Brak]], [[Israel]], and the Hassidic leader of [[Belz]], Rabbi [[Aharon Rokeach]] (1877–1957), called Reb Arele, also, living in Israel.

After the Sinai War of 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], when [[Moshe Dayan]] visited France, he represented the Jewish community, at a ceremony under the Arc of Triumph ([[Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile]]), in Paris.

He became the [[rabbi]] of the Synagogue 15 Rue Chasseloup-Laubat ([[15th arrondissement of Paris]]).

==Move to Montreal==
In 1966, he moved with his family (six children: Atara, Natania, Elie, Hillel, Emmanuel, and Benjamine) to [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. He lived at 5583 Woodbury Avenue, in Montreal, a minute away from l'[[Université de Montréal]]. His neighbour, [[René Lévesque]], the future [[premier of Quebec]], paid tribute to him, in his own name, and in the name of the Quebec Government, when he died. He became professor of sociology at the Université de Montréal, from 1966 to 1968, and then created at that university a department of [[Jewish Studies]]. He became judge in the [[rabbinical court]] ([[Beth Din]]) of that city, and a member of the Vaad Hair (Jewish Community Council of Montreal), beside the chief rabbi of Montreal, [[Pinhas Hirschprung]].

He introduced Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] (1895–1986), the halahic authority of his time, to the mayor of Montreal, [[Jean Drapeau]] at the Montreal City Hall. He was the editor of the French section of the ''Voice of the Vaad'' journal, called "la Voix du Conseil".

===Other activities===
Among his many publications, he wrote the classic book on the emancipation of the French Jews, which is still cited today. For this work ''L'Emancipation des Juifs en France de l'Ancien Régime à la Fin du Second Empire'' (Albin Michel: Paris, 1976), he was awarded the Broquette-Gonin Prize for history from the [[Académie Française]]. A review of the book appeared on the [[wikt:front page|front page]] of the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]''.

He appeared on French and Canadian television and radio, was called often as an expert and lectured extensively. He had a special interest in [[Jewish music]]. He organized the appearance of the famous [[Hazzan]] [[Moshe Koussevitzky]], at the Synagogue de la rue des Tournelles, in Paris. He also was a guest on several occasions on the radio show, animated by Alain Stanké, called "La musique des nations" of [[Radio-Canada]].

=== Death in Montreal and burial in Jerusalem ===
He died in Montreal on June 20, 1980, and was buried in [[Sanhedria]] in [[Jerusalem]], Israel.

The '''Duvensee paddle'''&lt;ref&gt;Archaeological Museum Hamburg / Helms-Museum Inventory No: MfV1926.112:182&lt;/ref&gt; is the preserved part of a [[Mesolithic]] spade [[paddle]], which was found during [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavations]] of a Mesolithic dwelling area at [[Duvensee]] near [[Klinkrade]] ([[Herzogtum Lauenburg]]) [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]] in 1926.  After a paddle from [[Star Carr]] in England, the Duvensee paddle is the second oldest known paddle and is considered among the earliest evidence for the use of water transport in the [[Mesolithic]]. The find is in the permanent exhibition of the [[Archäologisches Museum Hamburg|Archaeological Museum Hamburg]] in [[Harburg, Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Topic mobility showcase No. 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Articus | first1 =Rüdiger  | last2 =Brandt | first2 =Jochen | last3 =Först | first3 =Elke | last4 =Krause | first4 =Yvonne | last5 =Merkel | first5 =Michael | last6 =Mertens | first6 =Kathrin | last7 =Weiss | first7 =Rainer-Maria | title =Archaeological Museum Hamburg Helms-Museum: A short guide to the Tour of the Times | series = Archaeological Museum Hamburg publication |publisher= Helms-Museum  | volume =103 | edition = | year=2013 | location = Hamburg | page =98 | isbn =978-3-931429-24-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location of find ==

The former bog Duvenseer Moor was located west of the village Duvensee in a [[Old and Young Drift|young drift]] landscape. The area, of {{Convert|3.5|km|mi}} from north to south and {{Convert|1.2|km|mi}} from east to west, originally was an open, shallow lake which gradually developed to a [[marsh]]. From the late 18th century, the marsh was drained by ditches to make usable for agriculture. The [[peat]] of the bog was cut for fuel. By the early 19th century only a small body of open water remained, which was eventually completely drained. In 1923 the [[geologist]] Karl Gripp discovered by chance a Mesolithic settlement site while [[Geologic map|mapping]] the Duvenseer Moor. In the following years, the site was archaeologically investigated. Archaeologists [[Martin Heinrich Gustav Schwantes|Gustav Schwantes]] (1924–1927), 1946 Hermann Schwabedissen (1946) and finally  Klaus Bokelmann (1966–1967) excavated the bog and documented many dwelling places. Besides numerous [[stone tools|stone artifacts]], the excavations provided only very few wooden tools, including the paddle found by Schwantes in 1926, located in a former bank zone near a residential area. The Duvensee paddle, found at {{coord|53.699171|N|10.54739|E|type:landmark_region:DE-SH|display=inline,title}}, is one of the most outstanding finds from the Duvenseer Moor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jenke | first = Mareike | authorlink = | title = Ausgrabungen im Duvenseer Moor, Kreis Herzogtum Lauenburg - Zur Rekonstruktion einer Altgrabung | journal = Hammaburg N.F. | volume = 16 | pages = 9-78 (here 10-12) | language = German | issn = 0173-0886 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==
The paddle was found broken into several pieces, but except for a few flaws was extremely well preserved. The excellent preservation status of the paddle's wood was caused by a very low level of oxygen in the lake's humid sediments that quickly covered the paddle, which subsequently kept the growth of [[micro organism]]s to a minimum. Under normal oxygen conditions, [[fungi]], [[bacteria]], and [[insect]]s would have caused a biological degradation of the wood in short time. Only the end of the handle is missing and a corner of the paddle's leaf (blade) is broken off. The paddle has a length of {{convert|520|mm|in}}, a width of {{convert|100|mm|in}} and a thickness of {{convert|35|mm|in}}. The leaf has a long rectangular shape with widely rounded corners, having a length of about {{convert|260|mm|in}} and an asymmetric connection to the shaft. The weight of the paddle is {{convert|331|g|oz}}. The paddle was carved from the stem of a [[pine]] tree, with [[Knot (wood)|knots]] smoothed to the shaft. After recovery, the paddle was treated with an unknown [[wax]]y substance for conservation. In the 1920s the paddle was [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|typologically dated]] by [[palynology|palynological]] evidence to the [[Mesolithic]] period. [[Radiocarbon dating]] in the 1980s on several [[Common hazel|hazelnut shells]] and remaining wood from the find spot gave a more precise date of around 7390 ± 80 BC. An [[accelerator mass spectrometry]] (&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; C-AMS) carried out in 2008 on two samples from the paddle yielded [[Calibration|calibrated]] dates to  6527 ± 49 years BC and 6311 ± 38 years BC.&lt;ref&gt;8477 ± 49 BP and 8261 ± 38 BP&lt;/ref&gt; Of note are the distinctly different &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-ages of samples from urban findings.&lt;ref name="Jenke"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jenke | first = Mareike | authorlink = | title = Ausgrabungen im Duvenseer Moor, Kreis Herzogtum Lauenburg - Zur Rekonstruktion einer Altgrabung | journal = Hammaburg N.F. | volume = 16 | pages = 9-78 (here 48-49) | language = German | issn = 0173-0886 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other finds ===

Before 1925, elementary school teacher Ernst Bornhöf, from nearby [[Schiphorst]], found two paddles which he incorporated in his school's prehistoric collection. Both paddles were transferred to the Helms-Museum in 1925. One is a large-leafed paddle&lt;ref&gt;Archaeological Museum Hamburg Inventory No: MfV1931.22:001&lt;/ref&gt; of [[oak]], {{convert|790|*|182|*|35|mm|in}} with a weight of {{Convert|613|g|oz}}. It was &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-dated in 2008 to 1121 ± 22 [[Before Present]] (around 829 AD ± 22 years), the period of transition from the [[Early Middle Ages|early-]] to [[high Middle Ages]]. The second paddle&lt;ref&gt;Archaeological Museum Hamburg Inventory No: MfV1931.22:002&lt;/ref&gt; is now lost, and only a few written records and a photo of the object exist. It was probably made from [[pine]] wood having an incised decoration on the shaft, which is not recognizable in the photo. Both paddles were recovered by Bornhöft without documenting any further detail of the [[archaeological context]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jenke | first = Mareike | authorlink = | title = Ausgrabungen im Duvenseer Moor, Kreis Herzogtum Lauenburg - Zur Rekonstruktion einer Altgrabung | journal = Hammaburg N.F. | volume = 16 | pages = 59–62 | language = German | issn = 0173-0886 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
The results of the excavation enabled a reassessment of Mesolithic cultures in Northern Germany. Schwantes coined the name Duvensee group for the cultural group that extends over Schleswig-Holstein, [[Mecklenburg]] and parts of [[Brandenburg]]. After the excavation Schwantes published the Duvensee paddle as the oldest paddle known worldwide and simultaneously as the oldest, even if only indirect, evidence for the use of boats in the Mesolithic, which was widely viewed. This view has been tempered by the discovery of an older paddle from [[Star Carr]].&lt;ref name="Jenke_9-78"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jenke | first = Mareike | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Ausgrabungen im Duvenseer Moor, Kreis Herzogtum Lauenburg - Zur Rekonstruktion einer Altgrabung | journal = Hammaburg N.F. | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 9–78) | publisher = | location = | date = | language = German | url = | jstor = | issn = 0173-0886 | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The discovery of the Duvensee paddle aroused a huge interest in international archaeological communities, and the museum was asked for a copy of the paddle for the [[1936 Summer Olympics]]. In the 1990s, the community of Duvensee thought about using the paddle in its new [[coat of arms]], but after consultation with heralds, the idea was rejected. After the town won a ''Most Beautiful Village In 2005'' competition, a [[bronze]] replica of the paddle was cast and erected in front of the [[village hall]].&lt;ref name="Jenke_9-78"/&gt;

In [[stratigraphy]] and [[geology]], an '''eonothem''' is the totality of [[Stratum|rock strata]] laid down in the [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] [[geologic record|record]] deposited during a certain [[eon (geology)|eon]] of the [[continuous function|continuous]] [[geologic timescale]]. The eonothem is not to be confused with the eon itself, which is a corresponding division of geologic time spanning a specific amount of (millions of) years, during which rocks were formed that are classified within the eonothem. In practice, the rock column is discontinuous: 

{{cquote|Technically, a complete geologic record doesn't occur anywhere. For such a record to develop would require the area to have been receiving sedimentary deposits continually ever since the origin of the earth. Nowhere is such a situation known to exist. If it did exist, we could not effectively look at the strata because they would still be buried, and modern strata would continue to be deposited on top of them.

The earth's surface has been far too dynamic to allow that to occur anywhere. No area has been in such a static condition throughout the earth's long history. Areas that have had sediment deposited on them at one time are later uplifted and eroded. In some places this has occurred many times. There is ample evidence to prove such a sequence of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-21
|title=An Overview of the Geologic Record|author=Richard Burky,  ©1990 by the [[Worldwide Church of God]].
|url=http://www.wcg.org/lit/booklets/science/burky2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Eonothems, despite discontinuities (locally missing strata or [[unconformity|unconformities]]), can be compared to others where the rock record is more complete and by correlation of points of correspondence be fixed appropriately within the eon. Eonothems are therefore useful as a broad [[chronostratigraphy|chronostratigraphic]] unit, specifying approximate age within the timelines within the rock column. 

Eonothems are subdivided into [[erathem]]s and their smaller subdivisions within [[geology]] and [[paleobiology]] and their sub-fields, and a whole system of cross-disciplinary classification by strata is in place with oversight by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]]. Since oldest rocks are deposited first and lowest in a stratigraphic section, whether one is discussing the rock record is usually clear in context. (A fossil or feature present in the "upper Phanerozoic" eonothem (strata) would be discussed as being dated within the "later Phanerozoic" eon, whereas something found in the middle Phanerozoic could be discussing a layer, stage or the relative time.)

Eonothems are not often used in practice as expert dating estimates can be and usually are specified into the more refined timelines of smaller chronostratigraphic units, which can be subdivided in turn down to the many defined [[stage (geology)|stages]], the smallest units used in dating. ([[#Multidiscipline comparison|see the hierarchy of comparative units]], five each for time division types and five for the rock record types.)

Eonothems have the same names as their corresponding eons, which means during the [[history of the Earth]] only four eonothems were formed. Oldest to newest these are the [[Hadean]], [[Archean]], [[Proterozoic]], and [[Phanerozoic]].

==Dating standards==
GSSAs are defined by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] and are used primarily for time dating rock layers older than 630 million years ago ([[Mya (unit)|mya]]), before a good [[fossil record]] exists. The record becomes spotty at about 542 mya, and the ICS may well have resort to defining additional GSSA's between the two dates. 

For more recent periods, a [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point]] (GSSP), largely based on research progress in [[geobiology]] and improved methods of fossil dating is used to define such boundaries.  In contrast to GSSAs, GSSPs are based on important events and transitions within a particular [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] section.  In older sections, there is insufficient [[fossil record]] or well preserved sections to identify the key events necessary for a GSSP so GSSAs are defined based on fixed dates.

==Etymology==

'''Eonothem''' derives from '''eon''', a [[Latin]] transliteration from the [[koine Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ὁ [[wikt:αἰών|αἰών]]}} (''ho aion'') from the archaic {{lang|grc|αἰϝών}}  (''aiwon''), and '''thema''', "that which is placed or laid down", "subject of a discourse"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sissingh|first=Wim|date=2012|title=Rocky Roads from Firenze: History of Geological Time and Change 1650-1900|url=http://dspace.library.uu.nl:8080/handle/1874/255898|location=Utrecht University|publisher=Utrecht University, Faculty of Geosciences|page=62|isbn=978-90-6266-305-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hirsch studied history at the [[University of Heidelberg]] where he graduated under German historian and political journalist, [[Hermann Oncken]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch,1946&lt;/ref&gt; After university, Hirsch moved to Berlin to pursue a career in journalism at the ''Berliner Tagelblatt'' and later became the editor at the [[Achtuhr Abendblatt]].&lt;ref name=JTA2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1932/05/21/archive/hitlerist-judge-admits-jewish-birth-in-court-changed-his-religion-out-of-conviction-he-says-and-his|title=Hitlerist Judge Admits Jewish Birth in Court Changed His Religion out of Conviction|publisher=JTA|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the rise of [[Nazism]], Hirsch went into exile in America, and completed a librarian degree at [[Columbia University]] in 1936.&lt;ref name=Bard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bard.edu/archives/voices/Felix/felix.htm|title=Felix and Elizabeth Hirsch: Émigré Intellectuals at Bard|publisher=Bard|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently moved to Bard College, where he would teach history and expand the library.

===Kurt Soelling Controversy===
On the 18th May 1932, Judge [[Kurt Soelling]] (born ''Seligsohn''), the Chairman of the Berlin [[District Court]], brought a libel action against Hirsch for an article he wrote in the Achtuhr Abendblatt that revealed Soelling's Jewish identity. Soelling was born into a Jewish family, but baptised a [[protestant]] in later life. He had been a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] but in 1931, declared himself a [[Monarchist]] and became a prominent supporter of the burgeoning [[Nazi party]] and [[Adolf Hitler]]. Hirsch's article not only revealed the judge's Jewish identity, but alleged that he had converted to Protestantism to further his judicial career. Hirsch denounced Soelling as a "dishonest politician".&lt;ref name=JTA1/&gt;

The case concluded on the 19th May 1932, with Soelling admitting that he was of Jewish descent, but that he had converted out of conviction. He explained his activities within the Nazi Party as an attempt to understand the organisation, and justified his use of the Nazi salute by the fact that everyone else at the rallies he attended had used it. Hirsch lost the libel case, and was ordered to pay damages of 500 [[Reichsmark]].&lt;ref name=JTA2/&gt;

According to a dispatch issued by the [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] regarding the intriguing proceedings:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There was something of a sensation in court when it came out in the course of the proceedings that Judge Soelling is the son of the lay head of the Romberg Jewish Community, and that he had held over his baptism until after the death of a rich uncle who was a strictly observant Jew, so that he should not be cut out of his will, and that he had been baptised only after he had received the legacy.&lt;ref name=JTA2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justice Soelling was eventually disbarred and forbidden to practice law in Germany as a result of the Nazis' [[anti-Semitic]] reforms of 1933.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,929527-2,00.html|title=GERMANY: All Fools' Day|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and children===
He married long-term friend, academic [[Elisabeth Feist]] in 1938, and they had two children together. Towards the end of his life, he suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]]. He died in 1982, at a retirement home in Newtown, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/11/classified/paid-notice-deaths-hirsch-elisabeth-feist.html|title=Paid Notice: Deaths HIRSCH, ELISABETH FEIST

The son of Alfred Church Lane and his wife Susanne Foster (Lauriat) Lane, Frederic Lane received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1921, his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from [[Tufts College]] in 1922, where he wrote a master's thesis on "The economic history of Europe during the first half of the sixteenth century",&lt;ref&gt;Tufts University Library catalogue.&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[Ph.D.]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1930 with a doctoral thesis on "Venetian Ships and Shipbuilders of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Harvard University Library catalogue&lt;/ref&gt;  He began his graduate studies at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1923-24, then studied at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1924, before going to [[Harvard University]] in 1925-26. While a Harvard graduate student he was John Thornton Kirkland Fellow for Research in Italy in 1927-28. He married Harriet Whitney Mirick on 4 June 1927. The couple had three children.&lt;ref name="Who"&gt;''Who was Who in America''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
He was appointed instructor in history at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1926,  before being hired at The [[Johns Hopkins University]] as an instructor. There, he served as an assistant professor from 1931 to 1935. Promoted to associate professor in 1936, and full professor in 1946, he retired in 1966 as professor emeritus.&lt;ref name="Who"/&gt;

Lane's research interests focused on the Italian city-state of Venice. His research on the city as a maritime trading center, particularly with his research in economic history, helped establish a standard for examining the development and growth of other Italian city-states. He applied his skills and interests in economic and maritime history to write the history of American wartime shipping during [[World War II]].

From 1951 to 1954, he was assistant director, Social Science division, [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and advised on European policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/k8n50513977xm223/ Gemelli, Giuliana, ''Leadership and Mind: Frederic C. Lane as Cultural Entrepreneur and Diplomat'', in ''Minerva'', vol. 41, #2, June 2003, pp. 115-132]&lt;/ref&gt; He served as historian of the [[U.S. Maritime Commission]], 1946-47.
A member of the [[American Historical Association]], he served as a member of council from 1959 to 1962, and was elected President of the American Historical Association for 1964-1965...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historians.org/info/aha_history/fclane.htm Presidential Address, American Historical Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

Active in a number of other professional organizations, he was editor of the ''[[Journal of Economic History]]'', president of the [http://www.italianhistoricalstudies.org/executive-committee.html Society for Italian Historical Studies] in 1961-63, president of the [[American Historical Association]] in 1965, president of the [[Economic History Association]] 1956-58, and president of the [[International Economic History Association]], 1966-1968. He was a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and of the [[Medieval Academy of America]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3547">'''Giuseppe Bianchini''' (1704 in [[Verona]] &amp;ndash; 1764 in [[Rome]]) was an Italian [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Oratorian]], biblical, historical, and liturgical scholar. [[Pope Clement XII|Clement XII]] and [[Pope Benedict XIV|Benedict XIV]], who highly appreciated his learning, entrusted him with several scientific labors. Bianchini had contemplated a large work on the texts of the Bible, ''Vindiciae Canonicarum Scripturarum Vulgatae latinae editionis'', which was to comprise several volumes, but only the first, in which, among other things, are to be found fragments of the ''[[Hexapla]]'' ([[Codex Chisianus]]), was published (Rome, 1740). Much more important is his ''Evangeliarium quadruplex latinae versionis antiquae'', etc., 2 vols. (Rome, 1749). Among his historical works may be mentioned the fourth volume which Bianchini added to the publication of his uncle, [[Francesco Bianchini]], ''Anastasii bibliotheca rio Vitae Rom. Pontif.'' (Rome, 1735); he also published the ''Demonstratio historiae ecclesiasticae quadripartitae'' (Rome, 1752–54). The chief liturgical work of Bianchini is ''Liturgia antiqua hispanica, gothica, isidoriana, mozarabica, toletana mixta'' (Rome, 1746). He also undertook the edition of the works of B. Thomasius (Tomasi), but only one volume was issued (Rome, 1741).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02541b.htm Giuseppe Bianchini]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition he investigated and wrote an account of the reported [[spontaneous human combustion]] of the Countess [[Cornelia Zangari]] (Verona, 1731, later republished at Rome).&lt;ref&gt;[http://anomalyinfo.com/articles/sa00014.php?page=SHC "Countess Cornelia di Bandi's Fiery Death"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bianchini, G. (1743) ''Parere sopra la Cagione della morte della Comtessa Cornelia Zangari, ne' Bandi Casenate''; 3a ediz. Roma: Ottavio Puccinelli&lt;/ref&gt;

Bianchini examined and described many of biblical manuscripts housed in Italy, such as: [[Minuscule 145]], [[Minuscule 169|169]], [[Minuscule 170|170]], [[Minuscule 171|171]], [[Minuscule 173|173]], [[Minuscule 174|174]], [[Minuscule 175|175]], [[Minuscule 176|176]], [[Minuscule 178|178]], [[Minuscule 179|179]], [[Minuscule 180|180]], [[Minuscule 196|196]], [[Minuscule 394|394]], [[Minuscule 397|397]], [[Minuscule 450|450]], [[Minuscule 627|627]], [[Minuscule 632|632]], [[Lectionary 35]], [[Lectionary 46]], [[Lectionary 123]], [[Lectionary 124]], [[Lectionary 125]], [[Lectionary 126]], [[Lectionary 127]], [[Codex Cyprius]], [[Codex Angelicus]], [[Codex Campianus]], [[Codex Vaticanus 2066]], [[Codex Curiensis]], [[Codex Corbeiensis I]], [[Codex Corbeiensis II]], [[Codex Sangermanensis I]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6394">'''Godfrey of Viterbo'''&lt;ref&gt;Also called Geoffrey of Viterbo, in Italian ''Goffredo da Viterbo'' and in German ''Gottfried von Viterbo'', from Latin ''Gaufridus'', ''Godefridus'' or ''Gotefredus Viterbensis''.&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 1120 – c. 1196) was a [[Roman Catholic]] [[chronicler]], either [[Italy|Italian]] or [[Germany|German]]. From an early age he displayed great activity as one of the clergy at the court of Conrad III and later Frederick I, accompanying the latter on many of his campaigns, and frequently fulfilling for him diplomatic missions.

==Biography==
He was probably an Italian by birth, although some authorities assert that he was a [[Saxony|Saxon]] German like his imperial patrons. He evidently passed some of his early life at [[Viterbo]] in Italy, but he was educated at [[Bamberg]], where he was taken by [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair]] in 1133, gaining a good knowledge of [[Latin language|Latin]], possibly preparing for work in governmental service. Following his education, he began working in the [[Papal Chancellery]]. In the following years he was active in both governmental and [[ecclesiastical]] offices. About 1140 he became [[chaplain]] to the German king, [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]]; but the greater part of his life was spent as secretary (''notarius'') in the service of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick Barbarossa|Frederick I Barbarossa]], who appears to have thoroughly trusted him, and who employed him on many diplomatic errands, traveling extensively throughout [[Europe]], including over forty trips to [[Rome]]. Incessantly occupied, he visited [[Sicily]], [[France]], and [[Spain]], in addition to many of the German cities, in the emperor's interests, and was by his side during several of the Italian campaigns. As a reward for his services at court, lands were bestowed on him in [[fief]], probably in 1169, at Viterbo where he also spent his concluding days.

Both before and after Frederick's death in 1190 he enjoyed the favor of his son, the emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]].

In the politico-ecclesiastical conflicts of his time -the [[Conflict of Investiture]]- he sided with the emperor, without, however, declaring himself inimical to the [[pope]]. He blames [[Pope Alexander III|Pope Alexander]]'s predecessor, [[Pope Adrian IV|Hadrian]], for the [[Schism (religion)|schism]] (see [[Papal election, 1159]]), inasmuch as the latter had allied himself with the [[Byzantine]]s and [[Normans]] against the emperor.

==Works==
His works were for the most part composed during his many official journeys. In light of his duties he was familiar with the highest levels of authority in both circles and collected historical material, in his own words, for over forty years as notary and chaplain to the Emperor Frederick.

About 1183 he compiled for the use of schools his ''Speculum regum,'' dedicated to his [[Hohenstaufen|Staufian]] imperial patrons, father Frederick and son Henry. Here the title ''speculum'', 'mirror' is commonly used for works in the genre of "[[mirrors for princes]]", texts suitable for the royal dedicatees' education. In this case ''regum'' meaning 'of kings' indicates the intention, for future rulers. This history of the world beginning with the [[Genesis flood narrative|deluge]] intended to reconcile the Romans with the Germans.

In his work ''[[Liber universalis]]'' 'universal book', he chronicles world history from the [[Creation narrative in Genesis|creation]] to the time of Henry VI. Godfrey's ''Memoria seculorum'', or ''Liber memorialis'', a world chronicle dedicated to Henry VI, professes to record the history of the world from the creation until 1185 when it was completed. It is written partly in prose and partly in verse.

The ''Memoria seculorum'' was very popular during the [[Middle Ages]], and has been continued by several writers. A revision of this work was drawn up by Godfrey himself from 1185 as ''[[Pantheon (book)|Pantheon]]'', or ''Universitalis libri qui chronici appellantur'', a history of the world which enjoyed an unmerited fame during the Middle Ages. The author borrowed from [[Otto of Freising]], but the earlier part of his chronicle is full of imaginary occurrences. ''Pantheon'' was first printed in 1559, and extracts from it are published by [[L. A. Muratori]] in the ''Rerum Italicarum scriptores, tome vii'' (Milan, 1725). The author, delighting as he does in fables, has gathered much material for the history of folklore.

A work considered particularly valuable is the ''Gesta Friderici I'' (''(res) gesta'' is Latin for 'deeds', a common title for biographical works), verses relating events in the emperor's career from 1155 to 1180. Concerned mainly with affairs in Italy, the poem tells of the sieges of [[Milan]], of Frederick's flight to [[Pavia]] in 1167, of the treaty with [[Pope Alexander III]] at [[Venice]], and of other stirring episodes with which the author was intimately acquainted, and many of which he had witnessed. This metrical account of the achievements of Barbarossa, though not free from confusion, contains some valuable information.

Attached to the ''Gesta Friderici'' is the ''Gesta Heinrici VI'', a shorter poem which is often attributed to Godfrey, although [[Wilhelm Wattenbach]] and other authorities think it was not written by him.

Another minor work is ''Denominatio regnorum imperio subiectorum'', a 'denomination of kings subject to the empire'.

==Life and work==
Haggai Erlich was born to a working-class family in [[Tel Aviv]], was a member of the leftist youth movement [[Hashomer Hatsair]] and studied in the Oriental Class of Tel Aviv municipality secondary school D. He served in the [[Nahal]] paratroops battalion and as a reservist fought in the battle on Jerusalem in 1967 [[Six-Day War]].

In 1989 in the [[World Masters Games]] in Denmark, he came second in the 45 – 50 category, clearing 1.65m. In the 1960s he played basketball in Israel's premier league and in 1997 won the academic staff tennis championship.

Erlich completed his B.A. studies in Tel Aviv University in General History and History of the Middle East and Africa, and his M.A. studies in the [[Hebrew University]] under the guidance of Professor [[Gabriel Baer]] ([[cum laude]], 1969). His thesis was on the tribes of [[Yemen]] and their role in the civil war. In 1973 he received his Ph.D. from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of London]], where he wrote his thesis on the History of Ras Alula, Ethiopia's national hero, under the guidance of professors Richard Gray and [[Edward Ullendorff]].

Erlich taught in Tel Aviv University from 1973 till his retirement in 2004. He served there as head of graduate studies in the Middle Eastern History Department, School of History. He was a visiting professor at Concordia, Montreal, 1978–1979, [[Georgetown University]], 1985–1986 and 1992–1992, and in [[San Diego State University]], 1999-2000. He is an associate editor of Northeast African Studies, Michigan, a member of the International Committee of Ethiopian Studies, the "field expert" on Islam and the Middle East in Encyclopaedia Aethiopica, Hamburg, and the head of the editorial board of the journal of Israel's Association of Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies (MEISA), Hamizrah Hehadash. From 1983 he has headed the development of Middle Eastern studies in the Open University of Israel.

In 2004 Erlich retired as emeritus from Tel Aviv University and intensified his involvement in the Open University.  The program he developed from 1983, based on ten volumes of introduction he wrote himself, was recognized in 2007 by the Higher Education Council of Israel as a BA program in "the Middle East and its Cultures". It combines the study of the history of Arab-Islamic societies with those of other societies in the region. Erlich heads a committee at the Open University, tasked with facilitating studies for Arab students; in this context, he is also in charge of translating ten of the courses in various fields into Arabic.  In the Open University he also developed Ethiopian studies and for the purpose wrote three introductory books in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mideast.tau.ac.il/Faculty/Erlich/erlich_cv.doc Erlich CV] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111040041/http://www.mideast.tau.ac.il/Faculty/Erlich/erlich_cv.doc |date=January 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
Erlich studies focus on [[Ethiopia]], on the modern [[Middle East]], and on the connections and the relations between these histories.  His studies on Ethiopia deal mainly with the internal ethnic dynamism between [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigreans]] and [[Amhara people|Amhara]] and the country's political culture as a factor in Ethiopia's survival in facing European imperialism. His studies on the Middle East deal mainly with the development of higher education and the role of students in politics. His studies on the relations between Ethiopia and the Middle East – a field he is pioneering — reconstruct the history of major strategic meeting points and focus mainly on the conceptual Islamic-Christian dimensions and the religious historical legacies which inspired and continue to influence those relations.

===''Ethiopia and Eritrea, Ras Alula, 1875–1897''===
A biography of Ethiopia's national hero, [[Ras Alula]], the general and statesman who played a central role in Ethiopia's struggle for survival in facing late 19th century imperialism. In this context the book analyzes Ethiopia's relations with Egypt, the [[History of Mahdist Sudan|Mahdist Sudan]], the Italians, and the British during the [[Scramble for Africa]], and attempts at explaining Ethiopia's victories. In the same context it analyzes Ethiopia's home affairs of the time, mainly Tigrean-Shoan relations, the establishment of Asmara and late 19th century Eritrean history.

===''The Struggle Over Eritrea, 1962–1978''===
Analysis of the birth of the Eritrean nationalist movement and fight for independence. It focuses mainly on the internal struggles of the Eritreans as they were interwoven with two simultaneous developments: the internal affairs of Ethiopia during the time of Haile Sellassie and the beginning of Mangistu's period; and the relevant developments in the Arab world and the Arab-Israeli conflict of the time.

===''Ethiopia and The Challenge of Independence''===
A collection of twelve articles which had been published in various journals, all revolving around the Ethiopian modern experience, and which in sequence constitute an attempt at understanding the country's unique success at maintaining independence.

===''Students and University in Twentieth Century Egyptian Politics''===
This book follows two dimensions in the history of Egypt's modernization. One is the
development and the evolution of the University as both a national concept and an educational institution. It reconstructs the role of politicians in shaping higher education from the 1908 establishment of the Egyptian University to [[Anwar Sadat]]’s revolutionary expansion of the education system. The other dimension is the role of students in politics. The book analyses the influence of the higher education system on the creation of the students as an active sociopolitical class; it surveys the students’ role in major historic junctures, and describes the pivotal role of the educated youth in the making of the country's modern politics.

===''Introduction to Modern History of the Middle East''===
A five volume history of the Middle East from 18th century developments in the [[Ottoman Empire]] to World War I, and the establishment of the modern states of the Middle East. The narrative follows stages of modernization culminating with the emergence of modern nationalists ideas and movements, and is accompanied by hundreds of short informative articles and hundreds of authentic illustrations.

===''Ethiopia and the Middle East''===
A discussion of the relations between Ethiopia and the Oriental Middle East from medieval times to the present. It follows two interwoven aspects. One is the reconstruction of major junctures of political connections and strategic collisions. The second is the analysis and evolution of the basic mutual concepts and images which were shaped in earlier formative stages and have been reshaped in later confrontations to be transmitted to the conceptual reservoir of today's Ethiopian, Egyptian and Arab nationalism.

===''The Middle East Between the World Wars''===
Five volumes surveying  the history of the Middle East from the aftermath of World War I to the end of World War II. The series analyses the "Parliamentarian" 1920s and "The Crisis of the 1930s" focusing mainly on the dynamism of inter-generational tensions as a key to sociopolitical and ideological changes. In so doing the series surveys developments in each of the major countries, but also attempts to narrate the history of the region as the home of a common Islamic-Arab civilization. Volume 5 (''The Middle East During World War II'', 2003) analyzes  the same inter-generational tensions in Arab societies during the war, the anti-British activities on the one hand and the final victory (as of 1942) on the other hand of the elite groups leading to the emergence of the rather conservative [[Arab League]] (1945).

===''Ethiopia: an Empire and a Revolution''===
A history of Ethiopia from the early medieval Aksumite dynasty to the 1990s as analyzed mainly along  the competition  between centralizing concepts and institutions (“the Amahara thesis”) on the one hand, and the pluralistic, de-centralist concepts of culture and politics (“the Tigrean thesis”) on the other hand. The narrative also attempts to explain the ability of this Christian dominated society to retain, over that long history, its political sovereignty in facing both imperial Islam and Western imperialism.

===''Youth and Politics in the Middle East – Generations and Identity Crises''===
A discussion of modern Middle Eastern history as developing around the role of higher education (and its various architects) in shaping new “political generations” in Arab societies, and the role of such “political generations” - mainly those of 1906, 1919, 1935, and the 1970s — in offering and struggling for renewed interpretations of both politics and identity.

===''The Nile – Histories, Cultures, Myths''===
This book was edited by Erlich with Israel Gershoni. It is a collection of 18 articles contributed by some of the world's leading scholars of Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia, of Islam and of Eastern Christianity. These articles were originally presented in a 1997 international conference held in Tel Aviv University and in Jerusalem under the same title. The introduction, written with co-editor (and co-organizer) Professor Israel Gershoni, presents the main theme of the book: the role of the [[River Nile]] in  communicating, but also separating between its various riparian cultures and societies. The various chapters discuss the main Nile countries’ common world of inter-relations, mutual images and myths, their image in medieval and modern Europe, and the various historical backgrounds to today's crisis of the Nile's waters.

===''The Cross and the River – Ethiopia, Egypt and the Nile''===
A history of sixteen centuries of relations is analyzed, revolving around dimensions of mutual dependence: Ethiopia being the main source of Egypt's Nile, and Egypt being the main source of Ethiopia's Christianity. The complexities of good neighborliness and conflicts, of suspicions, myths and wars, of religious and cultural interpretations of the “self” and the “other”, is discussed from the 4th century creation of Ethiopia as a bishopric of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria#Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Egyptian Church]] to today's Egyptian and Ethiopian anxieties over the future of the Nile waters.

===''Ethiopia – Christianity, Islam, Judaism''===
This book was written by Erlich with Steven Kaplan and Hagar Salamon. It is a detailed history of Ethiopia's religious history, and a discussion of the Ethiopian interpretation of each of its three belief systems, their local institutions, and their inter-relations. An introduction (by H. Erlich, the general editor) summarizes the flexible, non-essentialist nature of Ethiopia's religiosity. “Christianity” (by Professor Steven Kaplan) analyzes the history and many faces of the country's hegemonic religion. “Islam” (H. Erlich) discusses its role among ethnic minorities and on the margins of society, and ends with its apparent revolution and penetration into the core as of the 1990s. “Judaism” (by Hagar Salamon)  surveys “Beta Israel’s" culture against the historical Ethiopian context.

===''Egypt – The Older Sister''===
The first volume of the Open University's new series ''The Middle East in Our Time''.  The series’ twelve volumes, authored by leading Israeli scholars (with H. Erlich as chief editor) will cover the history of the region's various states from 1945 to the 1980s, (each volume concluding with a succinct analysis to 2000). ''The Older Sister''’s introduction surveys Egypt's leading role in shaping modern developments in the Middle East and in influencing the all-regional periodization of the post World War II era. The book’s three parts are devoted to a detailed analysis of “The End of the Parliamentarian Era, 1945–1952”, “Nasser and Nasserism, 1952–1970”, and “Sadat – The Return to Egyptianism, 1970 - 1981”. The pivotal theme is the ever-dynamic interplay between the various social and political forces in Egypt and the country's various identities – Islamic, Arab, Egyptian.

===''Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia  – Christianity, Islam and Politics Entwined''===
A history of modern relations between the [[Wahhabi|Wahhabi-Islamic]] state and Ethiopia, beginning in the 1930s and culminating in today's radicalization of Islam in the region and Ethiopia's transformation from a “Christian island” into a multicultural state. The narrative follows the development of strategic relations ever since Mussolini's conquest of Ethiopia through the [[Ogaden War]] and local activities of the terrorism networks of the 1990s. The conceptual dilemmas of Ethiopia's Christian establishments, of Ethiopia's Muslim communities and of the Saudis are analyzed as they have developed along and influenced these processes.

===''Ethiopia – History of a Siege Culture''===
An analytical survey of Ethiopia's history from early Aksumite period to today's developments. The first part of the book discusses the medieval foundations of the country's political culture; the second part focuses on the late 19th century victory of Ethiopia over both European imperialists and local neighbors; and the third part explains the price paid for these formative victories – the entrenchment of traditional structures and concepts as shapers of Ethiopia to 1974. The fourth part analyzes the communist revolution under [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] (to 1991) as a recycling of the medieval siege culture in a new cloak, and argues that today's opening to both the outside world as well as to internal diversity and free economy is the first authentic revolution in the country's history.

===''Islam and Christianity in the Horn of Africa, Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan''===
Tracing the modern history of the region where the two religions first met, and where they are engaged now in active confrontation, this book surveys the political developments in the Horn of Africa since the late nineteenth century. The analysis combines the factual changes with an exploration of the ways in which religious formulations of the nearby "other" influenced policymaking and were also reshaped by it. It demonstrates how initial Islamic and Christian concepts remain directly relevant in the region today.

===Generations of  Rage – University and Students in the  Middle East===
A detailed  analysis of the development of higher education in the region combined with discussion of the rule of students in changing the Middle East along eight major historical  junctures, from the rise of modern nationalist movements  to the Arab Spring.

===Alliance and Alienation – Ethiopia and Israel in the Days of Haile Selassie===
A discussion of the special relations between what used to be a Christian empire and the Jewish state of Israel. Analyzing  the legacies of old religious messages and their influence on modern strategic relations the book, based on new archival material, sheds new lights on an African-Middle Eastern drama which began with great promise and ended disastrously in 1973.

A '''hybrid word''' or '''hybridism''' is a [[Word (linguistics)|word]] that [[etymology|etymologically]] derives from at least two  languages.

==Common hybrids==
The most common form of hybrid word in [[English language|English]] combines [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] parts. Since many [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es in English are of Latin or Greek etymology, it is straightforward to add a prefix or suffix from one language to an English word that comes from a different language, thus creating a hybrid word.

== English examples ==

=== Modern Hebrew ===
Modern Hebrew abounds with non-Semitic derivational affixes, which are applied to words of both Semitic and non-Semitic descent. The following hybrid words consist of a Hebrew-descent word and a non-Semitic descent suffix:&lt;ref name="Hybridity versus Revivability"&gt;Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2009), [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns]. In ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2: 40–67, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''bitkhon-íst''' ({{Hebrew|ביטחוניסט}}) 'one who evaluates everything from the perspective of national security', from ''bitakhón'' 'security' + the productive internationalism ''-ist''
*'''khamúda-le''' ({{Hebrew|חמודה׳לה}}) 'cutie (feminine singular)', from ''khamuda'' 'cute (feminine singular) + ''-le'', endearment diminutive of Yiddish descent
*'''kiso-lógya''' ({{Hebrew|כיסאולוגיה}}) 'the art of finding a political seat (especially in the Israeli Parliament)', from ''kisé'' 'seat' + the productive internationalism ''-lógya'' '-logy'
*'''maarav-izátsya''' ({{Hebrew|מערביזציה}}) 'westernization', from ''maaráv'' 'west' + the productive internationalism ''-izátsya'' '-ization' (itself via [[Russian language|Russian]] from a hybrid of Greek -ιζ- ''-iz-'' and Latin ''-atio'')
*'''miluím-nik''' ({{Hebrew|מילואימניק}}) 'reservist, reserve soldier', from ''miluím'' 'reserve' (literally 'fill-ins') + ''-nik'', a most productive agent suffix of Yiddish and Russian descent

Examples of Modern Hebrew hybrid words with an international prefix include:
*'''anti-hitnatkút''' ({{Hebrew|אנטי־התנתקות}}) 'anti-disengagement'
*'''post-milkhamtí''' ({{Hebrew|פוסט־מלחמתי}}) 'postwar'
*'''pro-araví''' ({{Hebrew|פרו־ערבי}}) 'pro-Arab'

Some hybrid words consist of both a non-Hebrew word and a non-Hebrew suffix of different origins:
*'''shababnik''' ({{Hebrew|שבבניק}}) 'rebel youth of [[Haredi Judaism]]', from Arabic ''shabab'' (youth) and ''-nik'' of Yiddish and Russian descent

Modern Hebrew also has a productive derogatory prefixal '''shm-''', which results in an 'echoic expressive'. For example, '''[[Um-Shmum|um shmum]]''' ({{Hebrew|או״ם־שמו״ם}}), literally 'United Nations shm-United Nations', was a pejorative description by Israel's first Prime Minister, [[David Ben-Gurion]], of the [[United Nations]], called in Modern Hebrew ''umot meukhadot'' ({{Hebrew|אומות מאוחדות}}) and abbreviated '''um''' ({{Hebrew|או״ם}}). Thus, when an Israeli would like to express his impatience with or disdain for philosophy, s/he can say ''filosófya-'''shm'''ilosófya'' ({{Hebrew|פילוסופיה־שמילוסופיה}}). Modern Hebrew '''shm-''' is traceable back to [[Yiddish]], and is found in English as well as [[shm-reduplication]]. This is comparable to the Turkic initial m-segment conveying a sense of 'and so on' as in Turkish '''''dergi mergi''' okumuyor'', literally 'magazine "shmagazine" read:NEGATIVE:PRESENT:3rd.person.singular', i.e. '(He) doesn't read magazine, journals or anything like that'.&lt;ref name="Hybridity versus Revivability" /&gt;

=== Japanese ===
In Japanese, hybrid words are common in [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|kango]] – words formed from [[kanji]] characters – where some of the characters may be pronounced using Chinese pronunciations (''on'yomi,'' from Chinese morphemes), and others in the same word are pronounced using Japanese pronunciations (''kun'yomi,'' from Japanese morphemes). These are known as ''jūbako'' (重箱) or ''yutō'' (湯桶) words, which are themselves examples of this kind of compound (they are [[autological word]]s): the first character of ''jūbako'' is read using ''on'yomi'', the second ''kun'yomi'', while it is the other way around with ''yutō''. Other examples include 場所 ''basho'' "place" (''kun-on''), 金色 ''kin'iro'' "golden" (''on-kun'') and 合気道 ''aikidō'' "the martial art [[Aikido]]" (''kun-on-on''). Some hybrid words are neither ''jūbako'' nor ''yutō'' (縦中横 ''tatechūyoko'' (''kun-on-kun'')). Foreign words may also be hybridized with Chinese or Japanese readings in slang words such as 高層ビル ''kōsōbiru'' "high-rise building" (''on-on-katakana'') and 飯テロ ''meshitero'' "food terrorism" (''kun-katakana'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2197">'''Ibn Bassam''' or '''Ibn Bassam Al-Shantarini''' (1058-1147) was a [[poet]] and historian from [[al-Andalus]]. He was born in [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] (sometimes spelled Shantarin or Xantarin) and died in 1147.

Ibn Bassam describes how the incessant invasions of the Castillans forced him to run away from [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] in [[Portugal]], "the last of the cities of the west," after seeing his lands ravaged and his wealth destroyed, a ruined man with no possessions save his battered sword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?articleID=729 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305133942/http://muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=729 |archivedate=2011-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially well-known is  his  anthology "''Dhakhira fî mahâsin ahl al-Gazira''" (The Treasury concerning the Merits of the People of Iberia) one of the most important sources of information in the field of history, literature and culture of the [[Almoravid]] dynasty. It was edited in eight volumes by Ihsan Abbas, written in rhymed prose, many of its biographies are contemporary and filled out with details taken from the Kitab al-Matin of [[Ibn Hayyan]]. The parts taken from that book are easily distinguishable, because Ibn Bassam prefixes the words qala Ibn Hayyan ("Ibn Hayyan says") and concludes the extract with intaha kalam Ibn Hayyan ("here ends lbn Hayyan's words").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12242">[[File:Ica stones3.JPG|thumb|right|300px|An Ica stone allegedly depicting dinosaurs.]]

The '''Ica stones''' are a collection of [[andesite]] stones found in [[Ica Province]], [[Peru]] that bear a variety of diagrams. Some of them supposedly have depictions of [[dinosaur]]s, and what is alleged to be advanced [[technology]]. These are recognised as modern curiosities or [[hoax]]es.

From the 1960s Javier Cabrera Darquea collected and popularized the stones, obtaining many of them from a farmer named Basilio Uschuya. Uschuya, after claiming them to be real ancient artifacts, admitted to creating the carvings he had sold and said he produced a [[patina]] by baking the stone in cow dung.

==Description==
The stones are composed of [[andesite]]. They vary in size from 3x2.5x1.5&amp;nbsp;cm to 40&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt; As a result of weathering, they have developed a thin [[patina]]. It consists of a [[weathering rind]] in which weathering has turned some of the [[feldspar]] into [[clay]], resulting in a softer material, rated 3 to 4 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]], which can be scratched.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt;

They are shallowly [[engraving|engraved]] with a variety of images, some directly incised, others by removing the background, leaving the image in [[relief]]. The images vary from simple pictures on one side of a pebble, up to designs of great complexity. Some of the designs are in styles which can be recognized as belonging to the [[Paracas culture|Paracas]], [[Nazca culture|Nazca]], [[Tiwanaku]], or [[Inca]] cultures.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt;

Some of the images are of flowers, fish, or living animals of various sorts.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt; Others appear to depict scenes&lt;ref name = Skepdic&gt;{{cite book |author=Carroll, Robert T. |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |title=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]: a collection of strange beliefs, amusing deceptions, and dangerous delusions |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=2003 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 169–71]|isbn=0-471-27242-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}, also online at [http://www.skepdic.com/icastones.html skepdic]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fortean&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coppens |first=P |title=Jurassic library - The Ica Stones |journal=[[Fortean Times]] |date=October 2001 |url=http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/259/jurassic_library_the_ica_stones.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827173630/http://forteantimes.com/features/articles/259/jurassic_library_the_ica_stones.html |archivedate=2008-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which would be anachronistic in [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] art, such as knowledge of dinosaurs, advanced medical works and maps.&lt;ref name="Carroll2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Robert|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC|accessdate=8 December 2013|date=2011-01-11|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118045633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Archaeological remains show evidence of Peruvian cultures going back for several thousand years. At some later stages, the whole of modern Peru was united into a single political and cultural unit, culminating in the [[Inca Empire]], followed by the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish conquest]]. At other stages, areas such as the [[Ica Valley]], a habitable region separated from others by desert, developed a distinctive culture of its own.&lt;ref name=Lanning&gt;{{cite book|title = Peru before the Incas| first=Edward P.| last=Lanning| publisher=Prentice-Hall| year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations in [[Ica Province]] were carried out in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by scholars such as [[Max Uhle]], [[Julio C. Tello]], [[Alfred L. Kroeber]], [[William Duncan Strong]] and [[John Howland Rowe]]. None of them reported the discovery of carved andesite stones. Nevertheless, carved stones which had been looted by ''huaqueros'', grave robbers, began to be offered for sale to tourists and amateur collectors.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a&gt;Pezzia Assereto, A (1968)  Ica y el Perú Precolombino. Tomo I. Arqueología de la provincia de Ica. Empresa Editora Liberia, Ojeda, Venezuela. 295 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these collectors was Santiago Agurto Calvo, an architect by profession, who was [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the [[National University of Engineering]] in [[Lima]]. He organised searches in ancient cemeteries, and in August 1966 found such a stone in the Toma Luz sector, Callango district, in [[Ica Valley]]. The context corresponded to the [[Tiwanaku]] culture. He reported his discovery to the Regional Museum in [[Ica city]], and was accompanied on further expeditions by its curator, the  archaeologist Alejandro Pezzia Assereto.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt; In September 1966 in Uhle Hill cemetery, De la Banda sector, [[Ocucaje District]], they found, for the first time, an engraved stone with certain provenance in a tomb of the [[Paracas culture]]. This stone was a fairly flat and irregular in shape, approximately 7 x 6 x 2&amp;nbsp;cm in size. On it was carved a design which might be abstract, or could be taken as a flower with eight petals.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt; Agurto published the discovery in a Lima newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Santiago Agurto Calvo. "Las Piedras Magicas de Ocucaje". ''El Comercio''. Lima, 11 December 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

Pezzia continued to search. In the ''San Evaristo'' cemetery in Toma Luz, he found a carved stone of similar size to the previous one, with a realistic image of a fish. The context dated the tomb to the [[Middle Horizon]] (600-1000 A.D.). In a grave not far away in the same cemetery, he found a stone with the fairly realistic design of a [[llama]], in a context typical of the Ica culture. In 1968, Pezzia published his findings, including drawings and descriptions.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt;

==Popularization by Cabrera==
[[File:Ica stones1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A collection of Ica stones surrounding a portrait of Javier Cabrera]]

Meanwhile, in 1966, Peruvian physician Javier Cabrera Darquea was presented with a stone that had a carved picture of a fish, which Cabrera believed to be of an extinct species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Message of the Stones |last= Cabrera |first= Javier |location= Ica, Peru |url= http://members.cox.net/icastones/02a-book-chapter-1.htm |accessdate= 10 May 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20111202175320/http://members.cox.net/icastones/02a-book-chapter-1.htm |archivedate= 2 December 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cabrera's father had begun a collection of similar stones in the 1930s, and based on his interest in Peruvian prehistory, Cabrera began collecting more.  He initially purchased more than 300 from two brothers, Carlos and Pablo Soldi, who also collected pre-[[Inca Empire|Incan]] artifacts, who claimed they had unsuccessfully attempted to interest [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] in them.  Cabrera later found another source of the stones, a farmer named Basilio Uschuya, who sold him thousands more.  Cabrera's collection burgeoned, reaching more than 11,000 stones in the 1970s.&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt; Cabrera published a book, ''The Message of the Engraved Stones of Ica'' on the subject, discussing his theories of the origins and meaning of the stones. In this he argued that the stones show "that man is at least 405 million years old" and for what he calls ''gliptolithic'' man, humans from another planet, and that "Through the transplantation of cognitive codes to highly intelligent primates, the men from outer space created new men on earth." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cabrera|first=Javier|title=The message of the engraved stones of Ica|year=2000|url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL16716029M/The_message_of_the_engraved_stones_of_Ica}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ica stones achieved greater popular interest when Cabrera abandoned his medical career and opened a museum to feature several thousand of the stones in 1996.&lt;ref name = Skepdic/&gt;

In 1973, during an interview with [[Erich von Däniken]], Uschuya stated he had faked the stones that he had sold.&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt;  In 1975 Uschuya and another farmer named Irma Gutierrez de Aparcana confirmed that they had forged the stones they gave to Cabrera by copying the images from comic books, text books and magazines.&lt;ref name = Skepdic/&gt;  Later, Uschuya recanted the forging story during an interview with a German journalist, saying that he had claimed they were a hoax to avoid imprisonment for selling [[Artifact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]]. In 1977, during the [[BBC]] documentary ''Pathway to the Gods'', Uschuya produced an Ica stone with a dentist's drill and claimed to have produced a fake patina by baking the stone in cow dung.&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt;  That same year, another BBC documentary was released with a skeptical analysis of Cabrera's stones, and the new-found attention to the phenomenon prompted Peruvian authorities to arrest Uschuya, as Peruvian law prohibits the sale of archaeological discoveries. Uschuya recanted his claim that he had found them and instead admitted they were [[hoax]]es, saying "Making these stones is easier than farming the land." He engraved the stones using images in books and magazines as examples and knives, chisels and a dental drill.&lt;ref name=" Feder 2010a"&gt;[[Kenneth L. Feder]], ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis To The Walam Olum'', pages 143 (Greenwood, 2010). {{ISBN|978-0-313-37919-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that he had not made all the stones. He was not punished, and continued to sell similar stones to tourists as trinkets.&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt;  The stones continued to be made and carved by other artists as forgeries of the original forgeries.&lt;ref name = Skepdic/&gt;

==Impact==
Except in the rare cases that [[provenance]] is known, there is no reliable way of dating the stones.&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt; Thus, a stone of uncertain origin can never be used to establish a conclusion which would otherwise be considered unlikely. The stones have been used by some [[Creationism|creationists]] to claim that humans lived in proximity with dinosaurs, which contradicts evidence that the [[extinction of dinosaurs]] predates mankind by approximately 66 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What really happened when the dino killer asteroid struck?|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160415-what-really-happened-when-the-dino-killer-asteroid-struck|website=BBC.com|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one official creationist source has rejected their use as an argument for creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ica Stones Bad Arguments|url=https://creation.com/ica-stones-bad-arguments|website=creation.com|publisher=Creation Ministries International|accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believers in [[ancient astronauts]] have also attempted to use the stones as evidence of a lost, advanced civilization brought to man from other planets&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt; and mytho-historians have claimed them as evidence that ancient myths are accurate histories, neither of which is a position supported in the scientific or academic communities.&lt;ref name = Skepdic/&gt;

In his ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis To The [[Walam Olum]]'', archaeologist [[Ken Feder]] commented "The Ica Stones are not the most sophisticated of the archaeological hoaxes discussed in this book, but they certainly rank up there as the most preposterous."&lt;ref name=" Feder 2010a"/&gt;

'''Jespersen's Cycle''' (JC) is a series of processes in [[historical linguistics]], which describe the historical development of the expression of [[negation (linguistics)|negation]] in a variety of languages, from a simple pre-verbal marker of negation, through a discontinuous marker (elements both before and after the verb) and in some cases through subsequent loss of the original pre-verbal marker. The term originated in the 1979 publication ''Typology of Sentence Negation'' by Swedish linguist [[Östen Dahl]].&lt;ref name="dahl"&gt;{{cite journal
|last=Dahl
|first=Östen 
|title=Typology of Sentence Negation
|year=1979
|journal=Linguistics
|volume=17
|pages=79–106
|doi=10.1515/ling.1979.17.1-2.79
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl coined it in recognition of the pioneering work of [[Otto Jespersen]]{{sfn|Jespersen|1917}} in identifying this pattern of language change.

==Introduction==

The linguist [[Otto Jespersen]] began his book ''Negation in English and Other Languages''{{sfn|Jespersen|1917}} with the words:
{{blockquote|The history of negative expressions in various languages makes us witness the following curious fluctuation: the original negative adverb is first weakened, then found insufficient and therefore strengthened, generally through some additional word, and this in turn may be felt as the negative proper and may then in the course of time be subject to the same development as the original word.}}

The process has since been described for many languages in many different families, and is particularly noticeable in languages which are currently at stage II (both the original and the additional word obligatory) such as French, Welsh, and some dialects of Arabic and Berber.

The fact that different languages can be seen to be in different stages of the process, and that sometimes, as Jespersen says, the whole process can begin again after renewal, prompted Dahl to name the process "Jespersen's '''cycle'''". The observation was however made earlier, most noticeably by [[Antoine Meillet]], who used the term 'spiral'.

==The process==

There are three stages, labelled I, II and III:

In Stage I, negation is expressed by a single pre-verbal element:

:{{interlinear|lang = fro| c1 = (Old French)
|jeo ne  dis.
|I   NEG say
|'I do not say'}}

In Stage II both a preverbal and a postverbal element are obligatory:
:{{interlinear|lang = fr| c1 = (modern standard French)
|je ne  dis  pas.
|I  NEG say  NEG
|'I do not say'}}

In Stage III the original preverbal element becomes optional or is lost altogether:
:{{interlinear|lang = fr| c1 = (modern colloquial French)
|je dis pas.
|I  say NEG
|'I do not say'}}

==Examples==

[[French language|French]] is well known to use a bipartite negative, e.g. "Je ''ne'' sais ''pas''" = "I don't know", lit. "I not know not". [[Welsh language|Welsh]] has a very similar pattern, "''Ni'' wn i ''ddim'', literally "Not know I nothing". In both languages, the colloquial [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] is at a more advanced stage in the cycle, and the first part (''ne'' or ''ni(d)'') is very frequently omitted. In formal Welsh registers, by contrast, ''ni(d)'' tends to be used without ''ddim''. This is not true of formal registers of modern French, but the use of ''ne'' on its own survives in certain set expressions (e.g. ''n'importe quoi'': "no matter what/anything") and with certain verbs (e.g. "Elle ne cesse de parler": "She doesn't stop talking").

English too passed through Jespersen's cycle early in its history: for example "I didn't see" would  be expressed in [[Old English]] as ''ic ne seah'', then strengthened with the word ''nawiht'' "no thing" as [[Middle English]] "I ne saugh nawiht", finally leading to [[Early Modern English]] "I saw not".&lt;ref&gt;Kastovsky, Dieter. 1991. ''Historical English syntax''. P. 452&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Gelderen, Elly. 2006. ''A history of the English language''. P. 130&lt;/ref&gt; The same development occurred in the other Germanic languages such as German and Dutch, which produced their respective postposed negative particles ''nicht'' and ''niet'', first duplicating and eventually ousting the original preposed negative particle ''ne / ni''.&lt;ref&gt;Jäger, Agnes. History of German negation. P. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; English’s do-support and contraction of “do not” to “don’t” in colloquial speech could be argued as moving English back toward Stage I of Jespersen’s Cycle—“I didn’t see”.

[[Central Atlas Tamazight]], a [[Berber people|Berber]] language spoken principally in Central [[Morocco]], uses a bipartite negative construction (e.g. {{IPA|/&lt;u&gt;ur&lt;/u&gt;iffiɣ &lt;u&gt;ʃa&lt;/u&gt;/}} 'he &lt;u&gt;didn't&lt;/u&gt; go out' — the underlined elements together convey the negative) which apparently was modeled after proximate [[Arabic language|Arabic]] varieties.{{sfn|Lucas|2007}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.pwf.cam.ac.uk/cbl23/ContactRevised170708.pdf |title=Contact-induced grammatical change: towards an explicit account }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(389&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chamic]] languages, spoken in parts of [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Hainan]], may also be undergoing Jespersen's cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/lee1996bipartite.pdf |title=Bipartite negatives in Chamic }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(11.5&amp;nbsp;MB)}}, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian and the various Italian regional languages are also undergoing a similar transformation, where even all three stages can be seen in action at once: The standard language is (still?) generally at stage I, with, e. g., ''Non gliel'ho detto'' (I haven't told him/her). This can become ''Non gliel'ho mica detto'' colloquially (stage II) and also (stage III) ''Gliel'ho mica detto'' (sub-standard) or ''Mica gliel'ho detto'' (colloquial), ''mica'' originally meaning "in the least". In [[Western Lombard]], the archaic ''no l'hoo vist'' (I haven't seen him/it)  has since long become ''l'hoo minga vist'' or ''l'hoo vist no'' with no change in meaning.

'''Sir Hrothgar John Habakkuk''' (13 May 1915 – 3 November 2002) was a British [[Economic history|economic historian]].

==Biography==
Habakkuk was born in [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], [[Vale of Glamorgan]], Wales, the son of Evan and Anne Habakkuk. He was named "Hrothgar" after [[Hroðgar]] in ''[[Beowulf]]'', which his father was reading at the time of his birth. However, he came to be known as John when he started to travel to the United States, and when he was knighted he found it easier to call himself "Sir John" than "Sir Hrothgar".&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;[[F. M. L. Thompson]] [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-john-habakkuk-603942.html Obituary, ''[[The Independent]]'' (11 November 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1413579/Sir-John-Habakkuk.html Obituary, ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' (18 November 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt; His surname was assumed by a relatively recent forebear after the prophet [[Habakkuk]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

He was educated at Barry County School and [[St John's College, Cambridge]] (scholar and Strathcona Student, starred&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; [[first class degree]] in History 1936).&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; (He was not, as sometimes erroneously stated, connected with [[Jesus College, Cambridge]]).&lt;ref name=Landes&gt;[[David Landes]], [http://www.aps-pub.com/proceedings/1491/490111.pdf ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society''] vol. 149, no. 1 (March 2005), pp. 99–101.&lt;/ref&gt; He began to study for a PhD under [[John Clapham (economic historian)|John Clapham]], but his progress was interrupted by the Second World War.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; In 1938, he was elected a [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellow]] of [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], a position he held until 1950. He worked in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] 1939–42 and the [[Board of Trade]] 1942–46, during which period he still found time to carry out research at the [[Public Record Office]] and in the archives of country houses.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; After World War&amp;nbsp;II, he was from 1946 until 1950 Director of Studies and Librarian of the college and [[Lecturer#Academic usage|Lecturer]] in the Faculty of Economics. In 1973, [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke]] elected him to an [[Honorary Fellow]]ship. From 1950 until 1960, he was editor, with [[Michael Postan]], of ''[[The Economic History Review]]''.

In 1950, he moved to [[Oxford]], where he would remain for the rest of his life. At the age of just thirty-five he had been appointed [[Chichele Professor of Economic History]] in the University of Oxford and [[Oxbridge Fellow|Professorial Fellow]] of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]]. He held this appointment until 1967, when he became [[Colleges of the University of Oxford#Heads of Houses|Principal]] of [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]]. He also served as [[Vice-Chancellor]] of Oxford University (1973–77)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/vc/position/previousvice-chancellors/|title=Previous Vice-Chancellors | publisher=University of Oxford, UK|accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pro-Vice-Chancellor]] (1977–84). He retired in 1984 and was Ford Lecturer in the following year.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls]] re-elected him to a fellowship in 1988. He was also President of [[Swansea University|University College, Swansea]] from 1975 until 1984 and an honorary fellow of the college from 1991. He was Visiting Professor at [[Harvard University]] 1954/5 and at [[University of California, Berkeley]] (Ford Research Professor)&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; 1962/3.&lt;ref name=Landes/&gt;

Habakkuk was elected a [[British Academy|Fellow of the British Academy]] in 1965&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/deceased.cfm?type=H British Academy Deceased Fellows] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606091257/http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/deceased.cfm?type=H |date=6 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=Landes/&gt; He was appointed [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1976. In the same year he began a four-year term as President of the [[Royal Historical Society]]. He was awarded the degree of [[Doctor of Letters]] ''honoris causa'' by the Universities of [[University of Wales|Wales]] (1971), [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (1973), [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] (1975), [[University of Kent|Kent]] (1978), and [[University of Ulster|Ulster]] (1988).

He was a member of the Advisory Council on Public Records 1958–70, the [[Social Science Research Council]] 1967–71, the [[National Libraries Committee]] 1968–69, the Administrative Board of the [[International Association of Universities]] 1975–84, and the [[Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts]] 1978–90. He was Chairman of the [[Universities UK|Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals of the Universities of the United Kingdom]] 1976–77, the Advisory Group on London Health Services 1980–81,&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; and the [[District Health Authority#Authorities in Oxford Region|Oxfordshire District Health Authority]] 1981–84. He was president of the [[Royal Historical Society]] (1977–1981),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalhistoricalsociety.org/rhspresidents.doc |title=List of Presidents |publisher=Royal Historical Society |accessdate=20 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716111002/http://www.royalhistoricalsociety.org/rhspresidents.doc |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habakkuk was married to his former student,&lt;ref name=Landes/&gt; Mary Richards (died 2002),&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; in 1948. They had a son and three daughters. He died, from renal failure and [[myelodysplasia]], at the house of one of his daughters, Little Orchard, Scot Lane, [[Chew Stoke]], in [[Somerset]], England, on 3 November 2002.

She has published studies in Venezuela, Spain, the United States and Lithuania in which she supports the hypothesis that the [[Goths]] were not a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] but a [[Balts|Baltic]] people.

== Biography ==
Rosales was born on 9 September 1929 in [[Kaunas]], [[Lithuania]] and lived with her parents, at least partly in [[Paris]], until 1938. Her father, Jonas Statkus, was head of the [[State Security Department of Lithuania]] until he was arrested on 6 July 1940 along with [[Augustinas Povilaitis]], General [[Kazys Skučas]], and several other high officials after the [[1940 Soviet ultimatum to Lithuania|Soviet ultimatum to Lithuania]]. He was sent to [[Butyrka prison]] in [[Moscow]] where it is presumed he died on an unknown date. After the end of the Second World War Rosales moved to France where she learned Latin and French, receiving a degree as a teacher of French. She continued her studies at [[Columbia University]] in New York, where she taught English, Spanish, and German. In 1960 she married Venezuelan engineer Luis Rosales; they raised five children—Luis, Juan, Sarunas, Rimas, and Saulius—in a multi-lingual household, using both Spanish and Lithuanian. Starting in 1983 she held the position of editor-in-chief of the Venezuelan opposition magazine ''Zeta'', in addition to writing for Venezuelan daily paper ''[[El Nuevo País]]'' and the [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]-based ''Dirva''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Godos y Bálticos|last=Rosales|first=Jurate|publisher=Vydunas Youth Foundation|year=2004|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; She holds an honorary doctorate from the [[Lithuanian University of Educational Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://on.lt/rosales2011lietuvoje|title=Sava Lietuva: Rosales viešnagė Lietuvoje|last=Rosales|first=Jūratė|website=on.lt|language=lt|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypothesis on the Goths being Baltic ==
Rosales has published studies in the [[United States|US]], [[Spain]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Lithuania]] supporting the idea that the [[Goths]] were a [[Balts|Baltic]], not [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] people.

Rosales traces her research on the controversial hypothesis back to 17th-century Prussian scholar [[Matthäus Prätorius]] who is thought to have first proposed the idea, which was supported by several Lithuanian historians including [[Simonas Daukantas]] and Česlovas Gedgaudas as well as linguist [[Kazimieras Būga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosales |first=Jurate |title=Los godos (2 Vol.) |language=Spanish |year=1999 |publisher=Ariel |location=Barcelona |isbn= 9788434467170}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most of what is known of the [[Gothic language]] is from the sixth-century [[Codex Argenteus]], the only substantive text in the Gothic language. The surviving Codex is a translation of part of the Bible; it contains the greater part of the four [[Gospel]]s. It was written for a small Gothic population living on the banks of the [[Danube]] surrounded by a much larger Germanic population. Rosales's controversial theory is that this latter fact was not taken into account by the Swedish linguist [[Johan Ihre]] when he determined that in 1769 that this work was in a Germanic language. Rosales states that instead the people for whom it was translated—referred to by Jordanes as the "little Goths", distinguished from the [[Ostrogoths]] and [[Visigoths]]—spoke a mix of Gothic (a [[Baltic languages|Baltic language]], according to Rosales) and an exogenous Germanic language.&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, ''Los godos'' (2008), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rosales, prior to Ihre's work, the non-German inhabitants of northeast Europe were referred to as ''Getas'' or ''Gethes'' in medieval chronicles; she adduces several examples from those gathered by Būga and Rackus, like:
*''Gethas id est Letwanos'', Chronicon polonisilesiacum, around 1278 (Goths, that is, Lithuanians) 
*''Gete dicuntur Lithuani, Prutheni et alias ibidem gentes'', W. Kadlubek, XII century (Goths are called Lithuanians, Prussians and other peoples like them)&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, ''Los godos'' (2008), p. 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rosales maintains that from the middle of the second millennium [[BCE]] and into the first millennium BCE, the territory of the Baltics  was in Central and Eastern Europe, from which Goths (which she identifies as being the same people as these ''Getas''), the largest and most southern tribe, made incursions into Asia, going as far as India. She considers the ''[[Getica]]'' ([[Jordanes]] circa 551 A.D. book on the Goths and self-described as a summary of a now lost work by [[Cassiodorus]]), and the 13th-century ''[[Estoria de España]]'' or ''Primera Crónica General'' of [[Alfonso X of Castile]] (Alfonso ''El Sabio'', "The Wise") to be basically accurate. The island of ''Scandza'', the place of origin of the Gothic people, is usually presumed to be [[Scandinavia]], but Rosales says that the [[Curonian Spit]] (a thin strip of land along the Baltic Sea that joins modern-day Lithuania with the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], now a [[Russia]]n exclave), is more congruent with the description in the ''Primera Crónica General'', based on the Spit's nearness to the lower portion and mouth of the [[Vistula]]. She proposes that the Gulf of ''Codano'' is the [[Gulf of Gdansk]]. According to Rosales, Lithuanian name of the spit, ''(Kuršių) nerija'', means the same as ''Scandza'', "that which submerges".&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, ''Los godos'' (2008), pp. 83–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

She concurs with Gedgaudas's date of 1490 BCE for the departure of the Goths from Scandza.&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, ''Los godos'' (2008), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Asserting that the ''Crónica'' mentions (without naming) the [[Battle of Kadesh]] (between the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians and [[Hittites]] in the 13th Century BCE), she identifies the Egyptian king Uesoso named in the ''Crónica'' with [[Ramesses II]]; the ''Crónica'' recounts the Gothic king Thanauso handing Uesoso a major defeat in battle. Subsequently, Thanauso (king in 1290 BCE) continued eastward, arriving 15 years later in India, where some of his warriors settled and became the [[Parthia]]ns and [[Bactria]]ns; the mythological [[Amazons]], she states, would have been Gothic women.&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, ''Los godos'' (2008), Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the linguistic front, she concurs with Gedgaudas according to which the etymology of ''Goth'' is from the Baltic verb ''gaudo'', "to catch" or "to trap", which could refer to a man who captures a cow/bull or, equally, a slave, so either a rancher or a warrior and further proposes that the German ''Gott'' (English "God") is the same word, owing to the Goths deifying some of their kings after they died; the ''Crónica'' relates, "so good was this Thanauso, king of the Goths, that after his death they counted him among the gods." .&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, ''Los godos'' (2008), p. 302-303; the passage about the proposed etymology from ''gaudo'' is, ''"podría referirse al hombre que atrapa a una res y por lo tanto al ganadero, como al que atrapa a un esclavo, por lo tanto a un guerrero."'' The passage about Thanauso is, ''"tanto fue bueno este Thanauso, rey de los godos, que después de morir entre los dioses le contaron".''&lt;/ref&gt; She proposes that ''[[Scythia]]'' means "place of passage" (a place one passed through) and ''[[Scythian]]'' means "transient" (one who is passing through), related to the Baltic ''aisčiai'' (from the root  ''eiti'', "to go").&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, ''Los godos'' (2008), Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

She suggests that millennia-long continuity of a population in northeastern means that the Balts are one and the same as the first [[Indoeuropean]]s, and that this region was the source of the various migrations that created the Indoeuropean domain.&lt;ref&gt;Jurate Rosales, Los godos, Barcelona: Ariel (2004), p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the base of the finding of names like Sembus and Neuri in inscriptions gathered by [[Julien Sacaze]] in the French area which belonged to the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], Rosales sustains that among the Visigoths there was a contingent of [[Sambians]], whose origin was the North of [[Poland]], and other of [[Neuri]], who had lived in the area embraced by the upper [[Volga]], [[Moscow]] and [[Kiev]], the dialects spoken by them are extincts, althoug the ''dzukas'' dialect, still alive in Lithuania, seems to be the last remain of the [[old Prussian language]] spoken by the sambians. She also believes that Baltic languages significantly influenced the phonetics of Latin in the Iberian Peninsula, attributing to it the arising of the [[palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] and the carachteristic [[diphthong]]s of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]] and [[Galician-Portuguese]] and indicates that some Spanish words and surnames are of Baltic origin.&lt;ref&gt;Jurate Rosales, Los godos; Barcelona: Ariel (2004), pp. 43–69, 187, 271–289&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea has been heavily criticized by other academics such as [[Zigmas Zinkevičius]] as [[pseudohistory]] primarily driven by nationalist, not academic concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jūratė Statkutė de Rosales ir gotų istorija|last=Zinkevičius|first=Zigmas|publisher=Lithuanian Academy of Sciences|year=2011|isbn=|volume=no. 4|location=|pages=472–475 |url=http://www.lmaleidykla.lt/ojs/index.php/lituanistica/article/download/2177/1068}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professors Alvydas Butkus and Stefano M. Lanza make similar criticisms of her methodology, to the point of accusing her of twisting the meaning of sources and using "nonexistent" Lithuanian words.&lt;ref&gt;Alvydas Butkus, dr. Stefano M. Lanza, "Kaip baltai tampa gotais", Voruta Nr.24[738], 2011.12.23 ir Nr.1(739), 2012 01 07; the title appears to be a pun, "How Baltic are the Goths"/"How white are the Goths".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahdi''' is computer [[malware]] that was initially discovered in February 2012 and was reported in July of that year. According to [[Kaspersky Lab]] and [[Seculert]] (an Israeli security firm which discovered the malware), the software has been used for targeted [[cyber spying|cyber espionage]] since December 2011, infecting at least 800 computers in Iran and other [[Middle East]]ern countries. Mahdi is named after files used in the malware and refers to the [[Mahdi|Muslim figure]].&lt;ref name="Wired, Kim Zetter"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/07/mahdi/ Mahdi, the Messiah, Found Infecting Systems in Iran, Israel], July 17, 2012 [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]], Kim Zetter&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1665">'''''Sociedad Metropolitano Histórico de Madrid (MHM)'''''-Historical Metropolitan Society of Madrid in English- is a cultural association from [[Madrid]] (Spain) focused in defending and promoting the History and cultural heritage from the Madrid city urban railways, mainly the subway ([[Metro de Madrid]]) and historical [[trams]] and [[Metro Ligero|light trains]].

This society has its origins as successor of the former ''"Sociedad de Amigos del Metro y los Tranvías Históricos de Madrid"'' (SAMETRAHM) -Society of friends of historical Metro and trams of Madrid in english- , which was refunded as MHM in the year 2016 continuing on its same goals and activities.

MHM carries out numerous activities and initiatives of cultural nature. Of particular note is the project developed on the original hall of the Pacífico metro station&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metropolitanohistorico.es/?p=95&lt;/ref&gt; (designed by the renowned Spanish arquitect [[Antonio Palacios]]), which was approved by the [[Ayuntamiento of Madrid|Madrid City Hall]] district office of [[Retiro (Madrid)|Retiro]] district on October 11, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://zonaretiro.com/urbanismo/vestibulo-original-metro-pacifico&lt;/ref&gt;

This association has also played a prominent role in the struggle and defense of the preservation of the historical [[Cuatro Caminos (Madrid Metro)|Cuatro Caminos subway yard and workshop]], where the association also defends the creation of the future Madrid Metro Museum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metropolitanohistorico.es/?p=50&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohammed ibn al-Tayyib al-Qadiri''' (1712–1773) was a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] historian and author of ''Nashir al-Mathani''.&lt;ref&gt;Dwight Fletcher Reynolds, Kristen Brustad, ''Interpreting the Self: Autobiography in the Arabic Literary Tradition'', Ed. University of California Press, 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-520-22667-8}} p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; This work is a biographical dictionary of 18th-century Morocco, but each year is usually accompanied by a summary of events. In this sense, the form of the book tends toward being both that of a [[biographical dictionary]] and a [[chronicle]]. Mohammed al-Qadiri is the grandson of the genealogist [[Abd as-Salam al-Qadiri]].

Full title of al-Mathani (The Chronicles): ''Nashr al-mathani li-ahl al-qarn al-hadi 'ashr wa al-thani'', Edited by A. Tawfiq and M. Hijji. 4 vols. Rabat, 1977. Partial English translation by N. Cigar. ''Muhammad al-Qadiri's Nashr al-mathani: The Chronicles''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1981.

His extensive [[autobiography]] with some references to himself and family is in ''Iltiqat al-durat (wa-mustafad al-mawaiz wa-al-ibar min akhbar wa-ayan al-mia al-hadiya wa-althaniya ashar)'', ed. Hashim al-Alawi al-Qasimi (Beirut: Manshurat Dar al-Afaq al- Jadida, 1983) 449-92. He also composed a catalogue of books (''Al-Fihrisit''), which is unpublished.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2774">'''Mont Blanc Restaurant''' is a former restaurant in London where leading writers including [[Hilaire Belloc]], [[G. K. Chesterton|GK Chesterton]], [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[John Galsworthy|Galsworthy]] met regularly in the early years of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Foden"&gt;{{cite news| first=Giles | last=Foden | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/01/classics.josephconrad | title=The moral agent | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=1 December 2007 | accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The restaurant was located at 16 Gerrard Street in the [[Soho]] district of central London. It was closed in 1928.&lt;ref name="westminster_plaque"&gt;[http://www.westminster.gov.uk/press-releases/2010-07/literary-great-honoured-with-a-green-plaque/ ''Literary great honoured with a green plaque''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130423210424/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/press-releases/2010-07/literary-great-honoured-with-a-green-plaque/ |date=2013-04-23 }}. City of Westminster, 20 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mont Blanc circle==
Writer, critic and publisher [[Edward Garnett]] held regular Tuesday lunches at the restaurant where he nurtured the talent of many literary figures such as [[D. H. Lawrence|DH Lawrence]], [[John Galsworthy]] and [[Liam O'Flaherty]].&lt;ref name="Foden" /&gt; Chesterton and Belloc met at the restaurant in 1900 and subsequently developed a close friendship, apparently sealed over a bottle of [[Moulin-à-Vent#Beaujolais_Crus|Moulin-a-Vent]].&lt;ref name="westminster_plaque" /&gt; In 1912, through Garnett's 'circle' of friends, [[Richard Curle]] was first introduced to Conrad and became his protégé, literary assistant and close friend.

==Commemorative Plaque==
In July 2010 the [[City of Westminster]] decided to commemorate the restaurant with one of its Commemorative Green Plaques.&lt;ref name="westminster_plaque" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ ''Green Plaques Scheme''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716210428/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |date=2012-07-16 }}.

[[File:Meyerhold reads Chekhov's The Seagull in 1898.jpg|thumb|right|200px|At Pushkino in 1898, [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] prepares for his role as Konstantin in the [[Moscow Art Theatre|MAT]] production of [[Anton Chekhov|Anton Chekhov's]] ''[[The Seagull]]''.]]
The '''Moscow Art Theatre production of ''The Seagull''''' in 1898, directed by [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]], was a crucial milestone for the fledgling theatre company that has been described as "one of the greatest events in the history of Russian theatre and one of the greatest new developments in the [[History of drama|history of world drama]]."&lt;ref&gt;Rudnitsky (1981, 8) and Benedetti (1999, 85).&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first production in [[Moscow]] of [[Anton Chekhov|Anton Chekhov's]] ''[[The Seagull]]'', though the play had been performed with only moderate success in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] two years earlier. Nemirovich, who was a friend of Chekhov's, overcame the writer's refusal to allow the play to appear in Moscow after its earlier lacklustre reception and convinced Stanislavski to direct the play for their innovative and newly founded [[Moscow Art Theatre]] (MAT).&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999, 73) and (1989, 25).&lt;/ref&gt; The production opened on {{OldStyleDate|29 December|1898|17 December}}. The MAT's success was due to the fidelity of its delicate representation of everyday life, its intimate, [[Ensemble cast|ensemble playing]], and the resonance of its mood of despondent uncertainty with the psychological disposition of the Russian intelligentsia of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Braun (1981, 64).&lt;/ref&gt; To commemorate this historic production, which gave the MAT its sense of identity, the company to this day bears the seagull as its [[emblem]].&lt;ref&gt;Braun (1981, 62, 64).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stanislavski's directorial conception==
While visiting his brother's estate near [[Kharkiv]] in August 1898, Stanislavski began work on his production plan (or his directorial "score" as he came to call it) for the play, into which he incorporated his sensory experiences of the Russian countryside there.&lt;ref name="b76"&gt;Benedetti (1999, 76).&lt;/ref&gt; He [[storyboard]]ed key moments of the play with small drawings that gave the actor's spatial and [[Proxemics|proxemic]] relationships.&lt;ref name="b76"/&gt; He also detailed individual rhythms, physical lives and mannerisms for each character:
{{cquote|Sorin's laugh is "startling and unexpected"; Arkadina "habitually folds her arms behind her back when she is angry or excited"; Konstantin is, in general, "tense"; Masha takes snuff; Medvedenko smokes a lot. The production copy sets down every move, every gesture, exact facial expressions in almost cinematic detail.&lt;ref name="b76"/&gt;|20px|20px}}
The score indicates when the actors will "wipe away dribble, blow their noses, smack their lips, wipe away sweat, or clean their teeth and nails with matchsticks."&lt;ref&gt;Worrall (1996, 109).&lt;/ref&gt; This tight control of the ''[[mise en scène]]'' was intended to facilitate the unified expression of the inner action that Stanislavski perceived to be hidden beneath the surface of the play in its [[subtext]].&lt;ref&gt;Braun (1981, 62-63).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]], the [[Theatre director|director]] and [[Theatre practitioner|practitioner]] whom Stanislavski on his death-bed declared to be "my sole heir in the theatre—here or anywhere else", and the actor who played Konstantin in this production, described years later the poetic effect of Stanislavski's treatment of the play:&lt;ref&gt;Rudnitsky (1981, xv) and Braun (1982, 62).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Probably there were individual elements of [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] but that’s not important. The important thing is that it contained the poetic nerve-centre, the hidden poetry of Chekhov’s prose which was there because of Stanislavski’s genius as a director. Up to Stanislavski people had only played the [[Theme (literature)|theme]] in Chekhov and forgot that in his plays the sound of the rain outside the windows, the noise of a falling tub, early morning light through the shutters, mist on the lake were indissolubly linked (as previously only in prose) with people’s actions.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Benedetti (1999, 78).&lt;/ref&gt;|20px|20px}}
Stanislavski's directorial score was published in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999, 79). For an English translation of Stanislavki's score, see Balukhaty (1952).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production process==
[[File:Stanislavski Seagull.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Studio portrait of [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] (right) as Trigorin—"elegantly coiffured, clad in evening dress, mournfully contemplating the middle distance with pencil and notepad, suggests someone more intent on resurrecting the dead seagull in deathless prose than plotting the casual seduction of the ardent female by his side."&lt;ref&gt;Worrall (1996, 107).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As an actor, despite wishing to play Trigorin, Stanislavski initially prepared the role of the doctor Dorn, at Nemirovich's insistence.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999, 80).&lt;/ref&gt; When Chekhov attended rehearsals for the production in September 1898, however, he felt that the performance of Trigorin was weak, which resulted in a re-casting; Stanislavski took over Trigorin and Nemirovich apologised for having kept the role from him.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999, 79-81).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olga Knipper]] (Chekhov's future wife) played Arkadina.&lt;ref&gt;Braun (1982, 62).&lt;/ref&gt;

The production had 80 hours of rehearsal in total, spread over 24 sessions: 9 with Stanislavski and 15 with Nemirovich.&lt;ref name="b85"&gt;Benedetti (1999, 85).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, a considerable length by the standards of the conventional practice of the day, Stanislavski felt it was under-rehearsed and threatened to have his name removed from the posters when Nemirovich refused his demand to postpone its opening by a week.&lt;ref name="b85"/&gt;

==Performance and reception==
The production opened on {{OldStyleDate|29 December|1898|17 December}} with a sense of crisis in the air in the theatre; most of the actors were mildly self-tranquilised with [[Valerian (herb)|Valerian drops]].&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999, 85, 386).&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Chekhov, one audience member described how:
{{cquote|In the first act something special started, if you can so describe a mood of excitement in the audience that seemed to grow and grow. Most people walked through the auditorium and corridors with strange faces, looking as if it were their birthday and, indeed, (dear God I'm not joking) it was perfectly possible to go up to some completely strange woman and say: "What a play? Eh?"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Benedetti (1999, 86).&lt;/ref&gt;|20px|20px}}
Nemirovich described the applause, which came after a prolonged silence, as bursting from the audience like a [[dam]] breaking.&lt;ref name="b86"&gt;Benedetti (1999, 86).&lt;/ref&gt; The production received unanimous praise from the press.&lt;ref name="b86"/&gt;

It was not until {{OldStyleDate|13 May|1899|1 May}} that Chekhov saw the production, in a performance without sets but in make-up and costumes at the Paradiz Theatre.&lt;ref name="b89"&gt;Benedetti (1999, 89).&lt;/ref&gt; He praised the production but was less keen on Stanislavski's own performance; he objected to the "soft, weak-willed tone" in his interpretation (shared by Nemirovich) of Trigorin and entreated Nemirovich to "put some spunk into him or something".&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999, 89-90) and Worrall (1996, 108).&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that the play be published with Stanislavski's score of the production's ''[[mise en scène]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999, 90).&lt;/ref&gt; Chekhov's collaboration with Stanislavski proved crucial to the creative development of both men. Stanislavski's attention to [[Realism (theatre)|psychological realism]] and [[Ensemble cast|ensemble playing]] coaxed the buried subtleties from the play and revived Chekhov's interest in writing for the stage. Chekhov's unwillingness to explain or expand on the script forced Stanislavski to dig [[Subtext|beneath the surface of the text]] in ways that were new in theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Chekhov and the Art Theatre, in Stanislavski's words, were united in a common desire "to achieve artistic simplicity and truth on the stage"; Allen (2001, 11).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maulana]] '''Muhammad Ismail Zabeeh''' (1913–2001 CE) was a writer, [[orator]], historian and journalist involved in the [[Pakistan movement]] ([[Creation of Pakistan]]) in 1947.  He was a leader of [[Majlis-e-Ahrar-ul-Islam]] and a staunch supporter of the two nation theory.

==Family origins==
Zabeeh hailed from a scholarly family of [[Hazara people|Hazara]].  He was born to [[Maulana]] [[Ghulaam Yahya Hazarvi]], at Gawaliar, India, in 1913. His father had moved to India after completing his early education in the [[Abbotabad]] district of Pakistan's [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North West Frontier Province]]. It was the thirst for knowledge that moved his father to India, where he studied under various luminaries of his time. They included two famous students of the eminent Maulana [[Muhammad Qasim Nanotwi]].

==Educational career==
In his early teens, Zabeeh went to the institution headed by his father. At 13 he was studying [[Arabic]] language at the [[Darul Uloom]] of [[Deoband]] when his father recalled him to Jamia Illahiyaat, at [[Kanpur]]. He later went to study [[Jamia Millia]] at [[Delhi]] and studied under Dr. [[Zakir Hussain (politician)|Zakir Hussain]].&lt;ref&gt;His brief biography&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts for the Pakistan Movement==
His sagacity and journalistic talent caught the attention of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] who appointed him as the head of the publicity campaign of the All India Muslim league in the 1946 elections. Due to his effective and persuasive publicity campaign in favour of Muslim League candidates, they won almost all the 67 Muslim seats in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. He also campaigned for the victory of [[Liaquat Ali Khan]], which was acknowledged by the later during his address to a large gathering at Kanpur.

==Journalist career==
His journalistic career started while he was in his teens, and last until his death at the age of 87. In his early teens, he remained associated with 'Bombay punch' (a humorous mag), 'Paishwa' and 'Maulvi' at Delhi, and published the monthly 'Arif'. He reported the 'Kanpur Riots' at the age of 17 in 1930. He also was Publicity Secretary of All India [[Majlis-e-Ahrar-ul-Islam]] in 1938. Upon arrest of its President Ameer-e-Shariyat Maulana [[Syed Ata Ullah Shah Bukhari]], Zabeeh acted as President of All India [[Majlis-e-Ahrar-ul-Islam]] in 1939. In 1941, he started publishing the 'Qaumi Akhbar', an Urdu Language daily, which soon became the leading voice of the uprising against the Britons, in the Muslim struggle for a free homeland. In 1947, he started publishing the Urdu Language daily 'Khursheed' from Karachi, along with Mr. Raees Ahmed. In 1949, he published his first English language daily the 'Voice of Sindh' from Hyderabad. In 1954, he published the Urdu language daily, the 'Anjam', which later evolved to 'Mashriq' in the 1960s and for which he was chief editor.

==As a historian==
Zabeeh had particular interest in the history of the Indian subcontinent and its civilization. This became evident by the well-researched books which in this area.

==Works==
* Quran-e- Kareem ke inqilbai faisley (The revolutionary judgements of the Holy Qur'an)
* Barr-e-sagheer main musalmanon ke urooj-o-zawaal ka aik aaina (A reflection of the rise and fall of the Muslims of subcontinent)

{{Judicial interpretation}}
In the context of [[United States]] [[constitutional interpretation]], '''original meaning''' is the dominant form of the [[law|legal theory]] of [[originalism]] today. It was made popular by Supreme Court Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] and contends that the terms of the [[United States Constitution]] should be interpreted as meaning what they meant when they were ratified, which is to say, it asks the question: "What would a [[reasonable person]] living at the time of ratification have understood these words to mean?"

The theory stands in equal opposition to [[Interpretivism (legal)|interpretivist]] theories such as [[original intent]], and [[Legal realism|legal realist]] theories such as that of the [[living Constitution]].

==Theory==
Original meaning is a [[legal formalism|formalist]] theory, and a logical extension of [[textualism]]. Textualists believe that a statute means whatever the [[Plain meaning rule|plain meaning]] of its words is, as opposed to other potential meanings, such as what those who drafted the law or voted for it ''intended'' it to say. Formalists would point out that it is unnecessary for any member of the legislature to share the intentions of any other member of the legislature, or even to ''have'' a particular intent; what counts is their vote, just as if a voter enters a polling station while [[inebriated]], and indicates a preference for the wrong candidate, their vote will count as a vote for the person they indicated on the ballot paper, not for the candidate for whom they intended to vote before they started drinking. Likewise, even if not a single member of the legislature has read and comprehended the effect of a given bill (a scenario some [[USA Patriot Act#Controversy|critics of the USA PATRIOT Act]] and [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] allege to have actually occurred during the enactment of these statutes), once it becomes law, it is a law no less or more valid than an identically worded law passed when every member of the legislature is of the same mind and understanding regarding its meaning and effect. This being the case, it is the text of the law which governs.

==Practice==
An originalist inquiry into the original ''meaning'' of the Constitution is able to cast a much broader net than an inquiry into the original ''intent''.

Originalists of all stripes cite ''[[The Federalist Papers]]''. It is fairly tenuous to suggest that this represents a good source for the original ''intent'': after all, [[Alexander Hamilton]], who wrote the majority of those essays, was absent for the greater part of the [[Philadelphia Convention]], and [[John Jay]] did not attend it at all. However, [[James Madison]], the principal framer of the Constitution also wrote a substantial amount of ''The Federalist Papers''. Also, to suggest Hamilton and Jay's absence from the convention implies their ignorance as to the Constitution's original meaning is demeaning to those two men and inaccurate. The collected anti-Federalist papers, of course, will be no use at all to a person searching for the original ''intent'' of the framers. However, as evidence of how a reasonable person at the time would have understood the words of the Constitution, ''The Federalist Papers'' and the anti-Federalist essays are evidence of direct relevance.

Likewise, neither [[John Adams]] nor [[Thomas Jefferson]] attended the Convention, and thus two of the most prolific writers of the founding era are necessarily excluded (or, at best, abstracted) from an original-intent inquiry. Because they were reasonable contemporaries of the Framers, their writings are informative to discussions of the text's original meaning.

One of the primary virtues of original meaning over original intent is that the original meaning is a fairly discernible thing, while the original intent is nebulous and uncertain. This is well-illustrated by the use of dictionaries. Contemporaneous dictionaries are of dubious value to an original ''intent'' inquiry, but of high value to an original ''meaning'' inquiry: we can establish what the words the Framers chose ''meant'', but that is not ''necessarily'' conclusive as to what they ''intended'' to say (consider for example, the [[unintended consequences|law of unintended consequences]]).

==Origins==
The theory was arguably pioneered and popularized by Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]; whether Scalia could take credit for inventing it, he remained one of its most forceful and high-profile proponents, although he was also accused of deviating from the method (he himself admitted that "in a crunch I may prove a faint-hearted originalist") (Scalia, ''Originalism: The Lesser Evil'', [http://www.joink.com/homes/users/ninoville/lesserevil.asp#864 57 U. Cin. L. Rev. 849 at 864]).

'''Philatelic investment''' is [[investment]] in collectible [[postage stamp]]s for the purpose of realizing a profit. Philatelic investment was popular during the 1970s but then fell out of favour following a speculative bubble and prices of rare stamps took many years to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tony |last=Levene |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2005/jan/22/alternativeinvestment.pensions |title=Philately won't get you anywhere |publisher=The Guardian |work=Money |date=2005-01-22 |accessdate=2010-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Investing in rare stamps requires a high degree of expertise and can be very risky for the novice. Rare stamps are among the most portable of [[tangible investment]]s, take up little space but require careful storage as condition is one of the most important factors in determining the value of a stamp. Other tangible investments include art, antiques, [[precious metal]]s, rare coins and many others that are all termed [[alternative investment]]s. Interest in stamps as an investment tends to increase when [[traditional investments]] are not doing well, causing investors to seek alternatives. The increasing age of the population in western countries has also been credited with a resurgence in interest in stamps.&lt;ref name=goss&gt;{{cite web|last=Sandler |first=Linda |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&amp;sid=aklLsB4MpiZI&amp;refer=home |title=Bill Gross's British Stamps Outperformed Pimco Fund (Update1) |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/apr/13/stamp-collectors-catalogues-philately-clubs "Last post for stamp collectors?"] Patrick Collinson, ''The Guardian'', 13 April 2013.

A British auctioneer warned: ''"Unless you know what you are doing – and this only comes with many years of experience – it is very difficult to buy sensibly and at the right prices. When you buy on a retail basis, you have to overcome the profit margins the dealer has built into his selling price, plus [[VAT]]. When you sell, you also have to overcome dealing charges, whether you sell to an auction house or a dealer. That would consume an awful lot of value. To overcome that mark-up and sell at a profit would require quite a few years of appreciation."'' &lt;ref name=beach&gt;[http://www.ftadviser.com/InvestmentAdviser/Investments/AssetClass/AlternativeInvestments/Features/article/20100118/308fc0ce-fea4-11de-a148-00144f2af8e8/Highlight-Investing-in-stamps.jsp Colin Such, Warwick &amp; Warwick, quoted in "Highlight: Investing in stamps" by Anthony Beachey, ''Investment Adviser'', 18 January 2010.] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5oAjhl7N6?url=http://www.ftadviser.com/InvestmentAdviser/Investments/AssetClass/AlternativeInvestments/Features/article/20100118/308fc0ce-fea4-11de-a148-00144f2af8e8/Highlight-Investing-in-stamps.jsp |date=12 March 2010 }} [https://www.webcitation.org/5oAjhl7N6?url=http://www.ftadviser.com/InvestmentAdviser/Investments/AssetClass/AlternativeInvestments/Features/article/20100118/308fc0ce-fea4-11de-a148-00144f2af8e8/Highlight-Investing-in-stamps.jsp Archived at WebCite here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before investing==
[[File:Magnifying glass2.jpg|right|thumb|A German 1 Reichsmark stamp. One of the most common and least valuable stamps in the world.]]
A stamp investor should have a good knowledge of:
*[[Categorization|Classification]],
*Condition grading,
*[[philatelic expertisation|Authentication]],
*Handling and storage,
*The stamp market,
*[[Philatelic literature]].
The prospective investor will also benefit from attending stamp clubs, auctions, philatelic shows and having a relationship with a knowledgeable dealer.

Very subtle differences in colour, [[Stamp separation|perforation]], [[overprint]]ing, and the like may be what differentiates a valuable stamp from a common one. The investor not only has to be very knowledgeable of these issues but also know (or at least have a reputable expert available to check) whether alterations have been made to make an inexpensive stamp look like a valuable one, or indeed, whether the stamp itself is simply a counterfeit.

==The value of a stamp==
The value of a stamp is determined by a number of factors including:

== Buying stamps ==
[[File:Embossedgreenshilling1847scott5die2.jpg|right|thumb|A British 1 shilling embossed stamp, typical of the type included in an investment portfolio.]]
There are a number of places where a prospective investor can buy stamps:
*The internet,
*Auctions,
*Stamp dealers,
*A few specialised stamp investment firms,
*From a collector in a private sale.

Stamps purchased for investment are usually old classic stamps in fine condition, such as British Victorian stamps or American stamps from before 1900. These may be thought of as the equivalent of buying a [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue chip]] share. Although future prices may vary, as long as there is a hobby of stamp collecting there is likely to be good demand for these stamps.

Stamps typically included in an investment portfolio will be rare and priced in the thousands of dollars or pounds but they will probably not be the greatest rarities as those unique items are typically sold at public auctions and may reach prices approaching or exceeding $1 million US.

Some collectors and investors also try to anticipate future trends and buy low now, this however, is difficult to get right and may take a long time to pay off. Investors may try to identify a developing country with an expanding middle class who may have the time and money to pursue a hobby like stamp collecting as the developing domestic demand may help to force prices up. Recent examples have been India and China.

Some firms are developing collective or [[mutual fund]]s where money from many investors is pooled and each investor owns shares or units in the fund. The fund then invests the money in stamps.

== Size of the market ==
Unlike stocks and shares, the majority of transactions in the [[philatelic]] or stamp market take place informally, by mail order, or in retail environments, and therefore the size of the market is hard to determine. The market is certainly much smaller than the financial markets but it is not trivial. It has been estimated at £5 Billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/3144943/First-class-returns-for-alternative-investments.html "First class returns for alternative investments"] by John Greenwood in ''The Telegraph'', 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these transactions, however, are likely to be low value items rather than investments. In a 2007 interview, Mike Hall of [[Stanley Gibbons]] estimated that "About $1 billion of rare stamps trade annually in the $10 billion-a-year stamp market."&lt;ref name=goss/&gt; The number of collectors worldwide was estimated at 30 million in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;"Stamp your rare individuality" by Nigel Bolitho in ''Financial Adviser'', Financial Times Publications, 25 March 2004, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Adrian Roose of Stanley Gibbons estimated the figure at 48 million including 18 million in China. It is not known how many of these are serious collectors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5oKfHym6e?url=http://www.ftadviser.com/InvestmentAdviser/Investments/AssetClass/AlternativeInvestments/Features/article/20090330/c01a8e08-19fe-11de-9eed-00144f2af8e8/Alternative-Investments-Stamp-of-approval.jsp "Alternative Investments: Stamp of approval" by Adrian Roose, ''Investment Adviser'', FTAdviser.com, 30 March 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical data ==
While there are long term records of retail stamp prices, the first catalogue being prepared in 1862, there is little objective historical data about the past performance of stamps as investments. No long term indices like the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones]] or [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE Index]] exist, although some figures have been compiled by [[Stanley Gibbons]] and ''Stamp Magazine'' in the UK.

From 2002, Stanley Gibbons compiled a ''SG100 Stamp Index'' based on retail and auction prices for the "top 100 most frequently traded stamps" in the world. The index appears on the [[Bloomberg Terminal]] but was discontinued and given heritage status. In 2004 they also launched an index of 30 rare British stamps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/61rMV3WJM?url=http://www.stanleygibbons.com/stanleygibbons/view/content/sg_invest_gb30 GB30 Rarities Index.] Stanley Gibbons 2011. Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the company launched the ''GB250 Rare Stamp Index'' 'to provide a broad view of the investment market for Great Britain stamps', listing the type of stamps they would recommend for investment purposes. The GB30 and GB250 indices are listed on both the Bloomberg Professional service and Thomson Reuters. According to Stanley Gibbons, rare stamps have averaged an annual compound return of 10 per cent over the past 50 years,&lt;ref&gt;"Back to growth" by Vincent Bevins in ''The Financial Times'' 19 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; however, it is important to remember that this figure has been calculated using [[backtesting]] as stamp price indexes are a recent innovation. In addition, the prices in the indexes are based in part on Stanley Gibbon's own retail price lists and frequently traded but low value stamps have been excluded from the index.

Stamp catalogue prices are not considered reliable as they are nothing more than estimates at the top end and represent a retail selling price at the bottom end of the market. Auction realisations may be more reliable but are difficult to use as the investor has to personally analyse the realisations from many auctions over a long period of time in order to come to any useful conclusions. While most trading in shares is on a recognised stock exchange and takes place transparently in public, that is not the case with stamps where only auction transactions take place in public view.

==Selling stamps==
There are a number of ways to sell stamps, as there are to buy, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
*Auctions may achieve the highest prices but the costs are also high.
*Dealers may be able to act quickly or pay cash but are likely to offer a price at least one third below the normal retail sale price for the stamp as the dealer needs to make a profit on the transaction. Some dealers aim to double their money on every transaction.
*Private sales. Many sales take place between collectors, however, an investor who is not a collector is unlikely to have the personal contacts to secure such a sale.

There is no equivalent of the [[stock exchange]] for stamps.

==Risks and disadvantages==
Investing successfully in stamps requires a high degree of specialised knowledge. This takes time to acquire and there are many pitfalls for the inexperienced investor. Some of the risks and disadvantages are:
*The return is not guaranteed.
*The cost of buying is high compared to most other forms of investment.&lt;ref name=beach/&gt;
*The cost of selling is also relatively high.&lt;ref name=beach/&gt;
*Purchases may be liable to a [[sales tax]], for instance VAT in the European Union,&lt;ref name=beach/&gt; which the buyer may not be able to reclaim.
*Stamps may need to be expertised, for a fee, to ensure that they are what they appear to be.
*As tangible items, stamps may need to be insured and are at risk of physical damage or deterioration.
*The future market for the sale of philatelic items is uncertain. The demand for philatelic items comes principally from collectors, not investors, and the majority of collectors are aged over 50 in western countries. There are relatively few younger collectors in Europe and North America that would be expected to be the buyers of the future,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/9027587/Can-stamp-collecting-deliver-profits.html Can stamp collecting deliver profits?] Emma Wall in telegraph.co.uk, 21 January 2012. Retrieved 30 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; although anecdotal evidence suggest that may not be the case in India, China and other developing countries.
*In the longer term, the future existence of postage stamps may be in doubt as people use electronic communications more and more and send fewer letters. If stamps are no longer sold for postage they may cease to be collected and if they are not collected, the vital collector demand that underpins the investment market may disappear.
*Stamps have little intrinsic value, they do not have the raw material value of a gold coin, they do not represent a share in a business like equities, and they usually lack the enduring visual appeal of a great work of art.
*Stamp investment is relatively unregulated compared with, for instance, investments in a [[mutual fund]] and investors may have little protection if things go wrong.
*The size of the philatelic market is small compared to the value of the stock market and vulnerable to aggressive buying by speculators which may distort prices. This happened in the 1970s when a speculative bubble was followed by a collapse in prices.&lt;ref name=robin/&gt;
*Stamps do not generate any interest or dividends.
*It may be impossible to determine the current market value of the stamps without selling them.
*Stamps packaged as "investment portfolios" may be charged at prices higher than their normal market value.
*There is very little reliable and independent historical information about the performance of stamps as investments.
*A long term view is necessary. A quick purchase and sale is unlikely to be profitable.&lt;ref name=beach/&gt;
*When more traditional investments are doing well, interest in alternative investments like stamps may quickly wane.
*Special instructions will need to be given to spouses or executors in the event of the owner's incapacity or death as they may be unfamiliar with philatelic items.
*Stamps may take time to be sold unlike cash, equities or mutual funds which can usually be realised with minimal delay.

== Advantages ==
*Stamps are not highly [[correlation and dependence|correlated]] with other forms of investment&lt;ref name=prof/&gt; and may therefore represent a valuable diversification within a wider portfolio.
*Stamps are highly portable stores of wealth and are easily transported over national borders.
*An ageing population in western countries means that investors approaching retirement may resume childhood hobbies, thus increasing demand.&lt;ref name=prof&gt;"Investing in the 'hobby of things' " in ''Professional Adviser'', 28 September 2006, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;
*There are millions of enthusiastic stamp collectors around the world creating a global marketplace.&lt;ref name=beach/&gt;
*There is a finite supply of classic stamps.
*Stamps are not a financial asset and so may perform better than cash in times of high inflation.
*As a tangible asset, a stamp cannot go out of business like a company quoted on the stock market.
*Stamps are a relatively confidential investment. Unless bought at a public auction, ownership is private and there is no public register as there is for many investments in [[equities]].
*The investor is able to hold and admire his investment, and enjoy its [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] aspects.
*Many stamps have an interesting historical background.

== Regulation and investor protection ==
Stamps purchased for investment do not normally have any special regulatory protection for the purchaser. In the United Kingdom there is no regulation of this area at all from the [[Financial Conduct Authority]].&lt;ref name=levene/&gt; Rules elsewhere may vary. Where investment is collective through a mutual fund there may be some regulation of the activities of the fund depending on its location.

== Stamp investment scandals ==
There have been a number of scandals in this area over the years.

In Ireland in the 1950s, Paul Singer, a Bratislavian Doctor of Philosophy, ran a [[Ponzi scheme]] under the name ''Shanahan Stamp Auctions''. The scheme collapsed when a mysterious robbery took place at the company's office on 9 May 1959, the eve of a major auction, when more than ₤300,000 worth of stamps went missing. Singer was charged with fraud, but was acquitted and vanished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2010/0125/1224263035175.html |title=Stamp auctioneer's epic fraud case ends in acquittal |publisher=The Irish Times |accessdate=2010-02-25 |date=1962-01-25 |last=Joyce |first=Joe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/shanahan-stamp-auctions-26418801.html |title=Shanahan Stamp Auctions |publisher=Irish Independent |accessdate=2010-02-25 |date=2006-11-19 |last=Egan |first=Rory }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the bursting of a speculative bubble left investors unable to realise their investment at the price they had paid. Prices took decades to recover.&lt;ref name=robin&gt;"Stamps lick the competition" by Mark Robinson in ''Investors Chronicle'', 15 August 2008, pp.40-41. [https://www.webcitation.org/5oAlwCrJ9?url=http://www.david-wilmshurst.co.uk/sgi/080815ic.pdf Archived version at WebCite].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, two Spanish firms [[Afinsa]] and ''Forum Filatelico'' collapsed and left around 350,000 investors with investments worth as little as 10% of the price they had paid.&lt;ref name=levene&gt;{{cite news |first=Tony |last=Levene |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2006/may/13/alternativeinvestment.moneysupplement |title=Will stamp-buyers come unstuck?|work=Money |publisher=The Guardian |date=2006-05-13 |accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hotten |first=Russell |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2938680/Spanish-scandal-hits-350000-investors.html |title=Spanish scandal hits 350,000 investors |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=2006-05-13 |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In November 2017 it was announced that Stanley Gibbons' stamp investment subsidiary in [[Guernsey]] had been placed in [[Administration (law)|administration]]. The company was reported to have £12.6 million of philatelic stock but over £70m of liabilities, made up of £54m of "buy-back" guarantees, £6.5m owed to its parent company, and £11m of sundry liabilities.&lt;ref&gt;"Scheme proves philately won't get you everywhere", David Brown, ''The Times'', 23 November 2017, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mawlana Qiamuddin Khadim'''(1901, Afghanistan - 1979, Kabul) ({{lang-ps|مولنا قیام الدین خادم}}) was a renowned [[Afghan]] scholar, poet, writer, journalist,&lt;ref&gt;[http://184.73.243.18:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/1133/1/azu_acku_pamphlet_ds354_m35_1989_w.pdf Afghan Intellectuals in Exile: Philosophical and Psychological Dimensions by Sayed Bahauddin Majroh]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; public speaker and one of the founding member of the first political party of Afghanistan, [[Weekh Zalmian]] (the vigilant youth).

==The Biographical Dictionary of Ecuador==

Pérez Pimentel is the author of the [[Biographical Dictionary of Ecuador]] (Diccionario biográfico del Ecuador), which consists of about 1,600 biographies of nationals and foreigners who have been an integral part of Ecuador.

==Premio Eugenio Espejo==

The Premio Eugenio Espejo (Eugenio Espejo Prize) is the most coveted prize of the nation of Ecuador. It is awarded every two years in the fields of literature, art, culture, science, and to public or private institutions for their work.

The list of 2005's winners was entered into the Official Registry Nº 175 on December 28, 2005, and the actual ceremony took place in January 2006. Usually the winners are announced by August 9, to commemorate National Culture Day (Día de la Cultura Nacional), and to celebrate the anniversary of the creation of the [[Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana]] (The House of Ecuadorian Culture).

For that year's winners, the president Alfredo Palacio increased the monetary prize of the award from $2000 to $10,000. Besides the award money, the winners received medals and a lifetime stipend.

Pérez Pimentel won the prize in the literature category for his lifetime work as a biographer; [[Theo Constante]] won in the art category; [[Rodrigo Cabezas]] won in the science category; [[Luis Enrique Fierro]] won in the cultural activities category; and an award was given to the [[Academia Ecuatoriana de la Lengua]] (The Ecuadorian Academy of Language) for its history of excellence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniverso.com/2006/01/07/0001/262/77C6FBCA29A84D2A9F672E07C14EECFA.html Gobierno escogió a ganadores del premio Eugenio Espejo], January 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Ruth Wittenberg (née Budinoff) was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York. She attended [[Hunter College]] and [[Barnard College]] and worked as a [[Demography|demographer]] for the [[Bell Telephone Company]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Wittenberg developed a strong connection to the Greenwich Village neighborhood as a college student who idolized Village literary and intellectual figures like [[Crystal Eastman]], [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], [[Floyd Dell]], and [[Mabel Dodge Luhan|Mabel Dodge]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/09/archives/unsinkable-village-preserver-is-honored.html|title=Unsinkable ‘Village’ Preserver Is Honored|last=Asbury|first=Edith Evans|date=1977-05-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
Wittenberg began a lifelong commitment to activism when she became involved in [[Suffragette|suffragist]] and [[women's rights]] movements in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/20/realestate/the-guardian-of-new-york-s-living-heritage.html|title=THE GUARDIAN OF NEW YORK'S LIVING HERITAGE|date=1982-06-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to Greenwich Village, she became concerned about the rapid pace of change in the neighborhood, and joined community efforts to advocate for preservation of buildings and against what she saw as destructive real estate projects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She served as co-chairman of the Save our Square Committee, a coalition of 22 community organizations, which took on powerful real estate developers and institutions like [[Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center|St Vincent's Hospital]] and the [[The New School|New School]] in its efforts to preserve and rehabilitate the [[Washington Square Park]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/11/24/82967094.html?pageNumber=70|title=Landmarks Unit Cuts Up 'Village'|last=Ennis|first=Thomas W.|date=1966-11-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 October 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/10/28/washington-sq-gets-a-new-plan.html|title=WASHINGTON SQ.

In the late 1960s, Wittenberg was involved in an unsuccessful protest against the construction of the [[Elmer Holmes Bobst Library]] at [[New York University]], which she and other local residents considered too large for its site at [[Washington Square Park]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The group of neighborhood activists, including [[Jane Jacobs]] and Verna Small, believed that the tall building would cast a large shadow across the park, obstructing sunlight from large portions of public space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/07/21/archives/approval-given-to-nyu-library-city-planning-commission-in-a-52-vote.html&amp;legacy=true|title=Approval Given To N.Y.U.

E. Cummings|e.e. cummings]], [[Morris Ernst]], [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]], and [[Edward Hopper]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/resources/doc/gayle_transcript.pdf|title=Margot Gayle Oral History|last=Hansen|first=Laura|date=1993-07-23|website=Greenwich Village Society for Historical Preservation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wittenberg served on [[Community boards of Manhattan|Community Board 2]], representing Washington Square Park and Greenwich Village, from 1951 until her death in 1990. She served as chairwoman of its Landmarks Committee and played a major role in the successful movement to acquire a Landmark Historical District designation for much of Greenwich Village. When Wittenberg broke her hip in 1975 and again 1976, Community Board 2 held meetings in her hospital room until she recovered enough to attend board meetings on crutches or in her wheelchair.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During her tenure on Community Board 2, Wittenberg was vocal in challenging development plans that she thought would adversely affect the historic neighborhood. In the late 1970s, she protested architect [[Hugh Hardy|Hugh Hardy's]] proposed replacement design for [[18 West 11th Street]], the town house destroyed in an accidental explosion caused the detonation of a bomb built by members of the [[Weather Underground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/27/archives/taste-in-replacing-the-house-on-11th-st.html|title=Taste in Replacing the House on 11th St.|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|date=1977-04-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, Wittenberg opposed architect [[James Polshek|James Polshek's]] design for a residential building on Avenue of the Americas between Waverly and Washington Place, citing its lack of a cornice and projecting lintels and window sills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/28/nyregion/battle-over-cornices-and-lintels-rages-in-village.html|title=BATTLE OVER CORNICES AND LINTELS RAGES IN 'VILLAGE'|last=Severo|first=Richard|date=1984-08-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also campaigned for tasteful street signage, working to reduce advertising with "flashing lights, open store fronts, shiny plastic materials and logos."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/04/archives/communities-start-to-challenge-gawdy-displays-by-retailers.html|title=Communities Start to Challenge Gawdy Displays By Retailers|last=Horsley|first=Carter B.|date=1979-03-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Ruth married Philip Wittenberg, a copyright lawyer and civil liberties attorney, in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/12/obituaries/philip-wittenberg-92-dies-copyright-lawyer-and-author.html|title=Philip Wittenberg, 92, Dies; Copyright Lawyer and Author|date=1987-04-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the couple bought a three-story brick house at 35 W 10th St in Greenwich Village, where they raised two children, Jonathan and Susanna.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ruth lived there for 65 years before dying of natural causes at the age of 91.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Honors and legacy ==
Ruth Wittenberg Triangle, named in 1990 in her honor, is located in Manhattan at the intersection of Greenwich Avenue, Avenue of the Americas, and Christopher Street, just south of the Jefferson Market Courthouse building that she fought to preserve. It is often the site of temporary public art installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/12/nyregion/neighborhood-report-greenwich-village-five-part-tribute-to-a-local-hero.html|title=NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: GREENWICH VILLAGE; Five-Part Tribute to a Local Hero|last=Allon|first=Janet|date=1998-04-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[High Middle Ages]], the [[Chartres Cathedral]] established the [[cathedral school|cathedral]] '''School of Chartres''', an important center of [[France|French]] scholarship located in [[Paris]]. It developed and reached its apex during the transitional period of the 11th and 12th centuries, at the start of the [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Latin translation movement]]. This period was also right before the spread of [[medieval university|medieval universities]], which eventually superseded cathedral schools and [[monastic school]]s as the most important institutions of higher learning in the [[Latin West#Use with regard to Christianity|Latin West]].&lt;ref name="Principe"&gt;Natural Philosophy at School and University, (Lecture 18), in Lawrence M. Principe (2002) ''History of Science: Antiquity to 1700''. Teaching Company, Course No. 1200&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 11th century, (c. 1020), [[Fulbert of Chartres|Bishop Fulbert]] established Chartres as one of the leading schools in Europe. Although the role of Fulbert himself as a scholar and teacher has been questioned, his administrative ability established the conditions in which the school could flourish.&lt;ref&gt;Loren C. MacKinney, ''Bishop Fulbert and Education at the School of Chartres'', Univ. of Notre Dame Indiana, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Great scholars were attracted to the cathedral school, including [[Bernard of Chartres]], [[Thierry of Chartres]], [[William of Conches]], and the Englishman [[John of Salisbury]]. These men were at the forefront of the intense intellectual rethinking that culminated in what is now known as the [[Renaissance of the 12th century|twelfth-century renaissance]], pioneering the [[scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophy that came to dominate medieval thinking throughout Europe.

As with most monastic and cathedral schools, the school's teaching was based on the traditional seven [[liberal arts]], grouped into the [[trivium]] (study of logic, grammar and rhetoric) and into the [[quadrivium]] (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). There were, however, differences among the schools on the emphasis given to each subject. The Chartres school placed special emphasis on the quadrivium (the mathematical arts) and on [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Principe"/&gt;

Chartres' greatest period was the first half of the twelfth century,&lt;ref name="Principe"/&gt; but it eventually could not support the city's large number of students and its masters lacked the relative autonomy developing around the city's other schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Southern | first = R.

It was gradually eclipsed by the newly emerging [[University of Paris]], particularly by the School of the [[Abbey of St. Victor, Paris|Abbey of St. Victor]] (attended by the '[[School of Saint Victor|Victorines]]').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3410">'''Publius Sempronius Asellio''' (born around 158 BC, died after 91 BC)&lt;ref&gt;Liv. lxxiv. Epit.&lt;/ref&gt; was an early Roman historian and one of the first writers of historiographic work in Latin. He was a military tribune of P. [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus]] at the siege of [[Numantia]] in [[Hispania]] in 134 B.C. Later he joined the circle of writers centred on Scipio Aemilianus. Asellio wrote the history of the events of which he was engaged in,&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]], ''Noctes Atticae'' 2.13.3 .&lt;/ref&gt; and thus preceded [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] in his more famous accounts of his military campaigns.

==Life==
Asellio, whose background is unknown, probably belonged to the prestigious plebeian gens [[Sempronia (gens)|Sempronia]]. He was greatly influenced by his co-writer [[Polybius]], who was supported by Scipio Aemilianus. Polybius attempted not only to record events as they took place, but also to look for the causes that led to them. Asellio was the first Roman historian to follow this method&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W., ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology''. Digitized copy in [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0393.html Ancient Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405232034/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0393.html |date=2007-04-05 }}. Retrieved 14 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, he showed contempt for the previous Roman historians of the annalistic school. According to him, they wrote nothing else than a diary as far as form was concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Asellio cited by Gellius 5.18.7-9 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Gentili, Giovanni Cerri, ''La letteratura di Roma arcaica e l'ellenismo''. Con la collaborazione di Salvatore Monda. Biblioteca Aragno. Torino: Nino Aragno Editore, 2005. Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Sempronius Asellio composed the ''Rerum Gestarum Libri'' (sometimes cited as ''Historiae'' or ''libri rerum gestarum'') in at least fourteen books, where he dealt mostly with the events of the [[Third Punic War]] (149-146 BC) onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Crutwell, Charles Thomas (M.A.) ''A History of Roman Literature: From the Earliest Period to the Death of Marcus Aurelius''  (1877) Book I Chapter IX&lt;/ref&gt; But it is also possible he only started recording history after Polybius stopped at 146 B.C. The last reported events in Asellio's work date from the year 91 BC or even 83 BC.

[[Cicero]] did not think highly of Asellio's work and spoke slightingly of its simple style. Nothing apart from 15 citations preserved in later authors ([[Aulus Gellius]] and some grammarians) survives of his work.

[[File:Boeing B-29 Superfortress Bockscar 3 USAF.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|''[[Bockscar]]'', a Silverplate [[B-29 Superfortress]] of the 509th Composite Group, [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki]] ]]

'''Silverplate''' was the code reference for the [[United States Army Air Forces]]' participation in the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]].  Originally the name for the aircraft modification project which enabled a [[B-29 Superfortress]] [[bomber]] to drop an atomic weapon, "Silverplate" eventually came to identify the training and operational aspects of the program as well. The original directive for the project had as its subject line "Silver Plated Project" but continued usage of the term shortened it to "Silverplate".

Testing began with scale models at the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division|Naval Proving Ground]] in [[Dahlgren, Virginia]], in August 1943. Modifications began on a prototype Silverplate B-29 known as the "Pullman" in November 1943, and it was used for bomb flight testing at [[Muroc Army Air Field]] in [[California]] commencing in March 1944. The testing resulted in further modifications to both the bombs and the aircraft.

Seventeen production Silverplate aircraft were ordered in August 1944 to allow the [[509th Composite Group]] to train with the type of aircraft they would have to fly in combat, and for the [[216th Army Air Forces Base Unit]] to test bomb configurations. These were followed by 28 more aircraft that were ordered in February 1945 for operational use by the 509th Composite Group. This batch included the aircraft which were used in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in August 1945. Including the Pullman B-29, 46 Silverplate B-29s were produced during and after World War II. An additional 19 Silverplate B-29s were ordered in July 1945, which were delivered between the end of the war and the end of 1947. Thus, 65 Silverplate B-29s were made.

The use of the Silverplate codename was discontinued after the war, but modifications continued under a new codename, Saddletree. Another 80 aircraft were modified under this program. The last group of B-29s was modified in 1953, but never saw further service.

==Origin==
The Silverplate project was initiated in June 1943 when Dr. [[Norman F. Ramsey]] from the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]]'s  E-7 Group identified the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] as the only airplane in the United States inventory capable of carrying either type of the proposed weapons shapes: the tubular shape of the [[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]], or the oval shape of the [[Fat Man]].{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=6}}

Prior to the decision to use the B-29, serious consideration was given to using the British [[Avro Lancaster]] with its cavernous {{convert|33|ft|adj=on}} bomb bay to deliver the weapon. It would have required much less modification, but would have required additional crew training for the USAAF crews. [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie R. Groves Jr.]], the director of the [[Manhattan Project]], and [[General (United States)|General]] [[Henry H. Arnold]], the Chief of [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF), wished to use an American plane, if this was at all possible.{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=254–255}}

The first B-29 was delivered to the USAAF on 1 July 1943,{{sfn|Bowen|1959|pp=91–92}} and Groves met with Arnold later that month. Groves briefed Arnold on the Manhattan Project, and asked for his help in testing the [[ballistics]] of the Project's proposed bomb shapes. Arnold and the head of the Ordnance Division at Los Alamos, [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[William S. Parsons]], arranged for tests to be carried out at the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division|Naval Proving Ground]] in [[Dahlgren, Virginia]], in August 1943. No aircraft was available that could carry the {{convert|17|ft|adj=on}} long Thin Man, so a {{convert|9|ft|adj=on}} scale model was used. The results were disappointing – the bomb fell in a flat spin – but the need for a thorough test program was demonstrated.{{sfn|Bowen|1959|pp=91–92}}{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=380}}

Groves met with Arnold again in September 1943. He informed Arnold that there was now a second bomb shape under consideration, the Fat Man, and formally requested that further tests be carried out, that not more than three B-29s be modified to carry the weapons, and that the USAAF form and train a special unit to deliver the bombs. Arnold delegated responsibility for this to Major General [[Oliver P. Echols]]. In turn, Echols designated [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Roscoe C. Wilson]] as the Project Officer.{{sfn|Bowen|1959|pp=92–94}}

==Codename==
Originally the name for the aircraft modification project for the B-29 to enable it to drop a [[nuclear weapon]], Silverplate eventually came to identify the training and operational aspects of the program as well. The airplane modification project fell under the purview of the Manhattan Project's [[Project Alberta]] after March 1945.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=7}} The original codename for the project was "Silver Plated" but continued usage of the term shortened it to the one word "Silverplate". For security reasons, the codename "Silverplate" was not officially registered. Confusion then resulted when the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] allocated "Silverplate" to another project. Arnold's office had to order the other agency to discontinue its use of the codename.{{sfn|Bowen|1959|p=96}}

Los Alamos's Thin Man and Fat Man code names were adopted by the USAAF for the weapons. A cover story was devised that Silverplate was about modifying a [[Pullman car]] for use by President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] (Thin Man) and United Kingdom Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] (Fat Man) on a secret tour of the United States.{{sfn|Bowen|1959|p=96}}

==Initial experiments==
[[File:Thin Man plutonium gun bomb casings.jpg|right|thumb|"[[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]]" plutonium gun test casings at [[Wendover Army Air Field]]. Casing designs for "[[Fat Man]]" bombs are seen in the background. The [[tow truck]] was used to lower bombs into a pit for loading into the aircraft.]]

The USAAF sent instructions to its [[Air Materiel Command|Army Air Forces Materiel Command]] at [[Wright Field]], [[Ohio]], on 30 November 1943, for a highly classified B-29 modification project.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=6}} The Manhattan Project would deliver full-sized mockups of the weapons shapes to Wright Field by mid-December, where Army Air Forces Materiel Command would modify an aircraft and deliver it for use in bomb flight testing at [[Muroc Army Air Field]] in [[California]]. B-29-5-BW 42-6259 (referred to as the "Pullman airplane" from an internal code name assigned it by the Engineering Division of Army Air Forces Materiel Command) was delivered to the [[468th Bombardment Group]] at [[Smoky Hill AAB]], [[Kansas]], on 30 November 1943, and flown to Wright Field on 2 December.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=8}}

Modifications to the bomb bays of 42-6259 were extensive and time-consuming. Its four {{convert|12|ft|adj=on}} bomb bay doors and the fuselage section between the bays were removed and a single {{convert|33|ft|adj=on}} bomb bay configured. The length of the initial gun-type bomb shape was approximately {{convert|17|ft}}, necessitating that it be carried in the aft bomb bay, with some of its length protruding into the forward bay. The implosion-type bomb was mounted in the forward bay.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=8}} New bomb suspensions and bracing were attached for both shape types, and separate twin-release mechanisms were mounted in each bay, using modified glider tow-cable attach-and-release mechanisms.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=9}}

==Testing of bomb shapes==
The Pullman B-29 flew into Muroc on 20 February 1944, and testing began on 28 February. Twenty-four drops were carried out before tests were discontinued so that improvements could be made to Thin Man.{{sfn|Bowen|1959|p=91}} The bombs failed to release immediately, frustrating [[calibration]] tests. In what turned out to be the last test flight of the series on 16 March, a Thin Man was prematurely released while the B-29 was still en route to the test range and fell onto the bomb bay doors, severely damaging the aircraft.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=76–77}}  The modified glider mechanisms had apparently caused all four malfunctions, because of the weight of the bombs, and were replaced with British Type G single-point attachments and Type F releases used on the [[Avro Lancaster#Variants|Lancaster B.I Special]] to carry the {{convert|12000|lb|adj=on}} [[Tallboy bomb]].{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=8–10}}

[[File:Fat Man test unit being raised from the pit into the bomb bay of a B-29.jpg|thumb|left|Fat Man test unit being raised from the pit into the bomb bay of a B-29 for bombing practice during the weeks before the attack on Nagasaki]]

After repair of the Pullman B-29 at Wright Field, testing resumed with three Thin Man and nine Fat Man shapes dropped in the last two weeks of June 1944.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=8–10}} High speed photographs revealed that the tail fins folded under the pressure, resulting in an erratic descent. Various combinations of stabilizer boxes and fins were tested on the Fat Man shape to eliminate its persistent wobble until an arrangement dubbed a "California Parachute", a cubical tail box with eight fins within the sheetmetal box "frame", 45° apart from each other (four "[[Orthogonality|orthogonal]]" fins, and four more, one at each 45º angle to each corner) to the line of fall was approved.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=380–383}}

The Thin Man gun-type design was at that time based on the fissibility of the very pure [[plutonium-239]] isotope so far only produced in microgram quantities by the Berkeley cyclotron. When the [[Hanford Site|Hanford]] production reactors came on-line in early 1944, the mix of plutonium-239 and [[plutonium-240]] obtained was found to have a high rate of spontaneous fission. To avoid pre-detonation, the [[muzzle velocity]] of the gun-type design would need to be greatly raised, making it impractically long.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=242–244}}

Thin Man as a plutonium-based design was therefore abandoned and the weapon was re-designed to use [[uranium-235]]. The muzzle velocity required was much lower,{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=249–250}}  reducing the barrel length of the resulting bomb, now code-named [[Little Boy]], to less than {{convert|10|ft}}. This allowed the device to fit into a standard B-29 bomb bay, so the Pullman was modified to its original configuration with the rear bomb bay of a standard B-29 design.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=10, 77–78}} All subsequent Silverplates were also configured in this manner. The Pullman B-29 was flown to [[Wendover Army Air Field]] in [[Utah]] in September 1944. It carried out further drop testing with the [[216th Army Air Forces Base Unit]] until it was damaged in a landing accident in December.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=161}}

==Wartime production versions==

On 22 August 1944, to meet the requirements of the USAAF group about to be formed to train in the atomic mission, a production phase of Silverplate B-29s was ordered from the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]]'s modification center at [[Omaha, Nebraska]], under the designation Project 98146-S.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=12}} The first three of these second increment Silverplate B-29s were delivered to the USAAF in mid-October, and flown to Wendover. They were fitted with British single-point bomb releases mounted on a re-designed H-frame suspension rack fitted in the forward bomb bay, so that additional fuel tanks could be carried in the aft bay. A new crew position, called the "weaponeer station", was created in the cockpit with a panel to monitor the release and detonation of the bomb during the actual combat drops.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=13–16}} Fourteen production aircraft were assigned to the [[393d Bombardment Squadron]] for training, and three to the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit for bomb drop testing.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=12}}

By February 1945 the seventeen aircraft of the second increment were themselves in need of upgrades, particularly those of the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit. Four of the planes assigned to the 393d Bombardment Squadron (now part of the [[509th Composite Group]]) were transferred to the 216th to meet an increase in its testing tempo. Rather than attempt to modify the existing aircraft a few at a time, a decision was made to start a new production series. The first five of this third increment, known as Project 98228-S, also went to the test unit. The order totaled an additional 28 aircraft, with delivery of 15 designated combat models for the 393d beginning in April.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=13–16}} The final eight were not delivered until after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|two atomic bomb missions]] in August. Two were given to the 216th while the remaining six were assigned to the 509th at Wendover as replacements for any bombers lost while operating from [[Tinian]]. Ironically, no bombers were lost during operations from Tinian, but five of these six were lost in crashes over the next few years.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=21}}

[[File:Little Boy being raised for loading into the Enola Gay's bomb bay.jpg|thumb|left|Little Boy being raised for loading into the ''[[Enola Gay]]''{{'}}s bomb bay]]
The final wartime Silverplates incorporated all technical improvements to B-29 aircraft, as well as the final series of Silverplate modifications that included Curtiss Electric [[Reverse thrust|reversible-pitch]] [[propeller]]s, and pneumatic actuators for rapid opening and closing of bomb bay doors. The British F-type bomb release and G-type attachment were installed, along with dual electrical and mechanical bomb release mechanisms.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=13–16}} Early model B-29s were plagued by a host of engine problems, and the early Silverplate bombers were no exception.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=14, 103}} One was written off after being badly damaged as a result of an engine fire in February 1945.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=47}} The [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[Wright R-3350-41]] engines in the later model bombers delivered in July and August 1945 were greatly improved and far more reliable. This was an important factor in the success of the 509th Composite Group's operations.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=14, 103}}

The Fat Man and [[Pumpkin bomb]]s (non-nuclear bombs that resembled and handled like Fat Man) weighed over {{convert|10000|lb}}, so weight was a concern, even with the more powerful engines.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=72, 88}} Weight reduction was accomplished by removal of all [[Turret#Aircraft|gun turret]]s and [[armor plating]]. This work was done by the 509th Composite Group for the early Silverplate aircraft, but later models were delivered without them. These B-29s represented a significant increase in performance over the standard variants.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=13–16}}

Flying at {{convert|30000|ft}} put the B-29s above the effective range of Japanese [[flak]].{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=175}} Each Pumpkin bomb mission was conducted by a formation of three aircraft in the hope of convincing the Japanese military that small groups of B-29s did not justify a strong response. This strategy proved successful, and Japanese fighters only occasionally attempted to intercept the 509th Composite Group's aircraft.{{sfn|Polmar|2004|pp=24–25}} One B-29 incurred minor battle damage in operations.{{sfn| History of 509th Composite Group|1945|pp=58–62}}

==Silverplate operational units==
Including the Pullman B-29, a total of 46 Silverplate B-29s were produced during World War II. Of these, 29 were assigned to the 509th Composite Group during World War II, with 15 used to carry out the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. An additional 19 Silverplate B-29s were ordered in July 1945, which were delivered between the end of the war, and the end of 1947. By this time only 13 of the original 46 were still operational. Thus, a total of 65 Silverplate B-29s were made, of which 32 were operational at the start of 1948.{{sfn|Little|1955|pp=391–392}} Martin-Omaha produced 57 Silverplate B-29s. The other 8 were built by Boeing-Wichita. Of these 65 bombers, 31 were eventually converted to other configurations, 16 were placed in storage and later scrapped, and 12 were lost in accidents (including four of the Tinian bombers). The pair of historic weapons delivery aircraft, named ''[[Enola Gay]]'' and ''[[Bockscar]]'', are today displayed in museums.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=159}}&lt;ref name="Restoration"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/museum/garber/enola/enola.htm |title=Boeing B-29 'Superfortress': Enola Gay. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120101331/http://www.nasm.si.edu/museum/garber/enola/enola.htm |archivedate=20 January 2012 |publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum]] |accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3358 |title=Bockscar: The aircraft that ended WWII |publisher=United States Air Force |accessdate=29 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323230514/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3358 |archivedate=23 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only other [[United States Air Force]] combat unit to use the Silverplate B-29 was the [[97th Bombardment Wing]] at [[Biggs Air Force Base]] in [[El Paso, Texas]]. In mid-1949 it received 27 of the aircraft from the [[509th Bombardment Wing]] when the latter transitioned to [[B-50 Superfortress|B-50D]] bombers.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=63}} The re-equipment of the 97th Bombardment Wing was part of an expansion of the atomic strike force to ten wings during 1949.{{sfn|Little|1955a|pp=113–114}} Within a year all were converted to TB-29 trainers. One other Silverplate B-29, on temporary assignment in the United Kingdom, was converted into a weather reconnaissance aircraft (WB-29) and transferred to the [[9th Reconnaissance Wing|9th Bombardment Wing]] at [[Travis Air Force Base]] in California.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=63}} The last Silverplate B-29 in service as a nuclear weapons carrier was reassigned to another role in November 1951, ending Silverplate after nearly eight years.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=103}}

==Follow-up programs==
Use of the codename Silverplate was discontinued in May 1947. It was superseded by a new codename, "Saddletree", which was applied to aircraft modifications only. Initially it was intended that Saddletree would refer only to modifications to the B-29s, but it came to be used for modifications to B-50 and [[B-36]] bombers as well.{{sfn|Little|1955|pp=391–392}} Saddletree modifications included a new bomb bay frame and hoist, and replacing the British FG bomb release with the newly developed U-1 pneumatic bomb release mechanism. Due to delays in the delivery of the B-50s, Saddletree commenced in February  1948. In all, 6,000 hours of work was carried out on each of the 36 B-50s by Sacramento Air Materiel Area.{{sfn|Little|1955|pp=393–394}}

The [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] issued a directive in January 1948 for the modification of 225 B-29, B-50, and B-36 bombers to carry nuclear weapons, along with eight [[C-97 Stratofreighter]] aircraft to carry bomb assembly teams. There were already 32 Silverplate B-29s in service with the [[Strategic Air Command]], so the Air Materiel Command was directed to carry out Saddletree modifications on a further 80 B-29s, 36 B-50As, 23 B-50Bs and 18 B-36Bs. The B-36A could not carry nuclear weapons without major modifications.{{sfn|Little|1955|pp=393–394}}

As the anticipated enemy was the [[Soviet Union]], the aircraft also required "winterization" to allow them to operate from [[Arctic]] bases. The project included 36 B-29s, and the modification of 36 others to have an [[air refueling]] capability. With the addition of the 80 Saddletree B-29s, a total of 145 B-29s were modified to carry nuclear weapons, and 117 of these were assigned to operational units.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=23–24}}

In October 1951, in anticipation of a major build-up of the USAF to 95 groups, and of delays in the [[B-47]] program, the Air Materiel Command was ordered to modify a further 180 B-29s then in storage to carry the [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb|Mark 4]], [[Mark 5 nuclear bomb|Mark 5]], [[Mark 6 nuclear bomb|Mark 6]], and [[Mark 8 nuclear bomb]]s. Modifications were carried out in Oklahoma City and Sacramento. By the time the aircraft were all delivered in September 1953, the B-29 was being phased out, and the modified aircraft went back into storage without seeing further service.{{sfn|Ailing|1959|pp=32–34}}

==Costs==
In 1945, a B-29 bomber cost $782,000. It cost $32,000 to upgrade an aircraft to Silverplate configuration, so the total cost of a Silverplate bomber was $814,000. The total cost of the 65 wartime Silverplate B-29s was therefore $53 million. Adding $7 million for logistics, this put the estimated cost of the Silverplate project at around $60 million.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=107, 221}}

'''''The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution''''' (1970) is a book by the [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] [[Shulamith Firestone]]. Written over a few months when Firestone was 25, it has been described as a classic of feminist thought.{{sfn|Faludi|2013}}{{sfn|Warren|1980|pp=155–157}}

Firestone argues that the "sexual class system"{{sfn|Firestone|1970|p=29}} predates and runs deeper than any other form of oppression, and that the eradication of [[sexism]] will require a radical reordering of society: "The first women are fleeing the massacre, and, shaking and tottering, are beginning to find each other.&amp;nbsp;... This is painful: no matter how many levels of consciousness one reaches, the problem always goes deeper. It is everywhere.&amp;nbsp;... feminists have to question, not just all of ''Western'' culture, but the organization of culture itself, and further, even the very organization of nature."{{sfn|Firestone|1970|pp=3–4}}

The goal of the feminist revolution, she wrote, must be "not just the elimination of male privilege but of the sex distinction itself" so that genital differences no longer have cultural significance.{{sfn|Firestone|1970|p=11}}

==Summary==
{{Cleanup section|reason=description of the book should be based on the book itself, not a secondary discussion of it|date=January 2018}}
Firestone's theories have been described by philosophy professor [[Mary Anne Warren]] as follows: Firestone argues that the biological sexual dichotomy, particularly the biological division of labor in reproduction, is the root cause of male domination, economic class exploitation, [[racism]], [[imperialism]] and ecological irresponsibility. Sexual inequality is "an oppression that goes back beyond recorded history to the animal kingdom itself": in this sense, it has been universal and inevitable, but the cultural and technological preconditions now exist that make its elimination possible and perhaps necessary for human survival.{{sfn|Warren|1980|pp=155–157}}

Firestone describes her approach as a [[dialectical materialism]] more radical than that of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]. She believes that in their preoccupation with economic processes, Marx and Engels failed to perceive "the sexual substratum of the historical dialectic." Unlike Engels, she maintains that male domination is biologically based and as such existed long before the institution of private property and the monogamous patriarchal family which private property produced. Male domination is the result of the "biological family", whether matrilineal or patrilineal, and the inevitable dependence of women and children within the family upon men, for protection if not subsistence. There were no ancient matriarchies (societies ruled by women), and the apparently superior status of women in matrilineal cultures is due only to the relative weakness of men. Whatever the lineage system, women's vulnerability during pregnancy and the long period of human infancy necessitate the protective and hence dominant role of the male.{{sfn|Warren|1980|pp=155–157}}

This dependence of the female and the child on the male causes "psychosexual distortions in the human personality", distortions that were described by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Firestone describes Freudianism as a "misguided feminism", since she sees the only real difference between Freud's analysis and that of the radical feminists as being that Freud and his followers accept the social context in which sexual repression develops as immutable. Freud demonstrated that the source of repression and sex-class distinctions is the inherently unequal power relationship in the biological family: women and children are alike oppressed by the more powerful father. The young boy identifies first with the mother, whose oppression he shares, but soon switches his identification to the father, whose power he fears but will someday inherit. In the process he accedes to the [[incest taboo]] and the strict separation of sexuality and emotion which this requires, and which is the psychological foundation of political and ideological oppression. While the young girl also envies the father's power, she learns that she cannot inherit it and can only share in it indirectly, by currying favor with the dominant male.{{sfn|Warren|1980|pp=155–157}}

Not only are women and children both inevitably oppressed in the biological family, they are doubly oppressed by the particular form of it which prevails in the industrialized nations: the patriarchal nuclear family, which isolates each couple and their offspring. Compulsory schooling and the romantic mythology of childhood are devices which serve to prolong the isolation of children and their economic dependence. The socialist-feminist revolution will free both women and children, leaving them with complete economic independence and sexual freedom, and integrating them fully into the larger world. The end of the sex-class system must mean the end of the biological family, that is, the end of women's biological reproductive role through artificial means of gestation. Love between the sexes will remain, for it becomes oppressive only when joined to the reproductive function. The biological family turns sexual love into a tool of oppression. Within it, women give their love to men, thus inspiring the latter to greater cultural creativity, and providing the former with an emotional identity of the sort denied them in the larger world. Yet men, as a result of the [[Oedipus complex]] and the incest taboo, are unable to love: they must degrade the women they make love to, in order to distinguish them from the mother, the first and forbidden love object. They cannot simultaneously respect and be sexually attracted to women.{{sfn|Warren|1980|pp=155–157}}

This is why the "sexual revolution" has not meant liberation for women, who are still bound by the double standard and the need to combine love and sexuality. By eliminating the biological family and the incest taboo, the feminist revolution will enlarge the opportunity for real heterosexual love, as well as legitimating every other type of voluntary sexual relationship. Firestone hesitates to make exact predictions about how children will be raised once they are no longer born of women in the biological family, but suggests that there will be a variety of child-rearing social units, including couples "living together" and households of unrelated persons, up to a dozen or so, who contract to remain together long enough to provide a home for their children until the latter are ready to enter the world, which they will do at a much earlier age than is now considered possible.{{sfn|Warren|1980|pp=155–157}}

The feminist revolution presupposes [[socialism]], but goes beyond it. Existing socialist societies have tried to expand women's roles without fundamentally altering them, to integrate women into a male world, rather than eliminating sex class altogether. The feminist revolution will end the split between the "Aesthetic Mode" (feminine, intuitive, and artistic) and the "Technological Mode" (masculine, empirical, and aimed at the control of nature through the comprehension of its mechanical laws). The end of sexual repression will free Eros to diffuse throughout and humanize the entire culture. Eventually it will lead not only to the end of alienated labor but of labor as such, defined as activity which is not performed for its own sake. Technology will eliminate domestic and other drudgery, leaving everyone free to do work which is intrinsically rewarding.{{sfn|Warren|1980|pp=155–157}}

==Reception==
''The Dialectic of Sex'' is a [[feminism|feminist]] classic. Warren described it in 1980 as "the clearest and boldest presentation thus far of the radical feminist position".{{sfn|Warren|1980|p=155}} In 1998 [[Arthur Marwick]] ranked it as one of radical feminism's two key texts, along with [[Kate Millett]]'s ''[[Sexual Politics]]'' (1969).{{sfn|Marwick|1998|p=687}} Writing in ''[[The Cambridge Companion to Marx]]'' (1991), Jeff Hearn described Firestone's approach as having lasting significance in reviving interest in sexuality and reproduction as the basis of [[patriarchy]].{{sfn|Hearn|1999|p=241}}

The American journalist [[Susan Faludi]] wrote in 2013 that, although criticized for their radicalism, the basic tenets of ''The Dialectic of Sex'' have been of lasting significance. Firestone imagined reproduction outside the womb, and children being raised by collectives and granted the right to leave abusive situations. "Predictably," Faludi wrote, "the proposal[s] stimulated more outrage than fresh thought, though many of Firestone's ideas—children's rights, an end to 'male' work and traditional marriage, and social relations altered through a 'cybernetic' computer revolution—have proved prescient."{{sfn|Faludi|2013}}

[[Juliet Mitchell]] argued that Firestone misreads Freud, and misunderstands the implications of psychoanalytic theory for feminism. She noted that while Firestone, like [[Simone de Beauvoir]], attributes the term "Electra complex" to Freud, it was actually coined by [[Carl Jung]]. Mitchell suggested that for Firestone, the only kind of reality is social actuality (the generic experience or accidental experience of the individual), and that in this respect Firestone's work closely resembles that of [[Wilhelm Reich]]. In Mitchell's view, Firestone's interpretation of Freud reduces his psychological constructs to the social realities from which they were reduced, thereby equating the Oedipus complex with the nuclear family. Firestone thus interprets Freudian "metaphors" such as the Oedipus complex in terms of power relations within the family, an approach Mitchell considered mistaken.{{sfn|Mitchell|2000|pp=346–350}}

In her introduction to the 1998 edition of the book, Rosalind Delmar argued that Firestone's "counter-explanation of problems observed by Freud relies too heavily on recourse to rationalizations", and neglect the inner world of fantasy. In Delmar's view, the result of Firestone's discussion of Freud is that "Freud is not so much refuted or rescued from his mistakes as ignored."{{sfn|Delmar|1979|p=9}} Mary O'Brien, in her ''The Politics of Reproduction'' (1981), criticized Firestone's work for reductionism, biologism, historical inaccuracy, and general crudity.{{sfn|Hearn|1999|p=241}}&lt;!--cite O'Brien directly--&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Evolution of Human Sexuality]]'' (1979), the anthropologist [[Donald Symons]] attributed to Firestone the view that, although the sexes are identical at birth, men are emotionally crippled by early experiences that women escape, and that men, unlike women, are therefore unable to love. Symons contrasted Firestone's views with his own view that "selection has produced marked sex differences in sexuality" and that neither sex is a defective version of the other.{{sfn|Symons|1979|p=4}}

In an interview with Anne-Marie Cusac in ''[[The Progressive]]'', gay rights activist [[Urvashi Vaid]] identified ''The Dialectic of Sex'' as an influence on her work ''[[Virtual Equality]]'' (1995).{{sfn|Cusac|1996|page=34}}

According to Firestone, [[Valerie Solanas]], author of the ''[[SCUM Manifesto]]'', told her that she disliked ''The Dialectic of Sex''.{{sfn|Firestone|1998|pp=130–131}}

==Timeline==

===Prologue===
Prior to the summer protests, there had been growing unease in the population regarding the economic distress of the country which has stagnant economic growth and is ranked among the 20 poorest countries in the world according to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Michael Casey, [http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iofx72HB6-rwZnXsnhgbYbIpkVFQ Monks Put Myanmar Junta in Tight Spot], Associated Press, September 21, 2007.{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many, including the United Nations have blamed the economic problems on the inept leadership of the military junta that spends large amount of money  maintaining one of the world's largest armies (said to total more than half the country's annual budget).&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7023548.stm/ The hardship that sparked Burma's unrest] BBC, 02/10/07&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2006, the cost of basic commodities began rising sharply in Burma with rice, eggs, and cooking oil increasing by 30-40%.  According to the UN, one in three children is chronically malnourished, government spending on health and education is among the lowest anywhere in the world, and the average income is below $300 a year.  Living a privileged, parallel existence, Burma's military forces appear virtually a "state within a state", subject to none of the severe economic insecurity that afflicts the rest of the country. Many of the high ranking army generals have become immensely rich; as witnessed in the video of the wedding of senior general [[Than Shwe]]'s daughter, who is shown wearing diamonds worth many millions of dollars.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7023548.stm The hardship that sparked Burma's unrest] ''BBC News'' October 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6109356.stm Burma leader's lavish lifestyle aired] BBC, 02/11/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the BBC, on February 22, 2007, a small group of individuals protested the current state of consumer prices in the country. While the protest was small and careful not to be seen as directed at the military junta, officials jailed nine of the protesters. it was the first street protest seen in Rangoon for at least a decade.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===August 15 - Removal of fuel subsidies===
On August 15, 2007 the government removed subsidies on fuel causing a rapid and unannounced increase in prices.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The government, which has a monopoly on fuel sales, raised prices of fuel from about $1.40 to $2.80 a gallon, and boosted the price of natural gas by about 500%.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; This increase in fuel prices led to an increase in food prices. Soon afterwards, protesters took to the streets to protest the current conditions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

While the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] had been recommending the lifting of subsidies for some time to allow for a [[free market]] to determine fuel prices,&lt;ref name ="IMF"&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/IH24Ae03.html Fuel price policy explodes in Myanmar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF2"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071008153246/http://www.pinr.com/report.php?ac=view_report&amp;report_id=688&amp;language_id=1 The Economic Factors Behind the Myanmar Protests]&lt;/ref&gt; these organizations did not recommend removing all of the subsidies unannounced.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The fuel is sold by [[Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise]], a [[state monopoly|state-owned]] fuel company.

===Initial demonstrations===
In response to the increase in fuel prices, citizens protested in demonstrations beginning on August 15.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; In response to the protests, the government began arresting and beating demonstrators.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The government arrested 13 prominent Burmese dissidents including [[Min Ko Naing]], [[Ko Ko Gyi]], [[Min Zeya]], [[Ko Jimmy]], [[Pyone Cho]], [[Arnt Bwe Kyaw]] and [[Mya Aye (activist)|Ko Mya Aye]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Glenn Kessler, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/22/AR2007082202488_pf.html U.S. Condemns Burmese Arrests Of 13 Dissidents: Sharp Increases in Prices Spur Protests] Washington Post, August 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The government newspaper New Light of Myanmar reported that these individuals' actions caused civil unrest that "was aimed at undermining peace and security of the State and disrupting the ongoing National Convention.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The United States condemned the arrest of these dissidents on August 22 with the State Department's acting spokesman stating "The United States calls for the immediate release of these activists and for an end of the regime's blatant attempt to intimidate and silence those who are engaged in peaceful promotion of democracy and human rights in Burma...We call on the regime to engage in a meaningful dialogue with the leaders of Burma's democracy movement and ethnic minority groups and to make tangible steps toward a transition to civilian democratic rule."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

On September 5, 2007, Burmese troops forcibly broke up a peaceful demonstration in [[Pakokku]] and injured three monks. The next day, other monks later took government officials as hostages in retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7010202.stm Q&amp;A: Protests in Burma] BBC, September 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They demanded an apology by the deadline of September 17, but the military refused to apologize. This sparked protests involving increasing numbers of monks in conjunction with the withdrawal of religious services for the military. Their role in the protests has been significant due to the reverence paid to them by the civilian population and the military. After these events, protests began spreading across Myanmar, including [[Yangon]] (also known as '''Rangoon'''), [[Sittwe]], [[Pakokku]] and [[Mandalay]].&lt;ref name=MONKS-LEAD-LARGEST-PROTEST&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7009825.stm Monks lead largest Burma protest] BBC, September 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Escalation===
On September 22, around two thousand monks marched through [[Yangon]] and ten thousand through [[Mandalay]], with other demonstrations in five townships across Myanmar. Those marching through the capital were allowed to pass the house of [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel peace laureate]] [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].&lt;ref name="Rangoon"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/09/23/myanmar.protest.ap/index.html 20,000 march in Myanmar protest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012014606/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/09/23/myanmar.protest.ap/index.html |date=2007-10-12 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although still under house arrest, Suu Kyi made a brief public appearance at the gate of her residence to accept the blessings of the Buddhist monks.&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070922/wl_asia_afp/myanmarprotestmonks |title=AFP:Democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi greets Myanmar monks |df= }}{{dead link|date=February 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 150 nuns joined the protests in Yangon. On that day, some 15,000 Buddhist monks and laymen marched through the streets of Yangon in the sixth day of escalating peaceful protests against the Burmese military regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/topstories/topstories.php?id=121953 Monks' protest swells] The Bangkok Post, September 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance of All Burmese Buddhist Monks have vowed to continue the protests until the Burmese military junta is deposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7009005.stm|title=Nuns in Burma anti-junta rallies | work=BBC News | date=September 23, 2007 | accessdate=January 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, eyewitnesses reported between 30,000 and 100,000 people demonstrating in Yangon, making the event the largest Burmese anti-government protest in twenty years.&lt;ref name=MONKS-LEAD-LARGEST-PROTEST /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/09/24/myanmar.protest.ap/index.html 100,000 protest Myanmar junta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725143642/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/09/24/myanmar.protest.ap/index.html |date=2008-07-25 }} CNN, September 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; BBC reported that two locally well-known actors, comedian [[Zargana]] and film star [[Kyaw Thu]], went to Yangon's golden [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] early on Monday to offer food and water to the monks before they started their march. The marches occurred simultaneously in at least 25 cities across Myanmar, with columns of monks stretching up to {{convert|1|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=US-TO-IMPOSE-NEW-SANCTIONS&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7011607.stm US to impose new Burma sanctions] BBC, September 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the march, approximately 1,000 monks arrived to greet [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]'s home but were denied access by police. They chanted prayers before peacefully moving off. Later that day, the military junta's Minister for Religion, [[Brigadier General]] [[Thura Myint Maung]], warned the Buddhist monks leading the protests not to go beyond their "rules and regulations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7010839.stm|title=Burmese military threatens monks | work=BBC News | date=September 24, 2007 | accessdate=January 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[United States|U.S.]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] was expected to introduce further unilateral [[International sanctions|sanctions]] against the Burmese leaders during his speech to the [[UN General Assembly]]. It has been noted that the Bush administration hopes to further embolden the protesters and encourage other countries to follow its lead.&lt;ref name=US-TO-IMPOSE-NEW-SANCTIONS/&gt;The [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] of [[Tibet]] also gave his blessing to the monks in their bid for greater freedom and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/world/view_article.php?article_id=90451 |title=Dalai Lama offers support to Myanmar monks |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007205402/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/world/view_article.php?article_id=90451 |archivedate=2008-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 25, the junta threatened demonstrators with military force and placed army trucks at Shwedagon Pagoda, the assembly point for monks leading the protests. Witnesses said 5,000 monks and laypeople still marched into the Shwedagon. Civilians were forming a [[human shield]] around the monks; Reuters quotes one eyewitness: "They are marching down the streets, with the monks in the middle and ordinary people either side - they are shielding them, forming a human chain.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7013638.stm ''Burmese riot police attack monks''] BBC News, 09/10/07&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicles mounted with loudspeakers toured central Yangon, blaring warnings of military action. "People are not to follow, encourage or take part in these marches. Action will be taken against those who violate this order," the broadcasts said, invoking a law allowing the use of military force to break up illegal protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2007-09-25T063524Z_01_B588599_RTRIDST_0_NEWS-MYANMAR-COL.XML Myanmar junta threatens military force] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217111501/http://ca.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2007-09-25T063524Z_01_B588599_RTRIDST_0_NEWS-MYANMAR-COL.XML |date=2007-12-17 }} Reuters, September 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Reuters reported that the detained democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi had been moved to the [[Insein Prison|Insein prison]] on Sunday, a day after she appeared in front of her house to greet marching monks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/wtMostRead/idUSB58859920070925 Myanmar junta sets curfew] Reuters, September 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective September 26, Myanmar's junta imposed dusk-till-dawn curfews on the country's two largest cities of [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]]. Additionally, gatherings of more than five people were prohibited. Meanwhile, truckloads of armed soldiers and riot police were sent into Yangon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hXKLA7lM0A-IwwffmHhQfZDhT5UA Myanmar imposes curfews after mass protests] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609092458/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hXKLA7lM0A-IwwffmHhQfZDhT5UA |date=2007-06-09 }} AFP, September 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 26 pro-democracy figure Win Naing was arrested at his home in Yangon around 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. after being seen providing food and water to the protesting monks but was released from jail after one night, according to an anonymous friend and [[Western world|Western]] diplomat. Win Naing is in his 70s and had been arrested on March 8 for holding a press conference with Burmese demonstrators against the national economic hardships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gPUjdWUHQY4VeYAGG3zQfGIRAdng|title=Pro-democracy politician arrested in Myanmar|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708060414/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gPUjdWUHQY4VeYAGG3zQfGIRAdng|archivedate=2009-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Burmese comedian Zargana was also arrested overnight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7013638.stm Burma monks march as police act] BBC, September 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Troops barricaded Shwedagon Pagoda and attacked a group of 700 protesters with batons and tear gas. The police, beating their shields with batons, chased some of the monks and some 200 supporters, while others tried to remain in place near the eastern gate of the pagoda complex.

====September 27====
[[Image:Nagaikenji.jpg|right|thumb|The Japanese reporter [[Kenji Nagai]] is believed to be the only foreign casualty during the crackdown.]]
On September 27, the junta security forces began raiding monasteries across the country to quell the protests, arresting at least 200 monks in Yangon and 500 more in the northeast. There are reports that security forces raided at least five Buddhist monasteries including Ngwe Kya Yan in #3 Block 13th Street, South Okklapah Township and arrested over 200 monks. Security forces broke the wall of Ngwe Kya Yan monastery in a raid at about 0:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. (local time) Thursday morning. Several monks were injured during a clash between the security forces and the monks. "Bleeding monks were forced into a vehicle. They couldn't cover themselves," a local resident told [[Mizzima]]. During the two-hour raid last night, monks rang the alarm bell and screamed for help. As the army has announced it would shoot anybody breaking the curfew, civilians did not dare to come to the aid of monks. Simultaneously, the army raided four other monasteries in parts of Yangon and arrested several monks. Sources confirmed that the army had raided the six storied Religious Science Monastery in Chaukhtatgyi Pagoda, Moe Kaung Monastery in Yan Kin township, Maggin Monastery in Thingankyun township, and Thein Phyu monastery in Thein Phyu area and arrested several monks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mizzima.com/MizzimaNews/News/2007/Sep/Today-demonstration.html Burmese junta raids monasteries, arrests over 200 monks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223100615/http://www.mizzima.com/MizzimaNews/News/2007/Sep/today-demonstration.html |date=2008-02-23 }} Mizzima News, September 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Raids"&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar junta raids monasteries, arrests hundreds of monks |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=2007-09-26 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070926.wjuntaraids0927/BNStory/International |accessdate=2007-09-27 |location=Toronto }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters Raids"&gt;{{cite news|last=Reuters |title=Myanmar junta raids monasteries |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-09-27 |url=http://ca.today.reuters.com/news/NewsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2007-09-27T021914Z_01_B588599_RTRIDST_0_NEWS-MYANMAR-COL.XML |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sky News Raids"&gt;{{cite news|title=Monks arrested in monastery raids|publisher=SKY News|date=2007-09-27|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1285944,00.html|accessdate=2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous diplomat also said the junta claimed soldiers now had the monks "under control" and "would now turn their attention to civilian protesters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irrawaddy.org/headlines/sep28a.php Junta Declares No-go Zones at Buddhist Monasteries]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Irrawaddy, September 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 5,000 people gathered to demonstrate in Mandalay. The military is reported to have locked up and put most monasteries under guard to prevent egress. People gathered at 80th, 84th, 35th, and 33rd Streets, before joining together; three military trucks followed behind them and tried to break up the demonstrators, arresting one student who attempted to cross the road in front of them.

Rights groups report that hundreds of ethnic minority tribespeople are fleeing Burma into the border state of [[Mizoram]], [[India]] to escape the military regime. They claim that they are being forced to join pro-government rallies, in some cases at gunpoint, and if they refuse they face fines of up to 10,000 kyats [$7]; while others have been arrested including Christian pastors. Many of the exodus are from the [[Christian]] minority ethnic [[Chin people]] who say they have been persecuted by the junta for being Christians and non-ethnic Burmese. Although they were initially welcomed in Mizoram after the 1988 military crackdown they now face threats of a pushback, as the [[Mizo people|Mizo]]s, (who are ethnic cousins of Chins), are now strongly opposing "unrestricted migration from the [[Chin State]]" for fear that they may one day be outnumbered by them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7058007.stm/ Burma minority 'fleeing to India'] BBC, Retrieved 24/10/07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=76871] The International News (Pakistan) Retrieved 24/10/07&lt;/ref&gt;
