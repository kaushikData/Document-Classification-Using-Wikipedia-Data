'''Adverse inference''' is a [[Law|legal]] inference, adverse to the concerned party, drawn from silence or absence of requested [[Evidence (law)|evidence]]. It is part of evidence codes based on [[common law]] in various countries.

According to Lawvibe, "the 'adverse inference' can be quite damning at [[trial]]. Essentially, when [[plaintiff]]s try to present evidence on a point essential to their case and can't because the document has been destroyed (by the [[defendant]]), the [[jury]] can infer that the evidence would have been adverse to (the defendant), and adopt the plaintiff’s reasonable interpretation of what the document would have said...."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lawvibe.com/virgin-gets-hammered-by-adverse-inference/|title=Virgin Gets Hammered by Adverse Inference|publisher=LawVibe.com|date=April 4, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117170406/http://www.lawvibe.com/virgin-gets-hammered-by-adverse-inference/|archivedate=November 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the United States ==

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] pointed out in 2004, in a case involving spoliation (destruction) of evidence, that "the giving of an adverse inference instruction often terminates the [[litigation]] in that it is 'too difficult a hurdle' for the [[Spoliation_of_evidence|spoliating party]] to overcome. The court therefore concluded that the adverse inference instruction is an 'extreme' sanction that should 'not be given lightly'...."&lt;ref&gt;Morris v. Union Pacific R. R., 373 F. 3d 896, 900 (8th Cir. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

This rule applies not only to evidence destroyed but also to evidence existing but not produced by the party as well as to evidence under a party's control but not produced. See [[Request for production|Notice to produce]]. The adverse inference is based upon the presumption that the party who controls the evidence would have produced it, if it had been supportive.

It can also apply to a witness known to exist but the party refuses to identify or produce.

== In English law ==

{{See also|Right to silence in England and Wales}}

After a change in the law in 1994, the right to silence under English law was amended because the court and jury were allowed to draw adverse inference from such a silence.&lt;ref name="Baksi 2012"&gt;{{citation |last=Baksi |first=Catherine  |date=24 May 2012 |title=Going "no comment": a delicate balancing act |journal=[[Law Society Gazette]] |url=http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/analysis/going-no-comment-a-delicate-balancing-act/65781.fullarticle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under English law, the police, cautioning someone, say, "You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something which you later rely on in court". Under English law, the court and the jury may draw an adverse inference from fact that someone did not mention a defence when given the chance to do so if charged with an offence.&lt;ref name="Baksi 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |date=26 September 2014 |title=Adverse Inferences |publisher=Crown Prosecution Service |url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/adverse_inferences/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bazley v Curry''''', [1999] 2 SCR 534 is a [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on the topic of [[vicarious liability]] where the Court held that a [[non-profit organization]] may be held vicariously liable in [[tort law]] for sexual misconduct by one of its employees. The decision has widely influenced jurisprudence on vicarious liability outside of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: ''[[Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd]]'', [2001] UKHL 22; and ''[[New South Wales v Lepore]]'', [2003] HCA 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
The Children's Foundation is a provincially funded, non-profit organization which operated two residential care facilities for children aged six to twelve. In April 1966, the foundation employed Leslie Charles Curry to work in its Vancouver home, where he was hired as a childcare counsellor practising "total intervention" in the lives of the children he was caring for. He worked there until March 1980, when the Foundation received a complaint. They investigated and discovered that Curry was in fact a paedophile and had been abusing the children under his care. In 1990 he was charged with 18 counts of gross indecency and two counts of buggery, and was convicted on all but one count, two of those convictions were in relation to the respondent in this case, Patrick Allen Bazley. Curry died not long thereafter. In this case, Bazley sought damages from The Children's Foundation, alleging that they are vicariously liable for the misconduct of its employee.

The main issue in this appeal was whether or not the Children's Foundation should be held vicariously liable for the actions of its employee. There were two questions before the court: May employers be held vicariously liable for sexual assaults on clients or persons within their care?; If so, should non-profit organizations be exempted from liability as a matter of policy?

==Judgment==
The Supreme Court was cautious to allow vicarious liability to be attached to a non-profit organization. McLachlin J (as she then was) points out that vicarious liability is a form of [[strict liability]], or no-fault liability. The Court was very openly concerned with policy in this decision as vicarious liability can be used by litigants to "sue into deeper pockets" even though the litigant may be suing an employer that is not at fault. McLachlin J surveyed a number of possible policy reasons for the imposition of vicarious liability and adopted two of J. G. Fleming's policy rationales:

::(1) providing a just and practical remedy, and
::(2) deterring future harm.&lt;ref&gt;''Bazley v Curry'', [1999] 2 SCR 534 at para 29. See also {{cite book |last=Fleming |first=John G. |title=The Law of Torts |edition=9th |year=1998 |publisher=LBC Information Services |location=Sydney |isbn=9780455215334 |page=410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test for vicarious liability===
In determining if an employer can be found vicariously liable, courts will often use the ''Salmond'' test, which will find an employer liable for the actions of an employee which are:

::(1) acts authorized by the employer or
::(2) acts which are not authorized by the employer, but are so connected to authorized acts that they may be considered "modes" of acts authorized by the employer. 
 
The Supreme Court here seems to express frustration at this test. It is possible to view Curry's actions either completely independently, or as a mode of performing an authorized act. The ''Salmond'' test does not give clear criterion for how differentiate these two. As such, the court clarified the test, saying that the court should consider:

::(1) policy reasons in determining that vicarious liability should or should not apply
::(2) whether the wrongful act is sufficiently related to the employment to justify imposing vicarious liability.

The court went on to explain that vicarious liability is generally appropriate where there is a significant connection between the creation or enhancement of risk and the wrong that flows from the risk. It will not be enough that the wrong took place on company property or through incidental connections.

In this case, because Curry was left alone for long periods of time unsupervised with his victims, was expected to bathe them and was placed by the foundation in a position of power over them, it can be said that there was a strong connection between what the employer was asking the employee to do and the wrongful act committed. The foundation significantly increased the risk of harm, and as such, should be found vicariously liable for Mr. Curry's actions.

===Exception for non-profits?===

The Foundation made three arguments that as a non-profit it should not be found vicariously liable

:* it is unfair to fix liability without fault on non-profit organizations performing needed services on behalf of the community as a whole
:* non-profit charitable organizations often work with volunteers and are thus less able than commercial enterprises to supervise what their agents do
:* vicarious liability will put many non-profit organizations out of business or make it difficult for them to carry on their good work

McLachlin dismissed these arguments as "crass and unsubstantiated utilitarianism" and pointed out:

{{Cquote|
54 ... If, in the final analysis, the choice is between which of two faultless parties should bear the loss &amp;mdash; the party that created the risk that materialized in the wrongdoing or the victim of the wrongdoing &amp;mdash; I do not hesitate in my answer.  Neither alternative is attractive.  But given that a choice must be made, it is fairer to place the loss on the party that introduced the risk and had the better opportunity to control it.
|100%|}}

The appeal was dismissed and the matter was sent back to trial to determine costs.

The below database was produced in 1896 by the American Bureau of Ethnology that identifies all federal land actions within the state of California from 1850 through 1894.  The report was Compiled By Charles C. Royce that covered all decisions and actions around Native American lands nationwide. The full report included an introduction and state by state color coded maps for the entire United States as of the above date.

==California Indian Reservations and Cessions==

The following database is an extraction of all the United State's formal actions between 1851-1892 with California Indians documented by the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]] in its Eighteenth annual report&lt;ref name="Cessions" /&gt; to the Smithsonian Institution in 1896.

==History==

Upon becoming a state in 1850, California was required by law to allow the United States government conduct all formal relationships with tribal communities. Because of California's previous Mexican government had no formal relationships with the Indians following the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|1833 Secularization Act]] that closed the [[Spanish missions in California|Spanish era's Catholic Missions]], most of the 150,000 surviving tribal people either became servants for the [[Ranchos of California]] owners or migrated east to the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Mountains]] or to the north where they mixed with other non Mission tribes that had been left alone by Mexico.

California's farmers and gold miners demanded that Indian "Diggers" and other aliens be heavily taxed or removed from the gold fields. In 1851, at the same time that the United States was setting up the [[Public Land Commission]] as required by the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] with the Republic of Mexico to verify the legality of the [[Ranchos of California]] Land Grants given California citizens prior to 1846, the government also setup a [[Aboriginal title in California#The eighteen unratified treaties|commission]] with military support that resulted in 134 of the state's 300 plus Indian tribes signing 18 treaties that gave away their sovereign rights in exchange for 7.4 million acres of "reservation" lands spread across the state.

[[File:1896 California Map Smithsonian Institute Report.png|thumb|1896 California Map 1 of Indian(First Nations) Cessions and Reservations]]

Between 1851 and 1865, California carried out the wishes of its citizens: the removal of tribal communities from their ancestral lands by military force across California. The United States went along with these actions, rather than using its resources to stop the state from this period of [[California Genocide]] that was legitimized by the 1850 [[Act for the Government and Protection of Indians|Indian Protection Act]] and numerous bond and financing actions that went to [http://www.militarymuseum.org/MilitiaandIndians.html finance dozens of  state militias] that hunted down and killed tribal members.

During the first years between 1851–52, the state of California's U.S. Senator, John Frémont 
Mariposa Brigade rounded up tribal representatives that were living on Senator John Fremont's [[Rancho Las Mariposas|Mariposa Rancho]]. Fremont pushed for federal troops and 3 Indian Commissioners that obtained treaty agreements from representatives to abandon their lands in exchange for what would be the first round of reservations for land actions in California. The state, however, refused to even allow these massive land takeaways, resulting in the initial [https://www.archives.gov/files/publications/prologue/2013/fall-winter/treaties.pdf treaties' failure] and their existence hidden by a Senate order from the public for over 45 years.

One of the three appointed commissioners [[O. M. Wozencraft|Oliver M. Wozencraft]] would report that the government's action would lead to a "war of extermination" against the state's tribal people [http://calindianhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/05_31_1852.pdf on May 31, 1852] but would be [http://calindianhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/09_04_1852_Wozencraft.pdf relieved of his duties] by September of the same year for speaking out, even going public by [http://calindianhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/00_00_1851_To_the_People_Living_and_Trading_Among_the_Indians_in_State_of_CA.pdf publishing a pamphlet] laying out the impacts.

Ths U.S. [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] which was originally part of the [[United States Department of War|U.S. War Department]] would eventually set up four reservations as prescribed by congress that was later followed by tracts of lands ceded to various [[Mission Indians]] located mostly in Southern California. In 1896, the Smithsonian Institution produced a report documenting all historic actions by date and tribe of lands taken from or reservations created by the U.S.

Larisa Miller documented&lt;ref name="Treaty History"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Larisa K.|title=The Secret Treaties With California’s Indians|url=https://www.archives.gov/files/publications/prologue/2013/fall-winter/treaties.pdf|website=Archives.gov|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; how the Northern California Indian Association (NCIA) petitioned President Roosevelt in 1903 to buy federal lands for thousands of homeless Indians across the state because “title and ownership to this beautiful land have never been extinguished." Their campaign led to the rediscovery of the 18 Treaties that were signed by 134 bands of Californians and the removal of the senate's order of secrecy on January 18, 1905.

The United States Bureau of American Ethnology produced annual reports to the Smithsonian Institution on various Native American (First Nation) subjects.

It was Thomas' following statement that set the tone for the introduction:

"Its extent afforded an ample field for the ambition and enterprise of all, and the character, low culture-status, and religious beliefs of the aborigines afforded an apology for considering them a people over whom the superior genius of Europe might rightfully claim an ascendancy. The sovereigns of the Old World therefore found no difficulty in convincing themselves that they made ample compensation to the natives by bestowing on them the benefits of civilization and Christianity in exchange for control over them and their country."

The report included color maps for each state with numbered areas (also in color) to identify each cession or reservation that can be used to locate the land on one of the two maps.  California had two maps, posted above (Plates CXIV &amp; CXV)

This is an extraction of the U.S. governments treaties, reservations and land cessions with California's tribal people between 1851-1986. The California instances in the spreadsheet includes, when found the page number, legal citation and historic materials.  All links embedded in the spreadsheet, including the names identifying which particular "Mission Indian" Tribe have been added to make the original report clearer. Some sections on individual tract [[Public Land Survey System]] have been left out from the original.

The spreadsheet section in part 2, pages 781 - 948 is titled:

==Indian Land Cessions in the United States==

Note that the below database identifies the land involved in each transaction with a number that can be located on the above maps. Later transactions are located on the 2nd map or "Ca-2", plus the appropriate number. The first 18 entries described below as unratified treaties were not listed in the 1896 Smithsonian report, but as stated lands ceded in exchange for tracts of land.

Nov. 25, 1856, the Secretary of the Interior ordered its reduction to 25,000 acres, to bring it within the limits prescribed by act of Mar. 3, 1855. The boundaries of the reduced reserve were never surveyed. Subsequently, ex-superintendent Beale and others obtained patents under old Spanish grants for most of the land covered by the original reserve. Measures were therefore taken to remove the Indians and to abandon the reserve. The last of the Indians were removed to Tule River reserve, as reported by Superintendent Wiley, July 11, 1864. The tract shown on the map exhibits the boundaries of the reserve as originally surveyed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indians were at once removed to Smith River reservation. Though not formally relinquished, the Klamath was not thereafter occupied as an Indian reservation until 1877, when the Commissioner of Indian. Affairs asked that the War Department remove white trespassers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1482">'''Character''' is the type of income to calculate the taxpayer's tax liability.  In the United States, the [[U.S. Supreme Court | Supreme Court]] decided ( [[Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co.]]) that income is an accession to wealth, however [[capital gain]] is of different character from [[ordinary income]].  Ordinary income includes [[earned wage income]] and [[interest income]] from lending.
==Capital Income==
===U.S.===
The [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] characterizes income or loss as a capital gain or loss depending on how the taxpayer generates the gain or loss.  When the taxpayer invests in real estate or [[security (finance) | security]] and then later sells that piece of real estate or security, the IRS characterizes the amount that exceeds the purchase price as capital income while the amount that falls short of the purchase price is capital loss.  The IRS refers to the purchase price as the [[tax basis]].

When the IRS characterizes income as capital gain, it enjoys a lower tax rate than ordinary income.

==Ordinary Income==
===U.S.===
The IRS characterizes ordinary income as income generated from earned wage income or interest income earned from lending.

The IRS taxes ordinary income according to a progressive rate determined by the amount of income.  It is a [[progressive income tax]].

{{Banking in the United States}}

The '''Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act''' (or '''Check 21 Act''') is a [[United States federal law]], {{USPL|108|100}}, that was enacted on October 28, 2003 by the [[108th United States Congress|108th U.S. Congress]]. The Check 21 Act took effect one year later on October 28, 2004.  The law allows the recipient of the original paper [[cheque|check]] to create a digital version of the original check, a process known as [[Cheque truncation|check truncation]], into an electronic format called a "[[substitute check]]", thereby eliminating the need for further handling of the physical document. In essence, the recipient bank no longer returns the paper check, but effectively e-mails an image of both sides of the check to the bank it is drawn upon. 

[[Consumer]]s are most likely to see the effects of this act when they notice that certain checks (or images thereof) are no longer being returned to them with their monthly statement, even though other checks are still being returned. Another effect of the law is that it is now legal for anyone to use a computer scanner or [[mobile phone]] to capture images of checks and deposit them electronically, a process known as [[remote deposit]].

Check 21 is not subject to [[ACH Network|ACH]] rules, therefore transactions are not subject to [[NACHA]] (The Electronic Payments Association) rules, regulations, fees and fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aba.com/Tools/Function/Payments/Documents/e384418906ca4bda86080c78bc729996ResourceDocument.pdf|title=Check 21 Resource Document|last=|first=|date=|website=aba.com|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Truncation ==
{{main | Cheque truncation}}

The Act lets banks take advantage of image technologies and electronic transport while not being dependent on other banks being ready to settle transactions with images instead of paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wbsarchive.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/check-21-e28093-check-based-payments-in-transition-in-the-u-s-a.doc|title=Check 21 – US Check based payments in transition|accessdate=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of removing the paper check from its processing flow is called "[[check truncation]]". In truncation, both sides of the paper check are scanned to produce a digital image. If a paper document is still needed, these images are inserted into specially formatted documents containing a photo-reduced copy of the original checks called a "[[substitute check]]".

Once a check is truncated, businesses and banks can work with either the digital image or a print reproduction of it. Images can be exchanged between member banks, [[savings and loan]]s, [[credit union]]s, servicers, [[clearing house (finance)|clearinghouses]], and the [[Federal Reserve Bank]].

{{cns|Not all banks have the ability to receive image files, so there are companies who offer the service. At the item processing center, the checks are sorted by machine according to the routing/transit ([[ABA routing transit number|RT]]) number as presented by the [[magnetic ink character recognition]] (MICR) line, and scanned to produce a digital image. A batch file is generated and sent to the Federal Reserve Bank or presentment point for settlement or image replacement. If a substitute check is needed, the transmitting bank is responsible for the cost of generating and transporting it from the presentment point to the Federal Reserve Bank or other corresponding bank.|date=December 2015}}

==Effects and developments==
===Remote deposit===
{{cns|Check 21 has also spawned a new bank treasury management product known as [[remote deposit]].  This process allows depositing customers the ability to capture front and rear images of checks along with their respective [[MICR]] data for those being deposited.  This data is then uploaded to their depositing institution, and the customer's account is then credited.  Remote deposit therefore precludes the need for merchants and other large depositors to travel to the bank (or branch) to physically make a deposit.|date=December 2015}}

{{cns|In addition to remote deposit, other such electronic depositing options are available to qualifying bank customers through [[NACHA]].  These options include "[[Point of Purchase]] Entry" (POP) and "Back Office Conversion Entry" (BOC) for retailers, and "Accounts Receivable Entry" (ARC) for high volume remittance receivers.  These transactions are not covered under the Check 21 legislation, but rather are electronic conversions of the checks' MICR data into an [[ACH Network|ACH]] debit.  This can help the depositor save on the costs of transporting checks and in bank fees.  However, the liability changes from [[Regulation CC]] of the Federal Reserve to [[Regulation E]], which provides much more protection for the account being debited and therefore more risk to the merchant and originating bank.|date=December 2015}}

==Patents==

There are a number of patents relating to "check collection systems",&lt;ref name="budget"&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/89xx/doc8981/s1145.pdf Congressional Budget Office Cost Report], pages 2, 5 and 11&lt;/ref&gt; including some owned by [[DataTreasury]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Lerer, [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0308/9202.html "Senate, old legal woes drawn into patent fight"], politico.com, March 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2316">The '''''Connecticut Law Review''''' is a [[law review]] produced by [[University of Connecticut School of Law]] students. The ''Review'' publishes more than 1,000 pages of critical legal discussion each year and is managed entirely by a student board of editors, who solicit, edit, and publish articles and [[book review]]s written by scholars, [[judge]]s, and practicing [[Attorney at law|attorneys]]. Much of the content of the ''Review'' is written by students.

Subscribers to the ''Review'' include law offices and [[Law library|law libraries]] throughout the country and abroad, and the ''Review'' is often cited in briefs, [[court opinion]]s, and legal texts. Membership on the ''Connecticut Law Review'' provides many opportunities and benefits. Established in 1968, the ''Review'' is the oldest and largest student-run organization at the University of Connecticut School of Law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46540">'''Copyright Alert System''' ('''CAS''') was a voluntary industry effort to educate and penalize internet users who engage in the unauthorized and unlawful distribution of [[copyright]]ed works via [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] services. The program was operated by the [[Center for Copyright Information]], a consortium consisting of the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), and the [[internet service provider]]s [[AT&amp;T]], [[Cablevision]], [[Comcast]], [[Time Warner Cable]], and [[Verizon]].&lt;ref name=farivar&gt;{{cite news

The CAS used a [[graduated response]] system (also known as the '''"six strikes program"'''), in which participating ISPs would send warnings notifying subscribers of alleged copyright infringement, as reported by a monitoring service working on behalf of participating copyright owners.&lt;ref name="cci_press_release"&gt;Brimmeier, Khristyn.

After a fifth warning, ISPs were allowed to implement "mitigation measures", which could include penalties such as [[bandwidth throttling]] or preventing web access until customers "discuss the matter" with their ISP.&lt;ref name="agreementars"&gt;{{cite web | last = Anderson | first = Nate | title = Major ISPs agree to "six strikes" copyright enforcement plan | publisher = Ars Technica | date = July 7, 2011 | url = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/07/major-isps-agree-to-six-strikes-copyright-enforcement-plan/ | accessdate = 2013-02-26 }}

The CAS framework was established on July 7, 2011 after three years in the making.&lt;ref name="cci_press_release" /&gt; After multiple delays, ISPs began implementing it in late February 2013.&lt;ref name="implementationrollout"&gt;{{cite web | last = Farivar | first = Cyrus | title = "Six strikes" enforcement policy debuts | publisher = Ars Technica | date = Feb 25, 2013 | url = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/02/six-strikes-enforcement-policy-debuts/ | accessdate = 2013-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lesser|first=Jill|title=Copyright Alert System Set to Begin|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/uncategorized/copyright-alert-system-set-to-begin/|work=Center For Copyright Information|publisher=Center For Copyright Information|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAS discontinued the program on January 30, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RIP, "Six Strikes" Copyright Alert System|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/01/rip-six-strikes-copyright-alert-system/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Center for Copyright Information employed the services of [[MarkMonitor]] (often doing business as DtecNet) to detect and monitor suspected copyright infringement activity.&lt;ref name=EFF201211&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/us-copyright-surveillance-machine-about-be-switched-on |title=U.S. Copyright Surveillance Machine About To Be Switched On, Promises of Transparency Already Broken |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=15 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although MarkMonitor monitored many infringement venues, in early 2013 the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) said it appeared that for purposes of the CAS, the company will only monitor peer-to-peer traffic from public [[BitTorrent tracker]]s.&lt;ref name=EFF_FAQ&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/six-strikes-copyright-alert-system-faq&lt;/ref&gt; The Copyright Alert System does not use [[deep packet inspection]].&lt;ref name=mueller-kuehn-santoso/&gt;{{rp|361}}

A review of MarkMonitor's system for the CAS stated that only uploads were monitored, with infringement being suspected when MarkMonitor's BitTorrent client successfully obtains pieces of known-infringing content from a peer in the swarm. The pieces were compared to pieces from an already-downloaded copy of the content, which had already been matched to content samples supplied by the copyright owners.&lt;ref name=Stroz/&gt;

When suspected infringement was detected, the ISP for the [[IP address]] associated with the suspicious activity was notified. The ISP, in turn, notified the subscriber to whom the IP address was assigned at the time of the alleged infringement, informing the subscriber that their account was suspected of being used to infringe copyright, and warning of potential consequences. Users who continue to receive warnings could be issued up to six alerts in the form of pop-up messages and e-mails before stronger measures were taken by the ISP.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Intent==
The Copyright Alert System was intended to be {{cquote|a consumer-focused process for identifying and notifying residential wired Internet access service customers of the participating ISPs (other than dial-up subscribers) who receive multiple notifications of allegations of online infringement made via P2P networks and applications, in an effort to educate consumers, deter online infringement, and direct consumers to lawful online legitimate sources of content online.&lt;ref name=MOU/&gt;}}

The Center for Copyright Information believed that the Copyright Alert System would be effective in reducing both intentional and unintentional copyright infringement. By providing willing infringers with information regarding the serious consequences of copyright infringement, the CCI hoped to steer would-be infringers to legal online content providers. The CCI hoped that unwitting infringers, such as those whose home networks have been hijacked by unauthorized users or the parents of children who are infringing, would use the knowledge that their account is being used for copyright infringement to force users of the account to curtail these activities. The CCI also hoped to increase parents' involvement in what their children are doing online by alerting misconduct and abuse of their accounts.&lt;ref name="FlintLATimes"&gt;Joe Flint, [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/07/entertainment-giants-and-broadband-providers-team-up-on-piracy-effort.html "Entertainment giants and broadband providers team up on piracy effort"], Los Angeles Times, July 6, 2011. Retrieved November 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFF claimed the materials used to "educate consumers" were "more like propaganda", and that the framework violated the principle of [[presumption of innocence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/us-copyright-surveillance-machine-about-be-switched-on|date=November 15, 2012|title=U.S. Copyright Surveillance Machine About To Be Switched On, Promises of Transparency Already Broken|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alerts==
The system of alerts was as follows:

* The first and second alerts notified ISP subscribers that their Internet account has allegedly been used for copyright infringement, provided an explanation of how to avoid future offenses, and directed users to lawful content sites.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;
* If the suspicious behavior persisted, additional alerts were sent. These alerts ask the subscriber to acknowledge receipt of the messages by clicking a notice.
* After a fifth alert, ISPs were allowed to take "mitigation measures" to prevent future infringement.
* If the ISP did not institute a mitigation measure following the fifth alert, it had to enact one after the sixth alert.

Mitigation measures included: "temporary reductions of Internet speeds, redirection to a landing page until the subscriber contacts the ISP to discuss the matter or reviews and responds to some educational information about copyright, or other measures (as specified in published policies) that the ISP may deem necessary to help resolve the matter".&lt;ref name="FAQs"&gt;[http://www.copyrightinformation.org/faq Center for Copyright Information FAQs] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66gWCLxtq?url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/faq |date=2012-04-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mitigation measures varied by company. [[Verizon]] was the first to reveal their mitigation policy. Their policy specified that violators with more than three alerts would be directed to an online copyright law information. Upon a fifth or sixth alert, the user would experience a temporary speed reduction down to 256kbit/s (approximately the speed of dial-up internet access).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Kevin|title=LEAKED: Verizon's New Anti-Piracy Measure Will Give Offenders 6 Chances|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/verizon-anti-piracy-gives-6-chances-2013-1|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a leaked internal document, [[AT&amp;T]] decided that after a 6th alert, a user's "access to many of the most frequently visited websites [would be] restricted" until they completed an "online educational tutorial on copyright".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Jeff|title=AT&amp;T Could Block Facebook, The Pirate Bay And Others When 'Six Strike' Program Begins Next Month|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/att-could-block-facebook-pirate-bay-others-when-six-strike-program-begins-next-month-845709|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[AT&amp;T]] later explained that it would not cut the user off the internet even though such measure appeared in the copyright warning letter. It gave a reason that the six strikes warnings are only allegations; therefore, if the alleged user was still suspected of illegal downloading after completion of the "online educational tutorial on copyright" and the six strikes warnings, unless the copyright owner took legal action; nothing would happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bort|first=Julie|title=AT&amp;T Promises (Again) Not To Disconnect Your Account If It Suspects You Of Illegal Downloading|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/att-wont-disconnect-over-six-strikes-2013-9|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Warner Cable]] stated that it would not discontinue customers' service, but instead redirect users to educational pages on copyright law upon multiple violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|title=Cable companies say they won't disconnect accused pirates|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57550782-38/cable-companies-say-they-wont-disconnect-accused-pirates/|publisher=CNET|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCI said that at no point in the process would the ISPs reveal customer information to the CCI, the monitoring service, or the copyright owners.&lt;ref name=cas-faqs&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright Alert System FAQs|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/resources-faq/copyright-alert-system-faqs/|work=The Copyright Alert System|publisher=Center for Copyright Information|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFF said that because the system "will not identify those who take steps to anonymize their Internet traffic using a VPN or Tor" it would not stop dedicated infringers.&lt;ref name=EFF_FAQ/&gt;

The EFF also argued that the mitigation measures to be undertaken by ISPs in response to alleged copyright infringement were overly harsh, as they could be used to deny consumers access to the Internet, which EFF maintained is as fundamental a right in the digital era as access to other utilities such as electricity.&lt;ref name="EFFReaction" /&gt; Annemarie Bridy wrote that although temporary suspension was a possible mitigation measure, market pressure would discourage ISPs from using it, instead relying on more educational measures.&lt;ref name=bridy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bridy|first=Annemarie|title=Graduated Response American Style: "Six Strikes" Measured Against Five Norms|journal=Fordham Intellectual Property, Media &amp; Entertainment Law Journal|year=2012|volume=23|pages=1–66|ssrn=2145059|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39–40}} Mueller, Kuehn, and Santoso attributed the ISPs' adoption of the Copyright Alert System to its voluntary nature and the fact the ISPs were not required to terminate accounts under the Copyright Alert System.&lt;ref name=mueller-kuehn-santoso /&gt;{{rp|361}}

==Appeal process==
The CAS process did not allow alerts to be challenged until a mitigation measure was about to be imposed.&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent&gt;{{cite web|title=What Do I Do if I Think the Alert Was Wrongly Sent|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/the-copyright-alert-system/what-do-i-do-if-i-think-the-alert-was-wrongly-sent/|work=The Copyright Alert System|publisher=Center for Copyright Information|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the subscriber could request, through a special link provided by their ISP, a special [[arbitration]] proceeding.&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt; The proceeding would be administered by the [[American Arbitration Association]] (AAA),&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt; and the arbitrator would be selected by the AAA.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|33}} The process was "automated to the maximum extent practicable",&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|33}} with the intent of resolving the dispute within thirty days of filing.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|37}}

The appeal had to be requested within 14 days of the alert triggering the mitigation measure.&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt; The subscriber had to pay a $35 filing fee, unless the fee was waived by the AAA.&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt; According to CCI Executive Director Jill Lesser, the $35 fee "defray[ed] a small part of the cost of the appeal and [was] intended to discourage frivolous appeals".&lt;ref name=congressional-internet-caucus&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Congressional Internet Caucus Meets on Copyright and Piracy|url=http://www.c-span.org/Events/Congressional-Internet-Caucus-Meets-on-Copyright-and-Piracy/10737438657-1/ |accessdate=2013-05-12 |time=19:52 |publisher=C-SPAN| date=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevail, the subscriber had to successfully challenge a specified number of alerts (possibly more than one) to block the mitigation measure and receive a refund of the filing fee.&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt;

Subscribers could only challenge alerts on one or more of the following pre-defined grounds:&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt;&lt;ref name="review-grounds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/resources-faq/independent-review-faqs/what-are-the-grounds-for-requesting-a-review/ |title=What are the Grounds for Requesting a Review? |publisher=Center for Copyright Information |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Misidentification of Account – The subscriber's account was incorrectly identified as a source of copyright infringement.
* Unauthorized Use of Account – The alleged infringement was the result of unauthorized, unpreventable use of the subscriber's account by others, without the subscriber's knowledge.
* Authorization – The subscriber's use of the work identified in the alert was specifically authorized in writing by the work's copyright owner or someone with a license to reproduce the work.&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|36}}
* Fair Use – The subscriber's use of the work identified in the alert meets the U.S. legal definition of [[fair use]].
* Misidentification of File – The file "did not consist primarily of the alleged copyrighted work at issue but rather contained other non-infringing material".
* Work Published Before 1923 – The work identified in the alert was published prior to 1923 and therefore is in the [[public domain]] in the United States.

In an appeal, the burden of proof was on the subscriber to demonstrate the elements of one of the above grounds for challenging an alert.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|34}}

The choice of defenses allowed in an appeal was criticized. The defense of unauthorized use of account was not allowed if the user was a member of the subscriber's household or an invitee, and after the first assertion of this defense, the subscriber had to demonstrate by "clear and convincing evidence" that the subscriber "took reasonable steps to secure the account following the first occurrence of unauthorized use".&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|35}} Bridy wrote that this creates an obligation for subscribers to secure their Internet connection even when they had no legal or contractual obligation to do so.&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|35–36}} In an ''Ars Technica'' article, Cyrus Farivar said that the responsibility placed on the subscriber by the CAS for copyright infringement that occurred using the subscriber's connection would harm the availability of open Wi-Fi that small businesses make available to their customers.&lt;ref name=farivar /&gt; In a CCI blog post, Jill Lesser responded that many businesses with open Wi-Fi had business accounts, which were not subject to the CAS. Lesser also said that businesses offering open Wi-Fi through residential accounts would be subject to the CAS, but those accounts, like others subject to the CAS, would not be subject to termination.&lt;ref name=lesser&gt;{{cite web|last=Lesser|first=Jill|title=CAS Will Not Harm Public Wi-Fi|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/uncategorized/cas-will-not-harm-public-wi-fi/|publisher=Center for Copyright Information|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense of publication before 1923 was the only allowable challenge to the copyright status of a work, even though a work may have been out of copyright protection for other reasons.&lt;ref name=EFF_FAQ /&gt;&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|36}} LaFrance criticized the presence of the "work published before 1923" defense but not other factual challenges to the copyright status of the work that she said could just as easily be resolved through the appeal process.&lt;ref name=lafrance /&gt;{{rp|178}}

The subscriber's personal information was not shared with the copyright holder in the appeal process unless the subscriber asserted the defense of authorization and the arbitrator deemed disclosure necessary for the copyright holder to respond to the defense.&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|50}} Bridy favorably compared the privacy of an appeal proceeding to the previous system of "mass John Doe litigation".&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|51}} The appeals process involved no hearings and no [[discovery (law)|discovery]], although the arbitrator could demand additional information from either party.&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|54}}

The CCI said that subscribers may also challenge alerts or mitigation measures in court;&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt; Bridy presumed that such a challenge could be made in the form of a request for [[declaratory judgment]] that the subscriber did not infringe.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|55}}
Mary LaFrance wrote that the system prevented any party from introducing a decision from the appeal process into any judicial proceeding.&lt;ref name=lafrance&gt;{{cite journal|last=LaFrance|first=Mary|title=Graduated Response by Industry Compact: Piercing the Black Box|journal=Cardozo Arts &amp; Entertainment Law Journal|year=2012|volume=30|pages=165–186|url=http://www.cardozoaelj.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/LaFrance.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|175}} According to the CCI, the failure of a subscriber to appeal a copyright alert under the Copyright Alert System "will not be construed as an admission or waiver in any other proceeding".&lt;ref name=independent-review-faqs&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Review FAQs|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/resources-faq/independent-review-faqs/|work=The Copyright Alert System|publisher=Center for Copyright Information|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridy wrote that the copyright law applied in independent reviews would be determined by an expert commissioned by the American Arbitration Association and approved by CCI, who was required to hear "prevailing legal principles" of copyright law as viewed by copyright owners.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|55}} Bridy suggested that the legal standards in an independent review would call into question the fairness of the independent review proceeding, citing what she said were inaccurate statements from the RIAA on copyright.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|56}} Bridy also said that the lack of written decisions in the independent review process would make it difficult to determine what the rules are for independent review or whether they are being followed.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|57}}

The EFF said that the mitigation measures could be imposed without any [[due process]], placing the burden of proof on consumers to show that allegations of copyright infringement are unfounded. The organization recommended that, in the absence of copyright infringement detection systems which have been demonstrated to be entirely accurate, the burden of proof be placed on the content providers to show copyright infringement prior to the mitigation measures. Bridy wrote that IP address collection and content identification methods should be held to a much higher standard (including review by an independent expert with no contractual obligations to the CCI nor non-disclosure obligations), especially since an alert itself could trigger a sanction.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|53}}

The EFF argued that the procedure for objecting to an alert was unfairly burdensome to the consumer and biased towards the media companies.&lt;ref name="EFFReaction" /&gt; Bridy said that because the Copyright Alert System arose from a mass consumer contract, the potential for the [[repeat-player effect]] to jeopardize the neutrality of the arbitrators was present.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|55}} However, Bridy wrote that the independent review process was optional, and users were free to go to court to remove alerts or challenge mitigation measures, unlike in other consumer contracts where arbitration was mandatory. Although Bridy said that few subscribers would go to court owing to the possibility of a large damages award, this alternative allowed for full due process safeguards.&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|55}}

According to a May 2014 report by the Center for Copyright Information, from the implementation of the Copyright Alert System through the end of 2013, there were 265 appeals, representing 0.27% of the alerts triggering a mitigation measure for which the appeal process was available.&lt;ref name=copyright-alert-system-phase-one /&gt;{{rp|2}} Of the appeals, 47 (17.7%) were successful, the "vast majority" of which involved the "unauthorized use of account" defense.&lt;ref name=copyright-alert-system-phase-one&gt;{{cite web|title=The Copyright Alert System: Phase One and Beyond|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Phase-One-And_Beyond.pdf|accessdate=29 May 2014|author=Center for Copyright Information|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name=kravets&gt;{{cite web|last=Kravets|first=David|title=ISPs sent 1.3M copyright infringement notices to US customers last year|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/isps-sent-1-3m-copyright-infringement-notices-to-us-customers-last-year/|work=Ars Technica|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In none of the appeals was it determined that an account or copyrighted work was misidentified.&lt;ref name=copyright-alert-system-phase-one /&gt;{{rp|10}}

The negotiating parties completed a [[memorandum of understanding|Memorandum of Understanding]] in July 2011 and amended it in August 2011 and October 2012.&lt;ref name=MOU&gt;[http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Memorandum-of-Understanding.pdf Memorandum of Understanding]; [http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CCI-MOU-First-Amendment.pdf Aug. 2011 amendment]; [http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CCI-MOU-Second-Amendment.pdf Oct. 2012 amendment].&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement establishes the framework for the Copyright Alert System, establishing the roles and expectations of the ISPs, the copyright owners, and the monitoring services.

The Copyright Alert System launched in late February 2013.&lt;ref name="implementationrollout"/&gt;

The EFF cited a number of problems with the Memorandum of Understanding.&lt;ref name="EFFReaction"&gt;McSherry, Corynne and Goldman, Eric, [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/graduated-response-deal-what-if-users-had-been "The "Graduated Response" Deal: What if Users Had Been At the Table?"], Electronic Frontier Foundation, July 18, 2011. Retrieved November 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the EFF criticized the lack of subscriber representation in the CCI, noting that the establishment of the CCI involved only large media corporations and ISPs, but left out representatives of the subscribers who purchase these companies' products. Further, the CCI only allowed for a three-person advisory board from consumer interest groups, while the executive board is composed of six representatives from the media companies and ISPs, an arrangement which the EFF believed to be inadequate for consumer representation.

===Technology review===
The CCI contracted with [[Stroz Friedberg]], a global digital risk management and investigations firm, to conduct an analysis of MarkMonitor's system for monitoring, verifying, and enforcing online copyright infringement on P2P file sharing networks.&lt;ref name=Stroz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Independent-Expert-Assessment-Content-CCI-Redacted.pdf |title=Independent Expert Assessment of MarkMonitor AntiPiracy Methodologies [Redacted] |date=November 1, 2012 |accessdate=2013-03-03 |author=Stroz Friedberg, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stroz Friedberg assessed the efficacy of MarkMonitor's methodologies to monitor, identify, collect evidence, and generate notices to P2P infringers&lt;ref name=Stroz/&gt; The contractor published the findings in a confidential report to the CCI in November 2012 (i.e., before the system launched), concluding that the methodologies were "well developed and robust", though not without room for improvement.&lt;ref name=Stroz/&gt;

The publicly released version of the report contained a number of redactions of various details.&lt;ref name=Stroz/&gt; Among the report's conclusions were the following claims:&lt;ref name=Stroz/&gt;
* "MarkMonitor's methodologies effectively identify P2P online copyright infringers".
* "MarkMonitor's evidence collection in connection with P2P infringement is robust, defensible, and will withstand adverse party scrutiny or evidentiary challenges".
* "The methodologies include appropriate checks and balances at key points in the workflow to ensure accuracy".

Although both the CCI and Stroz Friedberg claimed the review was independent, the CCI didn't release the Stroz Friedberg report until after media reports surfaced that Stroz Friedberg was an RIAA [[lobbying]] organization from 2004 to 2009.&lt;ref name="EFF201211"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ArsBio&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/03/riaa-lobbyist-becomes-federal-judge-rules-on-file-sharing-cases/ |title=RIAA lobbyist becomes federal judge, rules on file-sharing cases |date=Mar 28, 2011 |last=Anderson | first=Nate |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm's sole lobbyist for the RIAA (and, briefly, [[Universal Music Group]])&lt;ref name=ArsBio/&gt;&lt;ref name=UMG_lobbying&gt;Stroz Frieberg lobbying data (public record) as published by OpenSecrets.org for [http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmlbs.php?id=F27199&amp;year=2005 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Beryl A.

In response to the "questions" raised, the CCI issued a statement reaffirming confidence in Stroz Friedberg's propriety and announcing the public release of the report, but also conceding, {{cquote|we are, however, sensitive to any appearance that Stroz lacks independence, and so CCI has decided to have another expert review Stroz's initial evaluation of the content community's processes.

The CCI also hired Stroz Friedberg to review the accuracy of the system by which ISPs match the IP addresses of suspected infringers to the ISPs' subscribers. The results of that review have not yet been publicly released.&lt;ref name=EFF201211/&gt;

In August 2013, the CCI announced it had hired [[Avi Rubin]]'s high-tech litigation consulting firm Harbor Labs to conduct a follow-up review.&lt;ref name=rubin&gt;{{cite web |url=https://torrentfreak.com/six-strikes-anti-piracy-system-gets-new-evidence-review-130817/ |title=Six Strikes Anti-Piracy System Gets New Evidence Review |date=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Harbor Labs completed a limited review of MarkMonitor's system, concluding that the technical design was generally sound, but that the company needs to improve its safeguards against human error and internal malfeasance.&lt;ref name="harbor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Harbor-Labs-Executive-Summary.pdf |title=Evaluation of the MarkMonitor AntiPiracy System |date=March 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of the report was publicly disclosed when the CCI posted the report's executive summary eight months later.

==Reception and controversy==
&lt;!--NOTE TO EDITORS: Opinions in reliable sources about specific aspects of the CAS should be placed in the appropriate section. --&gt;
The White House supported the Memorandum of Understanding, calling it "a positive step and consistent with our strategy of encouraging voluntary efforts to strengthen online intellectual property enforcement and with our broader Internet policy principles, emphasizing privacy, free speech, competition and due process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/07/07/working-together-stop-internet-piracy|publisher=White House|date=July 7, 2011|title=Working Together to Stop Internet Piracy|last=Espinel|first=Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the CAS was criticized for a perceived lack of public input, [[perverse incentive]]s between media corporations and ISPs, harsh mitigation measures, and reversal of [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] standards.&lt;ref name="TechDirt"&gt;Masnick, Mike, [http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110707/10173014998/major-us-isps-agree-to-five-strikes-plan-rather-than-three.shtml "Major US ISPs Agree To Five Strikes Plan, Rather Than Three"], Techdirt.com, July 7, 2011. Retrieved November 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The EFF made particularly detailed criticisms.&lt;ref name="EFFSameDay"&gt;Phillips, Abigail, [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/content-industry-and-isps-announce-common "The Content Industry and ISPs Announce a "Common Framework for Copyright Alerts": What Does it Mean for Users?"], Electronic Frontier Foundation, July 7, 2011. Retrieved November 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, a [[Freedom of Information Act]] request related to the White House's role in the policy was denied by a Washington D.C. federal court.&lt;ref name="ars1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/federal-court-obama-admin-doesnt-need-to-release-more-six-strikes-documents/ | title=Federal court: Obama admin doesn't need to release more "six strikes" documents | publisher=Ars Technica | accessdate=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Soghoian, a policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), submitted the request to obtain information about the interaction in creating the policy.&lt;ref name=ars1 /&gt; It was denied in a summary judgement by Judge Royce C. Lamberth.&lt;ref name=ars1 /&gt; Lamberth's judgement rests on an exemption for drafts and "...reducing the possibility of misleading the public by disclosing documents that suggest certain reasons for a future decision that do not ultimately bear upon that decision".&lt;ref name=ars1 /&gt;

In 2012, the California ISP [[Sonic.net]] CEO told [[TorrentFreak]] that his ISP will not be participating in the Copyright Alert System, saying that ISPs are not equipped to police the actions of individuals, and that the [[MPAA]] and [[RIAA]] have not invited small, independent ISPs to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Has Your ISP Joined the US "Six Strikes" Anti-Piracy Scheme?|url=http://torrentfreak.com/isp-six-strikes-anti-piracy-scheme-120803/|accessdate=7 August 2012|newspaper=TorrentFreak|date=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly a representative of Cox Communications told TorrentFreak that they "have decided not to participate for internal reasons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ernesto|last=Van der Sar|title=MPAA / RIAA PONDER SUING PERSISTENT BITTORRENT PIRATES|url=http://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-riaa-ponder-suing-persistent-bittorrent-pirates-120618/|publisher=TorrentFreak|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the CAS' launch, concern existed that data collected for the CAS would be used for more than just the stated "educational" purposes. In the first draft of the CCI's Memorandum of Understanding, it was stated that upon that ISPs would be responsible for providing information collected under the CAS program to Content Owners "if it elects to initiate a legal action against the subscriber". The final agreed Memorandum of Understanding replaced the term "legal action" with "copyright infringement action". [footnote 12 – MOU Art 4 g iv.] Two months after the CAS's implementation, [[Verizon]] was subpoenaed to provide a third party plaintiff with information on its users which it recorded for CAS purposes. The plaintiff, Malibu Media argued that "DMCA notices and six strike alerts are relevant because these notices may prove a pattern of infringement and/or notice that infringement is occurring could be used to show a pattern of infringing behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malibu Media LLC v.

With this information, Malibu Media was able to successfully litigate the first BitTorrent copyright infringement case in American legal history which concluded with a verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bellwether Trial (Malibu Media v.

===Open wireless networks===
Tech law professor Derek Bambauer of the [[University of Arizona]], told [[Ars Technica]] that the Copyright Alert System "is fundamentally flawed". Bambauer says that injustice could result in the case where a user legally downloaded an entire work under the doctrine of [[fair use]], but the CAS still treated the user as an infringer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weber|first=Peter|title=The anti-piracy Copyright Alert System: Is the Napster era finally dead?|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/240718/the-anti-piracy-copyright-alert-system-is-the-napster-era-finally-dead|publisher=The Week Publications|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFF said that the CAS will hinder the Open Wireless Movement's goals. Jill Lesser, Executive Director of the Center for Copyright Information, said that the CAS will affect small businesses that use a residential connection for open Wi-Fi: "Depending on the type of Internet service they subscribe to, very small businesses like a home-office or a local real estate office may have an Internet connection that is similar from a network perspective to a residential connection... The practical result is that if an employee of the small business, or someone using an open Wi-Fi connection at the business, engages in infringing activity the primary account owner would receive alerts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kamdar|first=Adi|title=Don't Be Fooled: "Six Strikes" Will Undoubtedly Harm Open Wireless|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/six-strikes-undoubtedly-harm-open-wireless|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects since implementation===
[[File:Copyright-alerts-chart.svg|thumb|300px|Distribution of the number of copyright alerts received by accounts during the first ten months of implementation of the Copyright Alert System.]]
According to Jill Lesser, the Executive Director of the CCI, the CAS's first year was successful as the CAS is "intended to be education based".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tummarello|first=Kate|title='Six strikes' thwarting piracy, leader says|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/199124-six-strikes-thwarting-piracy-leader-says|publisher=The Hill|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lesser indicated that changes for 2014 might include expanding the program to more Internet service providers and also start including other forms of copyrighted media, such as software. In the first year of the CAS's existence, US traffic to The Pirate Bay increased by 31 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ernesto|title=SIX-STRIKES FAILS TO HALT U.S. PIRATE BAY GROWTH|url=http://torrentfreak.com/six-strikes-fails-to-halt-u-s-pirate-bay-growth-130903/|publisher=Torrent Freak|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013 Warner Brothers Studios began sending warning to users whose internet service was provided by an entity other than one of the five ISP partners of the CCI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Jared|title=Warner Bros. fines file-sharers, even without six strikes|url=http://www.techhive.com/article/2041027/warner-bros-fines-file-sharers-even-without-six-strikes.html|publisher=TechHives|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Variety revealed that engineers at [[Comcast]] and [[NBC Universal]] were developing technology designed to recognize the illegal downloading of copyrighted material by its users and launch a pop-up window with links to legal access to such content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallenstein|first=Andrew|title=Comcast Developing Anti-Piracy Alternative to 'Six Strikes' (Exclusive)|url=https://variety.com/2013/digital/news/comcast-developing-anti-piracy-alternative-to-six-strikes-exclusive-1200572790/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not a CCI-backed initiative, but rather was viewed as a potential supplement to the CAS as Comcast had begun approaching other content owners and ISPs to explore the concept with them. In the CAS's first year, [[Comcast]], the nation's largest ISP, sent out 625,000 warnings to its users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morran|first=Chris|title=COMCASTIC 3 Report: Comcast Sends Out Around 1,800 Copyright Alert Notices Each Day|url=http://consumerist.com/2014/02/07/report-comcast-sends-out-around-1800-copyright-alert-notices-each-day/|publisher=Consumerist|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Largely seen as another supplement to the CAS, in September 2013, AT&amp;T applied for a patent for technology that would allow the company to "prevent bandwidth abuse" by tracking the content its users are sharing via BitTorrent and other P2P networks in order to charge its users for excessive bandwidth use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morran|first=Chris|title=DISPATCH FROM THE DEATH STAR 1 AT&amp;T Patents System That Could Charge File-Sharers Extra For Data|url=http://consumerist.com/2014/01/31/att-patents-system-that-could-charge-file-sharers-extra-for-data/|publisher=Consumerisst|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commuters in the Twin Cities metro area are getting daily reminders of why they need to get tested}}&lt;/ref&gt; In banking, officers tasked with making sure the bank follows proper regulatory procedures, called [[Chief compliance officer|compliance officer]]s, may realize that certain dubious transactions, such as [[money laundering]] and [[terrorist financing]], will occur regardless of any regulatory restrictions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Economist]] |url= http://economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5053373 |title=Financing terrorism: Looking in the wrong places |date=October 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; still, to protect themselves and their banks against possible future sanctions, they may engage in CYA activity such as issuing unnecessary memos, obfuscating documents or conducting transactions discreetly, as ways to absolve themselves from possible future liability. The term is widely used in [[journalism]]. Safire explained how the term is used in [[bureaucracy]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Safire |title=Safire's Political Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2008 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=c4UoX6-Sv1AC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=%22CYA%22+%22william+safire%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V2wn_vtyFq&amp;sig=4jJUXANwOshQQfUMqkVRS4UJ1Vg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-3f8U8qkFtO4ogThw4HYCQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22CYA%22%20%22william%20safire%22&amp;f=false |chapter=C.Y.A. |access-date=August 26, 2014 |page=164 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|A bureaucrat adept at ''C.Y.A.'' (a) likes to employ passive constructions (see ''[[mistakes were made]]''), (b) follows up a meeting or phone call with a self-serving ''memcon''—"[[memorandum of conversation]]", (c) routes memos to and through as many other bureaucrats as possible, thereby spreading the risk of future criticism, and (d) "papers the file" with memoranda sometimes supporting and sometimes contradicting his or her position.}}

Because these practices are so routine, a genuine warning can be mistaken for CYA behavior, causing a [[Type I and type II errors#Type II error|type II error]] or [[False positives and false negatives#False negative error|false-negative error]], with disastrous results. For example, in the summer preceding the [[September 11 attacks|attacks of 9/11]], U.S. president [[George W. Bush]] was briefed on a now-famous August 6, 2001, memo titled ''[[Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US]]''. Bush's response to the briefer was reportedly: "All right. You've covered your ass, now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Barton |last=Gellman |date=June 20, 2006 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/19/AR2006061901211.html |title=The Shadow War, In a Surprising New Light |access-date=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another example, before the launch of the United States spaceship Challenger which ended tragically with the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]], the final launch approval by rocket maker [[Morton Thiokol]] contained the phrase "information on this page was prepared to support an oral presentation and cannot be considered complete without the oral discussion"; this notice was later described as a "CYA notice" by information design specialist [[Edward Tufte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward R. |last=Tufte |author-link=Edward R. Tufte |title=Visual Explanations |publisher=Graphics Press |date=1997 |pages=26–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In print, it can have the form of a [[disclaimer]]; for example, ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine suggested that the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House]] used the phrase "It is important not to read too much into any one monthly report" as a disclaimer on reports, and this was described as a CYA activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Weigel |date=September 6, 2012 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |url= http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/07/06/the_white_house_uses_the_exact_same_cya_sentence_in_every_jobs_report.html |title=The White House Uses the Exact Same CYA Sentence in Every Jobs Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been applied in the medical profession to describe doctors who prescribe unnecessary medical tests for patients, to protect themselves against possible future lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Megan |last=McArdle |date=February 8, 2010 |work=The Atlantic |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/02/the-reality-of-health-care-plans/35533/ |title=The Reality of Health Care Plans |access-date=August 26, 2014 |quote=... we could eliminate a hell of a lot of unnecessary day to day expenses ... visits of convenience and CYA tests for diseases there's no indication the patient has ....}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used to describe a cultural tendency which works against accountability and risk-taking, such as in a war effort when generals engage in much ''cover your ass'' activity which avoids taking real responsibility.&lt;ref name=twsAtlantic&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas E. |last=Ricks |date=October 24, 2012 |work=The Atlantic |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/11/general-failure/309148/ |title=General Failure |access-date=August 26, 2014 |quote=... appropriate risk-taking diminished (the art of combat pursuit was almost lost in Vietnam), and a 'cover your ass' mentality took hold ....}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Data Act''' (Sw. ''Datalagen'') is the world's first national data protection law and was enacted in [[Sweden]] on 11 May 1973.&lt;ref name=impl/&gt;&lt;ref name=reg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Privacy Law: Sweden|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/online-privacy-law/sweden.php|website=www.loc.gov|publisher=Law Library of Congress|accessdate=10 May 2017|language=en|date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It went into effect on 1 July 1974&lt;ref name=dp&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mochmann|first1=Ekkehard|last2=Müller|first2=Paul J.|title=Data Protection and Social Science Research: Perspectives from Ten Countries|publisher=Ardent Media|isbn=9783593326047|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=6iR3BBut7Z8C&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=10 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reg/&gt; and required licenses by the [[Swedish Data Protection Authority]]&lt;!--same as Data Inspection Board?--&gt; for information systems handling [[personal data]].&lt;ref name=h2/&gt;

==History==
[[Information and communications technologies]] (ICTs) were far developed in Sweden due to multiple &lt;!--societal--&gt;circumstances and the use of computers in public administration was introduced relatively early. Furthermore, the concepts of [[open government|transparency]], [[Freedom of information laws by country|public access]] and [[openness]] were traditionally widely present in Swedish society.&lt;ref name=con/&gt;&lt;ref name=emerg/&gt; Widespread public concern was raised in 1969 due to the year's public census.&lt;ref name=emerg/&gt;

In 1969 the Royal Commission on Publicity and Secrecy was set up to investigate problems associated with the increasing use of computers to store and process personal data&lt;ref name="dp"/&gt; and provided the initial analysis, recommendations and drafts.&lt;ref name=reg/&gt; In July 1972 it published its report ''Computers and Privacy'' (Sw. ''Data och integritet'').&lt;ref name=reg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=Colin J.|title=Regulating Privacy: Data Protection and Public Policy in Europe and the United States|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801480108|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=D17pcdORb9UC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=10 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Data Inspection Board (DIB), proposed in the report, was set up in July 1973.&lt;ref name=reg/&gt;

In April 1973 the [[Riksdag]] uncontentiously passed the Data Act, also proposed in the report, which only slightly modified the commission's draft.&lt;ref name=reg/&gt; It then came into force in July 1973.&lt;ref name=reg/&gt; An associated amendment to the Freedom of the Press Act was adopted in February 1974 − around the same time as the Credit Information Act and the Debt Recovery Acts which regulated computerized credit information.&lt;ref name=reg/&gt;

===Problems and succession===&lt;!--rename section?--&gt;
As the law's data registration and transborder data flow requirements were considered cumbersome and confusing by private and public organizations and the DIB was soon overcome by the magnitude of registrations the law was amended in 1982 which made the private sector and the government more self-sufficient in terms of registration.&lt;ref name=h1/&gt;

After several more amendments&lt;!--covering particular computerised personal data registers held by authorities [all of those?]--&gt; in 1989 a Commission on Data Protection was set up to make a total revision of the act. The commission submitted its final report in 1993 recommending a new Data Protection Act based largely on the then current second proposal from the European Commission for an EC Directive. In  1995 Sweden joined the European Union which had adopted the [[Data Protection Directive]] in the same year and a new committee was entrusted with making recommendations on the implementation of the directive and a new total revision of the Data Act. In 1997 it presented a report on the implementation containing a proposal for a new Personal Data Act.&lt;ref name=impl/&gt;

The law was then superseded on 24 October 1998 by the Personal Data Act (Sw. ''Personuppgiftslagen'') that implemented the 1995 EU directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law in Sweden - DLA Piper Global Data Protection Laws of the World|url=https://www.dlapiperdataprotection.com/index.html?t=law&amp;c=SE|website=www.dlapiperdataprotection.com|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Data Act (1998:204);|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/documents/sweden%20personal%20data%20act-eng.pdf|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Personal Data Act - Datainspektionen|url=http://www.datainspektionen.se/in-english/legislation/the-personal-data-act/|website=www.datainspektionen.se|accessdate=10 May 2017|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Castro|first1=Catarina|title=Employment Privacy Law in the European Union: Surveillance and Monitoring|publisher=Intersentia nv|isbn=9789050952392|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=iaDofM_GTWMC&amp;pg=PA249|accessdate=10 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1973 law mainly focused on automated computer processing systems containing assignable information of living&lt;ref name=dp/&gt; persons&lt;ref name=reg/&gt; and not data processing in general and was considered to be outdated in many respects for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal  Data Protection|url=http://www.regeringen.se/contentassets/87382a7887764e9995db186244b557e4/personal-data-protection|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirchberger|first1=Christine|title=Cyber Law in Sweden|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=9789041134523|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=pfkM46iA7q4C&amp;pg=PA193|accessdate=10 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Protection Laws of the World Handbook: Second Edition - Sweden - Data Protection - Sweden|url=http://www.mondaq.com/x/231636/data+protection/Data+Protection+Laws+of+the+World+Handbook+Second+Edition+Sweden|website=www.mondaq.com|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The law==
The act required a prior permit from the DIB for each computerised personal data register. When a permit was given, the Board issued tailor-made conditions for that register. It did not contain many provisions on when and how the data should be processed, or general data protection principles.&lt;ref name=impl&gt;{{cite web|last1=Öman|first1=Sören|title=Implementing Data Protection in Law|url=http://www.scandinavianlaw.se/pdf/47-18.pdf|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who were subject of data contents were guaranteed freedom of access to their records. Exporting data on Swedish citizens outside the country required a license as well which wasn't granted when it was discovered that this was done to evade the regulatory requirements of the law.&lt;ref name=h1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madsen|first1=Wayne|title=Handbook of Personal Data Protection|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781349128068|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=BruxCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=10 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=emerg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fuster|first1=Gloria González|title=The Emergence of Personal Data Protection as a Fundamental Right of the EU|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business|isbn=9783319050232|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=iqnBBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=10 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 the Swedish government issued a report which also raised concerns over critical data exported to other countries potentially becoming a target of terrorist organizations.&lt;ref name=h1/&gt;

It also requires responsible persons to pay compensations when individuals suffer damage due to incorrect information about them.&lt;ref name=reg/&gt;

The law also criminalized data intrusion but only intended to penalize persons physically breaking into offices to change data and did not consider Internet-based hacking at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirchberger|first1=Christine|title=Cyber Law in Sweden|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=9789041134523|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=pfkM46iA7q4C&amp;pg=PA221|accessdate=10 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20404">'''Demai''' ({{lang-he|דְּמַאי}}, meaning "agricultural produce about which there is a doubt whether it has been properly tithed" is the third [[Masekhet|tractate]] of ''[[Zeraim|Seder Zeraim]]'' ("Order of Seeds") of the [[Mishnah]] and of the [[Talmud]]. It deals with the [[Halakha|Jewish legal]] concept of ''demai'', doubtfully tithed produce, and concerns the laws related to agricultural produce about which it is suspected that certain obligatory tithes have not been properly separated in accordance with requirements specified in the [[Torah]]. The tithes in question are ''[[First tithe|ma'aser rishon]]'' (the first tithe, for the [[Levite]]), ''[[Terumat hamaaser|terumath ma'aser]]'' (the Levite's tithe to the [[Kohen|kohen]]), and ''[[Second tithe|ma'aser sheni]]'' (the second tithe, for the owner to consume in Jerusalem) or ''[[Poor tithe|ma'aser ani]]'' (the tithe for the poor), depending on the year of the [[Shmita|Sabbatical year cycle]].

The tractate consists of seven chapters and has a [[Gemara]] only in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. There is a [[Tosefta]] of eight chapters for this tractate.

==Etymology==
The [[etymology]] of the word "demai" is uncertain, and it seems that the rabbis of the Talmud were unclear about it. The [[Amoraim]] of the second generation (250–290 C.E.) seem to derive it from an [[Aramaic]] question meaning "whether?" signifying "is this tithed or not?" The Jerusalem Talmud connects it to the root ''d-m-y'', in the sense of "perhaps" as in "perhaps he prepared it [the tithe], perhaps he did not prepare it." It is possibly a linguistic parallel to the opposite term, ''vadai'', "certain."&lt;ref name=EJ&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Gilat|first=Yitzhak Dov|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Judaica |volume=5|page=1486–1487|title=Demai|year=1978 |edition=1st |publisher=Keter Publishing House Ltd. |location=Jerusalem, Israel }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Soncino&gt;{{cite book |last1=Segal |first1=M.H.|editor1-first=I. |editor1-last=Epstein |editor1-link=Isadore Epstein |others= |title=The Talmud|type= |volume= Zeraim vol. II |year=1948 |publisher=The Soncino Press |location=London |language= |isbn= 9789562913447 |pages=49–52|chapter=Demai: Translated into English with Notes |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other explanations, cited by [[Nathan ben Jehiel]], the author of the Talmudic lexicon, [[Nathan_ben_Jehiel#The_Arukh|the Arukh]] (11th century C.E.) also derive the meaning from Aramaic expressions, such as ''din ma'i'' or ''da ma'i'', meaning "what is this the law" or "what is this?" in reference to the produce that is subject to tithing.&lt;ref name=Soncino/&gt; 

[[Benjamin Musaphia]], the annotator of the Arukh (17th century C.E.) understands that the word originates from the Greek word ''demos'', people, meaning produce of the ''am ha-aretz'', the ordinary "people of the land" about whom there was doubt whether all were sufficiently knowledgeable or careful about observing the laws concerning tithes.&lt;ref name=Soncino/&gt;

==Subject matter ==
{{see also|Tithes in Judaism}}

This tractate concerns the laws regarding agricultural produce about which there is a doubt as to whether the rules relating to the tithes were strictly observed. This doubtfully tithed produce is known as ''demai''.&lt;ref name=Birnbaum144&gt;{{cite book|title=A Book of Jewish Concepts|last=Birnbaum|first=Philip |chapter=Demai|year=1975|publisher=Hebrew Publishing Company|location=New York, NY|isbn=088482876X|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The background to the discussions of this tractate is that according to the [[Torah]], [[Israelites|Israelite]] farmers were obligated to separate three types of tithes: 
* ''[[First tithe|Ma'aser rishon]]'' – the first tithe, which had to be given to [[Levite|Levites]], who had not been given an allotment of tribal land and therefore depended on this produce for their sustenance ({{bibleverse|Num|18:21|HE}}) 
* ''[[Second tithe|Ma'aser sheni]]'' – the second tithe, which the owner had to consume in [[Jerusalem]], or convert into money plus a fifth of its value and reconvert into food in Jerusalem ({{Bibleverse||Deut|14:22-27|HE}}) 
* ''[[Poor tithe|Ma'aser ani]]'' – poor person's tithe, in place of the second tithe in the third and sixth year of the seven-year cycle in the [[Shmita|sabbatical year]] ({{bibleverse||Deut.|14:22-29|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Deut.|26:12-15|HE}}).&lt;ref name=Soncino/&gt;&lt;ref name=Birnbaum382&gt;{{cite book|title=A Book of Jewish Concepts|last=Birnbaum|first=Philip |chapter=Tithes|year=1975|publisher=Hebrew Publishing Company|location=New York, NY|isbn=088482876X|page=382–383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Levites also had to contribute from the tithe that they received from the Israelites to the kohanim, consisting of a tenth part of the tithe they had received; it was called ''[[Terumat hamaaser|terumath ma'aser]]'' (offering from the tithe) or ''ma'aser min ha-ma'aser'' (tithe from the tithe) ({{bibleverse|Num|18:26|HE}}).&lt;ref name=Soncino/&gt;&lt;ref name=Birnbaum382/&gt;

During the [[Second Temple period|period of the Second Temple]], doubt began to arise among scrupulous observers of the law (known as ''haverim'') as to whether produce had been properly tithed when they bought from farmers who were likely to be uneducated, or unscrupulous about separating the tithes. This type of individual was known as an ''am ha'aretz'' (person of the land), someone whose trustworthiness was questionable.&lt;ref name=EJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=Birnbaum144/&gt; 

The ''am ha'aretz'' was not suspected of not giving ''[[Heave offering|terumah]]'' (gifts to the priests), because it required only a small payment comprising one-hundredth of the produce, and because ''terumah'' had a degree of sanctity that made it a severe transgression for a non-priest to eat.&lt;ref name=Birnbaum144/&gt; 

However, because it was doubtful whether the produce of the ''am ha'aretz'' had been tithed, the ''haverim'' who bought grain from them had to designate part of the produce as ''ma'aser'' (a tithe for the Levites or the poor) and ''ma'aser min ha-ma'aser'' (a tenth part of that tithe), albeit in a way that reduced financial loss.&lt;ref name=Birnbaum144/&gt;&lt;ref name=JE&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia |inline=1 |wstitle=Demai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of general note in this tractate are disputes between the [[House of Shammai|Houses of Shammai]] and [[House of Hillel|Hillel]], the [[Yavne#Significance for Judaism|sages from Yavne]], as well as material from the generation of [[Usha (city)|Usha]] contained in this tractate.&lt;ref name=EJ/&gt;

One of the earliest uses of the concept of "[[monopoly]]" in a commercial sense appears in this tractate, regarding the purchasing of agricultural goods from a dealer who has a monopoly on the produce (chapter 5; 4).&lt;ref name=Soncino69&gt;{{cite book |last1=Segal |first1=M.H.|editor1-first=I. |editor1-last=Epstein |editor1-link=Isadore Epstein |others= |title=The Talmud|type= |volume= Zeraim vol. II |year=1948 |publisher=The Soncino Press |location=London |language= |isbn= 9789562913447 |pages=69|quote=Rabbi Judah agrees that if a man bought from a monopolist, he must tithe every heap|chapter=Demai: Translated into English with Notes |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gemara contains a few passages of [[Aggadah]]. For example, the conscientiousness of Rabbi [[Phinehas ben Jair]] regarding the laws of tithes is described along with other [[Phinehas ben Jair#His piety|acts of piety]] for which he was well-known.&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;

==Structure==
The tractate consists of seven chapters and 53 paragraphs (''mishnayot''). It has a [[Gemara]] – rabbinical analysis of and commentary on the Mishnah – only in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]; it also has [[Tosefta]].&lt;ref name=EJ/&gt;

There is no Gemara in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] for this tractate or indeed for any of the tractates of [[Seder Zeraim|this order of the Mishna]], other than tractate [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]], as the laws related to agriculture that they discuss generally have no practical application outside of the Land of Israel.&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;

Demai, with its seven chapters, is an exception to the usual pattern of arranging the tractates in order according to the numbers of their chapters; it appears third in the Mishnah and Jerusalem Talmud, and in most manuscripts of the Tosefta, before tractates with more chapters.&lt;ref name=EJ/&gt;

The Tosefta has a few modifications and additions. It divides Chapter 2 of the Mishna into two parts, and thus has eight chapters instead of the seven of the Mishnah. The eighth paragraph of the sixth chapter of the Mishnah corresponds to the beginning of the eighth chapter of the Tosefta.&lt;ref name=JE&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia |inline=1 |wstitle=Demai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An overview of the topics of the chapters is as follows:

'''Chapter 1''' details the cases of products that are exempt from the rules of ''demai'' such as fruit or vegetables which are ''hefker'' (unclaimed or ownerless property).&lt;ref name=Soncino/&gt;&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;

'''Chapter 2''' lists the products to which the rules of ''demai'' apply even outside the Land of Israel if it is bought from an ''am ha’aretz''; discusses how a person may be certified as a ''ne'eman'' (one who is deemed trustworthy with respect to tithing), or as a ''ḥaver'' who is also trusted on matters of purity; and the duty of merchants regarding tithing ''demai'' produce.&lt;ref name=EJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=Soncino/&gt;&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;

'''Chapter 3''' considers the rules for giving or leaving ''demai'' for other people to use and specifies that a ''haver'' must not cause others to consume ''demai''.&lt;ref name=Soncino/&gt;&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;

'''Chapter 4''' considers the rules of eating ''demai'' produce with people who are not trustworthy, and when buying it from them is allowed.&lt;ref name=Soncino/&gt;&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;

'''Chapter 5''' examines the rules about tithing ''demai'' produce bought from several people, and about tithing produce of one kind for produce of another kind.&lt;ref name=Soncino/&gt;&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;

'''Chapter 6''' examines the rules of tithing produce of rented or leased land or trees, of tithing the produce of partners and heirs, of produce sold in lands bordering the Land of Israel, and of produce bought for an ''am ha'aretz''.&lt;ref name=Soncino/&gt;&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;

'''Chapter 7''' considers the rules for the tithing of food consumed with an am ''ha'aretz'', rules of tithing by 'designation', and the rules concerning mixtures and regulations for the tithing of ''demai'' on urgent occasions.&lt;ref name=Soncino/&gt;&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;

==Commentaries==
Commentaries on this tractate include the following:

The '''''Rash Sirilio''''' is the earliest known comprehensive commentary on a large portion of the Jerusalem Talmud is that of Rabbi [[Solomon Sirilio|Shlomo Sirilio]] (1485–1558). In the [[Vilna Edition Shas|Vilna edition]] of the Jerusalem Talmud it appears only for tractates [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]] and [[Pe'ah]] but the commentary for the entire Seder Zeraim, including tractate Demai, appears in the Mutzal Mi'Eish edition of the Jerusalem Talmud. In addition to his commentary, Rash Sirilio worked to remove mistakes made by manuscript copyists that over time had slipped into the text of the Jerusalem Talmud and his amended text of the Gemara is reproduced alongside his commentary in the Vilna and Mutzal Mi'Eish editions of the Jerusalem Talmud. 

'''''Mahara Fulda''''' and its companion, '''''Tosefot Maharaf''''', are the commentaries of Rabbi [[Elijah of Fulda|Eliyahu of Fulda]], published in [[Amsterdam]] in 1710. Many later commentators refer to him only as ''HaMefareish'' (''The Commentator''). 

'''''Pnei Moshe''''', the only commentary that covers all of the Jerusalem Talmud completely was written by Rabbi [[Moses Margolies|Moshe Margolies]], where it was first published in Amsterdam in 1775. 

The [[Vilna Gaon|Gaon, Rabbi Eliyahu of Vilna]] also worked to correct many of the textual errors in the text of the Jerusalem Talmud and his rectifications are contained in marginal glosses published under the title '''''Hagahot HaGra'''''. In addition, a work known as '''''Beurei HaGra''''', was written by his disciples based on his comments. Two versions of this commentary exist, based on manuscripts written by different disciples. 

A commentary known as the '''''Ridvaz''''' on nearly all the tractates of the Jerusalem Talmud was first published in [[Piotrków Trybunalski|Piotrków ]] in 1898, with its companion commentary, '''''Tosefot HaRid''''', by Rabbi [[Yaakov Dovid Wilovsky]] of [[Slutzk]] and later of [[Safed]] (1845–1914). 

In modern times, two comprehensive works have been published:
 
'''''Toldot Yitzchak''''' and its companion '''''Tevunah''''', by Rabbi [[Yitzchok Isaac Krasilschikov]] of [[Poltava]], who wrote his commentary in the Soviet Union before he died in Moscow in 1965. The manuscript was smuggled out of Communist Russia by Rabbi Harry Bronstein, who founded Machon Mutzal MeiEish and published a new edition of Seder Zeraim of the Jerusalem Talmud, which included Rabbi Krasilschikov's work and all the major commentators published up to that time. 

'''''Sha'arei Emunoh''''', the commentary of Rabbi [[Chaim Kanievsky]] to the Jerusalem Talmud has been published to date on Sedarim Zeraim and Moed. It is based on lectures given by Rabbi Kanievsky and contains explanations from earlier commentators, as well as many original insights; the volume on Demai was published in [[Bnei Brak]], Israel, in 2002. 

In addition to the commentaries listed to the above, commentaries specific to tractate Demai, or to the laws of demai are the following:

'''''Kaftor VaFerach''''', by Rabbi [[Ishtori Haparchi]], a disciple of the Rosh, is one of the few surviving compositions of the Rishonim concerning Seder Zeraim. Rabbi Ishtori was born in [[History of the Jews in France#Provence|Provence]] in about 1280 and emigrated to the [[Land of Israel]], where he absorbed himself in the study of the [[Laws and customs of the Land of Israel in Judaism|halachot applying to the Land]]. His work was first published in [[History of the Jews in Venice|Venice]] in 1546. 

'''''Maharam Chaviv''''' by Rabbi Moshe ibn Chaviv of [[History of the Jews in Thessaloniki|Salonika]] (17th century) wrote a commentary to the Jerusalem Talmud's tractate Demai, as well as to the Jerusalem Talmud's tractates Berakhot and Peah. This commentary was also named Pnei Moshe, but to distinguish it from the more well-known commentary of that name by Moshe Margolies, it is sometimes referred to as Maharam Chaviv. Extant only as a manuscript from the time of its composition, it was first published by Machon Yerushalayim in 1994. 

'''''Pe'at HaShulchan''''' is a work on the laws pertaining to agriculture, written by Rabbi [[Yisroel ben Shmuel of Shklov]] (1770–1839), a disciple of the Vilna Gaon and first published in Safed in 1836. It contains two sections, the basic laws, which are mostly adopted from [[Maimonides]], and a section of broader discussion called ''Beis Yisrael''. 

'''''Aruch Ha'Shulchan He'Atid''''' is a compendium of halachot written by Rabbi [[Yechiel Michel Epstein]] of [[Navahrudak|Novaradok]] (1829–1902), who also composed the standard [[Aruch HaShulchan]]. It was published posthumously in Jerusalem in 1938 and the first volume deals with the laws of Seder Zeraim. 

'''''Torat HaAretz''''' is a work on the agricultural laws, authored by Rabbi Moshe Kliers of [[Tiberias]], published in Jerusalem in 1928 (with a second edition published in 1972). 

'''''Mikdash David''''' is the work of Rabbi David HaKohen Rappaport (1890–1942), a Torah scholar who perished in [[the Holocaust]] and whose work contains a section pertaining to Seder Zeraim. 

'''''Chazon Ish''''' is a wide-ranging work by Rabbi [[Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz]] covering a good part of the Mishnah and Talmud. Chazon Ish's writings on Seder Zeraim in particular have been influential in establishing contemporary halachah in Israel regarding agricultural matters. Chazon Ish's work on Seder Zeraim, including a section on Demai, was originally published in [[Bnei Brak]] in 1958. 

'''''Chidushim U'Veurim''''' of Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] is an extensive work on the Jerusalem Talmud's tractate Demai and is published in the Machon Mutzal MeiEish edition of the Jerusalem Talmud. 

'''''Eretz HaBechirah''''' is a multi-volume work on Seder Zeraim by Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Weiner of Jerusalem; the volume on tractate Demai was published in Jerusalem in 1998. 

'''''Emunas Eliezer''''' is a commentary on the Mishna of tractate Demai by Rabbi Eliezer Ephraim Sherwinter, published in Fallsburg, NY in 2007. 

'''''Mishnas Avraham''''' is a work on various tractates in Seder Zeraim by Rabbi Avraham HaLevi Stewart; the volume on Demai was published in Jerusalem in 2007. 

'''''Birkat Yisrael''''' by Rabbi Yisrael Moshe Fried, in collaboration with others, was published in Jerusalem in 2008 as part of a volume containing a critical edition of the Jerusalem Talmud's tractate Demai with commentaries. In addition to its original comments, ''Birkat Yisrael'' cites many earlier works. 

'''''Kav VeNaki''''' is a commentary as well as a section of insights to tractate Demai co-authored by Rabbi Yehudah Levi and Rabbi Gershon Metzger, published in Jerusalem in 2005. 

Works that are of assistance interpreting the many botanical references in tractate Demai include the following: 

* {{cite book|last1=Feliks|first1=Yehudah|title=HaTzome'ach Ve'Ha'Chai Ba'Mishnah|date=1983|location=Jerusalem, Israel|language=Hebrew|quote=(Flora and Fauna in the Mishna)}}

*{{cite book|last1=Oelbaum|first1=Chaim Tzvi|title=Mesorot HaZihuy Shel Tzimchei Mishnat Kilayim|date=2008|publisher=Bar Ilan University|location=Ramat Gan, Israel}} (monograph which identifies the plant names mentioned in the commentaries of the Rishonim). 

*{{cite book|last1=Amar|first1=Zohar|title=Machberet Tzimchei HaMishnah shel Rabbi Yosef Kafich|publisher=Bar Ilan University|language=Hebrew|quote=Notes on Plants of the Mishnah of Rabbi Yosef Kafich}} (Rabbi Yosef Kafich in his notes to Rambam's Commentary in Arabic identifies numerous species by their Latin equivalents)

==Historical context==

A rabbinic tradition (cited in [[Sotah (Talmud)|Mishnah Sotah]], Tosefta Sotah, and the Jerusalem Talmud in Sotah and [[Ma'aser Sheni]]) indicates that the institution of ''demai'' was in force at the time of the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean]] [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] [[John Hyrcanus|Yohanan Hyrcanus]] (135–104 B.C.E.). On the other hand, a ''[[Baraita]]'' in the Babylonian Talmud (Sotah 48a), describes Yohanan as the person who instituted ''demai'' upon discovering that most people only separated the priestly ''terumah'' offering and neglected the tithes.&lt;ref name=EJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;

The contents of this tractate mostly reflect conditions in [[Judea]] and [[Galilee#Ancient and classic antiquity|the Galilee]] during the second century C.E. and particularly the conditions in the Galilee after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] (132–136 C.E.). Most of the [[Tannaim]] whose opinions are recorded in this tractate are from this period.&lt;ref name=Soncino/&gt; 

The tractate contains data about the social life and institutions of the time and the social and commercial relations between the various segments of the population, such as the ''chaver'', the ''am haaretz'', employers and workers, and innkeepers and their guests. The Gemara in the Jerusalem Talmud indicates that there were inspectors who distinguished between produce that was properly tithed (''metukan'') and the ''demai'', and that there were also officers appointed to watch the sale of articles of food and keep the prices low.&lt;ref name=Soncino/&gt;&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;

The Gemara also has considerable information about the produce of the [[Land of Israel]]. Many names of fruits and vegetables, in addition to those mentioned in the Mishnah, are cited in the Gemara, along with information about the markets and names of places inside and outside the Land of Israel.&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;

'''Epistemic democracy''' is the "doctrine of the wisdom of the multitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waldron|first1=Jeremy|authorlink=Jeremy Waldron|title=The Wisdom of the Multitude: Some Reflections on Book 3, Chapter 11 of Aristotle's Politics|journal=Political Theory|date=1995|volume=23|issue=4|pages=563–584|doi=10.1177/0090591795023004001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition and etymology ==

Epistemic democracy is:
{{quote|a recent paradigm in democratic theory. Put generally, in the epistemic interpretation, democratic decision-making processes are valued at least in part for their knowledge-producing potential and defended in relation to this. Epistemic democracy further combines deliberative and aggregative approaches to democracy but shifts their focus towards an outcome-oriented consideration for how well democratic procedures such as deliberation and voting help democratic decisions approximate a procedure-independent standard of correctness (Cohen 1986).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uio.no/english/research/interfaculty-research-areas/democracy/news-and-events/events/seminars/2011/oslo-yale-int-workshop.html Workshop on Epistemic Democracy in Practice]. Retrieved April-27-2016&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Contemporary conceptual discussions ==

=== Diversity ===

=== Independent standard v. proceduralism ===

Christian List and [[Robert Goodin]], for example, maintain that “for epistemic democrats, the aim of democracy is to ‘track the truth.’” For them, democracy is more desirable than alternative forms of decision-making because, and insofar as, it does that. One democratic decision rule is more desirable than another according to that same standard.” In contrast, “procedural democrats” hold that the “aim of democracy is to embody certain procedural virtues…. Democracy is not about tracking any ‘independent truth of the matter’; instead, the goodness or rightness of an outcome is wholly constituted by the fact of its having emerged in some procedurally correct manner” such as through voting or deliberation. Fabienne Peter, for example, offers a conception of epistemic proceduralism that does not depend on a procedure-independent standard for a good outcome. Instead, a decision is legitimate “if it is the outcome of a process that satisfies certain conditions of political and epistemic fairness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=List|first1=Christian|last2=Goodin|first2=Robert|authorlink2=Robert Goodin|title=Epistemic Democracy: Generalizing the Condorcet Jury Theorem|url=http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/users/list/listgoodin.pdf|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[David Estlund]] argues that we do not even need a strong justification of “epistemic proceduralism.” Rather, all that is needed is to show why it is better than the alternatives. Estlund argues that pure epistocracies are problematic because there is most likely a “biasing features of the educated group… which do more harm than education does good.” In the US this can be seen in the income and racial inequality that leads to imperfect meritocratic systems that produces those with greater money with the highest education. Estlund uses the case of [[jury]] systems to show that original authority can be drawn from an epistemic proceduralist account grounded in normative consent. For him, democracy has no normative [[authority]] unless it has a minimal epistemic threshold, which he sets at “better than random” (as in majority rule, better than just 51% of the vote).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Estlund|first1=David|authorlink=David Estlund|title=Democratic Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Federal Register''''' ('''FR''' or sometimes '''Fed. Reg.''') is the [[government gazette|official journal]] of the [[federal government of the United States]] that contains government agency rules, proposed rules, and public notices.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|44|1505}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is published daily, except on [[Federal holidays in the United States|federal holidays]]. The final rules promulgated by a federal agency and published in the ''Federal Register'' are ultimately reorganized by topic or subject matter and [[Codification (law)|codified]] in the ''[[Code of Federal Regulations]]'' (CFR), which is updated annually.

The ''Federal Register'' is compiled by the [[Office of the Federal Register]] (within the [[National Archives and Records Administration]]) and is printed by the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Publishing Office]]. There are no [[copyright]] restrictions on the ''Federal Register''; as a [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government|work of the U.S. government]], it is in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|1|2|6}}; "Any person may reproduce or republish, without restriction, any material appearing in any regular or special edition of the Federal Register."&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Contents==
The ''Federal Register'' provides a means for the government to announce to the public changes to government requirements, policies, and guidance. 
* Proposed new rules and [[regulation]]s
* Final rules
* Changes to existing rules
* Notices of meetings and adjudicatory proceedings
* Presidential documents including [[Executive order]]s, proclamations and administrative orders.

Both proposed and final government rules are published in the ''Federal Register''.  A [[Notice of Proposed Rulemaking]] (or "NPRM") typically requests public comment on a proposed rule and provides notice of any public meetings where a proposed rule will be discussed. The public comments are considered by the issuing [[government agencies|government agency]], and the text of a final rule along with a discussion of the comments is published in the ''Federal Register''. Any agency proposing a rule in the ''Federal Register'' must provide contact information for people and organizations interested in making comments to the agencies and the agencies are required to address these concerns when it publishes its final rule on the subject.

The notice and comment process, as outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act, gives the people a chance to participate in agency [[rulemaking]]. Publication of documents in the ''Federal Register'' also constitutes [[constructive notice]], and its contents are [[judicial notice|judicially noticed]].{{sfn|Kohlmetz|1948|p=58}}

The ''[[United States Government Manual]]'' is published as a special edition of the ''Federal Register''. Its focus is on programs and activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|1|9|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format ==
Each daily issue of the printed ''Federal Register'' is organized into four categories:

* Presidential Documents ([[executive order]]s and [[presidential proclamation|proclamations]])
* Rules and Regulations (including policy statements and interpretations of rules by federal agencies)
* Proposed Rules (including petitions to agencies from the public)
* Notices (such as scheduled hearings and meetings open to the public and grant applications)

Citations from the ''Federal Register'' are [volume] FR [page number] ([date]), ''e.g.'', 71 FR 24924 (Apr. 7, 2006).

The final rules promulgated by a federal agency and published in the ''Federal Register'' are ultimately reorganized by topic or subject matter and re-published (or "codified") in the ''[[Code of Federal Regulations]]'' (CFR), which is updated annually.

== Availability ==
Copies of the ''Federal Register'' may be obtained from the U.S. Government Publishing Office. Most [[law library|law libraries]] associated with an [[American Bar Association]]–accredited law school will also have a set, as will [[Federal depository library|federal depository libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.gpo.gov/fdlpdir/FDLPdir.jsp|title=FDLP Library Directory|work=Catalog of U.S. Government Publications|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509072008/http://catalog.gpo.gov/fdlpdir/FDLPdir.jsp|archivedate=2009-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free sources ===
The ''Federal Register'' has been available online since 1994. [[Federal Depository Library Program|Federal depository libraries]] within the U.S. also receive copies of the text, either in [[paper]] or [[microfiche]] format. Outside the U.S., some major libraries may also carry the ''Federal Register''.

As part of the Federal E-Government eRulemaking Initiative, the web site [[Regulations.gov]] was established in 2003 to enable easy public access to agency dockets on rulemaking projects including the published ''Federal Register'' document. The public can use Regulations.gov to access entire rulemaking dockets from participating Federal agencies to include providing on-line comments directly to those responsible for drafting the rulemakings. To help federal agencies manage their dockets, the [[Federal Docket Management System]] (FDMS) was launched in 2005 and is the agency side of regulations.gov.

In April 2009, [[Citation Technologies]] created a free, searchable website for ''Federal Register'' articles dating from 1996 to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalregister.com|title=Federal Register – Rules, notices, proposed rules|work=FederalRegister.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102095859/http://federalregister.com/|archivedate=2010-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ''Federal Register'' system of publication was created on July 26, 1935, under the [[Federal Register Act]].{{sfn|Kohlmetz|1948|p=58}}&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|74|220|49|500|1935|07|26}}. {{Usc-title-chap|44|15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of the ''Federal Register'' was published on March 16, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/the-federal-register/history.pdf|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|title=A Brief History Commemorating the 70th Anniversary of the Publication of the First Issue of the Federal Register March 14, 1936|accessdate=13 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611100009/http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/the-federal-register/history.pdf|archivedate=11 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946 the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] required agencies to publish more information related to their rulemaking documents in the ''Federal Register''.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|5|551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2014, Rep. [[Darrell Issa]] introduced the [[Federal Register Modernization Act]] (H.R. 4195), a bill that would require the ''Federal Register'' to be published (e.g., by electronic means), rather than printed, and that documents in the ''Federal Register'' be made available for sale or distribution to the public in published form.&lt;ref name=4195sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4195 – Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4195|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=14 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715042423/https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4195|archivedate=15 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Association of Law Libraries]] (AALL) strongly opposed the bill, arguing that the bill undermines citizens' right to be informed by making it more difficult for citizens to find their government's regulations.&lt;ref name=AALLoppose&gt;{{cite web|title=The Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations|url=http://aallnet.org/Documents/Government-Relations/Issue-Briefs-and-Reports/2014/FRonepager.pdf|publisher=American Association of Law Libraries|accessdate=14 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715020300/http://aallnet.org/Documents/Government-Relations/Issue-Briefs-and-Reports/2014/FRonepager.pdf|archivedate=15 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to AALL, a survey they conducted "revealed that members of the public, librarians, researchers, students, attorneys, and small business owners continue to rely on the print" version of the ''Federal Register''.&lt;ref name="AALLoppose"/&gt; AALL also argued that the lack of print versions of the ''Federal Register'' and ''CFR'' would mean the 15 percent of Americans who don't use the internet would lose their access to that material.&lt;ref name="AALLoppose"/&gt; The House voted on July 14, 2014 to pass the bill 386-0.&lt;ref name=FTbillpassage&gt;{{cite news|last1=Medici|first1=Andy|title=House passes bills to change TSP default fund, extend whistleblower protections|url=http://www.federaltimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2014307150016|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140726053819/http://www.federaltimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2014307150016|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 July 2014|accessdate=21 July 2014|publisher=Federal Times|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=4195allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4195 – All Actions|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4195/all-actions|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=14 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727225422/https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4195/all-actions|archivedate=27 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Florida Sheriffs Association''' (FSA) is a [[non-profit]] [[professional association]] of [[Florida|Florida’s]] 67 elected [[Sheriff]]s, along with approximately 3,500 business leaders and 70,000 citizens throughout the state. The FSA’s mission is to enhance law enforcement through educational and charitable purposes within the state of Florida.

==History==
In 1893, Duval County Sheriff [[Napoleon B. Broward]], who later served as governor of Florida, helped organize the Florida Sheriffs’ Mutual Benefit. In 1910, The Florida Sheriffs' Mutual Benefit Association changed names to become the Florida Sheriffs Association. The FSA served citizens of Florida by enhancing and supporting the needs of Florida’s law-enforcement community. 
Since then, FSA’s development of law enforcement, educational and charitable activities within the state helped transform it into one of the largest state law enforcement agencies in the nation.

==Services==
FSA provides services such as training, special task forces and legislative and legal services to help improve Florida Sheriffs' Offices and the law-enforcement community. These include:
*Fostering effective law enforcement within the state.
*Offering training, educational seminars and professional networking opportunities for law-enforcement officers.
*Working in partnership with state and local government to develop and implement public policies.
*Providing discount purchasing programs for state and local government agencies and affordable insurance programs for Sheriffs' Offices.
*Promoting public support of the Florida Sheriffs Youth Ranches, the Florida Sheriff's Explorer youth program and Teen Driver Challenge.
*Informing the public of new developments and trends in law enforcement, crime prevention and public safety.

==Leadership==
FSA is managed by a 17-member elected [[board of directors]], all of whom are Sheriffs. The board consists of 12 directors and five officers. To insure statewide [[Representation (politics)|representation]], active member Sheriffs in each of four divided districts nominate three directors from each district to comprise the 12-member board. The five officers are nominated from any of the four districts.
The FSA’s current appointed [[executive director]] is Steve Casey.

==Key Programs==

===Florida Sheriffs Youth Ranches===
In 1957, the FSA founded the Florida Sheriffs Boys Ranch, built to prevent delinquency and help Florida's youth to become lawful, resilient and productive citizens.
Although the project struggled to stay afloat in its first years of operation, it eventually became the [[Florida Sheriffs Youth Ranches]] (FSYR) and has expanded to over six different locations throughout the state. The FSYR has provided over 100,000 boys and girls with residential care, camp services and family services.

===FSA Teen Driver Challenge===
In 2006, the FSA developed the [[Teen Driver Challenge]], a [[road traffic safety]] program to combat the high crash and fatality rate of teen drivers on [[State Roads in Florida|Florida highways and state roads]]. The program is designed around both in-classroom activities and hands-on instructional driving by certified and highly trained law-enforcement officers.
The course is currently offered in 35 of the 67 [[counties in Florida]].

===Florida Deputy Sheriffs Association===
In 2008, the Florida Sheriffs Association launched the Florida Deputy Sheriffs Association, a professional membership association for law enforcement, corrections and support personnel working for Florida Sheriffs’ Offices. The association establishes a forum for knowledge, cohesiveness and authority for all state law enforcement professionals.

==Other Accomplishments==
*FSA established the Florida Sheriff’s Bureau in 1955, forerunner to what is known today as the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.
*FSA founded the Florida Law Enforcement Academy, the state's first statewide training academy, in 1963.
*FSA established the Florida Sheriffs Self-Insurance Fund in 1978, which has saved taxpayers millions of dollars on liability claims and annual premiums.
*FSA pioneered accreditation in the state and was co-founder of the Commission for Florida Law Enforcement Accreditation in 1995.
*FSA built a Law Enforcement Memorial recognizing Florida deputies and officers killed in the line of duty. The memorial, located at the front of the FSA headquarters, is open to view during daylight hours.

The '''Floyd Landis doping case''' is a [[Doping (sport)|doping]] scandal that featured [[Floyd Landis]], the initial winner of the [[2006 Tour de France]]. After a meltdown in [[2006 Tour de France, Stage 12 to Stage 20#Stage 16|Stage 16]], where he had lost ten minutes, Landis came back in [[2006 Tour de France, Stage 12 to Stage 20#Stage 17|Stage 17]], riding solo and passing his whole team. However, a urine sample taken from Landis immediately after his Stage 17 win has twice tested positive for banned synthetic [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] as well as a ratio of [[testosterone]] to [[epitestosterone]] nearly three times the limit allowed by [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/05/sports/05cnd-landis.ready.html|title=Backup Sample on Landis Is Positive|publisher=New York Times|date=2006-08-05 | first=Juliet | last=Macur | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Union Cycliste Internationale|International Cycling Union]] stripped him of his 2006 Tour title. Second place finisher [[Óscar Pereiro]] was officially declared the winner.&lt;ref name="velonews.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.velonews.com/news/fea/13354.0.html |title=Backup Sample on Landis Is Positive |publisher=Velonews |date=2007-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705232319/http://www.velonews.com/news/fea/13354.0.html |archivedate=2008-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only previous Tour de France winner to be disqualified was [[1904 Tour de France]] winner [[Maurice Garin]].

==Prelude==
{{main|2006 Tour de France}}

Landis was wearing the yellow jersey as leader of the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]] prior to [[2006 Tour de France, Stage 12 to Stage 20#Stage 16|Stage 16]], but then lost eight minutes and seemed finished. However, Landis spectacularly came back in [[2006 Tour de France, Stage 12 to Stage 20#Stage 17|Stage 17]], winning the stage and cutting his deficit to leader [[Óscar Pereiro]] to half a minute. Overtaking him after the Stage 19 time trial, Landis was celebrated as the winner of the 2006 Tour de France.

==Doping accusation==
On July 27, 2006, four days after the Tour had finished, the [[Phonak (cycling team)|Phonak cycling team]] announced Landis had a urine test come back positive, having an unusually high ratio of the hormone [[testosterone]] to the hormone [[epitestosterone]] (T/E ratio) after his epic performance in Stage 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/cycling/5221122.stm | title=Landis gives positive drugs test  | publisher=BBC Sport | date= 2006-07-27  | accessdate= 2006-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landis denied having doped and placed faith in a test using his backup sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= Mar| last=Toman| author= | title=Landis requests backup sample to clear doping allegations | date= 2006-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonak stated that he would be dismissed should the backup sample also test positive.

{{Doping in sport sidebar |expanded=History}}

Following the reported positive drug test on his A sample, Landis suggested that the results had been improperly released by the UCI. On August 9, 2006, UCI president [[Pat McQuaid]] rejected the claim, saying, "We acted correctly. We informed the team, the rider, and the federation that there had been an irregularity. Then we issued a press release saying that an unnamed rider had been found positive in the Tour.  Landis's team published his name, two days later...  I have full faith in that laboratory, and there are stringent measures kept in place by the anti-doping agencies to ensure they proceed correctly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On August 1, 2006, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that, according to a UCI source, Landis's urine test had revealed [[testosterone (medication)|synthetic testosterone]] in his body.&lt;ref name="macur1" /&gt; Despite this, Landis claimed his innocence, promising to "explain to the world why this is not a doping case, but a natural occurrence" and that the testosterone in his body was "natural and produced by my own organism."&lt;ref name = "NYT31July" /&gt; The variety of explanations offered up by Landis provided fodder for many skeptical columns by sports journalists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

David Black, a forensic toxicologist for Nashville-based Aegis Sciences, said, "There are not hundreds of plausible explanations. If the tests were so unreliable that there were hundreds of possible reasons, there would be no point in performing the tests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On September 8, 2006, Landis's attorney announced that he would formally request that the case be dropped on the grounds that LNDD's 370-page report revealed inconsistencies in the way the samples were handled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Exogenous testosterone===
Media reports said that synthetic testosterone had been detected in the A sample, using the carbon [[isotope]] ratio test, [[Isotope-ratio mass spectrometry|CIR]], conducted at LNDD. The presence of synthetic testosterone means that some of the testosterone in Landis’s body came from an external source and was not naturally produced by his own system. These results conflicted with Landis's public assertion that it was a natural occurrence.&lt;ref name = "NYT31July"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/wfaa/latestnews/stories/wfaa060731_mo_landis.ae9233.html |title=Synthetic testosterone found in Landis urine sample |publisher=Associated Press |date=2006-07-31 |accessdate=2007-09-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212001400/http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/wfaa/latestnews/stories/wfaa060731_mo_landis.ae9233.html |archivedate=2007-12-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIR test is used to distinguish between testosterone produced naturally by the athlete's body and synthetic testosterone introduced from an outside source. The test is performed by [[Isotope Mass Spectrometry|Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry]] (IRMS). According to [[Gary I. Wadler, M.D.]], a member of the World Anti-Doping Agency, the carbon isotope ratio test needs to be done only once, on either an A or on a B sample, particularly if the athlete’s T/E ratio is high as in Landis's case.&lt;ref name = "NYT31July"/&gt;

It has been suggested that Landis may have been using testosterone over the long term but was either masking it or diluting it to avoid detection. The positive test result would therefore have been from a mistake with the alleged doping program on one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= Philip | last=Hersh | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/1085973981.html?dids=1085973981:1085973981&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+31%2C+2006&amp;author=Philip+Hersh&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=2&amp;desc=French-fried+conundrum+Landis+doping+case+not+at+all+clear-cut

As part of its [[prosecution]], USADA had remaining "B" portions of the other samples tested by the LNDD. Four of those samples also showed the presence of synthetic testosterone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | first=Bonnie  | last=DeSimone  | author=  | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/cycling/columns/story?id=2871865  | title=Breakdown of Landis' Tour de France drug tests  | work=  | publisher=ESPN    | date=2006-05-16  | accessdate=2006-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeals===
On September 11, 2006, Landis asked an USADA review board to dismiss the doping charges against him. His request was made on the basis that the A and B urine samples from Stage 17 did not meet the established WADA criteria for a positive doping offense. Landis's lawyer said in a statement: "The single testosterone/epitestosterone analysis in this case is replete with fundamental, gross errors." The lawyer also claimed that the positive finding on the B sample came from a sample number not assigned to Landis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Gene|last=Charry|author=|url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/breakingnews/feedstory/0,,-6073748,00.html|title=Landis asks USADA to drop case against him|work=Guardian|date=2006-09-13|accessdate=2006-09-14|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|author=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/cycling/5337382.stm|title=Landis states his case to USADA|work=Sport: Cycling|publisher=BBC|date=2006-09-13|accessdate=2006-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review board notified Landis on September 18 of its recommendation that USADA proceed with the disciplinary process. [[Howard Jacobs]], attorney for Landis, requested an open hearing by the [[American Arbitration Association]] to contest potential sanctions against the athlete.

===Arnie Baker===
On April 14, 2009, the French newspaper ''L'Express'' reported information that had been obtained from hacking into the LNDD was sent to a Canadian counterpart lab from a computer registered to [[Arnie Baker]], Landis' former coach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/greenpeace-revelations-sur-l-affaire-d-espionnage_754205.html&lt;/ref&gt; The French police later invited Landis and Baker to attend a court hearing to answer questions regarding the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/may/29/1s29landis215559-landis-case-twist-hacking-lab-com/ Landis case twist: hacking lab computer]&lt;/ref&gt; On July 31, 2009, ''The New York Times'' featured an article on corporate spying in France, stating that, "No evidence has surfaced to connect Mr. Landis or Dr. Baker to the hacking, and each has denied any involvement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/01/business/global/01iht-spy.html|work=The New York Times|title=In French Inquiry, a Glimpse at Corporate Spying|first=David|last=Jolly|date=2009-08-01|accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verdict==
On September 20, 2007, Landis' doping accusation was upheld by an arbitration panel deciding between him and USADA and Landis was banned for two years. In response to this, International Cycling Union formally stripped him of his 2006 Tour de France title and second-place finisher Óscar Pereiro was officially declared the winner.&lt;ref name="velonews.com"/&gt; The only previous Tour de France winner to be disqualified was 1904 Tour de France winner, Maurice Garin.

Landis was also banned from the sport for two years, dated retroactively to January 2007. Even before the USADA's ruling on this matter, the controversy resulted in the disbandment of Landis's former team, Phonak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hood|first=Andrew|url=http://www.velonews.com/news/fea/10712.0.html|title=End of the road for Phonak|date=2006-08-15|accessdate=2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landis agreed not to participate in any racing in France in 2007 to allow him to postpone a hearing of his case there for as long as possible. On December 19, 2007, the [[Agence Francaise Lutte contre le Dopage|French Anti-Doping Agency]] found him guilty of doping, and issued a two-year suspension, which barred him from racing in France until early 2009.

After this verdict, Landis tried to reverse this decision at the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]]. On June 20, 2008, he lost this appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/cycling/2304460/Floyd-Landis-loses-2006-Tour-de-France-appeal.html|title=Floyd Landis loses 2006 Tour de France appeal|work=The Telegraph|date=|access-date=|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008 Landis moved in U.S. federal court to vacate the CAS arbitration award, contending that the procurement of the award was tainted by partiality and conflicts of interest.  Additionally, Landis contested the $100,000 US "costs" award, characterizing it as a disguised punitive award.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/Floyd_Landis_federal_case&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2008 Landis and the USADA reached a settlement and agreed to withdraw the case with prejudice, leading some to believe that the USADA waived the $100,000 fine in return for the cessation of litigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trustbut.blogspot.com/2008/12/fed-case-over.html Trust But Verify, Federal Case Over blog post]&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless of the reasons for dismissing the case, litigation is now complete and final.

==Reaction among cyclists==
After Landis' A sample tested positive for testosterone, retired American cyclist and three-time Tour de France winner [[Greg LeMond]] doubted whether additional doping tests would reverse Landis's earlier results.  He stated,

{{quote|"I hope the sampling comes back negative; unfortunately, I think the labs in Europe are very professional."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mom keeps the faith / LeMond: Take High Road|url=http://www.pe.com/sports/other/stories/PE_Sports_Local_D_landis_mom_28.1c9089c.html|date=2006-07-27|publisher=[[PE.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fellow professional and 10 time Tour de France cyclist, Australian [[Stuart O'Grady]], left no doubt as to his view in an interview for the Australian 60 Minutes program televised on 22 July 2007. The reporter Liz Hayes asked O'Grady: "Would anyone have picked that — that the winner of last year's race was a drug cheat?" O'Grady replied,

{{quote|"I would have, because I was there with him that day when he was in that breakaway. I was actually 13 minutes ahead of him and he caught us on his own and then he basically rode us all off the wheel..... I thought that was impossible, what he did. I'm not a bad bike rider and, you know, he made me look like a little kid."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=279595 Tour de crash] Televised Sunday, July 22, 2007 Reporter: Liz Hayes; Producers: Stephen Rice, Howard Sacre&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Support from Lance Armstrong===

On July 28, 2006, Landis appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' to explain his situation and reiterate his innocence. [[Lance Armstrong]], the seven-time and subsequently disgraced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/09/lance-armstrong-cycling-doping-scandal|title=Timeline: Lance Armstrong’s journey from deity to disgrace|author=Fotheringham, William|work=[[Guardian Australia]]|location=|date=March 9, 2015|access-date=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|subject=Armstrong, Lance|subject-link=Lance Armstrong|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/30984312|format=Streaming video|title=Armstrong on drugs, history and the future|interviewer=[[Dan Roan]]|publisher=[[BBC News]]|location=United Kingdom|date=January 27, 2015|access-date=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; former Tour de France winner, phoned the show to express support for Landis, his former teammate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|title=Interview With Floyd Landis|work=[[Larry King Live]]|interviewer=[[Larry King]]|format=Transcripts|date=July 28, 2006|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0607/28/lkl.01.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong expressed skepticism of the French laboratory that conducted Landis's drug test, noting it is the same laboratory involved in some of the doping allegations against him.

Armstrong continuously expressed support for Landis and stated his conviction that the process is biased against athletes.

==Admission==

In May 2010, Landis admitted to doping, though he continued to deny taking testosterone at the 2006 Tour de France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-1279930/Floyd-Landis-reveals-I-took-drugs-career--I-won-Tour-France-2006.html?ito=feeds-newsxml | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Floyd Landis reveals: I took drugs during my career - but not when I won the Tour de France in 2006 | date=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ford Lio Ho Motor''' ({{zh|c=福特六和汽車}}) is a [[List of Taiwanese automakers|Taiwanese-based automaker]] and the primary dealer of Ford vehicles in Taiwan formed in 1972. It is 70 percent owned by [[Dearborn, Michigan]]-based [[Ford Motor Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2010/11/26/2003489426 |title=Ford Lio Ho rolls out 2 millionth car |work=taipeitimes.com |publisher=[[Taipei Times]] |date=20 November 2010 |accessdate=27 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining 30 per cent is owned by investors in the former Lio Ho Automotive Industrial Corporation, which previously assembled [[Toyota]] vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4JR0tXiDpDcC&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;ots=XVcKo9OCre&amp;dq=Ford%20Lio%20Ho%20Motor%20toyota&amp;pg=PA180#v=onepage&amp;q=Ford%20Lio%20Ho%20Motor%20toyota&amp;f=true ''Multinational corporations and United States foreign policy: Hearings, Ninety-third Congress &amp;#91;Ninety-fourth Congress, second session&amp;#93;, Part 3''], U.S. Government Printing Office, 1973, page 180&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taiwan-built [[Ford Laser#Laser (KC) and Meteor (GC)|Laser hatchback]] was exported to [[Canada]] in the late 1980s, badged as the [[Mercury Tracer#First generation (1988–1989)|Mercury Tracer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mtW2AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Ford+Lio+Ho+exports+canada+tracer+five+door&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22mercury+tracers%22++ ''Trade Opportunities in Taiwan''], Volume 15, Issues 1-26, Far East Trade Services, Incorporated, 1987, page 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Ford models unique to [[Taiwan]] include the '''Ford Tierra''', based on the Mazda 323 sedan, later rebadged as the facelifted [[Ford Laser]] in other Asian markets, the '''Ford Activa''', a rebadged Mazda 323 sedan and hatchback, and the '''Ford Mondeo Metrostar''' which later also sold in China,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/business/asia/2001/08/10/15574/Ford's-Mondeo.htm Ford's Mondeo Metrostar takes lead], Billy Chamberlin, ''[[The China Post]]''

[[File:1990s Taiwan Ford Laser Nobel 1.6J left-end.jpg|thumb|left|1990s Taiwan Ford Laser Nobel]]
Taiwan-market Ford and Mazda vehicles include locally assembled [[Ford Mondeo]], [[Ford Focus (International)|Ford Focus]], [[Ford Fiesta]], [[Ford Escape]], [[Mazda 3]], [[Mazda 5]], and [[Mazda Tribute]]. Also, all 2007 model year Asia/Pacific (except China and South Korean markets) Ford Escapes are assembled by Ford Lio Ho. The Taiwan-assembled Mondeo is also exported to [[China]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. After the ban on diesel-engined passenger cars was lifted in Taiwan in 2004, Ford Liou Ho became the first local manufacturer to build a diesel car. This was a diesel Focus, introduced in August 2007.&lt;ref name=AIPML&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ford Liou Ho Motor, Yulon Motor, China Motor in Taiwan planning to expand exports of complete vehicles | url = http://www.marklines.com/en/report/rep625_200712 | publisher = MarkLines | work = Automotive Information Platform | issue = 625 | date = 2007-11-23 | accessdate = 2012-12-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120315090407/http://www.marklines.com/en/report/rep625_200712 | archivedate = 2012-03-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Ford divested [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] and [[Land Rover]] in 2008, and significantly reduced share-holding of [[Mazda]] in 2010, the Taiwanese units of these brands were organized under Ford Liou Ho.

==Ford Lio Ho Design Technology Center==
Ford Lio Ho Design Technology Center or Ford Design &amp; Research Center was built and established by the end of 2002 in Taipei. The Design Technology Center was in charge of products sold mainly within the [[Asian Pacific]] markets including [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[China]], and [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobile.autonet.com.tw/cgi-bin/file_view.cgi?a1020027010209 Ford Lio Ho Design Technology Center Planned], 邵長玲, ''[[Auto Net]]''

Noticeable products include the 2005 Ford Equator Concept which later spawned the Asian Pacific [[Ford Escape|Ford Escape (ZC)]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.netcarshow.com/ford/2005-equator_concept/ 2005 Ford Equator Concept], "Net car Show"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ford Tierra]], [[Ford Ixion]], [[Ford Mondeo (first generation)#facelift|Ford Mondeo M2000 facelift]], [[Ford Mondeo (second generation)|Ford Mondeo Metrostar]], [[Ford Escape|Ford Escape ZC extensive facelift]] and [[Ford i-Max]]. With the [[Ford i-Max]] being one of the latest products designed by Lio Ho, the Design Technology Center was shut down due to the one Ford strategy.

'''''A Report of Some Proceedings on the Commission for the Trial of the Rebels in the Year 1746, in the County of Surry; And of Other Crown Cases: to which are Added Discourses Upon a Few Branches of the Crown Law''''', usually called simply '''''Crown Law''''' or '''''Crown Cases''''', is an influential treatise on the criminal law of England, written by Sir Michael Foster (1689 - 1763), judge of the [[King's Bench]] and later edited by his nephew, [[Michael Dodson]], barrister at law. It was first published in 1762. The third edition, edited by Dodson, and with an appendix containing new cases, was published in 1792 and seems to have been republished in 1809.

The book is divided into two sections. The first part, ''The Report'', usually called '''''Crown Cases''''', is a series of [[law reports]]. The second part, ''The Discourses'', usually called '''''Crown Law''''' is essentially a textbook. ''The Report'' covers the trials of the participants in the second [[Jacobite Rising of 1745]].

'''''Furniss v. Dawson''''' is an important [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] [[case law|case]] in the field of [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[tax]]. Its full name is ''Furniss (Inspector of Taxes) v. Dawson D.E.R., Furniss (Inspector of Taxes) v. Dawson G.E., Murdoch (Inspector of Taxes) v. Dawson R.S.'', and its [[Case citation|citation]] is [1984] A.C. 474, or alternatively [1984] 2 W.L.R. 226.

Its effect was to extend the applicability of [[The Ramsay Principle]].&lt;ref name = Tutt&gt;{{cite book | title = Tax Raiders: The Rossminster Affair |last=Tutt |first=Nigel |year=1985 |pages= 308 ''ff.''|publisher=Financial Training Publications |location=London |isbn=0-906322-76-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Ramsay Principle==
{{Main|The Ramsay Principle}}

The most important background to ''Furniss v. Dawson'' was the decision of the House of Lords a few years earlier in ''W. T. Ramsay Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners'' [1982] A. C. 300. In the Ramsay case, a company which had made a substantial [[capital gain]] had entered into a complex and self-cancelling series of transactions which had generated an artificial [[capital loss]]. The House of Lords decided that where a transaction has pre-arranged artificial steps which serve no commercial purpose other than to save tax, then the proper approach is to tax the {{em|effect}} of the transaction as a whole.

==Facts of the case==
The facts of the case are of less significance than the general principle which arose from it. However, in summary, they are:

* The three respondents, the Dawsons, were a father and his two sons. They owned two successful clothing [[limited company|companies]] called Fordham and Burton Ltd. and Kirkby Garments Ltd. (which are together called "the operating companies" throughout  the case).
* A company called Wood Bastow Holdings Ltd. offered to buy the operating companies from the Dawsons, and a price was agreed.
* If the Dawsons had sold the operating companies direct to Wood Bastow the Dawsons would have had to pay substantial [[capital gains tax]] ("CGT").
* There was a rule that if a person sold his shares in Company A to Company B, and instead of receiving cash he received shares in Company B, then there was no CGT payable immediately. Instead, CGT would become payable when (if ever) that person later sold his shares in company B.
* With the intention of taking advantage of this rule to delay the payment of CGT, the Dawsons arranged for an [[Isle of Man]] company called Greenjacket Investments Ltd. to be formed. (It was intended to become "Company B".)
* The Dawsons sold the operating companies to Greenjacket Investments Ltd. in exchange for the shares of Greenjacket Investments Ltd.
* Greenjacket Investments Ltd. sold the operating companies to Wood Bastow Holdings Ltd.

==Arguments==
The Dawsons argued:
# that the CGT rule mentioned above worked in their favour and they could not be taxed until such time (if ever) as they sold their shares in Greenjacket Investments Ltd.; and
# that the Ramsay Principle did not apply, since what they had done had "real" enduring consequences.
The tax authorities argued:
# that Greenjacket Investments Ltd. only existed as a vehicle to create a tax saving;
# that the ''effect'' of the transaction as a whole was that the Dawsons had sold the operating companies to Wood Bastow Holdings Ltd.;
# that because the intervening stages of the transaction had only been inserted to generate a tax saving, they were to be ignored under the Ramsay Principle, and instead the ''effect'' of the transaction should be taxed; and
# that the transaction being "real" (which is to say, not a sham) was not enough to save it from falling within the Ramsay Principle.
The Court of Appeal had given a judgement agreeing with the Dawsons on these points.

==The decision==
The judgement of the court was given by [[Lord Brightman]]. The other four judges ([[Lord Fraser of Tullybelton]], [[Lord Scarman]], [[Lord Roskill]] and [[Lord Bridge of Harwich]]) gave shorter judgements agreeing with Lord Brightman's more detailed judgement.

The court decided in favour of the Inland Revenue (as it then was: it is now [[HM Revenue and Customs]]).

The judgement can be viewed as a battle between:
* extending the principle in the [[Duke of Westminster's Case]] (Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Duke of Westminster [1936] A.C. 1); and
* extending the [[Ramsay Principle]]; 
two conflicting ideas which could, at their extremes, be expressed as:
* a rule that any taxpayer may organise his affairs in any way he wishes (provided it is legal) so as to minimise tax (Westminster) and
* a rule that a taxpayer will be taxed on the effect of his transactions, not upon the way he has chosen to organise them for tax purposes (Ramsay).

Lord Brightman came down firmly in favour of an extension of the Ramsay Principle. He said that the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|appeal court]] judge ([[Oliver L. J.]]), by finding for the Dawsons and favouring the Westminster rule, had wrongly limited the Ramsay Principle (as it had been expressed by [[Lord Diplock]] in a case called [[IRC v. Burmah Oil Co. Ltd.]]). Lord Brightman said:

{{quote|The effect of his [Oliver L. J.'s] judgment was to change Lord Diplock's formulation from "a pre-ordained series of transactions ... into which there are inserted steps that have no commercial purpose apart from the avoidance of a liability to tax" to "a pre-ordained series of transactions ... into which there are inserted steps that have no enduring legal consequences." That would confine the Ramsay principle to so-called self-cancelling transactions.}}

Oliver L. J. had given considerable weight to the fact that the existence of Greenjacket Investments Ltd. was real and had enduring consequences. At the end of the transaction, the Dawsons did not own the money which had been paid by Wood Bastow Ltd.: instead, Greenjacket Investments Ltd. owned that money and the Dawsons owned Greenjacket Investments Limited. Legally speaking, those are two very different situations. However Lord Brightman saw this as irrelevant. In any case where a predetermined series of transactions contains steps which are only there for the purpose of avoiding tax, the tax is to be calculated on the effect of the ''composite transaction'' as a whole.

==Consequences==
''Furniss v. Dawson'' has had far-reaching consequences. It applies not only to [[capital gains tax]] but to all forms of [[Tax#Direct and indirect taxation|direct taxation]]. It also applies in some of the jurisdictions where decisions of the [[Courts of England and Wales|English courts]] have [[precedent]]ial value.

{{Gun laws by country}}
'''Gun laws in the [[Czech Republic]]''' are in many respects less restrictive than elsewhere in the European Union ''(see [[Gun politics#European Union|Gun laws in the European Union]])''. A gun in the Czech Republic is available to anybody subject to acquiring a [[shall issue]] firearms license. Gun licenses may be obtained in a way similar to a driving license – by passing a gun proficiency exam, medical examination and having a clean criminal record. Unlike in most other European countries, the Czech gun legislation also permits a citizen to carry a [[Concealed carry|concealed]] weapon for [[self-defense]] – 250,000 out of some 300,000 legal gun owners have a concealed carry permit. The vast majority of Czech gun owners possess their firearms for protection, with hunting and sport shooting being less common.&lt;ref name="Eurobarometer"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; Firearms possession was severely restricted during [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]] and the subsequent [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–89)|communist dictatorship]], with ownership rates gradually rising ever since return of liberty following the 1989 [[Velvet Revolution]].

===Firearms and religious freedom===
Use of firearms as infantry weapons was pioneered in the [[Czech Crown lands]] in the early 15th century. In the 1420s and 1430s, the Czech [[Hussites|Hussite]] army led by [[Jan Žižka|Žižka]] started using firearms and artillery effectively on the battlefield (it had previously been used only during sieges of towns and castles due to its heavy weight and cumbersome operation). Use of field artillery in the [[Battle of Kutná Hora]] was first such recorded utilization. Firearms, alongside [[wagon fort]] strategy, proved indispensable for the mostly peasant reformationist army in their [[Hussite Wars|war for religious freedom]] against professional well armed and trained [[Hussite Wars#The first anti-Hussite crusade|Catholic Crusader invaders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===18th and 19th century gun laws===
Under common law tradition, civilians could possess firearms except artillery and insidious weapons (e.g. firearms that had appearance of other objects, etc.). First gun control laws were enacted during the early 18th century and dealt with illegal use of firearms for poaching. At the time, hunting was an exclusive noble privilege with little to no legal option for participation of common folk. Despite tough sentences of 12 years of hard labor or death introduced by a 1727 enactment, poaching with use of firearms remained widespread to the point that a 1732 Royal Gamekeeping Rules noted that gamekeepers were in constant danger of being shot by poachers.&lt;ref name="kalous"&gt;{{cite book

A 1754 enactment introduced up to one year imprisponment for ''carrying'' of daggers and pocket pistols ("''tercerols''") as well as tough sentencing for cases of attacking or resisting law enforcement with use of these weapons. Mere brandishing of a weapon against a state official was to be punished by life imprisonment. Wounding a state official would be punished by decapitation, killing of state official by cutting of hand followed by decapitation. Another 1754 enactment limited possibility of shooting within limits of certain cities to licensed shooting ranges, showing early development of sport shooting in the country.&lt;ref name="kalous" /&gt;

A 1789 decree on hunting also included firearms related measures. Any person merely passing through someone's hunting grounds was obliged to either strip trigger off or wrap their firearm in cloth under penalty of confiscation as well as complete ban on firearms possession.&lt;ref name="kalous" /&gt; Other enactments limited use of firearms in cities "close to buildings" and on state roads (especially shooting to air during religious celebrations), citing fire hazard as a main concern. In general, however, people were free to possess and carry firearms as they wished, with another 1797 enactment specifying that loaded firearms at home must be kept in a way preventing their use by children.&lt;ref name="kalous" /&gt;

Gun control enactments adopted in the following three decades focused on banning of insidious weapons such as daggers or rifles hidden in walking sticks. Despite having been already banned under the 1727 law, foreword to 1820 enactment lamented their widespread presence among population both within cities as well as in the countryside.&lt;ref name="kalous" /&gt;

===Imperial Regulation No. 223===
Following power reconciliation after failed 1848 revolution, emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] enacted the Imperial Regulation No. 223 in 1852. According to the regulation, citizens had the right to possess firearms in a number "needed for personal use"; possession of unusually high number of firearms required a special permit. Pistols shorter than 18 centimeters (entire length) were banned altogether as well as rifles disguised as walking sticks. Firearms and ammunition manufacturing was subject to licence acquisition.&lt;ref name="kalous" /&gt;

The law also introduced firearm carry permits. A carry permit was available to person with clean criminal record subject to paying a fee. It needed to be renewed after three years. Certain civilians did not need a permit: hunters, shooting range members, those wearing traditional clothing that had firearm as customary accessory. During emergency state, carrying of firearms could have been provisionally prohibited.&lt;ref name="kalous" /&gt;

Another regulation of 1857 explicitly banned private ownership of artillery, while 1898 regulation lifted the ban on small pistols (shorter than 18&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name="kalous" /&gt;

===Independent Czechoslovakia===
After the establishment of independent Czechoslovakia in 1918, the country kept the gun law of 1852 (see above), i.e. the citizens had the right to possess firearms and needed to obtain a permit in order to be able to carry them.&lt;ref name="sedlacek" /&gt;

After Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany in 1933, local ethnic German party established its own private security force. In 1938, Hitler brought his demand for succession of part of Czechoslovak borderland that was inhabited mostly by ethnic Germans. The party's security force was transformed into a paramilitary organization called "[[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]]" which started conducting terror operations against Czechoslovak state, Jews and ethnic Czechs. Especially snipers using scoped hunting rifles became particular concern. This led to adoption of Act No. 81/1938, on Firearms and Ammunition, which for the first time introduced licensing system not only for carrying of firearms, but also for firearms possession. Ministry of Interior was supposed to enact a regulation which would set rules for obtaining the licenses, however, this has not happened. Freikorps was receiving illegal shipments of firearms from Germany, making the envisioned licensing scheme useless. Thus, despite the new law, the enactment of 1852 still remained in force.

===Nazi gun ban===
[[File:Bekanntmachung cz.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Listing of Czechs executed for breaching Nazi gun ban on 21 October 1944]]
Germany, Poland and Hungary seized Czech borderland following the [[Munich agreement]] with UK, France and Italy, in October 1938, immediately putting into force their own restrictive gun laws within the occupied territory.

On 15 March 1939, Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia. On the very first day, Chief Commander of German forces ordered surrender of all firearms present within the occupied territory. This pertained not only to civilian owned firearms, but also to those held by the police force. In August 1939, this order was replaced by Regulation of [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia#German government|Reich Protector]] No. 20/39. The regulation again ordered surrender of all firearms and introduced personal responsibility of land plot owners for all firearms that would be found within their property. Reich and Protectorate officials (including police) and SS Members were exempt from the gun ban. Licensed hunters could own up to 5 hunting guns and up to 50 pieces of ammunition. Long rimfire rifles, sport pistols up to 6&amp;nbsp;mm calibre, air rifles and museum guns were allowed, however they needed to be registered. Simple failure to surrender a firearm carried up to 5 years imprisonment, while hiding of cache of firearms carried death penalty. Offenders were tried in front of German courts.&lt;ref name="sedlacek"&gt;{{cite book

Another Regulation of October 1939 ordered surrender of all books on firearms and explosives, as well as all air rifles "that look like military rifles", which was obviously aimed at vz.35 training air rifle that had appearance of vz.24 Czechoslovak main battle rifle.&lt;ref name="sedlacek" /&gt;

From May 1940 onwards, illegal possession of a firearm was punishable by death.&lt;ref name="sedlacek" /&gt;

===Communist gun ban===
The 1852 Imperial Regulation became again effective following the defeat of Germany in May 1945 and remained in force until 1950.&lt;ref name="sedlacek" /&gt;

In 1948, Communists conducted a successful coup in Czechoslovakia and started drafting a number of laws that would secure their grip on power, including the Firearms Act No. 162/1949 that became effective in February 1950. The new law introduced licensing for both possession and carrying. License to possess could be obtained from the District National (communist) Committee in case that "there is no concern of possible misuse". The same applied for license to carry, for which there was also a specific reason needed. Since 1961, the authority to issue license was given to local police chiefs, subject to the same requirements. Given that state apparatus constantly feared counterrevolution, only those deemed loyal to the party had any chance of getting a license.&lt;ref name="sedlacek" /&gt;

Ministry of Interior issued in June 1962 a secret guidance no. 34/1962 which specified conditions under which the police chiefs may have issued a license in accordance with the 1949 enactment. License to possess and carry short firearms may have been issued to named categories of persons (members of government, deputies, party functionaries, communist people's militia members, procurators, judges, etc.). Permit to possess and carry a long hunting rifle may have been issued only to "certified and reliable persons devoted to the socialist system". Referencing the secret guidance while issuing or denying the license was strictly forbidden.&lt;ref name="sedlacek" /&gt;

A new Firearms Act was adopted in 1983 as No. 147/1983. License remained [[may issue]] subject to consideration whether "public interest" doesn't prevent firearms possession by the given person. Apart from other formalities, applicant needed to present also declaration from their employer. Licenses were now available for sport shooting purposes, whereby the applicant needed to present recommendation of a local sport shooting society (which was run by the party). For the first time, the applicant also needed to be cleared by his general practitioner. Licenses were issued for a period of 3 years subject to renewal. Similarly as before, the enactment was accompanied by secret guidance of the Ministry of Interior No. 5/1984. The guidance again limited access to firearms to selected classes, mainly Communist Party members. Newly, sport shooters that achieved required performance bracket could also obtain license. Possession of hunting shotguns was less restrictive.&lt;ref name="sedlacek" /&gt;

===Post Velvet Revolution liberal laws===
Following the Velvet Revolution, an amendment act No. 49/1990 Coll. was adopted. Under the new law, any person older than 18, with clean criminal record, physically and mentally sound that did not pose threat of misuse of the firearm could have license issued. License may have been issued for purpose of hunting, sport shooting, exercise of profession and in special cases also for protection (concealed carry). Newly, denial of license could be challenged in court.&lt;ref name="sedlacek" /&gt; Even though the law remained [[may issue]], practice of issuing licenses became permissive.

A general overhaul of the gun laws took place through act No. 288/1995 Coll. Under the new act, gun license became shall issue. Also possession and concealed carry of pistols and revolvers became shall issue. The law further introduced mandatory firearms registration.&lt;ref name="sedlacek" /&gt;

Accession to [[European Union|EU]] required a new law compliant with the '''[[European Firearms Directive]]''', which was passed in 2002. The law significantly liberalized gun ownership, for example by allowing any legal weapon to be owned for self-defense and legalizing semiautomatic firearms which look like automatic, despite introducing more EU required regulation.&lt;ref name="sedlacek" /&gt;

== Current law ==
Cornerstones of current Czech gun law remain the same since the 1990s: precisely defined requirements that an applicant must meet in order to be granted a license. Once a person obtains the necessary license, the law is relatively permissive as regards both the type of firearms that become legally accessible, as well as possibility of their concealed carry for personal protection. At the same time, the issuing authority (police) firearm owners' database is connected to information needed for a background check and red flags any incidents that may lead to loss of license requirements. Similarly, health clearance by the general practitioner is needed for periodical renewal of license (every ten years).

=== Categories of licenses ===
There are five categories of gun license; however, these should not be mistaken with the categories for guns.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p16(2)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 16(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''A – Firearm collection'''

:'''B – Sport shooting'''

:'''C – Hunting'''

:'''D – Exercise of a profession'''

:'''E – Self-defense'''

===Obtaining a license===
An applicant applies for a gun license at a designated local office of the National police. If the conditions of age, qualification, health clearance, criminal integrity and personal reliability are met and a fee of 700 [[Czech koruna|CZK]] (US$ {{Format price|{{To USD|700|CZE}} }}) per category is paid, the license [[shall issue|shall be issued]] in thirty days.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p18"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 18&lt;/ref&gt; The license must be renewed every ten years&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p16(1)" /&gt; (no need to undergo qualification exam if the application is filed at least two months before termination of the previous license; health clearance still necessary&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p24(1)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 24(1)''&lt;/ref&gt;).

====Age====
To obtain a B or C category license, the applicant must be at least 18 years old. Under special circumstances, the applicant need only be 15 if a member of a sporting club, or 16 if taught hunting in schools with such a curriculum. To obtain an A, D or E category license, the applicant must be 21.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p19"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 19&lt;/ref&gt;

====Qualification====
[[File:ALS-koffer.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Apart from gun legislation, the theoretical part of the exam focuses also on first aid]]
[[File:Pistole cz75 hauptbaugruppen.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Field strip is usually required to demonstrate "safe handling"]]
Obtaining the license requires passing a theoretical and practical exam.
* '''Theoretical exam''': The theoretical exam consists of a written test of 30 multiple choice questions (Created and distributed by the Ministry of the Interior) with a maximum of 79 points possible. To pass the written exam, 67 points are needed for category A, 71 for category B or C, and 74 for category D or E.&lt;ref name="Firearms Regulation-p7(1)"&gt;''Firearms Regulation, Section 7(1)&lt;/ref&gt; The test deals with the following issues:
:*knowledge of firearms legislation,&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p21(4)(A)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 21(4)(A)&lt;/ref&gt;
:*knowledge of legislation related to legitimate use of firearm (e.g. self-defense),&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p21(4)(B)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 21(4)(B)&lt;/ref&gt;
:*general knowledge of firearms and ammunition,&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p21(4)(C)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 21(4)(C)&lt;/ref&gt; and
:*first aid.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p21(4)(D)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 21(4)(D)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Practical exam'''
:*Safe handling:&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p21(5)(A)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 21(5)(A)&lt;/ref&gt; this comprises:
::*inspecting, whether the firearm is loaded (safely unloading),&lt;ref name="Firearms Regulation"&gt;{{Citation

}}, Section 5(1)(A)&lt;/ref&gt;
::*field stripping as needed for clean-up,&lt;ref name="Firearms Regulation-p5(1)(B)"&gt;''Firearms Regulation, Section 5(1)(B)&lt;/ref&gt;
::*preparation of firearm and ammunition for shooting, shooting, procedure of handling the firearm in case of malfunction, conclusion of shooting.&lt;ref name="Firearms Regulation-p5(1)(C)"&gt;''Firearms Regulation, Section 5(1)(C)&lt;/ref&gt;
::Touching the trigger, pointing in different than appointed safe direction or trying to field strip loaded gun ([[dummy round]] is used) results in the applicant failing the exam. Depending on the categories of licenses sought, applicants may be asked to show their ability of safe manipulation on multiple firearms (typically [[CZ 75]] and/or [[CZ 82]] pistol, bolt-action [[CZ 452]] rifle and a double-barreled shotgun).&lt;ref name="Firearms Regulation-p5(3)"&gt;''Firearms Regulation, Section 5(3)&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Shooting test,&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p21(5)(B)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 21(5)(B)&lt;/ref&gt; which requires specific scores dependent on the category of license applied for:
::*For the B category license it is 25m on rifle target ([[A4 paper#A series|A4]] sheet sized) with 4 out of 5 rounds hitting the target sheet shooting from a rifle (2 out of five for A category). [[.22 Long Rifle]] chambered rifle is used.&lt;ref name="Firearms Regulation-p8(1)(B),(B)"&gt;''Firearms Regulation, Section 8(1)(B),(B)&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, an applicant can shoot a pistol on 50/20 pistol target at 10 m.
::*For the C category license, the applicant must fires at 25m with a rifle (same as cat. B) and also successfully hit the rifle target from the distance of 25m shooting from a shotgun (Usually double-barreled), 3 out of 4 rounds must hit the target (at least partially).&lt;ref name="Firearms Regulation-p8(1)(C)"&gt;''Firearms Regulation, Section 8(1)(C)&lt;/ref&gt;
::*For the E category license, the applicant must successfully hit the international pistol target 50/20 (50&amp;nbsp;cm x 50&amp;nbsp;cm) from a distance of 10m (15m for D category license) shooting from a pistol, 4 out of 5 rounds must hit the sheet (2 out of 5 for A category).&lt;ref name="Firearms Regulation-p8(1)(D),(E)"&gt;''Firearms Regulation, Section 8(1)(D),(E)&lt;/ref&gt;

::In each of the cases above, the actual score is irrelevant; the projectiles simply have to hit the target sheet within the circles.&lt;ref name="Firearms Regulation-p8(2)"&gt;''Firearms Regulation, Section 8(2)&lt;/ref&gt; Also in each case, the applicant is allowed 3 test shots to familiarize with the particular firearm used for the test. The shotgun is an exception to this, where only one round is allowed as a test shot.&lt;ref name="Firearms Regulation-p6(5)"&gt;''Firearms Regulation, Section 6(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

A person can obtain more or all of the categories at once. But the set of categories needs to be known before the exam and highest score needs to be met.&lt;ref name="Firearms Regulation-p7(2)"&gt;''Firearms Regulation, Section 7(2)&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, people obtain E and B category because these two categories provides the best versatility (almost any firearm can be owned and carried concealed). The D category is required by the law for the members of the municipal police (members of the state police do not need license for on duty firearms) and does not itself permit private gun ownership (unless the person obtains also other license category).&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p28(3)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 28(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Health clearance====
Applicant (license holder) must be cleared by his general practitioner as being fit to possess, carry and use a firearm. The health check includes probes into the applicant's anamnesis (i.e. medical history) and a complete physical screening (including eyesight, hearing, balance). The doctor may request examination by a specialist in case he deems it necessary to exclude illnesses or handicaps stated in the respective governmental regulation. Specialist medical examination is obligatory in case of illnesses and handicaps that restrict the ability to drive a car.&lt;ref name="Eligibility Regulation-p2(2)"&gt;Eligibility Regulation, Section 2(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

Governmental Regulation No. 493/2002 Coll.&lt;ref name="Eligibility Regulation"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; divides the listed illnesses and handicaps into four groups, covering various issues from psychological and psychiatrical to eyesight and hearing (for example, the applicant must be able to hear casual speech over distance of 6 meters to be cleared for the ''E'' category). Generally, the regulation is more permissive when it comes to the license categories ''A'' and ''B'', and more strict with view to the other categories, listing which illnesses and handicaps may curtail or outright prevent positive clearance by the general practitioner.&lt;ref name="Eligibility Regulation-Annex 1"&gt;Eligibility Regulation, Annex No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of the medical examination may be either full clearance, denial, or conditional clearance that lists obligatory health accessories (glasses, hearing aid, etc.) or sets obligatory escort when armed (e.g. ''B'' – sport shooters with minor psychological issues, or with addiction habits cured more than three years prior to the health check).&lt;ref name="Eligibility Regulation-p6(2)"&gt;Eligibility Regulation, Section 6(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

After unloading, a person aims the firearm into the barrel and dry fires it. The barrel is constructed so as to safely contain a fired bullet in case the owner mistakenly leaves a live cartridge in the chamber.]]

====Criminal integrity====
The enactment specifies the amount of time which must elapse after a person is released from prison for serving time for particular groups of crimes. Ex-convicts punished for committing selected crimes, such as public endangerment, or participation in organized crime group or murder, if sentenced to more than 12 years imprisonment, may never fulfill this condition.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p22"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 22&lt;/ref&gt; There is a central registry of criminal offenses in the Czech Republic. The criminal integrity is reviewed notwithstanding any possible [[expungement]] of the records for other purposes.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p22(4)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 22(4)&lt;/ref&gt;
* After being conditionally discharged, the criminal integrity is regained after the probation period ends or in 3 years in special cases
* After serving less than 2 years or being sentenced to different kind of punishment than imprisonment, the criminal integrity is regained after 5 years
* After being sentenced for 2 to 5 years, the criminal integrity is regained after 10 years
* After being sentenced for 5 to 12 years, the criminal integrity is regained after 20 years
* After being sentenced for more than 12 years (for defined crimes, such as murder, treason etc.) the criminal integrity is never regained.

Conditional discharge does not count, only the original sentence.

Police may order temporary seizure of firearm license and firearms in case that the holder is charged with any intentional crime, or a negligent crime connected with breach of duties relating to possession, carrying or use of firearms or ammunition.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p57(1)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 57(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal reliability====
A person who verifiably excessively drinks alcohol or uses illegal drugs, as well who was repeatedly found guilty of specified misdemeanors (e.g. related to firearms, [[DUI]], public order, etc.)  in the preceding three years, is considered unreliable for the purposes of issuing a gun license. The police has the right to inquire information regarding these issues also from municipal authorities (misdemeanors are dealt with by municipal authorities and there is no central registry related to them).&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p23"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Losing reliability is caused by:
* Committing a crime and being conditionally discharged, until the probation period ends.
* Excessive use of alcohol or addictive substances
* Committing multiple misdemeanors from specific segments of the law (Regarding Firearms, Explosives, Driving under influence, Czech Republic defense, public order, property and illegal hunting/fishing). Only one transgression in last 3 years is tolerated. Other types of misdemeanors do not count to personal reliability criteria.

Police may order temporary seizure of firearm license and firearms in case that administrative proceedings against the holder are initiated for committing selected misdemeanors (e.g. carrying while intoxicated, refusing to undergo intoxication test while armed, shooting outside licensed range unless in self-defense).&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p57(1)"/&gt;

====Obtaining of a license by a foreigner====
The law distinguishes foreigners according to their country of origin. For selected foreigners, a license is shall-issue as same as for Czech citizens, while for others it is a may-issue.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p18(3)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 18(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

{|
 | Style = "vertical-align: top;" |
* '''[[Shall-issue]]'''
** foreigners from countries of the [[European Union|EU]], [[European Economic Area]] and Switzerland (in case of their being granted temporary or permanent residency, then also their family members)
** foreigners from [[NATO]] countries
** foreigners having been granted permanent residency in the Czech Republic and long-term EU residency or long-term residency in other state of EU and longterm residency in the Czech Republic (and their family members, if having been granted long-term residency)
** persons having been granted international asylum in the Czech Republic

 | Style = "vertical-align: top;" |
* '''[[May-issue]]'''
** other foreigners (no appeal possible against decision of appropriate police department to deny permit)
|}

Foreign born residents are treated equally in the eye of Czech law (see above), but proof of a lack of criminal record in their country of origin must be provided;&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p24(2)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 24(2)&lt;/ref&gt; persons having residence also in another EU country must provide documentation showing that they are allowed to own a firearm therein.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p17(5)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 17(5)&lt;/ref&gt; All the documents must be translated into Czech language by a sworn translator.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p24(2)"/&gt;

Foreigners with registered place of residence in the Czech Republic may purchase firearms after obtaining corresponding licenses and permits; persons having residence also in another EU country must provide documentation showing that they are allowed to own such a firearm therein in order to be granted a permit to purchase a B category gun.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p12(4)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 12(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

The written test as well as the practical exam has to be taken in the Czech language. Until 31 December 2011, test-takers were allowed to use a sworn interpreter/translator, but this has since been forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zbrojniprukazy.cz/zbrojni-prukaz-pro-cizince/|title=Zbrojní průkaz pro cizince [Gun license for foreigners]|date=|first=|last=|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2014|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Regulation on Firearms competence exam"&gt;{{Citation

Under the current gun law, guns, ammunition and some accessories are divided into four categories (these should not be mistaken with categories of licenses):

'''A – Restricted firearms and accessories'''

:Includes [[Automatic firearm|full automatic]] firearms, military firearms and ammunition not inspected and marked for civilian use, some types of ammunition such as [[armor-piercing]] and [[incendiary ammunition]], [[night vision]] scopes, [[suppressor]]s. The use of [[hollow point ammunition]] in pistols is also restricted, however, hollow points are legal to purchase for rifles and pistol carbines.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p4" /&gt;

'''B – Guns requiring permit'''

:Includes [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi automatic]] and single or multiple shot handguns, revolvers, [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi automatic]] rifles and shotguns with magazine capacity over 3 rounds or with a detachable magazine, [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi automatic]] "military" style rifles, rim-fire firearms under 280 mm of length and all shotguns under 600 mm of length, flare guns with caliber larger than 16mm.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p5"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''C – Guns requiring registration'''

:Includes single shot or [[bolt action]] rifles longer than 280 mm, shotguns, semi-automatic rifles not included in B, air rifles with muzzle energy over 16 J and black powder repeaters.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p6"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''D – Guns available to adults above 18'''

:Includes [[air gun]]s (muzzle energy up to 16 J), mechanical guns (with kinetic energy from 150 N), replicas (black powder up to two shots – e.g. not black powder revolvers), airsoft guns, vintage firearms (manufactured prior to 1890), expansion guns and [[.22 CB cap]] (muzzle energy up to 7.5 J).&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p7"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 7&lt;/ref&gt;

A person must obtain the '''Gun License''' (Zbrojní průkaz) to be allowed to own gun of categories A, B and C.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p9-14"&gt;Firearms Act, Sections 9-14&lt;/ref&gt; To own a gun in the D category only the age of 18 is required.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p15"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 15&lt;/ref&gt; A, B and C category weapon has to be registered within 10 working day with the police after it is bought.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p42(1)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 42(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obtaining firearms ===
[[File:Cz75.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[CZ 75|ČZ 75]] is the most common gun in the country&lt;ref name="ihned 2010" /&gt;]]
Each of the A, B, C and E categories of gun license allows the person to buy a B or C category of gun. Holders of an A category license may, after being granted may-issue exemption by the police, also purchase an A category firearm; holders of D category may possess and carry any category of firearm (which remains the property of the employer).&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p28"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of B license the person is allowed to use their guns at shooting ranges. The C license is required by other laws for hunting. The E license allows the person to own a gun for self-defense purpose and carry the concealed weapon. All guns need to be registered with the police in 10 working days after buying except for the D category.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p28"/&gt;
* To obtain a gun from the '''A category''' (typically a full-automatic or select-fire firearm), the person must ask for a [[Concealed carry in the United States#May-Issue|may-issue]] ''"exemption"'' from the police and demonstrate a specific reason why they want such a weapon.
** For private physical persons, the only acceptable reason is collecting;&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p9(2)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 9(2)&lt;/ref&gt;
** for physical or legal persons having an armament license (this is a completely different certificate than the gun license) for professional purposes the acceptable reasons include providing security for dangerous or valuable shipments or VIP objects, manufacturing or testing of firearms, providing training in use of ''A category'' firearms, or filming in case that the firearm is adjusted for use of dummy rounds.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p9(2)"/&gt;
* '''The B category of guns''' (typically any semi-automatic firearm) requires permission from the police. Before buying the gun the person must visit the police and fill in the ''"permit to buy, own and carry"'' form for the particular weapon (depending on the police department, usually caliber and type of weapon is required).

:As a formality, a person must state a justifiable reason for purchasing a ''B category'' firearm, which include collecting, sporting, hunting or cultural activity, conducting business with firearms and ammunition, providing security, exercise of profession and self-defense.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p12(5)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 12(5)&lt;/ref&gt; The police will issue the permit in up to 30 days (usually immediately) and the permit is shall-issue if the applicant has a valid gun license (and fulfills all of its requirements, e.g. clean criminal record); the purchase permit is valid for 12 months.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p12(6),(7)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 12(6),(7)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sentry Safe class 350-2R safe combo panel.JPG|thumb|250pxright|The law specifies [[safe|safe storage]] requirements for those owning more than 2, 10 and 20 firearms.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p58(2)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 58(2)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
* '''The C category of guns''' can be bought at a gun shop after presenting the gun license. However, the gun needs to be registered later at the police.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p14"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 14&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no limit in the law on number of owned guns. The law specifies [[safe|safe storage]] requirements for those owning more than two weapons or more than 500 rounds of ammunition. The safe storage requirements are further exacerbated for those owning more than 10 and more than 20 firearms.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p58(2)"/&gt;

Possession of a firearm that does not belong to category D without a gun license (as well as sale, manufacturing, procurment, etc.) is a criminal offense which carries a penalty of up to two years imprisonment (up to eight years in defined cases).&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Code, Section 279&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shooting ranges ===
Firearm owners are allowed to practice only at licensed shooting ranges and may otherwise use the firearm only in case of self-defense, or when permitted by other laws (e.g. hunting).&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p28(5)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 28(5)&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, there are almost two hundred places opened for the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A person without a gun license has to be supervised (if younger than 18, then by a person at least 21 years old who has been a holder of a gun license for at least 3 years).&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p59(4)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 59(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carrying a firearm===
[[File:Queer Parade Brno 2008 - policejní zásahová jednotka.jpg|thumb|250px|right|It is forbidden to carry any weapon during a public demonstration. Police often conducts searches for weapons especially in case of parallel demonstrations of ideological adversaries, such as left-wing and right-wing extremists. The picture depicts police cordon defending ''[[Queer]] Parade 2008'' in [[Brno]] against intrusions by right-wing extremists: only those who undergo search for weapons are allowed further. See also: [[LGBT rights in the Czech Republic]].]]
Holders of different categories of firearms licenses have different possibility of carrying their firearms. In general, it is prohibited to carry firearms to court buildings (they may be left for safe keeping with the judicial guard upon entry before passing through metal detector), at demonstrations or mass meetings.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p76(1)(F)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 76(1)(F)&lt;/ref&gt; It is also generally considered irresponsible to take guns to clubs or bars even though it is not explicitly prohibited by law.

====License types====
* '''No carry:''' Holders of '''A''' license (collection purposes) may only obtain and possess firearms (also those falling into the ''A'' – restricted guns category, subject to being granted a may-issue permit) and are ''not'' allowed to carry them or shoot with them.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p28(1)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 28(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Transport only:''' Holders of '''B''' (sport shooting) license may only transport their firearms to and from the areas designated for sport shooting. The firearms must be transported in a closed container and in a manner that excludes their immediate use.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p28(2)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 28(2)&lt;/ref&gt;
:Meanwhile, holders of '''C''' (hunting) license may too transport their firearms only to and from the areas designated for hunting in a manner that excludes their immediate use. In case that they use public transportation, the firearm must also be transported in a closed container, otherwise it may be transported (carried unloaded) openly.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p28(2)"/&gt;
* '''Concealed carry:''' Holders of category '''D''' (exercise of profession) and '''E''' (self-defense) license may carry up to two firearms ready for immediate use (bullet-in-chamber). The firearms must be carried in concealed manner.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p28(3),(4)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 28(3),(4)&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement of concealed carry applies also for ''D'' holders of restricted firearms (e.g. private security with fully automatic firearms).&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p28(3)(A)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 28(3)(A)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Open carry:''' Only the members of [[Municipal Police]] and of the [[Czech National Bank]]'s security, as holders of '''D''' (exercise of profession) license, may carry their firearms openly while on duty.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p28(3)(B) alinea 2"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 28(3)(B) alinea 2&lt;/ref&gt; Members of state police, prison service and other governmental security agencies do not need any gun license and are permitted/required by other laws to open or concealed carry while on duty.&lt;ref name="Police Act"&gt;{{Citation

:Open carry may be allowed by police for special occasions, such as gun shows, war reenactments or liberation day celebrations; these are however technically referred to as "''public display of firearm''" rather than "carrying".

=== Ammunition restrictions ===
[[File:Hollow Point.JPG|thumb|right|Hollow point ammunition may be used only in long rifles. In general, no ammunition with higher wounding potential is allowed.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p4(B)(2)"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 4(B)(2)''&lt;/ref&gt;]]
All of the high-penetrating ([[Armor-piercing#Armor-piercing ammunition|armor-piercing]]) and [[Hollow-point bullet|hollow-point]] ammunition is classified as category A (see above).&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p4"&gt;''Firearms Act, Section 4''&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative to a hollow point ammunition was [[Federal Cartridge#Defense Ammunition Types|Federal EFMJ]], which has been classified into the arms group A in mid 2009, effectively outlawing it. Therefore, only [[Full metal jacket bullet|full metal jacket]] or soft-nosed semi-jacketed rounds and or just unjacketed bullets (lead only) are allowed. Generally, no ammunition with higher wounding potential is allowed.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p4(B)(2)"/&gt;

There is currently no restriction on caliber size and no restriction on magazine capacity. However, special safe storage requirements apply for those having more than 500, 10,000 and 20,000 bullets.&lt;ref name="Firearms Act-p58(2)"/&gt;

=== Armament licences ===
Gun licences equivalent for legal persons, such as shooting ranges or private security companies. Divided into 11 categories.
* '''A''' – Development or manufacturing of firearms/ammunition
* '''B''' – Repairs, modifications or deactivation of firearms/ammunition
* '''C''' – Firearms/ammunition buying and selling
* '''D''' – Lending and safekeeping of firearms/ammunition
* '''E''' – Deactivation or destruction of weapons/ammunition
* '''F''' – Training in handling and using firearms/ammunition
* '''G''' – Providing security for persons/property.
* '''H''' – Cultural, sports and hobby shooting activities.
* '''I''' – Collecting and displaying firearms/ammunition
* '''J''' – Securing tasks defined by special legal enactments.
* '''K''' – Pyrotechnical Survey (Replaces F category gun licence in 2017)

== Self defense with firearms ==
[[File:Defensive gun use training - Prague Cech Republic.jpg|thumb|450px|A woman trains real-life defensive gun use scenarios with live ammunition at a video shooting range in Prague, Czech Republic.]]
There are no specific legal provisions covering self-defense by a civilian using a firearm. The general provision regarding criminal aspects of self-defense are contained in the Section 29 (''Necessary self defense'') of the Criminal Code.&lt;ref name="Criminal Code"&gt;{{Citation

In general, Czech penal theory recognizes certain classes of circumstances where criminal &amp; civil liability will be excluded in respect of actions which would normally attract a criminal penalty. These include [[necessity (criminal law)|"utmost necessity"]], [[self defense|"necessary self defense"]] and other cases involving [[Gun politics in the Czech Republic#Eligible use of a gun|"eligible use of a gun"]].&lt;ref name="nov"&gt;{{Cite book

===Utmost necessity===
'''Utmost necessity''' may be invoked where an interest protected by the Criminal Code (such as [[right to property]] or right to life) is endangered. An example of necessity would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). The necessity may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only if there is no other way of avoiding it (''subsidiarity''), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of the necessity must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act (''proportionality'').&lt;ref name="nov"/&gt;

Necessity is excluded in cases where:&lt;ref name="nov"/&gt;
* the consequence of necessity is equal to or greater than that of endangerment
* the necessity continues after the endangerment has ceased
* the endangerment could have been deflected in other ways, i.e. with less serious consequences
* there is a duty to withstand the endangerment (a special situation which does not cover civilians)

===Necessary self defense===
The basis of '''necessary self-defense''' is deflection of an ''imminent'' or ''ongoing'' attack against an interest covered by the Criminal Code (such as right to property or right to life) by performing an action which would otherwise be punishable (such as use of a firearm against the other person). The imminent part means that a party is evidently and immediately threatened, it is not necessary to wait for the attacker to start the attack, especially if he is known for his aggressiveness. (That, however, is not the case if the attack is being prepared, but not imminent). The necessary self-defense may also be enacted when defending someone else's interest (i.e. defending their person or their property) as long as the same requirements are met. However, defending against a provoked attack is not considered "necessary self defense".&lt;ref name="nov"/&gt;

There is no requirement of subsidiarity: in this respect "necessary self defense" differs from "utmost necessity".  The main limitation is that the defense may not be '''manifestly disproportionate''' to the ''manner of the attack''. The manner of the attack is not the same as its intensity, which is only a part of it. For example, "intensity" covers whether the attack is committed by a single attacker or a group, with or without a gun, and the relative strength of the attacker and the party attacked, etc. But the manner also includes future imminent dangers, such as the possibility that single attacker might imminently be joined by others.&lt;ref name="nov"/&gt;

As regards proportionality, the law states that a self-defense may not be ''manifestly disproportionate''. It is evident, that for a self-defense to be successful, it has to be performed on a level exceeding the attack. Unlike in case of necessity, the consequence of necessary self-defense may be more serious than consequence of the attack. The defense may not be restricted to a passive one, it can also be active. It is not the outcome of the incident but the sequence of actions at its beginning which determines who is to be deemed the attacker, and who is the party attacked.&lt;ref name="nov"/&gt;

There are two main excesses, which are not recognized as necessary self-defense:&lt;ref name="nov"/&gt;
* defense, which continues after the attack is over, i.e. when a robber is running away without any loot (''excess in time'')
* defense, which is manifestly disproportionate, such as shooting children who steal apples from a tree, or shooting a perpetrator who has passed over a fence, without giving indication of further malevolent or criminal intentions (''excess in intensity'')

===Eligible use of a gun===
'''Eligible use of a gun''' is addressed in special enactments dealing with police, secret security service, prison guards etc.&lt;ref name="nov"/&gt; Thus for example a policeman may, under specified conditions, shoot on an escaping suspect, a privilege which an armed civilian does not have.&lt;ref name="Police Act" /&gt;

It is acceptable to defend from a violent attack anywhere on the street especially when a person is attacked with a knife or another deadly weapon. Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes sometimes a subject of controversy. In general, each case is investigated in great detail before being eventually dismissed as a legitimate self-defense.&lt;ref name= "VV" /&gt; The defense is judged according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender during the time of the imminent or ongoing attack, and not according to the view of persons who are judging it ex post.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The American style [[Castle Doctrine]] is also not applied however it is usually considered acceptable to defend from a ''violent'' home invasion with a firearm. In 2014, an amendment of laws concerning self-defense was proposed with the aim of giving greater leeway to defenders, especially in cases when they would not normally meet the bar for legitimate self-defense under the current legislation, but face extraordinary circumstances, such as confusion as a consequence of the attack, or when facing home invasion.&lt;ref name= "VV"&gt;{{cite web

A number of successful defensive uses of firearms or other weapon is being cleared as legitimate self-defense by authorities every year without raising wider public concern, including for example a 2014 shooting of an attacker by a bartender in Hořovice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://praha.idnes.cz/barman-zastrelil-v-horovicich-hosta-jednal-v-nutne-obrane-rekla-policie-1nk-/praha-zpravy.aspx?c=A140310_142626_praha-zpravy_bur|title=Barman z Hořovic zastřelil hosta v sebeobraně, konstatovala policie [Bartender in Hořovice shot a guest in self defense, police held]|date=17 January 2014|first=|last=|publisher=idnes.cz|accessdate=31 August 2014|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a 2014 shooting of an aggressive burglar in a garage by homeowner in [[Čimice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://praha.idnes.cz/muz-v-cimicich-postrelil-zlodeje-d4n-/praha-zpravy.aspx?c=A140117_133125_praha-zpravy_bur|title=Muž v pražských Čimicích načapal zloděje v garáži, jednoho postřelil [Man in Čimice caught burglars, shot one of them]|date=10 March 2014|first=|last=|publisher=idnes.cz|accessdate=31 August 2014|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some cases become rather notable, such as:
* In 1991 a group of [[white supremacy]] skinheads attacked a couple on a street in Prague after a man called on them to cease nazi salutes. The commotion was witnessed by Pavel Opočenský, a former [[Charter 77|anti-communist dissident]], [[émigré]] and famous sculptor, who immediately rushed to help the victims. During the fight, Opočenský used his hunting knife and killed a 17-year-old metal-bar-wielding skinhead. Opočenský was first charged with murder and spent 2 months in a [[Remand (detention)#Czech Republic 2|remand prison]]. He was released from remand prison after the charges were diminished to intentional infliction of bodily harm resulting in death (i.e. manslaughter). He was first convicted by the Municipal Court in Prague and conditionally sentenced to 2 years imprisonment with 4 years probation period. After a lengthy legal proceedings in which higher court repeatedly overturned the Municipal Court's convictions and ordered retrial, Opočenský's actions were finally cleared as legitimate self-defense by the High Court in Prague's decision four and half years later. The trial attracted attention of [[White power skinhead|WP]] skinheads who conducted various protests. A neo-nazi band ''Agrese 95'' released a song titled "We shall go together and kill Opočenský."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.rozhlas.cz/radiozurnal/podkuzi/_zprava/525859|title=S agresorem z očí do očí; na čí straně je zákon?

* In 2003, Slavoj Hašek was awoken by commotion from outside of his house. Hašek left his house with a shotgun and pursued a thief. After the thief got to his own car and drove it in Hašek's direction, he shot and killed him. Hašek was sentenced to five years imprisonment with the High Court in Olomouc arguing that the defense could not be legitimate, since the shot went through a side window rather than through the front windshield. Hašek was pardoned by President [[Václav Klaus]] shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hn.ihned.cz/c1-15047910-prezident-dal-milost-muzi-ktery-zastrelil-zlodeje-aut|title=Prezident dal milost muži, který zastřelil zloděje aut [President pardoned a man who shot a car thief]|date=10 October 2004|first=Aleš|last=Vojíř|publisher=ihned.cz|accessdate=13 October 2004|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2006 a private security guard with a pistol pursued on foot two men whom he believed tried to steal scrap metal. The men climbed on a railway embankment and started throwing rocks down at the guard who thereafter shot ten rounds in their direction, mortally wounding one of them in the head. The guard was first convicted of murder by the Municipal Court in Prague and given a sentence of 7 years imprisonment. The decision was changed by the High Court in Prague to conviction of intentional infliction of bodily harm resulting in death (i.e. manslaughter) and a sentence of five years imprisonment. The guard was finally exonerated by the Supreme Court in Brno which considered his action legitimate self-defense, noting that defense must be clearly more intensive than attack in order to be successful, and that the stones and bricks being thrown presented grave danger to the man's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/strilel-na-utocnika-soud-mu-dal-svobodu/r~i:article:240977/|title=Střílel na útočníka, soud mu dal svobodu [He shot an attacker, a court exonerated him]|date=19 September 2006|first=|last=|publisher=aktualne.cz|accessdate=31 August 2014|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2009, a security system at a scrap metal yard, which had been repeatedly burglarized, went off. The yard's owner was at the time on a hunt close to the yard and drove directly to it. A group of burglars jumped into their car and attempted to drive away. The owner used his shotgun and attempted to shoot the car's tires, hitting and wounding two of its occupants. He was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment for intentional infliction of bodily harm, a sentence that was confirmed on appeal. The owner received full presidential pardon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.ihned.cz/c1-51404870-klaus-omilostnil-majitele-sberny-ktery-postrelil-z-brokovnice-zlodeje|title=Klaus omilostnil majitele sběrny, který postřelil z brokovnice zloděje [Klaus pardoned an owner of scrap-yard who shot a thief]|date=30 March 2011|first=|last=|publisher=ihned.cz|accessdate=31 August 2014|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2010, a student from Azerbaijan was verbally attacked by a group of other foreigners in a bar in Prague. The student left the bar and proceeded to his friend's car, being followed by the group who continued to verbally attack him and his family and stating that "the issue needs to be solved immediately". The student recovered a knife from the car and took a stand. Thereafter one of the foreigners started punching him. The student stabbed one of the four attackers and then engaged in fight with another, whom he stabbed in the leg and who bled to death. The Municipal Court in Prague convicted the Azerbaijanian student of intentional infliction of bodily harm with excusable motive and sentenced him to two year in prison. The decision was overturned by the High Court in Prague who considered the death an outcome of legitimate self-defense. The Supreme State Attorney mounted an extraordinary appeal to the Supreme Court, which however confirmed the acquittal, noting that the verbal abuse continued even after the victim got into the car and he could thus legitimately perceive it as an ongoing attack. The Supreme Court also refused the Municipal Court's previous line of argumentation that the victim could have easily left the place once in the car (as there is no duty to retreat under Czech law) as well as its reasoning that the threat did not reach such an intensity as to justify a lethal defense.&lt;ref name="3 Tdo 1197/2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/domaci/krimi/student-ktery-v-praze-zabil-cizince-jednal-v-sebeobrane_295594.html#.VAL-PKYZWlM|title=Student, who killed a foreigner in Prague, acted in self-defense]|date=21 January 2014|first=|last=|publisher=ihned.cz|accessdate=31 August 2014|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2012, two brothers in their early 20s, one of them armed with a knife, attacked a 63-year-old man in a town in the Northern Bohemian borderland. He shot both attackers with his legally owned pistol, killing one of them. The police closed the case as legitimate self-defense six months later and brought charges against the surviving attacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/krimi/270760-muz-zastrelil-romskeho-mladika-v-tanvaldu-v-sebeobrane-rozhodl-zalobce.html|title=Muž zastřelil romského mladíka v Tanvaldu v sebeobraně, rozhodl žalobce [Man shot the Roma youngster in Tanvald in self-defense according to State Attorney]|date=18 June 2012|first=|last=|publisher=novinky.cz|accessdate=31 August 2014|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the '''[[2017 Chomutov incident]]''', a 37 year old man believed that a vehicular rampage is taking place in front of his home and in an effort to stop it, he shot the 34 year old driver dead. The ensuing court trial gained major public attention.
* In 2017, a man with criminal and drug abuse history attempted to rob a store in Prague, armed with a knife. He managed to stab the store clerk in the neck, but was then shot by store owner's wife and later died in hospital. Police ruled out the shooting as legitimate self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://praha.idnes.cz/prepadeni-obchodu-utocnik-strelba-d5d-/praha-zpravy.aspx?c=A170725_123832_praha-zpravy_rsr|title=Prodavačka zastřelila lupiče v sebeobraně, zjistila zatím policie [Shop owner shot a thief in self-defence, according to police]|date=29 June 2017|first=|last=|publisher=idnes.cz|accessdate=16 May 2018|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was later awarded for the deed by the Prague City Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lidovky.cz/prodavacka-ktera-branila-obchod-a-zastrelila-lupice-dostane-od-prahy-oceneni-1v3-/briefing.aspx?c=A170727_175900_ln_briefing_sij|title= Majitelka, která bránila svůj obchod a zastřelila lupiče, dostane od Prahy ocenění [Shop owner who defended her shop and shot thief dead will get an award]|date=28 June 2017|first=|last=|publisher=lidovky.cz|accessdate=16 May 2018|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2018, a man riding a tram in Ostrava started attacking other commuters with a glass bottle and fist punches. When he started to stomp on a head of one of them, a woman with concealed carry license (E license) pulled out her handgun and ordered him to stop or be shot. He complied and stopped the attack. She later received a medal from the City of Ostrava for the deed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.novinky.cz/krimi/459616-zena-ktera-v-ostravske-tramvaji-zachranila-s-pistoli-v-ruce-cestujici-dostala-medaili.html|title= Žena, která v ostravské tramvaji zachránila s pistolí v ruce cestující, dostala medaili [Woman that saved commuters in Ostrava tram has received a medal]|date=5 January 2018|first=|last=|publisher=novinky.cz|accessdate=16 May 2018|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity of guns==
[[File:PAR MK3 Rifle.jpg|thumb|PAR MK3 Rifle - locally produced AR-15 derivative popular for sport shooting as well as home defense]]
Given that firearms possession was banned during German Nazi occupation and then allowed only to those deemed loyal during the Communist regime, the right to be armed is seen as one of attributes of liberty in the country. Together with rapid rise of criminality involving illegal firearms following the Velvet Revolution, this led to fast rise in legal firearms ownership in the country in the 1990s. By 2001, some 3% of population possessed firearms licenses. The number of license holders was falling slightly from this point (faster as regards C licenses, while E licenses remained mostly level) until the 2015 EU Gun Ban Proposal, from which point the number of license holders began to rise again (mostly E licenses).&lt;ref name="gunlex-stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gunlex.cz/aktuality-strelci/pocet-drzitelu-zbrojnich-prukazu-klesa/|title=Gun license statistics between 2003–2012|language=Czech|publisher=Gunlex|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police recorded a tripling of average monthly applications for firearms licenses by the end of 2015 compared to the beginning of that year.&lt;ref name="police 2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.policie.cz/clanek/pribylo-zadatelu-o-zbrojni-prukaz.aspx|title=Přibylo žadatelů o zbrojní průkaz [The number of firearm license applications is rising]|date=2016-01-09|publisher=Police of the Czech Republic|accessdate=2016-02-18|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the number of license holders started to rise gradually, firearm sales rose even faster in 2015, mostly prompted by the EU efforts to restrict law abiding citizens' access to firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securitymagazin.cz/survival/chcete-si-poridit-strelnou-zbran-pospeste-si-evropska-komise-utahuje-srouby-1404048135.html|title=Chcete si pořídit střelnou zbraň?

For example, in 2011, after a wave of racially motivated attacks by Romani perpetrators against majority population victims, there was a rise of gun ownership in [[Šluknov Hook]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usti.idnes.cz/policie-nepomaha-a-nechrani-soudi-lide-na-sluknovsku-a-ozbrojuji-se-1ft-/usti-zpravy.aspx?c=A111024_185737_usti-zpravy_alh|title=Policie nepomáhá a nechrání, soudí lidé na Šluknovsku a ozbrojují se [The people in Šluknov District believe that the Police do not help and do not protect them, they are arming themselves]|publisher=iDnes.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

240,000 out of 300,000 (2016) gun owners have self-defense licenses, which permit them to carry concealed firearms for protection (any B or C category firearm, not only pistols). Following a wave of terror attacks around Europe, a number of politicians as well as security professionals started urging gun owners to actually carry firearms in order to be able to contribute to [[soft target]]s protection. These included, among many others, the President [[Miloš Zeman]], whose own wife obtained E license and a revolver,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blesk.cz/clanek/zpravy-politika/410026/ivana-zemanova-uz-ma-revolver-prezident-vyzval-cechy-ke-zbrojeni-proti-teroru.html|title=Ivana Zemanová už má revolver.

Unlike elsewhere in Europe, there is a relatively high proportion of semi-automatic firearms in the country, which are generally considered better suited for self-defense. The most owned firearms in the country are CZ 75 Compact and Glock 17.&lt;ref name="pop guns"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.novinky.cz/krimi/400494-cesi-se-zacinaji-vic-ozbrojovat-nejvetsi-zajem-je-o-pistole.html|title=Češi se začínají více ozbrojovat, největší zájem je o pistole [Czechs are buying more guns, mostly pistols]|publisher=novinky.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular guns include [[Browning 1911|1911]] clones and semi-automatic rifles made by Czech manufacturers, especially [[vz. 58]] and [[AR-15]] (of which there are 3 manufacturers).

It is generally not common for licensed gun owners to commit violent crimes with their guns, and most of the gun crimes are committed with illegal weapons that are beyond the control of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brnensky.denik.cz/zlociny-a-soudy/zbrane-k-zlocinum-ve-vetsine-pripadu-jsou-nelegalni-20120813.html|title=Zbraně k zločinům?

Police recorded 45 violent crimes (most of them, 17, being "dangerous threats" and 9 homicides, mostly intra-family) being committed with legal firearms (A,B,C category) in 2016, down from 71 in 2014 and 51 in 2015 respectively. Meanwhile, illegally possessed firearms (A,B,C category) were used in 71 violent crimes (9 murders) in 2016. When resorting to use of firearms, perpetrators mostly utilize non-lethal free-to-buy D category weapons (see above) that resemble real guns, with 906 such crimes taking place in 2016.&lt;ref name="Cro 2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://interaktivni.rozhlas.cz/zbrane-a-zlocin/|title=Zbraně a zločin: české podsvětí si vystačí s pistolemi z tržnice [Guns and crimes: Czech underworld usually uses free to buy guns]|date=2 March 2017|first=Jan|last=Cibulka|publisher=Český rozhlas|accessdate=2 March 2017|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from simple threats, the most common crime committed with firearms is robbery. Out of 1.500 robberies recorded in 2016, 153 took place with use of D category free-to-buy non-lethal weapons, 24 with illegally possessed firearms and 3 with legally possessed firearms (out of over 800,000 legally owned firearms).&lt;ref name="Cro 2017" /&gt;

Occasionally, crimes with legally owned guns do happen. The most notable examples include:
* '''2001 shooting of three policemen''' who were called by a woman claiming she was being attacked by her husband, František Jůza. On the scene, the policemen were negotiating with the husband who was threatening to commit suicide with his legally owned .38 revolver. When the situation seemed about to be peacefully solved, the hysteric wife ran into the room. Jůza thereafter shot three policemen (two mortally) and committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/nekdo-velmi-lhal-naznacil-policista-dbc-/domaci.aspx?c=A010516_214305_domaci_was|title=Někdo velmi lhal, naznačil policista  [Someone lied miserably, a policeman suggested]|date=|first=|last=|publisher=idnes.cz|accessdate=January 19, 2013|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Viktor Kalivoda''', a.k.a. '''''"Forest Killer"''''', who was planning to go on a killing spree in [[Prague Metro]] in 2005. As part of his preparation, the former policeman randomly murdered two hikers in a forest and another person four days later in another forest about 200&amp;nbsp;km from the first killing with his legally owned Glock.

Ďuričko later claimed he was acting in self-defense after Kočka attacked his pregnant girlfriend. According to the eyewitness testimony, it seemed highly unlikely.

==General attitudes to guns and efforts to change the law==
{{rquote|right|
''Those who [legally] carry guns are the most polite citizens. We don't take part in brawls, we don't quarrel on the street, we don't drink &amp; drive even with the lowest amount of alcohol in blood, because so little may be sufficient to lose the gun license and being forced to sell the gun.
|Stanislav Gibson, director of ''Lex'', a Czech firearms owners' lobby association&lt;ref name="ihned 2010" /&gt;
}}
The gun law in the Czech Republic is quite liberal. It is mostly caused by the fact that after the fall of communist regime people wanted to regain their rights to keep and bear arms and these needs resulted in passing quite liberal legislation in 1995, which surpassed the previous restrictive communist enactment. The law became widely accepted and led to quite massive civilian arming. Especially many businessmen felt the actual need to obtain a firearm because the times shortly after the [[Velvet Revolution]] are known for the rise in organized crime often related to the economic transformation in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.novinky.cz/krimi/181266-kriminalita-po-listopadu-v-cesku-vyrazne-vzrostla.html|title=Kriminalita po Listopadu v Česku výrazně vzrostla [The Criminality Rate has risen after the Velvet Revolution]|date=October 11, 2009|first=|last=|publisher=novinky.cz|accessdate=January 30, 2011|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest attempt on restricting firearm ownership happened in 1999, Minister of the interior Václav Grulich proposed a new law, compliant with the EU requirements, which would severely restrict gun ownership by requiring the membership in a sports club for sports license and proof of "danger to life" for concealed carry permit and self-defense gun ownership. However, the proposal  sparked opposition in the Chamber of deputies, the main concern being immense corruption potential in the proposed "may issue" doctrine, and the proposal was rejected by all parties in the chamber, except for Social Democrats, the party of Grulich himself. 5 years earlier, a similar motion was proposed by Zdeněk Trojan, a deputy for ČSSD, in a form of amendment to a government proposed firearms act (the one that was enacted in 1995) but found very little support and was rejected.

Due to falling crime rates, fewer people felt the need to carry a firearm for protection after 2000. This trend however changed in 2015 following the [[European migrant crisis]] and [[November 2015 Paris attacks]]. Gun advocacy groups argue that there is no point in banning guns because criminals will get guns no matter how tight the law is.&lt;ref name="ihned 2010" /&gt; At the same time, however, the rules are deemed to be restrictive enough to prevent criminals from easily obtaining firearms, while allowing upstanding citizens to own them for personal protection. For example, in 2010, a Norwegian terrorist, incited by reports of British newspapers describing Prague as "being the most important transit site point for illicit weapons in Europe", [[2011 Norway Attacks#Failed attempt to buy weapons in Prague|found himself unable to obtain any in the country]] when preparing for the [[2011 Norway attacks]].&lt;ref name="tyden"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/zahranici/evropa/norsky-vrah-shanel-zbrane-i-u-motorkaru-v-praze_207777.html|title=Norský vrah sháněl zbraně i u motorkářů v Praze|publisher=[[Týden]]|date=24 July 2011|language=Czech|postscript=.}} (Google Translate link)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prague"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.novinky.cz/zahranicni/evropa/239906-zbrane-jel-breivik-nakoupit-do-nebezpecne-prahy.html%3Fref%3Dzpravy-dne|title=Zbraně jel Breivik nakoupit do "nebezpečné Prahy"|publisher=[[novinky.cz]]|date=24 July 2011|language=Czech|postscript=.}} (Google Translate link)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cz po"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ceskapozice.cz/en/news/society/oslo-killer-sought-weapons-prague%E2%80%99s-underworld|title=Oslo killer sought weapons from Prague's underworld|publisher=Czech Position|date=25 July 2011|postscript=.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222162821/http://www.ceskapozice.cz/en/news/society/oslo-killer-sought-weapons-prague%E2%80%99s-underworld|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[2011 Norway Attacks#Polish copycat|a Polish terrorist]] obtained guns illegally in 1200&amp;nbsp;km distant Belgium, despite living mere 70&amp;nbsp;km from the Czech border.&lt;ref name="pol copy 3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.rp.pl/artykul/10,953875-Chemik-zafascynowany-Breivikiem.html|title=Chemik zafascynowany Breivikiem [A chemist fascinated by Breivik]|work=[[Rzeczpospolita]]|date=21 November 2012|accessdate=24 November 2012| language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the fact that Czech Republic has a strong tradition in firearms manufacturing and competition shooting contributes to generally moderate attitude to gun control.&lt;ref name="ihned 2010" /&gt;

Obligatory psychological testing for gun owners is a common subject of discussion, but it has always been rejected. Gun advocates point out that the nature of the tests and the parties responsible for them are not clear. It is also pointed out that it is unlikely that any psychological testing would reveal a potentially dangerous individual, because some famous killers in the past were members of the military or the law enforcement and passed very difficult psychological testing successfully.&lt;ref name="psycho gun lex" /&gt;
[[File:KK-liegend.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Sport shooting]] is the third most widespread sport in the Czech Republic (after [[association football|football]] and [[ice hockey]])&lt;ref name="ihned 2010" /&gt;]]
The most important changes to the 2002 Firearms Act were the following:
* '''2004''' – inclusion of pyrotechnical survey under the act (new category F license)
* '''2005''' – change of definition of historical firearms (i.e. D Cat not requiring license) from "developed or manufactured prior to 1890" to "manufactured prior to 1890" (i.e. functional replica possession requires license)
* '''2008'''
** inclusion of citizens of [[European Economic Area]] and [[Switzerland]] under the same set rules pertaining to citizens of EU countries
** tighter sanctions for use of firearms (concealed carry, hunting, shooting at ranges) while intoxicated (loss of license)
* '''2009''' – exemption for A category firearms may now be given only A category license holder (e.g. exemptions for fully automatic firearms would newly be given only for firearms collection purposes, not for self-defense), A category firearms may not be conceal carried any more,
* '''2014'''
** new licenses issued for 10 years instead of 5
** in case that police has a well founded suspicion that the gun owner's state of health has changed so as to lead to loss of his health clearance, they may ask him to present a new health clearance, failure to do so within 30 days may lead to revocation of license
** new possibility of license owner to surrender the license, if he wishes to do so
** possibility of B and C category license holders to obtain exemption for A category accessories (e.g. night vision scope for hunters)
** E category license holder allowed to [[handloading|reload ammunition]] for their own purposes (before, only B and C category license holders)
* '''2016'''
** in case that police have a well founded suspicion that the gun owner's state of health has changed so as to lead to loss of his health clearance so that he may present danger to self or others, they may provisionally seize his firearms and ammo; in case that the given person fails to comply, police may also enter his home without judicial warrant to do so; however, firearms must be returned to the owner immediately after reasons for seizure expire (e.g. owner presents new health clearance) – adopted in reaction to [[Uherský Brod shooting]]
** police allowed to enter home and other premises without judicial warrant in case that other reason for seizure of firearms exists and the owner has failed to surrender them (e.g. indictment for intentional felony)
** police use new registry of misdemeanors for determination of personal reliability – adopted in reaction to Uherský Brod shooting
* '''2017''' (effective since August 2017, delayed part of 2016 amendment)
** laser sights are not A category accessory any more
** government loses authority to order surrender of firearms during state of emergency or war
** F category license no longer issued, transferred to armament license
About a fifth of members of the Czech Parliament are holders of gun license; some of them are believed to conceal carry also within the parliament grounds (parliamentarians are not required to pass gun check on entry unlike other staff or visitors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lidovky.cz/vlastni-vas-poslanec-zbran-podivejte-se-f06-/ln_domov.asp?c=A120609_152109_ln_domov_ogo|title=Má váš poslanec zbrojní průkaz a zbraň?

=== 2014 European parliamentary elections ===
Generally, firearms possession is not a politicized issue that would be debated during Czech elections. The [[European Parliament election, 2014|2014 European Parliament election]] became an exception in connection with the Swedish [[European Commissioner]] [[Cecilia Malmström]]'s initiative to introduce new common EU rules that would significantly restrict the possibilities of legally owning firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/trafficking-in-firearms/docs/1_en_act_part1_v12.pdf| title=Firearms and the internal security of the EU: protecting citizens and disrupting illegal trafficking  |publisher=European Commission|accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with that, a Czech gun owners association asked the parties running in the elections in the Czech Republic whether they agree (1) that the citizens should have the right to own and carry firearms, (2) that the competence on deciding firearms issues should lie in the hands of the nation states and not be decided on the EU level, and (3) whether they support Malmström's activity leading to the curbing of the right of upstanding citizens to own and carry firearms. Out of 39 parties running, 22 answered. The answers were almost unanimously positive to the first two questions and negative to the third one. Exceptions were only two fringe parties, the [[Green Party (Czech Republic)|Greens]] – which, while supporting the right for gun ownership in its current form, also support further unification of rules on the European level and labeled the opposing reaction to  Malmström's proposal as premature, and the [[Czech Pirate Party|Pirates]] which support unification of the rules leading to less restrictions elsewhere, commenting that one may not cross the borders out of the Czech Republic legally even with a pepper spray. Other fringe parties at the same time voiced their intent to introduce American style castle doctrine or to arm the general population following the example of the [[Conscription in Switzerland|Swiss militia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gunlex.cz/volby-do-evropskeho-parlamentu-2014/|title=Volby do Evropského parlamentu 2014 [2014 Elections to the European parliament]|publisher=gunlex.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2015 European Union "Gun Ban" Directive ===

{{Main|European_Firearms_Directive#Amending_Directive_.28EU.29_2017.2F853|l1=Amending Directive (EU) 2017/853}}
The European Commission proposed a package of measures aimed to "make it more difficult to acquire firearms in the European Union" on 18 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-6110_en.htm| title=European Commission strengthens control of firearms across the EU  |publisher=European Commission|accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Juncker introduced the aim of amending the [[European Firearms Directive]] as a Commission's reaction to a previous wave of Islamist terror attacks in several EU cities. The main aim of the Commission proposal rested in banning B7 firearms (and objects that look alike), even though no such firearm has previously been used during commitment of a terror attack in EU (of 31 terror attacks, 9 were committed with guns, the other 22 with explosives or other means. Of these 9, 8 cases made use of either illegally smuggled or illegally refurbished deactivated firearms  while during the [[2015 Copenhagen shootings]] a military rifle stolen from the army was used.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armietiro.it/le-b7-mai-usate-armi-8075| title=Le B7?

:: '' The Ministers are fully aware of the need to fight actively against terrorism. As regards the regulation of the possession of firearms, it is necessary to focus the adopted measures primarily on illegal firearms, not legally-held firearms. Illegal firearms represent a serious threat. Within the European Union, it is necessary to prevent infiltration of illegal firearms from the risk areas. It should be taken into account that bans on possession of certain types of firearms that are not, in fact, abused for terrorist acts can lead to negative consequences, especially to a transition of these firearms into the illegal sphere. The V4 states have profound historical experience with such implications.''

Ministry of Interior published in May 2016 its Impact Assessment Analysis on the proposed revision of directive No. 91/477/EEC. According to the Ministry, the main impacts of the proposal, if passed, would be:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/analyza-moznych-dopadu-revize-smernice-o-kontrole-strelnych-zbrani.aspx| title=Analýza možných dopadů revize směrnice 91/477/EHS o kontrole nabývání a držení střelných zbraní |publisher=Czech Ministry of Interior|accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Risks to internal security''': According to Czech Ministry of Interior, the main danger of the proposal rested in massive transfer of now legal firearms into illegality, with up to hundreds of thousands of legal firearms entering black market. While the original Commission proposal would affect 40,000 – 50,000 firearms legally possessed by Czech citizens, Dutch EU Council Presidency proposal of 4 April 2016 would affect some 400,000 legally owned firearms, i.e. making half of all Czech legally owned firearms illegal with large proportion of gun owners likely refusing to surrender their firearms. The proposal as such is in direct contradiction with Ministry’s long-term objective of lowering of number of illegal firearms and of conducting effective supervision of firearm owners.
* '''Risk to defensive capabilities''': Security forces are not changing armaments annually, and thus small arms manufacturers need civilians as key customers. Crippling of civilian firearms market would likely lead to end of firearms manufacturing in the Czech Republic. At the same time, familiarity with semi-automatic versions of army rifles by civilians is a clear defensive advantage in case these people need to be drafted to defend the country.
* '''Threat to national culture''': The proposal would lead to permanent deactivation of firearms owned by collectors and museums, including army museums, even though there is no empirical data supporting need for such a measure.
* '''Rise of unemployment''': The proposal would lead to cancellation of tens of thousands of work places in the Czech Republic alone.
* '''Impact on hunting''': Semiautomatic rifles have been purposefully used for hunting in the Czech Republic since at least 1946 and they are especially effective and popular in curbing wild boar overpopulation that is responsible for large number of car accidents as well as damage to agriculture. Banning of these firearms would likely lead to increase of car accidents due to collisions with wild animals and consequent increase in number of injuries and fatalities.
* '''Impact on state budget''': As Czech constitution does not allow confiscation without remuneration, the government would have to pay up to tens of billions Czech crowns (billions of Euros) as compensation for banned firearms. Meanwhile, rise in unemployment would further impact budget income.

Despite reservations of the Czech Republic and Poland, the Directive was adopted by majority vote of the European Council and by first reading vote with no public debate in the European Parliament. It was published in the Official Journal under No. (EU) 2017/853 on 17 May 2017. Member States will have 15 months to implement the Directive into its national legal systems. The Czech Government announced that it will lodge a suit against the directive in front of the European Court of Justice, seeking postponement of its effectiveness as well as complete invalidation,&lt;ref name="chov1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=22075645&amp;docType=ART| title=ČR podá žalobu proti směrnici EU o zbraních [CR will file suit against he European Firearms Directive] |publisher=Ministry of Interior|accessdate=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did so on 9 August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-guncontrol-czech-idUSKBN1AP1SA| title=Czechs take legal action over EU rules on gun control |publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Proposal of amendment of Constitutional Act no. 110/1998 Col., on Security of the Czech Republic lodged by 36 MPs on 6 February 2017 ''(Subsection 1 &amp; 2 are preexisting, subsection No. 3 is newly proposed in the Amendment.)''
}}

Ministry of Interior proposed a constitutional amendment on 15 December 2016 aimed at providing constitutional right to acquire, possess and carry firearms. The proposed law would, if passed, add a new section to Constitutional Act No. 110/1998 Col., on Security of the Czech Republic, expressly providing the right to be armed as part of citizen's duty of participation in provision of internal order, security and democratic order.&lt;ref name="Con am"&gt;{{Citation

According to explanatory note to the proposal, it aims at utilisation of already existing specific conditions as regards firearms ownership in the Czech Republic (2.75% of adult population having concealed carry license) for security purposes as a reaction to current threats – especially isolated attacks against [[soft target]]s. While there is constitutional right to self-defense, its practical utilization without any weapon is only illusory.&lt;ref name="Con am" /&gt;

The note further elaborates that unlike the rest of the EU, where most guns are owned for hunting, the vast majority of Czech gun owners possess firearms suitable for protection of life, health and property, explicitly mentioning, inter alia, semi-automatic rifles (which are subject to the proposed EU Gun Ban, see above).&lt;ref name="Con am" /&gt;

As regards adherence to EU law, the explanatory note states:&lt;ref name="Con am" /&gt;
* The proposal falls outside of jurisdiction of EU law, as
** Article 4(2) of [[Treaty on European Union|TEU]] respects basic functions of state, including maintenance of public order and provision of national security.
** Article 72 of [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|TFEU]] states that "This Title shall not affect the exercise of the responsibilities incumbent upon Member States with regard to the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security."
** Article 276 of TFEU: "In exercising its powers regarding the provisions of Chapters 4 and 5 of Title V of Part Three relating to the area of freedom, security and justice, the Court of Justice of the European Union shall have no jurisdiction to review (...) the exercise of the responsibilities incumbent upon Member States with regard to the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security."
* The proposal falls outside of scope of the Firearms Directive, as
** territorial authority of the proposal falls strictly within the Czech Republic
** personal authority of the proposal falls strictly on citizens of the Czech Republic and does not extend even to EU foreigners living in the country
** the proposal does not deal with acquisition of firearms for the purposes of hunting and sport shooting, which are the main areas that the Firearms Directive is concerned with

The Minister of Interior [[Milan Chovanec]] stated that he aims, due to pressing security threats, at having the proposal enacted before the autumn 2017 Czech Parliamentary Elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/423854-lide-maji-dostat-pravo-sahnout-pri-ohrozeni-statu-po-zbrani.html|title=Lidé mají dostat právo sáhnout při ohrožení státu po zbrani [People shall have the right to use firearms for protection of state]|date=15 December 2016|first=Naďa|last=Adamičková|publisher=novinky.cz|accessdate=16 December 2016|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to be armed further became a major political issue with explicit impact as regards possible future Czech-EU relationship and membership, when the Civic Democratic Party took a pledge to "defend the right of law abiding citizens to be armed even if it would mean facing EU sanctions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/drzeni-zbrani-evropska-smernice-ods-d73-/domaci.aspx?c=A170117_131834_domaci_kop|title=Budeme bránit držení zbraní, i kdyby od EU hrozily sankce, slibuje ODS [ODS pledged to defend right to be armed even if it would lead to EU sanctions]|date=17 January 2017|publisher=idnes.cz|accessdate=5 March 2017|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 February 2017, Minister Chovanec and 35 other Members of Chamber of Deputies of the [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Czech Parliament]] officially lodged proposal of the constitutional amendment with modified wording. In order to pass, the proposal must gain support of 3/5 of all Members of Chamber of Deputies (120 out of 200) and 3/5 of Senators present. Explanatory note to the proposal states that it aims at preventing significant negative impacts of proposed EU Firearms Directive amendment that would lead to transition of now legal firearms to black market. It aims to utilize to the maximum possible extent both exemptions of the Directive proposal as well as the sole authority of national law provided in the EU's primary law for issues of national security &lt;ref name="Con am2" /&gt; The legislative process continued as follows:
* 27 February 2017: the proposal was discussed by the '''[[Government of the Czech Republic]]''', showing a clear split between coalition parties as all 7 [[Czech Social Democratic Party|ČSSD]] Ministers supported the proposal, while [[ANO 2011|ANO]] and [[KDU-ČSL]] Ministers either rejected it or abstained. Lacking majority in either way, the Government didn't take any official position on the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/vlada-se-na-zakonu-ke-zbranim-neshodla-rozhodne-parlament/1454998|title=Vláda se na zákonu ke zbraním neshodla, rozhodne Parlament [Government didn't reach consensus on the firearms law, Parliament shall decide]|date=27 February 2017|publisher=ceskenoviny.cz|accessdate=20 April 2017|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legally, under the Article 44(2) of the Czech Constitution, failure to declare any opinion on a proposed act by Government means that the Government supports the proposal.&lt;ref name="gov advisory"&gt;{{Citation

The General Assembly of the United Nations approved by consensus two resolutions presented by [[Bolivia]].

This resolution recognizes that “human beings are an inseparable part of nature, and that they cannot damage it without severely damaging themselves.” It also seeks to contribute to the preparatory process for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?cat=136 |title=Rights of Mother Earth « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/president/65/initiatives/HarmonywithNature.html |title=Initiatives of the President of the 65th Session - General Assembly of the United Nations |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherearthrights.org/2009/12/22/the-united-nations-approved-the-resolution-%E2%80%9Charmony-with-nature%E2%80%9D-proposed-by-bolivia/ |title=The United Nations approved the resolution "Harmony with Nature" proposed by Bolivia « Mother Earth |publisher=Motherearthrights.org |date=2009-12-22 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?p=1975 |title=UN Approves Two More Resolutions by Bolivia / ONU aprueba dos resoluciones más propuestas por Bolivia « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date=2010-12-23 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?p=2016 |title=UN General Assembly Debates Harmony With Nature « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwccc.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/speech-by-bolivia-at-un-dialogue-on-harmony-with-nature/ |title=Speech by Bolivia at UN Dialogue on Harmony with Nature « World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth |publisher=Pwccc.wordpress.com |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of the proposal==

The proposal in its entirety, verbatim, follows.

'''Preliminary Proposal of the Plurinational State of Bolivia for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)'''

The achievement of [[sustainable development]] in the 21st Century requires a Social and Ecological Contract among human beings and our Mother Earth that brings together and builds upon the progress made in the [[World Charter for Nature]] (1982),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/37/a37r007.htm |title=A/RES/37/7. World Charter for Nature |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Rio Declaration]] (1992),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/dsd_aofw_sids/sids_pdfs/BPOA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Earth Charter]] (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ECI Sec 3 |url=http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/Read-the-Charter.html |title=Read the Charter |publisher=Earthcharterinaction.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth]] (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwccc.wordpress.com/ |title=World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth |publisher=Pwccc.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would include the following premises:

'''I. WE ARE BREAKING THE BALANCE OF THE EARTH SYSTEM'''

1. Twenty years after the “Rio Declaration,” it is necessary to update its First Principle such that it would state: “Human beings and nature are at the center of concerns for sustainable development.” It is essential to get beyond this [[anthropocentric]] vision. Not only do human beings “have the right to a healthy life,” but so too does nature, which is the basis of survival for all species including humans.

2. Nature is not just a set of resources that can be exploited, modified, altered, privatized, commercialized and transformed without any consequences. Earth is the only home we have. The Earth does not belong to us; we belong to the Earth.

3. The Earth is a living system. It is an indivisible, interdependent and interrelated community {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} human beings, nature, the atmosphere, the [[hydrosphere]], and the [[geosphere]]. Any substantive alteration of one of its components can affect other areas and the entire system. The Earth is the source of life. It is a system that coordinates physical, chemical, biological and ecological elements in a manner that makes life possible. Through the term ''[[wikt:Mother Earth|Mother Earth]]'', we express this relationship of belonging to a system and respect for our home.

4. Human activity is altering the dynamics and functioning of the Earth system to a degree never before seen. We have exceeded the limits of our system. We have broken harmony with nature. We are living through a series of rising crises that could cause the collapse of the system. It is essential to restore, affirm and guarantee the existence, integrity, interrelation, interaction and regeneration of the Earth system as a whole and of all of its components.

'''II. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY'''

5. In this century, the two central challenges of sustainable development are to overcome poverty and inequality, and to reestablish balance within the Earth system. Both objectives are intrinsically linked, and one cannot be achieved without the other.

6. It is essential to recognize and affirm that growth has limits. The pursuit of unending development on a finite planet is unsustainable and impossible. It is unsustainable and impossible. The limit to development is defined by the regenerative capacity of the Earth’s vital cycles. When growth begins to break that balance, as we see with global warming, we can no longer speak of it as development, but rather, the deterioration and destruction of our home. A certain level of growth and industrialization is needed to satisfy basic needs and guarantee the human rights of a population, but this level of “necessary development” is not about permanent growth, but rather, balance among humans and with nature.

7. Sustainable development seeks to [[eradicate poverty]] in order to live well, not generate wealthy people who live at the expense of the poor. The goal is the satisfaction of basic human needs in order to allow for the development of human capabilities and human happiness, strengthening community among human beings and with Mother Earth. In a world in which 1% of the population controls 50% of the wealth of the planet, it will not be possible to eradicate poverty or restore harmony with nature.

8. To end poverty and achieve an equitable distribution of well being, the basic resources and firms should be in the hands of the public sector and society. Only a society that controls its principal sources of income can aspire to a just distribution of the benefits needed to eliminate poverty.

9. The so-called “developed” countries must reduce their levels of over-consumption to reestablish harmony among human beings and with nature, allowing for the sustainable development of all developing countries. The ecological footprint of the developed countries is between 3 and 5 times larger than the average ecological footprint that the Earth system can sustain without an impact on its vital cycles.

10. The developing countries should follow new paradigms different from those used by developed countries in order to attend to the basic needs of their populations and reestablish harmony with nature. It is not sustainable or viable for all countries to follow the example of developed countries without causing our system to collapse.

11. Sustainable development cannot happen only at the national level. The well being of a country is only sustainable if it contributes to the well being of the entire system. The pillar of sustainable development can only be achieved from a global perspective. The so-called developed countries are still far from reaching sustainable development.

'''III. TOOLS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT'''

12. In an interdependent and interconnected system like that of Earth, we cannot recognize the rights of the human part of the system without affecting the rest of the system. To reestablish balance with nature, we must acknowledge its intrinsic value and clearly establish the obligations of humans toward nature, and also recognize that nature has rights that should be respected, promoted, and defended. Just as human beings have rights, the Mother Earth also has the right to exist, the right to maintain its vital cycles, the right to regeneration, the right to be free from structural alteration, and the right to relate to the other parts of the Earth system. Without respecting and guaranteeing the rights of nature, it is not possible to guarantee human rights and achieve sustainable development.

13. We have to end the system of consumption, waste and luxury. Millions of people are dying of hunger in the poorest parts of the globe, while in the richest areas, millions of dollars are spent to combat obesity. We must change the unsustainable patterns of consumption, production, and waste through public policy, regulations, and the conscious and active participation of society. This includes promoting ethics that value human beings for what they are, not what they have.

14. To guarantee the human right to water, education, health, communication, transportation, energy and sanitation, above all in the very poor and marginalized sectors, the provision of these services must be essentially public and based on efficient social management, not private business.

15. States should ensure the right of their populations to proper nutrition by strengthening food sovereignty policies that promote: a) food production by farmers, indigenous peoples and small agricultural producers; b) access to land, water, seeds, credit and other resources for family and community producers; c) the development of social and public enterprises for food production, distribution, and sale that prevent hoarding and contribute to the stability of food prices in domestic markets, thus halting speculative practices and the destruction of local production; d) the right of citizens to define what goods they wish to consume, the origins of those goods and how they are produced; e) consumption of what is necessary and the prioritization of local production; f) practices that contribute to reestablishing harmony with nature, avoiding greater desertification, deforestation, and destruction of biological diversity; g) the promotion of the use of indigenous seeds and traditional knowledge. Food production and commercialization must be socially regulated and cannot be left to free market forces.

16. Without water, there is no life. Humans and all living things have the [[right to water]], but water also has rights. All States and peoples worldwide should work together in solidarity to ensure that loss of vegetation, deforestation, the pollution of the atmosphere and contamination are prevented from continuing to alter the hydrological cycle. These cause [[desertification]], lack of food, temperature increase, [[sea level rise]], migrations, [[acid rain]], and physical-chemical changes that can cause ecosystems to die.

17. Forests are essential to the balance and integrity of planet Earth and a key element in the proper functioning of its ecosystems and the broader system of which we are a part. Thus we cannot consider them as simple providers of goods and services for human beings. The protection, preservation and recuperation of forests is required to reestablish the balance of the Earth system. Forests are not plantations that can be reduced to their capacity to capture carbon and provide environmental services. The maintenance of native forests and woodlands is essential for the water cycle, the atmosphere, biodiversity, the prevention of flooding, and the preservation of ecosystems. Forests are also home to indigenous peoples and communities. The preservation of forests should be pursued through integral and participatory management plans financed with public funding from developed countries.

18. It is essential to guarantee a real and effective reduction of [[greenhouse gases]], particularly on the part of the developed countries historically responsible for climate change, in order to stabilize the increase in temperature to 1&amp;nbsp;°C during this century. We must therefore strengthen the [[Kyoto Protocol]], not replace it with a more flexible voluntary agreement in which each country does what it chooses. It is necessary to eliminate carbon market mechanisms and offsets so that real domestic reductions are made within the countries with said obligations.

19. All forms of violence against women are incompatible with sustainable development, including violence done to women in militarily occupied territories and domestic or sexual violence that treats women as objects.

20. In order for sustainable development to exist, is essential to guarantee the full application of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]].

21. Under the framework of common but differentiated responsibilities established in the 1992 Rio Declaration, the so-called developed countries must assume and pay their historical [[ecological debt]] for having contributed the most to the deterioration of the Earth system. The payment of this ecological debt to developing countries and the sectors most affected among their own populations consists of the transfer financial resources from public sources and also the effective transfer of appropriate technologies required by developing countries.

22. The resources developed countries dedicate to their defense, security and war budgets should be used to address the effects of climate change and the imbalance with nature. It is inexcusable that 1.5 trillion dollars in public funding are used on these budgets, while, to address the impacts of climate change in developing countries, they want to dedicate just 100 billion dollars from public and private funds as well as market sources by 2020.

23. To address the challenge of achieving sustainable development in the so-called developing countries, a [[financial transaction tax]] should be created to help build a Sustainable Development Fund that would be managed by developing countries.

24. Sustainable development requires a new international financial architecture to replace the [[World Bank]] and the [[IMF]] with entities that are democratic and transparent, that refrain from imposing conditions or structural adjustments, are controlled by the developing countries, and are based on the principles of solidarity and complementarity rather than commercialization and privatization.

25. It is essential to promote the exchange of scientific and technical knowledge and to remove intellectual property barriers to allow a true transfer of environmentally friendly technologies from developed countries to developing countries. An effective Technology Transfer Mechanism should be created based on the need for socially, culturally, and ecologically appropriate technologies in the countries of the South. This mechanism should not be a showcase for the sale of technologies by rich countries.

26. [[Intellectual property rights]] over genes, microorganisms and other forms of life are a threat to [[food sovereignty]], [[biodiversity]], access to medicine and other basic elements of the survival of low-income populations. All forms of [[intellectual property over life]] should be abolished.

27. [[Gross Domestic Product]] is not an adequate means of measuring the development and well being of a society. Thus it is necessary to create indicators for measuring the environmental destruction caused by certain economic activities in order to advance toward sustainable development in harmony with nature, integrating social and environmental aspects that are not aimed at the commercialization of nature and its functions.

28. Respect for the [[sovereignty of States]] is essential in the management and protection of nature under the framework of cooperation among States.

29. There is no single solution for all peoples. Human beings are diverse. Our peoples have their own unique cultures and identities. To destroy a culture is to threaten the identity of an entire people. Capitalism attempts to homogenize us all to convert us into consumers. There has not been, nor will there ever be, a single model for life that can save the world. We live and act in a pluralistic world, and a pluralistic world should respect diversity, which is itself synonymous with life. Respect for peaceful and harmonious complementarity among the diverse cultures and economies, without exploitation or discrimination against any single one, is essential for saving the planet, humanity, and life.

30. Peace is essential for sustainable development. There is no worse aggression against humanity and Mother Earth than war and violence. War destroys life. Nobody and nothing is safe from war. Those that fight suffer, as do those that are forced to go without bread in order to feed the war. Wars squander life and natural resources.

31. An International Tribunal of [[Environmental justice|Environmental]] and [[Climate Justice]] must be established to judge and sanction crimes against nature that transcend national borders, violating the rights of nature and affecting humanity.

32. The problems affecting humanity and nature are global in nature, and to address them requires the exercise of global democracy through the development of mechanisms of consultation and decision-making such as referendums, plebiscites, or popular consultations so that the citizens of the world as a whole may speak.

33. Sustainable development is incompatible with all forms of imperialism and neocolonialism. It is essential to end the imposition of conditionalities, military interventions, coups and different forms of blackmail in order to stop imperialism and neocolonialism.

34. The collective global response needed to confront the crisis we face requires structural changes. We must change the system, not the climate or the Earth system. In the hands of capitalism, everything is converted into merchandise: water, earth genomes, ancestral cultures, justice, ethics, life. It is essential to develop a pluralistic system based on the culture of life and harmony among human beings and with nature; a system that promotes sustainable development in the framework of solidarity, complementarity, equity, social and economic justice, social participation, respect for diversity, and peace.

'''IV. DANGEROUS AND FALSE SOLUTIONS'''

35. Not all that glitters is gold. Not all that is labeled “green” is environmentally friendly. We must use the precautionary principle and deeply analyze the different “green” alternatives that are presented before proceeding with their experimentation and implementation.

36. Nature cannot be subject to manipulation by new technologies without consequences in the future. History shows us that many dangerous technologies have been released in the market before their environmental or health impacts are known, or before their social and economic impacts on poor people and developing countries are understood. This is currently the case with genetically modified organisms, agrochemicals, biofuels, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology. These technologies should be avoided.

37. [[Climate engineering|Geoengineering]] and all forms of artificial manipulation of the climate should be prohibited, for they bring the enormous risk of further destabilizing the climate, biodiversity and nature.

38. It is necessary to create public and multilateral mechanisms within the United Nations to evaluate in an independent manner and without conflict of interest the potential environmental, health, social, and economic impacts of new technologies before they are spread. This mechanism must involve transparency and social participation by potentially affected groups.

39. The current ecological and climate crisis has put in jeopardy all of life on planet Earth, and thus it requires deep solutions based on the real causes of the climate crisis. It cannot be reduced to a simple market failure, which is a reductionist and narrow view.

40. The solution is not to put a price on nature. Nature is not a form of capital. The green economy should not distort the fundamental principles of sustainable development. It is wrong to say that we only value that which has a price, an owner, and brings profits. The market mechanisms that permit exchange among human beings and nations have proven incapable of contributing to an equitable distribution of wealth. To use an approach based on market principles and private appropriation to try to resolve the problem of inequality – itself a product of capitalism – is like trying to put out a fire with gasoline.

41. It is wrong to fragment nature into “environmental services” with a monetary value for market exchange. It is wrong to put a price on the capacity of forests to act as [[carbon sinks]], and worse to promote their commercialization as does [[REDD]] (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). The market for carbon credits based on forests will lead to: a) noncompliance with effective emission reduction commitments by developed countries; b) the bulk of resources being appropriated by intermediaries and financial entities and rarely benefiting countries, indigenous peoples and forests themselves; c) the generation of speculative bubbles based on the sale and purchase of said certificates; and d) the establishment of new property rights over the capacity of forests to capture carbon dioxide, which will clash with the sovereign rights of States and the indigenous peoples that live in forests. To promote market mechanisms based on the economic needs of developing countries is a new form of neocolonialism.

42. [[“Green” capitalism]] will bring about natural resource grabbing, displacing humanity and nature from the essential elements needed for their survival. The drive for profit, instead of reestablishing harmony within the system, will provoke even greater imbalances, [[wealth condensation|concentrations of wealth]], and speculative processes.

'''V. GLOBAL GOVERNMENT AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION'''

43. It is necessary to establish a United Nations organization to promote sustainable development in harmony with nature. This organization should articulate and unite the different authorities involved in order to avoid overlapping efforts and achieve effective coordination. Developing countries should have majority representation in said organization, and its functioning should be democratic, transparent, and accountable.

44. This organization should articulate all of the conventions regarding nature without leaving aside issues central to the United Nations, such as water.

45. Social participation is essential in this new organization. Workers, women, farmers, indigenous peoples, young people, scientists, and all sectors of society should be represented. The private sector cannot have the same amount of influence as the social sectors, given that, by definition, its goal is to create profit rather than social wellbeing. Effective mechanisms for interaction among all social actors are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/index.php?page=view&amp;nr=212&amp;type=12&amp;menu=23&amp;template=435 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402182458/http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/index.php?page=view&amp;nr=212&amp;type=12&amp;menu=23&amp;template=435 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-04-02 |title=Rio+20 - United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development |publisher=Uncsd2012.org |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Highway Act 1835''' (5 &amp; 6 Will 4 c 50) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It was one of the [[Highway Acts 1835 to 1885]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Short Titles Act 1896]], section 2(1) and Schedule 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parish boards==
The Highway Act 1835 placed [[highway]]s under the direction of [[parish surveyors]], and allowed them to pay for the costs involved by [[rates (tax)|rates]] levied on the occupiers of land. The surveyor's duty is to keep the highways in repair, and if a highway is out of repair, the surveyor may be summoned before the courts and ordered to complete the repairs within a limited time. The surveyor is also charged with the removal of nuisances on the highway. A highway nuisance may be abated by any person, and may be made the subject of indictment at [[common law]].

The board consists of representatives of the various parishes, called "way wardens" together with the justices for the county residing within the district. Salaries and similar expenses incurred by the board are charged on a district fund to which the several parishes contribute; but each parish remains separately responsible for the expenses of maintaining its own highways.

The amending acts, while not interfering with the operation of the principal act, authorize the creation of highway districts on a larger scale. The justices of a county may convert it or any portion of it into a highway district to be governed by a highway board, the powers and responsibilities of which will be the same as those of the parish surveyor under the former act.

==New road offences==
The Highway Act 1835 specified as offences for which the driver of a carriage on the public highway might be punished by a fine, in addition to any civil action that might be brought against him:

*Riding upon the cart, or upon any horse drawing it, and not having some other person to guide it, unless there be some person driving it.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;[[#opsi1835|The Highway Act 1835]], section 78: "That if the Driver of any Drivers of Waggon, Cart, or other Carriage of any Kind shall ride upon any such Carriage, or upon any Horse or Horses drawing the same, on any Highway, not having some other Person on Foot or on Horseback unless some to guide the same (such Carriages and Carts as are driven with Reins, other Person and are conducted by some Person holding the Reins of all the Horses guide them. drawing the same, excepted)"&lt;/ref&gt;
*Negligence causing damage to person or goods being conveyed on the highway&lt;ref name=p78 group="n"&gt;[[#opsi1835|The Highway Act 1835]], section 78&lt;/ref&gt;
*Quitting his cart, or leaving control of the horses, or leaving the cart so as to be an obstruction on the highway.&lt;ref name=p78 group="n"/&gt;
*Not having the owner's name painted up.&lt;ref name=p76 group="n"&gt;[[#opsi1835|The Highway Act 1835]], section 76&lt;/ref&gt;
*Refusing to give the same.&lt;ref name=p76 group="n"/&gt;
*Driving animals or a 'carriage of any description' on the [[Sidewalk|footway]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;[[#opsi1835|The Highway Act 1835]], section 72: "If any person shall wilfully ride upon any footpath or causeway by the side of any road made or set apart for the use or accommodation of foot passengers; or shall wilfully lead or drive any horse, ass, sheep, mule, swine, or cattle or carriage of any description, or any truck or sledge, upon any such footpath or causeway; or shall tether any horse, ass, mule, swine, or cattle, on any highway, so as to suffer or permit the tethered animal to be thereon." (Section 72 - see below for details)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Not keeping on the left or near side of the road, when meeting any other carriage or horse. This rule does not apply in the case of a carriage meeting a foot-passenger, but a driver is bound to use due care to avoid driving against any person crossing the highway on foot. At the same time a passenger crossing the highway is also bound to use due care in avoiding vehicles, and the mere fact of a driver being on the wrong side of the road would not be evidence of negligence in such a case.&lt;ref name=p78 group="n"/&gt;
*The playing of [[football]] on public highways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/originsofrugby.htm|title=Origins of Rugby|work=Rugby Football History|accessdate=2010-04-14|quote="football for the common man was being suppressed, notably by the 1835 Highways Act which forbade the playing of football on highways and public land - which is where most games took place"}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a maximum penalty of forty [[shillings]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;[[#opsi1835|The Highway Act 1835]], section 72 (since repealed)&lt;br&gt;if any person [...] shall play at Foot-ball or any other Game on any Part of the said Highways, to the Annoyance of any Passenger or Passengers [... shall] pay any Sum not exceeding Forty Shillings&lt;/ref&gt;

==Section 72==
Section 72 provides: "''If any person shall wilfully ride upon any footpath or causeway by the side of any road made or set apart for the use or accommodation of foot passengers; or shall wilfully lead or drive any horse, ass, sheep, mule, swine, or cattle or carriage of any description, or any truck or sledge, upon any such footpath or causeway; or shall tether any horse, ass, mule, swine, or cattle, on any highway, so as to suffer or permit the tethered animal to be thereon.''"

This clause is referred to by the current [[Highway Code]]:
*Rule 64, 2005: "You MUST NOT cycle on a pavement." 2005
*Rule 145, 1988: "You MUST NOT drive on or over a pavement, footpath or bridleway except to gain lawful access to property, or in the case of an emergency." (The offence of driving on a bridleway is covered by a later act)1988
*Rule 157, 1973: "[A non-road legal] vehicle MUST NOT be used on roads, pavements, footpaths or bridleways." (The [[Department for Transport]] cited this section in 2006 when it ruled that [[Segway PT|Segway]]s could not be legally used on [[sidewalk|pavements]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/vehicles/vssafety/regulationsforselfbalancings4565|title = Regulations for Self-balancing Scooters|publisher=Department for Transport|quote=Under the Highway Act 1835 no-one may ride or drive on the footway. Certain vehicles used by disabled drivers are exempted from these requirements but only where they use Class 2 or Class 3 "invalid carriages". These vehicles are restricted to a speed of 4 mph on the footway and, apart from those involved in the demonstration, training or repair of these vehicles, the users must have a physical disability. Self-balancing scooters are not classified as "invalid carriages" so cannot be used on pavements.|accessdate=2010-03-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202041311/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/vehicles/vssafety/regulationsforselfbalancings4565 |archivedate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;) 1973

==Related and subsequent acts==
The [[Public Health Act 1875]] vested the powers and duties of surveyors of highways and vestries in urban authorities,

The [[Local Government Act 1888]] the entire maintenance of main roads was thrown upon [[county council]]s.

The [[Local Government Act 1894]] transferred to the [[Districts of England|district councils]] of every rural district all the powers of [[rural sanitary district|rural sanitary authorities]] and [[highway authority|highway authorities]].

The '''International Organisation of Securities Commissions''' ('''IOSCO''') is an association of organisations that regulate the world’s [[securities]] and [[Futures contract|futures]] markets. Members are typically primary securities and/or futures regulators in a national jurisdiction or the main financial regulator from each country. Its mandate is to:&lt;ref name="eiu"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Road to Action: Financial regulation addressing climate change|date=2017|publisher=Economist Intelligence Unit|location=London|url=http://www.eiuperspectives.economist.com/sites/default/files/LON%20-%20RF%20-%20report%20on%20climate%20change%20WEB_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Develop, implement, and promote high standards of regulation to enhance investor protection and reduce systemic risk
* Share information with exchanges and assist them with technical and operational issues
* Establish standards toward monitoring global investment transactions across borders and markets

IOSCO has members from over 100 different countries, who regulate more than 95% of the world's securities markets. It has a permanent secretariat in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

==History==
IOSCO was born in 1983 from the transformation of its ancestor the "Inter-American Regional Association" (created in 1974) into a truly global cooperative. This decision to expand the organisation beyond the Americas was made at the annual gathered in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]], in April 1983.  At the same time, the organisation was renamed to IOSCO to reflect the expanded membership beyond North and South America. Securities regulators from [[France]], [[Indonesia]], [[Korea]], and the [[United Kingdom]] were the first agencies to join from outside the Americas. The IOSCO July 1986 Paris Annual Conference was the first to take place outside of the American continents and on that occasion a decision was made to create a permanent General Secretariat for the Organisation.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; One remnant of its early inter-American roots is that IOSCO's "official" languages are English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese.

In 1998 IOSCO started work on a number of important policies that led to broader set of guidelines. However it was the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] as well as a series of large global financial scandals that started with [[Enron]] and including [[Worldcom]], [[Parmalat]], and [[Vivendi]] that brought urgency to this work and heralded IOSCO's evolution from an international “talk shop”, where little of substance was accomplished, to a serious international organisation with a real impact on the securities regulation. At the 1999 conference in [[Lisbon]], it was decided to have a permanent headquarters for the administrative General Secretariat and that it should be based in Madrid.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

In 2002 IOSCO adopted a multilateral memorandum of understanding (IOSCO MMoU) designed to facilitate crossborder enforcement and exchange of information among the international community of securities regulators. Then in 2005 IOSCO MMoU become the benchmark for international cooperation among securities regulators.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

As of February 2018, IOSCO had 218 members.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About IOSCO|url=https://www.iosco.org/about/?subsection=about_iosco|website=IOSCO|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOSCO members are divided into three main categories:

*Ordinary members: primary securities and/or [[Futures contract|futures]] markets regulators in a jurisdiction. A [[stock exchange]] or [[self-regulatory organization]] may be an ordinary member, but only if it is the jurisdiction’s primary securities regulator. Each ordinary member has one vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosco.org/about/index.cfm?section=categories |title= IOSCO Categories &amp; Contributions of Members |author=IOSCO }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Associate members: other securities and/or futures regulators in cases where there's more than one per jurisdiction. For example, the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC) and the [[North American Securities Administrators Association]] in the United States are associate members of IOSCO given that the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] is the ordinary member from the United States. Associate members have no vote and are not eligible for the Executive Committee; they are, however, members of the Presidents' Committee.
*Affiliate members: include stock exchanges, self-regulatory organisations, and various stock market industry associations. Affiliate members have no vote, are not eligible for the Executive Committee, and are not members of the Presidents' Committee. Affiliate members that are self-regulatory organizations (SROs), are, however, members of the SRO Consultative Committee.

== Structure ==
The organisation is made up of a number of committees that meet several times a year at different locations around the world supported by a permanent administrative General Secretariat.

===Leadership===
Administratively, IOSCO is run by a General Secretariat based in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. IOSCO’s current Secretary General is Paul P. Andrews, who started his renewable three-year term in March 2016. Previously, he served as the Vice President and Managing Director of [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA) a [[self-regulatory organization]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paul P. Andrews of FINRA Named IOSCO Secretary General|url=https://www.iosco.org/news/pdf/IOSCONEWS409.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2018|work=IOSCO|date=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOSCO Board is IOSCO's governing and standard-setting body. It is composed of 33 securities regulators; [[Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission]] CEO Ashley Ian Alder is the IOSCO Board Chair (he also chairs the Asia-Pacific Regional Committee). He is supported by two Vice Chairs, Ranjit Ajit Singh, Chair of the [[Securities Commission Malaysia]] (who chairs the Growth and Emerging Markets Committee, IOSCO's largest sub-committee) and Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of [[Belgium]]'s [[Financial Services and Markets Authority (Belgium)|Financial Services and Markets Authority]] (who chairs the European Regional Committee as well).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosco.org/about/index.cfm?section=structure |title=About IOSCO – Structure |author=IOSCO }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional committees===
IOSCO has four regional committees:
* African-Middle East Regional Committee: chaired by Mounir Gwarzo of the [[Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission]]
* Asia-Pacific Regional Committee: chaired by Ashley Ian Alder of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission
* European Regional Committee: chaired by Jean-Paul Servais of the Belgium Financial Services and Markets Authority
* Inter-American Regional Committee: chaired by Jaime González Aguadé of the [[Mexico]]'s [[Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores]]

===Technical Committee===
The Technical Committee has been described as the one involving the most "grunt work". In short, it is made up of 16 of the larger securities agencies that regulate more developed markets. It is "self-constituting" in the sense that it determines which countries will be a member and it also determines procedures and agendas.&lt;ref name="law"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. A. Sommer, Jr.|title=IOSCO: Its Mission and Achievement|journal=Northwestern Journal of International Law &amp; Business|date=1996|volume=17|issue=1|pages=15–29|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1441&amp;context=njilb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, former [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] Chairman [[Richard C. Breeden]] was elected Chair of the technical committee and implemented reforms that gave it a "new vigor and a new resolution" that "bespoke an organization confident of its footing and its mission".&lt;ref name="law"/&gt;

== External cooperation ==
IOSCO is a member of, participates as an observer in, or coordinates with a number of other organisations. One of its most important relationships is with the [[Joint Forum]] of international financial regulators. IOSCO, along with the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] and the [[International Association of Insurance Supervisors]], make up the Joint Forum.

The IOSCO MOUs are considered the primary instruments to facilitate crossborder cooperation, reduce global systemic risk, protect investors, and ensure fair and efficient securities markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD126.pdf |title=Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Consultation and Co-operation and the Exchange of Information | date= May 2002 |author=IOSCO }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosco.org/library/index.cfm?section=mou_siglist |title=List of Signatories to the IOSCO Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding | author=IOSCO }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, IOSCO is a member of, participates as an observer in, or coordinates with a number of other international organisations, including the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[Financial Stability Board|FSB]], [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]], [[International Accounting Standards Board|IASB]], [[Public Interest Oversight Board|PIOB]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[World Bank]], and [[European Commission]].

== Policies ==
IOSCO adopted in 1998 a comprehensive set of ''Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation'' (IOSCO Principles).  These continue to be developed and expanded. IOSCO recommends all its members to adopt these and helps its members assess the level of compliance with the principles.  These include;

*Regulatory principles designed to improve auditor independence and auditor oversight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD134.pdf |title=Principles for Auditor Oversight |publisher = IOSCO Technical Committee | date= Oct 2002 |author=IOSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''International Securities Identification Number''' ('''ISIN''') uniquely identifies a [[security (finance)|security]]. Its structure is defined in [[ISO 6166]]. The ISIN code is a 12-character alphanumeric code that serves for uniform identification of a security through normalization of the assigned National Number, where one exists, at trading and [[settlement (finance)|settlement]].

==History==
ISINs were first used in 1981, but didn't reach wide acceptance until 1989, when the [[Group of Thirty|G30 countries]] recommended adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/cpis/2002/pdf/cpis_index.pdf|title=Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey Guide, Second Edition, International Monetary Fund, 2002, Washington DC - Appendix VII: International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) Code System|author=|date=|website=imf.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614080658/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/cpis/2002/pdf/cpis_index.pdf|archivedate=2017-06-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISIN was endorsed a year later by ISO with the ISO 6166 standard.

Initially information was distributed via [[CD-ROM]]s and this was later replaced by distribution over the internet.

In 2004 the European Union mandated the use of instrument identifiers in some of its regulatory reporting, which included ISIN as one of the valid identifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2004/809/oj/eng|title=Commission Regulation (EC) No 809/2004 of 29 April 2004 implementing Directive 2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards information contained in prospectuses as well as the format, incorporation by reference and publication of such prospectuses and dissemination of advertisements (Text with EEA relevance)|author=|date=|website=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

''[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 6166'' (or ISO6166:2013 as of the 2013 revision) defines the structure of an International Securities Identification Number (ISIN). An ISIN uniquely identifies a [[Security (finance)#Fungible and non-fungible security|fungible security]].

Securities with which ISINs can be used are:
*[[Stock|Equities]] (shares, units, depository receipts)
*[[fixed income|Debt instruments]] ([[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and debt instruments other than international, international bonds and debt instruments, stripped coupons and principal, treasury bills, others)
*Entitlements ([[Pre-emption right|rights]], [[Warrant (finance)|warrants]])
*[[Derivative (finance)|Derivatives]] ([[Option (finance)|options]], [[Futures contract|futures]])
*Others (commodities, currencies, indices, interest rates)

ISINs consist of two alphabetic characters, which are the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code for the issuing country, nine alpha-numeric characters (the [[National Securities Identifying Number]], or NSIN, which identifies the security, padded as necessary with leading zeros), and one numerical [[check digit]]. They are thus always 12 characters in length. When the NSIN changes due to corporate actions or other reasons, the ISIN will also change. Issuance of ISINs is decentralized to individual [[national numbering agencies]] (NNAs). Since existing national numbering schemes administered by the various NNAs form the basis for ISINs, the methodology for assignment is not consistent across agencies globally.

An ISIN cannot specify a particular trading location, or another identifier, typically a [[Market Identifier Code|MIC]] ([[Market Identifier Code]]) or the three-letter exchange code, will have to be specified in addition to the ISIN. The currency of the trade will also be required to uniquely identify the instrument using this method.

== Usage and acceptance ==

Since 1989, when ISINs were introduced, they have slowly gained traction worldwide in their usage.

ISINs are being introduced worldwide and are the most popular global securities identifier. Trading, clearing and settlement systems in many countries have adopted ISINs as a secondary measure of identifying securities. Some countries, mainly in Europe, have moved to using the ISIN as their primary means of identifying securities. In addition new European regulations such as [[Solvency II Directive 2009|Solvency II]] increasingly require the ISIN to be reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dev.eiopa.europa.eu/Taxonomy/Full/2.0.1/EIOPA_XBRL_Filing_Rules_for_Solvency_II_reporting_2.0.1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007121238/https://dev.eiopa.europa.eu/Taxonomy/Full/2.0.1/EIOPA_XBRL_Filing_Rules_for_Solvency_II_reporting_2.0.1.pdf |archivedate=2016-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial model==

The ISIN is generally included in services sold by [[financial data vendors]] and intermediaries. These services are normally paid services as more value added data is included with the information. In general, the issuer of a security will include the ISIN in issuance papers or other documentation for identification purposes.

== Controversy ==
In 2009, [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] was formally charged by the [[European Commission]] (EC) with abusing its position in licensing international securities identification codes for United States [[securities]] by requiring European [[financial firm]]s and data vendors to pay licensing fees for their use. "This behaviour amounts to unfair pricing", the EC said in its statement of objections which lays the groundwork for an adverse finding against S&amp;P. "The (numbers) are indispensable for a number of operations that financial institutions carry out&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; for instance, reporting to authorities or clearing and settlement&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and cannot be substituted”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2011, Standard and Poor's provided [http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/cases/dec_docs/39592/39592_2152_5.pdf six undertakings] to the European Commission to remedy the situation. The agreement is applicable to all consuming companies in the [[European Economic Area]]. These expired at the end of 2016.

== Examples ==

The examples below describes one approach for applying the [[Luhn algorithm]] on two different ISINs. The difference in the two examples has to do with if there are an odd or even number of digits after converting letters to number. Since the NSIN element can be any alpha numeric sequence (9 characters), an odd number of letters will result in an even number of digits and an even number of letters will result in an odd number of digits. For an odd number of digits, the approach in the first example is used. For an even number of digits, the approach in the second example is used. The [[Luhn algorithm]] can also be applied in the same manner for both types or lengths (alternating multiply the string of digits by 1 and 2, starting from the end of the string), being more generic.

=== Apple, Inc. ===

[[Apple inc|Apple, Inc.]]: ISIN '''US0378331005''', expanded from [[CUSIP]] '''037833100'''
The main body of the ISIN is the original CUSIP, assigned in the 1970s. The country code "US" has been added on the front, and an additional check digit at the end. The country code indicates the country of issue. The check digit is calculated using the [[Luhn algorithm]].

Convert any letters to numbers:

U = 30, S = 28. US037833100 -&gt; 30 28 037833100 

Collect odd and even characters:

3028037833100 = (3, 2, 0, 7, 3, 1, 0), (0, 8, 3, 8, 3, 0)

Multiply the group containing the rightmost character (which is the '''FIRST''' group) by 2:

(6, 4, 0, 14, 6, 2, 0)

Add up the individual digits:

(6 + 4 + 0 + (1 + 4) + 6 + 2 + 0) + (0 + 8 + 3 + 8 + 3 + 0) = 45

Take the 10s modulus of the sum:

45 mod 10 = 5

Subtract from 10:

10 - 5 = 5

Take the 10s modulus of the result (this final step is important in the instance where the modulus of the sum is 0, as the resulting check digit would be 10).

5 mod 10 = 5

So the ISIN check digit is five.

=== Treasury Corporation of Victoria ===

TREASURY CORP VICTORIA 5 3/4% 2005-2016: ISIN '''AU0000XVGZA3'''.
The check digit is calculated using the [[Luhn algorithm]].

Convert any letters to numbers:

A = 10, G = 16, U = 30, V = 31, X = 33, Z = 35. AU0000XVGZA -&gt; 10 30 0000 33 31 16 35 10.

Collect odd and even characters:

103000003331163510 = (1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1), (0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 6, 5, 0)

Multiply the group containing the rightmost character (which is the '''SECOND''' group) by 2:

(0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2, 12, 10, 0)

Add up the individual digits:

(1 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1) + (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 2 + (1 + 2) + (1 + 0) + 0) = 27

Take the 10s modulus of the sum:

27 mod 10 = 7

Subtract from 10:

10 - 7 = 3

Take the 10s modulus of the result (this final step is important in the instance where the modulus of the sum is 0, as the resulting check digit would be 10).

3 mod 10 = 3

So the ISIN check digit is three.

=== BAE Systems ===

[[BAE Systems]]: ISIN '''GB0002634946''', expanded from SEDOL '''000263494'''

The main body is the [[SEDOL]], padded on the front with the addition of two zeros. The country code "GB" is then added on the front, and the check digit on the end as in the example above.

==Check-digit flaw in ISIN==

The Treasury Corporation of Victoria ISIN illustrates a flaw in ISIN's check digit algorithm which allows transposed letters: Suppose the ISIN was mis-typed as AU0000'''VX'''GZA3 (instead of AU0000'''XV'''GZA3)

A = 10, G = 16, U = 30, V = 31, X = 33, Z = 35. "AU0000VXGZA" -&gt; 10 30 00 00 31 33 16 35 10".

Collect odd and even characters:

103000003133163510 = (1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1), (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 6, 5, 0)

Multiply the group containing the rightmost character (which is the '''SECOND''' group) by 2:

(0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 12, 10, 0)

Add up the individual digits:

(1 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1) + (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 6 + (1 + 2) + (1 + 0) + 0) = 27

Take the 10s modulus of the sum:

27 mod 10 = 7

Subtract from 10:

10 - 7 = 3

Take the 10s modulus of the result (this final step is important in the instance where the modulus of the sum is 0, as the resulting check digit would be 10).

3 mod 10 = 3

So the ISIN check digit is ''still'' three '''even though two letters have been transposed'''.

Such flaw against a single transposed pair of letters or digits would have been avoided using two check digits instead of just one (i.e., a 97 modulus instead of the 10 modulus, like in [[International Bank Account Number|IBAN]] numbers which may also mix letters and digits). Some protocols require the transmission of additional check digits added to the full ISIN number.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7200">'''Krebiozen''' (aka '''Carcalon''', '''creatine''', '''substance X''', or '''drug X''') is a [[List of unproven and disproven cancer treatments|disproven cancer treatment]] that is made available as an [[alternative cancer treatment]]. While the substance has been marketed as a cure for cancer, originally sold for thousands of dollars per dose in the 1950s and early 1960s, Krebiozen is not known to possess any therapeutic value. Attempts to analyze its composition have shown that Krebiozen consists only of the [[amino acid]] [[creatine]] dissolved in [[mineral oil]], and some samples sold as Krebiozen consist solely of mineral oil with no other discernible ingredients.&lt;ref name="Time1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quackwatch"/&gt;

The [[American Cancer Society]] states: "Available scientific evidence does not support claims that Krebiozen is effective in treating cancer or any other disease."  According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), creatine has been linked to several dangerous side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |title=Krebiozen |date=1 November 2008 |access-date=1 June 2017 |url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/pharmacologicalandbiologicaltreatment/krebiozen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and evaluation ==
Krebiozen was initially promoted by Stevan Durovic, a [[Yugoslavia]]n physician who claimed that the substance came from horse serum inoculated with ''[[Actinomyces bovis]]''.&lt;ref name="Time1"/&gt; Durovic claimed that Krebiozen had been useful in the treatment of cancer, mainly in cats and dogs. His claims were backed by [[Andrew Conway Ivy]], a prominent physiologist, and by several politicians including [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Paul Douglas]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Illinois|IL]]).&lt;ref name="Time1"/&gt; Ivy became convinced that Krebiozen possessed anti-cancer properties,&lt;ref name=BCCA&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/PPI/UnconventionalTherapies/Krebiozen.htm |title = Krebiozen | publisher = British Columbia Cancer Agency | date = February 2000 | accessdate = 2008-10-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416120729/http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/PPI/UnconventionalTherapies/Krebiozen.htm | archivedate = 2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; administered the substance to himself and colleagues, then to a dog, and eventually started testing Krebiozen on patients.&lt;ref name=Quackwatch&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/krebiozen.html | title = The Krebiozen Story |publisher = [[Quackwatch]] | last = Holland | first = James | date = 1966-10-07 | accessdate= 2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivy called a [[press conference]] in 1951 at which he announced to an audience of journalists, politicians, doctors and potential investors that Krebiozen was a success. At the press conference, Ivy claimed that of 22 treated patients, 14 were alive and none had died of cancer. However, in reality 10 of the treated patients had died&amp;mdash;all of cancer&amp;mdash;at the time of the press conference.&lt;ref name=Quackwatch/&gt; Shortly afterward, the Krebiozen Research Foundation was established by the Durovic brothers, with Ivy as president.

Intrigued by Ivy's announcement, 10 hospitals and cancer research centers followed up on the trial and attempted to [[reproducibility|reproduce]] Ivy's claimed results. None of these independent researchers observed any effect of Krebiozen on cancer. A compilation of these institutions' negative data was reported in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=STATUS report on &amp;quot;krebiozen&amp;quot; |journal=J Am Med Assoc |volume=147 |issue=9 |pages=864&amp;ndash;73 |date=October 1951 |pmid=14873580 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krebiozen's backers responded by [[conspiracy theory|alleging a conspiracy]] against the drug.&lt;ref name=Quackwatch/&gt; In 1959, Ivy began producing his own version of the drug under the name "Carcalon".&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt;

On October 28, 1964, the Durovics, Ivy and the Krebiozen Research Foundation were indicted for introducing mislabeled drugs into interstate commerce in violation of the [[Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]]. After a 9-month trial, the case ended with a [[hung jury]] and they were acquitted.&lt;ref name=Quackwatch/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time2"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842474,00.html |title=The Krebiozen Verdict |date=1966-11-02 |accessdate=2014-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222005152/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C842474%2C00.html |archivedate=February 22, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, Durovic was indicted for tax evasion and fled the United States.&lt;ref name="ACS"/&gt;

In order to evaluate Durovic's and Ivy's claims, the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) requested samples of Krebiozen. These were provided on two occasions to the NCI and one occasion to the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). Durovic proposed to charge the NCI $170,000 per gram of Krebiozen, although ultimately the samples were provided free of charge. However, the FDA spectrophotometry team, led by [[Alma Levant Hayden]], proved the samples consisted only of [[creatine monohydrate]], a simple [[amino acid]], sometimes dissolved in [[mineral oil]].&lt;ref name=Time1&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,896964,00.html |title=Krebiozen Analyzed |date=1963-09-13 |access-date=2014-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222085943/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C896964%2C00.html |archivedate=December 22, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Quackwatch/&gt;&lt;ref name=BCCA/&gt;&lt;ref name=ACS&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3X_Krebiozen.asp?sitearea=ETO | title = Krebiozen | publisher = [[American Cancer Society]] | date = 20 July 2007 | access-date = 1 June 2017 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081029032207/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3X_Krebiozen.asp?sitearea=ETO | archivedate = 29 October 2008 | df =  }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="St Louis Dispatch 1963"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loory|first1=Stuart H.|title=Student found clue to Krebiozen identity shortly after starting work on 20,000 spectrographs|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/142117312/|access-date=7 May 2017|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=8 September 1963|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the FDA went back to test previously acquired samples of Krebiozen, they found that many lacked even creatine, and consisted solely of mineral oil with no discernible [[active ingredient]]s.&lt;ref name="Quackwatch"/&gt;

{{Politics of the United Kingdom}}
The '''Legislatures of the United Kingdom''' are derived from a number of different sources from both within the UK and through membership of the [[European Union]]. The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;Section 2 of [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&amp;PageNumber=84&amp;NavFrom=2&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1080244&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1080244&amp;filesize=4238 The Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (17 Geo. V c. 4)&lt;/ref&gt; is the supreme [[Legislature|legislative body]] for the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[British overseas territories]] with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each having their own devolved legislatures. Each of the three major [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s of the United Kingdom ([[England and Wales]], [[Scotland]]  and [[Northern Ireland]]) has its own [[laws]] and [[legal system]].

==United Kingdom legislature==

===The Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland===
[[File:Palace of Westminster - Clock Tower and New Palace Yard from the west - 240404.jpg|thumbnail|right|140px|alt=Sand-coloured building of Gothic design with large clock-tower.|The UK Parliament meets at the [[Palace of Westminster]] in [[London]].]]

{{main|Parliament of the United Kingdom}}
{{seealso|Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Government of the United Kingdom|Local government in England| Act of Parliament (UK)|Statutory instrument (UK)|UK Law|English Law|Reserved and excepted matters}}
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (commonly known as the UK Parliament, the British Parliament, the Westminster Parliament or "Westminster") is the supreme legislative body for the United Kingdom and also for English Law. It alone possesses [[Parliamentary sovereignty|legislative supremacy]] and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories. Its head is the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Sovereign of the United Kingdom]] (currently [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]) and its seat is the [[Palace of Westminster]] in [[Westminster]], [[London]].

The United Kingdom Legislation may take the form of [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]]s (passed directly by Parliament) or [[Statutory Instrument]]s, made under the authority of an Act of Parliament by either a [[Minister (government)|government minister]] or by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Queen-in-Council]]. The latter are generally subject either to parliamentary approval (affirmative procedure) or parliamentary disallowance (negative procedure). The majority of Acts considered in the UK are defined as public general acts, or 'Acts of Parliament' as they will have progressed and gained approval as a Bill through both House of Commons and House of Lords, and also have gained Royal Assent from the Monarch. [[Local and personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Local and Personal Acts of Parliament]] are also presented to Parliament as a result of sponsored petitions. These, however, are processed through committees to enable relevant or affected parties to challenge or change the proposed Act.   [[Prerogative instrument]]s, made by the Sovereign under the [[royal prerogative]] are another source of UK-wide legislation.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}. The UK Parliament is responsible for all matters relating to defence and all foreign affairs and relations with international organisations,  particularly the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and the [[European Union]].

With there being no devolved legislature in [[England]] the UK Parliament is also the supreme body for its governance, legislation, public bodies and local government.

====House of Commons====
{{Seealso|House of Commons of the United Kingdom}}
The House of Commons is the lower house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and is an elected chamber consisting currently of 650 members known as [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) which are elected using [[First-past-the-post voting|First past the post]] in single-member [[United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies|constituencies]] with 533 elected from [[England]], 59 from [[Scotland]], 40 from [[Wales]] and 18 from [[Northern Ireland]]. 

The House of Commons is now considered to be the supreme chamber of Parliament.

====House of Lords====
{{Seealso|House of Lords of the United Kingdom}}
The House of Lords is the upper house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom however it is an unelected chamber with all members to the House of Lords being appointed. As of August 2018, there are currently 793 members known as "Peers". The House of Lords no longer has the same powers as the House of Commons under the [[Parliament Acts|Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949]] especially when it comes to blocking general legislation and the passing of financial legislation.

===The Scottish Parliament===

{{main|Scottish Parliament}}
{{See also|First Minister of Scotland|Scottish Government|Local government in Scotland|Act of the Scottish Parliament|Scottish statutory instrument|Scots Law}}
The [[Scottish Parliament]] is the national, [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature of [[Scotland]], located in the [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]] area of the capital, [[Edinburgh]]. The Parliament, informally referred to as "Holyrood",&lt;ref name="HolyroodName"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/education/resources/teachingResources/wordBank.htm |title=Scottish Parliament Word Bank |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=14 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051203012812/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/education/resources/teachingResources/wordBank.htm |archivedate=3 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a democratically elected body comprising 129 members known as [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Members of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSPs). Of these 73 MSPs are elected using [[First-past-the-post voting|First past the post]] in single member constituencies and a further 56 MSPs are elected using the [[D'Hondt method]], a form of party-list proportional representation in eight additional member regions with each region electing 7 MSPs.

The Scottish Parliament was convened by the [[Scotland Act 1998]], which sets out its powers as a [[devolution|devolved]] legislature. The Act delineates the legislative competence of the Parliament{{spaced ndash}}the areas in which it can make [[Scots law|laws]]{{spaced ndash}}by explicitly specifying powers that are "[[reserved matters|reserved]]" to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]: all matters that are not explicitly reserved are automatically the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament.&lt;ref name="SpecifiedReservations"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/80046--t.htm#sch5 |title=Scotland Act 1998: Scottish Parliament Reserved Issues |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) |accessdate=14 November 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070519074917/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/80046--t.htm#sch5 |archivedate =19 May 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the Scottish Parliament, and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws.&lt;ref&gt;Murkens, Jones &amp; Keating (2002) pp11&lt;/ref&gt; The first meeting of the new Parliament took place on 12 May 1999.&lt;ref name="FirstMeeting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-99/or010104.htm#Col7 |title=Scottish Parliament Official Report – 12 May 1999 |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=5 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226162954/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-99/or010104.htm#Col7 |archivedate=26 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Statutory Instrument]]s made by the [[Scottish Government]] are another source of legislation. As with Statutory Instruments made by the British government, these are generally subject to either approval or disallowance by the Scottish Parliament

===The National Assembly for Wales===
[[File:Senedd, Welsh parliament, Cardiff Bay.jpg|thumb|right|160px|The Welsh Assembly meets in [[Cardiff]]]]    
[[File:Map of Wales within the United Kingdom.svg|right|120px]]
{{Main|National Assembly for Wales}}
{{See also|First Minister of Wales|Welsh Government|Local government in Wales|Act of the National Assembly for Wales|Welsh Law}}
The National Assembly for Wales has the power to make legislation in Wales. The Assembly was created by the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]], which followed a [[Wales referendum 1997|referendum]] in 1997. It is a  democratically elected body with 60 members known as [[Member of the National Assembly for Wales|Assembly Members]] (AMs). Of these 40 AMs are elected using [[First-past-the-post voting|First past the post]] in single member constituencies and a further 20 MSPs are elected using the [[D'Hondt method]], a form of party-list proportional representation in five additional member regions with each region electing 4 AMs. The Assembly had no powers to initiate [[primary legislation]] until limited law-making powers were gained through the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]]. Its primary law-making powers were enhanced following a Yes vote in the [[Welsh devolution referendum, 2011|referendum]] on 3 March 2011, making it possible for it to [[Act of the National Assembly for Wales|legislate]] in the 20 areas that are devolved without having to consult the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]], nor the [[Secretary of State for Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-12648649 | work=BBC News | title=Wales says Yes in referendum vote | date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly may also delegate authority to enact legislation through Welsh Statutory Instruments. Under the [[Wales Act 2017]] the Assembly came into line with Scotland and Northern Ireland and moved to a resevered powers model. 

It is expected that the National Assembly for Wales will be renamed the "Welsh Parliament" before the next scheduled election in 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-36719473|title=Welsh Assembly should change its name, agree AMs|date=2016-07-05|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-06-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Northern Ireland Assembly===

[[File:Map of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom.svg|right|120px]]
{{Main|Northern Ireland Assembly}}
{{Seealso|First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland Executive|Local government in Northern Ireland|Act of the Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland Law}}
The Northern Ireland Assembly is the [[devolution|devolved]] legislature of [[Northern Ireland]] which is a democratically elected body comprising 90 members known as [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (Northern Ireland)|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs). The 90 MLAs are elected using the [[single transferable vote]] across the 18 [[List of parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland|Westminster Parliamentary constituencies]] with each constituency electing 5 MLAs. It was established in 1998 as part of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] which was approved by the public in [[Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement referendum, 1998|referendums which were held in both Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland]]. It has power to legislate in a wide range of areas that are not explicitly [[Reserved matters|reserved]] to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and to appoint the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]. It sits at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings]] at [[Stormont, Belfast|Stormont]] in [[Belfast]]. Legislation of the Assembly empowers the Northern Ireland Executive to issue [[Statutory Rules of Northern Ireland|Statutory Rules]] in a variety of areas.

The Assembly has not met since 26 January 2017 owing to a breakdown of trust which brought down both the Assembly and Executive.

==European Union==
{{Politics of the European Union}}

{{main|European Union}}
{{seealso|Council of the European Union|European Commission|Decision (European Union law)|Directive (European Union law)|Regulation (European Union law)}}
As a [[Member state of the European Union|member state]] of the [[European Union]] (EU) under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]] the decisions, directives and regulations of the EU are directly applicable with full legal force in the United Kingdom and is also supreme to all domestic legislation, in effect another source of UK legislation. The United Kingdom became a member when it joined what was originally known as the [[European Communities]] on 1 January 1973.

Currently the United Kingdom is [[Brexit negotiations|negotiating]] its [[Brexit|exit]] from the  organisation and its institutions following a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum in 2016]] which resulted in a narrow majority vote in favour of leaving and is expected to officially leave on 30 March 2019.

'''Martha Albertson Fineman''' (born 1943) is an American jurist, [[legal theory|legal theorist]] and [[political philosophy|political philosopher]]. She is [[Robert W. Woodruff Professor]] of Law at [[Emory University School of Law]]. Fineman was previously the first holder of the [[Dorothea S. Clarke Professor of Feminist Jurisprudence|Dorothea S. Clarke Professorship of Feminist Jurisprudence]] at [[Cornell Law School]] and held the Maurice T. Moore Professorship at [[Columbia Law School]].

Fineman is one of the most influential figures in [[feminist legal theory]] and [[critical legal theory]] and directs the [[Feminism and Legal Theory Project]], which she founded in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.emory.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/martha-albertson-fineman.html&lt;/ref&gt; Much of her early scholarship focuses on the legal regulation of family and intimacy, and she has been called "the preeminent feminist family theorist of our time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Polikoff |first1= Nancy D.  |year= 2000 |title= Why Lesbians and Gay Men Should Read Martha Fineman |journal= The Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law |volume= 9 |issue=1 |pages= 167–176 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1094&amp;context=jgspl |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since broadened her scope to focus on the legal implications of universal dependency, vulnerability and [[justice]]. Her recent work formulates a theory of vulnerability, in order to argue for a more responsive state and a more egalitarian society. She is a prominent [[Modern liberalism in the United States|progressive liberal]] thinker; she has been an affiliated scholar of [[John Podesta]]'s [[Center for American Progress]] and has been described as a "close friend of the [[Obama administration]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thefederalist.com/2015/07/09/rand-paul-dont-swallow-the-bait/ Rand Paul, Don’t Swallow The Bait], July 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Fineman has a B.A. from [[Temple University]] (1971) and a J.D. from the [[University of Chicago Law School|University of Chicago]] (1975).  After graduating from law school, she clerked for the Hon. [[Luther Merritt Swygert]] of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and was on faculty at the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]] from 1976 to 1990.  Subsequently, Fineman moved to [[Columbia Law School]],  where she was appointed as the Maurice T. Moore Professor of Law in 1990. She went on to become the first [[Dorothea S. Clarke Professor of Feminist Jurisprudence]] at [[Cornell Law School]] in 1999; the professorship being the first endowed chair in feminist jurisprudence at a law school in the United States. Since 2004, she has been a [[Robert W. Woodruff Professor]] of Law at [[Emory University School of Law]], which is the institution's highest honor bestowed on a faculty member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.emory.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/martha-albertson-fineman.html Emory Law School: Martha Albertson Fineman&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The honor is "reserved for world-class scholars who are not only proven leaders of their own fields of specialty, but also ambitious bridge-builders across specialty disciplines."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas C.

Perry]] to be appointed to such a chair.

Fineman directs the [[Feminism and Legal Theory Project]], which she founded in 1984 and which has been housed by the University of Wisconsin Law School, Columbia Law School, Cornell Law School, and Emory Law.

Fineman is an affiliated scholar of the [[Center for American Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanprogress.org/aboutus/scholars/FinemanMartha.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108143537/http://www.americanprogress.org/aboutus/scholars/FinemanMartha.html/ |archivedate=2007-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September of 2018, she was ranked the '''#1 Most-Cited Family Law Faculty in the U.S. for the period 2013-2017''' on ''[[Brian Leiter]]'' Law School Reports, based on Sisk Annual Report data.&lt;ref&gt;https://leiterlawschool.typepad.com/leiter/2018/08/top-50-law-schools-based-on-scholarly-impact-2018.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Work on dependency and vulnerability==

In her 2004 book ''The Autonomy Myth: A Theory of Dependency'', Fineman "argues that popular ideology in the United States has become fixated on the myth that citizens are and should be autonomous. Yet the fact that dependency is unavoidable in any society and must be dealt with to sustain the polity, Fineman contends, gives the state the responsibility to support caretaking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Eichner |first1= Maxine |year= 2005 |title= Dependency and the Liberal Polity: On Martha Fineman's The Autonomy Myth |journal= [[California Law Review]] |volume= 93 |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= |ssrn= 668561 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her 2008 article "The Vulnerable Subject" in the ''[[Yale Journal of Law and Feminism]]'' develops a theory of vulnerability in order to argue for a more responsive state and a more egalitarian society. The article forms the basis for her 2011 book, also titled ''The Vulnerable Subject''.

Fineman argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Vulnerability is and should be understood to be universal and constant, inherent in the human condition. The vulnerability approach is an alternative to traditional equal protection analysis; it represents a post-identity inquiry in that it is not focused only on discrimination against defined groups, but concerned with privilege and favor conferred on limited segments of the population by the state and broader society through their institutions. As such, vulnerability analysis concentrates on the institutions and structures our society has and will establish to manage our common vulnerabilities. This approach has the potential to move us beyond the stifling confines of current discrimination-based models toward a more substantive vision of equality.&lt;ref&gt;M. Fineman, "The Vulnerable Subject: Anchoring Equality in the Human Condition", [[Yale Journal of Law and Feminism]], Vol. 20, No. 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Selberg and Wegerstad,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fundamental to Fineman's scholarly work is a feminist critique of notions of equality, the liberal subject and prevailing anti-discrimination politics. According to Fineman, the current anti-discrimination doctrine assumes that discrimination is the discoverable and correctable exception to an otherwise just and fair system, characterized by values such as individual liberty and autonomy. Developing her work on dependency, Fineman raises the question: if our bodily fragility, material needs, and the possibility of messy dependency they signify cannot be ignored in life, how can they be absent in our theories about equality, society, politics and law?' Moving beyond gender and other identity categories, Fineman uses the concept of vulnerability to 'define the very meaning of what it means to be human.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Selberg|first1=Niklas|last2=Wegerstad|first2=Linnéa|year= 2011 |title= Interview with Professor Martha Albertson Fineman |journal= [[Retfærd|Retfærd.

A '''military night''' or '''Prussian night''' refers to the custom of allowing complaints and the like only the day later in order to ensure a rethinking of the occasion overnight.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} This custom originated from the Prussian and British Armies and, as set out in the [[Military Complaints Regulations of the German Armed Forces]] or the [[General regulation of the Austrian Armed Forces]], exists even in some of today's armies.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The '''Montreal Convention''' (formally, the '''Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air''') is a [[multilateral treaty]] adopted by a diplomatic meeting of [[ICAO]] member states in 1999. It amended important provisions of the [[Warsaw Convention]]'s regime concerning compensation for the victims of air disasters. The Convention attempts to re-establish uniformity and predictability of rules relating to the international carriage of [[passenger]]s, [[baggage]] and cargo. Whilst maintaining the core provisions which have served the international [[air transport]] community for several decades (i.e., the Warsaw regime), the new treaty achieves modernization in a number of key areas. It protects passengers by introducing a two-tier liability system that eliminates the previous requirement of proving willful neglect by the air carrier to obtain more than US$75,000 in damages, which should eliminate or reduce protracted litigation.&lt;ref name = "73 Year Odyssey"&gt;[http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=913117 A 73-Year Odyssey: The Time Has Come For a New International Air Liability System].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Damages ==

Under the Montreal Convention, air carriers are [[strictly liable]] for proven damages up to 100,000.00 [[special drawing rights]] (SDR), a mix of currency values established by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) equal to roughly $150,000 USD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iata.org/policy/consumer-pax-rights/Documents/mc99-full-text.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Where damages of more than 100,000.00 SDR are sought, the airline may avoid liability by proving that the accident which caused the injury or death was not due to their negligence or was attributable solely to the negligence of a third party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iata.org/policy/Documents/MC99_en.pdf IATA: The Montreal Convention 1999 (Article 22)]&lt;/ref&gt; This defense is not available where damages of less than 100,000.00 SDR are sought. The Convention also amended the jurisdictional provisions of Warsaw and now allows the victim or their families to sue foreign carriers where they maintain their principal residence, and requires all air carriers to carry [[legal liability|liability]] insurance.

The Montreal Convention was brought about mainly to amend liabilities to be paid to families for death or injury whilst on board an aircraft.

== No compensation purely for psychiatric injury ==

The Convention refuses to pay any compensation for psychiatric injury or damage unless inextricably linked to the physical injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jus.uio.no/lm/air.carriage.unification.convention.montreal.1999/17.html|title=17 -     Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air - Montreal, 28 May 1999|work=uio.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Dubious |Inaccurate content with respect to "psychiatric injury" ("mental distress")|date=May 2016}} Purely psychiatric injury is not eligible for compensation which has been criticised by people injured in plane accidents,&lt;ref&gt;[[2009 Pel-Air Westwind ditching]]&lt;/ref&gt; legal experts&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-23/survivor-of-norfolk-plane-crash-still-fighting-for-compensation/6339242|title=Pel-Air crash survivor Karen Casey entitled to compensation for psychological trauma, Nick Xenophon says|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/she-was-like-a-ghost-australian-plane-crash-survivors-tragic-story/story-fn6yjmoc-1227274733103|title=Karen Casey, Pel-Air crash survivor tells of PTSD on 4 Corners|work=NewsComAu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
Australia changed its law so as to fit with the Montreal Convention including in some of the following ways

* the removal of references to ‘personal injury’ and replaced with ‘bodily injury’ under the CACL Act&lt;ref name="www5.austlii.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cala1959327/|title=CIVIL AVIATION (CARRIERS' LIABILITY) ACT 1959|work=austlii.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure consistency with the 1999 Montreal Convention concerning international flights;
* the preclusion of potential claimants from claiming compensation for mental injuries where that person has not suffered additional personal or property damage&lt;ref name="www5.austlii.edu.au"/&gt;

Independent Australian senator Nick Xenophon will introduce a private member's bill into the Australian Parliament in May 2015 which will seek to protect the rights of plane crash survivors to be compensated for psychological trauma.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;

Leading Australian current affairs TV show 4 Corners on the government owned broadcaster ABC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/|title=ABC - Australian Broadcasting Corporation|work=abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; broadcast a program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2015/03/23/4199980.htm|title=Ditched|work=abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on the unfairness and injustice of excluding psychiatric injury on March 23, 2015 featuring Karen Casey, a nurse injured when the medical evacuation flight she was nursing on crashed in the waters off Norfolk Island.

== Lost baggage ==

The Montreal Convention changes and generally increases the maximum liability of airlines for lost baggage to a fixed amount 1,131 SDR per passenger (the amount in the Warsaw Convention is based on weight of the baggage). It requires airlines to fully compensate travelers the cost of replacement items purchased until the baggage is delivered, to a maximum of 1,131 SDR. At 21 days any delayed baggage is considered lost, until the airline finds and delivers it.

== Disabled passengers and mobility equipment ==

The limitation of compensation for damage to baggage to 1,131 SDRs means that the value of damaged mobility equipment may often significantly exceed available compensation under the Montreal Convention, while the effect of the loss, even temporarily, of mobility equipment places disabled passengers at a substantially increased disadvantage in comparison to other passengers suffering damaged baggage. While for non-disabled people the major issue is the loss of hold baggage, for disabled people the problem tends to be physical damage to wheelchairs and other durable medical equipment due to inappropriate stowage in the hold. Even a basic individually-fitted wheelchair may cost twice the available compensation, with a three month lead time for replacement. There have been further problems with airlines being reluctant to recognise that cheap mass-market wheelchairs may be unsuitable as even a temporary replacement due to the common need for customised seating solutions among long-term wheelchair users.

The EU in "Communication on the scope of the liability of air carriers and airports in the event of destroyed, damaged or lost mobility equipment of [[passengers with reduced mobility]] when traveling by air"&lt;ref name = liability&gt;[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52008DC0510&amp;from=EN Scope of Liability].&lt;/ref&gt; notes this disadvantage in relation to EC 1107/2006 "[[Disabled rights|rights]] of [[Disability|disabled persons]] and persons with reduced mobility when traveling by air".&lt;ref name = PRM&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006R1107:EN:NOT (EC)1107/2006].&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU report notes that the United States under the Air Carrier Access Act and Canada under Part VII of the Air Transport Regulations have taken action to force airlines to fully cover the costs of damage to mobility equipment as a condition of allowing an airline to operate in their airspace, and notes that the EU may have to take similar steps if the additional duties imposed on airlines by EC 1107/2006 do not resolve the issue.

== Ratifications ==
As September 2018, there are 133 parties to the Convention. Included in this total is 132 of the 191 ICAO Member States plus the [[European Union]]. The states that have ratified represent 131 [[UN member states]] plus the [[Cook Islands]]. Other states that have ratified include [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], all member states of the [[European Union]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], Nepal [[Norway]], [[Pakistan]], [[Russia]] [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]], [[Ukraine]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name = ratifications&gt;[http://www.icao.int/secretariat/legal/List%20of%20Parties/Mtl99_EN.pdf Signatures and ratifications].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Assembly''' politically is either a [[legislature]], or the [[lower house]]{{refn|[[Nepal]] and [[Tajikistan]] being the exception, with their National Assembly as the higher houses of bicameral Parliament|group=n|name=first}} of a [[bicameral]] legislature in some countries. In the English language it generally means "an assembly composed of the representatives of the nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged with Seven Language Dictionary | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | year=1986 | volume=Volume II H to R | author=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population base represented by this name is manifestly the nation as a whole, as opposed to a geographically select population, such as that represented by a provincial assembly. Its powers vary according to the type of government. It may possess all the powers, generally governing by committee, or it may function within the legislative branch of the government.

The name also must be distinguished from the concept. Conceptually such an institution may appear under variety of names, especially if "national assembly" is being used to translate foreign names of the same concept into English. Also, the degree to which the National Assembly speaks for the nation is a variable. To achieve a quorum, the ancient Athenian Assembly employed Scythian police to arrest citizens at random from the street. On the other hand, the early Parliaments of Europe were mainly of an aristocratic composition. The word had its origins and inspirations from the National Assembly that was responsible for drafting a constitution during the [[French Revolution]].

The exact words, "national assembly," have been used prolifically in the international community of nations since the 18th and 19th centuries, considered the [[Age of Revolution]] in western Europe. Nations that formed republics in this age subsequently formed empires. Extensive cross-cultural influences brought much of their language and institutions to the provinces. When these empires collapsed finally, the emancipated countries formed states and other institutions on the model of the former imperial nations. Some examples of international influences are as follows:

In [[Germany]], a [[Nationalversammlung (disambiguation)|Nationalversammlung]] was elected following the revolutions of [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848–1849]] and [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|1918–1919]], to be replaced by a permanent [[parliament]] ([[Reichstag (German Empire)#The Reichstag as the German Parliament|Reichstag]]) later. The legislature of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime in [[Portugal]] was known as the National Assembly, while the [[Corporative Chamber]] was a purely advisory chamber. The national assembly was also defined in the Republic of China constitution. This is different from the [[Legislative Yuan]] by the ROC constitution. In 2005, Taiwan revised the constitution and national assembly was abolished. Examples have multiplied greatly under the policy of self-determination adopted by the western nations. Many more are to be found in the articles listed below.

== Origin of the Expression ==
Perhaps the best known National Assembly was that established during the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, known as the ''[[National Assembly (French Revolution)|Assemblée nationale]]''. Consequently, the name is particularly common in [[Francophone]] countries. It was also the name of the legislature during [[France]]'s [[French First Republic|First Republic]] and the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], and since 1946 has been the [[French National Assembly|lower house]] of the French [[parliament]], first under the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], and from 1958, the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]].

The expression, however, did not originate in 1789. It was already in use in the French language of the times. [[Louis XIII of France]] (1601-1643), ''par la grace de Dieu Roy de France &amp; de Navarre'', in a ''Declaration'' of April 14, 1627, concerning the sovereignty of his kingdom, prohibits ministers of foreign countries from any jurisdiction in France, citing, as precedent, his ''Lettres de Declaration'' of April 17, 1623, forbidding religious officials from treating with foreign countries. He describes his ''Declaration'' as ''ordonné qu'en Assemblées Provinciales &amp; Nationales des nosdites sujets''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Recueil des actes, titres et mémoires, concernant les affaires du clergé de France, augmenté d'un grand nombre de Pieces, &amp; mis en nouvel ordre | first=Jean | last=Le Gentil | year=1675 | volume=VI | page=731 | location=Paris | publisher=Frederic Leonard}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the "registration" that the [[Parlement]] of Paris refused to perform for [[Louis XVI of France]] in 1787-1788. When the [[Estates-General of 1789]] formed the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] of 1789, they did not believe they were instituting anything new. In the [[Assembly of Notables]] of 1787, [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette]] had used National Assembly and Estates General synonymously when he suggested that France needed a national assembly to solve its financial problems.

National Assembly is also found in some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. Its use there is not a translation of ''Assemblée nationale'', as the phrase is equally embedded in the English language. For example, at the end of the [[First English Civil War]], an Act of Parliament, 1648, "Concerning the Members of the Classical and Congregational Presbyteries, in the several counties of the Kingdom of England, and Dominion of Wales," establishes a national congregational church in England and Wales, corresponding to the presbyteries of Scotland. The language is: "The National Assembly shall be constituted of members chosen by and sent from the several Provincial Assemblies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The civil warres of Great Britain and Ireland: containing an exact history of their occasion, originall, progress, and happy end | first1=John | last1=Davies | first2=John | last2=Dancer | location=London | publisher=Printed by R.W. for Philip Chetwind | year=1661 | page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; This National Assembly appears to have no direct link to any French words, although the concept is the same.

'''''National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Boston &amp; Maine Corp.''''', 503 U.S. 407 (1992), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (better known as [[Amtrak]]), could condemn railroad property from [[Boston and Maine Corporation|Boston and Maine Railroad]] and convey it to another railroad in order to continue [[passenger rail]] service over that route.

==History==
{{main|Montrealer (train)}}
The ''[[Montrealer (train)|Montrealer]]'' was originally a service of the [[Boston and Maine Railroad]] which used B&amp;M's [[Connecticut River Line]] south of [[Vernon, Vermont]] to reach [[New York City]]. The NYC-Montréal portion of this route was continued under [[Amtrak]].

The ''Montrealer'' was suspended from early April 1987 to mid-July 1989 because of deteriorating track conditions on the Boston and Maine Railroad, which had been taken over by [[Guilford Transportation]].  During the suspension, Amtrak offered "Ambus" service (operated by Vermont Transit).

To restore passenger rail service, Amtrak seized the section of the line between [[Windsor, Vermont|Windsor]] and [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]] by [[eminent domain]]. The track was rebuilt using federal funds and sold to the [[Central Vermont Railway]]. The train was reinstated in July 1989, continuing until 1995 on a modified route which used the Central Vermont Railway (now the [[New England Central Railroad]]) from East Northfield to [[New London, Connecticut]].

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] upheld Amtrak's action.&lt;ref name="solomon" /&gt;{{rp|47}}

An '''occupational exposure limit''' is an upper limit on the acceptable [[concentration]] of a [[hazardous substance]] in workplace [[air]] for a particular material or class of materials. It is typically set by competent national authorities and enforced by legislation to protect [[occupational safety and health]]. It is an important tool in [[risk assessment]] and in the management of activities involving handling of dangerous substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=European Agency for Safety and Health at Work | title=Occupational Exposure Limits | url=http://osha.europa.eu/good_practice/topics/dangerous_substances/oel | accessdate=2008-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many dangerous substances for which there are no formal occupational exposure limits. In these cases, hazard banding or [[control banding]] strategies can be used to ensure safe handling.

== Background ==
[[File:Hierarchies of Exposure Assessment and Management.JPG|thumb|Simple representation of exposure risk assessment and management hierarchy based on available information]]

Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) have been established for airborne workplace chemicals by multiple regulatory and authoritative organizations around the world for well over 60 years now.  With the changing regulatory arena, shifting centers of manufacturing growth, and the move towards a more global view on occupational hygiene issues, it is important for the [[Occupational hygiene|Occupational Hygiene]] profession to understand the current and growing issues impacting the continued viability of OEL’s in our professional practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=IOHA | title=International OEL Issues and Activities \ | url=http://www.ioha.net/internationaloelssues.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811010958/http://www.ioha.net/internationaloelssues.html | archivedate=2015-08-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although peer-reviewed health-based OELs are preferred for establishing safe levels of exposure or for implementing adequate controls to provide worker protection, the lack of publicly available OELs have led to other sources of safe levels to protect workers.  Industrial or Occupational Hygienists are often on the front line of anticipating and recognizing the hazards of chemical exposure for workers, and must assess the risk of exposure through the use of OELs so that proper control strategies can be implemented to keep workers below the OEL values.  In the absence of OELs however, there are a variety of tools that can and should be used to assess exposure potential of workers.  The "Hierarchy of OELs" provides a continuum of occupational exposure limit values that allow assessment of the risk of exposure in order to apply adequate controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=AIHA | title=Webinar:  The New Era of Global Exposure Limit Setting Processes - Harmonization on an OEL Hierarchy Approach |url=http://www.aiha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hierarchy of Occupational Exposure Limits.JPG|thumb|Hierarchy of occupational exposure limits (OELs)]]
[[File:Analysis of air sampling data using IHSTAT.JPG|thumb|Illustration of statistical output from IHSTAT using air sampling data]]
Personal air sampling is routinely conducted on workers to determine whether exposures are acceptable or unacceptable.  These samples are collected and analyzed using validated sampling and analytical methods.  These methods are available from OSHA Technical Manual and NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nmam/ NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods]&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistical tools are available to assess exposure monitoring data against OELs.  The statistical tools are typically free but do require some previous knowledge with statistical concepts.  A popular exposure data statistical tool called "IH STAT" is available from AIHA ([[American Industrial Hygiene Association]]).  IHSTAT has 14 languages including English and is available for free.&lt;ref&gt;"Link to freeware version IHSTAT via AIHA Exposure Assessment Strategies website" https://www.aiha.org/get-involved/VolunteerGroups/Pages/Exposure-Assessment-Strategies-Committee.aspx/&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods for performing occupational exposure assessments can be found in "A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H. Bullock".&lt;ref&gt;"A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H.

==Types==
* [[Permissible exposure limit]], set by the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]
* [[Recommended exposure limit]], set by the U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]
* [[Indicative limit value]], set by the European Union
* [[Threshold Limit Value|Threshold limit value]], set by the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]]
* [[Occupational exposure banding]], a process that can be used when not enough data are available to determine quantiative exposure limits

== International limit values ==
The [[database]] ″GESTIS - International limit values for chemical agents″&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance: GESTIS – International limit values for chemical agents (Occupational exposure limits, OELs), http://www.dguv.de/ifa/gestis/gestis-internationale-grenzwerte-fuer-chemische-substanzen-limit-values-for-chemical-agents/index-2.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; contains a collection of occupational limit values for hazardous substances collected from over 30 countries: various [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Switzerland]], [[China]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United States]]. The database comprises values of more than 2,000 substances.

The present database was elaborated in co-operation with experts from various international [[occupational safety and health]] institutions. It aims to give an overview of limit values in different countries. Since the limit values vary in their handling, the level of protection, and their legal relevance, the original lists of limit values and the explanations there should be considered as primary sources. Also the [[chemical nomenclature]] is diverging, [[synonym]]s can for example be found in the [[GESTIS Substance Database]].

The database is also available as app for mobile terminals with Android or iOS operating systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3915">The '''Ombudsman for Children in Sweden''' ({{lang-sv|Barnombudsmannen}}, abbreviated ''BO'') is a [[Government agencies in Sweden|Swedish government agency]] organized under the [[Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (Sweden)|Ministry of Health and Social Affairs]] tasked with public advocacy and the dissemination of information about the rights and needs of children and young people. The Ombudsman should represent children regarding their rights and interests on the basis of the [[UN]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC). The Ombudsman has legal authority to request information and to summon representatives from the [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipalities]], [[Counties of Sweden|counties]] and other authorities to talks, but hold no regulatory powers. There's no government mandate to focus or issue an opinion on individual cases. However, the Ombudsman has a legal [[duty of notification]], meaning they are required by law to report to the local social services, whenever they become aware of an abused child.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.barnombudsmannen.se/english/|publisher=Barnombudsmannen|accessdate=25 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118152913/http://www.barnombudsmannen.se/english/|archivedate=18 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Regleringsbrev&gt;{{cite web|title=Regleringsbrev|url=http://www.esv.se/Verktyg--stod/Statsliggaren/Regleringsbrev/?RBID=14774|publisher=[[Ekonomistyrningsverket]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=legal-instruction&gt;{{cite web|title=Lag (1993:335) om Barnombudsman|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Lag-1993335-om-Barnombudsma_sfs-1993-335/?bet=1993:335|publisher=The Swedish Government|accessdate=25 July 2014|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Ombudsman holds regular dialogues with children, especially those in vulnerable situations, to obtain knowledge of their conditions and their opinions. The agency report back to the government once a year, and the report consists of a magazine, usually with a specific theme; with additional information presented on the Ombudsman's website.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; 

==History==
In 1990 the [[Riksdag]] ratified the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]]. Sweden was thereby committed under international law to implement the Convention, and around the same time the Government appointed a [[Commission of inquiry]] to examine the issue of appointing an Ombudsman for Children. In 1993, the Riksdag finally approved the appointment of an Ombudsman, and The Ombudsman for Children's Act ([http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Lag-1993335-om-Barnombudsma_sfs-1993-335/?bet=1993:335 1993:335]) came into effect on July 1.&lt;ref name="Background" /&gt; 

==List of Ombudsmen for Children==
There have been three Ombudsman for Children in Sweden, since the agency was formed:&lt;ref name=Background&gt;{{cite web|title=Background|url=http://www.barnombudsmannen.se/english/about-us/background/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118194322/http://www.barnombudsmannen.se/english/about-us/background/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 January 2015|publisher=Barnombudsmannen|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3653">'''Overlawyered''' is a law [[blog]] on the subject of [[tort reform]] run by author [[Walter Olson]]. Founded in 1999, it is "widely considered to be the oldest legal blog and is also one of the most popular", according to [[Law.com]].&lt;ref name=lawcom&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/legaltechnology/pubArticleLT.jsp?id=1202426527551|publisher=Law.com|title=How to Build a Better Law Blog|author=C.C.

On April 26, 2013, Olson announced the blog had affiliated itself with the [[Cato Institute]], where he is a senior fellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://overlawyered.com/2013/04/overlawyered-now-cato-institute-blog|title=Overlawyered: now a Cato Institute blog|first=Walter|last=Olson|date=2013-04-16|accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispute with aviation tort lawyer==
In 2010, aviation tort lawyer [[Arthur Alan Wolk]] sued Overlawyered, Olson, and contributors [[Ted Frank]] and David Nieporent for libel over a post written by Frank.&lt;ref name=Sullum&gt;[[Jacob Sullum]], ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', [http://reason.com/blog/2010/08/06/lawyer-trying-to-protect-his-r "Lawyer Trying to Protect His Reputation As an Effective Advocate Misses Deadline for His Libel Suit"], August 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ww&gt;http://www.whiteandwilliams.com/CM/Publications/COURTDISMISSESDEFAMATIONCLAIMAGAINSTLEGALBLOG.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Mary A.

SAFLII was formally created in 2002 as a joint project between the [[Australasian Legal Information Institute]] (AustLII) and the [[University of Witwatersrand]] (Wits) in Johannesburg, South Africa. In 2006 the [[South African Constitutional Court Trust]] assumed ownership of the project. The website at the time of this transition carried approximately 700 judgments from South Africa and Namibia.

SAFLII is currently in operation from within the Democratic Governance and Rights Unit (DGRU) at the [[University of Cape Town]] and has been there from December 2013.

SAFLII became a member of the [[Free Access to Law Movement]] at the Law Via the Internet conference in 2003.

Currently, SAFLII serves over 120,000 unique visitors per month and provides access to about 30,000 judgements from South Africa alone. It also offers over 17,000 judgements from other countries in the region, either directly or through linking to the different Legal Information Institutes already present throughout Southern and Eastern Africa. SAFLII also offers access to legislation and open-access journals such as ''De Jure'', the ''Potchefstroom Electronic Law Journal'', ''SADC Law Journal'' and ''Law, Democracy &amp; Development''.

SAFLII also offers free access to current and historical versions of [[South African national legislation]].

[[File:Zgrada DORH Zagreb.jpg|thumb|right|DORH headquarters in Zagreb]]
'''State's Attorney Office of the Republic of Croatia''' ({{lang-hr|Državno odvjetništvo Republike Hrvatske}} or '''DORH''') is an autonomous and independent judicial body empowered and duty-bound to instigate prosecution of perpetrators of criminal and other penal offences, to initiate legal measures to protect the property of the Republic of Croatia and to apply legal remedies to protect the [[Constitution of Croatia|Croatian Constitution]] and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabor.hr/ustav-rh-ustrojstvo-drzavne-vlasti |title=Hrvatski sabor |publisher=Sabor.hr |date= |accessdate=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DORH is a unique judicial body that has authority over the whole Croatian territory. Its head is an Attorney General who has deputies. DORH headquarters are in [[Zagreb]], but it is also decentralized and is thus divided into 22 municipal and 15 county offices. Nevertheless, it is a strictly hierarchically structured body, so municipal offices are subordinated to the county offices, while country offices are subordinated to the central office in Zagreb. In addition, [[USKOK|Croatian State Prosecutor's Office for the Suppression of Organized Crime and Corruption]] (USKOK) is a special body of DORH specialized in investigations related to corruption and organized crime.

==Organization and jurisdiction==
Organization and jurisdiction of the State's Attorney Office are regulated with ''The Act on the State's Attorney Office''.

The  State’s Attorney Office competent in criminal proceedings is obligated to prosecute and represent the charges against perpetrators of criminal acts which are prosecuted ''ex officio'' or upon the proposal and undertake other actions defined by the law. The competent  State’s Attorney Office acts in misdemeanor proceedings in line with the powers granted to it under the law. A competent State’s Attorney Office represents the Republic of
Croatia in the protection of assets and other rights in the civil and administrative matters, unless otherwise determined by law or the decision of a competent state body.

The Municipal Offices represent Croatia in the proceedings before a municipal court, a misdemeanor court and administrative bodies, County Offices represent Croatia in the proceedings before a county, administrative and commercial court, while the Central Office represents Croatia, and oversees and protects the rule of law and proceeds with all actions before the [[Supreme Court of Croatia|Supreme Court]], [[Constitutional Court of Croatia|Constitutional Court]], High Administrative Court, High Commercial Court, High Misdemeanor Court, and international and foreign justice and other bodies.

==Structure of DORH==
DORH consist of:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dorh.hr/UstrojDrzavnogOdvjetnistva |title=Državno odvjetništvo Republike Hrvatske |publisher=Dorh.hr |date= |accessdate=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* (Central) State's Attorney Office of the Republic of Croatia (DORH)
* 15 county State's Attorney Offices (in [[Bjelovar]], [[Dubrovnik]], [[Karlovac]], [[Osijek]], [[Pula]], [[Rijeka]], [[Sisak]], [[Slavonski Brod]], [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Šibenik]], [[Varaždin]], [[Velika Gorica]], [[Vukovar]], [[Zadar]], [[Zagreb]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dorh.hr/Default.aspx?sec=628 |title=Državno odvjetništvo Republike Hrvatske |publisher=Dorh.hr |date= |accessdate=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ŽDO)
* 22 municipal State's Attorney Offices (ODO)
* [[USKOK|Croatian State Prosecutor's Office for the Suppression of Organized Crime and Corruption]] (USKOK)

===Internal structure of the central office===
The Central office has four departments:
* 1. Criminal - responsible for taking legal actions against the perpetrators of crimes and other criminal activities
* 2. Civil and Administrative - responsible for taking legal actions to protect the assets of Croatia, providing legal remedies to protect the Constitution and the laws, representing Croatia in proceedings before courts and administrative bodies, and protecting Croatian property and legal interests
* 3. for Internal Audit 
* 4. for International Legal Assistance and Cooperation

===Attorney General and deputies===
Attorney General is managing and representing State's Attorney Office. According to ''The Act on the State's Attorney Office'', any Croatian citizen meeting the general and special requirements for the appointment of a deputy in the State’s Attorney Office may be appointed as Attorney General. Attorney General is appointed for a four-year term by the [[Croatian Parliament]] upon the motion of the [[Croatian Government]] and following a prior opinion of the Parliament's Justice Committee. He may be reappointed to the same office numerous times, but if that doesn't happen he has a right to either leave the Office or to continue to work as a deputy attorney. County and Municipal State’s Attorneys are appointed for a four-year term by the National State's Attorney Council consisting of seven deputy state's attorneys (elected among and by them from the Office of Attorney General, from county and municipal offices), two university professors of law (chosen by the Croatian universities) and two MPs (one of whom must be from the opposition parties); with a prior opinion issued by the [[Ministry of Justice (Croatia)|Minister of Justice]] and the Collegiate Body of the State’s Attorney Office. County State’s Attorneys are appointed from among the state’s attorneys and deputies in the county state’s attorney offices or a higher state’s attorney office with five years of working experience in the Office.
Deputy state's attorneys (in the Office of the Attorney General, in the county and municipal state's attorney offices) are appointed by the National State's Attorney Council. The National State's Attorney Council decides also on disciplinary proceedings concerning state's attorney and deputy state's attorneys (except the Attorney General).

A state’s attorney terminates his office when deceased, when he has attained the age of 70 years, and upon the dismissal. State Attorney can be released from duty if he has exercised his duties in an illegal, untimely and insufficiently expert manner; the state’s attorney office he represents fails to achieve satisfactory results; he fails to perform the duties in a state’s attorney office or justice
administration in conformity with the regulations or fails to perform them in due time; has failed to file a request for a disciplinary proceeding in the matters determined by law; he commits an action corresponding to the action referred to under Article
84 of The Act on the State's Attorney Office; the grounds for the dismissal referred to under Article 69, Paragraph 1, items 1 to 4 of The Act on the State's Attorney Office exist. The motion for the dismissal of the State’s Attorney General may be filed by the Government. The final verdict is in the hands of the Parliament, that has to obtain an opinion from the Justice Committee.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7984">[[Image:Ti83plus.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A TI-83+ graphing calculator displaying a [[sine wave]]]]
The '''Texas Instruments signing key controversy''' refers to the controversy which resulted from [[Texas Instruments]]' (TI) response to a project to [[RSA problem|factorize]] the 512-[[bit]] [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] [[key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]] needed to write custom [[firmware]] to TI devices.

==Project==
In July 2009, Benjamin Moody, a United-TI [[Internet forum|forum]] user, published the [[integer factorization|factors]] of a 512-bit [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] key used to sign the [[TI-83 series|TI-83+ series]] graphing calculator. The discovery of the private key would allow end users to [[flash memory|flash]] their own [[operating system]]s onto the device without having to use any special software. Moody used two free implementations of the [[general number field sieve]], msieve and ggnfs; the computation took 73 days on a 1.9&amp;nbsp;GHz dual-core processor. This demonstrates the progress of hardware development: the factorization of the similar 512-bit [[RSA-155]] in 1999 using the same algorithm required a large dedicated research group, 8000 MIPS-years of computing time, and a [[Cray C90|Cray C916]] supercomputer.&lt;ref&gt;Herman te Riele (1999-08-26), [http://listserv.nodak.edu/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind9908&amp;L=nmbrthry&amp;P=1905 New factorization record] (announcement of factorization of RSA-155). Retrieved on 2008-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, members of the wider TI graphing calculators community (at yAronet) set up a [[BOINC]]-based [[distributed computing]] project, RSA Lattice Siever (RSALS for short), that quickly factored the other keys.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.ticalc.org/archives/news/articles/14/145/145273.html
|title=All TI Signing Keys Factored&amp;nbsp;— ticalc.org
|publisher=www.ticalc.org
|accessdate=2009-09-21
|last=
|first=
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
RSA Lattice Siever remained active for nearly three years after outliving its initial purpose, by factoring other integers for the mathematical community.
After factoring over 400 integers,&lt;ref&gt;http://boinc.unsads.com/rsals/crunching.php&lt;/ref&gt; RSALS moved to RSALS-inspired NFS@home&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=306539&amp;postcount=434&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of August 2012.

==Legal response==
Texas Instruments began by sending out two initial [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] take-down requests to the hackers, referring to sites or forum posts that they controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandonw.net/ |title=brandonw.net |publisher=brandonw.net |date= |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Signing Keys and the DMCA&amp;nbsp;— ticalc.org
|publisher=www.ticalc.org
|accessdate=2009-09-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hackers responded by removing the keys, without consulting an attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/09/23/texas_instruments_calculator_hacking/ |title=Texas Instruments aims lawyers at calculator hackers |publisher=The Register |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; TI then sent further DMCA notices to a variety&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/09/ti-leave-those-kids-alone |title=UPDATE: Hey, TI, Leave Those Kids Alone &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[website]]s displaying the keys, including United-TI, [[reddit]], and [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate  = 2014-02-03

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas Instruments' efforts then became subject to the [[Streisand effect]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Schneier on Security: Texas Instruments Signing Keys Broken
|publisher=www.schneier.com
|accessdate=2009-10-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the keys were mirrored on a number of sites, including [[WikiLeaks]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Suppressed_Texas_Instruments_cryptographic_signing_keys,_28_Aug_2009 Suppressed Texas Instruments cryptographic signing keys, 28 Aug 2009] at [[WikiLeaks]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/66ozvNWAc Archived] on 10 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[WordPress]]. In September 2009, Dan Goodin from ''[[The Register]]'' alerted the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) to TI's actions, and the EFF agreed to take on the case ''[[pro bono]]'', representing three people who had received DMCA notices.

On October 13, 2009, the EFF sent a letter to TI warning them that the posting of the keys did not violate the DMCA, and that it may be liable for misrepresentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=EFF Warns Texas Instruments to Stop Harassing Calculator Hobbyists
|publisher=EFF official press release
|accessdate=2009-10-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the letter by the EFF, TI continued to send DMCA notices to websites that posted the keys, but stopped doing so after late 2009. The EFF filed a [[DMCA 512|DMCA Section 512 counter-notice]] on behalf of three of the bloggers who received DMCA notices. When the EFF did not receive a response by the deadline, the bloggers re-posted the content that had been taken down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Cryptographic keys==
The public [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] parameters of the original [[TI-83+]] / TI-83+ Silver Edition OS signing key factored by Benjamin Moody are the following 512-bit modulus ''n'' and public (or encryption) exponent ''e'' (specified in [[hexadecimal]]):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wlstorage.net/file/ti-os-keys-dmca-2009.txt

By factoring ''n'', Moody obtained the factors ''p'' (252 bits) and ''q'' (260 bits), which can be used in turn to quickly compute the 512-bit private (or decryption) exponent {{nowrap|1=''d'' = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; mod (''p''−1)(''q''−1)}}:

 p = B709D3A0CD2FEC08EAFCCF540D8A100BB38E5E091D646ADB7B14D021096FFCD
 q = B7207BD184E0B5A0B89832AA68849B29EDFB03FBA2E8917B176504F08A96246CB
 d = 4D0534BA8BB2BFA0740BFB6562E843C7EC7A58AE351CE11D43438CA239DD9927
     6CD125FEBAEE5D2696579FA3A3958FF4FC54C685EAA91723BC8888F292947BA1

The value ''d'' can then be used to sign arbitrary OS software.

The keys factored by RSA Lattice Siever (the [[TI-92+]], [[TI-73]], [[TI-89]], [[Voyage 200]], [[TI-89]] Titanium, [[TI-84+]] / TI-84 Silver Edition OS signing and date-stamp signing keys) are similar but with different values of ''n'', ''p'', ''q'', and ''d''. A single date-stamp signing key is shared by all models.

'''''Paquete Habana; The Lola''''', 175 U.S. 677 (1900), was a landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that reversed an earlier court decision allowing the capture of fishing vessels under [[Prize (law)|Prize]]. Its importance rests on the fact that it integrated [[customary international law]] with American law, perhaps the quintessential position of those who hold a [[monist]] perspective of international law.

==Background of the case==
In April 1898 two fishing vessels, the ''Paquete Habana'' and the ''Lola'', separately left [[Cuba]]n ports in Havana in order to fish. The two vessels were eventually captured by US merchant vessels as part of [[William T. Sampson|Admiral William T. Sampson]]'s blockade of Cuba, who was ordered to execute the blockade 'in pursuance of the laws of the United States, and the ''law of nations'' applicable to such cases.' The vessels were placed within Cuba's territorial waters at the onset of the [[Spanish–American War]] and then taken to Key West, where both vessels were eventually auctioned by the district court. Both vessels were valued under the price of $2,000(US) and were thus not originally thought to be exempt from seizure.

Admiral Sampson justified the seizures by stating that most fishing vessels, flying under the Spanish banner were manned by excellent seamen, "liable for further service" as naval reserves, an asset that could eventually be used against US interests in the Spanish–American War.

The owners of the vessels however made an appeal to the circuit courts, citing a long-held tradition by nations of exempting fishing vessels from prize capture in times of war. This "tradition", a primary example of customary international law, dates back from an order by [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] in 1403, and has more or less been observed by a large majority of States ever since.

At the time of capture both vessels had no evidence of aiding the enemy, and were unaware of the US naval blockade. No arms were found on board, and no attempts were made to either run the blockade or resist capture.

==The court's decision and merits==
The United States Supreme Court cited lengthy legal precedents established to support the existence of a customary international law that exempted fishing vessels from prize capture, dating all the way back to ancient times and occurring repeatedly between Great Britain and France. In 1403, King Henry IV of England issued his officers leave fisherman alone during times of war. He then signed a treaty with France reaffirming this act between both parties. Again in 1521 between Emperor Charles V and Francis I of France a treaty was assigned. This treaty was invoked due to a desperate rise in the markets for herring. With the war between the two countries raging on, fisherman dared not venture out to sea. Therefore, a treaty was necessary on both accounts to prevent starvation among those who relied upon cheap herring, namely the lower classes. Situations similar to this continued to crop up throughout history prior to the Paquete case.
Using this as a basis for customary law, the court then eventually found the capture of both vessels as "unlawful and without probable cause", reversed the District Court's decision, and ordered the proceeds of the auction as well as any profits made from her cargo to be restored to the claimant, "with damages and costs".

===Fuller's dissent===
Justice [[Melville Fuller|Fuller]] delivered a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices [[John Marshall Harlan|Harlan]] and [[Joseph McKenna|McKenna]].

The '''Treaty of Kulja''' (also spelled '''Kuldja''') was an [[unequal treaty]] between [[Qing China]] and the [[Russian Empire]], signed in 1851, opening Kulja ([[Huiyuan, Xinjiang|Huiyuan]] and later [[Yining City|Ningyuan]]) and [[Tacheng|Chuguchak]] to Sino-Russian trade. Prepared by the first Russian consul to [[China]], [[Ivan Zakharov]], the treaty was preceded by a gradual Russian advance throughout the nineteenth century into [[Kazakhstan]] in direct competition with British efforts to impose self-advantageous trade terms on China.

==Historical context==
Cross-border trade became increasingly important to Russia and China in the 19th century with Russian merchants trading illegally at [[Ghulja|Kulja]] in [[Xinjiang]]’s [[Ili River|Yili River Valley]]. In 1803, [[Tsar Alexander I]] attempted to negotiate the opening of the entire Sino-Russian border to trade. This effort failed, however, when the Tsar’s representative refused to [[kow-tow]] to a tablet representing the Emperor.

Preceded by a gradual Russian advance throughout the 18th century into [[Kazakhstan]], in direct competition with British efforts to impose self-advantageous trade terms on China, the  treaty was signed on 25{{nbsp}}July 1851 by the [[General of Ili]] and his assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ram|last1=Rahul|title=Central Asia: An Outline History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXgkHBRRKd4C|year= 1997|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-81-7022-679-6|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under its terms Kulja ([[Huiyuan, Xinjiang|Huiyuan]] and later Ningyuan) and Chuguchak (modern [[Tacheng]]) were opened to Russian trade.

The treaty also allowed Russian merchants to trade and Russian consuls to reside in the Xinjiang towns of Yili ([[Huiyuan, Xinjiang|Huiyuan]] before 1863 and Ningyuan after 1882) and Tarbagatai (Chuguchak, [[Tacheng]]) for eight and one half months each year. Russian trade with Xinjiang flourished and [[Alma Ata]] was founded in 1854 to become an important link in this trade. 
     
While the treaty primarily legalized ongoing practice, it also recognized the growing Russian presence in [[Central Asia]]. China’s defenses on this border had been greatly neglected since the start of the 19th century.

The official text of the treaty was written in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[French language|French]] and [[Manchu language|Manchu]]; the original treaty did not have an official [[Chinese language|Chinese]] version.

A Russian and Chinese border commission assembled at [[T'a-ch'eng]] (also known as Tarbagatai or Chuguchak) in China on 13 May 1861 in order to map the western border in accordance with Article III of the [[Convention of Peking|Treaty of Peking]] of 1860. The actual surveying did not begin until 11 July 1862. Both countries sought to influence the survey by the threat of military force and by alliances with local tribes, but the Russian delegation was under orders to insist on a border determined by topography and not by the boundaries between local ethnic groups. According to Babkov, "The deployment of our forces on the border clearly demonstrated to the Chinese that we had the means to uphold our demands with an armed hand whenever we wished. [This deployment] on our side of the Chinese pickets, under no circumstances can be considered a violation of international law or of friendly relations: all forces are deployed on the lands of the Kirghiz, who are Russian subjects, and ... are under strict orders never to cross the permanent Chinese picket line."{{sfn|Paine|1996|p=90}}

Negotiations were burdened by disagreements in interpreting Article II of the Treaty of Peking. The Chinese argued that it could not be taken as the basis for negotiations since the Chinese delegate who negotiated it was ignorant of central Asian conditions. The article also failed to distinguish between the different Chinese picket lines. The Chinese delegation argued that the outermost picket line was intended, while the Russians insisted that only the innermost picket line of permanent control could count. Both claimed the inhabitants between the two picket lines as their own subjects. The Russians rejected all Chinese maps as unscientific. The first round of negotiations ended in failure in September 1862.{{sfn|Paine|1996|p=91}}

In the summer of 1863 the Russians sent out an independent survey team, which resulted in skirmishes between Russian and Chinese troops. The objective of Russian policy in settling its border with China in 1858–64 was to establish control over a region and negotiate recognition of its sovereignty after the fact. The intensification of the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–77)|Dungan Revolt]] that broke out in the spring of 1862 drew China's attention away from the border and toward internal security in Xinjiang. When the Chinese finally signed a protocol delimiting the border in Russia's favour, the delegates warned the Russians that the rebels were approaching Tarbagatai.{{sfn|Paine|1996|p=91}} The rebel leader, [[Yaqub Beg]], initially refused to recognise the new border and recruited Kirghiz from the Russian side.{{sfn|Paine|1996|p=122}} As a result of the rebellion, the border markers, which were to be set up in 1865, were not put in place until 1869.{{sfn|Paine|1996|p=91}} Further border protocols were signed at [[Khovd (city)|Khovd]] in 1869 and at Tarbagatai in 1870.{{sfn|Paine|1996|p=102 n. 78}}

[[File:Processing facility at the Follo Line tunnel project .jpg|thumb|Imge taken from the facility where concrete elements are produced in huge amounts. At site the tunnel debries are recycled into concrete aggregates for the tunnel elements]]

'''Tunnel rock recycling''' is a method to process rock debris from tunneling into other usable needs. The most common is for  [[Concrete]] aggregates or as [[Subbase (pavement)]] for roadbuilding. Crushers and screeners normally used in quarries are placed at the tunnel site for the one purpose which is to crush and screen the rock debries. Swiss engineers/entreprenours have the most comprehensive experience in this field. The largest tunnel rock recycling facility ever to be created was for the construction of the [[Gotthard Base Tunnel]] which took 17 years, finishing in 2016.

In an average tunnel project the excavated rock is mostley regarded as waste. In most cases it's given away or used in a landfill.  Starting up a facility for recycling the rock debries are hugely expensive. Though for a large project  as for example a double barrel tunnel longer than 20&amp;nbsp;km it's feasible. The Gotthard base tunnel was a 57&amp;nbsp;km long tunnel.

== The possibilites ==
Excavated rock utilized as concrete aggregate  is beneficial both economically and environmentally. It could be more value generating compared to using the excavated rock as landfill or filling up old [[quarries]]. Additionally, the need for transporting aggregate could be significantly reduced as the utilization of the rock could be placed close by with a processing facility and a concrete bathing plant. The investment cost of this facility would be repaid in the long run as the project would be close to self-supplied on construction aggregates.&lt;ref&gt;https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/handle/11250/2454109&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tunneling methods ==
There are two main types of tunneling, Drill &amp; Blast(D&amp;B) and Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) and both methods allow for recycling, if rock quality is approved. Both methods requires some sort of processing. TBMs creates rock particles with exsessive amounts of fines, this is a problem for both subbase and concrete aggregate, max diameter of particles is approximately 170&amp;nbsp;mm. When it comes to D&amp;B the particles can get up to 800&amp;nbsp;mm and there is a much coarser fraction, to large for subbase and concrete aggregate. The processing facility has the following choises to edit the rock mass: reduce rock size, remove fines and reduce moisture content.

== List of tunnel projects which has recylced tunnel rock ==
By 2018, there are confirmed 7 projects worldwide which have accomplished recycling of tunnel rock(TBM) on an industrial level. These projects are all placed in [[Western Europe]] and in hard rock. The concrete has either been used as [[shotcrete]] or concrete elements in [[Tunnel boring machine|TBM tunneling]].

=== Conclusion ===
By the data from the table above its on average possible to recycle 20% of the tunnel debries. The reason for the low percentage of recycled material is largely due to the large portion filler created while drilling.  In industry concrete recipes there is no need for all this filler as it would destroy the flow of the concrete in its fresh state.

== Processing tunnel debries into aggregates ==

=== Crushing ===

The main role in processing tunnel rock is crushing the rocks into smaller sizes. [[rock crushing]] is divided into two methods based on compression or impact resulting in different type of fragmentation of the material. Crushers are used in the aggregate and mineral industry and can also be divided into stationary and mobile plants. Setup of the crushers, [[feed size]] and speeds plays a major role in production of high quality [[construction aggregate]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books/about/Crushing_and_Screening.html?id=4HQ3QQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Crushing and Screening|last=Rothery|first=Ken|last2=Mellor|first2=Steve|date=2007|publisher=Institute of Quarrying|isbn=9780953800360|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a certain stage in the [[comminution]], the rock material fragments down to free minerals grains as e.g. free [[Mica]] or [[Quartz]] minerals. In Figure below are the different crusher types listed. For cubification of the rock, the [[Vertical shaft impactor]]( VSI) is a suiting crusher. The technology lets the rock crash into each other and splitting at the naturall cleavege lines. This is favorable for both subbase and concrete aggregate.

=== Screening ===
In [[Tunnel boring machine]](TBM) tunneling [[mechanical screening]] (scalping screener) is normally the first stage of the processing of tunnel rock. The  screener removes rock particles below 16 or 20&amp;nbsp;mm diameter. This is to remove the high amounts of fines which is created when TBM tunneling in hard rock. To much fines in concrete aggregates are unwated.

=== Classification and dewatering ===
If a tunnel project want to create concrete aggregates as 0/8&amp;nbsp;mm or 0/4&amp;nbsp;mm fractions it requires a more advance processing facility. Classification covers the size control of particles &lt; 1mm. Conventional screeners and crushers are not applicable below this size&lt;ref&gt;.[http://www.metso.com/miningandconstruction/MaTobox7.nsf/DocsByID/EAE6CA3B8E216295C2257E4B003FBBA6/$File/Basics-in-minerals-processing.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; A range of methods can be used for classification, though all builds on certain fundamentals. These are utilizing the natural gravitational force and the particles corresponding behavior to separate the particles into fractions or dividing a liquid from particles (dewatering/clarifying). One type of classifier is the [[Air classifier]]. Classification accuracy will be of relevance as concrete aggregates do have boundary limits according to [[Particle-size distribution]](grading) on [[Filler (materials)]] in the sand fraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metso.com/miningandconstruction/MaTobox7.nsf/DocsByID/EAE6CA3B8E216295C2257E4B003FBBA6/$File/Basics-in-minerals-processing.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Particles in this size range do also tend to cluster together. These phenomena are called agglomeration and is unfortunate in terms of concrete batching.  
Removing fines is often done with water involved, this requires a water treatment plant to clean the water. This can be done with sedimentation tanks and  [[filter press]], requiring quite a lot of space. The water which is cleansed can go back into removing more fines from the tunnel rock, and the cycle countinious.

== Creating concrete with recycled aggregates ==
Recycling rock to produce concrete aggregate is a complex procedure and will require an on-site laboratory at the tunnel project. Concrete aggregate has strict requirement which must be tested, this can in some cases  require between 5-15 different laboratory tests. Regarding mehanical strength, grading and impurities.

The requirements of the aggregate from tunnel rock is tested and measured on the same level as concrete aggregate from quarries.

Due varying water flowing through a rock massif it's normally an uncertanty what the moisture content of the rock material will be. This must be measured because it will affect the free water added during the concrete mixing, a high moisture content will require less free water to be added.

The '''Vagrancy Act 1838''' (1 &amp; 2 Vict. c. 38) was an [[Act of Parliament]] in the [[United Kingdom]], signed into law on 29 July 1838. It amended the [[Vagrancy Act 1824]] to provide that any person discharged from custody pending an appeal against a conviction under that Act who did not then reappear to prosecute the appeal could be recommitted. It also provided that the penalty established by that Act for exposing indecent prints in a street or highway would extend to those who exposed the same material in any part of a shop or house.&lt;ref&gt;''The British Almanac of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, for the year 1839''. The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, London, 1839.&lt;/ref&gt;

This latter part of the Act was to prove significant in a number of prosecutions of artists for allegedly exhibiting obscene works of art, even when those exhibitions took place in a private space such as an art gallery. One of the most notorious successful prosecutions of an artist under the act was in 1929, when thirteen paintings by [[D. H. Lawrence]] at the Warren Gallery, London, were seized by the police. A ban was placed on the paintings being shown in England, which is technically still in force, but they were shown again in London in December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= Danielle | last= Demetriou | title = Obscene art of D. H. Lawrence goes on show after 70-year ban |newspaper = The Independent | date= 4 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last artist to be successfully prosecuted under the 1838 Act was [[Stass Paraskos Obscenity Trial 1966|Stass Paraskos]] in 1966, following a police raid on an exhibition of Paraskos's work at [[Leeds College of Art]].  Again a ban was placed on showing the offending paintings and drawings in England, which is also still legally valid. However one of the paintings was shown at [[Leeds City Art Gallery]] in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= Robbin | last= Perrie | title= Banned Painting Goes on Display | newspaper= The Yorkshire Evening Post | date= 24 November 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again at Scarborough Art Gallery in 2000, and several others are now owned by the [[Tate Gallery]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editors=[[Benedict Read]] and David Thistlewood | title=Herbert Read: A British Vision of World Art | location= London | publisher= Lund Humphries | year= 1993| page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 a total of 35 people were prosecuted under section 2 of the Act and section 4 of the 1824 Act for acts of public display of obscene images in shop windows and exhibitionism. 

Although aspects of the Act had been repealed in a piecemeal fashion by subsequent legislation, the full Act was formally repealed in 1981 by the [[Indecent Displays (Control) Act 1981]] (c. 42), partly due to the lack of clarity in distinguishing between indecency and obscenity.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1979/dec/07/indecent-displays-control-bill#S5CV0975P0_19791207_HOC_35 Indecent Displays Control Act]&lt;/ref&gt; For example the advertising of contraceptives was considered obscene from 1857, but fell under the ambit of the new act of 1981.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1619">The '''Weeks–McLean Act''' was a [[law of the United States]] sponsored by [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[John W. Weeks]] (R) of [[Massachusetts]] and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[George P. McLean]] (R) of [[Connecticut]] that prohibited the [[spring (season)|spring]] [[hunting]] and [[trade|marketing]] of [[bird migration|migratory]] [[bird]]s and the [[import]]ation of wild bird [[feather]]s for women's [[fashion]], ending what was called "[[Hatmaking|millinery]] murder". It gave the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] the power to set [[hunting season]]s nationwide, making it the first [[Law of the United States|U.S. law]] ever passed to regulate the [[shooting]] of migratory birds.  It became effective on 4 March 1913 but, because of a constitutional weakness, was later replaced by the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/intrnltr/treatlaw.html A Guide to the Laws and Treaties of the United States for Protecting Migratory Birds] Accessed 15 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
