'''Alisa Marie Bellettini''' (October 1, 1954 – February 16, 2016) was an American [[television producer]]. In 1989, Bellettini created the landmark [[MTV]] television series, ''[[House of Style]]''.&lt;ref name=mtv&gt;{{cite news|first=Gaby |last=Wilson |title=House Of Style Creator Alisa Bellettini Has Died |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2742884/house-of-style-alisa-bellettini-death/ |work=[[MTV News]] |date=2016-02-19 |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Eli |last=Rosenberg |title=Alisa Bellettini, Creator of MTV’s ‘House of Style,’ Dies at 61 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/arts/television/alisa-bellettini-creator-of-mtvs-house-of-style-dies-at-61.html?_r=0 |work=[[New York Times]] |date=2016-02-24 |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series, originally hosted by [[supermodel]] [[Cindy Crawford]], brought together [[fashion]], modeling, music and [[popular culture|pop culture]]. Bellettini produced the original run of the series, which aired on MTV for 78 episodes from 1989 to 2000.&lt;ref name=mtv/&gt;&lt;ref name=thr&gt;{{cite news|first=Valerie|last=Swayne |title=MTV Revives Fashion Series 'House of Style' |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fash-track/house-of-style-mtv-revive-cindy-crawford-353381 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''House of Style'', which brought together fashion and music, debuted on [[MTV]] in 1989. In an interview for the 2012 MTV [[oral history]] book, "''I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution''," Belletini recalled her original vision for the series, "I wanted to do a show about music and fashion because I loved fashion, and at the time, MTV was driven by music."&lt;ref name=mtv/&gt;&lt;ref name=popdust&gt;{{cite news|first=Leslie |last=Price |title="Silly, Superficial, and Wonderful": An Oral History of MTV’s "House of Style" |url=http://popdust.com/2012/07/24/house-of-style-oral-history-cindy-crawford-i-want-my-mtv/ |work=Popdust |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her other objective, in her role as show's creator and producer, was to "democratize" fashion by making it more accessible to average viewers. She later spoke of her vision for the show, "I just felt like I had to have a viewer in mind. I thought that the [[Midwest]] girl was really the person that I wanted to appeal to."&lt;ref name=mtv/&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Bellettini was born on October 1, 1954, in [[Napa, California]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; She began her career at a [[radio station]] before joining the staff of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

===''House of Style''===
In September 1988, Bellettini was hired by [[MTV News]] as a segment producer.&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt; MTV, which had only launched in 1981, was still a relatively young cable network at that point, but had become a strong influencer of pop culture.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; One of Bellettini's first assignments at MTV News was to interview the [[Beastie Boys]], which Bellettini recalled in 2012, "They said, “Go interview the Beastie Boys.” It was so much fun–they poured beer on my head."&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt;

Soon after Bellettini joined MTV, a network's executive, [[Doug Herzog]], announced that MTV News would start covering [[fashion]], in addition to its existing coverage of the [[music industry]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt; Bellettini, who had been promoted to news writer, was a logical choice to write the copy for fashion stories in the small news department, "I was always stylish. And the two other writers in the news department, one was a [[Rastafarian]] and the other was reading Hitler books all the time."&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt; However, [[Kurt Loder]], the main on-camera anchor at MTV News, was deeply uncomfortable with his new role covering the fashion.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt; Bellettini recalled in the 2012 interview for ''I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution'', recalled the awkward on-air transitions between music and fashion news, "Kurt Loder was our main news anchor, and fashion stories had to come out of Kurt’s mouth. He was not comfortable doing it. The look on his face, going from a [[Guns N’ Roses]] story to a fashion story–he looked like he was about to die."&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt;

Bellettini and other staffers soon received a [[memorandum|memo]] from MTV's then-chief executive, [[Tom Freston]], questioning why Kurt Loder was reporting fashion news.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt; Bellettini read Freston's memo and conceived the idea of a new show focused on fashion, "That night, I wrote up a paragraph saying we should do a show about style."&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt; Doug Herzog replied to the proposal within 24 hours, granting Bellettini a budget for the new show.&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt; Herzog also told her that she needed to find a new host. Bellettini's first suggested [[Johnny Rotten]], the former lead vocalist of the [[Sex Pistols]], as host.&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt; However, Rotten was unavailable for the show.&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt;

Herzog told Bellettini is find an alternative host, since they could not get Rotten.&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt; He suggested that she read [[fashion magazine]]s to find a possible host, since the proposed show was focused on fashion.&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt; Bellettini, who had never read fashion magazines before, but noticed that the major models of the time were being called [[supermodel]]s.&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt; She wanted a potential host who was firmly rooted in the fashion industry, but could also attract male viewers.&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt; Bellettini decided on Cindy Crawford, a pick supported by Herzog, who had noticed her in his wife's magazines.&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt; However, Crawford's manager and [[modeling agency]] both said no to MTV's offer to have Crawford host the show.&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt; Crawford later explained her manager's reluctance to accept the offer, "My agents thought it was a waste of my time. I was making so much money [[model (people)|modeling]], per day, why take away from that? Other than [[Elsa Klensch]] on [[CNN]], there was no fashion on TV. Look at how much TV has changed since then. Now, of course, an agent would say, "Yes, you should do it. And you should do a blog."&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt;

Undaunted, Bellettini asked Crawford's representatives to Crawford call her directly about the hosting offer.&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt; Cindy Crawford called Bellettini back and immediately agreed to host the show for free, as there was no budget for Crawford's salary.&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt;

House of Style debuted in May 1989 to high ratings.&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt; Herzog [[high-fived]] Bellettini once news of the ratings reached MTV's offices.&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt;

Bellettini remained the producer of ''House of Style'' during its original run from May 1989 until 2000.&lt;ref name=mtv/&gt; The show had an immediate effect on youth and popular culture.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; ''House of Style'' is credited with transforming Cindy Crawford's career, "Especially before the days of [[social media]], it gave me an opportunity for people to know me as a person and not just in two dimensions," she later noted in 2012.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Bellettini also supported the career of designer Todd Oldham, by having him host regularly segment known as "Todd Time" during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; ''House of Style'' profiled designers, models and other figures within the industry that may have been little known to average Americans, with the goal of "democratizing fashion", including [[Naomi Campbell]], [[Anna Sui]] and [[Marc Jacobs]] during their early careers.&lt;ref name=mtv/&gt;&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt; Bellettini also recruited musicians and other celebrities to appear with Crawford during its early years, including [[Nick Rhodes]], [[Onyx (group)|Onyx]], and [[Will Smith]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=popdust/&gt;

''House of Style'' ran for 78 episodes during its original run.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; Cindy Crawford remained the show's host for the series' first six years.&lt;ref name=emmys&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Alisa Bellettini obituary |url=http://www.emmys.com/bios/alisa-bellettini |work=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] |date=2016-04-16 |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was succeeded by a string of guest hosts after Crawford's departure, including [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[Amber Valletta]] and [[Molly Sims]].&lt;ref name=emmys/&gt; ''House of Style'' was ultimately trimmed down from a weekly series to an annual special before its cancellation in 2000.&lt;ref name=emmys/&gt;

Bellettini was also involved in other television projects, including ''[[Fox/MTV Guide to Summer '92]]'' as a segment producer.&lt;ref name=emmys/&gt;

A [[documentary]] on the history of the show and its cultural impact, ''House of Style: Music, Models and MTV'', aired on MTV on August 7, 2012.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; Bellettini, Crawford, Herzog and other important figures from ''House of Style'' appeared on the documentary.&lt;ref name=emmys/&gt; ''House of Style'' was relaunched online by MTV in 2012 and 2014.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

Most recently, Bellettini had been focusing on a beauty [[blog]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Alisa Bellettini died in her sleep at her sister's home in [[Sacramento, California]], on February 16, 2016, at the age of 61.&lt;ref name=mtv/&gt;

==Personal Life==
Asante was previously married to producer Charlie Hanson. She is now married to Søren Pedersen, spokesman for European police in the Hague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/18/amma-asante-belle-bicultural-ghanaian-british-director-grange-hill|title=Amma Asante: 'I'm bi-cultural, I walk the division that Belle walked every day'|last1=Kellaway|first1=Kate|authorlink=Kate Kellaway|date=18 May 2014|newspaper=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing and Directing Career ==
Amma Asante’s career started when she first attended a performing arts school that allowed her to draft her first sitcom script.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later, she became a child actress and made her first appearances in [[Grange Hill|''Grange Hill'']] and [[Desmond's|''Desmonds'']].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hockenhull|first=Stella|date=2017|title=British Women Film Directors in the New Millennium|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/978-1-137-48992-0|language=en-gb|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-48992-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her late teens, Asante left acting and worked in screenwriting with a development deal from Chrysalis. She founded a production company, Tantrum Films, where she wrote and produced two series of the (BBC2) drama ''Brothers and Sisters'' (1998).  

Asante used Tantrum Films to make her directorial debut with a feature film, ''[[A Way of Life]]'' (2004).&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; It was developed and financed through the [[UK Film Council]] and produced by Peter Edwards, Patrick Cassavetti and [[Golden Globe Award]] and [[BAFTA Award]] winner [[Charlie Hanson]]. Her first film, [[A Way of Life|''A Way of Life'']], focused on the life of a single mother, played by [[Stephanie James]]. It details the reality of a woman who recounts the suicidal death of her mother and the presence of foster care. It also introduces her brother Gavin, played by Nathan Jones, who was also taken into foster care.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a young seventeen-year-old, Leigh Anne (''[[Stephanie James]]''), finds it difficult to get by, especially due to the medical expenses that her daughter Eli Williams, incurred. It also touches on the theme of racism, with their neighbour Hassan Osman (played by [[Oliver Haden]]), who had been the victim of a beating, after being accused of reporting Leigh Anne to social services for child neglect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The film has been described as ‘one of the most warmly received UK titles in the London Film Festival in the autumn and a harrowing drama in social realist mode’.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On 17 January 2005, the ''[[The Times|Times]]'' said, "She is one of the most exciting prospects in British cinema to emerge in the past 12 months".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/article2396731.ece|title=South Bank Show Breakthrough Star|work=The Times|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2004, the [[London Film Festival]] awarded Asante the inaugural [[Alfred Dunhill]] UK Film Talent Award.&lt;ref&gt;[[BFI London Film Festival#2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2005 Asante was awarded ''[[The Times]]'''s Breakthrough Artist of the Year and was nominated for Best Newcomer at both the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' and [[London Film Critics' Circle|London Film Critics]] award ceremonies. That same month at the [[BAFTA]] Film Awards, Asante received the [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer#The Carl Foreman Award for Special Achievement by a British Writer, Director or Producer in their First Feature Film|Carl Foreman Award for Special Achievement by a British Writer, director, or Producer in Their First Feature Film]], which she has since cited as being a big break in her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Race film joy for debut director | work = | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 13 February 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/4261623.stm | format = | doi = | accessdate =25 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://guru.bafta.org/60-seconds-withamma-asante |title=60 Seconds With...

Asante has developed film projects in both the UK and US. Her second feature film, ''[[Belle (2013 film)|Belle]]'' (2013), is a sub-genre of both feminism and racism.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Jessica|date=2018-09-26|title=‘How Can I be Too High in Rank to Dine with the Servants, but Too Low to Dine with My Family?’: Intersectionality and Postfeminism in Amma Asante's Belle|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-0424.12403|journal=Gender &amp; History|language=en|doi=10.1111/1468-0424.12403|issn=0953-5233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is based on [[Dido Elizabeth Belle]], and depicts an illegitimate mixed-race daughter of an enslaved African woman and a British navy captain. They placed the girl with his uncle (and Belle's great-uncle) [[Lord Mansfield]] and his wife in late 18th-century London.&lt;ref name="empireonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/empireblogs/words-from-the-wise/post/p1406|title=Toronto 2013: Starred Up, Belle, The Invisible Woman, Dom Hemingway, The Double &amp;#124; The Empire Blog|publisher=empireonline.com|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this film, Dido was being raised by a white aristocratic family and acquired many intellectual skills. Dido uses her personal experiences to debate the social and structural issues of her time, like the patriarchy and lack of representation for visible minorities. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Dido’s role in the film has been said to be “a way that is usually denied to historical black women”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The film touches on the [[Zong massacre|Zong]] marine case, where the Captain falsely claims damages from his insurer for the loss of his 133 enslaved Africans.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Captain was not able to get compensated, so his case was escalated to the higher court, where Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, (Dido’s great-uncle and guardian), was in charge of. The film stars Academy Award nominees [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Lord Mansfield, who as a justice, ruled on two important cases related to slavery; [[Emily Watson]] as his wife and [[Miranda Richardson]], alongside rising stars [[Sarah Gadon]], [[Tom Felton]], and [[Sam Reid (actor)|Sam Reid]], with [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] as the eponymous [[Dido Elizabeth Belle]].

The critics point out that her poetry is loaded with eroticism —what has the controversy between readers—, ad at the same time has a perspective of gender, that is to say, that is very feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laotrarevista.com/2010/03/ana-istaru-costa-rica-1960/|title=Ana Istarú, Costa Rica, 1960|work=laotrarevista.com|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it Istarú expresses without any fear the deepest feelings of the woman. “Filled with high erotic temperature sustained from beginning to end, expresses  in a personal and strict vocabulary attaining in so difficult subject, a harmony of moving expression with a government infalible of the form”, said the jury of the Latin American Prize EDUCA based on the quoted book awarded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editorialcostarica.com/catalogo.cfm?detalle=1446 Citado en la presentación de ''Poesía escogida. '']&lt;/ref&gt;

The pieces of Istarú, always current, have been mounted not only in Costa Rica, but also in other countries of America, included the United States, and Europe. It suffices to say, for taking only one work, that ''pickled Men'', with its showing in [[Portugal]], arrived in 2010 "to his thirtieth fourth professional première abroad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacion.com/2010-05-18/Entretenimiento/NotaPrincipal/Entretenimiento2374041.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523033116/http://www.nacion.com/2010-05-18/Entretenimiento/NotaPrincipal/Entretenimiento2374041.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 23, 2010 |title=Estrenan obra de Istarú en Portugal |work=archive.org |accessdate=3 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director María Bonilla, with the University Theatre, chose O''ur Mother that are on the earth'' to inaugurate the 2010 season in Costa Rica, signaled related to this piece that treats four generations of women that have to confront the paper that society imposes them and the one who impose  on themselves: “Women have to work on the construction of our identity, far from social conventions, of repressive education &amp;nbsp;that we have received and of the masculine perspective, all elements that are important and it is necessary to take into account, but that are not those that have to define us”.&lt;ref name="madre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcultura.com/php/Articulos422.htm|title=- ana istar  natalia arias  mara bonilla  Mara Orozco  Lolita Aguilar  lelos fonseca  Madre nuestra que ests en la tierra  mujeres  sociedad costarricense  teatro universitario redcultura  red  cultura  - RedCultura|work=RedCultura|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Istarú comments: “I conceived it after doing a reflection on families that reiterate from generation to generation, and that many times the same women transmitted the sexist values that obey their conception of social patriarchy”.&lt;ref name="madre"/&gt;

The repertoire of Istarú as an actress of theater includes leading papers in classical and contemporary works. She has dabbled in cinema, exerting papers in Costa Rican films and TV shows (for example, in ''This they call home'') and also co-wrote with the director Esteban Ramírez the script of ''Caribbean'', film starred by the Cuban [[Jorge Perugorría]] and rewarded in festivals.&lt;ref name="si"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130412055800/http://sicultura.go.cr/component/sicultura/articulo/ana-istaru-745.html Ana Istarú en el Sistema de Información Cultural Costarricense], acceso 17.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work, the poetic as well as like dramatic, and her work as an actress have won several prizes. American and European anthologies have selected his poems, that have also have been translated to diverse languages, like &amp;nbsp;German, French, Dutch, English and Italian.

As of 2002, Istarú writes columns of opinion, in the weekly newspaper ''The Financial'' as well as in the Sunday magazine, Proa,&amp;nbsp;of ''[[La Nación (San José)|The Nation.]]''&amp;nbsp;In&amp;nbsp;2010 they were gathered in the book ''101 articles'', saying: “My style of writing does not look for the objectivity, is scandalously subjective with eagerness to seduce the reader with games of words, rhythms, but, especially, with ideas”.&lt;ref name="aldea"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101105154627/http://www.nacion.com/2010-11-02/AldeaGlobal/NotasSecundarias/AldeaGlobal2575345.aspx Andrea Solano B.

==Plot==
Zoe (Sharon Hinnendael) and Mal (Jill Evyn) meet while filming a movie where they're cast as lovers. They end up falling in love in the process and all seems to go well until months later when Mal abandons her lover just when Zoe's career starts to really take off. While it appears that Mal had little reason to leave her lover, the truth is that Mal was formerly an addict and is afraid that Zoe will leave her so she left Zoe before this could happen. The two end up being drawn back together when they're called back by Kara (Marina Rice Bader) to re-shoot their love scene.The two initially have a problem acting as both have pent-up feelings for each other however Anne Pasternak(Constance Brenneman) helps them to work professionally. Anne also comforts both Zoe and Mal individually and keeps their confidence afloat. Zoe gets a call from her agent who tells her that she should not have any shooting today. Zoe is then suspicious and calls out on Kara. Kara then reveals to Zoe that there is no broadcast deal and she did this to ensure Zoe and Mal got back together. Zoe is upset upon hearing this so she starts having a nervous breakdown. Anne once again helps calm the situation and Mal also calms Zoe down and kisses her. This decreases the tension between them and they are finally able to shoot the first scene. Everyone is happy that they can move to the next shot. Zoe and Mal have a moment together and Zoe questions her why Mal left her. Mal explains her reason but Zoe is still upset and they end up arguing which prompts Kara and Anne to intervene, this finally leads to Kara revealing that there was no broadcast deal and that Kara was amazed to see Zoe and Mal fall in love with each other six months ago on the same set. She wanted Zoe and Mal to get back together and prove that love does exist. Kara then ends up canceling the shooting and packs up. Anne follows and demands to know the whole truth as she had worked for 15 years with Kara. Anne also tells her that she wanted Kara to notice her efforts. Kara then replies that Anne has always done an amazing job and that she is Anne's biggest Fan. Anne then tells Kara that she loves her and kisses Kara(which surprises her). Mal and Zoe continue to argue, Zoe tells Mal that she is exactly like her mother. This upsets Mal who locks herself in the restroom. Zoe apologizes for what she said and tries to console her but Mal does not give in. Zoe then leaves and sits in the middle of the road. Mal then comes searching for her and the two end up staring at each other with tears in both of their eyes. 
The scene then cuts the first 6 months which lead to the first scene where both Mal and Zoe fell in love with each other.

==Production==
The show was originally to be called ''Single Black Female''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |title=BET Greenlights ‘Single Black Female’ Pilot From Mara Brock Akil And Salim Akil |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/02/bet-greenlights-single-black-female-pilot-from-mara-brock-akil-and-salim-akil/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=April 20, 2013 |date=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series centers on successful [[broadcast journalist]] Mary Jane Paul (played by [[Gabrielle Union]]) and her professional and private family life while searching for "Mr. Right":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mary Jane Paul has it all: she's a successful TV news anchor, entirely self-sufficient – an all-around powerhouse who remains devoted to a family that doesn’t share her motivation. As Mary Jane juggles her life, her work and her commitment to her family, we find out how far she's willing to go to find the puzzle pieces that she, and society, insist are missing from her life as a single Black female.&lt;ref name=rbr&gt;{{cite web |title=BET unveils new programming at Upfront |url=http://rbr.com/bet-unveils-new-programming-at-upfront/ |publisher=Radio &amp; Television Business Report |accessdate=July 6, 2013 |date=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Omari Hardwick]] plays a potential Mr. Right.  Other cast members include [[Latarsha Rose]], [[Lisa Vidal]], [[Aaron D. Spears]], [[Richard Roundtree]], [[Margaret Avery]], [[Richard Brooks (actor)|Richard Brooks]], [[Tika Sumpter]], [[Raven Goodwin]], [[B.J. Britt]], and [[Robinne Lee]].&lt;ref name=rbr/&gt;

The series is produced by [[Mara Brock Akil]], who produced BET's most successful series ever, ''[[The Game (U.S. TV series)|The Game]]'', and the romantic comedy film ''[[Jumping the Broom]]''. The pilot episode was filmed in April 2012 at [[780 N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3565">'''Bon chic, bon genre''' ({{Langnf||French|"Good style, good class"}}) is an expression used in France to refer to a [[subculture]] of stylish members of the Paris [[upper class]]. They are typically well-educated, well-connected, and descended from "[[old money]]" families, preferably with some aristocratic ancestry. The style combines certain fashionable tastes with the appearance of social respectability. The expression is sometimes shortened to "BCBG"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adeleye|first=Gabriel G.|title=World dictionary of foreign expressions: a resource for readers and writers|year=1999|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers|isbn=9780865164239|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the fashion company [[BCBG Max Azria]] was named in reference to the subculture). 

Parallels are often seen between this subculture and similar upper-class social groups in the United States ("[[preppy]]") and the United Kingdom ("[[Sloane Ranger]]s").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes, Alexandra and Keith Reader|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary French Culture|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203003305|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with those groups, BCBG drew mainstream attention during the 1980s. Thierry Mantoux published a handbook for BCBG style (''BCBG - Le Guide du bon chic bon genre'') in the 1980s, a French equivalent to ''[[The Official Preppy Handbook]]'' and ''The Sloane Ranger Handbook'', both published earlier in the decade. 

The BCBG social group is not to be confused with the "[[Bobos in Paradise|bobo]]" Paris fashion subculture (short for "bohemian bourgeois").

==Fashion==
The style of BCBG tends towards the conservative and classic, to "de-emphasize 'sexiness' and 'flashy' signs of wealth", and is influenced by "Anglo-Saxon" styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raissiguier|first=Catherine|title=Becoming Women, Becoming Workers: Identity Formation in a French Vocational School|year=1994|publisher=SUNY|isbn=9781438416762|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some brands trendy with the BCBG group include [[Gucci]], [[Max Mara]], [[Le Bon Marché]], and [[Chanel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fallon|first=Stephen|title=Paris|year=2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=9781742203980|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The BCBG social group is associated with certain residential areas in Paris and Versailles. BCBG are often identified with the "NAP" area formed by the triangle between [[Neuilly-Auteuil-Passy]], from the [[16th arrondissement of Paris|16th arrondissement]] to the [[Bois de Boulogne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes, Alexandra and Keith Reader|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary French Culture|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203003305|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]] closer to the centre of Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexiou|first=Joseph|title=Paris for Dummies|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118038741|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[7th arrondissement of Paris|7th]] and [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th arrondissements]] for shopping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fallon|first=Stephen|title=Paris|year=2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=9781742203980|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canberra Symphony Orchestra''' ('''CSO''') is the professional orchestra of the [[Australian Capital Territory]] based in [[Canberra]], the national capital of [[Australia]]. 

==History==
Officially formed on 14 March 1950 and registered as the "Canberra Orchestral Society" (COS), rehearsals were originally held in the ante-room of [[Albert Hall, Canberra|Albert Hall]] under the baton of conductor Pieter Kruithof, a Dutch migrant with organ and choral background who was being employed as a cleaner. Concerts were also held in school halls and the Childers Street Hall of the [[Australian National University]].

Wilfred Holland from England, with his strong conducting and performance background, led the orchestra for much of the 60’s. He also guided the [[Canberra Choral Society]] and the two organisations held joint performances of many early choral masterpieces.

In 1965 [[Ernest Llewellyn]], former concertmaster of the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]] arrived in Canberra to take up the position of Director of the newly formed [[Canberra School of Music]]. He also was invited to the role of conductor of the Canberra Symphony. Llewellyn’s tremendous reputation made it possible for him to recruit top professional players to teach at the School and to join the orchestra. In no time the CSO was flourishing with sold-out performances at the newly opened [[Canberra Theatre]].

Ernest Llewellyn continued to strengthen and extend the orchestra until his retirement in 1980, at which time the new School of Music auditorium was officially named [[ANU School of Music#Llewellyn Hall|Llewellyn Hall]] in his honour.

The CSO was lucky to secure [[Leonard Dommett]] as the new Conductor and Musical Director in 1982. As the former Concertmaster of the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]], Dommett brought an impressive network of national and international artists to the CSO stage. Throughout the 80’s the orchestra continued to expand and artistic achievement was continually evolving.

Dommett retired in 1991 and the ensuing decade brought further change to the orchestra, including the implementation of fully professional status in 1994. Large opera gala concerts featured celebrity conductors such as [[Richard Bonynge]] and [[Isaiah Jackson]].

When [[Richard Gill (conductor)|Richard Gill]] joined the CSO as Chief Conductor and Artistic Director in 2001, the organisation was going through difficult times. He brought much needed consistency and stability to the orchestra – and within a couple of years after his arrival, the CSO was back on a solid financial footing.

Dr [[Nicholas Milton]] took up the baton as Chief Conductor and Artistic Director in 2007 and his passion, vision and expertise has inspired players and audiences alike. Milton is a rising Australian conductor now based in Germany who was also a former violinist with the Macquarie Trio. Also in 2007 the CSO received Commonwealth Government funding for the first time which has allowed for additional rehearsals and larger orchestras on stage.

For the Canberra Centenary season of 2013, the [[ACT Government]] enlisted the CSO to perform the World Premiere of a commissioned work by [[Andrew Schultz]], ''Symphony No. 3 – Century'', as a feature of the official Canberra Day celebrations in March 2013.

'''Carolina Maria Benedicks-Bruce''' (28 October 1856 – 16 February 1935) was a Swedish sculptor. After studies at the Academy of Arts in Sweden she went to France, at first to study and later to live and work at the artists' colony in [[Grez-sur-Loing]] where she met her husband [[William Blair Bruce]]. With him she returned to Sweden and together they created the artists estate [[Brucebo]] on [[Gotland]], which was later established as a [[nature reserve]]. She also worked actively with the preservation of heritage buildings, [[Women's suffrage|women's right to vote]] and establishing the [[Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Service]].

== Early life and education ==
Benedicks, born on 28 October 1856 in Stockholm, was the daughter of Karolina Charlotta (born Cantzler) and Edward Otto Benedicks,&lt;ref name=Gustaf/&gt; wealthy owner of Gysinge, a part of [[Sandviken]] [[ironworks]].&lt;ref name=gun&gt;{{cite web|last1=Westholm|first1=Gun|title=Carolina Benedicks Bruce|url=http://www.gotland.net/sv/att-gora/carolina-benedicks-bruce|website=www.gotland.net|publisher=Gotlands Media AB|accessdate=12 July 2015|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother, Gustaf Benedicks, inherited the iron works and was a member of the Swedish [[Riksdag]].&lt;ref name=Gustaf&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Boëthius|first=B G.|encyclopedia=Svenskt biografiskt lexikon|title=Gustaf Benedicks|url=http://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=18469|access-date=12 July 2015 |language=Swedish|date=1922|publisher=[[National Archives of Sweden]]|volume=3|pages=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also had a sister and two half-siblings from her father's second marriage. Her half-brother was physicist [[Carl Benedicks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lyrholm|first1=Christer|title=Edvard Otto Benedicks|url=http://www.geni.com/people/Edvard-Otto-Benedicks/6000000008996616009|website=www.geni.com|publisher=Geni|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were many artists on her mother's side of the family: several of her uncles and her grandmother were painters, among them Johan Oscar Cantzler and Axel Leopold Cantzler. It was through them that Benedicks' artistry was cultivated and developed.&lt;ref name=gun /&gt; She started at the August Malmström art school for women,&lt;ref name=idun /&gt; and from 20{{nbsp}}August 1881 until the spring of 1885,&lt;ref name=kvinnor&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hedberg|first1=Walborg|last2=Arosenius|first2=Louise|title=Svenska kvinnor|date=1914|publisher=Albert Bonniers Förlag|location=Stockholm|page=9|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/33654/1/gupea_2077_33654_1.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2015|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; she became the first female student in the sculpture class at the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]].&lt;ref name=riks&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Mörner|first=Stellan G.|encyclopedia=Svenskt biografiskt lexikon|title=Carolina M Benedicks-Bruce|url=http://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=18472 |access-date=12 July 2015 |language=Swedish|date=1922|publisher=[[National Archives of Sweden]]|volume=3|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== France ==
Benedicks met other female artists at the academy including [[Hilma af Klint]] and Gerda Rydberg with whom she travelled to France in 1883. Most of their time was spent in Paris and at the Swedish artist colony in Grez-sur-Loing.&lt;ref name=idun&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hagéus|first1=Elsa|title=Brucebo och dess härskarinna|trans-title=Brucebo and its matron|journal=Idun|date=27 March 1910|volume=1212|issue=13|pages=154–156|url=http://www.ub.gu.se/fasta/laban/erez/kvinnohistoriska/tidskrifter/idun/1910/pdf/1910_13.pdf|accessdate=12 July 2015|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing her studies at the academy in Stockholm, she returned to France where she became the student of sculptor [[Alexandre Falguière]].&lt;ref name=riks /&gt; She also returned to Grez-sur-Loing, where many of the more prominent Scandinavian painters at the time would gather during the 1880s. Benedicks met with artists such as [[Carl Larsson]] and his wife [[Karin Bergöö Larsson]], [[Bruno Liljefors]], [[Christian Krohg]] and [[Peder Severin Krøyer]]. In Grez, the Swedish artists created their own, criticized "salon" called ''Le Salon des Opposants''.&lt;ref name=grez&gt;{{cite web|title=Venez à Grez! Venez à Grez!|trans-title=Come to Grez!

Being a single female, with a good artistic education and coming from a wealthy family who encouraged her artistic aspirations, set Benedicks apart from the rest of the artists in the colony. At the time, this was a predominantly male environment, with artists of small means.&lt;ref name=AGH&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lundgren|first1=Jan O.|editor=Bill Manson|title=The Bruce-Benedicks Saga and the Birth of the AGH|url=http://www.artgalleryofhamilton.com/aa_brucebo.php|website=www.artgalleryofhamilton.com|publisher=[[Art Gallery of Hamilton]]|accessdate=24 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923174108/http://www.artgalleryofhamilton.com/aa_brucebo.php|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Benedicks was foremost a sculptor, but she also worked with [[etching]]s and [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]]. Her sculptures are heavily influenced by the French style of the 1870s and 1880s, while her paintings and etchings are mostly landscapes and animals. Her works were exhibited for the first time at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in Paris in 1899, where she participated with her sculpture ''L'obsédé''.&lt;ref name=idun /&gt; She participated in the Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] in 1900, where she was awarded a bronze medal,&lt;ref name=kvinnor /&gt; and later in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=riks /&gt;

When making [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]], Benedicks worked in [[marble]] and [[bronze]]. ''Michel Angelo'', a bronze bust, depicts [[Michelangelo]] as a thoughtful ordinary man working on something, rather than an exalted genius.&lt;ref name=idun /&gt; She also made busts of [[Gotland Museum#Pehr Arvid Säve|P.A. Säve]] and sculptor [[Emil Wikström]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carolina Benedicks-Bruce 1856–1935|url=http://www.signaturer.se/Sverige/CarolinaBenedicks.htm|website=www.signaturer.se|publisher=Signaturer.se|accessdate=27 August 2015|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her study of the human anatomy resulted in a humoristic sculpture called ''Séance finie'' or "''The yawning''".&lt;ref name=idun /&gt;

Several of Benedicks' sculptures, [[Watercolor painting|aquarelles]] and sketches are still at Brucebo, for example ''L'obsédé'' (''"The Obsessed"''),&lt;ref name=SLU&gt;{{cite web|last1=Svännel|first1=Jessica|title=Vårdprogram för trädgården på Brucebo|trans-title=Care program for the garden at Brucebo|url=http://jessicasvannel.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/V%C3%A5rdprogram-f%C3%B6r-Brucebo_12juni14_JessicaSv%C3%A4nnel.pdf|website=www.jessicasvannel.se|publisher=[[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences]]|accessdate=11 July 2015|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Baigneur blessé'' (''"The wounded bather"'') that won the ''Mention Honorable'' at the Salon in Paris in 1893.&lt;ref name=stiftelsen&gt;{{cite web|title=Carolina Benedicks-Bruce|url=http://brucebostiftelsen.wix.com/brucebo#!carolina-benedicks-bruce|website=www.brucebostiftelsen.wix.com|publisher=Brucebo Foundation|accessdate=13 July 2015|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
[[File:Carolina Benedicks-Bruce and William Blair Bruce.jpg|thumb|upright|Carolina Benedicks-Bruce and William Blair Bruce]]
Benedicks met artist [[William Blair Bruce]] in France in the spring of 1885.&lt;ref name="stiftelsen" /&gt; Bruce was still a poor and unknown artist at the time, but a voyage back to Canada in the autumn that year, during which he lost most of his paintings in a shipwreck earned him some notoriety. Benedicks, accompanied by her uncle, made a surprise visit to Canada and Bruce shortly after. Following long discussions, the couple got engaged within a year, against the will of Benedicks' family. They returned to Europe in 1887, where they alternated between Stockholm and Paris. They got married in 1888, and visited Gotland for the first time that year.&lt;ref name=gun /&gt;&lt;ref name=AGH /&gt; Theirs was one of many international marriages that came to be as a result of the mixed artist colony in Grez-sur-Loing. Another noted pair was the American painter [[Francis Brooks Chadwick]] and Swedish painter [[Emma Chadwick|Emma Löwstädt-Chadwick]].&lt;ref name=grez /&gt; After the marriage the couple moved to Paris, probably to escape the scrutiny of the Benedicks family. For several years they lived a bohemian life and traveled around Europe to paint and study.&lt;ref name=AGH /&gt;

== Brucebo ==
{{main|Brucebo}}
[[File:Carolina Benedicks-Bruce in Brucebo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Carolina Benedicks-Bruce with dogs and goats in Brucebo]]
In 1899, Benedicks-Bruce and her husband decided to settle down on Gotland. They bought properties in Själsö at what was to become Brucebo, north of Visby, and started to rebuild and extend the houses on the estate.&lt;ref name=gun /&gt; Benedicks-Bruce had the money for the project and Bruce was the chief architect.&lt;ref name=blair&gt;{{cite web|title=En William Blair kommer hem|trans-title=A William Blair comes home|url=http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/gotland/Sv/nyheter/2011/Pages/en-william-blair-kommer-hem.aspx?keyword=brucebo+naturreservat|website=www.lansstyrelsen.se|publisher=The County Administrative Boards of [[Gotland County]]|accessdate=27 August 2015|date=8 April 2011|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; They moved to Brucebo in 1900. When Bruce died in 1906, she stayed on in Brucebo and continued with her work. The estate became a social hub for artists, musicians and scientists on Gotland, with Benedicks-Bruce as a generous hostess.&lt;ref name=gun /&gt; She had three workshops at Brucebo and she also kept a number of animals on the estate, such as cows, horses, sheep, goats, dogs, chickens, parrots, monkeys, that she tended to herself.&lt;ref name=idun /&gt; Her interest in [[self-sufficiency]] had started in Grez-sur-Loing, where many of the artists had small gardens where they grew their own vegetables, herbs, fruits and berries. She had great plans for the garden and even brought back seeds from France to plant, as well as hiring a gardener. However, the extension of buildings and other architectural improvements came to a halt with Bruce's death.&lt;ref name=SLU /&gt;

She lived at Brucebo until her death on 16 February 1935.&lt;ref name="stiftelsen" /&gt; She had no children to inherit from her,&lt;ref name=blair /&gt; and in her will she stated that Brucebo should remain a place where young artists could stay and develop their artistry.&lt;ref name=SLU /&gt; In 1972, this was realized with the creation of the [[Brucebo#Brucebo Foundation|Brucebo Fine Art Scholarship Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brucebo and W.B. Bruce Fine Art Scholarships for Canadian Artists|url=http://www.swedenabroad.com/en-GB/Embassies/Ottawa/Study-in-Sweden/Scholarships/Brucebo-and-WB-Bruce-Fine-Art-Scholarships-2012-2013/|website=www.swedenabroad.com|publisher=[[List of diplomatic missions in Ottawa|Embassy of Sweden, Ottawa]]|accessdate=14 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709022007/http://www.swedenabroad.com/en-GB/Embassies/Ottawa/Study-in-Sweden/Scholarships/Brucebo-and-WB-Bruce-Fine-Art-Scholarships-2012-2013/#|archive-date=2015-07-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social commitments ==
Benedicks-Bruce was a unique and strong woman for her time, engaged in political and social issues and has been called a Swedish "[[Emmeline Pankhurst|Mrs. Pankhurst]]".&lt;ref name=idun /&gt; Among the things she fought for was the women's right to vote. When the [[Sixth Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] was held in Stockholm in 1911, she invited the delegates to Gotland. About 40 of them from Germany, England, Austria and Hungary accepted and came to [[Visby]] on 21{{nbsp}}June. She also worked with Gotlandic questions and was one of the most ardent advocates for the preservation of the ''Burmeisterska huset'', a 17th-century house in Visby. She was also a key figure in the establishment of the Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Service on Gotland.&lt;ref name=gun /&gt;

In 1911, she was a member of the [[Väskinde]] school council and a year later, part of the Väskinde Fruit Growers Association. In 1913, she became a member of the Väskinde Municipality Counsil.&lt;ref name=kvinnor /&gt; Benedicks-Bruce also made generous donations to the conservation of heritage buildings, childcare and [[orphanage]]s.&lt;ref name=blair /&gt;

'''''Contre Sainte-Beuve''''' ({{IPA-fr|kɔ̃tʁ sɛ̃t bœv|lang}}, "Against [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]]") is an unfinished book of essays written by [[Marcel Proust]] between 1895 and 1900 and first published posthumously in 1954. The book was discovered, with its pages in order, amongst Proust's papers after his death. It consists of several essays, three of which refute the body of work written by [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]], a French literary critic active in the early to mid-nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/Contre_Saint-Beuve|title=Contre Saint-Beuve|last=Shapiro|first=Michael|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16191">Despite being an imported tradition, [[Comics|comic art]] had a significant impact on [[Myanmar|Burmese]] visual culture.  Comic art is a form of visual expression defined by sequences of juxtaposed panels containing stylised images with bold outlines which incorporate text or symbols as an integral part of the narrative.  Introduced by members of the British colonial elite, who were also amateur artists, cartooning and comic art was embraced by Burmese artists as a new mode of visual and critical expression.  First appearing in the early 1910s, within two decades comics and cartoons emerged as a significant vehicle by which political and social criticism could be made within Burma's restricted public arena.&lt;ref&gt;Aung Soe Min, “Comic Culture in Myanmar: When Lines Shine a Light in the Darkness,” Goethe Institut, accessed April 30, 2016, https://www.goethe.de/ins/mm/en/kul/mag/20697882.html.&lt;/ref&gt;   As the number of print publications in Burma grew, from 22 in 1911 to 103 in 1921 and finally to over 200 by the close of the 1930s, comics became a substantial avenue for entertainment, art and discourse.&lt;ref&gt;John A Lent, Asian Comics (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2015), 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and influences ==
The first cartoon published in Burma appeared in the [[The Rangoon Times|''Rangoon Times'']] in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 175.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cartoon was created by Martin Jones, the British commissioner of Burma's railways.  It depicted a young [[Bamar people|Burmese]] woman who attended a Western party and was subsequently humiliated.&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Pioneers of Burmese Cartooning,” ''Irrawaddy'' 11,  no. 7 (2003), accessed April 30, 2016, http://www2.irrawaddy.com/article.php?art_id=3069&amp;page=1.&lt;/ref&gt;   Jones published the derogatory illustration under the pseudonym Myauk, the derivation of the Burmese term ''myauk phyu'' meaning ‘white monkey’.&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 175.&lt;/ref&gt;   A term the Burmese used to refer to the British colonial forces who [[British rule in Burma|occupied Burma]] from 1824 to 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Thompson, “Burma,” in ''South East Asia: Colonial History - Vol IV'', ed. Paul H Kratoska (London: Routledge, 2001), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones along with fellow amateur colonial painters physics professor Kenneth Ward and principal of St. Mathews High School in [[Mawlamyaing|Moulmien]] E G N Kinch founded the [[Burma Art Club]] in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”; Andrew Ranard, ''Burmese Painting: A Linear and Lateral History'' (Chiang Mai: Silkworm Publications, 2009), 91; cf Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 175, Lent suggests that the Burma Art Club was established in 1917.  This may be a confusion surrounding the date of the Club’s founding which occurred in 1913 and its formalisation which followed in 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;   Their efforts were assisted by Commissioner Hla Aung and his partner Mya May, along with several young Burmese artists including Ba Zaw, [[Ba Nyan]], Tha Dun, Tun Hla, and [[Ba Kyi]].&lt;ref&gt;Ranard, ''Burmese Painting'', 91-2; Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 175.&lt;/ref&gt;   Located on the grounds of the Rangoon Government High School,&lt;ref&gt;Irene Moilanen and Sergeĭ Sergeevich Ozhegov, ''Mirrored in Wood: Burmese Art and Architecture'' (Bangkok: White Lotus Press, 1999), 162.&lt;/ref&gt;  the Burma Art Club was a colonial art institution with the objective of promoting Western-style painting and drawing, including cartooning, to select Burmese students.&lt;ref&gt;Ranard, ''Burmese Painting'', 92-3.&lt;/ref&gt;   It has been suggested by art historian Andrew Ranard that: {{Quote|text=Burmese students who studied cartoon art at the Burma Art Club felt some affinity for this new genre because it possessed elements of exaggeration with which they were already familiar in Traditional painting… Pagan painting and the mural painting of Burma from the 17th to 19th centuries had a strong taste for caricature in its depictions of fairy-tale figures, demons, and beasts…&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}} Among the first initiates to receive training from the establishment were the now notable Burmese cartoonists [[Shwe Yoe|Ba Gale]], also known as Shwe Talay or Shwe Yoe, and [[Ba Gyan]].&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 175.&lt;/ref&gt;   It is considered that the beginning of Burma's comic art movement was defined by these individuals.&lt;ref&gt;John A Lent, “Cartooning in Southeast Asia,” in ''Encyclopedia of Humour Studies'', ed. Salvatore Attardo  (Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, 2014), 725.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ba Gale ==
{{Main|Shwe Yoe}}Ba Gale (1893-1945) was a formative figure in Burma's burgeoning comic art scene.  His career began in 1915, after publishing a cartoon in the ''Rangoon College Annual Magazine'' at the age of 22.&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”; Myo Thant, “Social Critics, Satirists and Humourists” (paper presented at the National Workshop on Copyright: Myanmar’s Gateway to IP, Yangon, September 7, 2005), accessed April 30, 2016, http://www.accu.or.jp/appreb/02/02-02/02-02country/previous/prev_mm.html.&lt;/ref&gt;   Crucially, he was the first artist to draw and publish a cartoon in the Burmese language, which appeared in ''Thuriya'', a publication run by young nationalists, in March 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 175.&lt;/ref&gt;   Earning 10-15 kyat per cartoon (approximately AU $0.17) Ba Gale sought to make cartooning his career.&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”.&lt;/ref&gt;   His works subsequently appeared in the [[The Rangoon Times|''Rangoon Times'']] and as part of the editorial pages in other smaller local newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ba Gale Shwedagon Comic.png|thumb|Ba Gale, Shwedagon shoe controversy comic, c. 1917]]

Ba Gale's style drew heavily from the European tradition of [[caricature]].  During his time at the Burma Art Club, he was introduced to and subscribed to the British comic publication ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', known for its political and social satire.&lt;ref&gt;Ranard, ''Burmese Painting'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite being acknowledged as an adept artist and an astute pictorial commentator, the Burmese public initially found it difficult to understand and interpret Ba Gale's exaggerated and stylised drawing style.&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”; Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 175;  This would seem to contradict Ranard’s assertion that elements of caricature could be identified in early Burmese temple paintings making the style familiar.  Perhaps the similarities were clearer for individuals with an artist training and background, such as the students of the Burma Art Club as opposed to the general Burmese population.&lt;/ref&gt;   Writer and social historian Aung Zaw notes that: {{Quote|text=To gain popular acceptance, Ba Gale’s cartoons were often accompanied by long captions or described poetically by editors.  During British rule, captions often appeared in English. Respected Burmese literary figure Sayagyi Thakin Kodaw Hmaing edited The Sun and wrote many captions for Ba Gale, contributing to the public’s appreciation of the cartoonist…&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”; see also Aung Soe Min, “Comic Culture in Myanmar”.&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Even in its earliest stages, Burmese comic art was political.  Despite being a regular fixture within the English-language periodicals that circulated throughout Burma, Ba Gale's works often parodied the British administration.&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 176; Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”; Aung Soe Min, “Comic Culture in Myanmar”.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he did not limit his critique to the colonialists.  He also used  comic art to critic prominent social issues such as opportunistic politicians and what he perceived as sycophantic behaviour towards the British.&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 176; Aung Soe Min, “Comic Culture in Myanmar”.&lt;/ref&gt;   Considered one of Ba Gale's most famous cartoons is his portrayal of the 1917 resolution to forbid colonial forces from wearing shoes within the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]; an act which was forbidden by Burmese religious custom.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Moore, Hansjörg Mayer and U Win Pe, ''Shwedagon: Golden Pagoda of Myanmar'' (Bangkok: River Books, 1999), 150.&lt;/ref&gt;   Ba Gale illustrated the portly colonialists, identified by their opulent Western dress, riding on the back of Burmese people like horses so that they did not have to obey the custom of removing their shoes within the Shwedagon.  Ba Gale does not just lampoon the British and their disrespectful behaviour he also questions the attitudes of those Burmese people who assist them.&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”; Aung Soe Min, “Comic Culture in Myanmar”; Donald Seekins, ''Historical Dictionary of Burma (Myanmar)'' (Maryland: Scarecrow Press Inc, 2006), 136.&lt;/ref&gt;   Ba Gale, however, did not escape criticism entirely.  A cartoon which depicted [[Saya San|the leader]] of a 1930 peasant uprising as a hero earned him substantial condemnation from British officials, though he was never jailed.&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 176; Aung Zaw notes the leniency which cartoonists enjoyed under British rule, particularly when compared with the censorship imposed by the subsequent military juntas that ruled Burma from 1962 until 2010.  He considers that this relative freedom was an important aspect in the initial development of a Burmese comic art.&lt;/ref&gt;   Towards the mid-1920s Ba Gale transitioned into filmmaking and acting where he gained significant popularity.

== Ba Gyan ==
{{Main|Ba Gyan}} The political inclination first seen in Ba Gale's work was furthered by his contemporary Ba Gyan (1902-1953) who rose to prominence in the 1930s with his bold cartoons and nationalist agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Bertil Littner, “Avoiding the Draft,” ''Far Eastern Economic Review'' 148, vol. 3 (1991): 32.&lt;/ref&gt;   Ba Gyan, like Ba Gale, also trained at the Burma Art Club where he was singled-out by founder Martin Jones for his ‘talent, humour and desire to entertain.’&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”; see also Ranard, ''Burmese Painting'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt;   Ba Gyan's practice traversed a number of fields.  In addition to working as an editorial cartoonist, he also illustrated children's magazines, worked as a commercial photographer, novelist and animator.&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 176.&lt;/ref&gt;   Ba Gyan was instrumental in establishing the Burmese animation industry.  In 1934 and 1935 he produced Burma's first animated films, ''Kye Taungwa'' and ''Athuya'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;   Previously, Burmese comic art had been restricted to single cartons or limited panel short stories, however, in 1937 Ba Gyan created Burma's first comic book, ''Ko Pyoo and Ma Pyone''.&lt;ref&gt;Myo Thant, “Social Critics”.&lt;/ref&gt;   At this stage Ba Gyan also began to work with recurring characters whose antics would be developed and explored across the political and humour panels of several major publications.&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ba Gyan Comic.jpg|thumb|Ba Gyan, ''[[Tatmadaw]]'' (Armed Forces) political comic, first published 1952. Text running upper centre to centre right translates to, '1952 - The plan to not split the people and the Armed Forces'.]]

After Burma gained its independence in 1948, Ba Gyan's comic production became explicitly political and highly critical.&lt;ref&gt;Seekins, ''Historical Dictionary of Burma'', 136.&lt;/ref&gt;   Of particular significance was a cartoon which appeared in a local newspaper on January 4, 1948.  The comic depicted British General Sir [[Hubert Rance]] departing Burma, waving goodbye to a local family as he tells them ‘Take care of your children.’&lt;ref&gt;Aung Soe Min, “Comic Culture in Myanmar”.&lt;/ref&gt;   Behind the amicable scene are three children each symbolising a damage caused by the Second World War: debt, destruction and economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ba Gyan's use of metaphor as a communicative device shows a growing sophistication and maturing in Burma's comic art movement.   Gallerist and collector [[Aung Soe Min]] claims that the cartoon's popularity stemmed from its ability to concisely express Burma's situation at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-independence Ba Gyan took a firmly partisan stance satirising both sides of Burma's new political regime; lampooning the [[Prime Minister of Myanmar|Prime Minister]] [[U Nu]] and the opposing communist leader [[Thakin Than Tun]].&lt;ref&gt;Aung Zaw, “Burmese Cartooning”.&lt;/ref&gt;   Aung Zaw notes that Ba Gyan's influence was respected and recognised by these figures.  By the early 1950s Burma was embroiled in political turmoil and on the cusp of a civil war, in a bid to quell a social uprising Prime Minister U Nu sought a meeting with Ba Gyan asking him to only exhibit cartoons which exhibited peace and unity.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;   Famously, he refused to compromise informing U Nu that he was too busy to attend the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;   Ba Gyan, and other early cartoonists such as Hein Sung, viewed their role as ‘public watchdog’s’ who were responsible for keeping the Burma's independent power structures in check.&lt;ref&gt;Littner, “Avoiding the Draft,” 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-independence Onwards ==
The proceeding period of development in Burma's comic art which spanned from the early 1950s until the [[1962 Burmese coup d'état|military takeover of 1962]] was an era of growth and experimentation in which younger artists expanded on the visual tradition established by Ba Gale and Ba Gyan.&lt;ref&gt;Myo Thant, “Social Critics”.&lt;/ref&gt;   Without the competition of television, periodicals inundated with comics became one of the major sources of entertainment particularly for the younger generation.&lt;ref&gt;Lent, ''Asian Comics'', 177.&lt;/ref&gt;   However, following the 1962 coup by the socialist, military leader [[Ne Win]], Burma's comic art with its fundamental political basis languished under the strictures of the junta.&lt;ref&gt;Seekins, ''Historical Dictionary of Burma'', 136.&lt;/ref&gt;   Comic art stagnated until the 1970s when developments in the book publishing industry helped to revive the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Myo Thant, “Social Critics”; Tin Maung Muang Than, “The Media in Myanmar,” in ''Media Fortunes, Changing Times: ASEAN States in Transition'', ed. Russell Hiang-Khng Heng (Pasir Panjang: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2002), 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Temple étrusque 2.jpg|thumb|Detail of the Villa Giulia temple reconstruction]]

'''Etruscan architecture''' was created between about 700 BC and 200 BC, when the expanding civilization of [[ancient Rome]] finally absorbed [[Etruscan civilization]]. The Etruscans were considerable builders in stone, wood and other materials of temples, houses, tombs and city walls, as well as bridges and roads. The only structures remaining in quantity in anything like their original condition are tombs and walls, but through archaeology and other sources we have a good deal of information on what once existed.

From about 630 BC, Etruscan architecture was heavily influenced by [[Greek architecture]], which was itself developing through the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 34; see Izzet, 20–21 for a discussion of Etruscan cultural importing in general&lt;/ref&gt;  In turn it influenced [[Roman architecture]], which in its early centuries can be considered as just a regional variation of Etruscan architecture.  But increasingly, from about 200 BC, the Romans looked directly to Greece for their styling, while sometimes retaining Etruscan shapes and purposes in their buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 220, 255&lt;/ref&gt;

The main monumental forms of Etruscan architecture, listed in decreasing order of the surviving remains, were: the houses of the wealthy elite, the mysterious "monumental complexes", temples, city walls, and rock-cut tombs.  Apart from the podia of temples and some house foundations, only the walls and rock-cut tombs were mainly in stone, and have therefore often largely survived.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temples==
The early Etruscans seem to have worshipped in open air enclosures, marked off but not built over; sacrifices continued to be performed outside rather than inside temples in traditional [[Roman religion]] until its end. It was only around 600 BC, at the height of their civilization, that they began to create monumental temples, undoubtedly influenced by the Greeks&lt;ref&gt;Taylor&lt;/ref&gt;  That these buildings developed essentially from the largest types of Etruscan house has been both asserted and challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Izzet, 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, only the [[podium]] or base platform used stone, with the upper parts of wood and mud-brick, greatly reducing what survives for archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 48; Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is evidence for the portico columns sometimes using stone, as at [[Veii]].&lt;ref&gt;Banti, 31–32; Boethius, 59&lt;/ref&gt;  This has left much about Etruscan temples uncertain. The only written account of significance on their architecture is by [[Vitruvius]] (died after 15 BC), writing some two centuries after the Etruscan civilization was absorbed by Rome. He describes how to plan a "Tuscan temple" that appears to be a Roman "Etruscan-style" ("tuscanicae dispositiones") temple of a type perhaps still sometimes built in his own day, rather than a really historically-minded attempt to describe original Etruscan buildings, though he may well have seen examples of these.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani; Boethius, 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

Many aspects of his description fit what archaeologists can demonstrate, but others do not. It is in any case clear that Etruscan temples could take a number of forms, and also varied over the 400-year period during which they were being made.&lt;ref&gt;Banti, 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless Vitruvius remains the inevitable starting point for a description, and a contrast of Etruscan temples with their [[Greek temple|Greek]] and [[Roman temple|Roman]] equivalents.  There are also a few model temples in pottery, and depictions on tombs or vases.  Remains of the architectural terracotta elements sometimes survive in considerable quantities, and museums, mostly in Italy, have good collections of attractively shaped and painted [[antefix]]es in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Banti, 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitruvius specifies three doors and three [[cella]]e, one for each of the main Etruscan deities, but archaeological remains do not suggest this was normal, though it is found.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;  Roman sources were in the habit of ascribing to the Etruscans a taste for triads in things such as city planning (with three gates to cities, for example), in ways that do not seem to reflect reality.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 35&lt;/ref&gt;  The orientation of the temple is not consistent, and may have been determined by a priest watching the flight of birds at the time of foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Museo archeologico di Firenze, frontone di Talamone 1.JPG|thumb|left|380px|Late terracotta pediment (part-reconstructed) from [[Talamone]]]]
The exteriors of both Greek and Roman temples were originally highly decorated and colourful, especially in the [[entablature]] and roofs, and this was if anything even more true of Etruscan temples. When wood was used for columns, the bases and capitals were often encased in painted terracotta.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 59&lt;/ref&gt; All the edges of the roof were decorated, mostly in brightly painted terracotta, and there seem often to have been a row of sculptures along the central ridge of the roof, going beyond the [[acroterion]] group above a [[pediment]] in Greek and Roman temples. The [[Apollo of Veii]] was part of an acroterion group.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 59–63; Boardman, 255&lt;/ref&gt;  Substantial but broken remains of late sculptured pediment groups survive in museums, in fact rather more than from Greek or Roman temples, partly because the terracotta was not capable of "recycling" as [[marble]] was.  The groups from [[Luna (Etruria)|Luni]] and [[Talamone]] (both now in [[Florence]]) are among the most impressive.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani; Banti, 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Features shared by typical Etruscan and Roman temples, and contrasting with Greek ones, begin with a strongly frontal approach, with great emphasis on the front facade, less on the sides, and very little on the back. The podia are also usually higher, and can only be entered at a section of the front, just presenting a blank platform wall elsewhere.  There may only be columns at the front portico.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;  In Etruscan temples, more than Roman ones, the portico is deep, often representing, as Vitruvius recommends, half of the area under the roof, with multiple rows of columns.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;

At least in later temples, versions of Greek [[Aeolic order|Aeolic]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]] and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capitals are found, as well as the main [[Tuscan order]], a simpler version of the [[Doric order|Doric]], but the attention to the full Greek detailing in the entablature that the Romans pursued seems to have been lacking.  Fluted Tuscan/Doric columns can also be found, against Greek and later Roman conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 49–54&lt;/ref&gt;

Etruscan architecture shared with [[Ancient Egyptian architecture]] the use of large [[cavetto]] mouldings as a [[cornice]], though not on the same massive scale.  The cavetto took the place of the Greek [[cymatium]] in many temples, often painted with vertical "tongue" patterns (as in the reconstructed Etruscan temple at [[Villa Giulia]], illustrated above), and combined with the distinctive "Etruscan round moulding", often painted with scales.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, 61-67; [[:File:Villa Giulia ricostruzione del tempio etrusco 01.JPG|Another view of the reconstructed Etruscan temple]] at [[Villa Giulia]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus===
[[File:TempleofCapitoliumRome.jpg|thumb|Speculative model of the first [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] in Rome]]
The first building of the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]] was the oldest large temple in Rome, dedicated to the [[Capitoline Triad]] consisting of Jupiter and his companion deities, [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]], and had a cathedral-like position in the official religion of Rome. Its first version was traditionally dedicated in 509 BC,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.8&lt;/ref&gt; but in 83 BC it was destroyed by fire, and the rebuilt Greek-style temple completed in 69 BC (there were to be two more fires and new buildings).  For the first temple Etruscan specialists were brought in for various aspects of the building, including making and painting the extensive terracotta elements of the [[entablature]] or upper parts, such as [[antefix]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Stamper, 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;  But for the second building they were summoned from Greece.

The first version is the largest Etruscan temple recorded,&lt;ref&gt;Christofani; Boethius, 47&lt;/ref&gt; and much larger than other Roman temples for centuries after.  However, its size remains heavily disputed by specialists; based on an ancient visitor it has been claimed to have been almost {{convert|60|×|60|m|abbr=on}}, not far short of the largest Greek temples.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;  Whatever its size, its influence on other early Roman temples was significant and long-lasting.&lt;ref&gt;Stamper, 33 and all Chapters 1 and 2.  Stamper is a leading protagonist of a smaller size, rejecting the larger size proposed by the late [[Einar Gjerstad]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Reconstructions usually show very wide eaves, and a wide colonnade stretching down the sides, though not round the back wall as it would have done in a Greek temple.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;  A crude image on a coin of 78 BC shows only four columns, and a very busy roofline.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Tempel Jupiter Optimus.JPG|Denarius of 78 BC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monumental complexes==
[[File:Terracotta architectural details Acquarossa.jpg|thumb|Frieze from [[Acquarossa, Italy|Acquarossa]] (Zone F)]]
"Monumental complex" or building is a term used for a few large sets of buildings relatively recently uncovered by archaeology, the term reflecting a lack of certainty over their function. The two leading examples are "[[Poggio Civitate#The large Archaic building|the Archaic building]]" at [[Poggio Civitate]] and another at [[Acquarossa, Italy|Acquarossa]] (Zone F); both are 6th-century or earlier.  Both have sets of buildings round a courtyard, which use stone, at least in the foundations, roof tiles, and elaborate decorations in architectural terracotta.  Their size is exceptional for their early date. One obvious possible function is as palatial dwellings; another is as civic buildings, acting as places for assembly, and commemoration of aspects of the community.  Only the stone foundations and ceramic fragments remain for excavations to discover.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 2–6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Houses==
It seems clear from the richer tombs that the Etruscan elite lived in fairly spacious comfort, but there is little evidence as to what their homes looked like, although some furniture is shown in tomb frescos.  The rock-cut tomb chambers often form suites of "rooms", some quite large, which presumably resemble in part the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] homes of the better-off Etruscans.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 75–89; Banti, 27–28; Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;   Unlike several of the necropoli, Etruscan cities have generally been built over from the Romans onwards, and houses have left little trace. Where remains survive, there are tightly-packed tufa bases, with perhaps mud-brick above, but in some places the lower parts of tufa walls survive even in small houses.  One complete set of foundations shows a house 7.9m by 3.9m (25 x 13 feet).&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 75–77&lt;/ref&gt;  At large farms, mines, quarries and perhaps other sites employing many people (many or mostly slaves), workers lived in dormitories.
[[File:Maquettes of houses from c 1000 BC.jpg|thumb|left|Selection of hut urns]]

A form of models of houses in pottery, and sometimes bronze, called "hut urns" gives us some indications.  These were apparently used to hold cremated ashes, and are found in the preceding [[Villanovan culture]] and early Etruscan burials, especially in northern areas.&lt;ref&gt;Banti, 25; Boethius, 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;  The hut urns show a conventional model with a single interior space.  They are usually round or slightly oval, often with prominent wooden beams laid in two rows on the sloping roof, which cross at the central ridge and project some way in "V"s into the air; these projections seem to have been sometimes carved or otherwise decorated.  The urns always have a large square-ish door for access, sometimes two, and the outline of windows in the walls may be indicated by ridges or marks in the clay.  There is very often a window and exit for smoke, above the door in the roof, and at the opposite end.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Such houses were made of earth and organic materials, using mud brick and [[daub and wattle]].&lt;ref&gt;Banti, 25&lt;/ref&gt;  Stone [[hearth]]s and perhaps stone rings at the base are found.  Even the well-off seem rarely to have lived in stone houses, and rock-cut tomb chambers often represent wooden ceilings in stone.  The "Tomb of the Reliefs" at Banditaccia suggests that possessions such as tools and weapons were often hung from the walls for storage.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Palatine Hill]] in Rome, the [[Casa Romuli]] ("House of [[Romulus]]") was long preserved, and when necessary rebuilt as before.  It was a hut made of wood posts and roof beams, [[wattle and daub]] walls and a [[thatch]]ed roof,&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 74&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly typical of ordinary Etruscan housing outside crowded city centres.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;  The site cannot be identified with certainty, but at one candidate location circle of six [[post-hole]]s plus a central one have been found, cut into the tufa bedrock, with an ovoid 4.9m x 3.6m perimeter.

==Tombs and tumuli==
[[File:Banditaccia Tomba Dei Capitelli.jpg|thumb|[[Banditaccia]] necropolis, Tomb of the Capitelli]]
Rich Etruscans left elaborate tombs, mostly gathered in large [[necropoli]] some way outside their cities.  These were generously filled with [[grave goods]],&lt;ref&gt;Banti, 20–21, 26, 28&lt;/ref&gt;  especially ceramics, which give us most of our understanding of Etruscan culture.&lt;ref&gt;Izzet, 16&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, in the tufa regions of southern Etruria, the burial chamber was cut from solid rock below ground, which is relatively easy with this rock, but there was a structure above, often rather large. In other regions they are normally built up above ground.&lt;ref&gt;Banti, 21&lt;/ref&gt;  They were reused for further burials in the same family over several generations, and would often have become very crowded with sarchophagi and grave-goods, though the known survivals have now been emptied, either by looters or archaeologists.

Some tombs are stone buildings, often in rows, rather like small houses. Others are round [[tumuli]] with stone retaining walls, with steps down to rock-cut chambers below. Both types are found closely packed together in necropoli like [[Banditaccia]] and [[Monterozzi necropolis|Monterozzi]], the latter containing some 6,000 burials. Several different types of tombs have been identified, reflecting a development through time as well as differences in income.  Some types clearly replicate aspects of the richer houses, with a number of connected chambers, columns with capitals, and rock-cut ceilings given beams.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani; Izzet, 16–17, cautions against transferring such details automatically&lt;/ref&gt;  Many tombs had [[fresco]] paintings, which does not seem to have been a Greek influence (though the style of the paintings are certainly based on Greek art), as the Greeks had ceased to use [[chamber tomb]]s well before the Etruscans started to paint theirs in about 600; the Egyptians had also ceased painting tombs by then.&lt;ref&gt;Banti, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Walls and fortifications==
[[File:Orbetello12.jpg|thumb|Wall at Orbetello]]
Etruscan cities, which often sat on hill-tops, became walled from about the 8th century, first in mud-brick, then often in stone.  Even before the Romans began to swallow up Etruscan territory, Italy had frequent wars, and by the later period had [[Celts|Celtic]] enemies to the north, and an expanding Rome to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; There was an [[Agger (ancient Rome)|agger]] or rampart and a ''fossa'' or ditch in front of the wall.  The towns had a number of gates where roads entered, which were sometimes given arched gateways.  The best survivor of these is the 2nd-century Porta Marzia at [[Perugia]] (illustrated above) from the end of the period. Here, as in many cases, surviving work comes from the period just around the Roman takeover, but appears to represent Etruscan traditions.  By the 4th century, [[Volterra]] had two walls, the second enclosing the whole city.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani; Boethius, 66–68&lt;/ref&gt;

The stonework is often of fine quality, sometimes using regular rectangular blocks in a rough [[ashlar]], and sometimes "cyclopeian", using large polygonal blocks, partly shaped to fit each other, somewhat in the manner of the well-known [[Inca architecture|Inca masonry]], though not reaching that level of quality.  Gaps are left, which are filled in with much smaller stones.&lt;ref&gt;Boëthius et al, 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Polygonal masonry wall of Rusellae.JPG|Polygonal masonry wall at [[Rusellae]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Road network==
[[File:Una via cava.JPG|thumb|240px|Sunken road or [[via cava]]]]
Several important and unimportant [[Roman road]]s, such as the [[Via Cassia]], overlie Etruscan precursors, but there are sufficient Etruscan sites that were neglected after their conquest to allow an understanding of the considerable Etruscan road system. Roads did not just run between cities, but out into the countryside to allow agricultural produce to be easily brought in.&lt;ref&gt;Izzet, 193–195&lt;/ref&gt;  While not as heavily engineered as Roman roads, considerable efforts went into creating a road surface that on major routes could be as wide as 10.4 metres, on a 12 kilometre stretch connecting [[Cerveteri]] with its port [[Pyrgi]], made in the 5th century.  This had a gravel surface, between tufo edging-blocks, and a central drainage channel.&lt;ref&gt;Izzet, 193&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vie Cave]], narrow cuttings often running deeply through hills, are probably little changed since Etruscan times.  As well as connecting sites, these may have had a defensive function in times of war.  Their construction may have mainly resulted from the wearing through soft tufo bedrock by iron-rimmed wheels, creating deep ruts that required the road to be frequently recut to a smooth surface.  Their dating can only be deduced by that of settlements they pass between, and objects from tombs beside them.&lt;ref&gt;Izzet, 193&lt;/ref&gt;  The 7th and 6th centuries show a move to replace earlier tracks only suitable for mules and pedestrians with wider and more engineered roads capable of taking wheeled vehicles, using gentler but longer routes through hilly country.&lt;ref&gt;Izzet, 194&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridges were common, though fords more so where these would suffice.  Presumably many were in timber, but some at least used stone underneath a timber roadway.&lt;ref&gt;Izzet, 195&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9097">'''FedEx furniture''' is the artistic creation of computer programmer and [[creative consumer]] Jose Avila, III.  In June, 2005, Avila created a website, Fedexfurniture.com,  to display photographs of a couch, bed, dining room table, and desk that he had constructed out of cartons obtained from overnight shipping giant [[FedEx Corporation]] (FedEx). FedEx attorneys used the [[Notice and take down|takedown]] provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) to force Avila's [[Internet service provider|ISP]] to take the site offline, accusing Avila of infringing on FedEx's [[copyright]]s and [[trademark]]s, breaching his [[contract]] with FedEx by using the cartons for purposes other than shipping, and potentially misleading consumers into believing that FedEx approved or endorsed Avila's actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berthon|first=Pierre R.|last2=Pitt|first2=Leyland F.|last3=McCarthy|first3=Ian|last4=Kates|first4=Steven M.|date=2007-01-01|title=When customers get clever: Managerial approaches to dealing with creative consumers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681306000796|journal=Business Horizons|volume=50|issue=1|pages=39–47|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2006.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berthon|first=Pierre|last2=Pitt|first2=Leyland|last3=Kietzmann|first3=Jan|last4=McCarthy|first4=Ian P.|date=2015-08-01|title=CGIP: Managing Consumer-Generated Intellectual Property|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1525/cmr.2015.57.4.43|journal=California Management Review|language=en|volume=57|issue=4|pages=43–62|doi=10.1525/cmr.2015.57.4.43|issn=0008-1256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among attorneys and activist organizations concerned with the exercise of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights on the [[Internet]], FedEx's actions raised questions about the [[constitutionality]] of using the DMCA to [[censorship|censor]] unwanted speech.  The Fedexfurniture.com website is down as of July 8th, 2017.

==The story==

In 2005, Avila moved to Tempe, Arizona with nothing more than clothes and work essentials.  He was still stuck in a lease on his California apartment, and could barely afford his new apartment in Arizona.

After a bit of frustration over not having furniture, Avila remembered that a former roommate had solved a similar problem by constructing furniture using FedEx cartons.  Using hundreds of FedEx boxes and materials that he "already had lying around" for shipping various items, Avila constructed every piece of furniture in his apartment. Avila's designs were sturdy and attractive. Friends urged Avila to put pictures of the furniture on a Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berthon|first=Pierre|last2=Pitt|first2=Leyland|last3=Kietzmann|first3=Jan|last4=McCarthy|first4=Ian P.|date=2015-08-01|title=CGIP: Managing Consumer-Generated Intellectual Property|url=https://doi.org/10.1525/cmr.2015.57.4.43|journal=California Management Review|language=en|volume=57|issue=4|pages=43–62|doi=10.1525/cmr.2015.57.4.43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berthon|first=Pierre R.|last2=Pitt|first2=Leyland F.|last3=McCarthy|first3=Ian|last4=Kates|first4=Steven M.|date=2007-01-01|title=When customers get clever: Managerial approaches to dealing with creative consumers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681306000796|journal=Business Horizons|volume=50|issue=1|pages=39–47|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2006.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Avila, he did so in order to show that trying financial circumstances need not lead to despair; one can respond creatively, even artistically, by using "found" materials.{{ref|ffstory}} The site's message was "It's OK to be ghetto".{{ref|counterthink}}

The site subsequently attracted widespread attention, both from Web surfers and the press.  Because the site was getting so much traffic, Avila placed a PayPal donation link on the page and asked for help to pay for the bandwidth charges. He also announced a plan to sell Fedexfurniture.com T-shirts, although Avila says that no T-shirts were ever sold.{{ref|ffstory}}

On June 27, 2005, FedEx attorneys wrote to Avila's [[Internet service provider|ISP]]. Citing the takedown provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), they demanded that the ISP remove Avila's materials from the Web.{{ref|takedownnotice}} They justified their request on two grounds:
*Infringement of FedEx's [[intellectual property]] (specifically, [[copyright]]s and [[trademark]]s.)
*Violation of FedEx's [[terms of use]] for packaging supplies.

In order to take advantage of the [[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] provisions of the DMCA, Avila's ISP complied with the request and removed Avila's materials from the Web. Had the ISP not done so, it could have been held liable for [[contributory copyright infringement|contributory infringement]] (aiding and abetting the infringer) if Avila's materials were subsequently found to be infringing in a court of law.

FedEx's actions concerned Internet free speech activist organizations, such as [[Stanford University|Stanford University's]] [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society|Center for Internet and Society]],  which are concerned about the use of the DMCA's takedown provisions to [[censorship|censor]] unwanted speech.  According to these organizations, the DMCA's purpose is to prevent Internet copyright infringement; it was never Congress's intent that the DMCA's takedown provisions should be used when the real issue is [[trademark infringement]] or [[breach of contract]].{{ref|fairuse}}

A Stanford attorney, [[Jennifer Granick]], assisted Avila on a [[pro bono]] basis. In her letter to FedEx, she disputed the use of the DMCA to remove Avila's site from the Web; she argued that the company's claim of [[copyright infringement]] had no merit; therefore, FedEx should not have used the DMCA to silence Avila's speech. The company's underlying motivations, she argued, were to protect its [[trademark]] and ability to place restrictions on public use of its cartons.{{ref|stanford}} Avila restored his site briefly. The dispute attracted widespread press attention, and Avila was frequently interviewed to tell his side of the story. In response to Granick's letter, FedEx attorneys reiterated their claims. Subsequently, Avila removed his site from the Web, citing technical difficulties.  By January 2006, Avila's site had returned, however, by June 30, 2006 the site had again disappeared. This was caused by a server crash, and as of July 27, 2006 it was back online, but as of August 16, 2007 the site is gone.  It popped up again in October 2007, but is currently down (July 8, 2017).

'''''Fiction Weekly''''' was an [[United States|American]] [[literary magazine]] based in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]].  ''Fiction Weekly'' was conceived in the summer of 2008 by members of the [[McNeese State University]] [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA Program]] in [[creative writing]].  As its name suggests, ''Fiction Weekly'' publishes on a weekly basis; it is published exclusively on the internet and features one previously unpublished piece of [[fiction]] on its front page each week.

Authors published in ''Fiction Weekly'' have appeared in [[anthologies]] such as [[New Stories From the South]], have been nominated for the [[Pushcart Prize]], and have been published in many other well reputed literary magazines including, [[Glimmer Train]], [[The Pinch]], and [[Harpur Palate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://michelle-reed.name/5.html Reed, Michelle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fictionweekly.com/theonionwasme.htm Fiction Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as of May 2010, the website had not been updated for six months. It was stated that the magazine ceased publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What it was|url=http://www.fictionweekly.com/|work=Fiction Weekly|accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
During a pro hockey [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]], Doug "The Thug" Glatt's ([[Seann William Scott]]) team, the Halifax Highlanders, has to contend with an influx of new players. With pro hockey suspended, media focus has descended on the lower league, and the owner of the Highlanders, Hyrum Cain ([[Callum Keith Rennie]]), seeks to capitalize on the attention. Before the opening game, Doug is made captain and leads his team out onto the ice. In a close fought game, Doug is goaded into a fight with the rival team's enforcer, Anders Cain ([[Wyatt Russell]]), an up-and-coming player with a violent streak, and the son of the Highlanders' owner. Anders wins the fight, and with Doug badly injured, the Highlanders lose the game. Dealing with rehab, Doug decides to retire and accept a more stable job as an insurance salesman. At home, Doug's wife Eva realizes that she is pregnant, and she and Doug make preparations for their new child. Without Doug, the Highlanders go on a long losing streak, prompting the owner to push for changes. He signs several overseas players and pushes to add his own son to the team. Hyrum foresees Anders as the new captain of the Highlanders, and although the coach disagrees with the move, anticipating locker room dysfunction, Hyrum strongarms him into making Anders the new captain. 

Meanwhile, Doug finds no joy in his new job, stuck in a dingy office, and he begins secretly training to get back into hockey. Doug visits his old rival, Ross "The Boss" Rhea, who has left hockey and now competes in a hockey fighting league, where he is the current champion. Doug convinces Ross to train him in southpaw fighting, as the injury he suffered fighting Anders has weakened his right arm. Ross agrees to train him, and Doug slowly begins to learn how to fight left-handed. Ross convinces Doug that if he joins the hockey fighting league and impresses, it could be a way to get back into minor league hockey. Doug takes Ross' advice, but the first fight ends up being a battle royale style brawl, instead of the one-on-one fights that Doug had witnessed before. Doug and Ross end up as the last two standing during the melee, but Ross is too hurt to continue and collapses before they can fight each other. In the locker room after the fight, Ross reveals that he has [[post-concussion syndrome]], and doctors have recommended that he stop playing, as one more bad hit could cause a permanent injury.

At the same time, the Highlanders have improved with Anders as the captain, but not enough to get into playoff position. Anders' self-sabotaging play, in which he constantly is being penalized for fighting, has kept the Highlanders outside of a playoff spot. In addition, Anders' aggressive and violent attitudes towards his fellow players keeps the whole team on edge, and their play suffers as a result. During another losing effort, Anders grows frustrated and ends up knocking out the entire opposing team. He is promptly suspended, and the coach demands a change. Hyrum, having seen Doug at the hockey fighting league, suggests that they add Doug back to the roster, secretly hoping that his addition will push his son to play better. Before Doug's first game back, Eva makes Doug promise that he won't fight, concerned for him now that they're about to be parents. Doug reluctantly agrees, and the Highlanders narrowly win in Doug's celebrated return. The Highlanders go on a winning streak, but when Anders returns from suspension, he goads Doug into being more aggressive. Doug and Anders interrupt a game during a dispute, and they are both suspended for the next game. During the game's afterparty, Anders provokes Doug into a fight, and when Eva sees that Doug has been fighting again, she kicks him out of the house.

Meanwhile, the Highlanders must win the last two games of the season to sneak into the playoffs. With Anders and Doug suspended, Hyrum decides to sign Ross, who has still been competing in the local hockey fighting league. To free up a spot, Hyrum terminates Anders' contract, fed up with his son's antics. While Ross helps the Highlanders to win the first of their last two games, Eva goes into labor, and Doug reconciles with her as they head to the hospital. After having her baby, Eva realizes that the same drive that led Doug to be with her during the birth, is the same drive that pushes him to want to defend his teammates on the ice, and she gives Doug her blessing to continue fighting. Having been kicked off the team, Anders rejoins his old team, as they will play the Highlanders in the last game of the season with a playoff spot on the line. The game is immediately chippy, with both Ross and Anders starting fights. As the game enters the third period with the game tied, Ross and Anders are involved in a scuffle, and Anders cheap shots Ross, checking him from behind into the boards. Ross is knocked unconscious, and while paramedics take him away on a stretcher, Doug enters the rink to fight Anders in retaliation.

Doug uses his southpaw training to beat Anders, but when Doug shows mercy, Anders threatens Doug, claiming that he will never stop coming for him until they are both like Ross, being carried out on stretchers. Realizing that his new family is more important to him than hockey, Doug uses his weakened right arm to level Anders, but throws his arm out and has to be helped off the ice. Hyrum rushes to his son's aid, where Anders tells him that he hates hockey, and the two appear to mend things between them. Having been told earlier that further injury to his right arm would be career-ending, Doug realizes that his hockey days are behind him. He watches as the Highlanders win the game in the final seconds, and during the celebration, he sets his stick down and goes home.

==Reception==
On review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 44%, based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Seann William Scott remains as watchable as ever in the title role, but ''Goon: Last of the Enforcers'' repeats its predecessor's violent and profane formula to diminishing effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/goon_last_of_the_enforcers/|title=Goon: Last of the Enforcers (2017)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 50 out of 100, based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/goon-last-of-the-enforcers|title=Goon: Last of the Enforcers reviews|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Hertz from ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' gave the film 3 out of 4 and wrote "Baruchel's sequel is everything Dowse's original film was, amped up a degree or three: The fights involving dim-bulb hero Doug (Seann William Scott) and his various rivals are bloodier, the locker-room talk is dirtier and the on-ice action is slicker. The unlikely project – how many made-in-Canada films spark a franchise? – doesn't quite reach the heights of the original film, which found surprising pathos in Doug's tale of sweet good guy to brutal goon. But it delivers on nearly every other scale, including standout performances from returning players Scott, Alison Pill and Liev Schreiber, as well as some bits of comic gold courtesy of series rookies Wyatt Russell, T.J. Miller and Jason Jones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hertz|first1=Barry|title=Goon: Last of the Enforcers is a welcome addition to a Canadian hockey franchise|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/film-reviews/goon-last-of-the-enforcers-is-a-welcome-addition-to-a-canadian-hockey-franchise/article34325771/|accessdate=August 12, 2017|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' gave the film 3.5 out of 5, and stated "Violent, crude and really funny, ''Goon: Last of The Enforcers'', works for the same reason the original Goon worked — you will love the characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Braun|first1=Liz|title='Goon: Last of the Enforcers' review: Violent, crude and funny|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2017/03/16/goon-last-of-the-enforcers-review-violent-crude-and-funny|accessdate=August 12, 2017|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=March 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[National Post]]'' gave the film a 1 out of 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marsh|first1=Calum|title=Gross misconduct: The unfunny Goon sequel is everything its predecessor managed not to be|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/movies/gross-misconduct-the-unfunny-goon-sequel-is-everything-its-predecessor-managed-not-to-be|accessdate=May 11, 2017|work=[[National Post]]|date=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Historical documents''' are original [[document]]s that contain important historical information about a person, place, or event and can thus serve as [[primary sources]] as important ingredients of the [[historical method]]ology.

Significant historical documents can be [[deed]]s, laws, accounts of battles (often given by the victors or persons sharing their viewpoint), or the exploits of the powerful. Though these documents are of historical interest, they do not detail the daily lives of ordinary people, or the way society functioned. [[Anthropologist]]s, [[historians]] and [[archeologists]] generally are more interested in documents that describe the [[everyday life|day-to-day lives]] of ordinary people, indicating what they ate, their interaction with other members of their households and social groups, and their states of mind. It is this [[information]] that allows them to try to understand and describe the way society was functioning at any particular time in [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prattlibrary.org/research/tools/index.aspx?cat=19963&amp;id=83744|title=Exploring Daily Life throughout History: How Did They Live?|publisher=[[Enoch Pratt Free Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek [[ostraka]] provide good examples of historical documents from "among the [[common people]]".

Many documents that are produced today, such as personal letters, pictures, contracts, newspapers, and medical records, would be considered valuable historical documents in the [[future]]. However most of these will be lost in the future since they are either printed on ordinary paper which has a limited lifespan, or even stored in [[Digital data|digital]] formats, then lost track over time.

Some companies and government entities are attempting to increase the number of documents that will survive the passage of time, by taking into account the preservation issues, and either printing documents in a manner that would increase the likelihood of them surviving indefinitely, or placing selected documents in [[time capsule]]s or other special [[information storage|storage]] environments.

'''Inconnu Art Group''' (later the '''Inconnu Independent Art Group''') is the name of a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] group of maverick [[fine art]]ists from the [[communism|communist]] and postcommunist eras. The original members were Bokros Péter, Molnár Tamás, Csécsei Mihály, Mészáros Bánk, Letenyei József, Sipos Mihály, Kopács Kovács Miklós, and Morva Ibolya. The foundation date of the group is unknown, but as Péter Bokros remembers (in 2005), they started their common activities in 1978, [[Cegléd]], but the name "inconnu" came later.

They  took part in (often illegal) exhibitions and performances in the eighties; and were considered as an important part of the Hungarian democratic opposition both in Hungary and in abroad. From 1979 they were subject to serious manhunt by the Hungarian authorities, and they were continuously followed and eyed by secret agents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galantai.hu/festo/1982/820614.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Post-Communism==
After 1994 some members became active again and continued &amp;ndash; in their words &amp;ndash; their "[[anticommunism|anti-communist]]" drive, now against the (post-communist socialist) governments (led by Hungarian Socialist Party, MSzP).{{fact|date=January 2014}} Other members created independent art and to explore the "rubberized horror of global powers".{{fact|date=January 2014}}

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Indigenous intellectual property''' is an umbrella legal term used in national and international forums to identify [[indigenous peoples]]' claims of [[intellectual property]] rights to protect specific cultural knowledge of their groups.&lt;ref&gt;RAINFOREST ABORIGINAL NETWORK (1993) &lt;u&gt;''Julayinbul: Aboriginal Intellectual and Cultural Property Definitions, Ownership and Strategies for Protection.''&lt;/u&gt; Rainforest Aboriginal Network. Cairns. Page 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNDRIPart31"&gt;Working Group on Indigenous Populations, accepted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], ''[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626112013/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement |date=26 June 2015 }}''; UN Headquarters; New York City (13 September 2007): Article 31: "Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions."&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a concept that has developed out of predominantly [[Western culture|western]] concepts of intellectual property law, and has most recently been promoted by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], as part of a more general [[United Nations]] push&lt;ref name="OHCRC001"&gt;{{cite web | last = OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS | first =  | year = 2007 | url = http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/indigenous/ | title = Indigenous peoples | format = WEB PAGE | work =  | publisher = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights.

[[Nation state]]s across the world have experienced difficulties reconciling local indigenous  laws and cultural norms with a predominantly western legal system, in many cases leaving indigenous peoples' individual and [[community|communal]] intellectual property rights largely unprotected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hadley | first = Marie | title = Lack of Political Will or Academic Inertia? - The need for non-legal responses to the issue of Indigenous art and copyright | journal = Alternative Law Journal | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 152–156 | publisher = Legal Service Bulletin Co-operative Ltd | location = Melbourne | year = 2009 | url = http://www.altlj.org/index.php?option=Articles&amp;task=viewarticle&amp;artid=69#2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, international bodies such as the [[United Nations]] have become involved in the issue,&lt;ref name="UNDRIPart31"/&gt; making more specific declarations that intellectual property also includes cultural property such as historical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies, and performing arts in addition to artwork and literature.&lt;ref name="UNDRIPart11"&gt;Working Group on Indigenous Populations, accepted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], ''[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626112013/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement |date=26 June 2015 }}''; UN Headquarters; New York City (13 September 2007): Article 11: "Indigenous peoples have the right to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs. This includes the right to maintain, '''protect''' and develop the past, present and future manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and historical sites, artefacts, designs, '''ceremonies''', technologies and visual and performing arts and literature."[bold added]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Declarations regarding Indigenous Intellectual Property ==
While a number of [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] communities have issued tribal declarations over the past 35 years, in the lead up to and during the United Nations International Year for the World's Indigenous Peoples (1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WATSON, Irene |title=1993: International Year for Indigenous Peoples |publisher=AustLII |year=1992 |work=&lt;u&gt;Aboriginal Law Bulletin&lt;/u&gt; |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AboriginalLB/1992/52.html |accessdate=2007-11-29 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; then during the following United Nations Decade of the World's Indigenous Peoples (1995–2004)&lt;ref name="OHCRC001"/&gt; a number of conferences of both indigenous and non-indigenous specialists were held in different parts of the world, resulting in a number of unified declarations and statements identifying, explaining, refining, and defining 'indigenous intellectual property'.&lt;ref name="WIPO002"&gt;WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ORGANISATION (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resolution of the 5th Annual Meeting of the Traditional Elders Circle, October, 1980===

Before ceremonies and ceremonial knowledge were affirmed as protected intellectual property by the [[United Nations General Assembly|U.N. General Assembly]],&lt;ref name="UNDRIPart11"/&gt; smaller coalitions of Indigenous cultural leaders met to issue declarations about protection of ceremonial knowledge.&lt;ref name="Rez5"&gt;Yellowtail, Tom, ''et al''; "[http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/history/elders.html Resolution of the 5th Annual Meeting of the Traditional Elders Circle]" Northern Cheyenne Nation, Two Moons' Camp, Rosebud Creek, Montana; 5 October 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"&gt;Mesteth, Wilmer, et al (10 June 1993) "[http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/ladecwar.htm Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality]." "At the Lakota Summit V, an international gathering of US and Canadian Lakota, Dakota and Nakota Nations, about 500 representatives from 40 different tribes and bands of the Lakota unanimously passed a "Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality." The following declaration was unanimously passed."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"&gt;Taliman, Valerie (1993) "[http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/warlakot.htm Article On The 'Lakota Declaration of War']."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In 1980, spiritual leaders of the [[Cheyenne people|Northern Cheyenne]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], [[Hopi people|Hopi]], [[Muscogee people|Muskogee]], [[Ojibwe people|Chippewa]]-[[Cree]], [[Iroquois|Haudenosaunee]] and [[Lakota people|Lakota]] Nations met on the [[Northern Cheyenne Reservation]] in [[Montana]],&lt;ref name="Rez5"/&gt; and issued a resolution that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''These [non-Native] individuals are gathering non-Indian people as followers who believe they are receiving instructions of the original people. We, the Elders and our representatives sitting in Council, give warning to these non-Indian followers that it is our understanding this is not a proper process, that the authority to carry these sacred objects is given by the people...''&lt;ref name="Rez5"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Declaration of Belem, July 1988===

The first international congress of the International Society of Ethnobiology involving [[anthropology|anthropologists]], [[biology|biologists]], [[chemistry|chemists]], [[sociology|sociologists]], and indigenous peoples met at [[Belém|Belem]], [[Brazil]]. They identified themselves collectively as '[[Ethnobiology|ethnobiologists]]', and announced that (amongst other matters) since "Indigenous cultures around the world are being disrupted and destroyed.":
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Mechanisms [ought to] be established by which indigenous specialists are recognized as proper Authorities and are consulted in all programs affecting them, their resources and their environment"''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Procedures must be developed to compensate native peoples for the utilization of their knowledge and their biological resources"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Declaration of Belem|publisher=|year=1988|format=PDF|work=|url=http://ise.arts.ubc.ca/_common/docs/DeclarationofBelem.pdf|accessdate=2007-12-04}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Kari-Oca Declaration and Indigenous Peoples Earth Charter, May 1992 ===

The Kari-Oca Declaration and [[charter]] was first affirmed in [[Brazil]] in May 1992, and then re-affirmed in [[Indonesia]], in June 2002. Ratifying the document were Indigenous peoples from the Americas, Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe and the Pacific who, at Kari-Oca Villages, united in one voice to collectively express their serious concern at the way the world was exploiting the natural resources upon which indigenous peoples depend.

Specific reference is made within the Indigenous Peoples Earth Charter to perceived abuses of indigenous people's intellectual and cultural properties.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henrietta Marrie|FOURMILE, Henrietta]] (1996) "Making things work: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Involvement in Bioregional Planning" in ''Approaches to bioregional planning. Part 2. Background Papers to the conference; 30 October – 1 November 1995, Melbourne''; Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. Canberra. p.235&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the heading,"''Culture, Science and Intellectual Property''", amongst other matters, it is asserted:&lt;ref&gt;FOURMILE pages 260–261&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality, June 1993===

At the Lakota Summit V, an international gathering of US and Canadian Lakota, Dakota and Nakota Nations, about 500 representatives from 40 different tribes and bands of the Lakota unanimously passed a "Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality."&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt; Representatives affirmed a zero-tolerance policy on the exploitation of Lakota, Dakota and Nakota ceremonial knowledge.&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Whereas''' ''we are conveners of an ongoing series of comprehensive forums on the abuse and exploitation of Lakota spirituality; and''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Whereas''' ''we represent the recognized Lakota leaders, traditional elders, and grassroots advocates of the Lakota people; and ... ''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Whereas''' ''non-Indian charlatans and "wannabes" are selling books that promote systematic colonization of our Lakota spirituality; and ''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Whereas''' ''this exponential exploitation of our Lakota spiritual traditions requires that we take immediate action to defend our most precious Lakota spirituality from further contamination, desecration and abuse; ...''&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''6.'''  ''We urge traditional people, tribal leaders, and governing councils of all other Indian Nations, as well as all national Indian organizations, to join us in calling for an immediate end to this rampant exploitation of our respective American Indian sacred traditions by issuing statements denouncing such abuse; for it is not the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota people alone whose spiritual practices are being systematically violated by non-Indians.''&lt;br/&gt;
'''7.'''  ''We urge all our Indian brothers and sisters to act decisively and boldly in our present campaign to end the destruction of our sacred traditions, keeping in mind that our highest duty as Indian people: to preserve the purity of our precious traditions for future generations, so that our children and our children's children will survive and prosper in the sacred manner intended for each of our respective peoples by our Creator.''&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mataatua Declaration on Cultural and Intellectual Property Rights of Indigenous Peoples, June, 1993===

On 18 June 1993, 150 delegates from fourteen countries, including indigenous representatives from  Japan ([[Ainu people|Ainu]]), Australia, [[Cook Islands]], [[Fiji]], India, [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Philippines]], [[Surinam]], United States and [[Aotearoa]] (New Zealand) met at Whakatane ([[Bay of Plenty]] region of New Zealand). The assembly '''affirmed''' Indigenous peoples' knowledge is of benefit to all humanity; '''recognised''' Indigenous peoples are willing to offer their knowledge to all humanity provided their fundamental rights to define and control this knowledge is protected by the international community; '''insisted''' the first beneficiaries of Indigenous knowledge must be the direct Indigenous descendants of such knowledge; and '''declared''' all forms of exploitation of Indigenous knowledge must cease.&lt;ref name="FOURMILE page 262"&gt;FOURMILE page 262&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Section 2 of their declaration they specifically ask State, National and International Agencies to:&lt;ref name="FOURMILE page 262"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''2.1''': Recognise that Indigenous peoples are the guardians of their customary knowledge and have the right to protect and control dissemination of that knowledge.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''2.2''': Recognise that Indigenous peoples also have the right to create new knowledge based on cultural tradition"''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''2.3''': Accept that the cultural and intellectual property rights of Indigenous peoples are vested with those who created them.''&lt;ref name="WIPO001"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Julayinbul Statement on Indigenous Intellectual Property Rights, November 1993===
[[File:JulayinbulIP.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Julayinbul Aboriginal Intellectual Property Conference Logo (1993)]]
This declaration arose out of a meeting of Indigenous and non-Indigenous specialists, who, at [[Daintree, Queensland|Jingarrba]], in north-eastern Australia, agreed Indigenous intellectual property rights are best determined from within the [[Custom (law)|customary law]]s of the Indigenous groups' themselves.&lt;ref&gt;FOURMILE page 236&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the declaration, Indigenous customary laws are (re)named 'Aboriginal common laws', and it is insisted these laws must be acknowledged and treated as equal to any other systems of law:&lt;ref&gt;FOURMILE pages 264&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...Indigenous Peoples and Nations reaffirm their right to define for themselves their own intellectual property, acknowledging...the uniqueness of their own particular heritage.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...Indigenous Peoples and Nations...declare that we...are willing to share [our intellectual property] with all humanity provided that our fundamental rights to define and control this property are recognised by the international community...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Aboriginal intellectual property, within Aboriginal Common Law, is an inherent, inalienable right which cannot be terminated, extinguished, or taken... Any use of the intellectual property of Aboriginal Nations and Peoples may only be done in accordance with Aboriginal Common Law, and any unauthorised use is strictly prohibited."&lt;ref name="WIPO001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAINFOREST ABORIGINAL NETWORK Pages 9–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Santa Cruz de la Sierra Statement on Intellectual Property, September, 1994===

A regional meeting was held at [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], [[Bolivia]] where indigenous peoples from the South America's concerned about the way internationally prevailing intellectual property systems and regimes appeared to be favouring the appropriation of indigenous peoples' knowledge and resources for commercial purposes, agreed:&lt;ref name="FOUR02"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''For members of indigenous peoples, knowledge and determination of the use of resources are collective and intergenerational. No...individuals or communities, nor the Government, can sell or transfer ownership of [cultural] resources which are the property of the people and which each generation has an obligation to safeguard for the next.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Work must be conducted on the design of a protection and recognition system which is in accordance with ..our own conception, and mechanisms must be developed .. which will prevent appropriation of our resources and knowledge.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''There must be appropriate mechanisms for maintaining and ensuring the right of Indigenous peoples to deny indiscriminate access to the [cultural] resources of our communities or peoples and making it possible to contest patents or other exclusive rights to what is essentially Indigenous.''&lt;ref name="FOUR02"&gt;FOURMILE 1996: Pages 266–267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Tambunan Statement on the Protection and Conservation of Indigenous Knowledge, February, 1995===

Indigenous people of Asia met at [[Tambunan]], [[Sabah]], East [[Malaysia]], to assert rights of self-determination, and to express concern about, and fear of, the threat unfamiliar 'western' intellectual property rights systems may pose to them.  It was agreed:&lt;ref name="FOUR003"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''For the Indigenous peoples of Asia, the intellectual property rights system is not only a very new concept but it is also very western...[W]ith [western style] intellectual property property rights, alien laws will be devised to exploit the Indigenous knowledge and [cultural] resources of the Indigenous peoples.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The [western] intellectual property rights system and the (mis)appropriation of Indigenous knowledge without the prior knowledge and consent of Indigenous peoples evoke feelings of anger, or being cheated''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Indigenous peoples are not benefiting from the intellectual property rights system.  Indigenous knowledge and [cultural] resources are being eroded, exploited and/or appropriated by outsiders in the likes of transnational corporations, institutions, researchers, and scientists who are after profits and benefits gained..''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"For indigenous peoples, life is a common property which cannot be owned, commercialized, and monopolised...Based on this world view, Indigenous peoples find it difficult to relate [western] intellectual property rights...to their daily lives...''&lt;ref name="FOUR003"&gt;FOURMILE 1996: Pages 268–269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Suva Statement on Indigenous Peoples Knowledge and Intellectual Property Rights, April 1995===

Participants from the independent countries and "nonautonomous colonised territories" of the Pacific region met in [[Suva]], [[Fiji]] to discuss internationally dominant intellectual property rights regimes, and at that meeting they resolved to support the Kari Oca, Mataatua, Julayinbul, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Tambunan initiatives&lt;ref name="FOUR004"/&gt;(above).  In particular participants:&lt;ref name="FOUR004"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Reaffirme[d] that imperialism is perpetuated through [western] intellectual property rights systems...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Declar[ed] Indigenous peoples are willing to share our knowledge with humanity provided we determine when, where and how it is used: at present the international system does not recognise or respect our past, present and potential contribution...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Seek[s] repatriation of Indigenous peoples [cultural] resources already held in external collections, and seek[s] compensation and royalties from commercial developments resulting from these resources''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...encourage[s]...governments...to protest against any [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] provisions which facilitate the expropriation of Indigenous peoples'  knowledge and resources...[to instead] incorporate the concerns of Indigenous peoples...into legislation...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''[Seek to] Strengthen the capacities of Indigenous peoples to maintain their oral traditions, and encourage initiatives by Indigenous peoples to record their knowledge .. according to their customary access procedures.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Urge universities, churches, government, non-government organizations, and other institutions to reconsider their roles in the expropriation of Indigenous people's knowledge and resources and to assist in their return to their rightful owners."''&lt;ref name="FOUR004"&gt;FOURMILE 1996: Pages 270–272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Kimberley Declaration, August, 2002===

([[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], [[South Africa]] August 2002)

Indigenous people from around the world attended an international indigenous peoples' summit on sustainable development in Khoi-San Territory, [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], [[South Africa]], where they reaffirmed previous declarations and statements (above), and, amongst other matters, declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Our traditional knowledge systems must be respected, promoted and protected; our collective intellectual property rights must be guaranteed and ensured. Our traditional knowledge is not in the public domain; it is collective, cultural and intellectual property protected under our customary law. Unauthorized use and misappropriation of traditional knowledge is theft.''&lt;ref name="WIPO001"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, September, 2007 ===
{{main article|Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples}}
[[File:UN General Assembly.jpg|thumb|230px|right|United Nations General Assembly 2003]]
At the United Nation's General Assembly's 61st session, on 13 September 2007, an overwhelming majority of members resolved to adopt the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS | first =  | year = 2007 | url = http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/indigenous/declaration.htm | title = Declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples | format = WEB PAGE | work =  | publisher = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Article 11''': ''Indigenous peoples have the right to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs. This includes the right to maintain, protect and develop the past, present and future manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and historical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies, technologies and visual and performing arts and literature.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''States shall provide redress through effective mechanisms, which may include restitution, developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples, with respect to their cultural, intellectual, religious and spiritual property taken without their free, prior and informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs.''&lt;ref&gt;UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY Page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Article 24''': ''Indigenous peoples have the right to their traditional medicines and to maintain their health practices, including the conservation of their vital medicinal plants, animals and minerals...''&lt;ref name="UNGA001"&gt;UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY Page 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Article 31''': ''Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''In conjunction with indigenous peoples, States shall take effective measures to recognize and protect the exercise of these rights."''&lt;ref name="UNGA001"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism and Problems ==
Theory for intellectual property/privilege law is give creators temporary government monopoly for help creators earn their investments (patents and copyrights) but with idea after monopoly terminates everything becomes public domain for help create new innovation. Because of this theory, use intellectual property/privilege for control culture create many problems:

• Most culture items are too old for patent or copyright.  Additionally, often the author or creator unknown.

• Registration is not filed and fees are not paid

• Natural languages lie within the public domain

• Art styles lie within the public domain

• Properties of fauna and flora are scientific fact and their discovery and description can't have intellectual privilege for facts or information. Fauna and flora evolved, not created by humans.

• Can't own culture, it belongs to every person that uses it. This causes problems with human rights like expression freedom and choice.

• Cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions lie in the public domain.

• Powerful indigenous cultures in Europa (English, Italianos, Russians, etc) and Asia (Hindustanis, Han Chinese, etc.) can reverse this and forbid indigenous people from their culture (modern medicine, science, mathematics, printing, combustion engines, computer, etc) and languages (like English, Chinese, Arabic, etc.) and religions (Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, etc.)

• Indigenous people consume more outside culture than they can give

• Intellectual property owners must pay maintenance fee (patents).

• Proponents have not offered a solid concept of collective intellectual property rights, need a specific owner that can follow laws and must accept liability in courts.

• Names of all groups are generic, can't protect name Maori, Apache more than English, or Thai, Chinese.

• Intellectual property is an idea that belongs to European culture, therefore it fails to meet the needs of indigenous culture since it is too stuck up to see indigenous communities eye to eye and come to an understanding

• People innovate around restrictions

• May encourage use of stereotypes instead because outside people created them

• Restricting culture helps it become lost 

• Use of intellectual property/privilege this encourages the move against cultural prostitution.

== Traditional cultural expressions ==

The phrase "traditional cultural expressions" is used by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] to refer to "any form of artistic and literary expression in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied. They are transmitted from one generation to the next, and include handmade textiles, paintings, stories, legends, ceremonies, music, songs, rhythms and dance."&lt;ref name=Engaging&gt;{{citation|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|title=ENGAGING - A Guide to Interacting Respectfully and Reciprocally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and their Arts Practices and Intellectual Property|author=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] et al|publisher=Australian Government: Indigenous Culture Support|year=2015|p=7|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330114112/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|archivedate=30 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional cultural expressions can include designs and styles, which means that applying traditional Western-style international copyright laws{{snd}}which apply to a specific work, rather than a style{{snd}}can be problematic. Indigenous customary law often treats such concepts differently, and may apply restrictions upon the use of underlying styles and concepts.&lt;ref name=Engaging/&gt;

==Examples of Indigenous peoples claiming violation of their intellectual property==

===Intertribal Coalitions in North America===

Since the 1970s, Intertribal groups in North American have organized demonstrations against non-native use of Native American cultural elements; such as the sale of products and services allegedly derived from Indigenous knowledge:&lt;ref name=hagan&gt;Hagan, Helene E. [http://www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/features/spirg-hagan.html "The Plastic Medicine People Circle."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305155048/http://www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/features/spirg-hagan.html |date=5 March 2013 }} ''Sonoma Free County Press.'' Accessed 31 Jan 2013: "Shequish...came to the attention of Native American people two years ago as an impostor who pretended to have Shumash ancestry. I received a personal telephone call and a letter from the Chairman of a Shumash group south of Monterey. This phone call and a letter followed a Council meeting in which Shumash people took the decision to put a stop to Shequish Ohoho's activities in the Bay area as an 'Indian woman.' A group of real Indian women of San Francisco led a protest against Shequish and effectively terminated her money making seminars and ceremonies in this area. Her real name and background are known to California Indians who have denied her any tribal affiliation."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sieg1"&gt;Sieg, Katrin, ''Ethnic Drag: Performing Race, Nation, Sexuality in West Germany'';  University of Michigan Press (20 August 2002) p.232&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is a very alarming trend. So alarming that it came to the attention of an international and intertribal group of medicine people and spiritual leaders called the Circle of Elders. They were highly concerned with these activities and during one of their gatherings addressed the issue by publishing a list of Plastic Shamans in ''Akwesasne Notes'', along with a plea for them to stop their exploitative activities. One of the best known Plastic Shamans, Lynn Andrews, has been picketed by the Native communities in New York, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Seattle and other cities.&lt;ref name="Sieg1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota Peoples===

The 1993 Lakota Declaration of War (see above), urges people to identify instances where sacred traditions are being abused and to work toward stopping the abuse through demonstrations, boycotts, press coverage and direct intervention.&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt;

==== ''Ka Mate'' haka ====
[[File:Te Raparaha, chief of the Kawias, watercolour by R. Hall, c. 1840s.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Te Rauparaha]], alleged composer of ''Ka Mate''.]]
{{Main article|Ka Mate}}
Since the 19th century, Maori-style [[Haka]]s have been popularly-used by New Zealanders as [[Haka (sports)|a cheer at sporting events]]; especially for New Zealand national teams.  Between 1998 and 2006, the [[Ngati Toa]] [[iwi]] attempted to trademark the [[Ka Mate]] [[haka]] and to forbid its use by commercial organisations without their permission.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/793975.stm

|title= Iwi threatens to place trademark on All Black haka|work=The New Zealand Herald |date=2005-05-22 |accessdate=2008-05-03}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand]] turned their claim down in 2006, since ''Ka Mate'' had achieved wide recognition in New Zealand and abroad as representing New Zealand as a whole and not a particular trader.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10389347 |title=Iwi claim to All Black haka turned down|work=The New Zealand Herald |date=2007-07-02 |accessdate=2008-05-03}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, as a part of a wider settlement of grievances, the [[New Zealand government]] agreed to:
:"...record the authorship and significance of the haka Ka Mate to Ngāti Toa and ... work with Ngāti Toa to address their concerns with the haka... [but] does not expect that redress will result in royalties for the use of Ka Mate or provide Ngāti Toa with a veto on the performance of Ka Mate...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/livearticle.asp?ArtID=1234231829 Ngāti Toa Rangatira Letter of Agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521222630/http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/LiveArticle.asp?ArtID=1234231829 |date=21 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7882775.stm|title=New Zealand Maori win haka fight |date=11 February 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a survey of nineteenth-century New Zealand newspapers found Ka Mate was used by tribes from other parts of New Zealand, and was generally described by them as being an ancient peacekeeping song, from eras long before its appropriation by the Ngati Toa chief Te Rauparaha. When Ngati Toa authorities were asked for evidence that Ka Mate was of Ngati Toa authorship, they were unable to provide any.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folksong.org.nz/ka_mate/ka_mate.pdf|title=Archer J.H.

==== Lego's Bionicle ====

In 2001 a dispute concerning the popular [[LEGO]] toy-line "[[Bionicle]]" arose between [[Denmark|Danish]] toymaker [[Lego Group]] and several Māori tribal groups (fronted by lawyer Maui Solomon) and members of the on-line discussion forum ([[Aotearoa Cafe]]). The Bionicle product line allegedly used many words [[Cultural appropriation|appropriated]] from Māori language, imagery and folklore. The dispute ended in an amicable settlement. Initially Lego refused to withdraw the product, saying it had drawn the names from many cultures, but later agreed that it had taken the names from Māori and agreed to change certain names or spellings to help set the toy-line apart from the Māori legends. This did not prevent the many Bionicle users from continuing to use the disputed words, resulting in the popular Bionicle website BZPower coming under a [[denial-of-service attack]] for four days from an attacker using the name Kotiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2002/11/56451|title=Lego Site Irks Maori Sympathizer|last=Griggs|first=Kim|date=21 November 2002 |work=Wired|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a New Zealander in [[Jerusalem]] discovered that the [[Philip Morris International|Phillip Morris]] cigarette company had started producing a brand of cigarette in Israel called the "L &amp; M Maori mix".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411319/638858 |title=Disgust over 'Maori' brand cigarettes |date=12 December 2005 |work=TVNZ |accessdate=29 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613105447/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411319/638858 |archivedate=13 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the head of Phillip Morris, [[Louis C.

===Hopi and Apache Opt-Out From American Museums===

In 1994 certain Native American tribal organisations demanded that a number of museums remove certain materials from exhibition and access to the public. They cited the [[NAGPRA]] as the legal basis for their complaints.  Their position was that they would only permit such uses, selectively. after permission was requested directly to them.
Vernon Masayesva, CEO of the Hopi Tribe, and a consortium of Apache tribes demanded a number of American museums end public exhibition of and access to materials from their tribal cultures; including images, text, ceremonies, music, songs, stories, symbols, beliefs, customs, ideas, concepts and ethnographic field-notes, feature films, historical works, and any other medium in which their culture may appear literally, imagined, expressed, parodied or embellished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brown | first = Michael F. | authorlink =  | title = Can Culture Be Copyrighted? | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–222 | date = April 1998 | url = | jstor = 10.1086/204721 | doi=10.1086/204721}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 12 Dec 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Japodian burial urns''' are a series of fifteen burial urns made by the [[Illyrian tribe]] of the [[Japodes]] around the area of [[Bihać]] in [[Bosnia]]. These cremation urns where the cremated remains of the dead were placed in, were beautifully decorated with figurative designs of humans and animals. The Japodian burial urn art was a unique form of art influenced to a degree by the [[Situla (vessel)|Situla]] art of northern Illyria and Italy and by Greek art. The urns represent one of the best Japodian figurative art forms.

The first urn was discovered in 1890 in the necropolis of Jezerina near Bihać. In this fragment the face of a warrior was presented with a helmet, a drinking horn on the right hand and with a spear on the left hand. Almost all of the scenes are linked with the cult of the dead. The urns are broken up in three fazes, grouped up chronologically. The earliest date from the 5th century BC and even probably from the start of the 4th century BC and depict figures related with those of the situla art. The Japodian artists which created the early urns were inspired by the situla art and took many motives from this art, but which transformed the images in order to suit their own tastes. From this the second faze was created but with a much smaller yield. The second faze is linked with Greek art. The third group dates from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era and presents a highly developed form of Japodian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stipčević|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?''''' is a 2009 book on [[political philosophy]] by [[Michael J. Sandel]].

== Background ==
The work was written to accompany Sandel's famous "Justice" course at [[Harvard University]] which he has taught for more than thirty years and which has been offered online and in various TV summary versions. There is also an accompanying sourcebook of readings: ''Justice: A Reader''.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;

== Summary ==
Sandel addresses a series of alternative theories of justice. The [[utilitarianism]] of [[Jeremy Bentham]] is outlined and criticised and then [[John Stuart Mill]]'s refinements are discussed. The [[libertarians]], in particular [[Robert Nozick]], and their arguments are discussed. Then Sandel discusses [[Immanuel Kant]] and his '[[categorical imperative]]'. The discussion then goes on to [[John Rawls]]'s work.  Then [[Aristotle]] and the concept of '[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]' is discussed. It is here that Sandel begins to make clear his own perspective. He argues that justice, rather than being autonomous (as Kantians or Rawlsians might have it), has a goal. A form of [[communitarianism]]. Sandel quotes [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and his characterisation of humans as being 'storytelling beings' who live their lives with ''narrative quests''.

== Reception ==
Despite the controversial and polarizing nature of the material, the reviews have largely been positive. ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Sandel's ability to teach and says, "If 'Justice' breaks no new philosophical ground, it succeeds at something perhaps no less important: in terms we can all understand, it confronts us with the concepts that lurk, so often unacknowledged, beneath our conflicts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/books/review/Rauch-t.html|title=Book Review {{!}} 'Justice: What’s the Right Thing to Do?,' by Michael J.

This '''list of oldest heraldry''' aims to include the oldest documented, non-[[Attributed arms|attributed]] [[heraldic achievement]]s for [[individual]]s, [[family|families]], locations or [[institution]]s.

Heraldry developed in the [[high medieval period]], based on earlier, "pre-heraldic" or "ante-heraldic", traditions of visual identification by means of  [[Seal (emblem)|seal]]s,  [[field sign]]s, emblems used on [[numismatics|coins]], etc. Notably, [[lion (heraldry)|lions]] that would subsequently appear in 12th-century coats of arms of European nobility have pre-figurations in the [[animal style]] of ancient art (specifically  the style of [[Scythian art]] as it developed from c. the 7th century BC).&lt;ref&gt;"significant pre-figuration of medieval heraldry"  John Onians, ''Atlas of World Art'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 58].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The origin of the term ''[[:wikt:heraldry|heraldry]]'' itself ([[Middle English]] ''heraldy'', [[Old French]] ''hiraudie''), can be placed in the context of the early forms of the [[Tournament (medieval)|knightly tournament]]s in the 12th century. Combattants wore full armour, and identified themselves by wearing their emblems on their [[heater shield|shields]]. A [[herald]] (Old French ''heraut'', from a [[Frankish language|Frankish]] ''*hariwald'' "commander of an army") was an officer who would announce the competitors. 
The display of heraldic emblems on shields is an innovation of the 12th century. The [[kite shield]]s shown in the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] (c. 1070) sometimes show simple [[:File:Bayeux Tapestry scene57 Harold death (cropped).jpg|cross or spiral]] ornaments, but no heraldic emblems. Similarly, Frankish or German [[round shield]]s of the 11th century ([[Ottonian]], [[Salian dynasty|Salian]]) are sometimes depicted with simple geometric ornamentation, but not with figurative emblems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vikingage.org/wiki/wiki/Round_Shield_Designs Round Shield Designs (vikingage.org)]: "chequered" (11th c., Biblio. Mun. Avranches MS50), "flared cross" (c.1000-1050 Arras, BM MS 559 (435), vol. 1), 
"spirals" (c.1000-1050 Arras, BM MS 559 (435), vol. 1), "spirals with dots" (c.1000-1020 Bamberg MS A. II. 42 Bamberg Apocalypse).&lt;/ref&gt;
Early mention of heraldic shields in [[Middle High German literature]] likewise dates to the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;"With the exception of several heraldic shields that appear in the ''[[Kaiserchronik]]'' [c. 1150&amp;ndash;1170], such as the boar carried by the Romans&amp;mdash;the oldest heraldic insignia in medieval German epic literature, according to Zips [''Wappenwesen'', 1966]&amp;mdash;most of the precourtly and even courtly epics up to 1200 contain very few decorated shields at all. Several isolated coats of arms are mentioned in the German ''[[The Song of Roland|Rolandslied]]'' [c. 1115], ''[[King Rother|König Rother]]'' [c. 1150], [[Heinrich von Veldeke|Veldecke's ''Eneas'']] [c. 1170], and [[Erec (poem)|Hartmann's ''Erec'']] [c. 1185]&amp;mdash;mostly related ot the protagonists."

Lions were used as heraldic emblems by [[Henry I of England]] (d. 1135),{{cn|date=November 2018}} [[Henry the Lion|Henry "the Lion"]] (before 1146), and [[Alfonso VII of León]] (d. 1157) in the first half of the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Riquer/&gt;
The oldest surviving heraldic seals are the [[equestrian seal]]s (German: ''Reitersiegel'') used by high nobility in the second half of the 12th century. Among the oldest examples from the [[Holy Roman Empire]], of what would develop into [[German heraldry]], is the lion (or "leopard") of the [[Hohenstaufen|Staufer]] coat of arms, first used before 1146 by Henry "the Lion", and in 1181 on the seal of [[Frederick VI, Duke of Swabia|Frederick VI of Swabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Werner Hechberger, ''Staufer und Welfen 1125-1190: zur Verwendung von Theorien in der Geschichtswissenschaft'' (1996), 1996 p. 342; Xenja von Ertzdorff, Rudolf Schulz, Winfried Baumann, ''Die Romane von dem Ritter mit dem Löwen'' (1994), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=G5Gc-YGXDeoC&amp;pg=PA174  p. 174].&lt;/ref&gt; Similar seals are known from England, the oldest being the equestrian seal of King [[Richard Lionheart]] of the [[House of Plantagenet]], dated 1189, showing a heraldic lion design on the king's shield. His second seal, dated 1198, shows the three lions design which would subsequently become the [[royal coat of arms of England]].

The earliest known colored heraldic representation appears on the funerary enamel of [[Geoffrey of Anjou]] (d. 1151), showing a coat of arms that appears to be the same as one later used by some of his descendants.

| Personal coat of arms
| [[Henry the Lion]]
| Among the oldest equestrial seals preserved are those of [[Henry the Lion]] of the [[House of Welf]], duke of Saxony (1142&amp;ndash;1180) and Bavaria (1156&amp;ndash;1180). A total of seven seals of Henry's are known. Of these, only the second shows a recognizable [[heraldic lion|lion]] displayed on his shield. This seal is attached to two documents dated to 1146. It is possible that the lion was also on the first seal (c. 1142), but it is no longer recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;Xenja von Ertzdorff, Rudolf Schulz, Winfried Baumann, ''Die Romane von dem Ritter mit dem Löwen'' (1994), p. 175,
citing Schmidt-Phiseldeck, '' Die Siegel des herzoglichen Hauses Braunschweig und Lüneburg'', nr. 1&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt;
An equestrian seal of similar antiquity is [[:File:Ottokar III of Styria 1160.jpg|that]] of [[Ottokar III of Styria]], dated 1160, with an early form of the [[Styria]]n [[Panther (legendary creature)|panther]] on his shield.

| Personal coat of arms
| [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]]
| Appearing on funerary enamel commissioned by Geoffrey's widow [[Empress Matilda|Mathilda of England]] between 1155 and 1160 for his tomb ([[Le Mans Cathedral]]).  Often cited as the first documented personal coat of arms. The enamel shows four lions on the visible half of the shield, but is generally accepted as representing the same six-lion coat depicted on his grandson [[William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|William Longespee]]'s tomb effigy and known to have had the same tinctures.  A late-12th-century chronicler wrote that in 1128, [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] presented to Geoffrey a badge of a gold lion.&lt;ref name=he&gt;Wagner, A. (1946).  ''Heraldry in England''&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars represent this as an earlier description of the same heraldic device, and perhaps the same coat of arms. Depiction of heraldic shields in manuscript miniatures becomes more common in the early-to-mid 13th century, and dedicated [[Roll of arms|armorials]] become fashionable in the mid-to-late 13th century.

|1188
|
|
|Personal coat of arms
|[[Frederick VI, Duke of Swabia]]
|  Frederick VI is known to have displayed a lion rampant from 1181. His ''Reitersiegel'', dated 1188 (original lost in 1847), shows his shield as displaying two lions rampant. 
Frederick's younger brother [[Philip of Swabia]] (r. 1196&amp;ndash;1208) used three lions, seen on a seal dated 1197. The three lions passant are later (after 1220) used as the family coat of arms of the  [[Hohenstaufen|Staufer]], and still later as the coat of arms of [[Swabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Koblank, [https://www.stauferstelen.net/texts/stauferwappen.htm Stauferwappen] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

| Personal coat of arms
| [[King Richard the Lionheart]]
| The first documented [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|royal coat of arms of England]]. With only half of the shield visible, it is unclear if the unseen half had a second lion or if only the visible lion was present, and if the latter, whether the direction the lion faced was relevant or simply reflected artistic licence. Colours are unknown, but several close kin of his father used arms with one or more gold lions on a red background, so these were perhaps the tinctures of this shield.

| [[Conrad of Thuringia]] 
| The depiction of heraldic designs on actual cavalry shields (knightly shields), the historical origin of the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]], no doubt date to their depiction on seals in the 12th century. However, this artefact type is very rarely preserved, and the oldest extant examples date to the first half of the 13th century. An early example is the shield  of [[Conrad of Thuringia]] (c. 1230), showing the [[Ludovingians|Ludovingian]]''lion barry'' (later the coat of arms of [[Coat of arms of Hesse|Hessen and Thuringia]]).

| c. 1260
| 
| 
| [[Burgher arms]] ([[Maritime republics|Italian republics]])
| ([[Republic of Siena|Siena]], [[Republic of Florence|Florence]])
| Italian merchants and bankers first adopt heraldic emblems in the mid 13th-century. &lt;ref&gt;"The thirteenth century also witnessed the adoption of armorial devices by some at least of the merchants. In 1263 the arms of the 'Four Provisors' of the Biccherna at Siena were painted on the cover of the tax-book for that year inaugurating that well known and valuable series. At Florence in the same year Raynuttio Ardengi, a merchant of that city, sealed with a shield Barry of eight set between the attires of a stag's head." John A Goodall, [https://www.theheraldrysociety.com/articles/heraldry-in-italy-during-the-middle-ages-and-renaissance/ "Heraldry in Italy during the Middle Ages and Renaissance"], ''Coat of Arms'' 37 (January 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Papal coat of arms|"Papal" coat of arms]]
| [[Pope Boniface VIII]]
| Popes of the late medieval and early modern period used their family coats of arms (the earliest exception being [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]], r. 1447&amp;ndash;1455). The coat of arms of Boniface VIII (r. 1294&amp;ndash;1303), an early form of the [[Caetani]] coat of arms, happens to be the first coat of arms used by a pope preserved in a contemporary depiction.
&lt;ref&gt;
"We have seen that Pope Clement IV granted his own arms to the Guelfs of Florence, but the first Pope for whom there is contemporary evidence for th arms actually used by him is Boniface VIII after about 1295. A tablet recording the foundation of an oratory by Tommaso Andrei Bishop of Pistoia in 1296 has two small shields of his arms a Rose or cinquefoil between three roundels. After 1300 the evidence for the use of arms by ecclesiastics of all ranks becomes more frequent and there can be little doubt but that the late date of their adoption when compared with France or Germany is due to the conservative influence of the Roman Curia." John A Goodall, [https://www.theheraldrysociety.com/articles/heraldry-in-italy-during-the-middle-ages-and-renaissance/ "Heraldry in Italy during the Middle Ages and Renaissance"], ''Coat of Arms'' 37 (January 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

| The earliest coats of arms taken by non-nobles, mostly families of the patriciate of [[Free imperial city|imperial cities]] (''Bürgerwappen''), but also [[Imperial Village|free farmers]] (''Bauernwappen''), appear in the 14th century. An early example of coats of arms attributed to commoners are found in ''[[Codex Manesse]]'', "masters" (''[[Meister]]'', a title given to commoners) [[Heinrich Frauenlob]] and [[Heinrich Teschler]] (shown here is Teschler's coat of arms from ''Codex Manesse''. The name ''Teschler'' translates to "bag maker", and the coat of arms shows ''argent a bag sable'').

{{History of printing}}
'''Lithography''' ({{ety|grc|''[[wikt:λίθος|λίθος]]'', lithos|stone||''[[wikt:γράφειν|γράφειν]]'', graphein|to write}})&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lithography |volume=16 |pages=785–789 |first=Frederick Vincent |last=Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of [[printing]] originally based on the [[miscibility|immiscibility]] of oil and water.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Peter. (1964) ''The Technique of Lithography''. London: [[B.T. Batsford]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The printing is from a stone ([[lithographic limestone]]) or a metal plate with a smooth surface. It was invented in 1796 by German author and actor [[Alois Senefelder]] as a cheap method of publishing theatrical works.&lt;ref name="meggspage146"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. (1998) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. p 146 {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carterpage11"&gt;Carter, Rob, Ben Day, Philip Meggs. Typographic Design: Form and Communication, Third Edition. (2002) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. p 11&lt;/ref&gt; Lithography can be used to print text or [[artwork (graphic arts)|artwork]] onto paper or other suitable material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lithography and Lithographers |publisher=T. Fisher Unwin Publisher |place=London |year=1915 |editor=Pennel ER |url=https://archive.org/details/lithographylitho00penn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithography originally used an image drawn with oil, fat, or wax onto the surface of a smooth, level [[lithographic limestone]] plate. The stone was treated with a mixture of acid and [[gum arabic]], ''[[etching]]'' the portions of the stone that were not protected by the grease-based image. When the stone was subsequently moistened, these etched areas retained water; an [[offset ink|oil-based ink]] could then be applied and would be repelled by the water, sticking only to the original drawing. The ink would finally be transferred to a blank [[paper]] sheet, producing a [[printing|printed page]]. This traditional technique is still used in some [[fine art]] printmaking applications.

In modern lithography, the image is made of a [[polymer]] coating applied to a flexible plastic or metal plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stbarnabaspress.co.uk/digital-photographic.html|title=Digital &amp; Photographic|first=James|last=Hill|website=www.stbarnabaspress.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image can be printed directly from the plate (the orientation of the image is reversed), or it can be [[offset printing|offset]], by transferring the image onto a flexible sheet (rubber) for printing and publication.

As a printing technology, lithography is different from [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printing]] (gravure), wherein a plate is either [[engraving|engraved]], [[etching|etched]], or [[mezzotint|stippled]] to score cavities to contain the printing ink; and [[woodblock printing]] or [[letterpress]] printing, wherein ink is applied to the raised surfaces of letters or images. Today, most types of high-volume books and magazines, especially when illustrated in colour, are printed with [[offset lithography]], which has become the most common form of printing technology since the 1960s.

The related term "[[photolithography]]" refers to when photographic images are used in lithographic printing, whether these images are printed directly from a stone or from a metal plate, as in offset printing. "Photolithography" is used synonymously with "offset printing".  The technique as well as the term were introduced in Europe in the 1850s. Beginning in the 1960s, photolithography has played an important role in the fabrication and [[mass production]] of [[integrated circuit]]s  in the [[microelectronics industry]].&lt;ref&gt;Hannavy, John. editor. ''Encyclopedia of nineteenth-century photography: A-I, index, Volume 1.'' Taylor &amp; Francis (2008). {{ISBN|9780415972352}}. page 865.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mansuripur, Masud. ''Classical Optics and Its Applications''. Cambridge University Press (2002) {{ISBN|9780521804998}}. page 416&lt;/ref&gt;

==The principle of lithography==
Lithography uses simple chemical processes to create an image.  For instance, the positive part of an image is a water-repelling ("[[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]]") substance, while the negative image would be water-retaining ("[[hydrophilic]]").  Thus, when the plate is introduced to a compatible printing ink and water mixture, the ink will adhere to the positive image and the water will clean the negative image.  This allows a flat print plate to be used, enabling much longer and more detailed print runs than the older physical methods of printing (e.g., [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printing]], [[letterpress printing]]).

Lithography was invented by [[Alois Senefelder]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] in 1796.  In the early days of lithography, a smooth piece of [[limestone]] was used (hence the name "lithography": "lithos" (λιθος) is the ancient Greek word for stone).  After the oil-based image was put on the surface, a solution of [[gum arabic]] in water was applied, the gum sticking only to the non-oily surface. During printing, water adhered to the gum arabic surfaces and was repelled by the oily parts, while the oily ink used for printing did the opposite.

===Lithography on limestone===
[[Image:Litography negative stone and positive paper.jpg|thumb|Lithography stone and [[mirror image]] print of a map of Munich]]

Lithography works because of the mutual [[Hydrophobe|repulsion of oil and water]]. The image is drawn on the surface of the print plate with a fat or oil-based medium (hydrophobic) such as a wax crayon, which may be pigmented to make the drawing visible. A wide range of oil-based media is available, but the durability of the image on the stone depends on the [[lipid]] content of the material being used, and its ability to withstand water and acid. After the drawing of the image, an aqueous [[solution]] of [[gum arabic]], weakly acidified with nitric acid {{chem|HNO|3}} is applied to the stone. The function of this solution is to create a hydrophilic layer of [[calcium nitrate]] salt, {{chem|Ca(NO|3|)|2}}, and gum arabic on all non-image surfaces.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The gum solution penetrates into the pores of the stone, completely surrounding the original image with a hydrophilic layer that will not accept the printing ink. Using lithographic [[turpentine]], the printer then removes any excess of the greasy drawing material, but a hydrophobic molecular film of it remains tightly bonded to the surface of the stone, rejecting the gum arabic and water, but ready to accept the oily ink.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Hoen &amp; Co.|A. B. Hoen]], Discussion of the Requisite Qualities of Lithographic Limestone, with Report on Tests of the Lithographic Stone of Mitchell County, Iowa, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XBIMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PA339&amp;pg=RA1-PA339 Iowa Geological Survey Annual Report, 1902], Des Moines, 1903; pages 339–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gascoigne|first1=Bamber|title=How to Identify Prints: a complete guide to manual and mechanical processes from woodcut to ink jet|date=1988|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=Spain|page=1c}}&lt;/ref&gt; When printing, the stone is kept wet with water. Naturally the water is attracted to the layer of gum and salt created by the acid wash. [[Printing ink]] based on drying oils such as [[linseed oil]] and varnish loaded with [[pigment]] is then rolled over the surface. The water repels the greasy ink but the hydrophobic areas left by the original drawing material accept it. When the hydrophobic image is loaded with ink, the stone and paper are run through a press that applies even pressure over the surface, transferring the ink to the paper and off the stone.

Senefelder had experimented during the early 19th century with multicolor lithography; in his 1819 book, he predicted that the process would eventually be perfected and used to reproduce paintings.&lt;ref name="meggspage146"/&gt; Multi-color printing was introduced by a new process developed by [[Godefroy Engelmann]] (France) in 1837 known as [[chromolithography]].&lt;ref name="meggspage146"/&gt; A separate stone was used for each color, and a print went through the press separately for each stone. The main challenge was to keep the images aligned (''[[Printing registration|in register]]''). This method lent itself to images consisting of large areas of flat color, and resulted in the characteristic poster designs of this period.

"Lithography, or printing from soft stone, largely took the place of engraving in the production of English commercial maps after about 1852. It was a quick, cheap process and had been used to print British army maps during the [[Peninsula War]]. Most of the commercial maps of the second half of the 19th century were lithographed and unattractive, though accurate enough."&lt;ref&gt;Lynam, Edward. 1944. British Maps and Map Makers. London: W. Collins. Page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern lithographic process===
{{main|Offset printing}}
[[Image:Gubernie zachodnie krolestwo polskie 1902.jpg|thumb|A 1902 lithograph map (original size 33×24 cm)]]

High-volume lithography is used presently to produce posters, maps, books, newspapers, and packaging—just about any smooth, mass-produced item with print and graphics on it. Most books, indeed all types of high-volume text, are now printed using [[Offset printing|offset lithography]].

For offset lithography, which depends on photographic processes, flexible aluminum, polyester, mylar or paper printing plates are used instead of stone tablets. Modern printing plates have a brushed or roughened texture and are covered with a photosensitive [[emulsion]].  A photographic negative of the desired image is placed in contact with the emulsion and the plate is exposed to ultraviolet light. After development, the emulsion shows a reverse of the negative image, which is thus a duplicate of the original (positive) image. The image on the plate emulsion can also be created by direct laser imaging in a CTP ([[Computer to plate|Computer-To-Plate]]) device known as a platesetter. The positive image is the emulsion that remains after imaging. Non-image portions of the emulsion have traditionally been removed by a chemical process, though in recent times plates have come available that do not require such processing.

[[Image:Litography press with map of Moosburg 02.jpg|thumb|left|Lithography press for printing maps in Munich]]
[[Image:Lithography machine in Bibliotheca Alexandrina.jpg|thumb|right|Lithography machine in [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]]]
The plate is affixed to a cylinder on a printing press. Dampening rollers apply water, which covers the blank portions of the plate but is repelled by the emulsion of the image area. Hydrophobic ink, which is repelled by the water and only adheres to the emulsion of the image area, is then applied by the inking rollers.

If this image were transferred directly to paper, it would create a mirror-type image and the paper would become too wet. Instead, the plate rolls against a cylinder covered with a rubber ''blanket'', which squeezes away the water, picks up the ink and transfers it to the paper with uniform pressure. The paper passes between the blanket cylinder and a counter-pressure or impression cylinder and the image is transferred to the paper. Because the image is first transferred, or ''offset'' to the rubber blanket cylinder, this reproduction method is known as ''offset lithography'' or ''[[offset printing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;see diagram at [http://www.compassrose.com/static/Offset.jpg compassrose.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many innovations and technical refinements have been made in printing processes and presses over the years, including the development of [[Printing press|presses]] with multiple units (each containing one printing plate) that can print multi-color images in one pass on both sides of the sheet, and presses that accommodate continuous rolls (''webs'') of paper, known as web presses. Another innovation was the continuous dampening system first introduced by Dahlgren, instead of the old method (conventional dampening) which is still used on older presses, using rollers covered with molleton (cloth) that absorbs the water. This increased control of the water flow to the plate and allowed for better ink and water balance. Current dampening systems include a "delta effect or vario," which slows the roller in contact with the plate, thus creating a sweeping movement over the ink image to clean impurities known as "hickies".

The process of lithography printing is illustrated by [http://www.istc.illinois.edu/info/library_docs/manuals/printing/images/offsetlitho.gif this simplified diagram]. This press is also called an ink pyramid because the ink is transferred through several layers of rollers with different purposes. Fast lithographic 'web' printing presses are commonly used in newspaper production.

The advent of [[desktop publishing]] made it possible for type and images to be modified easily on personal computers for eventual printing by desktop or commercial presses. The development of digital [[imagesetter]]s enabled print shops to produce negatives for platemaking directly from digital input, skipping the intermediate step of photographing an actual page layout. The development of the digital [[platesetter]] during the late 20th century eliminated film negatives altogether by exposing printing plates directly from digital input, a process known as [[computer to plate]] printing.

==Microlithography and nanolithography==
{{Main|Photolithography}}
Microlithography and [[nanolithography]] refer specifically to lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 [[micrometers]] are considered microlithographic, and features smaller than 100 [[nanometers]] are considered nanolithographic. [[Photolithography]] is one of these methods, often applied to [[semiconductor]] manufacturing of [[integrated circuit|microchips]]. Photolithography is also commonly used for fabricating [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated [[photomask]] or reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.

Although photolithographic technology is the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques are also used. Some, for example [[electron beam lithography]], are capable of much greater patterning resolution (sometimes as small as a few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of [[maskless lithography]], in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans across a [[resist]]-coated substrate. Electron beam lithography has the disadvantage of being much slower than photolithography.

In addition to these commercially well-established techniques, a large number of promising microlithographic and [[nanolithography|nanolithographic]] technologies exist or are being developed, including [[nanoimprint lithography]], [[interference lithography]], [[X-ray lithography]], [[extreme ultraviolet lithography]], [[magnetolithography]] and [[scanning probe lithography]]. Some of these new techniques have been used successfully for small-scale commercial and important research applications.
Surface-charge lithography, in fact [[Plasma desorption mass spectrometry]] can be directly patterned on polar dielectric crystals via pyroelectric effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grilli | first1 = S. | last2 = Vespini | first2 = V. | last3 = Ferraro | first3 = P. | year = 2008 | title = Surface-charge lithography for direct pdms micro-patterning | url = | journal = Langmuir | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 13262–13265 | doi = 10.1021/la803046j | pmid=18986187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lithography as an artistic medium==
[[File:Redon smiling-spider.jpg|thumb|left|''Smiling Spider'' by [[Odilon Redon]], 1891]]
During the first years of the 19th century, lithography had only a limited effect on [[printmaking]], mainly because technical difficulties remained to be overcome. Germany was the main center of production in this period. [[Godefroy Engelmann]], who moved his press from [[Mulhouse]] to Paris in 1816, largely succeeded in resolving the technical problems, and during the 1820s lithography was adopted by artists such as [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] and [[Géricault]]. After early experiments such as ''Specimens of Polyautography'' (1803),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=''Specimens of Polyautography, Consisting of Impressions taken from Original Drawings, Made on Stone purposely for this Work’' | date=1803|  publisher=Philipp André| location=London|  url=http://primo.getty.edu/GRI:GETTY_ALMA21118663020001551}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had experimental works by  a number of British artists including [[Benjamin West]], [[Henry Fuseli]],  [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], [[Thomas Barker of Bath]],  [[Thomas Stothard]],   [[Henry Richard Greville]], [[Richard Cooper Jr.|Richard Cooper]],   [[Henry Singleton (painter)|Henry Singleton]], and  [[William Henry Pyne]], London also became a center, and some of Géricault's prints were in fact produced there. [[Goya]] in Bordeaux produced his last series of prints by lithography—''The Bulls of Bordeaux'' of 1828. By the mid-century the initial enthusiasm had somewhat diminished in both countries, although the use of lithography was increasingly favored for commercial applications, which included the prints of [[Daumier]], published in newspapers. [[Rodolphe Bresdin]] and [[Jean-François Millet]] also continued to practice the medium in France, and [[Adolf Menzel]] in Germany. In 1862 the publisher Cadart tried to initiate a portfolio of lithographs by various artists, which was not successful but included several prints by [[Manet]]. The revival began during the 1870s, especially in France with artists such as [[Odilon Redon]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]] and [[Degas]] producing much of their work in this manner. The need for strictly limited [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]s to maintain the price had now been realized, and the medium became more accepted.

[[File:Edvard Munch - Self-Portrait (1895) G0192-59 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Self Portrait with Skeleton Arm'' by [[Edvard Munch]]]]
In the 1890s, color lithography gained success in part by the emergence of [[Jules Chéret]], known as the ''father of the modern poster'', whose work went on to inspire a new generation of poster designers and painters, most notably [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], and former student of Chéret, [[Georges de Feure]]. By 1900 the medium in both color and monotone was an accepted part of printmaking.

During the 20th century, a group of artists, including [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Alexander Calder|Calder]], [[Chagall]], [[Dufy]], [[Léger]], [[Matisse]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], and [[Picasso]], rediscovered the largely undeveloped artform of lithography thanks to the [[Mourlot Studios]], also known as ''Atelier Mourlot'', a Parisian printshop founded in 1852 by the Mourlot family. The Atelier Mourlot originally specialized in the printing of wallpaper; but it was transformed when the founder's grandson, [[Fernand Mourlot]], invited a number of 20th-century artists to explore the complexities of fine art printing. Mourlot encouraged the painters to work directly on lithographic stones in order to create original artworks that could then be executed under the direction of master printers in small editions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/36544351/PICASSO_LITHOGRAPHER_AND_ACTIVIST|title=Picasso lithographer and activist|last=Orozco|first=Miguel|publisher=Academia.edu|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The combination of modern artist and master printer resulted in lithographs that were used as posters to promote the artists' work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiaf.org/laboutique/mourlot History of 20th century lithography by Picasso, Matisse, Chagall, Braque, Leger at Atelier Mourlot, French Institute Alliance Française] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723085822/http://www.fiaf.org/laboutique/mourlot |date=July 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mourlot, Fernand. ''Twentieth Century Posters.'' Wellfleet Press: Secaucus, New Jersey, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grant Wood]], [[George Bellows]], [[Alphonse Mucha]], [[Max Kahn]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Eleanor Coen]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[David Hockney]], [[Susan Dorothea White]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] are a few of the artists who have produced most of their prints in the medium. [[M. C. Escher]] is considered a master of lithography, and many of his prints were created using this process. More than other printmaking techniques, [[printmaker]]s in lithography still largely depend on access to good [[Printer (publishing)|printer]]s, and the development of the medium has been greatly influenced by when and where these have been established.
{{Further|List of printmakers}}
As a special form of lithography, the serilith process is sometimes used. Seriliths are mixed media original prints created in a process in which an artist uses the [[lithograph]] and [[serigraph]] processes. The separations for both processes are hand-drawn by the artist. The serilith technique is used primarily to create fine art limited print editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrysideart.com/serigraphy.htm|title=What is a Serilith?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''McVicker's Theater''' (1857–1984) was a playhouse in [[Chicago, Illinois]], United States. Built for actor James Hubert McVicker, the theater was the leading stage for comedic plays in Chicago's early years. It often hosted performances by [[Edwin Booth]], who married McVicker's daughter and was once targeted there in an attempted murder. [[Adler &amp; Sullivan]] designed a remodel in 1883. Although destroyed in two fires, including the [[Great Chicago Fire]], McVicker's remained an operating theater until 1984. It was demolished the next year

==History==
[[File:James H. McVicker.jpg|right|thumb|Founder James Hubert McVicker]]
James Hubert McVicker was born in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on February 14, 1822. His father James died shortly after his birth, so he was raised by his mother Nancy and two siblings. He attended some public school before apprenticing as a printer when he was ten. For the next five years, he operated machines in New York printing houses. In October 1837, he was hired as an apprentice for the ''[[St. Louis Republican|Republican]]'' in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and was named a journeyman three years later. However he found little enjoyment in the trade and he decided to acquire a classic education.&lt;ref name=Flinn&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Flinn|editor-first=John J.|title=The Hand-book of Chicago Biography|publisher=The Standard Guide Company|year=1893|place=Chicago, IL|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, he entered a production at the [[St. Charles Theater]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. McVicker traveled to various cities around the country to perform. In April 1848, he settled in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. The comedian who had worked at [[John Blake Rice]]'s theater was just about to leave and Rice offered his position to McVicker. His first performance there was on May 2, 1848 in ''My Neighbor's Wife''. His wife also performed, starring in ''Hue and Cry''.&lt;ref name=Flinn/&gt; McVicker starred opposite Rice's wife in ''Lend Me Five Shillings'' on April 27, 1849.&lt;ref name=theatre&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freiserger|first=Edward|title=Theatre Beginnings in Chicago|journal=The Theatre Magazine|volume=XIII|issue=124|date=June 1911|pp=198–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after the death of [[Dan Marble]], McVicker purchased the right to use his plays from the family estate. He went on a national tour and then toured [[England]] in 1855. The next year, McVicker became manager of the People's Theater in St. Louis. The playhouse was very successful and in March 1857 he used the proceeds to establish a new theater in Chicago. McVicker's Theater opened on November 5, 1857 featuring its own stock company performing the comedic plays ''Honeymoon'' and ''Rough Diamond''.&lt;ref name=theatre/&gt;

[[Edwin Booth]] starred in ''[[A New Way to Pay Old Debts]]'' on May 31, 1858. He would later perform ''[[Richelieu (play)|Richelieu]]'', ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', and ''[[Brutus (play)|Brutus]]'' there, and he married one of McVicker's daughters in 1869. The theater was remodeled in 1864. [[James Henry Hackett]] performed as [[Falstaff]] in 1865. It was again extensively remodeled in August 1871, but was destroyed in the [[Great Chicago Fire]] weeks later. However, it was rebuilt, and reopened on August 15, 1872. [[Mark Gray (attempted assassin)|Mark Gray]] fired two bullets in an unsuccessful attempt to murder Edwin Booth on April 23, 1879 while the actor was performing ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]''.&lt;ref name=theatre/&gt;

Actors who performed in McVicker's company over the years included [[James O'Neill (actor)|James O'Neill]] and [[Robert B. Mantell]]. McVicker's was remodeled again in 1883 by [[Adler &amp; Sullivan]], but again destroyed in a fire in 1890. The rebuilt theater, designed by the same, opened on March 31, 1891 with a performance of ''[[The Rivals]]'' featuring [[Joseph Jefferson]], [[William J. Florence]], [[Louisa Lane Drew]], and [[Viola Allen]]. McVicker died on March 7, 1896. His widow assumed management until she sold the theater to Jacob Litt on May 1, 1898.&lt;ref name=theatre/&gt; The theater was demolished and rebuilt in 1922. [[Balaban &amp; Katz]] purchased the building in 1926. It later showed films until it was shut down in 1984. It was demolished the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Balaban|first=David|title=The Chicago Movie Palaces of Balaban and Katz|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|place=Chicago, IL|year=2006|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Medieval]] fortification''' refers to [[medieval technology|medieval]] military methods that cover the development of [[fortification]] construction and use in [[Europe]], roughly from the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] to the [[Renaissance]]. During this millennium, fortifications changed [[Medieval warfare|warfare]], and in turn were modified to suit new [[military tactics|tactics]], [[weapon]]s and [[siege]] techniques.

==Fortification types==

===Archer towers===
[[Image:TurnulChindiei.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chindia Tower]], [[Târgovişte]], [[Romania]]]]
{{See also|Watchtower}}
[[Tower]]s of medieval [[castle]]s were usually made of stone or sometimes (but rarely) wood. Often toward the later part of the era they included battlements and arrow loops. Arrow loops were vertical slits in the wall through which archers inside shot arrows at the attackers, but made it extremely difficult for attackers to get many arrows back through at the defenders.

===City walls===
{{Main|Defensive wall}}


[[File:Remains of Kommendemauer Burgsteinfurt.jpg|thumb|200px|Remains of a commandry (Order of Knights of St. John of Jerusalem) wall in [[Steinfurt]], Germany. The downward slope on the outer side is hidden behind a fence and shrubbery]]
An exact nature of the walls of a medieval town or city would depend on the resources available for building them, the nature of the terrain, and the perceived threat. In northern [[Europe]], early in the period, walls were likely to have been constructed of wood and proofed against small forces. Especially where stone was readily available for building, the wood will have been replaced by stone to a higher or lower standard of security. This would have been the pattern of events in the [[Five Burghs|Five Boroughs]] of the [[Danelaw]] in [[England]].

In many cases, the wall would have had an internal and an external ''[[pomoerium]]''. This was a strip of clear ground immediately adjacent the wall. The word is from the late [[medieval]], derived from the classical [[Latin]] ''post murum'' ("behind the wall").

An external pomoerium, stripped of bushes and building, gave defenders a clear view of what was happening outside and an unobstructed field of shot. An internal pomoerium gave ready access to the rear of the [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] to facilitate movement of the [[garrison]] to a point of need. By the end of the sixteenth century, the word had developed further in common use, into ''pomery''.

[[File:Forteresse de Dubrovnik.jpg|left|thumb|235px|[[Walls of Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]]]]
Also by that time, the medieval walls were no longer secure against a serious threat from an army, as they were not designed to be strong enough to resist cannon fire. They were sometimes rebuilt, as at [[Berwick on Tweed]], or retained for use against thieves and other threats of a lower order. Very elaborate and complex schemes for town defences were developed in the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]], but these belong mainly to the post-medieval periods. By 1600, the medieval wall is likely to have been seen more as a platform for displaying hangings and the pomery as a gathering ground for spectators, or as a source of building stone and a site for its use, respectively. However, a few, such as those of [[Carcassonne]] and [[Dubrovnik]], survived fairly well and have been restored to a nearly complete state.

Medieval walls that were no longer adequate for defending were succeeded by the [[star fort]]. After the invention of the [[explosive shell]], star forts became obsolete as well.

===Harbours===
[[Image:Fn braun-varadinum.jpg|thumb|right|Fortifications of Várad (now [[Oradea]]/Nagyvárad, [[Romania]]) in a 1617 print]]
[[Harbour]]s or some sort of water access was often essential to the construction of medieval fortification. It was a direct route for trading and fortification. Having direct access to a body of water provided a route for resupply in times of war, an additional method of transportation in times of peace, and potential drinking water for a [[besiege]]d castle or fortification. The concept of rivers or harbours coming directly up to the walls of fortifications was especially used by the English as they constructed castles throughout [[Wales]].
There is evidence that harbours were fortified, with wooden structures in the water creating a semi-circle around the harbour, or jetties, as seen in an artists reconstruction of Hedeby, in Denmark, with an opening for ships to access the land. Usually, these wooden structures would have small bases at either end, creating a 'watch' and defense platform.

===Churches and monasteries===
{{main|Castle chapel}}
[[Religion]] was a central part of the lives of medieval soldiers, and [[Church (building)|churches]], [[chapel]]s, [[monastery|monasteries]], and other buildings of religious function were often included within the walls of any fortification, be it temporary or permanent. A place to conduct religious services was usually essential to the morale of the soldiers.

===Mottes and baileys===
{{Main|Motte-and-bailey}}
Motte-and-bailey was the prevalent form of castle during 11th and 12th centuries. A courtyard (called a bailey) was protected by a ditch and a palisade (strong timber fence). Often the entrance was protected by a lifting bridge, a [[drawbridge]] or a timber gate tower. Inside the bailey were stables, workshops, and a chapel.

The motte was the final refuge in this type of castle. It was a raised earth mound, and varied considerably, with these mounds being 3 metres to 30 metres in height (10 feet to 100 feet), and from {{convert|30|to|90|m|ft}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Toy, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a tower on top of the motte. In most cases, the tower was made of timber, though some were also made of stones. Stone towers were found in natural mounds, as artificial ones were not strong enough to support stone towers. Larger mottes had towers with many rooms, including the great hall. Smaller ones had only a watch tower.

==Construction==
[[File:Mehrangarh Fort, Jodhpur. 1981.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Mehrangarh Fort]], Jodhpur, which was built between the 15th and 17th centuries]]
Construction could sometimes take decades. The string of Welsh castles [[Edward I of England]] had built were an exception in that he focused much of the resources of his kingdom on their speedy construction. In addition to paid workers, forced levies of labourers put thousands of men on each site and shortened construction to a few years.

===Location===
[[image:El Castillo de Predjama.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Predjama Castle was built next to the cave]]
Nature could provide very effective natural defense for the castle. For this reason many castles were built on larger hills, cliffs, close to rivers, lakes or even caves.

===Materials===
Materials that were used in the building of castles varied through history. Wood was used for most castles until 1066. They were cheap and were quick to construct. The reason wood fell into disuse as a material is that it is quite flammable. Soon stone became more popular.

Stone castles took years to construct depending on the overall size of the castle. Stone was stronger and of course much more expensive than wood. Most stone had to be quarried miles away, and then brought to the building site. But with the invention of the cannon and gunpowder, castles soon lost their power.

===Costs===
[[File:Battlement (PSF).jpg|right|thumb|200px|Drawing of battlements on a tower]]
Costs for the walls depended on the material used. Wood would cost very little and was quick to build, but was weak. Stone was strong but very expensive and time-consuming to construct.

===Manpower===
Manpower in the medieval era in Europe consisted mainly of serfs.

===Walls===


[[Image:GradSneznik2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Snežnik Castle protected by defensive wall in southern Slovenia]]

The height of walls varied widely by castle, but were often {{convert|2.5|–|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick. They were usually topped with [[crenellation]] or [[parapet]]s that offered protection to defenders. Some also featured [[machicolation]]s (from the French ''machicoulis'', approximately "neck-crusher") which consisted of openings between a wall and a parapet, formed by [[corbel]]ling out the latter, allowing defenders to throw stones, boiling water, and so forth, upon assailants below. Some castles featured additional inner walls, as additional [[fortification]]s from which to mount a defense if outer walls were breached.

===Gates===
{{See also|City gate|Barbican}}
[[Image:105 0508ConventoDeCristo2.jpg|thumb|Gate of [[Tomar]] Castle, [[Portugal]]]]
Any entrance through a wall, being an opening, forms an obvious weak point. To be practical, the entryway would have to accommodate supplies being brought through, yet difficult for attackers to breach. For example, passage over ditches or moats would have to be withdrawn to deny attackers. The use of multiple walls or ditches around an entrance would also make it difficult for defenders to use the entrance practically, necessitating better methods of control. Gates came in many forms, from the simple stone buttress and timber blocks,&lt;ref name="Stoning and Fire at hill fort entrances of southern Britain"&gt;{{cite book|author=Avery, Michael|title=World Archeology|volume=Vol. 18, No. 2|date=October 1986|pages=216–230}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the massive and imposing stone archways and thick wooden doors most associated with medieval citadels.

===Killing fields===
A killing field was an area between the main wall and a secondary wall, so when the first wall was breached the attackers would run into the killing field to be confronted by another wall from which soldiers bombarded them. Soldiers would be positioned atop the second wall and armed with any variety of weapons, ranging from bows to crossbows to simple rocks.

===Moats===
{{Main|Moat}}
A moat was a common addition to medieval fortifications, and the principal purpose was to simply increase the effective height of the walls and to prevent digging under the walls. In many instances, natural water paths were used as moats, and often extended through ditches to surround as much of the fortification as possible. Provided this was not so unnaturally contrived as to allow an attacker to drain the system, it served two defensive purposes. It made approaching the curtain wall of the castle more difficult and the undermining of the wall virtually impossible. To position a castle on a small island was very favorable from a defensive point of view, although it made deliveries of supplies and building materials more cumbersome and expensive.

===Keeps===
{{Main|Keep}}
A keep is a strong central tower which normally forms the heart of a castle. Often the keep is the most defended area of a castle, and as such may form the main habitation area for a noble or lord, or contain important stores such as the armoury or the main well.

===Stairs===
[[File:Stumble steps.jpg|alt=Stumble steps at Maynooth Castle|thumb|Stumble steps at [[Maynooth Castle]], Ireland. Note the canting, and the varied tread depth and riser height.]]
Stairs were also constructed to contain trick or stumble steps. These were steps that had different rise height or tread depth from the rest and would cause anyone running up the stairs to stumble or fall, so slowing down the attackers' progress.

===Doors===
[[Image:Horezu oak Reinforced door.JPG|thumb|right|Reinforced wood door]]
A typical exterior wooden [[door]] might be made out of two layers of [[oak]] planks. The grain of the wood would run vertically on the front layer and horizontally on the back, like a simple form of [[plywood]]. The two layers would be held together by iron studs, and the structure might be strengthened and stiffened with iron bands.

The studs themselves were pointed on the front so that attackers would damage their weapons ([[sword]]s, [[axe]]s, etc.) while trying to break through.

==Transition to modern fortification==
From the mid-15th century onwards, the power of cannons grew and medieval walls became obsolete as they were too thin to offer any realistic protection against prolonged [[bomb]]ardment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pañeda Ruiz|first1=José Manuel|title=Evolution of siege techniques: From the Catholic Monarchs to Vauban|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/images/stories/docs/evolution_of_siege_techniques.pdf|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=22 October 2015|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of this, medieval walls were often upgraded with the addition of artillery platforms or bastions, and battlements were replaced by thick parapets with [[embrasure]]s. In many cases, the medieval walls were dismantled and their stonework, which was still valuable as construction material, was reused in the construction of the new fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=A ''Cubete Artillero'' at Mdina? – Gunpowder fortifications in Late Medieval Malta|journal=Proceedings of History Week|date=2009|pages=150–159|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Proceedings%20of%20History%20Week/PHW2009/10s.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414181507/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Proceedings%20of%20History%20Week/PHW2009/10s.pdf |archivedate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting space is often seen in old city centers of Europe even to this day, as broader streets often outline where the old wall once stood (evident for example in [[Prague]] and [[Florence, Italy]]).

The transition between medieval and early modern fortification can be seen in the [[fortifications of Rhodes]] in Greece and the [[fortifications of Famagusta]] in Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Walsh|editor1-first=Michael J. K.|editor2-last=Coureas|editor2-first=Nicholas|editor3-last=Edbury|editor3-first=Peter W.|title=Medieval and Renaissance Famagusta: Studies in Architecture, Art and History|date=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|isbn=9781409435570|page=191|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=6NnDOZeKR80C&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defensive obstacles==
Just as modern military [[combat engineer|engineers]] enhance field fortifications with obstacles such as [[wire obstacle|barbed wire]], medieval engineers used a number of obstacle types including [[abatis]], [[caltrop]]s, [[cheval de frise]], and [[trou de loup]].

''Mother!'' was selected to compete for the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[74th Venice International Film Festival]], and premiered there on September 5, 2017.&lt;ref name="Venice"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tartaglione|first1=Nancy|title=Venice Film Festival Sets Lido Launch For Aronofsky, Clooney, Del Toro, Payne &amp; More As Awards Buzz Begins&amp;nbsp;– Full List|url=http://deadline.com/2017/07/venice-film-festival-2017-lineup-full-list-1202137114/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|accessdate=July 27, 2017|date=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in the United States on September 15, 2017, by [[Paramount Pictures]], and grossed $44 million worldwide against its $30 million budget.

==Plot== 
In the burnt-out remains of a large house, Him, an acclaimed poet struggling with writer's block, places a crystal object on a pedestal in his study. The ruined house morphs into a lovely home in an edenic landscape. In bed, Mother, the poet's wife and muse, awakens and wonders aloud where Him is. While renovating the house, she starts seeing things that unsettle her, including visualizing a beating heart within its walls.

One day, Man turns up at the house, asking for a room. Him readily agrees, and Mother reluctantly follows suit. During his stay, Man suffers coughing fits and Mother observes an open wound in his side. Soon Man's wife, Woman, also arrives to stay. Mother is increasingly frustrated with her guests, but Him begs her to let them stay, telling Mother they are fans of his work and Man is dying. However, when Man and Woman accidentally shatter the crystal object, which Him had forbidden them to touch, Mother kicks them out and Him boards up his study.

Before Man and Woman can leave, their two sons arrive and fight over their father's will. The Oldest Son, who will be left with nothing, severely wounds his Younger Brother and flees. Him, Man, and Woman take the injured son for help. Alone in the house, Mother follows a trail of blood to find a tank of heating oil hidden behind the basement walls.

Upon returning, Him informs Mother the son has died. Dozens of people arrive at the house to honor the dead son. They behave in rude and presumptuous ways that irritate Mother; she snaps when they break a sink, flooding the house. She orders everyone out and berates Him for allowing so many people inside while ignoring her needs. Their argument ends in passionate lovemaking.

The next morning, Mother announces she is pregnant. The news elates Him and inspires him to finish his work. Mother prepares for the arrival of their child and reads Him's beautiful new poem. Upon publication, it immediately sells out every copy. In celebration, Mother prepares a big dinner, but a group of fans arrives at the house before they can eat. She asks Him to send them away, but he insists he has to be polite and will return soon. Mother tries to lock the doors, but more fans arrive and enter the house to use the toilet. They start stealing things as souvenirs and damaging the house, but Him is oblivious due to the adulation he is receiving. Hundreds of people fill the house and an increasingly disoriented Mother watches it devolve into chaos. Military forces battle a cult of frenzied fans who tear rooms apart and engage in religious rituals. Amidst gunfire and explosions, the Herald, the poet's publicist, organizes mass executions.

Mother goes into labor and finds Him. He takes her to his study, which he reopens so she can give birth there. The havoc outside subsides. Him tells Mother his fans want to see their newborn son; she refuses and holds her son tightly. When she falls asleep, however, Him takes their child outside to the crowd, which passes the baby around wildly until his neck is inadvertently snapped. Mother wades into the crowd where she sees people eating her son's mutilated corpse. Furious, she calls them murderers and stabs them with a shard of glass. They turn on her, viciously beating and attempting to strangle her until Him intervenes. He implores Mother to forgive them, but she escapes, makes her way to the basement oil tank, and punctures it with a pipe wrench. Despite her husband's pleas, she sets the oil alight; it explodes, destroying the crowd, the house, and the surrounding environment.

Mother and Him survive; she is horrifically burned while Him is completely unscathed. He asks for her love and she agrees. He tears open her chest and removes her heart. As he crushes the heart with his hands, a new crystal object is revealed. He places it on its pedestal and, once again, the house is transformed from a burnt-out shell into a beautiful home. In bed, a new Mother appears and wakes up, wondering aloud where Him is.

[[File:Upper Rhenish Master - The Garden of Eden (detail) - WGA23764.jpg|thumb|Detail from ''[[Paradiesgärtlein]]'' (''Little Garden of Paradise''), by an unknown artist active {{Circa|1410–20}}, possibly in [[Strasbourg]]. [[Jennifer Lawrence]] has said the film's setting sometimes resembles the [[Garden of Eden]], which this work depicts.]]

In an interview, Lawrence said that the film is an allegory; she said that the film "depicts the rape and torment of [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]] ... I represent Mother Earth; Javier, whose character is a poet, represents a form of [[God]], a creator; Michelle Pfeiffer is an [[Eve]] to Ed Harris's [[Adam]], there's [[Cain and Abel]] and the setting sometimes resembles the [[Garden of Eden]]".&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/mother-meaning-spoilers-biblical-references-ending-explained/|title=Mother! explained: what does it all mean, and what on earth is that yellow potion?|last=White|first=Adam|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=September 16, 2017|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aronofsky said that the exclamation mark in the title "reflects the spirit of the film" and corresponds to an "exclamation point" of the ending. The director discussed the film's unusual capitalisation in a [[/r/IAmA|Reddit interview]], saying, "To find out why there's a lowercase 'm', read the credits and look for the letter that isn't capitalised. Ask yourself what's another name for this character?" The characters' names are all shown in lowercase, except for Him.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

The lighter which appears throughout the film bears the [[Wendehorn]], a symbol believed to represent "the cooperation between nature's eternal laws, working in effect and in accordance with each other." One of the film's unexplained elements is the yellow powder Lawrence's character drinks, which ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' suggests is a reference to [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s short story "[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]".&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

==Production==
After 2014's ''[[Noah (2014 film)|Noah]]'', Aronofsky began working on a children's film. During that process, he came up with a new idea. He ended up writing the ''Mother!'' screenplay in five days, much faster than his usual pace.&lt;ref name="Fallpreview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/08/darren-aronofsky-mother.html |title=Darren Aronofsky Doesn’t Want You to Know Anything About Mother! |last=Riseman |first=Abraham |website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]] |publisher=New York Media |access-date=September 7, 2017 |date=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film uses a dream-logic narrative, of which Aronofsky has noted, "if you try to unscrew it, it kind of falls apart," and that "it's a psychological freak-out. You shouldn't over-explain it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooks|first1=Xan|title=Darren Aronofsky on Mother! - ‘Jennifer Lawrence was hyperventilating because of the emotion’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/07/darren-aronofsky-on-mother-jennifer-lawrence-was-hyperventilating-because-of-the-emotion|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|date=September 7, 2017|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Lawrence was relatively laid-back, and Aronofsky has said that as a result he "didn't get to know the character until we started shooting, and she showed up."&lt;ref name="Fallpreview" /&gt;

''Mother!'' is the first Aronofsky film without composer [[Clint Mansell]]'s involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cabin |first1=Chris |title=Darren Aronofsky Teases Details of His New, Enigmatic Drama; Won't Be Collaborating with Clint Mansell |url= http://collider.com/darren-aronofsky-new-movie-jennifer-lawrence/ |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|ComplexMedia]] |accessdate=October 28, 2016 |date=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film originally had a score composed by [[Jóhann Jóhannsson]], but after seeing the 90-minute score synced up with a rough cut of the film, Aronofsky and Jóhannsson agreed not to use the original score. They experimented with using the score at only a few moments, or instead using a new minimal score focused on [[sound design]] that incorporated noises into the soundscape of the house. Ultimately, they went with the second choice, and Jóhannsson's work merged with the sound design of Craig Henighan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/mother-movie-jennifer-lawrence-darren-aronofsky-score-johann-johannsson|title=Inside the Dreamy Nightmare of Mother!’s Music-Free Soundscape|first=Greg|last=Noone|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=May 7, 2018|date=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composer [[Ólafur Arnalds]] recounted the following story about the decision:

He proceeded to convince Darren to delete everything. It takes a real, selfless artist to do that. To realise the piece is better without you. 
The most important part of creating art is the process, and Jóhann seemed to understand process. The score needed to be written first in order to realise that it was redundant. So in my view, ''Mother!'' still has a score by Jóhann. The score is just silence... deafening, genius silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BfDwiTfF0bd/|first=Ólafur |last=Arnalds |title=My favorite Jóhann story is when he had spent a year writing the score for Darren Aronofsky's "Mother" and at some point realised that the…|publisher=[[Instagram]]|date=February 11, 2018|accessdate=May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
''Mother!'' grossed $17.8 million in the United States and Canada and $26.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $44.5 million, against a production budget of $30 million.&lt;ref name="BOM" /&gt;

In North America, the film was released alongside ''[[American Assassin]]'' and was projected to gross $12–14 million from 2,368 theaters in its opening weekend.&lt;ref name=preview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/can-american-assassin-or-mother-poke-a-hole-in-it-box-office-balloon/|title=Can ‘Mother!’ or ‘American Assassin’ Poke a Hole in ‘It’ Box Office Balloon?|website=[[TheWrap]]|last=Fuster|first=Jeremy|accessdate=May 7, 2018|date=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It made $700,000 from Thursday night previews and $3.1 million on its first day.

Aronofsky responded to the film's CinemaScore rating by saying that it was meant to be difficult viewing for audiences: "How if you walk out of this movie are you not going to give it an 'F'? … We wanted to make a punk movie and come at you.

He also referred to the film and its script as "grandiose and narcissistic and, in quick strokes, pretty vicious," while drawing a similarity to Aronofsky's film, ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-mother-review-0913-story.html|title= 'Mother!' review: Trouble in paradise, starring Jennifer Lawrence|first=Michael |last=Phillips|date=September 13, 2017|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Peter Bradshaw]] gave the film 5 stars, saying, "Darren Aronofsky’s toweringly outrageous film leaves no gob unsmacked.

The horror, the dark comedy, the biblical elements, the cautionary fable — they're all there, but they're elements in the total experience, which engulfs the characters and the viewers along with them. Only a true, passionate filmmaker could have made this picture, which I'm still experiencing weeks after I saw it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Martin | last=Scorsese | title=Martin Scorsese on Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Obsession and Why 'Mother!'

[[Rex Reed]] gave the film zero stars in ''[[The New York Observer]]'', and wrote that despite some good cinematography, "Nothing about ''Mother!'' makes one lick of sense as Darren Aronofsky's corny vision of madness turns more hilarious than scary. With so much crap around to clog the drain, I hesitate to label it the 'Worst movie of the year' when 'Worst movie of the century' fits it even better." Reed further dismissed other critics' positive reviews of the film as "equally pretentious" and "even nuttier than the film itself. ... they all insist ''Mother!'' is a metaphor for something, although they are not quite sure what it is."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Rex|last=Reed|authorlink=Rex Reed|url=http://observer.com/2017/09/darren-aronofsky-mother-worst-movie-of-the-year/|title=‘Mother!’ Is the Worst Movie of the Year, Maybe Century|date=September 15, 2017|work=[[New York Observer]]|publisher=[[Observer Media]]|location=New York City|access-date=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''[[The New Republic]]''’s Josephine Livingstone states that the film has "no human center to hold it down."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/144917/aronofskys-mother-mess-biblical-proportions|title=Aronofsky’s ''Mother!'' is a Mess of Biblical Proportions|work=[[The New Republic]]|first=Josephine |last=Livingstone|date=September 20, 2017|accessdate=May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Lane]] in his ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' review wrote, "My patience was tested beyond repair, I am afraid, by the nimbus of nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/25/mother-and-battle-of-the-sexes|title="Mother!" and "Battle of the Sexes"|work=[[The New Yorker]]|publisher=NYP Holdings|accessdate=May 7, 2018|first=Anthony |last=Lane|date=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' review, John Anderson said, "it achieves a level of excess that makes the whole enterprise increasingly cartoonish, rather than just awful."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/mother-review-giving-birth-to-madness-1505407913|title=‘Mother!’ Review: Giving Birth to Madness|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|accessdate=May 7, 2018|first=John |last=Anderson|date=September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''{{'}} [[Richard Roeper]] rated the film 2 out of 4 stars, writing that while he appreciated Lawrence's performance, he questioned whether Aronofsky was mocking certain biblical passages featured in the film or presenting a commentary on an artistic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/o-mother-what-art-thou-odd-jennifer-lawrence-film-pounds-senses/|title=O ‘mother!,’ what art thou?

Stephen Whitty of the ''[[Newark Star Ledger]]'' wrote, "one part early [[Roman Polanski]], one part pseudo [[Harold Pinter]], and two parts apology-from-a-driven-artist. And none of it adds up. The feeble idea behind "Mother!" isn't strong enough to bear the weight of all the overwrought style he hangs on it. Unlike the mansion it's set in, it's a small, hammered-together thing, and it can't bear all this meaning and metaphor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/09/mother_review_jennifer_lawrence_is_baby-crazy.html|title='Mother!' review: Jennifer Lawrence is baby-crazy|work=[[Newark Star Ledger]]|first=Stephen |last=Whitty |publisher=[[NJ.com]]|date=September 16, 2017 |accessdate=May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Nashawaty of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said "Darren Aronofsky’s Mother! is [[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary’s Baby]] amped up into a [[fugue state]] of self-indulgent [[solipsism]].

Hussain learned basic cooking skills at school;&lt;ref name=sundaytimes-nadiyas-kitchen/&gt; her mother never baked and used the oven for storage. She taught herself the rest from recipe books and watching videos on YouTube. Her favourite book is a baking-themed book by Irish novelist [[Marian Keyes]].&lt;ref name=Times-Next-2015 /&gt;

At the time of ''The Great British Bake Off'', Hussain was a [[housewife]] living in [[Leeds]] with her husband, an IT specialist, and three children, while studying for an [[Open University]] degree in Childhood and Youth Studies.&lt;ref name=RadioTimes-interview-2015&gt;{{cite web |last1=Millard |first1=Rosie |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-07/bake-offs-nadiya-on-her-baking-inspiration-coping-with-fame-and-why-her-headscarf-doesnt-stop-her-loving-tea-and-bunting |title=''Bake Off''{{'}}s Nadiya on her baking inspiration, coping with fame and why her headscarf doesn't stop her loving tea and bunting |date=7 October 2015 |work=[[Radio Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When she won the final they moved to [[Milton Keynes]], near London, so that she could pursue a culinary career.&lt;ref name=Times-Next-2015 /&gt;

In 2015, Hussain appeared in and won the [[The Great British Bake Off (series 6)|sixth series]] of ''[[The Great British Bake Off]]''.

During her acceptance speech, she said: {{quote|I'm never gonna put boundaries on myself ever again. I'm never gonna say I can't do it. I'm never gonna say 'maybe'.

Hussain established a large following on social media thanks to her stunning show-stoppers and her illuminating facial expressions, her online followers describe themselves as "Nadiyators" and also won backing of then Prime Minister [[David Cameron]].&lt;ref name=independent-cameron-fan&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/great-british-bake-off-david-cameron-reveals-he-wants-nadiya-to-win-final-a6680026.html|title=Great British Bake Off: David Cameron reveals he wants Nadiya to win final|author=Jane Merrick|work=[[The Independent]]|date= 5 October 2015|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Nirgul tablet''' (also known as '''The Kerberos Relief''' or '''The Relief Image of Hades''') is an ancient [[Parthia]]n [[relief carving]] of the deity [[Nergal]] found in the city of [[Hatra]] in [[Iraq]], dating to the first or second century AD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drijvers|first1=H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6418">[[File:On Frankenstein Athenaeum 1832.jpg|thumb|"On ''Frankenstein''" in ''The Athenaeum'', London, November 10, 1832.]]"'''On ''Frankenstein'''''" is a review of the 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]'' written by Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1817 but not published until 1832.
==Background==
The review was written by Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1817 to help promote the novel and to counter expected negative reviews. It remained unpublished, however, until after the third edition of ''Frankenstein'' appeared in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;[http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/PShelley/frankrev.html "On Frankenstein''."]&lt;/ref&gt; Percy Bysshe Shelley's cousin [[Thomas Medwin]] submitted it to the British literary magazine ''[[The Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' for the Saturday, November 10, 1832 issue on page 730.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Charles E., ed. ''The Original Frankenstein'' by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (with Percy Bysshe Shelley). New York: Vintage Books, 2008, pp. 434-36.&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of the series "The Shelley Papers" which appeared in ''The Athenaeum'' starting in September, 1832. 

In his biography ''Life of Shelley'', Medwin had written that he sought to have the review published to demonstrate that, contrary to claims, Shelley did not write the novel and did not have any role in its creation: "I have heard it asserted that the idea [of ''Frankenstein''] was [Percy Bysshe] Shelley's, and that he assisted much in the development of the plot." Notwithstanding Medwin's own claims, the drafts and proofs of the novel showed that this statement was accurate. Shelley had come up with the idea for the novel, as Mary herself acknowledged in the 1831 Introduction, and he had, at the very least, made substantial contributions to the writing of the novel. Mary had not, however, included the review in her compilations and publications of Shelley's prose works. [[John Lauritsen]] in ''[[The Man Who Wrote Frankenstein]]'' argued that Mary suppressed the review because she feared it would expose Shelley as the true author of the novel.

The review was republished in Thomas Medwin's ''Memoir of Percy Bysshe Shelley; and Original Poems and Papers by Percy Bysshe Shelley: Now First Collected'' in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Medwin, Thomas. ''Memoir of Percy Bysshe Shelley; and Original Poems and Papers by Percy Bysshe Shelley: Now First Collected''. London: Whittaker, Treacher, &amp; Co., 1833, pp. 165-70.&lt;/ref&gt; The review also appeared in ''The Prose Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley'' edited by E. B. Murray in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, E. B., ed. ''The Prose Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993, I, 282-4, together with commentary and collations on pp. 489-92, 553, and 565.&lt;/ref&gt;

The review was republished in ''[[The Man Who Wrote Frankenstein]]'' by John Lauritsin in 2007 and ''The Original Frankenstein'' edited by Charles E. Robinson in 2008.

==Summary==

Shelley wrote that the dialogues between the Being and De Lacey were the most powerful and moving in the novel. He wrote that the central moral of the novel is intolerance, describing innocent victims of prejudice in society, "who are best qualified to be its benefactors and its ornaments." Shelley argued that the Being was a product of a xenophobic society: "Treat a person ill, and he will become wicked."

Shelley referred to the monster as the "Being" five times in his review. He also referred to the anonymous author using a masculine pronoun, "he".

The British Library analysis noted the direct connection to Shelley's poem "[[Mont Blanc (poem)|Mont Blanc]]" which was published in 1817 in ''[[History of a Six Weeks' Tour]]''. ''Frankenstein'' develops the theme of "necessity" which Shelley wrote about in that poem. It is a philosophical idea of the novel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/review-of-frankenstein-from-the-athenaeum Review of ''Frankenstein'' from ''The Athenaeum''. The British Library. Retrieved 19 July, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The review related ''Frankenstein'' to Percy Bysshe Shelley's own works: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The environment is an aspect Shelley also emphasises in his preface to the 1818 edition. He examines the way the monster turns against the world as a direct result of his treatment. For Shelley this is an example of the philosophical idea he defined as necessity, 'an immense and uninterrupted chain of causes and effects', which is explored in 'Mont Blanc' and is 'the direct moral' of ''Frankenstein''. He points out that the monster’s mind is formed by impressions, and thus a conflict is created between Frankenstein monster’s good intentions (moments at which he is 'affectionate and full of moral sensibility') and the reactions of those around him to his 'tremendous' (frightening) appearance."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/review-of-frankenstein-from-the-athenaeum Review of ''Frankenstein'' from ''The Athenaeum''. The British Library. Retrieved 19 July, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shelley concluded that the novel was "one of the most original and complete productions of the age."

The '''''Perugia Altarpiece''''' (Italian: ''Pala di Perugia'') is a painting   by the Italian early Renaissance painter   [[Fra Angelico]], housed in the [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]] of [[Perugia]], Italy. 

==History==
The painting was executed for the St. Nicholas Chapel in the [[Basilica of San Domenico, Perugia]]. In the early 19th century, it was split and partially dispersed, and some of the predella panels were acquired by the [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]]. In Perugia were executed copies of these panels, enclosed into a neo-Gothic frame. The [[polyptych]] also included some small depictions of saints, on the side piers, and two [[Tondo (art)|tondoes]] with the ''Annunciation Angel'' and the ''Annunciation'', in the cusps.

[[File:The Perugia Altarpiece, Side Panel Depicting St. Dominic.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Side panel depicting St. Dominic, by Fra Angelico]]

==Description==

The work includes a large central panel, depicting the ''Madonna Enthroned with Child and Angels'', which was fully painted by Fra Angelico. The two side panels, each forming  two arched sub-panels and including a figure of saint.  On the left are [[St. Dominic]] and [[St. Nicholas of Bari|St. Nicholas]], attributed to Angelico, while on the right are [[St. John the Baptist]] and [[St. Catherine of Alexandria]], considered mostly by his workshop. 

The central Madonna is a ''[[Maestà]]'' depiction, and sits on  a large throne painted using [[geometric perspective]]. In front of her is a step with vases housing three white and red roses (symbolizing of the Virgin's purity and a forecast of Christ's Passion, respectively). The panel resembles strictly  that in the [[Cortona Triptych]], especially for the Madonna, the throne's arch and the placement of the angels. The pavement is decorated with marble tarsia, already used by Fra Angelico in earlier works such as the [[San Pietro Martire Triptych]] (1428-1429).

The saint's figures are less monumental than in the later [[Tabernacle of the Lanaioli]] (1433-1435). Behind them is a table, covered by a brocade drape decorated in gold, over which is St. Nicholas' [[mitre]].

The predella panels portray scenes of the ''Life of St. Nicholas''

The '''Pincum relief''' is a [[funerary art]] fragment of an early 2nd century AD Roman marble relief depicting [[Achilles]] and [[Hector]] of the [[Trojan War|Trojan cycle]] of [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]]. It is unique in the way that it's the only [[stelae]] depicting this myth found in Upper Moesia.&lt;ref name="BI1"&gt;[http://www.balkaninstitut.com/pdf/izdanja/B_XXXVII_2007.pdf Heroic Themes of the Trojan Cycle in Roman Funerary Art]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BI2&gt;http://www.balkaninstitut.com/pdf/izdanja/balcanica/Balcanica%20XXXVII%20(2006).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The relief was found in [[Veliko Gradište]], [[Serbia]] (Roman ''[[Pincum]]'', [[Upper Moesia]]) at the estate of Kosta Marković.&lt;ref name="BI1"/&gt;

It is made of white coarse-grained marble and depicts Achilles standing with the dead body of Hector, a myth which is seen on numerous Attica [[sarcophagi]]. Artistic analogies are a relief from [[Maria Saal]] (''Virunum'', [[Noricum]]) and two images from [[Dunaújváros]] (''Intercisa'', [[Pannonia]]).&lt;ref name="BI1"/&gt;

'''René Wellek''' (August 22, 1903 – November 11, 1995) was a [[Czech Republic|Czech]]-[[United States|American]] [[comparative literature|comparative]] [[literary critic]]. Like [[Erich Auerbach]], Wellek was an eminent product of the Central European [[philology|philological]] tradition and was known as a vastly erudite and "fair-minded critic of critics."&lt;ref name="RobertMcG" /&gt;

René Wellek was born and raised in [[Vienna]], speaking [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[German language|German]]. He studied literature at the [[Charles University]] in Prague, and was active among the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague School]] linguists there, before moving to teach at [[School of Slavonic and East European Studies]] (now part of [[University College London]]) in 1935. His younger brother [[Albert Wellek]] (1904-1972) was one of the founders of musical psychology and lived in Germany. Before 1939, Wellek published some 60 items, all written in Czech.&lt;ref&gt;Wellek, René. ''Concepts of Criticism'' ed. S. G. Nichols, Jr. New Haven and London: Yale UP, 1963, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1939, the beginning of [[World War II]] in Europe, Wellek lived in America.&lt;ref name="RobertMcG" /&gt; He taught first at the [[University of Iowa]] for seven years until 1946, and then, beginning in that year, at [[Yale University]], where he established and chaired a department of comparative literature. In the United States, he was "widely regarded as a founder of the study of [[comparative literature]]."&lt;ref name="RobertMcG" /&gt;  With [[Austin Warren]], Wellek published a landmark volume entitled ''[[Theory of Literature]]'', one of the first works to systematize [[literary theory]].

Beginning in the 1960s, Wellek defended the [[New Critics]] against the condemnation of their work in the name of a [[Semiotic literary criticism|structuralist]]-influenced literary theory, and is thus sometimes classed as a conservative critic. Wellek advocated a synthesized approach to literary criticism, one that included 1) literary theory, 2) a careful study of previous works of criticism, and 3) a thorough understanding of the surrounding history involved in an author's creation of a work, including the author's personal history and milieu. Any approach elevating one of these aspects above the other would be in error.&lt;ref&gt;Wellek, René. ''Concepts of Criticism'' ed. S. G. Nichols, Jr. New Haven and London: Yale UP, 1963, p. 2 and p. 20. Reprint of "Literary Theory, Criticism, and History," ''English Studies Today,'' 2nd ser., ed. G. A. Bonnard (Bern, Francke Verlag, 1961) pp. 53-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Wellek said the best literary critic must "do what every scientist and scholar does: to isolate his object, in our case, the literary work of art, to contemplate it intently, to analyze, to interpret, and finally to evaluate it by criteria derived from, verified by, buttressed by, as wide a knowledge, as close an observation, as keen a sensibility, as honest a judgment as we can command."&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''. p 17.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wellek, bringing all of literary theory, criticism, and history into consideration allows a critic to achieve "victory over impermanence, relativity, and history."&lt;ref&gt;''ibid'' p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crowning work of Wellek's career was an eight-volume ''magnum opus'' entitled ''A History of Modern Criticism: 1750-1950'', the last two volumes of which he dictated from his bed in a nursing home at age 90.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/16/arts/rene-wellek-92-a-professor-of-comparative-literature-dies.html Wellek obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shindana Toys''', a division of [[Operation Bootstrap, Inc.]], was a [[South Central Los Angeles]], California cooperative [[toy]] [[cooperative|company]] in busienss from 1968 to 1983.&lt;ref name="bdc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blackdollcollecting.blogspot.com/2012/08/baby-nancy-shindanas-first-doll.html |title=Baby Nancy ~ Shindana's First Doll |last=Behan Garrett |first=Debbie |date=August 8, 2012 |publisher=Black Doll Collecting |accessdate=August 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an Operation Bootstrap initiatives undertaken following the 1965 [[Watts Riots]]. Company proceeds supported businesses in the Watts area. Shindana (a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word roughly meaning "to compete") Toys was community-owned and founded by [[Louis S. Smith, II]] and [[Robert Hall (activist)|Robert Hall]]. The latter was the company's first CEO and President; though he was succeeded in both posts by Smith. The [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], the [[Mattel Toy Company]], [[Sears Roebuck &amp; Co.]], and [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life Assurance]] helped finance portions of the Shindana Toys operations.

Shindana Toys was historically significant for being one of the first toy companies (if not the first) to market ethnically-correct{{clarify|date=June 2015}} [[black dolls]]. A goal of the company was to raise Black consciousness and improve self-image. In a 1970s Los Angeles Associated Press article, company president, Louis Smith said, "We believe that only by learning to love oneself can one learn to love others...Shindana believes that by marketing black dolls and games that both black and white children can learn to relate to at an early age, the company can foster the spirit of what Shindana is all about, love."

From a shop on Vermont Avenue, Los Angeles, California, [[Doris Conner]]—an African American, entrepreneurial businesswoman—along with her daughters, Lynne and Tuesday Conner, created, designed, and manufactured many of the clothes worn by Shindana Dolls. They also manufactured the Flip Wilson doll.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:ShindanaToysTamu.jpg|right]] --&gt;
While the first doll created by Shindana Toys was named "Baby Nancy,"&lt;ref name="bdc"/&gt; many later Shindana Toys dolls featured ethnically correct names, including names that were Swahili in origin. Operation Bootstrap contracted with Mattel Toymakers to create a talking voice unit, just like the one invented for [[Chatty Cathy]] in 1960, for their doll Tamu in 1971. The popular Talking Tamu (Swahili for "sweet") doll was designed to say the following 11 phrases when you pulled her "talking ring":

* My name is Tamu.
* Cool it, baby.
* Do you like my dress?
* Hold me tight.
* I'm sleepy.
* Can you dig it?
* Let's play house.
* I love you.
* Tamu means 'sweet'.
* I'm hungry.
* I'm proud, like you.

Tamu was featured in the Sears Roebuck, JC Penney, and Montgomery Wards Christmas catalogs, and available in most stores where ever toys were sold.

== Popular Shindana Doll Lines ==
;Black Celebrity Dolls
Shindana dolls were created with the likenesses of positive Black celebrities, including [[Flip Wilson]], [[Jimmie Walker]] (these were pull string talking dolls like Tamu), [[Julius Erving]] (a.k.a. Dr. J.), [[O.J. Simpson]], [[Marla Gibbs]], [[Redd Foxx]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Michael Jackson]]. Children could make some of these dolls "talk" by [[pullstring|pulling and releasing a string]].

;Cuddly Li'l Souls
This line featured "soft cloth-body rag dolls with natural-style hair" &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/wishbook/244875986/in/set-72157594186368474 1971.xx.xx Sears Christmas Catalog P031 sur Flickr : partage de photos !&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and clothing imprinted with uplifting phrases like "Peace," "Right On," "I'm Proud, Say It Loud", and "Learn, baby, learn."  The last phrase was a transformation of the "Burn, baby, burn" chants heard during the Watts Riots.  These dolls were given name like "Sis," "Natra," "Wilky," and "Coochy." The 1971 Sears Wish Book priced these dolls between $1.89 and $2.19.

;Little Friends Collection
This collection featured Black, Caucasian, Asian, and Hispanic boys and girls—most about 12&amp;nbsp;inches tall and with attention given to ethnic details.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dollreference.com/shindana_dolls.html Shindana - Dolls 1960's-1980's&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Career Girl, Wanda
"Each of Wanda's boxes included a little pamphlet explaining the doll's particular profession. Photos of real Black women in these professions and their comments about the nature of their jobs gave suggestions on what the child might do to learn more about the job."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/bc3/blackdollzine/dollfocus2.html Dolls in the Spotlight&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of Wanda's careers included nurse, skydiver/race car driver, tennis player, and singer.

== Other Shindana Toy Lines ==
Thanks in part to its acquisition of a company that produced board games, Shindana also started distributing games.  These games included titles like "Jackson 5ive Action Game," "The Black Experience," "The Afro-American History Mystery Game," "Captain Soul," and "The Learning Tree."

'''Tactical frivolity''' is a form of public [[protest]] involving  humour; often including  peaceful non-compliance with authorities,  carnival and whimsical antics.  Humour has played a role in political protests at least as far back as the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]] in ancient Greece.  Yet it is only since the 1990s that the term  ''tactical frivolity'' gained common currency for describing the use of humour in opposing perceived political injustice. Generally the term is used to denote a whimsical, nonconfrontational approach rather than aggressive mocking or cutting jokes.

==History of the role of humour in political protest==
[[Image:Waldemar Major Fydrych.JPG|thumb|right|[[Major Waldemar Fydrych]] founder of the Orange Alternative, seen wearing the movement's trademark elf hat at Kraków Book Fair October 2006]]
The study of humour by social historians did not become popular until the early 1980s and the literature on this subject studying periods before the 20th century is relatively sparse.&lt;ref name="HumourandProtest"&gt;

Carnivals, [[Satire]] and  the French folk custom of [[Charivari]] were discussed as mediums that allowed the lower classes to use humour to highlight unjust behaviour by the upper classes. These humorous protests were generally tolerated by the ruling authorities.  Examples of the use of humour for political protest even from Classical times, such as the play [[Lysistrata]] by ancient Greek dramatist [[Aristophanes]], have been described as "Rabeleisan protest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Studies of hunter gather tribes thought to have systems of social organisation that have changed little since prehistoric times, have found that ridicule or anger is used by many tribes to oppose any individual who tries to assume authority in a way that violates the tribe's egalitarian norms. Tribes observed to show this behaviour include the [[ǃKung people|!Kung]], [[Mbuti]], [[Naskapi]] and Hazda.&lt;ref&gt;

There is much more extensive literature covering the use of humour by the protest movements which emerged in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="HumourandProtest"/&gt;

In the United States, [[Abbie Hoffman]] is a well-known user of frivolous tactics; active in the 1960s and 70s, his actions included dropping money onto the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange, running a pig as a candidate for president, and the "levitation" of the Pentagon. One of the earliest protest groups whose use of humour has been specifically described as "tactical frivolity"&lt;ref&gt;In the 2007 book ''Complexity and Social Movements: Protest at the Edge of Chaos'' by Graeme Chesters and Ian Welsh, but speaking of the methods employed in the 1980s&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Orange Alternative]], a  movement that emerged in Poland during the early 1980s as a part of the broader [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] campaign.&lt;ref name="HumourandProtest"/&gt;  They made extensive use of visual jokes and theatrical stunts to protest against oppression by the authorities,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; a common theme was to dress up as elves (sometimes translated dwarves or gnomes). Orange Alternative have been described as the most "influential of the solidarity factions",  central to enabling the overall movement to prevail; due in part to the success their comedic "happenings"  enjoyed in attracting the attention of the world's media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romanienko|first=Lisiunia A.|date=2007|title=Antagonism, Absurdity, and the Avant-Garde: Dismantling Soviet Oppression through the Use of Theatrical Devices by Poland's "Orange" Solidarity Movement|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-review-of-social-history/article/antagonism-absurdity-and-the-avantgarde-dismantling-soviet-oppression-through-the-use-of-theatrical-devices-by-polands-orange-solidarity-movement/9D22E5AC538A0B50F2628F399C0C11CB|journal=International Review of Social History|language=en|volume=52|issue=S15|pages=133–151|doi=10.1017/S0020859007003161|issn=1469-512X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A protest movement described as partly responsible for popularising the contemporary use of "Tactical Frivolity" is  [[Reclaim the Streets]]  (''RTS'').&lt;ref name = "Emancipatory"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They formed in 1991 in Great Britain, inspired in part by the anti-road protests of the previous decades and  in part by the [[Situationists]]. As the 1990s advanced, RTS inspired splinter groups in other countries across the world, and they were heavily involved in organising the international [[Carnival against Capitalism]]—an anti-capitalism event held in many cities simultaneously on June 18, 1999. ''Carnival against Capitalism'', frequently known as ''J18'', is sometimes credited as being the first of the major international anti-capitalist protests. ''RTS'' have reported that many of their organisers were inspired by independently reading the work of Bakhtin.&lt;ref name="ACBrit"/&gt;

==Role in international anti-capitalist protests==
[[File:TacticalFloat2011London.jpg|thumb|A tactical frivolity float, surrounded by protestors at the [[2011 London anti-cuts protest]]]]
Large scale [[Anti-globalization movement|International anti-capitalist protests]] are widely seen as dawning between 1998 and 2000 with events such as the protests at the [[24th G8 summit|Birmingham 1998 G8]], ''J18'', the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|Seattle 1999 WTO protests]] and the [[Anti-globalization Protests in Prague|Prague 2000 IMF protests]].&lt;ref name="ACBrit"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "hostage"&gt;

The 1999 [[Seattle]] demonstrations saw extensive violent clashes with the police. For the 2000 protest in [[Prague]], demonstrators divided themselves into three broad groupings based in part on the way they wished to engage with the authorities. There was a   "Yellow march" for traditional non violent protest,  a "Blue march" for those who were up for physically taking on the police,  and a "Silver and Pink" group which is described as employing "tactical frivolity" &lt;ref name = "hostage"/&gt; and also in being the most successful in terms of penetrating the security cordon around the IMF meeting.&lt;ref name = "Emancipatory"/&gt; Attending Prague was also a small group specifically calling itself "Tactical Frivolity", which consisted of a Samba band plus thirteen women from [[Yorkshire]] dressed as pink fairies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/sep/23/imf.economics |title=Carnivalistas slink in with a pink revolution |date=September 23, 2000 |first=John |last=Vidal |accessdate=September 6, 2009 | location=London | work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten months later, a group of protesters dressed in carnival outfits and again calling themselves the Pink and Silver bloc, or ''Pink Fairies'', used the term "tactical frivolity" to describe their own methods when protesting at the [[27th G8 summit]] in [[Genoa]]. These included waving "magic fairy wands" at the police and training "radical cheerleaders," as well as the deployment of a "revolutionary spaghetti catapult"  designed to "splatter the leaders with pasta". The device failed to hit any leaders with spaghetti, but according to journalist [[Johann Hari]] the ''Pink Fairies'' did succeed in causing mass laughter among the crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200107300008 |title=The failure that led to Carlo's death |first=Johann |last=Hari |date=July 30, 2001 |work=[[New Statesman]] |accessdate=September 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Avoiding the road to chaos |date=March 6, 2005 |first=Robert |last=Rae |url=http://news.scotsman.com/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=2613339  |accessdate=September 6, 2009 |location=Edinburgh |work=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-these-g8-protests-are-vital-for-the-world-so-we-must-avoid-the-violence-of-genoa-494363.html |title=Johann Hari: These G8 protests are vital for the world, so we must avoid the violence of Genoa |last=Hari |first=Johann |date=June 17, 2005 |accessdate=September 6, 2009 | location=London | work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, tactical frivolity was often used at much smaller events than global summits, for example by the group  [[Billionaires for Bush]] who would stage humorous events at [[Republican National Convention|US Republican conventions]]. According to [[David Graeber]], this upswell in the use of humorous protest tactics can be traced in part to the  [[Youth International Party|Yippies]] of the 1960s and the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] which began operations in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=David |last=Graeber|author-link= David Graeber | title = The new anarchists | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 13 | publisher = New Left Review | date = January–February 2002 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/13/david-graeber-the-new-anarchists | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the  [[31st G8 summit|2005 G8 summit]] in Scotland, tactical frivolity was again used by protesters such as the [[Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The large scale use of tactical frivolity at the 2001 and 2005 G8 protests failed to deliver any tangible change in policy.  But the method continued to be used, for example at protests held concerning air travel at [[Heathrow]], England, during 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Tactical frivolity was used at the [[2011 London anti-cuts protest]]. Some of the ''tactical frivolity protestors'' integrated fully into the main march—others trailed in the wake of [[black bloc]] anarchists, while remaining non violent themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mason|first=Paul|chapter = Chpt. 3|title=Why It's Kicking Off Everywhere: The New Global Revolutions|location=London,Verso|year=2012|isbn=978-1-84467-851-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Adbusters]], the magazine credited for starting the global [[Occupy movement]], called for Occupiers to use tactical frivolity, though the method has only been used sporadically. Author and academic Luke Bretherton has suggested that tactical frivolity allows protestors to represent the otherwise inexpressible sacred power of imagination, which is achieved partly through the "use of huge puppets, dance and street theatre".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Takyeh''' ({{lang-az|Təkiyə}}) is a historical monument of the 13th century. It is a part of [[Old City (Baku)|Old City]] and located on Gazi Muhammed street, in the city of [[Baku]], in [[Azerbaijan]]. The building was also registered as a national architectural monument by the decision of the [[Cabinet of Azerbaijan|Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan]] dated August 2, 2001, No. 132.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azərbaycan Respublikası ərazisində dövlət mühafizəsinə götürülmüş daşınmaz tarix və mədəniyyət abidələrinin əhəmiyyət dərəcələrinə görə bölgüsünün təsdiq edilməsi haqqında Azərbaycan Respublikasi Nazirlər Kabinetinin qərarı|url=http://www.e-qanun.az/framework/2847|website=e-qanun.az|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The monument was built in XIII century. It mainly operated as [[mahallah]] mosque,&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt; and also as secondary school.&lt;ref name="icherisheheraz"&gt;{{cite web|title= Təkiyə|url= http://www.icherisheher.az/az/70-dini-abideler|publisher= www.icherisheher.az|language= az|accessdate= 6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, archeological excavations were conducted around the takyeh. It was restored in 1970s.&lt;ref name="icherisheher"&gt;{{cite web|title= TƏKİYƏ|url= http://www.icherisheher.gov.az/static,20/lang,az/#monument33|publisher= icherisheher.gov.az|language= az|accessdate= 6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gomap"&gt;{{cite web|title= Təkiyə (dərvişlərin ibadət etdiyi yer)|url= https://kataloq.gomap.az/az/all-poi/culture/sanctuary/96fe93a4d56611e0ad4900226424597d|publisher= kataloq.gomap.az|language= az|accessdate= 6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dervish]]es were spiritually purified, performing individual and mass religious rituals here. [[Takyeh]]s were also a shelter for traveling strangers.&lt;ref name="icherisheheraz"/&gt;

==Architectural features==
The monument is square-shaped and consists of a single room. Its facade is towards the [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]]. Unusual plan of the takyeh, as well as covering of the worshipping room with stepped domes system resulted with specificity of the interior of the monument.

== The building ==

The '''Tecumseh Opera House''' is a brick structure measures 76 feet wide by 80 feet wide. The roof is pitched and tar-covered and has sustained significant water damage, but it was repaired. Access to the second-floor auditorium is only by way of a wide staircase, at the top the ticket counter that was there has been removed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;National Register of Historic Places, Tecumseh Opera House, Tecumseh, Nebraska, National Register #J007-53&lt;/ref&gt;

The auditorium of the '''Tecumseh Opera House''' stands 30 feet wide by 60 feet, 6 inches long. The theatre does not have a balcony. The original molded white tin ceiling is still there, however it and the surrounding walls have experienced rain damage. The proscenium arch spans 20 feet across and 11 feet high. The stage floor is 18 feet deep from the beginning of the arch at the front of the stage to the back wall. The stage has no apron and contains no trap doors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The structural and historical integrity of the building has been preserved.

===== Social =====
The '''Tecumseh Opera House''' was a nonaffiliated place where people could have political meetings, church socials, basketball, and school entertainment. Before radio and television were invented to tell people about events, they were often scheduled and anticipated months in advance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Tim Lowly''' (born 1958 in Hendersonville, North Carolina) is a Chicago artist, musician, and teacher.  He is known for compassionate [[egg tempera]] pictures of children in mysterious circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Alan G. Artner, "Grabner Homes in on Subject Matter: Lanyon Exhibit Combines the Past with the Present, While Lowly Mixes Figures with Landscapes", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Thursday, May 27, 1999, section 5, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Tim Lowly was born Tim Grubbs.  From the age of three he lived in [[South Korea]], where his parents were [[Presbyterian]] [[missionaries]].  He learned piano and guitar and still plays and composes [[folk-rock]] music.  Lowly attended [[Calvin College]] in [[Grand Rapids]], Michigan, majoring in art.  He married Sherrie Rubingh in 1981, and rather than subordinate anyone's last name, they changed their surname to Lowly.&lt;ref name=Camper&gt;Fred Camper, "Temma Lowly and the Meaning of Life", ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', Friday, November 22, 2002, Vol. 32, no. 8, pp. 1, 14–20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After a visit to Korea and Europe, Lowly took up the exacting [[renaissance]] art of [[egg tempera]] painting, in which egg yolk is mixed with pigment to make paint.

The Lowlys had a daughter, Temma, in 1985, who was brain-damaged and is frequently the subject of Mr. Lowly's paintings.  Lowly says, "Part of my fairly political agenda is to say that [[disabled]] children are a part of life.  These are not freaks.  What I'm saying is that we should advocate for eyes of compassion that see human beings as human beings, rather than separating them into the beautiful, the ugly, the normal, the freak."&lt;ref name=Camper/&gt;

Lowly has been awarded an Individual Artist Grant from the Michigan Council for the Arts in 1987 and Fellowships in Visual Art from the [[Illinois Arts Council]] in 1995 and 2005.  He teaches at [[North Park University]] in Chicago.

Another of the WEAD co-founders, Estelle Akamine, was also one of the artists in residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recology’s Artist in Residence|url=http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/smm/web-academy/2011/feb11.htm|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ms. Akamine's work has also been featured at the Museum of Craft and Folk Art museum store&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum Store|url=http://www.mocfa.org/store/artists.htm|publisher=Museum of Craft and Folk Art|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has lectured at a textile lecture series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Valoma|first=Deborah|title=Textiles Lecture Series Archive|url=https://www.cca.edu/news/2012/08/27/textiles-lecture-archive|publisher=California College for the Arts|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three co-founders were featured in a discussion about women artists of the American West whose art was about current social concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohn|first=Terri|title=Nature, Culture and Public Space|url=http://www.cla.purdue.edu/WAAW/Cohn/index.html|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The directory lists a wide variety of [[Woman artists]], such as [[Marina DeBris]], a [[trashion]] artist, [[Betty Beaumont]], often called a pioneer of environmental art, and Shai Zakai.

WEAD also published a magazine, which focuses on such topics as dirty water, and the legacy of atomic energy. A recent guest editor was Dr. Elizabeth Dougherty, founder of Wholly H2O, and speaker at events such as [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] conference on [[Water conservation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Water Conservation Showcase Speakers Save Water by Going Paperless!|url=http://www.pge.com/pec/water/presentations.shtml|publisher=Pacific Gas and Electric Company|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Toulumne County's conference on [[greywater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greywater in California:  Designing, Managing, Monitoring|url=http://portal.co.tuolumne.ca.us/psp/ps/TUP_HS_ENVIR_HEALTH/ENTP/c/TU_DEPT_MENU.TUOCM_HTML_COMP.GBL?action=U&amp;CONTENT_PNM=EMPLOYEE&amp;CATGID=2651|publisher=TUOLUMNE COUNTY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Weintraub was a contributor to a recent issue of the WEAD magazine.
