It also appears from his ''Institutiones'' that he survived Caracalla.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pandects]]'' 35. tit. 1. s. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cod. 9. tit. 8. s. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  It is therefore probable that he also wrote under [[Alexander Severus]], whose reign commenced 222 AD.  Caracalla died in 217.  Another Aelius Marcianus is cited in the ''[[Pandects]]'', who was [[proconsul]] of [[Hispania Baetica]] in the time of [[Antoninus Pius]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pandects]]'' 1. tit. 6. s. 2, where Ulpian gives the [[rescript]] of Pius addressed to this Marcianus.&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of Marcianus, from which there are excerpts in the ''[[Pandects]]'', are:
*Sixteen books of ''Institutiones'', from which there are excerpts in the ''Pandects'': this work was also used for the compilation of [[Justinian]]'s ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis#Institutiones|Institutions]]'';&lt;ref&gt;compare ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis#Institutiones|Institutions]]'' 4. tit. 3. s. 1, and ''[[Pandects]]'' 32. s. 65. § 4; Inst. 2. tit. 18, "hoc colore," &amp;c., and Dig. 5. tit. 2. s. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
*Two books on ''Publica Judicia''.
*Two books on ''Appellationes''.
*Five books titled ''Regularia''.
*A single book on ''Delatores''.
*A single book on the ''Hypothecaria Formula''.
*A single book ''ad Sct. Turpillianum''.

Marcianus also wrote notes on [[Aemilius Papinianus]].  Marcianus is cited by [[Ulpian]]us and [[Paul (jurist)|Paulus]].  There are 275 excerpts from Marcianus in the ''[[Pandects]]''.

There are [[rescript]]s addressed by [[Alexander Severus]] to "A. Marcianus" and to "A. Martianus",&lt;ref&gt;Cod. 2. tit. 13. s. 6&lt;/ref&gt; which may be the same name,&lt;ref&gt;Cod. 7. tit. 21. s. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and one by [[Gordian III|Gordian]] to "A. Martianus" in the year 239;&lt;ref&gt;Cod. 4. tit. 21. s. 4&lt;/ref&gt; but this may be a different person from the jurist whose writings are excerpted in the ''Pandects''.

'''Alberto Rabagliati''' (27 June 1906 in [[Milan]] – 8 March 1974 in [[Rome]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[singer]].

== Early career==
Alberto Rabagliati was born in [[Milan]] in 1906 and was the son of [[piedmontese]] spouses: her father [[Leandro Valentino Rabagliati]] and his mother [[Delfina Besso]] were both [[natives]] of [[Casorzo]], a common on the hills of the [[Montferrat]] in the [[Province of Asti]] ([[Italy]]). In 1927, he moved to [[Hollywood]] as the winner of a [[Rudolph Valentino]] look-alike contest. He later recalled: "For someone like me, who had seen no more than [[Lake Como]] or [[Monza Cathedral]] so far, finding myself on board a luxury steamer with three cases full of clothes, a few rolls of dollars, gran-duchesses and countesses flirting with me was something extraordinary". {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} He remained four years in [[United States|America]], but his career as an actor never took off. During his stay he had however the opportunity to get to know new [[musical genre]]s such as [[jazz]], [[swing (genre)|swing]], and [[scat singing]].

Alberto Rabagliati married [[Maria Antonietta Tonnini]] in [[Rome]] in 1954.

== Singing ==
Back in Europe, he became a [[singer]]. After a brief experience with [[Pippo Barzizza]]'s [[orchestra]], he joined the [[Lecuona Cuban Boys]], a [[Cuba]]n band. He performed with his face painted black and made a hit with the song "Maria la O".

While with the Lecuona Cuban Boys he met [[Giovanni D'Anzi]] who proposed him an audition with Italian state [[radio]] station [[Ente Italiano per le Audizioni Radiofoniche|EIAR]]. Rabagliati soon became a radio star, and in 1941 had his own radio show. Every Monday night [[EIAR]] ([[RAI]]) aired ''Canta Rabagliati'' ("Rabagliati sings"), with the singer presenting his most famous songs such as "Ma l'amore no", "Mattinata fiorentina", "[[Botch-a-Me (Ba-Ba-Baciami Piccina)|Ba-Ba-Baciami Piccina]]", "Silenzioso slow", "Bambina innamorata".

He was so popular that his name was sung in the lyrics of ''La famiglia canterina'', ''Quando canta Rabagliati'', ''Quando la radio''. At a time when anything foreign was banned, the idol Rabagliati was allowed to maintain his American-influenced style. Indeed, the  [[Fascism|Fascist]] government decided to make use of his popularity by choosing his song "Sposi (c'è una casetta piccina)" ("Wed (there's a little home)") as their demographic campaign anthem.

== Acting ==
His fame as a [[singer]] helped his [[acting]] career restart. From 1940 to 1965 he acted in some twenty films, including ''[[The Barefoot Contessa]]'', ''Montecarlo'' and ''[[Il vedovo]]''. In 1966, he starred in ''[[The Christmas That Almost Wasn't]]''.

Rabagliati was active also on the [[stage (theatre)|stage]] until the mid-1950s. He performed in [[musical theatre|musical]] revues and [[comedies]] by [[Pietro Garinei|Garinei and Giovannini]].

His last public appearance was in 1974 as a guest in the TV show ''[[Milleluci]]'' hosted by [[Mina (singer)|Mazzini Mina]] and [[Raffaella Carrà]]. Soon afterward he died of cerebral [[thrombosis]].

==Australia==

Anything interfering with the health or comfort of victim which is more than merely transient or trifling has been held by Australian courts to be "actual bodily harm".

==United Kingdom==
{{see also|Non-fatal offences against the person in English law}}

===The offence===

In England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland, the offence is created by section 47 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]:

{{cquote|47. Whosoever shall be convicted upon an indictment of any assault occasioning actual bodily harm shall be liable ... to be kept in penal servitude ...; ... ...}}

The words "at the discretion of the court" omitted in the first place, and the words "for the term of three years, or to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years, with or without hard labour" omitted in the second place, were repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1892]].

The words from "and" to the end, omitted in the third place, were repealed for England and Wales by section 170(2) of, and Schedule 16 to, the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]] (subject to section 123(6) of, and paragraph 16 of Schedule 8 to, that Act).

The words "with or without hard labour" at the end were repealed for England and Wales by section 1(2) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]].

The text of this section is slightly different in Northern Ireland.

====Assault====
The expression assault includes "[[Battery (crime)|battery]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 2009 edition, at paragraph 19-195. Thomson/Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'' was decided under section 51 of the [[Police Act 1964]], which also used the word "assault" without further explanation and without any explicit reference to battery. James J. said:

{{Blockquote|An assault is any act which intentionally—or possibly recklessly—causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence. Although "assault" is an independent crime and is to be treated as such, for practical purposes today "assault" is generally synonymous with the term "battery" and is a term used to mean the actual intended use of unlawful force to another person without his consent. On the facts of the present case the "assault" alleged involved a "battery."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'' [1969] 1 QB 439 at 444D to E, [1968] 3 All ER 442 at 445&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''R v Williams (Gladstone)'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1983/4.html R v Williams (Gladstone)]'', (1983) 78 Cr App R 276, [1984] Crim LR 163, [[Court of Appeal|CA]] (28 November 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant was prosecuted for this offence. [[Lord Lane]] said:

{{Blockquote|"Assault" in the context of this case, that is to say using the word as a convenient abbreviation for assault and battery, is an act by which the defendant, intentionally or recklessly, applies unlawful force to the complainant.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1983/4.html R v Williams (Gladstone)]'', (1983) 78 Cr App R 276 at 279, [[Court of Appeal|CA]] (28 November 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''R v Burstow, R v Ireland'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/34.html R v Ireland, R v Burstow]'' [1998] 1 Cr App Rep 177, [1997] 3 WLR 534, [1998] AC 147, [1997] 4 All ER 225, ''[[The Times]]'' (1997) 25 July 1997, [[House of Lords|HL]]&lt;/ref&gt; one of the defendants was prosecuted for this offence. [[Lord Steyn]] said:

{{Blockquote|The starting point must be that an assault is an ingredient of the offence under section 47. It is necessary to consider the two forms which an assault may take. The first is battery, which involves the unlawful application of force by the defendant upon the victim. Usually, section 47 is used to prosecute in cases of this kind. The second form of assault is an act causing the victim to apprehend an imminent application of force upon her: see ''Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner'' [1969] 1 Q.B. 439, 444D-E.}}

The second form of assault referred to is the offence described as [[common assault]] in section 39 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]], which is also known as [[psychic assault]] or simply [[assault]].

====Occasioning====
[[Blackstone's Criminal Practice]], 2001, says that "occasioning" is equivalent to causing (para B2.21 at p.&amp;nbsp;172) and has a specimen form of indictment that uses the word "caused" (para B2.18 at p.&amp;nbsp;171).

In ''R v Roberts'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1971/4.html R v Roberts]'' (1971) 56 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr. App. R.]] 95, [[Court of Appeal|CA]]&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant gave a lift in his car, late at night, to a girl.

The girl said that while travelling in the defendant's car he sought to make advances towards her and then tried to take her coat off. She said that this was the last straw, and although the car was travelling at some speed, she jumped out and sustained injuries. The defendant said that he had not touched the girl. He said that he had had an argument with her and that in the course of that argument she suddenly opened the door and jumped out.&lt;ref&gt;This is how the facts are described in ''R v Savage''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Stephenson (judge)|Stephenson LJ]] said that the test for determining whether the defendant had "occasioned" the injuries that the girl had suffered as a result of jumping out of the car was this:

{{quote|Was it [the action of the victim which resulted in actual bodily harm] the natural result of what the alleged assailant said and did, in the sense that it was something that could reasonably have been foreseen as the consequence of what he was saying or doing? As it was put in one of the old cases, it had got to be shown to be his act, and if of course the victim does something so "daft" in the words of the appellant in this case, or so unexpected, not that this particular assailant did not actually foresee it but that no reasonable man could be expected to foresee it, then it is only in a very remote and unreal sense a consequence of his assault, it is really occasioned by a voluntary act on the part of the victim which could not reasonably be foreseen and which breaks the chain of causation between the assault and the harm or injury.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1971/4.html R v Roberts]'' (1971) 56 Cr. App. R. 95 at 102, [[Court of Appeal|CA]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This passage was set out in ''R v Savage, DPP v Parmenter'' at page 14.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/1.html R v Savage, DPP v Parmenter]'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The book "Archbold" says that this test applies to any case where the injury was not the direct result of the defendant's act.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, paragraph 19-195 at page 1612&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''R v Savage'', ''DPP v Parmenter'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/1.html ''R v Savage'', ''DPP v Parmenter''] [1992] 1 AC 699, [1991] 3 WLR 914, [1991] 4 All ER 698, (1991) 94 Cr App R 193, [1992] Crim LR 288, [[House of Lords|HL]]&lt;/ref&gt; Savage threw beer over the victim and, in the struggle, the glass broke and cut the victim. It was held that section 47 did not require proof of [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]] in relation to the "occasioning". The throwing of the beer was an assault, and that "assault" had occasioned the actual bodily harm which occurred in the continuing struggle. Parmenter injured his baby by tossing him about too roughly. Even though the baby was too young to apprehend the physical contact, there was voluntary contact that caused injury, so Parmenter was liable under section 47 because the injury resulted from his intention to play with his son.

====Actual bodily harm====

{{main|Bodily harm}}

In ''Rex v. Donovan'',&lt;ref&gt;''Rex v. Donovan'' [1934] 2 KB 498, 25 Cr App R 1, 30 [[Cox's Criminal Cases|Cox]] 187, 50 TLR 566, [[Court of Criminal Appeal|CCA]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Swift J., in delivering the Judgement of the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]], said:

{{quote|For this purpose, we think that "bodily harm" has its ordinary meaning and includes any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the prosecutor. Such hurt or injury need not be permanent, but must, no doubt, be more than merely transient and trifling.&lt;ref&gt;''Rex v. Donovan'' [1934] 2 KB 498 at 509, [[Court of Criminal Appeal|CCA]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This passage was cited and approved in ''[[R v Brown]] (Anthony)'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/7.html ''R v. Brown (Anthony)''] [1994] 1 AC 212&lt;/ref&gt; by Lord Templeman (at p.&amp;nbsp;230) and Lord Jauncey (at p.&amp;nbsp;242).

In ''R v. Miller'' [1954] 2 All ER 529, [1954] 2 QB 282, Lynskey J. said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;According to ''Archbold's Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice'', 32nd ed, p 959:

"Actual bodily harm includes any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the prosecutor..."&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However the House of Lords rejected this definition in ''DPP v. Smith'',&lt;ref&gt;''DPP v. Smith'' [1961] AC 290&lt;/ref&gt; a case of grievous bodily harm in which the trial judge had described grievous bodily harm as "some harm which will seriously interfere for a time with health or comfort." The Lord Chancellor, Viscount Kilmuir QC, held:

{{quote|I can find no warrant for giving the words 'grievous bodily harm' a meaning other than that which the words convey in their ordinary natural meaning. 'Bodily harm' needs no explanation, and 'grievous' means no more and no less than 'really serious'.}}

''DPP v. Smith'' was followed in ''R v. Chan-Fook''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1993/1.html R v. Chan-Fook]'' [1994] 2 All ER at 557D&lt;/ref&gt; Hobhouse LJ. said of the expression "actual bodily harm", in contending that it should be given its ordinary meaning:

{{quote|We consider that the same is true of the phrase "actual bodily harm". These are three words of the English language that receive no elaboration and in the ordinary course should not receive any. The word "harm" is a synonym for injury. The word "actual" indicates that the injury (although there is no need for it to be permanent) should not be so trivial as to be wholly insignificant.}}

He went on to say:

{{quote|The danger of any elaboration of the words of the statute is that it may have the effect, as was pointed out by the House of Lords, of altering, or at the least distracting the Jury from, the ordinary meaning of the words. Further, as can be seen from the summing-up in the present case, there may be an elision of the need to show some harm or injury. There will be a risk that language will be used which suggests to the Jury that it is sufficient that the assault has interfered with the heath or comfort of the victim, whether or not any injury or hurt has been caused.}}

''R v Chan-Fook'' also followed the case of ''R v Metharam'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Metharam'' 45 Cr App R 304&lt;/ref&gt; in which Ashworth J had said:

{{quote|It is a misdirection to adopt the old formula and invite a jury to find a man accused of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm guilty if the only intent established is one to interfere seriously with the health or comfort.}}

In ''R v. Morris (Clarence Barrington)'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1997/2564.html R v. Morris (Clarence Barrington)]'' [1998] Cr. App. R. 386 at 393&lt;/ref&gt; Potter LJ., in delivering the judgement of the Court of Appeal said (the citations that he quotes from the textbook are omitted):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;What constitutes "actual bodily harm" for the purposes of section 47 of the 1861 Act is succinctly and accurately set out in ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice|Archbold]]'' (1997 ed.) at para 19-197:

"Bodily harm has it ordinary meaning and includes any ''hurt'' (our emphasis) or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the victim: such hurt or injury need not be permanent, but must be more than merely transient or trifling ...

Actual bodily harm is capable of including psychiatric injury but it does not include mere emotion, such as fear, distress or panic ..."&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''DPP v. Smith (Michael Ross)'',&lt;ref&gt;''DPP v. Smith (Michael Ross)'' [2006] EWHC 94 (Admin), [2006] 2 Cr App R. 2, [[Divisional Court|DC]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Igor Judge, Baron Judge|Judge P.]] said:

{{quote|"Actual", as defined in the authorities, means that the bodily harm must not be so trivial or trifling as to be effectively without significance.&lt;ref&gt;''DPP v Smith (Michael Ross)'' [2006] 2 Cr App R 2 at paragraph 17, DC&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Glanville Williams said that actual bodily harm is a silly expression because it suggests that there is some form of bodily harm that is not actual.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Williams. Textbook of Criminal Law. First Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1978. Page 154. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8KpKAQAAIAAJ Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Cutting hair =====

In ''DPP v Smith (Michael Ross)'', the defendant held down his former girlfriend and cut off her ponytail with kitchen scissors a few weeks before her 21st birthday.{{fact|date=June 2017}} The Magistrates acquitted him on the ground that, although there was undoubtedly an assault, it had not caused actual bodily harm, since there was no bruising or bleeding, and no evidence of any psychological or psychiatric harm. The victim’s distress did not amount to bodily harm. The Divisional Court allowed an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions, rejecting the argument for the defendant that the hair was dead tissue above the scalp and so no harm was done. Judge P said:

{{quote|In my judgment, whether it is alive beneath the surface of the skin or dead tissue above the surface of the skin, the hair is an attribute and part of the human body. It is intrinsic to each individual and to the identity of each individual. Although it is not essential to my decision, I note that an individual's hair is relevant to his or her autonomy. Some regard it as their crowning glory. Admirers may so regard it in the object of their affections. Even if, medically and scientifically speaking, the hair above the surface of the scalp is no more than dead tissue, it remains part of the body and is attached to it. While it is so attached, in my judgment it falls within the meaning of "bodily" in the phrase "actual bodily harm". It is concerned with the body of the individual victim.}}{{fact|date=June 2017}}

It has been accepted that actual bodily harm includes any hurt or injury that interferes with the health or comfort of the victim, and which is more than transient or trifling. To damage an important physical aspect of a person’s bodily integrity must amount to actual bodily harm, even if the element damaged is dead skin or tissue. As Creswell J. commented in his short concurring judgment:

{{quote|To a woman her hair is a vitally important part of her body. Where a significant portion of a woman's hair is cut off without her consent, this is a serious matter amounting to actual (not trivial or insignificant) bodily harm.}}

=====CPS charging standards=====
The Crown Prosecution Service has revised the guidance in its publication "Offences Against the Person, Incorporating the Charging Standard" due to the enactment of section 58 of the [[Children Act 2004]] which provides that reasonable [[chastisement]] is not a defence to the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Assertions at that time that minor injuries to children could be charged as actual bodily harm were withdrawn in 2011.

The CPS previously advised that an assault which resulted in nothing more than grazes, scratches, abrasions, minor bruising, swellings, reddening of the skin, superficial cuts or a black eye should be prosecuted as a common assault in the absence of aggravating factors other than injury.&lt;ref&gt;Ormerod, D. Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law. Thirteenth Edition. Oxford University Press. 2011. Page 620. The guidance was located at www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/offences_against_the_person/#P48_1458.&lt;/ref&gt;

The charging standard states: "The offence of Common Assault carries a maximum penalty of six months’ imprisonment. This will provide the court with adequate sentencing powers in most cases. '''ABH should generally be charged where the injuries and overall circumstances indicate that the offence merits clearly more than six months; imprisonment and where the prosecution intend to represent that the case is not suitable for summary trial.'''"

And in reference to vulnerable victims such as children:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There may be exceptional cases where the injuries suffered by a victim are not serious and would usually amount to Common Assault but due to the presence of significant aggravating features (alone or in combination), they could more appropriately be charged as ABH contrary to section 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. This would '''only''' be where a sentence clearly in excess of six months' imprisonment ought to be available, having regard to the significant aggravating features.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The CPS also previously said that, by way of example, it considered the following injuries to be actual bodily harm and to be sufficiently serious that they could not be adequately reflected by a charge of [[common assault]] and ought normally to be prosecuted under section 47:

* The loss or breaking of a tooth or teeth
* Extensive or multiple [[bruise|bruising]]
* A displaced [[nosebleed|broken nose]]
* Minor [[bone fracture|fractures]] of bones
* Minor (but not superficial) cuts requiring medical treatment
* A recognised [[psychiatric disorder]]

Causing any of these injuries (by assault or battery) would constitute the [[actus reus]] of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

===Mens rea===

The [[mens rea]] of this offence is identical to that of assault or battery (depending on the mode by which the offence is committed). Accordingly, it does not correspond with the [[actus reus]]. Academic writers have termed this feature of the offence ''half mens rea''&lt;ref&gt;[[Glanville Williams]], ''Textbook of the Criminal Law'', 2 ed., 1983 p.192&lt;/ref&gt; and ''constructive liability''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith&amp;Hogan (2008). ''Criminal law text and materials'' (3rd ed.). OUP, New York, p.608&lt;/ref&gt;

The mens rea for this crime may be one of recklessness rather than [[intention (criminal law)|intention]] as to the commission of an assault or battery, and it is considered to be a crime of [[basic intent]].

The court in ''DPP v Parmenter'' ruled that, for this offence,

{{quote|...it is not necessary to show that Parmenter intended bodily harm; if he intended or was reckless as to the assault, and the actual bodily harm was a reasonably foreseeable result (whether or not it was or should have been foreseen by Parmenter himself), that is sufficient.}}

===Mode of trial===

In England and Wales, assault occasioning actual bodily harm is [[hybrid offence|triable either way]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]] (c.43), section 17(1) and Schedule 1,  paragraph 5(h)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentence===

In England and Wales, a person guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c.100), section 47; the [[Penal Servitude Act 1891]] (54 &amp; 55 Vict. c.69), section 1(1); the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]] (11 &amp; 12 Geo.6 c.58), section 1(1)&lt;/ref&gt; or on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the [[prescribed sum]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]] (c.43), section 32(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a person is convicted on indictment of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, other than an offence for which the sentence falls to be imposed under section 227 or 228 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], the court, if not precluded from sentencing an offender by its exercise of some other power, may impose a fine instead of or in addition to dealing with him in any other way in which the court has power to deal with him, subject however to any enactment requiring the offender to be dealt with in a particular way.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], section 163; this power was previously created by section 30(1) of the [[Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973]] and then by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/6/section/127 section 127] of the [[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Assault occasioning actual bodily harm is a specified offence for the purposes of chapter 5 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] because it is a specified violent offence.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], section 224(1) as read with section 224(3) and paragraph 20 Part 1 of Schedule 15&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a serious offence for the purposes of that Chapter because it is not, apart from section 225, punishable in the case of a person aged 18 or over by imprisonment for life, or by imprisonment for a determinate period of ten years or more.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], section 224(2)&lt;/ref&gt; This means that sections 227 and 228 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] (which relate to extended sentences) apply where a person is convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, committed after the commencement of section 227 or 228 (as the case may be) and the court considers that there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by the offender of further specified offences.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], sections 227(1) and 228(1)(a) and (b)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;

See ''Crown Prosecution Service Sentencing Manual''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/assault_occasioning_actual_bodily_harm/index.html Crown Prosecution Service Sentencing Manual]''&lt;/ref&gt; for case law on sentencing. Relevant cases are:

It is inappropriate for the court to sentence an offender on the basis of racial aggravation where he has been convicted of this offence, but not the racially aggravated offence: ''R v. McGilliviray''; ''R v. Kentsch''.

In Northern Ireland, a person guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c.100), section 47; as amended by the [[Criminal Justice (No.2) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004]] (SI 2004/1991 (N.I.15)), article 4(2)(a)&lt;/ref&gt; or on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months, or to a fine not exceeding the prescribed sum, or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts (Northern Ireland) Order 1981]] (No.1675 (N.I.26)), article 46(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racially or religiously aggravated offence===

In England and Wales, section 29(1)(b) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] (c.37) creates the distinct offence of [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998#Racially or religiously aggravated offences|racially or religiously aggravated assault occasioning actual bodily harm]].

===Visiting Forces===

In England and Wales and Northern Ireland, assault occasioning actual bodily harm is an [[offence against the person]] for the purposes of section 3 of the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6and1Eliz2/15-16/67/section/3 section 3(6)] and Schedule, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6and1Eliz2/15-16/67/schedule/paragraph/1 paragraph 1(b)(i)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivative offences==

In a number of jurisdictions this offence has been replaced by an offence which is very similar.

=== Australia ===

South Australia's section 20(4) of the [[Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935]] creates the offence of [[assault causing harm]].

=== Canada ===

Section 267(b) of the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']] creates the offence of [[assault causing bodily harm]].

=== Republic of Ireland ===

Section 3 of the [[Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997]] (No.26) creates the offence of [[assault causing harm]].

'''Cortisol''' is a [[steroid hormone]], in the [[glucocorticoid]] class of hormones. When used as a medication, it is known as [[hydrocortisone]].

It is produced in humans by the [[zona fasciculata]] of the [[adrenal cortex]] within the [[adrenal gland]].&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web| author =Scott E | url = http://stress.about.com/od/stresshealth/a/cortisol.htm | title = Cortisol and Stress: How to Stay Healthy |publisher=About.com | date = 2011-09-22 | accessdate = 2011-11-29 }}{{better source|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is released in response to [[Stress (biology)|stress]] and low [[Blood sugar|blood-glucose concentration]]. It functions to increase [[blood sugar]] through [[gluconeogenesis]], to suppress the [[immune system]], and to aid in the [[metabolism]] of [[fat]], [[protein]], and [[carbohydrates]].&lt;ref name="Marieb"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Hoehn K, Marieb EN | title = Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology | publisher = Benjamin Cummings | location = San Francisco | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-321-60261-9  | title-link = Anatomy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also decreases bone formation.&lt;ref name="pmid6690287"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chyun YS, Kream BE, Raisz LG | title = Cortisol decreases bone formation by inhibiting periosteal cell proliferation | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 114 | issue = 2 | pages = 477–80 | date = February 1984 | pmid = 6690287 | doi = 10.1210/endo-114-2-477 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==
=== Metabolic response ===

In the early [[fasting]] state, cortisol stimulates gluconeogenesis (the formation of glucose), and activates antistress and anti-inflammatory pathways. Cortisol also plays an important, but indirect, role in liver and muscle [[glycogenolysis]], the breaking down of [[glycogen]] to [[glucose-1-phosphate]] and glucose. This is done through its passive influence on [[glucagon]].{{clarify|date=March 2015}} Additionally, cortisol facilitates the activation of [[glycogen phosphorylase]], which is necessary for [[epinephrine]] to have an effect on glycogenolysis.&lt;ref name="Martin_2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1905485"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coderre L, Srivastava AK, Chiasson JL | title = Role of glucocorticoid in the regulation of glycogen metabolism in skeletal muscle | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 260 | issue = 6 Pt 1 | pages = E927–32 | date = June 1991 | pmid = 1905485 | doi =  10.1152/ajpendo.1991.260.6.E927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late fasting state, the function of cortisol changes slightly and increases glycogenesis. This response allows the liver to take up glucose not being used by the peripheral tissue and turn it into liver glycogen stores to be used if the body moves into the starvation state.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Elevated levels of cortisol, if prolonged, can lead to [[proteolysis]] (breakdown of proteins) and muscle wasting.&lt;ref name="pmid6365973"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simmons PS, Miles JM, Gerich JE, Haymond MW | title = Increased proteolysis. An effect of increases in plasma cortisol within the physiologic range | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 73 | issue = 2 | pages = 412–20 | date = February 1984 | pmid = 6365973 | pmc = 425032 | doi = 10.1172/JCI111227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have shown that cortisol can have a [[lipolysis|lipolytic]] effect (promote the breakdown of fat).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Under some conditions, however, cortisol may somewhat suppress lipolysis.&lt;ref name="pmid12067858"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Djurhuus CB, Gravholt CH, Nielsen S, Mengel A, Christiansen JS, Schmitz OE, Møller N | title = Effects of cortisol on lipolysis and regional interstitial glycerol levels in humans | journal = American Journal of Physiology. Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 283 | issue = 1 | pages = E172–7 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12067858 | doi = 10.1152/ajpendo.00544.2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immune response ===

Cortisol prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation.  It is used to treat conditions resulting from overactivity of the B-cell-mediated antibody response. Examples include inflammatory and [[rheumatoid]] diseases, as well as [[Allergy|allergies]]. Low-potency hydrocortisone, available as a nonprescription medicine in some countries, is used to treat skin problems such as [[rashes]] and [[eczema]].

It inhibits production of [[Interleukin 12|interleukin (IL)-12]], [[Interferon gamma|interferon (IFN)-gamma]], [[Interferon type I#IFN-α|IFN-alpha]], and [[Tumor necrosis factor alpha|tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-alpha]] by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and [[T helper cell|T helper (Th)1 cells]], but upregulates [[Interleukin 4|IL-4]], [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]], and [[Interleukin 13|IL-13]] by Th2 cells. This results in a shift toward a Th2 immune response rather than general immunosuppression. The activation of the stress system (and resulting increase in cortisol and Th2 shift) seen during an infection is believed to be a protective mechanism which prevents an over-activation of the inflammatory response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elenkov IJ | title = Glucocorticoids and the Th1/Th2 balance | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1024 | issue = 1 | pages = 138–46 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15265778 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1321.010 | bibcode = 2004NYASA1024..138E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cortisol can weaken the activity of the [[immune system]]. It prevents proliferation of T-cells by rendering the [[interleukin-2]] producer [[T-cell]]s unresponsive to [[interleukin-1]] (IL-1), and unable to produce the T-cell growth factor ([[Interleukin 2|IL-2]]).&lt;ref name="pmid6461917"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palacios R, Sugawara I | title = Hydrocortisone abrogates proliferation of T cells in autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction by rendering the interleukin-2 Producer T cells unresponsive to interleukin-1 and unable to synthesize the T-cell growth factor | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Immunology | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–31 | date = January 1982 | pmid = 6461917 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1982.tb00618.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cortisol also has a negative-feedback effect on interleukin-1.&lt;ref name="Besedovsky_1986"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Besedovsky HO, Del Rey A, Sorkin E | chapter = Integration of Activated Immune Cell Products in Immune Endocrine Feedback Circuits |veditors=Oppenheim JJ, Jacobs DM | title = Leukocytes and Host Defense | series = Progress in Leukocyte Biology | volume = 5 | publisher =  Alan R. Liss | location =  New York | year = 1986 | page = 200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though IL-1 is useful in combating some diseases, [[endotoxin|endotoxic]] bacteria have gained an advantage by forcing the [[hypothalamus]] to increase cortisol levels (forcing the secretion of [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]], thus antagonizing IL-1). The suppressor cells are not affected by glucosteroid response-modifying factor,&lt;ref name="pmid6228602"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fairchild SS, Shannon K, Kwan E, Mishell RI | title = T cell-derived glucosteroid response-modifying factor (GRMFT): a unique lymphokine made by normal T lymphocytes and a T cell hybridoma | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 132 | issue = 2 | pages = 821–7 | date = February 1984 | pmid = 6228602 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; so the effective setpoint for the immune cells may be even higher than the setpoint for physiological processes (reflecting [[leukocyte]] redistribution to lymph nodes, [[bone marrow]], and [[skin]]). Rapid administration of [[corticosterone]] (the endogenous type I and type II receptor agonist) or [[RU28362]] (a specific type II receptor agonist) to [[Adrenalectomy|adrenalectomized]] animals induced changes in [[leukocyte]] distribution. [[Natural killer cell]]s are affected by cortisol.&lt;ref name="pmid15654827"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mavoungou E, Bouyou-Akotet MK, Kremsner PG | title = Effects of prolactin and cortisol on natural killer (NK) cell surface expression and function of human natural cytotoxicity receptors (NKp46, NKp44 and NKp30) | journal = Clinical and Experimental Immunology | volume = 139 | issue = 2 | pages = 287–96 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15654827 | pmc = 1809301 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2004.02686.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cortisol stimulates many copper enzymes (often to 50% of their total potential), probably to increase copper availability for immune purposes.&lt;ref name="Weber_1984"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weber CE | title = Copper response to rheumatoid arthritis | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 333–48 | date = December 1984 | pmid = 6152006 | doi = 10.1016/0306-9877(84)90150-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|337|date=November 2012}} This includes lysyl oxidase, an enzyme that cross-links collagen, and [[elastin]].&lt;ref name="Weber_1984" /&gt;{{rp|334|date=November 2012}}  Especially valuable for immune response is cortisol's stimulation of the [[superoxide dismutase]],&lt;ref name="isbn0-12-642760-7"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Flohe L, Beckman R, Giertz H, Loschen G | chapter = Oxygen Centered Free Radicals as Mediators of Inflammation | editor = Sies H | title = Oxidative stress | publisher = Orlando | location = London | year = 1985 | page = 405 | isbn = 978-0-12-642760-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since this copper enzyme is almost certainly used by the body to permit superoxides to poison bacteria.

==Other effects==
=== Metabolism ===

==== Glucose ====
Cortisol counteracts [[insulin]], contributes to hyperglycemia-causing hepatic gluconeogenesis&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt; and inhibits the peripheral use of glucose ([[insulin resistance]])&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Brown DF, Brown DD | title = USMLE Step 1 Secrets: Questions You Will Be Asked on USMLE Step 1 | publisher = Hanley &amp; Belfus | location = Philadelphia | year = 2003 | page = 63 | isbn = 978-1-56053-570-6 }}{{better source|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by decreasing the translocation of [[glucose transporter]]s (especially [[GLUT4]]) to the cell membrane.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-144578-1"&gt;{{cite book | author = King MB | title = Lange Q &amp; A | publisher = McGraw-Hill, Medical Pub. Division | location = New York | year = 2005 | pages = | isbn = 978-0-07-144578-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cortisol also increases glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis) in the liver, storing glucose in easily accessible form.&lt;ref name="isbn0-323-05371-8"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Baynes J, Dominiczak M | title = Medical biochemistry | publisher = Mosby Elsevier | location = | year = 2009 | pages = | isbn = 978-0-323-05371-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The permissive effect of cortisol on insulin action in liver glycogenesis is observed in hepatocyte culture in the laboratory, although the mechanism for this is unknown.

==== Bone and collagen ====
Cortisol reduces bone formation,&lt;ref name="pmid6690287"/&gt; favoring long-term development of [[osteoporosis]] (progressive bone disease). It transports [[potassium]] out of cells in exchange for an equal number of [[sodium]] ions (see above).&lt;ref name="pmid13233328" /&gt; This can trigger the [[hyperkalemia]] of [[Shock (circulatory)#Other proposed types of shock|metabolic shock]] from surgery. Cortisol also reduces [[calcium]] absorption in the intestine.&lt;ref name="pmid346457"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deutsch E | title = [Pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia. 2. Distribution disorders, pseudo-thrombocytopenias] | language = German | journal = Fortschritte der Medizin | volume = 96 | issue = 14 | pages = 761–2 | date = April 1978 | pmid = 346457 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Collagen]] is an important component of connective tissue. It is vital for structural support and is found in muscles, tendons, and joints, as well as throughout the entire body. Cortisol down-regulates the synthesis of collagen.&lt;ref name="pmid3062759"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kucharz EJ | title = Hormonal control of collagen metabolism.

==== Amino acid ====
Cortisol raises the free amino acids in the serum by inhibiting collagen formation, decreasing amino acid uptake by muscle, and inhibiting protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="Manchester_1964"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Manchester, KL |editors=Allison, NH &amp; Munro JB|year=1964 |title =Sites of Hormonal Regulation of Protein Metabolism |encyclopedia=Mammalian Protein Metabolism |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |page=229? 273?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cortisol (as opticortinol) may inversely inhibit [[IgA]] precursor cells in the intestines of calves.&lt;ref name="pmid4207041"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Husband AJ, Brandon MR, Lascelles AK | title = The effect of corticosteroid on absorption and endogenous production of immunoglobulins in calves | journal = The Australian Journal of Experimental Biology and Medical Science | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 707–10 | date = October 1973 | pmid = 4207041 | doi = 10.1038/icb.1973.67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cortisol also inhibits IgA in serum, as it does [[IgM]]; however, it is not shown to inhibit [[IgE]].&lt;ref name="pmid712020"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Posey WC, Nelson HS, Branch B, Pearlman DS | title = The effects of acute corticosteroid therapy for asthma on serum immunoglobulin levels | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 62 | issue = 6 | pages = 340–8 | date = December 1978 | pmid = 712020 | doi = 10.1016/0091-6749(78)90134-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wound healing ===

Cortisol and the stress response have known deleterious effects on the immune system. High levels of perceived stress and increases in cortisol have been found to lengthen wound-healing time in healthy, male adults. Those who had the lowest levels of cortisol the day following a 4&amp;nbsp;mm [[punch biopsy]] had the fastest healing time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebrecht M, Hextall J, Kirtley LG, Taylor A, Dyson M, Weinman J | title = Perceived stress and cortisol levels predict speed of wound healing in healthy male adults | journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 798–809 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15110929 | doi = 10.1016/s0306-4530(03)00144-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In dental students, wounds from punch biopsies took an average of 40% longer to heal when performed three days before an examination as opposed to biopsies performed on the same students during summer vacation.&lt;ref name="Marucha"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marucha PT, Kiecolt-Glaser JK, Favagehi M | title = Mucosal wound healing is impaired by examination stress | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 60 | issue = 3 | pages = 362–5 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9625226 | doi = 10.1097/00006842-199805000-00025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in line with previous animal studies that show similar detrimental effects on wound healing, notably the primary reports showing that turtles recoil from cortisol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhou X, Xie M, Niu C, Sun R | title = The effects of dietary vitamin C on growth, liver vitamin C and serum cortisol in stressed and unstressed juvenile soft-shelled turtles (Pelodiscus sinensis) | journal = Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology.

=== Electrolyte balance ===

Cortisol increases glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow from the kidneys thus increasing phosphate excretion, as well as increasing sodium and water retention and potassium excretion in high amounts acting as aldosterone (in high amounts cortisol is converted to cortisone which acts on mineralcorticoid receptor mimicing the effect of aldoesterone). It also increases sodium and water absorption and potassium excretion in the intestines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first1 = Donald W. | editor-last1 = Kure | editor-first2 = Raphael E. | editor-last2 = Pollock | editor-first3 = Ralph R. | editor-last3 = Weichselbaum | editor-first4 = Robert C. | editor-last4 = Bast | editor-first5 = Ted S. | editor-last5 = Ganglier | editor-first6 = James F. | editor-last6 = Holland | editor-first7 = Emil | editor-last7 = Frei | title = Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine | date = 2003 | publisher = Decker | location=Hamilton, Ontario | isbn = 978-1-55009-213-4 | edition = 6 | first1 = Lorraine I. | last1 = McKay | first2 = John A. | last2 = Cidlowski | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = Physiologic and Pharmacologic Effects of Corticosteroids | chapter-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK13780/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sodium ====
Cortisol promotes sodium absorption through the small intestine of mammals.&lt;ref name="pmid7323700"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sandle GI, Keir MJ, Record CO | title = The effect of hydrocortisone on the transport of water, sodium, and glucose in the jejunum. Perfusion studies in normal subjects and patients with coeliac disease | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 667–71 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7323700 | doi = 10.3109/00365528109182028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium depletion, however, does not affect cortisol levels&lt;ref name="pmid592808"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mason PA, Fraser R, Morton JJ, Semple PF, Wilson A | title = The effect of sodium deprivation and of angiotensin II infusion on the peripheral plasma concentrations of 18-hydroxycorticosterone, aldosterone and other corticosteroids in man | journal = Journal of Steroid Biochemistry | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 799–804 | date = August 1977 | pmid = 592808 | doi = 10.1016/0022-4731(77)90086-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so cortisol cannot be used to regulate serum sodium. Cortisol's original purpose may have been sodium transport. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that freshwater fish use cortisol to stimulate sodium inward, while saltwater fish have a cortisol-based system for expelling excess sodium.&lt;ref name="isbn0-471-06266-9"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Gorbman A, Dickhoff WW, Vigna SR, Clark NB, Muller AF | title = Comparative endocrinology | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 1983 | pages = | isbn = 978-0-471-06266-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Potassium ====
A sodium load augments the intense potassium excretion by cortisol. [[Corticosterone]] is comparable to cortisol in this case.&lt;ref name="Muller O'Connor"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Muller AF, Oconnor CM | title = An International Symposium on Aldosterone | publisher = Little Brown &amp; Co | location = | year = 1958 | page =  58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For potassium to move out of the cell, cortisol moves an equal number of sodium ions into the cell.&lt;ref name="pmid13233328"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Knight RP, Kornfeld DS, Glaser GH, Bondy PK | title = Effects of intravenous hydrocortisone on electrolytes of serum and urine in man | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 176–81 | date = February 1955 | pmid = 13233328 | doi = 10.1210/jcem-15-2-176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This should make [[pH]] regulation much easier (unlike the normal potassium-deficiency situation, in which two sodium ions move in for each three potassium ions that move out—closer to the [[deoxycorticosterone]] effect).

=== Stomach and kidneys ===

Cortisol stimulates gastric-acid secretion.&lt;ref name="Soffer_1961"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Human Adrenal Gland | publisher=Lea &amp; Febiger |vauthors=Soffer LJ, Dorfman RI, Gabrilove JL | year=1961 | location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cortisol's only direct effect on the hydrogen-ion excretion of the kidneys is to stimulate the excretion of ammonium ions by deactivating the renal glutaminase enzyme.&lt;ref name="Kokshchuk_1979"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kokoshchuk GI, Pakhmurnyĭ BA |title =Role of glucocorticoids in regulating the acid-excreting function of the kidneys] | journal = Fiziologicheskii Zhurnal SSSR Imeni I. M. Sechenova | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 751–4 | date = May 1979 | pmid = 110627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memory===
Cortisol works with [[adrenaline]] (epinephrine) to create [[Memory|memories]] of short-term emotional events; this is the proposed mechanism for storage of [[Flashbulb memory|flash bulb memories]], and may originate as a means to remember what to avoid in the future.&lt;ref name="The Doctors' Medical Library"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kennedy |first=Ron |url=http://www.medical-library.net/content/view/1401/41/ |publisher=The Doctors' Medical Library |title=Cortisol (Hydrocortisone) |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, long-term exposure to cortisol damages cells in the [[hippocampus]];&lt;ref name="pmid19320982"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = McAuley MT, Kenny RA, Kirkwood TB, Wilkinson DJ, Jones JJ, Miller VM |title = A mathematical model of aging-related and cortisol induced hippocampal dysfunction |journal = BMC Neuroscience |volume = 10 |pages = 26 |date = March 2009 |pmid = 19320982 |pmc = 2680862 |doi = 10.1186/1471-2202-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this damage results in impaired learning. Furthermore, cortisol inhibits memory retrieval of already stored information.&lt;ref name="pmid9723618"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = de Quervain DJ, Roozendaal B, McGaugh JL |title = Stress and glucocorticoids impair retrieval of long-term spatial memory |journal = Nature |volume = 394 |issue = 6695 |pages = 787–90 |date = August 1998 |pmid = 9723618 |doi = 10.1038/29542 |bibcode = 1998Natur.394..787D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10725918"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = de Quervain DJ, Roozendaal B, Nitsch RM, McGaugh JL, Hock C |title = Acute cortisone administration impairs retrieval of long-term declarative memory in humans |journal = Nature Neuroscience |volume = 3 |issue = 4 |pages = 313–4 |date = April 2000 |pmid = 10725918 |doi = 10.1038/73873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sleep, stress, and mood ===

[[wiktionary:diurnal|Diurnal]] cycles of cortisol levels are found in humans.&lt;ref name="Martin_2003"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Martin PA, Crump MH | chapter = The adrenal gland |veditors=Dooley MP, Pineda MH | title = McDonald's veterinary endocrinology and reproduction | edition = 5th | publisher = Iowa State Press | location = Ames, Iowa | year = 2003 | pages = | isbn = 978-0-8138-1106-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In humans, the amount of cortisol present in the blood undergoes diurnal variation; the level peaks in the early morning (around 8 am) and reaches its lowest level at about midnight-4 am, or three to five hours after the onset of sleep. Information about the [[Circadian rhythm|light/dark cycle]] is transmitted from the [[retina]] to the paired [[suprachiasmatic nuclei]] in the [[hypothalamus]]. This pattern is not present at birth; estimates of when it begins vary from two weeks to nine months of age.&lt;ref name="pmid12932892"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Weerth C, Zijl RH, Buitelaar JK | title = Development of cortisol circadian rhythm in infancy | journal = Early Human Development | volume = 73 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 39–52 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12932892 | doi = 10.1016/S0378-3782(03)00074-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustained stress can lead to high levels of circulating cortisol, which can create an allostatic load.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Braveman P, Gottlieb L | title = The social determinants of health: it's time to consider the causes of the causes | journal = Public Health Reports | volume = 129 Suppl 2 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 19–31 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24385661 | pmc = 3863696 | doi = 10.1177/00333549141291S206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An allostatic load can lead to various physical modifications in the body's regulatory networks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Changed patterns of serum cortisol levels have been observed in connection with abnormal [[ACTH]] levels, [[mood disorders]] such as [[major depressive disorder]], [[anxiety disorders]], [[stress (biology)|psychological stress]], and physiological stressors such as [[hypoglycemia]], illness, [[fever]], trauma, [[surgery]], [[fear]], [[pain]], physical exertion, or [[temperature]] extremes. Cortisol levels may also differ for individuals with [[autism]] or [[Asperger's syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7976489.stm | publisher=BBC News Online | title=Asperger's stress hormone 'link' | date=2009-04-02 | access-date=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, significant individual variation is seen, although a given person tends to have consistent rhythms.

=== Effects during pregnancy ===
During human pregnancy, increased fetal production of cortisol between weeks 30 and 32 initiates production of fetal lung [[surfactant]] to promote maturation of the lungs. In fetal lambs, glucocorticoids (principally cortisol) increase after about day 130, with lung surfactant increasing greatly, in response, by about day 135,&lt;ref name="pmid2573"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Mescher EJ, Platzker AC, Ballard PL, Kitterman JA, Clements JA, Tooley WH |title = Ontogeny of tracheal fluid, pulmonary surfactant, and plasma corticoids in the fetal lamb |journal = Journal of Applied Physiology |volume = 39 |issue = 6 |pages = 1017–21 |date = December 1975 |pmid = 2573 |doi = 10.1152/jappl.1975.39.6.1017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although lamb fetal cortisol is mostly of maternal origin during the first 122 days, 88% or more is of fetal origin by day 136 of gestation.&lt;ref name="pmid7130892"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Hennessy DP, Coghlan JP, Hardy KJ, Scoggins BA, Wintour EM |title = The origin of cortisol in the blood of fetal sheep |journal = The Journal of Endocrinology |volume = 95 |issue = 1 |pages = 71–9 |date = October 1982 |pmid = 7130892 |doi = 10.1677/joe.0.0950071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the timing of fetal cortisol concentration elevation in sheep may vary somewhat, it averages about 11.8 days before the onset of labor.&lt;ref name="pmid7379742"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Magyar DM, Fridshal D, Elsner CW, Glatz T, Eliot J, Klein AH, Lowe KC, Buster JE, Nathanielsz PW |title = Time-trend analysis of plasma cortisol concentrations in the fetal sheep in relation to parturition |journal = Endocrinology |volume = 107 |issue = 1 |pages = 155–9 |date = July 1980 |pmid = 7379742 |doi = 10.1210/endo-107-1-155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In several livestock species (e.g. cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs), the surge of fetal cortisol late in gestation triggers the onset of parturition by removing the progesterone block of cervical dilation and [[Myometrium#Excitation-contraction|myometrial contraction]]. The mechanisms yielding this effect on progesterone differ among species. In the sheep, where progesterone sufficient for maintaining pregnancy is produced by the placenta after about day 70 of gestation,&lt;ref name="pmid6933207"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Ricketts AP, Flint AP |title = Onset of synthesis of progesterone by ovine placenta |journal = The Journal of Endocrinology |volume = 86 |issue = 2 |pages = 337–47 |date = August 1980 |pmid = 6933207 |doi = 10.1677/joe.0.0860337 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10972299"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Al-Gubory KH, Solari A, Mirman B |title = Effects of luteectomy on the maintenance of pregnancy, circulating progesterone concentrations and lambing performance in sheep |journal = Reproduction, Fertility, and Development |volume = 11 |issue = 6 |pages = 317–22 |year = 1999 |pmid = 10972299 |doi = 10.1071/RD99079 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the prepartum fetal cortisol surge induces placental enzymatic conversion of progesterone to estrogen. (The elevated level of estrogen stimulates prostaglandin secretion and [[oxytocin]] receptor development.)

Exposure of fetuses to cortisol during gestation can have a variety of developmental outcomes, including alterations in prenatal and postnatal growth patterns. In [[marmoset]]s, a species of New World primates, pregnant females have varying levels of cortisol during gestation, both within and between females. Infants born to mothers with high gestational cortisol during the first trimester of pregnancy had lower rates of growth in body mass indices than infants born to mothers with low gestational cortisol (about 20% lower). However, postnatal growth rates in these high-cortisol infants was more rapid than low-cortisol infants later in postnatal periods, and complete catch-up in growth had occurred by 540 days of age. These results suggest that gestational exposure to cortisol in fetuses has important potential fetal programming effects on both pre- and postnatal growth in primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Mustoe AC, Birnie AK, Korgan AC, Santo JB, French JA |title = Natural variation in gestational cortisol is associated with patterns of growth in marmoset monkeys (Callithrix geoffroyi) |journal = General and Comparative Endocrinology |volume = 175 |issue = 3 |pages = 519–26 |date = February 2012 |pmid = 22212825 |pmc = 3268124 |doi = 10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.12.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis and release==
Cortisol is produced in the human body by the [[adrenal gland]] in the zona fasciculata,&lt;ref name=About /&gt; the second of three layers comprising the [[adrenal cortex]]. The cortex forms the outer "bark" of each adrenal gland, situated atop the kidneys. The release of cortisol is controlled by the hypothalamus, a part of the brain.  The secretion of [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] by the hypothalamus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; triggers cells in the neighboring anterior pituitary to secrete another hormone, the [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH), into the vascular system, through which blood carries it to the adrenal cortex. ACTH stimulates the synthesis of cortisol and other glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and [[dehydroepiandrosterone]].

== Testing of individuals ==

Normal values indicated in the following tables pertain to humans (normal levels vary among species).
Measured cortisol levels, and therefore reference ranges, depend on the sample type (blood or urine), analytical method used, and factors such as age and sex. Test results should, therefore, always be interpreted using the reference range from the laboratory that produced the result.

* Primary [[Adrenal insufficiency|hypocortisolism]] ([[Addison's disease]], [[Nelson's syndrome]]): insufficient levels of cortisol
** Secondary hypocortisolism (pituitary tumor, [[Sheehan's syndrome]])

== Regulation ==
The primary control of cortisol is the [[pituitary]] gland peptide, ACTH, which probably controls cortisol by controlling the movement of calcium into the cortisol-secreting target cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davies E, Kenyon CJ, Fraser R | title = The role of calcium ions in the mechanism of ACTH stimulation of cortisol synthesis | journal = Steroids | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 551–60 | date = June 1985 | pmid = 3012830 | doi = 10.1016/0039-128X(85)90019-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ACTH is in turn controlled by the hypothalamic peptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is under nervous control.

When activated macrophages start to secrete IL-1, which synergistically with CRH increases ACTH,&lt;ref name="Besedovsky_1986" /&gt; T-cells also secrete glucosteroid response modifying factor (GRMF), as well as IL-1; both increase the amount of cortisol required to inhibit almost all the immune cells.&lt;ref name="pmid6228602" /&gt;  Immune cells then assume their own regulation, but at a higher cortisol setpoint.

In the short term, activation of the HPA axis in response to stress is adaptive. However, long-term stress promoting chronic exposure of tissues to high cortisol concentrations becomes maladaptive.&amp;nbsp;... Exercise, particularly sustained aerobic activity, is a potent stimulus of cortisol secretion. The circulating concentrations of cortisol are directly proportional to the intensity of exercise as measured by oxygen uptake. As is the case for the GH/IGF-1 and HPG axes, the HPA axis also receives many other inputs, including the light/dark cycle, feeding schedules, immune regulation, and many neurotransmitters that mediate the effects of exercise and physical and psychic stress [52].&amp;nbsp;... The HPA is activated by stress, whether physical (exercise) or psychological. Increased cortisol production, along with activation of the sympathetic nervous system, affects whole body metabolism. This is apparently part of the catabolic response of the entire organism, with the purpose of mobilizing metabolic fuels that are subsequently broken down to produce energy and to dampen the threat or perceived threat.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;!--Exercise – stress&amp;cortisol HPA axis--&gt; Thus, a negative net energy balance leads to activation of the HPA axis and the circulating concomitants of the catabolic state in an attempt to keep core processes functional, realizing that the stress of exercise has no effect on cortisol and circulating metabolic substrates beyond the impact of the exercise energy expenditure on energy availability [60]. Thuma et al. [61] had already made the important observation that the reported differences in cortisol levels pre- and postexercise depended on whether this difference was measured from a single pretest level or from the physiologic circadian baseline as determined in an independent session in the resting state. By this analytical technique, these investigators showed that increasing energy expenditure led to significant cortisol release. This release was apparent if they subtracted the physiologic circadian baseline from the postexercise value. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cortisol is synthesized from [[cholesterol]]. Synthesis takes place in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. (The name cortisol is derived from cortex.) While the adrenal cortex also produces [[aldosterone]] (in the zona glomerulosa) and some [[sex hormone]]s (in the zona reticularis), cortisol is its main secretion in humans and several other species.  (However, in cattle, corticosterone levels may approach&lt;ref name="pmid5062063"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Willett LB, Erb RE | title = Short term changes in plasma corticoids in dairy cattle | journal = Journal of Animal Science | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 103–11 | date = January 1972 | pmid = 5062063 | doi =  10.2527/jas1972.341103x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or exceed&lt;ref name="Martin_2003" /&gt; cortisol levels.). The medulla of the adrenal gland lies under the cortex, mainly secreting the catecholamines adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) under sympathetic stimulation.

The synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland is stimulated by the [[anterior pituitary|anterior lobe]] of the [[pituitary gland]] with ACTH; ACTH production is, in turn, stimulated by CRH, which is released by the hypothalamus. ACTH increases the concentration of cholesterol in the inner mitochondrial membrane, via regulation of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. It also stimulates the main rate-limiting step in cortisol synthesis, in which cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone and catalyzed by cytochrome P450SCC ([[side-chain cleavage enzyme]]).&lt;ref name="Margioris_Tsatsanis_2011"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Margioris AN, Tsatsanis C | veditors = Chrousos G | title = Adrenal physiology and diseases | year = 2011 | chapter= ACTH Action on the Adrenal | chapterurl = http://www.endotext.org/adrenal/adrenal5/adrenalframe5.htm | publisher = Endotext.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metabolism ===

Cortisol is metabolized by the [[11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] system (11-beta HSD), which consists of two enzymes: [[11-beta HSD1]] and [[11-beta HSD2]].
* 11-beta HSD1 uses the cofactor NADPH to convert biologically inert cortisone to biologically active cortisol
* 11-beta HSD2 uses the cofactor NAD+ to convert cortisol to cortisone

Overall, the net effect is that 11-beta HSD1 serves to increase the local concentrations of biologically active cortisol in a given tissue;  11-beta HSD2 serves to decrease local concentrations of biologically active cortisol.

Cortisol is also metabolized into 5-alpha tetrahydrocortisol (5-alpha THF) and 5-beta tetrahydrocortisol (5-beta THF), reactions for which [[5-alpha reductase]] and 5-beta reductase are the [[Rate-determining step|rate-limiting factors]], respectively. 5-Beta reductase is also the rate-limiting factor in the conversion of cortisone to [[tetrahydrocortisone]].

An alteration in [[11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1|11-beta HSD1]] has been suggested to play a role in the [[pathogenesis]] of [[obesity]], [[hypertension]], and [[insulin resistance]] known as [[metabolic syndrome]].&lt;ref name="pmid15466942"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomlinson JW, Walker EA, Bujalska IJ, Draper N, Lavery GG, Cooper MS, Hewison M, Stewart PM | title = 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1: a tissue-specific regulator of glucocorticoid response | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 831–66 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15466942 | doi = 10.1210/er.2003-0031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alteration in [[Corticosteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenase isozyme 2|11-beta HSD2]] has been implicated in [[essential hypertension]] and is known to lead to the [[syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess]] (SAME).

"'''Crossing the Bar'''" is an 1889 poem by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]. It is considered that Tennyson wrote it in [[elegy]]; the poem has a tone of finality and the narrator uses an [[extended metaphor]] to compare death with crossing the "[[sandbar]]" between river of life, with its outgoing "flood", and the ocean that lies beyond [death], the "boundless deep", to which we return.

==Overview==
Tennyson is believed to have written the poem (after suffering a serious illness) while on the sea, crossing the [[Solent]] from [[Aldworth]] to Farringford on the [[Isle of Wight]]. Separately, it has been suggested he may have written it on a yacht anchored in [[Salcombe]]. "The words", he said, "came in a moment".&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;Hill, Robert W., Jr., ed. (1971). ''Tennyson's poetry; authoritative texts, juvenilia and early responses, criticism''. New York:W. W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-393-09953-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before he died, Tennyson told his son [[Hallam Tennyson|Hallam]] to "put 'Crossing the Bar' at the end of all editions of my poems".&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

The poem contains four [[stanza]]s that generally alternate between long and short lines. Tennyson employs a traditional ABAB [[rhyme scheme]]. Scholars have noted that the form of the poem follows the content: the wavelike quality of the long-then-short lines parallels the narrative thread of the poem.

The extended metaphor of "crossing the bar" represents travelling serenely and securely from life through death. The Pilot is a metaphor for God, whom the speaker hopes to meet face to face. Tennyson explained, "The Pilot has been on board all the while, but in the dark I have not seen him…[He is] that Divine and Unseen Who is always guiding us."&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

The words have been set to music by [[Hubert Parry|Sir Hubert Parry]], [[Joseph Barnby|Sir Joseph Barnby]] Geoffrey Shaw and Dr. George Hewson, organist at St Patrick's Cathedral Dublin.

In 2014,  Ian Assersohn wrote a new setting of the words for male voices.  Assersohn's piece "Crossing the Bar" won the Composers' Competition at the Cornwall International Male Voice Choir Festival, from a field of 40 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimvcf.org.uk/2014composers.html|title=Festival20112|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assersohn is the Musical Director of Epsom Male Voice Choir,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epsommalevoicechoir.org.uk/|title=EMVC Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the choir sang the world première of "Crossing the Bar" in Truro Cathedral at the Festival Opening International Gala Concert on Thursday 30 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimvcf.org.uk/|title=cimcf.uk home page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A folk music inspired setting for the poem with a refrain was created by Rani Arbo, an American bluegrass musician. The music was written at the time her husband's grandmother was passing away. Peter Amidon has used her melody to create a choral setting.

In August 2018, the writer [[V. S. Naipaul]] died after reading "Crossing the Bar" on his deathbed in [[London]]; his family and friends citing the poem as having always held a great resonance to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2018-08-12/vs-naipaul-died-peacefully-after-reading-tennyson-geordie-greig/|title=VS Naipaul died peacefully after reading Tennyson – Geordie Greig|work=ITV News|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
&lt;poem&gt;
Sunset and evening star,
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea,

But such a tide as moving seems asleep,
Too full for sound and foam,
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;

For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far,
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crost the bar.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Crossing the Bar by  Alfred, Lord  Tennyson  : The Poetry Foundation|url = http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174588|website = www.poetryfoundation.org|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{homicide}}

In [[law of the United States|United States law]], '''depraved-heart murder''', also known as '''depraved-indifference murder''', is a type of murder where an individual acts with a "depraved indifference" to human life and where such act results in a death, despite that individual not explicitly intending to kill. In a depraved-heart murder, defendants commit an act even though they know their act runs an unusually high risk of causing death or serious bodily harm to a person. If the risk of death or bodily harm is great enough, ignoring it demonstrates a "depraved indifference" to human life and the resulting death is considered to have been committed with [[malice aforethought]].&lt;ref name=Malone&gt;''[[Commonwealth v. Malone]]'', [https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4087281/commonwealth-v-malone/ 354 Pa. 180, 47 A.2d 445] (1946).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jenée Desmond-Harris|title=An officer has been charged with depraved heart murder in Freddie Gray's death. What is that?|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/5/1/8529761/freddie-gray-depraved-murder|website=vox.com|accessdate=1 May 2015|date=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some states, depraved-heart killings constitute [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees of murder in the United States|second-degree murder]],&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie, R.J. et al.  ''Criminal Law, Second Edition.''  Foundation Press, New York, NYL 2004, p. 797&lt;/ref&gt; while in others, the act would be charged with varying degrees of [[manslaughter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/163.118 |title=§ 163.118¹ Manslaughter in the first degree |website=www.oregonlaws.org |access-date=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If no death results, such an act would generally constitute [[reckless endangerment]] (sometimes known as "culpable negligence") and possibly other [[crime]]s, such as [[assault]].

==Common law background==
&lt;blockquote&gt;It [`depraved heart' murder] is the form [of murder] that establishes that the wilful doing of a dangerous and reckless act with wanton indifference to the consequences and perils involved, is just as blameworthy, and just as worthy of punishment, when the harmful result ensues, as is the express intent to kill itself. This highly blameworthy state of mind is not one of mere negligence.... It is not merely one even of gross criminal negligence.... It involves rather the deliberate perpetration of a knowingly dangerous act with reckless and wanton unconcern and indifference as to whether anyone is harmed or not. The common law treats such a state of mind as just as blameworthy, just as anti-social and, therefore, just as truly murderous as the specific intents to kill and to harm.&lt;ref&gt;''Robinson v. State'', 3[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1995669/robinson-v-state/ 07 Md. 738, 517 A.2d 94] (1986), quoting ''DeBettencourt v. State'', [https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2260873/debettencourt-v-state/ 48 Md. App. 522, 530, 428 A.2d 479, 484] (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[common law]] punishes unintentional [[homicide]] as [[murder]] if the defendant commits an act of gross [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]].  A classic example of depraved-heart murder under the common law is in the case ''[[Commonwealth v. Malone]]'', a Pennsylvania case in which the court affirmed the second-degree murder conviction of a teenager for a death arising from a game of modified [[Russian roulette]] in which each player pointed and fired the gun at the other, eventually resulting in the death of one of them.&lt;ref name=Malone/&gt;

==Under the Model Penal Code==
Depraved-heart murder is recognized in the [[Model Penal Code]] § 210.2(1)(b).&lt;ref&gt;American Law Institute Model Penal Code (Official Draft, 1962)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Model Penal Code considers unintentional killing to constitute murder when the conduct of the defendant manifests "extreme indifference to the value of human life".

==International equivalents==

In [[Canada]], the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] categorises [[Murder (Canadian law)|murder]] as first- and second-degree for sentencing purposes. However, the Supreme Court held that murder requires, at minimum, subjective knowledge that death is a likely consequence of the defendant's actions.&lt;ref&gt;[[R v Martineau]], [1990] 2 SCR 633.&lt;/ref&gt; Mere recklessness, no matter how extreme, is not sufficient to burden the defendant with the stigma of being labeled a murderer. The circumstances that give rise to depraved-heart second-degree murder in the US only constitute manslaughter in Canada.

In [[England and Wales]], [[Murder in English law|murder]] is not classified into degrees, unlike in Canada, but sentences are more severe in cases where there are more aggravating than mitigating factors. The guidelines start with the recommended sentence for murder being 12 years if the offender is under 18; see [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales#Starting points for murder|Starting Points for Murder]]. An offender 18 years of age or older, will receive  with a minimum non-parole period of 15 years as a starting point.  Penalties increase when at least one [[aggravating factor]] (as defined in the [[Murder in English law#Starting points.2C post-2003|Criminal Justice Act]]) can be proven [[beyond a reasonable doubt]].  In cases involving multiple murders, a second (multiple) murder conviction(s), or the murder of a police officer, then the detention term can be the prisoner's whole life.  Murders classified in schedule 21 section 6 or 7 of the Criminal Justice Act are thus equivalents under English law to depraved-heart murder.

==Well-known cases==

=== 1946 Russian roulette case ===

In the 1946 case, ''[[Commonwealth v. Malone]]'',&lt;ref name=Malone/&gt; the [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]] affirmed the conviction of a teenager on the charge of [[second degree murder]] using the depraved-heart doctrine. The teenager in question had set up a game of [[Russian roulette]] which ended in the death of another teenager, a friend of the defendant. When tried for the crime of murder, his defense argued that since he had no intent to kill, the defendant could not be convicted of murder. The [[prosecution]] successfully argued using the depraved-heart doctrine that his recklessness and carelessness amounted to a level of negligence sufficient to serve as evidence of criminally culpable intent.

=== 2015 Death of Freddie Gray ===
{{Main|Death of Freddie Gray}}
Caesar Goodson, Jr., a [[Baltimore]] police officer, was charged on May 21, 2015, with second-degree depraved heart murder for his alleged involvement in the death of 25-year-old [[Death of Freddie Gray|Freddie Gray]] while in police custody. Gray died several days after he was arrested and driven in a police van to jail. The van was allegedly [[Rough ride (police brutality)|driven aggressively]] with no regard for the safety of the prisoner, who was not adequately secured for safety. Further, the prisoner was shackled, preventing him from protecting himself. The prosecution alleged that the injuries were inflicted during the ride and that pleas for medical attention were ignored. Officer Goodson was charged with second-degree depraved-heart murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0O62P220150521?irpc=932|title=Baltimore grand jury indicts police in death of Freddie Gray|work=reuters.com|accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/01/maryland-depraved-heart-murder-charge/26716749/ "What is 'depraved-heart' murder?"] (USA Today)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/3843388/freddie-gray-depraved-heart-murder/ "What Is ‘Depraved Heart Murder’?"] (Time Magazine)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/what-is-depraved-heart-murder-in-maryland/2015/05/01/b2619450-f021-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html "What is depraved-heart murder in Maryland?"] (The Washington Post)&lt;/ref&gt; He was found not guilty on June 23, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36610395 "Freddie Gray: Baltimore officer cleared of murder"](BBC News)&lt;/ref&gt; Of the six officers charged 3 were acquitted, and charges were dropped against the remaining three.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/21/us/baltimore-freddie-gray-death-officers-indicted/ "Freddie Gray death: Grand jury indicts police officers"](CNN)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eu:CROPIS''' ('''Euglena and Combined Regenerative Organic-Food Production in Space''') is a life science satellite developed by the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) and is intended to investigate the possibility of growing plants (specifically [[Tomato|tomatoes]]) in different levels of gravity, such as on the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]],&lt;ref name="skyrocket"/&gt; as a sustainable food source while using human urine for moisture and as the source of fixed nitrogen. 

==Overview==

This orbital mission will simulate and test two [[greenhouse]]s that could be scaled up and assembled inside a lunar or Martian habitat to provide the crew with a local source of fresh food, while recycling human urine into [[fertiliser]].&lt;ref name="EuCropisDLR"/&gt; Some microorganisms will be added to convert synthetic urine into easily digestible fertilisers for the tomatoes. The aim is to develop a stable, closed-loop, bio-regenerative [[life support system]] functioning in low gravity.&lt;ref name='Hauslage 2018'/&gt;

In more detail, porous [[Volcanic rock|lava stones]] will be fitted in trickle filters and dried soil containing [[Soil biology|normal soil microbial colonies]]. Microbes then use nitrite ({{chem|NO|2|-}}) to convert the harmful ammonia ([[Ammonia|{{chem|NH|3}}]]) into nitrate ({{chem|N|O|3|-}}), which is then added to six [[tomato]] seeds as liquid fertiliser.&lt;ref name="EuCropisDLR"/&gt; In addition, the system incorporates a colony of the single-cell microorganism ''[[Euglena gracilis]]'', which is a [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] algae able to produce oxygen and [[biomass]]  while protecting the whole system against high ammonia concentrations.&lt;ref name="EuCropisDLR"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Hauslage 2018'/&gt; This oxygen is necessary for the conversion of urine to nitrate until the photosynthetic oxygen production by the tomatoes is sufficient.&lt;ref name='Hauslage 2018'/&gt;

Initially, the spacecraft will replicate lunar gravity on one greenhouse for a period of six months before simulating Martian gravity on the second greenhouse for the next six months.&lt;ref name="EuCropisDLR"/&gt; The level of gravity on the Moon (0.16[[g-force| g]]) and Mars (0.38 g) are simulated by rotating the spacecraft's cylindrical body around its longitudinal axis.&lt;ref name="skyrocket"/&gt; The experiments on different payloads are realized in different positions within the cylinder.&lt;ref name="eoportal"/&gt; Tomato seeds will germinate and plant growth will be monitored with 16 cameras,&lt;ref name="EuCropisDLR"/&gt; while [[radiometer]]s called RAMIS (RAdiation Measurement In Space) will monitor the radiation inside and outside the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="EuCropisDLR"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Hauslage 2018'/&gt;

The greenhouse is made of clear [[polycarbonate]], with an approximate volume of  {{cvt|12|L|in3}}.&lt;ref name='Hauslage 2018'/&gt; The closed system features moisture, [[pH]], oxygen, pressure and temperature sensors, and is capable to control these parameters. Four small fans create airflow through a cooling device to maintain a stable "atmospheric" temperature. On top of the greenhouse, three lamps provide light in the correct spectrum for photosynthesis.&lt;ref name='Hauslage 2018'/&gt; Scanners and fluorometers measure cell density and photosynthetic yield. The fluids are monitored with seven electrodes to measure ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, pH, chloride, sodium, and potassium.&lt;ref name='Hauslage 2018'/&gt;

To monitor the health of ''Euglena gracilis'', the system also analyse the microbes' [[mRNA]] to determine which proteins —and therefore which [[genes]]— are being commanded into action.&lt;ref name='Hauslage 2018'/&gt;

==Objectives==

[[Image:020904whale 210.jpg|right|thumb|Dynamite was used to blow up a rotting [[beached whale]], with [[unintended consequences]].]]
There have been several cases of whale carcasses bursting (sometimes referred to as "exploding") due to a buildup of gas in the decomposition process. Actual explosives have also been routinely used to assist in disposing of whale carcasses – ordinarily after towing the carcass out to sea. The most well known case of an "'''exploding whale'''" was an event at [[Florence, Oregon]], in November 1970, when a dead [[sperm whale]] (reported to be a [[gray whale]]) was blown up using [[dynamite]] by the [[Oregon Department of Transportation|Oregon Highway Division]] (now the Oregon Department of Transportation) in an attempt to dispose of its rotting carcass. The explosion threw whale flesh over {{convert|800|ft|m|-1}} away. This incident became famous in the United States when American humorist [[Dave Barry]] wrote about it in his newspaper column in 1990 after viewing a videotape of television footage of the explosion. The event became well-known internationally a few decades later when the same footage circulated on the Internet. It was also parodied in the 2007 movie ''[[Reno 911!: Miami]]'' and in the 2018 Australian comedy ''[[Swinging Safari (film)|Swinging Safari]]''.

The most widely reported example of a spontaneously bursting whale carcass was in [[Taiwan]] in 2004, when the buildup of gas inside a decomposing sperm whale caused it to burst in a crowded urban area while it was being transported for a [[autopsy|post-mortem examination]].

Linnman contacted Dr. Bruce Mate, a [[marine biologist]] at the [[Hatfield Marine Science Center]] in [[Newport, Oregon|Newport]] who was there that day. Dr. Mate says that it was not a [[gray whale]], but was in fact a [[sperm whale]].&lt;/ref&gt;
At the time, Oregon beaches were under the jurisdiction of the state's Highway Division, which, after consulting with the United States Navy, decided to remove the whale using dynamite{{snd}}assuming that the resulting pieces would be small enough for [[scavenger]]s to clear up.

George Thornton, the engineer in charge of the operation, told an interviewer that he wasn't sure how much dynamite would be needed, explaining that he was chosen to remove the whale because his supervisor had gone hunting. A charge of half a ton of dynamite was selected.&lt;ref name="linnmantranscript"&gt;{{cite news

A military veteran with explosives training who happened to be in the area&lt;ref name="offbeatoregon.com"/&gt; warned that the planned twenty cases of dynamite was far too much{{snd}}20 ''sticks'' would have sufficed{{snd}}but his advice went unheeded.&lt;ref name="offbeatoregon.com"/&gt;

The dynamite was detonated on November 12 at 3:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="oreg-2013oct31"/&gt;  The resulting explosion was caught on film by cameraman Doug Brazil for a story reported by news reporter [[Paul Linnman]] of [[KATU]]-TV in [[Portland, Oregon]]. In his voice-over, Linnman joked that "land-lubber newsmen" became "land-''blubber'' newsmen&amp;nbsp;... for the blast blasted blubber beyond all believable bounds."&lt;ref name="linnmantranscript"/&gt; The explosion caused large pieces of blubber to land near buildings and in parking lots some distance away from the beach. Only some of the whale was disintegrated; most of it remained on the beach for the Oregon Highway Division workers to clear away. In his report, Linnman also noted that scavenger birds, who it had been hoped would eat the remains of the carcass after the explosion, did not appear as they were possibly scared away by the noise.
The explosives-expert veteran's brand-new automobile, ironically purchased during a "Get a Whale of a Deal" promotion in a nearby city, was flattened by a chunk of falling [[blubber]].&lt;ref name="offbeatoregon.com"/&gt;

Ending his story, Linnman noted that "It might be concluded that, should a whale ever be washed ashore in [[Lane County, Oregon|Lane County]] again, those in charge will not only remember what to do, they'll certainly remember what ''not'' to do." When 41 sperm whales beached nearby in 1979, state parks officials burned and buried them.&lt;ref name="transcriptwhaledisposal"&gt;

Thornton later that day told the Eugene ''[[The Register-Guard|Register-Guard]]'', "It went just exactly right.&amp;nbsp;... Except the blast funneled a hole in the sand under the whale" and that some of the whale chunks were subsequently blown back toward the onlookers and their cars.&lt;ref&gt;

Thornton was promoted to the Medford office several months after the incident, and served in that post until his retirement. When Linnman contacted him in the mid-1990s, the newsman said Thornton felt the operation had been an overall success and had been converted into a public-relations disaster by hostile media reports.&lt;ref&gt;

Currently, [[Oregon Parks and Recreation Department|Oregon State Parks Department]] policy is to bury whale carcasses where they land. If the sand is not deep enough, they are relocated to another beach.&lt;ref&gt;

===Renewed interest===
The story was brought to widespread public attention by popular writer [[Dave Barry]] in his ''[[Miami Herald]]'' column of May 20, 1990, when he reported that he possessed footage of the event. Barry wrote, "Here at the [Exploding Animal Research] Institute we watch it often, especially at parties." Some time later, the Oregon State Highway division started to receive calls from the media after a shortened version of the article was distributed on bulletin boards under the title "[[The Far Side]] Comes to Life in Oregon". The unattributed copy of Barry's article did not explain that the event had happened approximately twenty-five years earlier. Barry later said that, on a fairly regular basis, someone would forward him the "authorless" column and suggest he write something about the described incident.&lt;ref&gt;

As a result of these omissions, an article in the ODOT's ''TranScript'' notes that,

{{quote|"We started getting calls from curious reporters across the country right after the electronic bulletin board story appeared," said Ed Schoaps, public affairs coordinator for the Oregon Department of Transportation. "They thought the whale had washed ashore recently, and were hot on the trail of a governmental blubber flub-up. They were disappointed that the story has twenty five years of dust on it."

Schoaps has fielded calls from reporters and the just plain curious in Oregon, [[San Francisco]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Massachusetts]]. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' called, and Washington, D.C.-based ''Governing'' magazine covered the immortal legend of the beached whale in its June issue. And the phone keeps ringing. "I get regular calls about this story," Schoaps said. His phone has become the blubber hotline for ODOT, he added. "It amazes me that people are still calling about this story after nearly twenty five years."&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt;
}}

The footage that was referred to in the article, of the KATU news story reported by Paul Linnman, resurfaced later as a video file on several websites, becoming a well-known and popular [[internet meme]].&lt;ref name="hackstadtevidence"&gt;

==Tainan City, Taiwan==
Another well-known "explosion" occurred on January 29, 2004, in [[Tainan City]], Taiwan, and after the 1970 Oregon incident it was "the second exploding whale story" to have the most coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time the "explosion" resulted from a natural cause: the buildup of gas inside a decomposing sperm whale caused it to burst. The cause of the phenomenon was initially mysterious, since it unexpectedly occurred in the spine of the whale.{{clarify|date=February 2018|reason=An explosion occurred in the spine? This seems like nonsense.}} It was later determined that the whale had most likely been struck by a large shipping vessel, damaging its spine, and leading to its death. The whale died after beaching on the southwestern coast of Taiwan, and it took three large cranes and 50 workers more than 13 hours to shift the whale onto the back of a truck.

''[[Taiwan News]]'' reported that, while the whale was being moved, "...&amp;nbsp;a large crowd of more than 600 local Yunlin residents and curiosity seekers, along with vendors selling snack food and hot drinks, braved the cold temperature and chilly wind to watch workmen try to haul away the dead marine leviathan".&lt;ref name="jasonpan"&gt;

Professor Wang Chien-ping had ordered the whale be moved to the Sutsao Wild Life Reservation Area after he had been refused permission to perform an [[autopsy]] at the [[National Cheng Kung University]] in Tainan. When it burst, the whale carcass was on the back of a truck near the center of Tainan, ''en route'' from the university laboratory to the preserve.

The bursting whale splattered blood and entrails over surrounding shop fronts, bystanders, and cars.&lt;ref name="bbctaiwaneselocal"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59487">'''Felony disenfranchisement''' is the exclusion from [[voting]] of people otherwise eligible to vote (known as [[disfranchisement]]) due to conviction of a criminal offense, usually restricted to the more serious class of crimes: [[Felony|felonies]] (generally crimes of incarceration for a duration of more than a year and/or a fine exceeding $1000). Jurisdictions vary as to whether they make such disfranchisement permanent, or restore suffrage after a person has served a sentence, or completed [[parole]] or [[probation]].&lt;ref name="Bowers and Preuh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowers|first=Melanie M|author2=Preuhs, Robert R|title=Collateral Consequences of a Collateral Penalty: The Negative Effect of Felon Disenfranchisement Laws on the Political Participation of Nonfelons|journal=Social Science Quarterly|date=September 2009|volume=90|issue=3|pages=722–743|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00640.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Felony disenfranchisement is one among the [[collateral consequences of criminal conviction]] and the [[loss of rights due to conviction for criminal offense]].&lt;ref name=Siegel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siegel|first=Jonah A.|title=Felon Disenfranchisement and the Fight for Universal Suffrage.|journal=Social Work|date=January 1, 2011|volume=56|issue=1|pages=89–91|doi=10.1093/sw/56.1.89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents have argued that persons who commit felonies have 'broken' the social contract, and have thereby given up their right to participate in a civil society. Some argue that felons have shown poor judgment, and that they should therefore not have a voice in the political decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;Eli L. Levine, "Does the Social Contract Justify Felony Disenfranchisement?", 1 ''Wash. U. Jur. Rev.'' 193 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents have argued that such disfranchisement restricts and conflicts with principles of [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] and the Sentencing Project |url=http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/File/FVR/fd_losingthevote.pdf |format=PDF |title=LOSING THE VOTE: The Impact of Felony Disenfranchisement Laws in the United States |date=October 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710055712/http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/File/FVR/fd_losingthevote.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can affect civic and communal participation in general.&lt;ref name="Bowers and Preuh" /&gt;  Opponents argue that felony disenfranchisement can create dangerous political incentives to skew criminal law in favor of disproportionately targeting groups who are political opponents of those who hold power.

==History==
In Western countries, felony disenfranchisement can be traced back to ancient Greek and Roman traditions: disenfranchisement was commonly imposed as part of the punishment on those convicted of "infamous" crimes, as part of their "[[civil death]]", whereby these persons would lose all rights and claim to [[property]]. Most medieval [[common law]] jurisdictions developed punishments that provided for some form of exclusion from the community for felons, ranging from [[outlaw|execution on sight]] to exclusion from community processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:SD7ENGyN880J:www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/blj/vol22/schall.pdf+outlaw+disenfranchisement+%22Common+law%22&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl |title=pages-schall.blj.doc – Powered by Google Docs |publisher=docs.google.com |accessdate=2010-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==
[[File:Felony disenfranchisement in the United States.svg|thumb|400px|{{legend|#016450;|Unrestricted}}{{legend|#02818a;|Ends after release}}{{legend|#3690c0;|Ends after parole}}{{legend|#67a9cf;|Ends after probation}}{{legend|#a6bddb;|Circumstantial}}{{legend|#d0d1e6;|Individual petitions required}}]]

===Background===
The [[United States]] is among the most punitive nations in the world when it comes to denying the vote to those who have been convicted of a felony offense.&lt;ref name="guardian-12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/should-convicted-felons-be-allowed-to-vote-after-theyve-served-their-time/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the Constitution implicitly permits the states to adopt rules about disenfranchisement "for participation in rebellion, or other crime", by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], section&amp;nbsp;2. It is up to the states to decide which crimes could be grounds for disenfranchisement, and they are not formally bound to restrict this to felonies; however, in most cases, they do.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Felons who have completed their sentences are allowed to vote in most U.S. states. Between 1996 and 2008 twenty-eight states changed their laws on felon voting rights, mostly to restore rights or to simplify the process of restoration. Since 2008 state laws have continued to shift, both curtailing and restoring voter rights, sometimes over short periods of time within the same state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Felon Voting Rights|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights.aspx|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=March 13, 2016|date=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several Southern states, felony disenfranchisement was implemented as part of a strategy to bar blacks from voting. Conjoint with felony disenfranchisement, these Southern states implemented [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] which established severe penalties for petty crimes and were used to target black Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/magazine/ex-felons-voting-rights-florida.html|title=Will Florida’s Ex-Felons Finally Regain the Right to Vote?|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current practices===
As of 2008 over 5.3 million people in the United States were denied the right to vote due to felony disenfranchisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tomes Magazine|date=November 1, 2008|publisher=Reason|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1553510,00.html|first=Reynolds|last=Holding}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the national elections in 2012, the various state felony disenfranchisement laws together blocked an estimated 5.85 million felons from voting, up from 1.2 million in 1976. This comprised 2.5% of the potential voters in general. The state with the highest number of disenfranchised voters was Florida, with 1.5 million disenfranchised.&lt;ref name="guardian-12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/13/felon-voting-laws-disenfranchisement|title=Felon voting laws to disenfranchise historic number of Americans in 2012|author=Pilkington, Ed|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 13, 2012|accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform efforts===
Felony disenfranchisement was a topic of debate during the [[Republican Party presidential debates, 2012|2012 Republican presidential primary]]. Primary candidate [[Rick Santorum]] from Pennsylvania argued for the restoration of voting rights for convicted felons who had completed sentences and parole/probation.&lt;ref name="motherjones"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Murphy |url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/01/rick-santorum-voting-rights-activist |title=Rick Santorum, Voting Rights Activist |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum's position was attacked and distorted by [[Mitt Romney]], who alleged that Santorum supported voting rights for felons while [[incarceration|incarcerated]].&lt;ref name="motherjones" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/jan/17/restore-our-future/super-pac-rick-santorum-felon-voting-rights/ |title=PolitiFact Florida &amp;#124; Super PAC attacks Rick Santorum for supporting felon voting rights |publisher=[[Politifact.com]] |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former President [[Barack Obama]] supports voting rights for ex-offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2012election.procon.org/sourcefiles/NAACP-questionnaire.pdf |title=The NAACP 2008 Presidential Candidate Civil Rights Questionnaire |publisher=2012election.procon.org |accessdate=2013-11-08|quote="I support restoration of voting rights for ex-offenders. I am a cosponsor of the Count Every Vote Act, and would sign that legislation into law as president."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 1997 to 2008, there was a trend to lift the disenfranchisement restrictions, or simplify the procedures for applying for the restoration of civil rights for persons who had fulfilled their punishments for felonies. As a result, in 2008 more than a half million people had the right to vote who would have been disenfranchised under the older rules.&lt;ref name="SP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Felony Disenfranchisement Laws in the United States |publisher=[[The Sentencing Project]] |date=March 2011 |url=http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/fd_statedisenfranchisement.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119133453/http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/fd_statedisenfranchisement.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, more severe disenfranchisement rules have been passed in several states.

===State reforms===
In 2007, [[Florida]]'s Republican Governor [[Charlie Crist]] pushed to make it easier for most convicted felons to regain their voting rights reasonably quickly after serving their sentences and probation terms.&lt;ref name=Crist&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, however, Republican Governor [[Rick Scott]] reversed the 2007 reforms. Felons were not able to apply to the court for restoration of voting rights until seven years after completion of sentence, probation and parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Steve Bousquet |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/state-toughens-policy-of-restoring-rights-to--freed-felons/1184821 |title=State toughens policy of restoring rights to freed felons &amp;#124; Tampa Bay Times |publisher=Tampabay.com |date=2011-08-07 |accessdate=2013-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020012121/http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/state-toughens-policy-of-restoring-rights-to--freed-felons/1184821 |archivedate=2013-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 6, 2018, Florida voters approved an amendment to the state constitution to automatically restore voting rights to convicted felons who have served their sentences.&lt;ref name="voxreveal"/&gt; Lifetime bans still apply for those convicted of either murder or sexual offenses.&lt;ref name=cnbcnov2018&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/06/florida-restores-voting-rights-to-more-than-1-million-former-felons.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=voxreveal&gt;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/6/18052374/florida-amendment-4-felon-voting-rights-results&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iowa in July 2005, Democratic Governor [[Tom Vilsack]] issued an executive order restoring the right to vote for all persons who had completed supervision.&lt;ref name="SP"/&gt;  On October 31, 2005, Iowa's Supreme Court upheld mass re-enfranchisement of convicted felons. But, on his inauguration day, January 14, 2011, Republican Governor [[Terry Branstad]] reversed Vilsack's executive order, disenfranchising thousands of people.&lt;ref name="huffpo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Foley |first=Ryan J. |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/24/iowa-felons-voting-rights-terry-branstad_n_1622742.html |title=Iowa Felons' Voting Rights: Terry Brandstad Executive Order Disenfranchises Thousands |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=2013-11-08 |date=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virginia legislature in 2017 debated relaxation of the [[Felony disenfranchisement in Virginia|state's policy]] that restoration of voting rights requires an individual act by the governor.&lt;ref name="ta171024"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Matt|title=The Strangest Political Attack Ad of 2017|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/gillespie-criminal-justice-ad/543762/|accessdate=4 January 2018|publisher=The Atlantic|date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine other states disenfranchise felons for various lengths of time following their conviction. Except for Maine and Vermont every state prohibits felons from voting while in prison.&lt;ref name="SP"/&gt;

{{as of|2018}}, Iowa and Kentucky are the only two states with lifetime voting bans for felons, regardless of the crime committed.&lt;ref name=cnbcnov2018 /&gt;

===Constitutionality===
Unlike most laws that burden the right of citizens to vote based on some form of social status, felony disenfranchisement laws have been held to be [[constitutional]].  In ''[[Richardson v. Ramirez]]'' (1974), the [[United States Supreme Court]] upheld the constitutionality of felon disenfranchisement statutes, finding that the practice did not deny equal protection to disenfranchised voters. The Court looked to Section 2 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which proclaims that States in which adult male citizens are denied the right to vote for any reason other than "participation in rebellion, or other crime," will suffer a reduction in the basis of their [[United States congressional apportionment|representation in Congress]]. Based on this language, the Court found that this amounted to an "affirmative sanction" of the practice of felon disenfranchisement, and the 14th Amendment could not prohibit in one section that which is expressly authorized in another.

But, critics{{who|date=September 2018}} of the practice argue that Section 2 of the 14th Amendment allows, but does not represent an endorsement of, felony disenfranchisement statutes as constitutional in light of the [[equal protection clause]] and is limited only to the issue of reduced representation. The Court ruled in ''[[Hunter v. Underwood]]'' 471 U.S. 222, 232 (1985) that a state's crime disenfranchisement provision will violate Equal Protection if it can be demonstrated that the provision, as enacted, had "both [an] impermissible racial motivation and racially discriminatory impact." (The law in question also disenfranchised people convicted of vagrancy, adultery, and any misdemeanor "involving [[moral turpitude]]"; the test case involved two individuals who faced disenfranchisement for presenting [[Cheque fraud|invalid checks]], which the state authorities had found to be morally [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/turpid turpid] behavior.)  A felony disenfranchisement law, which on its face is indiscriminate in nature, cannot be invalidated by the Supreme Court unless its enforcement is proven to racially discriminate and to have been enacted with racially discriminatory [[animus nocendi|animus]].{{Citation needed|reason=In ''Hunter v. Underwood'', the S.C. explicitly did not endorse the constitutionality of designing disenfranchisement to deprive poor whites suffrage to undermine support for an opposition party; but there then was no further need for them to decide finally one way or the other. This means that the question was left open.|date=August 2014}}

===Classifications===
Restoration of voting rights for people who are ex-offenders varies across the United States. Primary classification of voting rights include:

====Unrestricted====
[[Maine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/21-A/title21-Asec112.html |title=Title 21-A, §112: Residence for voting purposes |publisher=Mainelegislature.org |date=2012-10-16 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vermont]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullsection.cfm?Title=17&amp;Chapter=043&amp;Section=02121 |title=The Vermont Statutes Online |publisher=Leg.state.vt.us |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the only states with unrestricted voting rights for people who are felons.  Both states allow the person to vote during incarceration, via [[absentee ballot]] and after terms of conviction end.

====Ends after release====
In fourteen states and the District of Columbia, disenfranchisement ends after incarceration is complete:

In February 2016 the [[Maryland]] General Assembly restored the right to vote for more than 40,000 released felons, overriding a veto by Governor [[Larry Hogan]]. Maryland's Senate approved the bill on a narrow 29-18 vote, while the state House of Delegates voted 85-56 in favor of it on January 20. Convicted felons under parole or probation had their right to vote restored. The law went into effect in late March, one month before the state's April 26 primaries.&lt;ref name="restore"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/maryland-felon-voting/462000/ Matt Ford, "Restoring Voting Rights for Felons in Maryland"], ''The Atlantic,'' 9 February 2016, accessed 23 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Circumstantial====
Six states have laws that relate disenfranchisement to the detail of the crime. These laws restore voting rights to some offenders on the completion of incarceration, parole, and probation. Other offenders must make an individual petition that could be denied.

*[[Alabama]] –  A person convicted of a felony loses the ability to vote if the felony involves moral turpitude. Prior to 2017, the state Attorney General and courts have decided this for individual crimes; however, in 2017, moral turpitude was defined by House Bill 282 of 2017, signed into law by [[Kay Ivey]] on May 24, to constitute 47 specific offenses.&lt;ref name=2017law&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://legiscan.com/AL/text/HB282/2017|title=Bill Text: AL HB282, 2017, Regular Session, Engrossed|accessdate=January 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a convicted person loses the ability to vote based on having committed a defined act of moral turpitude, he can petition to have it restored by a pardon or by a certificate of eligibility; if the loss of elective franchise was based on a crime not under moral turpitude, eligibility to vote is automatically restored once all sentence conditions have been satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/17-3-31.htm |title=Section 17-3-31 |publisher=Alisondb.legislature.state.al.us |accessdate=2013-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107072426/http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/17-3-31.htm |archivedate=2014-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="al-pardons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pardons.state.al.us/alabpp/Divisions/Pardons/pardons_unit.htm |title=Alabama Pardons Unit |publisher=Pardons.state.al.us |accessdate=2013-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107072227/http://www.pardons.state.al.us/alabpp/Divisions/Pardons/pardons_unit.htm |archivedate=2014-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NACDL|title=State narrative: Alabama|url=https://www.nacdl.org/uploadedFiles/files/resource_center/2012_restoration_project/state_narr_al.pdf|work=NACDL Jurisdiction Profiles|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alabama ex-felon voting brochure 2010|url=http://www.aclualabama.org/WhatWeDo/ALExFelonVotingBrochure2010.pdf|publisher=ACLU of Alabama|accessdate=7 January 2014|year=2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107071155/http://www.aclualabama.org/WhatWeDo/ALExFelonVotingBrochure2010.pdf|archive-date=7 January 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 2017, a person convicted of a number of crimes having to do with sexual assault or abuse, including [[sodomy]], was ineligible to receive a certificate of eligibility; today, only impeachment and treason remain ineligible for a certificate of eligibility.&lt;ref name="pardons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pardons.state.al.us/alabpp/Divisions/Pardons/pardons_unit.htm |title=Pardons Unit |publisher=Pardons.state.al.us |accessdate=2013-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107072227/http://www.pardons.state.al.us/alabpp/Divisions/Pardons/pardons_unit.htm |archivedate=2014-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Mississippi]] – A convicted person loses suffrage for numerous crimes identified in the state constitution, Section 241 (see note). The list is given below. Suffrage can be restored to an individual by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the legislature. The crimes that disqualify a person from voting are given in Section 241 of the state constitution as: murder, rape, bribery, theft, arson, obtaining money or goods under false pretense, [[perjury]], [[forgery]], [[embezzlement]] or [[bigamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.ms.us/ed_pubs/constitution/constitution.asp |title=Constitution Of The State Of Mississippi |publisher=Sos.state.ms.us |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Tennessee]] – A person who is convicted of certain felonies may not regain voting rights except through pardon. These include: murder, rape, treason, and voting fraud. For a person convicted of a lesser felony, disenfranchisement ends after terms of incarceration, completion of parole, and completion of probation. In addition, the person must pay "Any court order restitution paid; current in the payment of any child support obligations; and/or Any court ordered court costs paid".

{{Voting rights in the United States}}

==In Europe==
In general, during the recent centuries, the European countries have increasingly made suffrage more accessible. This has included retaining disenfranchisement in fewer and fewer cases, including for criminal offenses. Moreover, most European states, including most of those outside the [[European Union]], have ratified the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], and thereby agreed to respect the decisions of the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;In the neutral field in Strasbourg is still wide open the play on rule of law in electoral matters: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Decreto Severino: c'è un giudice a Strasburgo|journal= Mondoperaio edizione online|date=2015| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89429887}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case ''[[Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)]]'' the Court in 2005 found that general rules for automatic disenfranchisements resulting from convictions to be against human rights. This ruling applied equally for prisoners and for ex-convicts. The ruling did not exclude the possibility of disenfranchisement as a consequence of deliberation in individual cases (such as that of [[Mohammed Bouyeri]]). The United Kingdom has not respected this Court opinion, although it is a signatory to the Convention (see below).

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, prohibitions from voting are codified in section 3 and 3A of the [[Representation of the People Act 1983]].&lt;ref name = RPA83&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=2353486 |title=Representation of the People Act 1983 (c. 2) – Statute Law Database |publisher=www.statutelaw.gov.uk |accessdate=2010-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excluded are incarcerated criminals&lt;ref&gt;although not specifically felons; the distinction between felony and misdemeanor was abolished by the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]]&lt;/ref&gt; (including those sentenced by [[courts-martial]], those unlawfully at large from such sentences, and those committed to psychiatric institutions as a result of a criminal court sentencing process). Civil prisoners sentenced (for non-payment of fines, or [[contempt of court]], for example), and those on [[Remand (detention)|remand]] unsentenced retain the right to vote.

The UK is subject to Europe-wide rules due to various treaties and agreements associated with its membership of the [[European Community]]. The Act does not apply to elections to the [[European Parliament]]. Following ''[[Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)]]'' (2005),&lt;ref&gt;42 EHHR 41&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ruled such a ban to be disproportionate, the policy was reviewed by the UK government. In 2005 the [[Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs]], [[Charles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton|Lord Falconer of Thoroton]], stated that the review may result in the UK allowing some prisoners to vote.&lt;ref name="uk-review"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4315348.stm |title=Convicts 'will not all get vote'|publisher=BBC News|date= October 6, 2005| accessdate= December 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the UK was still reviewing the policy, following an "unprecedented warning" from the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref name = update&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/09/prisoners-vote-general-election-europe |title=Prisoners must be allowed to vote, Council of Europe warns Britain |publisher=guardian.co.uk |accessdate=2010-10-30 |location=London |first=Alan |last=Travis |date=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government position was then that

{{quote|It remains the government's view that the right to vote goes to the essence of the offender's relationship with democratic society, and the removal of the right to vote in the case of some convicted prisoners can be a proportionate and proper response following conviction and imprisonment. The issue of voting rights for prisoners is one that the government takes very seriously and that remains under careful consideration.&lt;ref name = update/&gt;}}

Parliament voted in favor of maintaining disenfranchisement of prisoners in 2011 in response to Government plans to introduce legislation. Since then the Government has repeatedly stated that prisoners will not be given the right to vote in spite of the ECHR ruling.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20053244], 24 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the ECHR ruling, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice [[Chris Grayling]] produced a draft [[Voting Eligibility (Prisoners) Bill]] for discussion by a Joint Committee, incorporating two clear options for reform and one which would retain the blanket ban.

===Ireland===
For [[elections in the Republic of Ireland]], there is no disenfranchisement based on criminal conviction, and prisoners remain on the [[electoral register]] at their pre-imprisonment address.&lt;ref name="citizensinformation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/prison_system/prisoners_rights.html|title=Prisoners' Rights|publisher=Citizens Information Board|accessdate=25 October 2012|location=Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 2006, the grounds for [[postal voting]] did not include imprisonment, and hence those in prison on election day were in practice unable to vote, although those on [[temporary release]] could do so.&lt;ref name="dail20061005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2006/10/05/00008.asp |title=Dáil Eireann - 05/Oct/2006 Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2006: Second Stage |publisher=Debates.oireachtas.ie |date=2006-10-05 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/europe-court-rules-prisoners-should-be-let-vote-in-elections-234642.html|title=Europe court rules prisoners should be let vote in elections|last=Quinn|first=Ben|author2=Conor Sweeney|date=7 October 2005|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] ruled that this breached the [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]], and the government drafted a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] extending postal voting to prisoners on [[Detention of suspects|remand]] or serving sentences of less than six months.&lt;ref name="ind226084"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/goahead-for-prisoners-to-cast-vote-at-next-election-226084.html |title=Go-ahead for prisoners to cast vote at next election |last=Brady |first=Tom |date=15 December 2005 |work=[[Irish Independent]] |accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2001, the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]] overturned the High Court ruling and the bill was withdrawn.&lt;ref name="ind226084"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breathnach -v- Ireland &amp; anor; [2001] IESC 59: Judgments of [http://courts.ie/Judgments.nsf/bce24a8184816f1580256ef30048ca50/fddba2cbc75b154e80256ccc005c3756?OpenDocument Keane C.J.] and [http://courts.ie/Judgments.nsf/bce24a8184816f1580256ef30048ca50/fded91c3fda8f0bf80256ccc00384f9a?OpenDocument Denham J.]&lt;/ref&gt;  After the 2005 ECHR ruling in [[Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)|the Hirst case]], the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006 was passed to allow postal voting by all prisoners.&lt;ref name="citizensinformation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dail20061005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0033/print.html |title=Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In Italy, the most serious offenses involve the loss of voting rights, while for less serious offenses disqualification the judge can choose if there will be some disenfranchisement. Recently, however, the 'decree Severino' added a loss of only the right to stand for an election, against some offenders above a certain threshold of imprisonment:&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/17100946/Dopo_la_sentenza_20_ottobre_2015 Severino: c'è un giudice a Strasburgo Mondoperaio, 21 ottobre 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; it operates administratively, with fixed duration and without intervention of the court. Many court actions have been presented, but the electoral disputes follows antiquated rules and the danger of causes seamless in terms of eligibility&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/11436063/Il_contenzioso_elettorale_ai_diversi_livelli_istituzionali {{lang|it|Giampiero Buonomo, Il condannato?

===Other European countries===
Several European countries permit disenfranchisement by special court order, including France, Germany (reinstated after 2–5 years) and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kiesraad.nl/verkiezingen/tweede-kamer/stemmen/uitsluiting-kiesrecht|title=Uitsluiting kiesrecht|last=Kiesraad|website=www.kiesraad.nl|language=nl-NL|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several others, no disenfranchisements due to criminal convictions exist. Moreover, many European countries encourage people to vote, such as by making pre-voting in other places than the respective election locales easily accessible. This often includes possibilities for prisoners to pre-vote from the prison itself. This is the case for example in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1998/en19980714.pdf |title= Election Act 714/1998 |date= |year= 1998 |department= |website= Finlex |series= Translations of Finnish acts and decrees |publisher= Ministry of Justice, Finland |pages= 1, 24 |format= pdf |access-date= 25 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany the law calls on prisons to encourage prisoners to vote. Only those convicted of [[electoral fraud]] and crimes undermining the "democratic order", such as [[treason]], are barred from voting while in prison.&lt;ref&gt;"Losing the Vote," p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Australia==
At [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in Australia the ''Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902'' denied the franchise to vote to anyone 'attainted of treason, or who had been convicted and is under sentence or subject to be sentenced for any offence ... punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer'.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{citation|title=Prisoner voting rights|first=Lisa|last=Hill|publisher=Australian Review of Public Affairs|url=http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2009/11/hill.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318061231/http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2009/11/hill.html|archivedate=18 March 2013|deadurl=no|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 this disqualification was relaxed and prisoners serving a sentence for a crime punishable under the law for less than a maximum five years were allowed to vote.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/CIB/cib0304/04cib12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301121320/http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/CIB/cib0304/04cib12|archivedate=1 March 2014|title=Inside outcasts: prisoners and the right to vote in Australia|deadurl=no|first=Jerome|last=Davidson|date=24 May 2004|publisher=Parliament of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further softening occurred in 1995 when the disenfranchisement was limited to those serving a sentence of five years or longer,&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt; although earlier that year the [[Keating Government]] had been planning legislation to extend voting rights to all prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|first=Paul|last=Keating|title=For Media: Prisoner voting|date=10 July 1995|url=http://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/browse.php?did=9664|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824135405/http://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/browse.php?did=9664|archivedate=24 August 2014|author-link=Paul Keating}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disenfranchisement does not continue after release from jail/prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Prisoners|url = http://www.aec.gov.au/Enrolling_to_vote/special_category/Prisoners.htm|website = Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate = 2015-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Howard Government]] legislated in 2006 to ban all prisoners from voting. In 2007, the [[High Court of Australia]] in ''[[Roach v Electoral Commissioner]]'' found that the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian constitution]] enshrined a limited right to vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/court-gives-vote-back-to-some-inmates/2007/08/30/1188067277253.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824053414/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/court-gives-vote-back-to-some-inmates/2007/08/30/1188067277253.html|archivedate=24 August 2008|title=Court gives vote back to some inmates|date=31 August 2007|first=Jonathan|last=Pearlman|publisher=Fairfax Media|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; which meant that citizens serving relatively short prison sentences (generally less than three years) cannot be barred from voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/right-vote-not-enjoyed-equally-all-australians#fnB9a |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814083152/https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/right-vote-not-enjoyed-equally-all-australians |archivedate=14 August 2014 |title=The right to vote is not enjoyed equally by all Australians: 4.

Depending on the threshold of exclusion which is distinct in each state, a prisoner may be able to vote in either state elections or federal elections. For example, prisoners in New South Wales serving a sentence of longer than one year are not entitled to vote in state elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite Legislation AU |NSW|act|peea1912|Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Act 1912|25(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other countries ==
Most democracies give convicted criminals the same voting rights as other citizens.

In [[Taiwan]] the abrogation of political rights is a form of punishment used in sentencing, available only for some crimes or along with a sentence of death or imprisonment for life. Rights that are suspended in such a sentence include the right to vote and to take public office, as well as the rights to political expression, assembly, association, and protest. In China, there is a similar punishment of [[Deprivation of Political Rights]].

In New Zealand, people who are in prison are not entitled to enroll while they are in prison. Persons who are convicted of electoral offenses in the past 3 years cannot vote or stand for office. In November 2018, the New Zealand Supreme Court ruled that such restrictions are inconsistent with the nation's Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12156876|archiveurl=http://archive.is/FBl2P|archivedate=9 November 2018|title=Supreme Court upholds decision saying ban on prisoner voting inconsistent with Bill of Rights
|date=9 November 2018|first=Sam|last=Hurley|publisher= New Zealand Media and Entertainment |newspaper= The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries allow inmates to vote, including  [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2010/index.do Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer), [2002&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 3 SCR 519, 2002 SCC 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-2.01/section-245.html ''Canada Elections Act'', SC 2000, c 9, s 245.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Israel]], [[Kenya]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Peru]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Sweden]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

On 8 December 2008, [[Leung Kwok Hung]] (Long Hair), member of [[Hong Kong]]'s popularly elected [[Legislative Council]] (LegCo), and two prison inmates, successfully challenged disenfranchisement provisions in the LegCo electoral laws. The court found blanket disenfranchisement of prisoners to be in violation of Article 26 of the Basic Law and Article 21 of the Bill of Rights and the denial to persons in custody of access to polling stations as against the law. The government introduced a bill to repeal the provisions of the law disenfranchising persons convicted of crimes (even those against the electoral system) as well as similar ones found in other electoral laws, and it made arrangements for polling stations to be set up at detention centers and prisons. LegCo passed the bill, and it took effect from 31 October 2009, even though no major elections were held until the middle of 2011.

'''''Flatliners''''' is a 1990 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[psychological horror]] film directed by [[Joel Schumacher]], produced by [[Michael Douglas]] and Rick Bieber, and written by Peter Filardi.  It stars [[Kiefer Sutherland]], [[Julia Roberts]], [[William Baldwin]], [[Oliver Platt]], and [[Kevin Bacon]]. The film is about five medical students who attempt to find out what lies [[Afterlife|beyond death]] by conducting clandestine experiments that produce [[near-death experience]]s. The film was shot on the campus of [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]] (Chicago) between October 1989 and January 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonymoviechannel.com/movies/flatliners/details|title=Flatliners - Sony Movie Channel|website=www.sonymoviechannel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]] in 1990 ([[Charles L. Campbell]] and [[Richard C. Franklin]]). The film was theatrically released on August 10, 1990, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It grossed $61 million at the box office. 

A [[Flatliners (2017 film)|remake]] directed by Danish filmmaker [[Niels Arden Oplev]], was released in September 2017, and also featured Kiefer Sutherland in a starring role (albeit a different role).

==Plot==
&lt;!-- IMPORTANT NOTICE: Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing. Plot summaries are recommended to be 400-700 words. --&gt;
Nelson Wright, a medical student, walks onto a beach one day and proclaims “today is a good day to die”. He later convinces four of his medical school classmates—Joe Hurley, David Labraccio, Randy Steckle, and Rachel Manus—to help him discover what lies beyond death. Nelson flatlines for one minute before his classmates resuscitate him. While "dead", he experiences a sort of afterlife. He sees a vision of a boy he bullied as a child, Billy Mahoney. He merely tells his friends that he cannot describe what he saw, but something is there. The others follow Nelson's daring feat.

Joe flatlines next, and he experiences an erotic afterlife sequence. He agrees with Nelson's claim that something indeed exists. David is third to flatline, and he sees a vision of a girl, Winnie Hicks, whom he bullied in grade school. The three men start to experience hallucinations related to their afterlife visions. Nelson gets physically beat up by Billy Mahoney twice. Joe, engaged to be married, is haunted by his home videos of his sexual dalliances with other women. David finds Winnie Hicks on a train, and she verbally taunts him the way he taunted her. 

Rachel decides to flatline next on Halloween. David tries to stop the others from giving Rachel their same fate, but she is already "dead" when he arrives. Rachel nearly dies for good after the power goes out, and the men are unable to shock her with the [[defibrillator]] paddles. Luckily, she survives, but she, too, is haunted by the memory of her father committing suicide when she was young.

The three men finally reveal their harrowing experiences to one another, and David decides to put his visions to a stop. Meanwhile, Joe's fiancée, Anne, comes to his apartment, and she breaks up with him after she discovers his videos. Joe's visions cease after Anne leaves him. 

David goes to visit Winnie Hicks, now grown up, and apologizes to her. Winnie accepts his apology and thanks him. David immediately feels a weight lifted off his shoulders. Then, David finds Nelson, who accompanied David to visit Winnie, beating himself with a climbing axe. In Nelson's mind, however, Billy Mahoney is attempting for a third time to beat him to death. David stops him, and they return to town.

Rachel seeks comfort in the arms of David, and the two spend the night together. While Rachel and David are together, Nelson takes Steckle and Joe to a graveyard. He reveals that he killed Billy Mahoney as a kid by throwing rocks at him until he fell out of a tree. Nelson storms off, leaving Joe and Steckle stranded.

David leaves Rachel alone in order to rescue Joe and Steckle at the cemetery. While alone, Rachel goes to the bathroom, and finds her father. He apologizes to his daughter, and her guilt over his death is lifted when she discovers that he was addicted to heroin. Then, Nelson calls Rachel, and he tells her that he needs to flatline again in order to make amends. He apologizes for involving her and their friends in his stupid plan.

The three men race to Nelson, who has been dead for an estimated nine minutes already. Rachel soon finds them, and the four friends work feverishly to save Nelson. In the afterlife, Nelson is experiencing himself as a young boy being stoned by Billy Mahoney from the tree. Nelson dies in the afterlife from the fall, and his friends cannot revive him. When they are about to give up, Mahoney forgives Nelson, and David gives Nelson one last shock. This brings him back, and Nelson tells them, "Today wasn't a good day to die."

In her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Caryn James wrote, "when taken on its own stylish terms, ''Flatliners'' is greatly entertaining.

[[Image:Das werdenSie ja nachher schon sehen.jpg|thumb|A poster by [[Henri Gerbault]] depicting flirting between a man and a woman]]

'''Flirting''' or '''coquetry''' is a [[Social behavior|social]] and [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] involving verbal or written communication, as well as [[body language]], by one person to another, either to suggest interest in a deeper relationship with the other person, or if done playfully, for amusement.

In most cultures, it is socially disapproved for a person to make explicit sexual advances in public, or in private to someone not romantically acquainted, but indirect or suggestive advances may at times be considered acceptable.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Flirting usually involves speaking and behaving in a way that suggests a mildly greater [[intimacy]] than the actual [[personal relationship|relationship]] between the parties would justify, though within the rules of social [[etiquette]], which generally disapproves of a direct expression of sexual interest in the given setting. This may be accomplished by communicating a sense of playfulness or irony. [[Double entendre]]s (where one meaning is more formally appropriate, and another more suggestive) may be used. Body language can include flicking the hair, eye contact, brief touching, open stances, proximity, and other gestures. Vocal communication of interest can include, for example,
* alterations in vocal tone (such as pace, volume, and intonation), and
* challenges (including teasing, questions, qualifying, and feigned disinterest), which reason may to serve to increase tension, and to test intention and congruity.

Flirting behavior varies across cultures due to different modes of social etiquette, such as how closely people should stand ([[proxemics]]), how long to hold eye contact, how much touching is appropriate and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,419712,00.html |title=Scoring a German: Flirting with Fräuleins, Hunting for Herren  |publisher=Spiegel.de |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, some behaviors may be more universal. For example, ethologist [[Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt]] found that in places as different as Africa and North America, women exhibit similar flirting behavior, such as a prolonged stare followed by a [[head tilt]] away with a little [[smile]], as seen in the accompanying image associated with a [[Hollywood film]].[[File:Marilyn Monroe and Cary Grant in Monkey Business trailer 3.JPG|thumb|right|Laurel (played by [[Marilyn Monroe]]) flirting with Dr. Fulton (played by [[Cary Grant]]) in the film ''[[Monkey Business (1952 film)|Monkey Business]]'']]

==Etymology==
The origin of the word ''[[wikt:flirt|flirt]]'' is obscure. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (first edition) associates it with such onomatopoeic words as ''flit'' and ''flick'', emphasizing a lack of seriousness; on the other hand, it has been attributed to the old French ''conter fleurette'', which means "to (try to) [[seduction|seduce]]" by the dropping of flower petals, that is, "to speak sweet nothings". While old-fashioned, this expression is still used in French, often mockingly, but the English [[gallicism]] ''to flirt'' has made its way and has now become an [[anglicism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k486334v/f532.item|title=Mémoires de l'Académie royale du Gard|first=Académie de Nîmes. Auteur du|last=texte|date=9 August 1876|website=Gallica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''fleurette'' was used in the 16th century in some sonnets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5734760f/f340.image|title=La famine, ou Les Gabéonites, tragédie prise de la Bible et suivant celle de Saül, ensemble plusieurs autres oeuvres poëtiques de Jehan de La Taille de Bondaroy...|first1=La Taille, Jean de (1535?-1611?).

Auteur du|last=texte|date=9 August 2018|website=Gallica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French word ''fleurette'' (small flower), and the language of old south France word ''flouretas'' (from the Latin ''flora''(for flower)), are related to some little says where flowers are both at the same time a pretext and the comparison terms. In southern France, some usage were yet used in 1484,&lt;ref&gt;Revue des langues romanes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|language = French|author = [[Émile Littré]]|title=fleurette|work = Dictionnaire de la langue française|URL = http://www.littre.org/definition/fleurette}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In French, some other words more or less related are derived from the word fleur: for instance ''effleurer'' (English: lightly touch) from 13th century ''esflourée''; ''déflorer'' (English: deflower) from 13th century ''desflorer'' or ([[Foil (fencing)|fleuret]] (English Foil) 18th century).

In 1592 the future King Henry IV lived in Nerac in southern France. He had an affair (one of reportedly about 75) with the gardener's daughter Fleurette.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} He subsequently disavowed her as he was after all the future king and she but a gardener's daughter.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}  Fleurette was so distraught that she drowned herself and there is in Nerac a beautiful statue to her as her body was recovered.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}  The story became known across France as a tale of the rich and poor, the powerful and the powerless.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}  'conter Fleurette' became a phrase that you might use when a young girl is discarded by a lover.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}  The word also entered the English language as 'flirting'.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Anyway, the association of flowers, spring, youth, and women is not modern and were yet considered in ancient culture, such as the [[Chloris]] in ancient Greece, or [[Flora (deity)]] in ancient Roman empire, including [[Floralia]] festival, and in older poems:

During World War II, anthropologist [[Margaret Mead]] was working in Britain for the British [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] and later for the U.S. [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]],&lt;ref name="uk"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She observed in the flirtations between the American soldiers and British women a pattern of misunderstandings regarding who is supposed to take which initiative. She wrote of the Americans, "The boy learns to make advances and rely upon the girl to repulse them whenever they are inappropriate to the state of feeling between the pair", as contrasted to the British, where "the girl is reared to depend upon a slight barrier of chilliness... which the boys learn to respect, and for the rest to rely upon the men to approach or advance, as warranted by the situation." This resulted, for example, in British women interpreting an American soldier's gregariousness as something more intimate or serious than he had intended.&lt;ref name="uk"/&gt;

Communications theorist [[Paul Watzlawick]] used this situation, where "both American soldiers and British girls accused one another of being sexually brash", as an example of differences in "punctuation" in interpersonal communications. He wrote that courtship in both cultures used approximately 30 steps from "first eye contact to the ultimate consummation", but that the sequence of the steps was different. For example, kissing might be an early step in the American pattern but a relatively intimate act in the English pattern.&lt;ref&gt;

Japanese courtesans had another form of flirting, emphasizing non-verbal relationships by hiding the lips and showing the eyes, as depicted in much [[Shunga (art)|Shunga art]], the most popular print media at the time, until the late 19th century.

===European hand fans===
{{Further|European hand fans in the 18th century}}
The fan was extensively used as a means of communication and therefore a way of flirting from the 16th century onwards in some European societies, especially [[England]] and [[Spain]]. A whole sign language was developed with the use of the fan, and even [[etiquette]] books and magazines were published. Charles Francis Badini created the Original Fanology or Ladies' Conversation Fan which was published by William Cock in [[London]] in 1797. The use of the fan was not limited to women, as men also carried fans and learned how to convey messages with them. For instance, placing the fan near the heart meant "I love you", while opening a fan wide meant "Wait for me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avictorian.com/fanlanguage.html|publisher=Avictorian.com| title=Ladies and their Fans|accessdate= 2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, where the use of fans (called "abanicos") is still very popular today,{{when|date=August 2018}} ladies used them to communicate with suitors or prospective suitors without attracting the notice of their families or [[Chaperone (social)|chaperons]]. This use was highly popular during the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spainforvisitors.com/module-News-display-sid-236.htm|publisher=Spainforvisitors.com| title=The Language of the Fan|accessdate= 2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
People flirt for a variety of reasons. Flirting can indicate an interest in a deeper personal relationship with another person. Some people flirt simply for amusement, with no intention of developing any further relationship. For others, flirting serves a purpose and is employed as a tool to achieve a specific (professional) goal (good salespeople will recognise situations where flirting will help a sale).
 
===Courtship===
{{main|Mating (human)}}
In order to bond and/or to express sexual interest, people flirt. According to [[social anthropologist]] [[Kate Fox]], there are two main types of flirting: flirting just for fun and flirting with further intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html |title=SIRC Guide to flirting |publisher=Sirc.org |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flirting for fun can take place between friends, co-workers, or total strangers that wish to get to know each other. This type of flirting does not intend to lead to sexual intercourse or a romantic relationship, but increases the bonds between two people.

Flirting with intent plays a role in the mate-selection process. The person flirting will send out signals of sexual availability to another, and expects to see the interest returned in order to continue flirting. Flirting can involve non-verbal signs, such as an exchange of glances, hand-touching, and hair-touching; or verbal signs, such as chatting, giving flattering comments, and exchanging telephone numbers in order to initiate further contact. In the 21st century flirting is increasingly taking place in instant messaging and other social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.com/news/local_news/pittsburgh-is-the-flirtiest-city-in-the-country/article_d2877ebc-6d39-5f10-a4da-880d5651d193.html |title=Pittsburgh is the 'flirtiest' city in the country |publisher=Timesonline.com |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flirting may consist of stylized gestures, language, [[body language]], [[Human position|postures]], and [[physiology|physiologic signs]] which act as cues to another person. Among these, at least in [[western culture|Western society]], are:
* smiling at them and/ or holding them close
* [[Kiss#Non-sexual kisses|Blowing a kiss]]
* Casual touches; such as a woman gently touching a man's arm during conversation&lt;ref name="Sexplanations"/&gt;
* [[Conversation]] (e.g. [[banter]], [[small talk]], [[pickup lines]])&lt;ref name="Sexplanations"/&gt;
* Coyness, marked by cute, coquettish shyness or modesty
* [[Eye contact]],&lt;ref name="Sexplanations"/&gt; batting eyelashes, or [[staring]]
* Eyebrow raising
* [[Flattery]] (e.g. regarding beauty, sexual attractiveness)
* [[Footsie (flirting)|Footsie]],&lt;ref name="Sexplanations"&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDGrUQr-60 | title=Flirting | publisher=Sexplanations | date=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; a form of flirtation in which one uses their feet to play with another's
* [[Giggle|Giggling]], or laughing encouragingly at any slight hint of intimacy in the other's behavior
* [[Imitation|Imitating]] or [[Mirroring (psychology)|mirroring]] another's behavior (e.g. taking a drink when the other person takes a drink, changing posture as the other does, etc.)
* Maintaining close proximity, such as during casual talking

==Cultural variations==
Flirting varies a great deal from culture to culture. For example, for many western cultures one very common flirting strategy includes eye contact. However, eye contact can have a very different meaning in some Asian countries, where women might get in trouble if they return a glance to men who stare at them. Furthermore, Chinese and Japanese women are sometimes not expected to initiate eye contact as it could be considered rude and disrespectful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brighthub.com/education/languages/articles/35828.aspx| title=Covert glances and eye contact|publisher=Brighthub.com|accessdate= 2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eugen de Blaas The Flirtation.jpg|thumb|''The Flirtation'' by [[Eugene de Blaas]]. A study of body language: a man flirting]]
The distance between two people is also important when flirting. People from the "contact cultures", such as those in the Mediterranean or Latin America, may feel comfortable with closer proximity, whereas a British or Northern European person may typically need more space. Although touching, especially of the hand or arm, can constitute flirting, touching is also often done without intentions of flirting, particularly in the contact cultures where it forms a natural part of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html| title=SIRC Guide to Flirting|publisher=Sirc.org|accessdate= 2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Biography of Francesco Montemezzano by Claudio Ridolfi.png|thumb|right|Biography of Francesco Montemezzano by Ridolfi]]
'''Francesco Montemezzano'''  or '''Monte Mezzano''' ([[Verona]] 1555–after 1602) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] painter of the late-[[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] or [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] period.

He was born near [[Verona]], and appears to have been a follower, if not a pupil, of [[Paolo Veronese]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/437146 Metropolitan Museum Collections].&lt;/ref&gt; He was active both in Venice and the mainland, painting mainly sacred subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/francesco-montemezzano_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ Enciclopedia Treccani], Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 76 (2012), entry by Giorgio Tagliaferro&lt;/ref&gt;

He completed some of the panels for the church of [[San Nicolo dei Mendicoli, Venice|San Nicolò dei Mendicoli]]. [[Claudio Ridolfi|Ridolfi]] in a short biography notes that Francesco ''gave himself excessively to the pleasures of love, fell in love with expensive objects'' and this led to an early death by poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lemaravigliedell02rido#page/334/mode/2up Le Maraviglie dell'arte: overo le vite de gl'illustri pittori Veneti], Volume 2, By Carlo Ridolfi, 1648, page 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
He was featured in the BBC One television programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' on 19 July 2015, in which a painting in an English church, [[St John the Baptist's Church, Tunstall]], Lancashire, was verified as being by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b063cy0z/fake-or-fortune-series-4-3-a-mystery-old-master&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gauthier de Costes, seigneur de la Calprenède''' (1609 or 1610 – 1663) was a French [[novelist]] and [[dramatist]].  He was born at the Château of Tolgou in [[Salignac-Eyvigues]] ([[Dordogne]]). After studying at [[Toulouse]], he came to [[Paris]] and entered the regiment of the guards, becoming in 1650 gentleman-in-ordinary of the royal household. He died in 1663 in consequence of a kick from his horse.

La Calprenède was the author of several long heroic romances ridiculed by [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]. They are: ''Cassandre'' (5 vols., 1642–1650); ''Cléopâtre'' (1648); ''Faramond'' (1661); and ''Les Nouvelles, ou les Divertissements de la princesse Alcidiane'' (1661) published under his wife's name, but generally attributed to him.

Some cultures have specific gender roles that are distinct from "man" and "woman," such as the [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijras]] of [[South Asia]]. These are often referred to as ''[[third gender]]s''.

[[Sexology|Sexologist]] [[John Money]] introduced the terminological distinction between [[Sex and gender distinction|biological sex and gender as a role]] in 1955. Before his work, it was uncommon to use the word ''gender'' to refer to anything but [[grammatical gender|grammatical categories]].&lt;ref name=udry /&gt;&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt; However, Money's meaning of the word did not become widespread until the 1970s, when [[feminist theory]] embraced the concept of a distinction between biological sex and the [[Social construction of gender difference|social construct of gender]]. Today, the distinction is followed in some contexts, especially the social sciences&lt;ref name="socialsciencedictionary"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.socialsciencedictionary.com/GENDER| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202125938/http://www.socialsciencedictionary.com/GENDER| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2 February 2011| title=GENDER| publisher=Social Science Dictionary| accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pearsonhighered"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender Roles: A Sociological Perspective|author=Lindsey, Linda L.|isbn=978-0-13-244830-7|year=2010|publisher=Pearson|chapter=Ch. 1.

In other contexts, including some areas of the social sciences, ''gender'' includes ''sex'' or replaces it.&lt;ref name="udry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt; For instance, in non-human animal research, ''gender'' is commonly used to refer to the biological sex of the animals.&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt; This [[Semantic change|change in the meaning]] of gender can be traced to the 1980s. In 1993, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) started to use ''gender'' instead of ''sex''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126835.pdf|title=Guideline for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 2011, the FDA reversed its position and began using ''sex ''as the biological classification and ''gender'' as "a person's self representation as male or female, or how that person is responded to by social institutions based on the individual's gender presentation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm283453.htm|title = Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff Evaluation of Sex Differences in Medical Device Clinical Studies|date = 19 December 2011|accessdate = 3 August 2014|website = U.S. Food and Drug Administration|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[social science]]s have a branch devoted to [[gender studies]]. Other sciences, such as [[sexology]] and [[neuroscience]], are also interested in the subject. The social sciences sometimes approach gender as a [[Social constructionism|social construct]], and gender studies particularly do, while research in the [[natural science]]s investigates whether [[sex differences in humans|biological differences]] in males and females influence the development of gender in humans; both inform debate about how far biological differences influence the formation of gender identity. In some English literature, there is also a trichotomy between biological sex, psychological gender, and social gender role. This framework first appeared in a feminist paper on [[transsexualism]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1978|title=Transsexualism and women: A critical perspective|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=4|issue=3|pages=97–106|doi=10.2307/3177542|jstor=3177542|author=Yudkin, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and usage ==
The modern English word ''gender'' comes from the [[Middle English]] ''gender'', ''gendre'', a [[loanword]] from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Middle French]] ''gendre''. This, in turn, came from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:genus#Latin|genus]]''. Both words mean "kind", "type", or "sort". They derive ultimately from a widely attested [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) [[Root (linguistics)|root]] ''g&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;n-'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Pokorny|Pokorny, Julius]] (1959, reprinted in 1989) [https://web.archive.org/web/20071113165848/http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=leiden&amp;morpho=0&amp;basename=%5Cdata%5Cie%5Cpokorny&amp;first=651 'gen'], in ''Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch'', Bern: Francke, pp. 373–375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE143.html 'gen&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;-'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704184247/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE143.html |date=4 July 2007 }}, in 'Appendix I: Indo-European Roots', to ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', Fourth Edition, (Boston: [[Houghton Mifflin]] Company, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
which is also the source of ''kin'', ''kind'', ''king'', and many other English words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/ahd/roots/zzg00600.html 'Gen']. Your Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; It appears in Modern [[French language|French]] in the word ''[[genre]]'' (type, kind, also ''[[:fr:genre sexuel|genre sexuel]]'') and is related to the [[Greek language|Greek]] root ''gen-'' (to produce), appearing in ''[[gene]]'', ''[[wikt:genesis|genesis]]'', and ''[[oxygen]]''. The Oxford Etymological Dictionary of the English Language of 1882 defined ''gender'' as ''kind, breed, sex'', derived from the Latin ablative case of ''genus'', like ''genere natus'', which refers to birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00skeauoft/page/n5|title=An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language|last=Skeat|first=Walter William|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1882|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED1, Volume 4, 1900) notes the original meaning of ''gender'' as "kind" had already become obsolete.

The word was still widely used, however, in the specific sense of [[grammatical gender]] (the assignment of nouns to categories such as ''masculine'', ''feminine'' and ''neuter''). According to [[Aristotle]], this concept was introduced by the Greek philosopher [[Protagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rhetoric |author=Aristotle |authorlink=Aristotle |translator-last=Roberts |translator-first=William Rhys |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_IMCohto0YC&amp;pg=PA127 |date=2004 |orig-year=1st pub. [[Modern Library]] NY, 1954 |publisher=[[Dover Publications|Dover]] |location=Mineola, NY |isbn=978-0-486-43793-4 |oclc=55616891 |quote=A fourth rule is to observe Protagoras' classification of nouns into male, female and inanimate.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1926, [[Henry Watson Fowler]] stated that the definition of the word pertained to this grammar-related meaning: {{quote|"Gender...is a grammatical term only. To talk of persons...of the masculine or feminine g[ender], meaning of the male or female sex, is either a jocularity (permissible or not according to context) or a blunder."&lt;ref&gt;[[Fowler's Modern English Usage]], 1926: p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The modern academic sense of the word, in the context of social roles of men and women, dates at least back to 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/77468 |title=''gender'', n. |page=Sense 3(b) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher=Oxford English Dictionary |access-date=2017-01-05|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was popularized and developed by the feminist movement from the 1970s onwards (see § Feminism theory and gender studies below), which theorizes that human nature is essentially [[epicene]] and social distinctions based on sex are arbitrarily constructed. In this context, matters pertaining to this theoretical process of [[Social construction of gender|social construction]] were labelled matters of ''gender''.

The popular use of ''gender'' simply as an alternative to ''sex'' (as a biological category) is also widespread, although attempts are still made to preserve the distinction. The [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]] (2000) uses the following two sentences to illustrate the difference, noting that the distinction "is useful in principle, but it is by no means widely observed, and considerable variation in usage occurs at all levels."&lt;ref name="difference"&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/59/G0075900.html Usage note: ''Gender'',] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321144225/http://bartleby.com/61/59/G0075900.html |date=21 March 2006 }} ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition, (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last two decades of the 20th century, the use of ''gender'' in academia has increased greatly, outnumbering uses of ''sex'' in the social sciences. While the spread of the word in science publications can be attributed to the influence of feminism, its use as a synonym for sex is attributed to the failure to grasp the distinction made in feminist theory, and the distinction has sometimes become blurred with the theory itself; [[David Haig]] stated, "Among the reasons that working scientists have given me for choosing gender rather than sex in biological contexts are desires to signal sympathy with feminist goals, to use a more academic term, or to avoid the connotation of copulation."&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt;

In legal cases alleging [[discrimination]], ''sex'' is usually preferred as the determining factor rather than ''gender'' as it refers to biology rather than socially constructed [[norm (sociology)|norms]] which are more open to interpretation and dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Render, Meredith. (2006) "Misogyny, Androgyny, and Sexual Harassment: Sex Discrimination in a Gender-Deconstructed World". ''Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender''. Vol. 29(1) (Winter). pp. 99–150.&lt;/ref&gt; Julie Greenberg writes that although gender and sex are separate concepts, they are interlinked in that [[gender discrimination]] often results from stereotypes based on what is expected of members of each sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenberg | first1 = Julie A | year = 1999 | title = Defining Male and Female: Intersexuality and the Collision Between Law and Biology | url = | journal = Arizona Law Review | volume = 41 | issue = | page = 265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[J.E.B. v.

''Gender identity'' refers to a personal identification with a particular gender and gender role in society. The term ''[[woman]]'' has historically been used interchangeably with reference to the female body, though more recently this usage has been viewed as controversial by some [[feminist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mikkola, Mari (12 May 2008). [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2012/entries/feminism-gender "Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender."] Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;There are qualitative analyses that explore and present the representations of gender; however, [[feminist]]s challenge these dominant ideologies concerning gender roles and biological sex. One's biological sex is directly tied to specific social roles and the expectations. [[Judith Butler]] considers the concept of being a woman to have more challenges, owing not only to society's viewing women as a social category but also as a felt sense of self, a culturally conditioned or constructed subjective identity.&lt;ref name="Butler 1990"&gt;Butler (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Social identity'' refers to the common identification with a collectivity or social category that creates a common culture among participants concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, D.A. and Oliver, P.E.

Categorizing males and females into [[social role]]s creates a problem, because individuals feel they have to be at one end of a linear spectrum and must identify themselves as man or woman, rather than being allowed to choose a section in between.&lt;ref&gt;Pathak, Sunita, and Pathak, Surendra [https://www.academia.edu/263120/Gender_and_the_MDGs_with_reference_to_women_as_human "Gender and the MDGs with Reference to Women as Human"].

Philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] said that as sexual subjects, humans are the object of power, which is not an institution or structure, rather it is a signifier or name attributed to "complex strategical situation".&lt;ref&gt;Tong, Rosemarie (2009). Feminist thought : a more comprehensive introduction / Rosemarie Tong.Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press {{ISBN|0-8133-4375-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, "power" is what determines individual attributes, behaviors, etc. and people are a part of an ontologically and epistemologically constructed set of names and labels. For example, being female characterizes one as a woman, and being a woman signifies one as weak, emotional, and irrational, and incapable of actions attributed to a "man". Butler said that gender and sex are more like verbs than nouns. She reasoned that her actions are limited because she is female. "I am not permitted to construct my gender and sex willy-nilly," she said.&lt;ref name="Butler 1990" /&gt; "[This] is so because gender is politically and therefore socially controlled. Rather than 'woman' being something one is, it is something one does."&lt;ref name="Butler 1990" /&gt; More recent criticisms of Judith Butler's theories critique her writing for reinforcing the very conventional dichotomies of gender.&lt;ref&gt;Vigo, Julian.

=== Social assignment and gender fluidity ===
{{See also|Sex assignment}}
According to [[gender studies|gender theorist]] [[Kate Bornstein]], gender can have ambiguity and fluidity.&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein, Kate (1995). ''Gender Outlaw – On Men, Women and the rest of us'', Vintage, {{ISBN|0-679-75701-5}} pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; There are two contrasting ideas regarding the definition of gender, and the intersection of both of them is definable as below:

The [[World Health Organization]] defines gender as the result of socially constructed ideas about the behavior, actions, and roles a particular sex performs.&lt;ref name="www.who.int" /&gt; The beliefs, values and attitude taken up and exhibited by them is as per the agreeable norms of the society and the personal opinions of the person is not taken into the primary consideration of assignment of gender and imposition of gender roles as per the assigned gender.&lt;ref name="www.who.int" /&gt; Intersections and crossing of the prescribed boundaries have no place in the arena of the social construct of the term "gender".

The assignment of gender involves taking into account the physiological and biological attributes assigned by nature followed by the imposition of the socially constructed conduct. ''Gender'' is a term used to exemplify the attributes that a society or culture constitutes as "masculine" or "feminine". Although a person's sex as male or female stands as a biological fact that is identical in any culture, what that specific sex means in reference to a person's gender role as a woman or a man in society varies cross culturally according to what things are considered to be masculine or feminine.&lt;ref name="Birke, Lynda 2001"&gt;Birke, Lynda. "Chapter 24, In Pursuit of Difference." The Gender and Science Reader. New York: Routledge, 2001. 309-22. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These roles are learned from various, intersecting sources such as parental influences, the socialization a child receives in school, and what is portrayed in the local media. Learning gender roles starts from birth and includes seemingly simple things like what color outfits a baby is clothed in or what toys they are given to play with. However, a person's gender does not always align with what has been assigned at birth. Factors other than learned behaviors play a role in the development of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ehrensaft|first=Diane|date=25 May 2017|title=Gender nonconforming youth: current perspectives|url=https://www.dovepress.com/gender-nonconforming-youth-current-perspectives-peer-reviewed-article-AHMT|journal=Adolescent Health, Medicine and Therapeutics|language=English|volume= 8|pages=57–67|doi=10.2147/ahmt.s110859|issn=1179-318X|pmc=5448699|pmid=28579848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cultural traits typically coupled to a particular sex finalize the assignment of gender and the biological differences which play a role in classifying either sex as interchangeable with the definition of gender within the social context.

In this context, the socially constructed rules are at a cross road with the assignment of a particular gender to a person. Gender ambiguity deals with having the freedom to choose, manipulate and create a personal niche within any defined socially constructed code of conduct while gender fluidity is outlawing all the rules of cultural gender assignment. It does not accept the prevalence of the two rigidly defined genders "man" and "woman" and believes in freedom to choose any kind of gender with no rules, no defined boundaries and no fulfilling of expectations associated with any particular gender.

Both these definitions are facing opposite directions with their own defined set of rules and criteria on which the said systems are based.

=== Social categories ===

Sexologist John Money [[Neologism|coined the term]] ''gender role'' in 1955. The term ''[[gender role]]'' is defined as the actions or responses that may reveal their status as boy, man, girl or woman, respectively.&lt;ref name="j1"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1955|title=Hermaphroditism, gender and precocity in hyperadrenocorticism: Psychologic findings|journal=Bulletin of the Johns Hopkins Hospital|volume=96|issue=6|pages=253–264|pmid=14378807|last1=Money|first1=J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements surrounding gender roles include clothing, speech patterns, movement, occupations, and other factors not limited to biological sex. In contrast to taxonomic approaches, some feminist philosophers have argued that gender "is a vast orchestration of subtle mediations between oneself and others", rather than a "private cause behind manifest behaviours".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Laurie|first=Timothy|title=The Ethics of Nobody I Know: Gender and the Politics of Description|url=https://www.academia.edu/6262250|year=2014|journal=Qualitative Research Journal|volume=14|issue=1|pages=64–78|doi=10.1108/qrj-03-2014-0011|hdl=10453/44221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because social aspects of gender can normally be presumed to be the ones of interest in sociology and closely related disciplines, ''gender role'' is often abbreviated to ''gender'' in their literature.

==== Non-binary and third genders ====
{{main|Genderqueer|Third gender}}
Traditionally, most societies have only recognized two distinct, broad classes of gender roles, masculine and feminine, that correspond with the biological sexes of male and female. When a baby is born, society allocates the child to one gender or the other, on the basis of what their genitals resemble.&lt;ref name="Birke, Lynda 2001" /&gt; However, some societies explicitly incorporate people who adopt the gender role opposite to their biological sex; for example, the [[two-spirit]] people of some indigenous American peoples. Other societies include well-developed roles that are explicitly considered more or less distinct from archetypal female and male roles in those societies. In the language of the [[sociology of gender]], they comprise a [[third gender]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor=Gilbert Herdt | title=Third Sex Third Gender: Beyond Sexual Dimorphism in Culture and History | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-942299-82-3 | oclc=35293440}}&lt;/ref&gt; more or less distinct from biological sex (sometimes the basis for the role does include intersexuality or incorporates [[eunuch]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Will Roscoe, ''Changing Ones: Third and Fourth Genders in Native North America'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2000. {{ISBN|0-312-22479-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(Worlds of Desire: The Chicago Series on Sexuality, Gender, and Culture), University Of Chicago Press (1 July 2005). {{ISBN|0-226-70756-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example may be the [[muxe]] (pronounced {{IPA-oax|ˈmuʃe|}}), found in the state of Oaxaca, in southern Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/weekinreview/07lacey.html "A lifestyle distinct: the Muxe of Mexico,"] ''New York Times'', 6 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bugis]] people of [[Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]] have [[Gender in Bugis society|a tradition]] that incorporates all the features above.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Sharyn (April–June 2001) [http://www.insideindonesia.org/edit66/bissu2.htm Sulawesi's Fifth Gender] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618180935/http://www.insideindonesia.org/edit66/bissu2.htm |date=18 June 2006 }}. ''Inside Indonesia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these traditionally recognized third genders, many cultures now recognize, to differing degrees, various [[genderqueer|non-binary gender identities]]. People who are non-binary (or genderqueer) have gender identities that are not exclusively masculine or feminine. They may identify as having an overlap of gender identities, having two or more genders, having no gender, having a fluctuating gender identity, or being third gender or other-gendered. Recognition of non-binary genders is still somewhat new to mainstream Western culture,&lt;ref&gt;McGee, R. Jon and Richard L. Warms (2011). Anthropological Theory: An Introductory History. New York, McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; and non-binary people may face increased risk of assault, harassment, and discrimination.&lt;ref name="Harrison2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jack Harrison |author2=Jaime Grant |author3=Jody L.

[[Joan Roughgarden]] argues that some non-human animal species also have more than two genders, in that there might be multiple templates for behavior available to individual organisms with a given biological sex.&lt;ref&gt;Roughgarden, Joan (2004) ''Evolution's Rainbow: Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People''. [[University of California Press]]. {{ISBN|0-520-24073-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measurement of gender identity ===
Early gender identity research hypothesized a single bipolar dimension of masculinity-femininity, with masculinity and femininity being opposites on one continuum. Assumptions of the unidimensional model were challenged as societal stereotypes changed, which led to the development of a two-dimensional gender identity model. In the model, masculinity and femininity were conceptualized as two separate and orthogonal dimensions, coexisting in varying degrees within an individual. This conceptualization on femininity and masculinity remains the accepted standard today.&lt;ref name=palan /&gt;

Two instruments incorporating the multidimensional nature of masculinity and femininity have dominated gender identity research: The Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) and the [[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]] (PAQ). Both instruments categorize individuals as either being sex typed (males report themselves as identifying primarily with masculine traits, females report themselves as identifying primarily with feminine traits), cross sex-typed (males report themselves as identifying primarily with feminine traits, females report themselves as identifying primarily with masculine traits), androgynous (either males or females who report themselves as high on both masculine and feminine traits) or undifferentiated (either males or females who report themselves as low on both masculine and feminine traits).&lt;ref name=palan&gt;{{cite journal|author=Palan, K. |year=2001 |url=http://www.amsreview.org/articles/palan10-2001.pdf |title=Gender Identity in Consumer Research: A Literature Review and Research Agenda |journal=Academy of Marketing Science Review |volume=10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911204513/http://www.amsreview.org/articles/palan10-2001.pdf |archivedate=11 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenge (1997) noted that men are generally more masculine than women and women generally more feminine than men, but the association between biological sex and masculinity/femininity is waning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1997|title=Changes in masculine and feminine traits over time: A meta-analysis|journal=Sex Roles|volume=36|issue=5–6|pages=305–325|doi=10.1007/BF02766650|last1=Twenge|first1=Jean M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist theory and gender studies ===
{{Feminist philosophy sidebar}}
Biologist and feminist academic [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] rejects the discourse of biological versus social determinism and advocates a deeper analysis of how interactions between the biological being and the social environment influence individuals' capacities.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Fausto-Sterling (1992) ''Myths of Gender: Biological Theories about Men and Women''. New York: Basic Books. p. 8 {{ISBN|0-465-04792-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher and feminist [[Simone de Beauvoir]] applied [[existentialism]] to women's experience of life: "One is not born a woman, one becomes one."&lt;ref&gt;de Beauvoir, Simone (1949) ''The Second Sex''."&lt;/ref&gt; In context, this is a philosophical statement. However, it may be analyzed in terms of biology—a girl must pass [[puberty]] to become a woman—and sociology, as a great deal of mature relating in social contexts is learned rather than instinctive.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling (2000) Chapter 3 "Of Gender and Genitals", pp. 44–77&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[feminist theory]], terminology for gender issues developed over the 1970s. In the 1974 edition of ''Masculine/Feminine or Human'', the author uses "innate gender" and "learned sex roles",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Chafetz, J.S. | title=Masculine/Feminine or Human? An Overview of the Sociology of Sex Roles | location=Itasca, Illinois | publisher=F.E. Peacock | year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the 1978 edition, the use of ''sex'' and ''gender'' is reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Chafetz, J.S. | title=Masculine/Feminine or Human?

By 1980, most feminist writings had agreed on using ''gender'' only for socioculturally adapted [[trait theory|traits]].

In [[gender studies]] the term ''gender'' refers to proposed social and cultural constructions of masculinities and femininities. In this context, ''gender'' explicitly excludes reference to biological differences, to focus on cultural differences.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, Stephanie (1992). [https://books.google.com/books?id=WMoNAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Gender''], Routledge p. vii {{ISBN|0-422-60570-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This emerged from a number of different areas: in sociology during the 1950s; from the theories of the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan#Lacan and his discontents|Jacques Lacan]]; and in the work of French psychoanalysts like [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Luce Irigaray]], and American feminists such as [[Judith Butler]]. Those who followed Butler came to regard gender roles as a practice, sometimes referred to as "[[performative]]".&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1990) p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles E. Hurst states that some people think sex will, "...automatically determine one's gender demeanor and role (social) as well as one's [[sexual orientation]] (sexual attractions and behavior).&lt;ref name="Hurst141" /&gt; Gender sociologists believe that people have [[cultural]] origins and habits for dealing with gender. For example, Michael Schwalbe believes that humans must be taught how to act appropriately in their designated gender to fill the role properly, and that the way people behave as masculine or feminine interacts with social expectations. Schwalbe comments that humans "are the results of many people embracing and acting on similar ideas".&lt;ref&gt;Schwalbe, M. (2005). The Sociologically Examined Life: Pieces of the Conversation Third Edition.  pp. 22–23 {{ISBN|0-07-282579-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; People do this through everything from [[clothing]] and hairstyle to relationship and employment choices. Schwalbe believes that these distinctions are important, because society wants to identify and categorize people as soon as we see them. They need to place people into distinct categories to know how we should feel about them.

Hurst comments that in a society where we present our genders so distinctly, there can often be severe consequences for breaking these cultural norms. Many of these consequences are rooted in [[discrimination]] based on sexual orientation. Gays and lesbians are often discriminated against in our legal system because of societal prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, N. and Stanley, E. (2011). Captive Genders. 1st ed. Edinburgh: AK Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Center for American Progress, (2016). Unjust: How The Broken Criminal Justice System Fails LGBT People. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lydon et al., "Coming Out of Concrete Closets: A Report on Black &amp; Pink's National LGBTQ Prisoner Survey."&lt;/ref&gt;  Hurst describes how this discrimination works against people for breaking gender norms, no matter what their sexual orientation is. He says that "courts often confuse sex, gender, and sexual orientation, and confuse them in a way that results in denying the rights not only of gays and lesbians, but also of those who do not present themselves or act in a manner traditionally expected of their sex".&lt;ref name="Hurst141"&gt;Hurst, C. (2007) ''Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences''. 6th Edition. pp. 131, 139–142&lt;/ref&gt; This prejudice plays out in our legal system when a person is judged differently because they do not present themselves as the "correct" gender.

[[Andrea Dworkin]] stated her "commitment to destroying male dominance and gender itself" while stating her belief in [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Andrea (1995). "My Life as a Writer", pp.&amp;nbsp;33–34 in Dworkin, Andrea ''Life and Death: Unapologetic Writings on the Continuing War Against Women''. New York: Free Press. {{ISBN|0-7432-3626-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist [[Mary Hawkesworth]] addresses gender and feminist theory, stating that since the 1970s the concept of gender has transformed and been used in significantly different ways within feminist scholarship. She notes that a transition occurred when several feminist scholars, such as [[Sandra Harding]] and [[Joan Wallach Scott|Joan Scott]], began to conceive of gender "as an analytic category within which humans think about and organize their social activity". Feminist scholars in [[Political Science]] began employing gender as an analytical category, which highlighted "social and political relations neglected by mainstream accounts". However, Hawkesworth states "feminist political science has not become a dominant paradigm within the discipline".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawkesworth|first=Mary|year=2005|title=Engendering political science: An immodest proposal|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=1|issue=1|pages=141–156|doi=10.1017/s1743923x0523101x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American political scientist Karen Beckwith addresses the concept of gender within political science arguing that a "common language of gender" exists and that it must be explicitly articulated in order to build upon it within the political science discipline. Beckwith describes two ways in which the political scientist may employ 'gender' when conducting empirical research: "gender as a category and as a process." Employing gender as a category allows for political scientists "to delineate specific contexts where behaviours, actions, attitudes and preferences considered masculine or feminine result in particular" political outcomes. It may also demonstrate how gender differences, not necessarily corresponding precisely with sex, may "constrain or facilitate political" actors. Gender as a process has two central manifestations in political science research, firstly in determining "the differential effects of structures and policies upon men and women," and secondly, the ways in which masculine and feminine political actors "actively work to produce favorable gendered outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karen|first=Beckwith|title=A Common Language of Gender?|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|year=2005|volume=1|issue=1|page=132|doi=10.1017/s1743923x05211017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to gender studies, Jacquetta Newman states that although sex is determined biologically, the ways in which people express gender is not. Gendering is a socially constructed process based on culture, though often cultural expectations around women and men have a direct relationship to their biology.  Because of this, Newman argues, many privilege sex as being a cause of oppression and ignore other issues like race, ability, poverty, etc. Current gender studies classes seek to move away from that and examine the intersectionality of these factors in determining people's lives. She also points out that other non-Western cultures do not necessarily have the same views of gender and gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women, Politics, and Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women, 2nd ed|last=White|first=Linda|publisher=Oxford Press|year=1964|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman also debates the meaning of equality, which is often considered the goal of feminism; she believes that ''equality'' is a problematic term because it can mean many different things, such as people being treated identically, differently, or fairly based on their gender. Newman believes this is problematic because there is no unified definition as to what equality means or looks like, and that this can be significantly important in areas like public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women, Politics, and Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women, 2nd ed|last=White|first=Linda|publisher=Oxford Press|year=1964|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social construction of sex hypotheses ===
{{See also|Sex and gender distinction}}
[[File:WomanFactory1940s.jpg|thumb|"[[Rosie the Riveter]]" was an iconic symbol of the American [[Home front during World War II|homefront]] in [[World War II|WWII]] and a departure from [[gender role]]s due to [[Total war|wartime necessity]].]]
Sociologists generally regard gender as a social construct, and various researchers, including many [[Feminism|feminists]], consider sex to only be a matter of biology and something that is not about social or cultural construction. For instance, [[Sexology|sexologist]] [[John Money]] suggests the distinction between biological sex and gender as a role.&lt;ref name=j1 /&gt; Moreover, [[Ann Oakley]], a professor of sociology and social policy, says "the constancy of sex must be admitted, but so also must the variability of gender."&lt;ref&gt;Oakley, Ann (1972). ''Sex, Gender and Society''. London: Temple Smith. p. 16 {{ISBN|0-85117-020-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] states, "'[s]ex' refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that define men and women," and "'gender' refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women."&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2002). "[http://www.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/ Gender and Reproductive Rights: Working Definitions]". Retrieved 15 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, sex is regarded as a category studied in biology (natural sciences), while gender is studied in [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. Lynda Birke, a feminist biologist, maintains "'biology' is not seen as something which might change."&lt;ref&gt;Birke, Lynda (2001). "In Pursuit of Difference: Scientific Studies of Women and Men," Muriel Lederman and Ingrid Bartsch eds., ''The Gender and Science Reader'', New York: Routledge. p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is stated that sex is something that does not change, while gender can change according to social structure.

However, there are scholars who argue that sex is also socially constructed. For example, gender theorist [[Judith Butler]] states that "perhaps this construct called 'sex' is as culturally constructed as gender; indeed, perhaps it was always already gender, with the consequence that the distinction between sex and gender turns out to be no distinction at all."&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1990) p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
She continues:&lt;blockquote&gt;It would make no sense, then, to define gender as the cultural interpretation of sex, if sex is itself a gender-centered category. Gender should not be conceived merely as the cultural inscription of meaning based on a given sex (a juridical conception); gender must also designate the very apparatus of production whereby the sexes themselves are established. [...] This production of sex as the pre-discursive should be understood as the effect of the apparatus of cultural construction designated by gender.&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1990) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Butler argues that "bodies only appear, only endure, only live within the productive constraints of certain highly gendered regulatory schemas,"&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1993) p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; and sex is "no longer as a bodily given on which the construct of gender is artificially imposed, but as a cultural norm which governs the materialization of bodies."&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1993) pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Marria Lugones states that, among the [[Yoruba people]], there was no concept of gender and no gender system at all before [[colonialism]]. She argues that colonial powers used a gender system as a tool for domination and fundamentally changing social relations among the indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lugones|first=María|date=Winter 2008|title=Heterosexualism and the Colonial/Modern Gender System|journal=Hypatia|volume=22|issue=1|pages=196–198|doi=10.1353/hyp.2006.0067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to history, Linda Nicholson, a professor of history and [[women's studies]], says that the notion of human bodies being separated into two sexes is not historically consistent. She argues that male and female genitals were considered inherently the same in Western society until the 18th century. At that time, female genitals were regarded as incomplete male genitals, and the difference between the two was conceived as a matter of degree. In other words, there was a gradation of physical forms, or a spectrum. Therefore, the current perspective toward sex, which is to consider women and men and their typical genitalia as the only possible natural options, came into existence through historical, not biological roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1994 |title="Interpreting Gender". Signs |journal=Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=79–105 |doi=10.1086/494955 |jstor=3174928 |author=Nicholson, Linda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, drawing from the empirical research of [[intersex]] children, [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]], a professor of biology and [[gender studies]], describes how the doctors address the issues of intersexuality. She starts her argument with an example of the birth of an intersexual individual and maintains "our conceptions of the nature of gender difference shape, even as they reflect, the ways we structure our social system and polity; they also shape and reflect our understanding of our physical bodies."&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling (2000) p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Then she adds how gender assumptions affects the scientific study of sex by presenting the research of intersexuals by John Money et al., and she concludes that "they never questioned the fundamental assumption that there are only two sexes, because their goal in studying intersexuals was to find out more about 'normal' development."&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling (2000) p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; She also mentions the language the doctors use when they talk with the parents of the intersexuals. After describing how the doctors inform parents about the intersexuality, she asserts that because the doctors believe that the intersexuals are actually male or female, they tell the parents of the intersexuals that it will take a little bit more time for the doctors to determine whether the infant is a boy or a girl. That is to say, the doctors' behavior is formulated by the cultural gender assumption that there are only two sexes. Lastly, she maintains that the differences in the ways in which the medical professionals in different regions treat intersexual people also give us a good example of how sex is socially constructed.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling, Anne 2000"&gt;Fausto-Sterling (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In her ''Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality'', she introduces the following example:&lt;blockquote&gt; A group of physicians from Saudi Arabia recently reported on several cases of XX intersex children with [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH), a genetically inherited malfunction of the [[enzyme]]s that aid in making [[steroid hormones]]. [...] In the United States and Europe, such children, because they have the potential to bear children later in life, are usually raised as girls. Saudi doctors trained in this European tradition recommended such a course of action to the Saudi parents of CAH XX children. A number of parents, however, refused to accept the recommendation that their child, initially identified as a son, be raised instead as a daughter. Nor would they accept feminizing surgery for their child. [...] This was essentially an expression of local community attitudes with [...] the preference for male offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling (2000) pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus it may be said that determining the sex of children is actually a cultural act, and the sex of children is in fact socially constructed.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling, Anne 2000" /&gt; Therefore, it is possible that although sex seems fixed and only related to biology, it may be actually deeply related to historical and social factors as well as biology and other natural sciences.

Another work of Ann Fausto-Sterling's in which she discusses gender is ''The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough.'' In this article, Fausto-Sterling states that Western culture has only two sexes and that even their language restricts the presence of more than two sexes. She argues that instead of having a binomial nomenclature for organizing humans into two distinct sexes (male and female), there are at least five sexes in the broad spectrum of gender. These five sexes include male, female, hermaphrodite, female [[pseudohermaphrodites]] (individuals who have ovaries and some male genitalia but lack testes), and male pseudohermaphrodites (individuals who have testes and some female genitalia but lack ovaries). Fausto-Sterling additionally adds that in the category of hermaphrodites, there are additional degrees and levels in which the genitalia are developed; this means that there may be more intersexes that exist in this continuum of gender.

Fausto-Sterling argues that sex has been gradually institutionally disciplined into a binary system through medical advances. She brings up multiple instances where gender in history was not split into strictly male or female, Fausto-Sterling mentioned that by the end of the Middle Age, intersex individuals were forced to pick a side in the binary gender code and to adhere by it. She then adds on that "hermaphrodites have unruly bodies" and they need to fit into society's definition of gender.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ridgeway|first1=Cecilia L.|last2=Correll|first2=Shelley J.|title=Unpacking the Gender System: A Theoretical Perspective on Gender Beliefs and Social Relations|jstor=4149448|volume=18|issue=4|pages=510–531|doi=10.1177/0891243204265269|journal=Gender|year=2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, modern-day parents have been urged by medical doctors to decide the sex for their hermaphroditic child immediately after childbirth. She emphasizes that the role of the medical community is that of an institutionalized discipline on society that there can only be two sexes: male and female and only the two listed are considered "normal." Lastly, Fausto-Sterling argues that modern laws require humans to be labelled either as male or female and that "ironically, a more sophisticated knowledge of the complexity of sexual systems has led to the repression of such intricacy."&lt;ref name="jstor.org" /&gt; She mentions this quote to inform the prevailing thought that hermaphrodites, without medical intervention, are assumed to live a life full of psychological pain when in fact, there is no evidence in which that is the case. She finishes up her argument asking what would happen if society started accepting intersex individuals.

The article ''Adolescent Gender-Role Identity and Mental Health: Gender Intensification Revisited'' focuses on the work of Heather A. Priess, Sara M. Lindberg, and [[Janet Shibley Hyde]] on whether or not girls and boys diverge in their gender identities during adolescent years. The researchers based their work on ideas previously mentioned by Hill and Lynch in their gender intensification hypothesis in that signals and messages from parents determine and affect their children's [[gender role]] identities. This hypothesis argues that parents affect their children's gender role identities and that different interactions spent with either parents will affect gender intensification. Priess and among other's study did not support the hypothesis of Hill and Lynch which stated "that as adolescents experience these and other socializing influences, they will become more stereotypical in their gender-role identities and gendered attitudes and behaviors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Priess|first1=Heather A.|last2=Lindberg|first2=Sara M.|last3=Hyde|first3=Janet Shibley|title=Adolescent Gender-Role Identity and Mental Health: Gender Intensification Revisited|jstor=25592088|volume=80|issue=5|pages=1531–1544|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01349.x|journal=Child Development|pmc=4244905|pmid=19765016|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the researchers did state that perhaps the hypothesis Hill and Lynch proposed was true in the past but is not true now due to changes in the population of teens in respect to their gender-role identities.

Authors of ''Unpacking the Gender System: A Theoretical Perspective on Gender Belief’s and Social Relations'', Cecilia Ridgeway and Shelley Correll, argue that gender is more than an identity or role but is something that is institutionalized through "social relational contexts." Ridgeway and Correll define "social relational contexts" as "any situation in which individuals define themselves in relation to others in order to act."&lt;ref name="Wiley"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ridgeway|first1=Cecilia L.|last2=Correll|first2=Shelley J.|title=Unpacking the Gender System: A Theoretical Perspective on Gender Beliefs and Social Relations|jstor=4149448|volume=18|issue=4|pages=510–531|doi=10.1177/0891243204265269|journal=Gender|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also point out that in addition to social relational contexts, cultural beliefs plays a role in the gender system. The coauthors argue that daily people are forced to acknowledge and interact with others in ways that are related to gender. Every day, individuals are interacting with each other and comply with society's set standard of [[hegemonic]] beliefs, which includes gender roles. They state that society's hegemonic cultural beliefs sets the rules which in turn create the setting for which social relational contexts are to take place. Ridgeway and Correll then shift their topic towards sex categorization. The authors define sex categorization as "the sociocognitive process by which we label another as male or female."&lt;ref name="Wiley" /&gt;

In most cases, men and women and boys and girls are similar in behavior, with little gender difference, but some gendered behavior is influenced by prenatal and early life androgen exposure. This includes, for example, gender normative play, self-identification with a gender, and tendency to engage in aggressive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hines|first1=Melissa|last2=Constantinescu|first2=Mihaela|last3=Spencer|first3=Debra|title=Early androgen exposure and human gender development|journal=Biology of Sex Differences|date=26 February 2015|volume=6|pages=3|doi=10.1186/s13293-015-0022-1|pmc=4350266|issn=2042-6410|pmid=25745554}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males of most mammals, including humans, exhibit more rough and tumble play behavior, which is influenced by maternal testosterone levels. These levels may also influence sexuality, with non-heterosexual persons exhibiting sex atypical behavior in childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hines|first1=Melissa|title=Prenatal endocrine influences on sexual orientation and on sexually differentiated childhood behavior|journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology|date=6 February 2017|volume=32|issue=2|pages=170–182|doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.006|pmc=3296090|issn=0091-3022|pmid=21333673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sexual dimorphism#Psychological and behavioral differentiation|biology of gender]] became the subject of an expanding number of studies over the course of the late 20th century. One of the earliest areas of interest was what became known as "gender identity disorder" (GID) and which is now also described as [[gender dysphoria]]. Studies in this, and related areas, inform the following summary of the subject by John Money. He stated:

{{quote|The term "gender role" appeared in print first in 1955. The term ''gender identity'' was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. The definitions of gender and gender identity vary on a doctrinal basis. In popularized and scientifically debased usage, sex is what you are biologically; gender is what you become socially; gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness; and gender role is the cultural stereotype of what is masculine and feminine. Causality with respect to gender identity disorder is sub-divisible into genetic, prenatal hormonal, postnatal social, and post-pubertal hormonal determinants, but there is, as yet, no comprehensive and detailed theory of causality. Gender coding in the brain is bipolar. In gender identity disorder, there is discordance between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7996589|year=1994|last1=Money|first1=J|title=The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years|volume=20|issue=3|pages=163–177|doi=10.1080/00926239408403428|journal=Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Money refers to attempts to distinguish a difference between biological sex and social gender as "scientifically debased", because of our increased knowledge of a continuum of [[sexual dimorphism|dimorphic]] features (Money's word is "dipolar") that link biological and behavioral differences. These extend from the exclusively biological "genetic" and "prenatal hormonal" differences between men and women, to "postnatal" features, some of which are social, but others have been shown to result from "post-pubertal hormonal" effects.

Although causation from the biological—[[Genetics|genetic]] and [[Sex steroids|hormonal]]—to the behavioral has been broadly demonstrated and accepted, Money is careful to also note that understanding of the causal chains from biology to behavior in sex and gender issues is very far from complete. For example, the existence of a "[[Biology and sexual orientation|gay gene]]" has not been proven, but such a gene remains an acknowledged possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Abrams, [http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jun/born-gay/article_view?b_start:int=0&amp;-C= 'The Real Story on Gay Genes: Homing in on the science of homosexuality—and sexuality itself',] ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' '''June''' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are studies concerning women who have a condition called [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], which leads to the overproduction of the masculine sex [[hormone]], [[androgen]]. These women usually have ordinary female appearances (though nearly all girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) have corrective surgery performed on their genitals). However, despite taking hormone-balancing medication given to them at birth, these females are statistically more likely to be interested in activities traditionally linked to males than female activities. Psychology professor and CAH researcher Dr. Sheri Berenbaum attributes these differences to an exposure of higher levels of male sex hormones in utero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Beattie-Moss | first = Melissa | authorlink =  | title = Are gender differences predetermined? | website =  | publisher = [[Penn State]] | date = 8 June 2005 | url = http://www.rps.psu.edu/probing/gender.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060113080145/http://www.rps.psu.edu/probing/gender.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 13 January 2006 | doi =  | accessdate = 30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender taxonomy ===
The following [[gender taxonomy]] illustrates the kinds of diversity that have been studied and reported in medical literature. It is placed in roughly chronological order of biological and social development in the human [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. The earlier stages are more purely biological and the latter are more dominantly social. Causation is known to operate from chromosome to gonads, and from gonads to hormones. It is also significant from brain structure to gender identity (see Money quote above). Brain structure and processing (biological) that may explain erotic preference (social), however, is an area of ongoing research. Terminology in some areas changes quite rapidly as knowledge grows.
* [[chromosome]]s: 46,XX ([[Female|genetic female]]); 46,XY ([[Male|genetic male]]) ;45,X ([[Turner's syndrome]]); 47,XXY ([[Klinefelter syndrome]]); 47,XYY ([[XYY syndrome]]); 47,XXX ([[XXX syndrome]]); 48,XXYY ([[XXYY syndrome]]); 46,XX/XY [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]]; other mosaic;
* [[gonad]]s: [[testicle]]s; [[ovary|ovaries]]; ovarian and testicular tissues, not in same gonad ([[true hermaphroditism]]), [[Ovotestis|ovotestes]], or other [[gonadal dysgenesis]];
* [[hormone]]s: [[androgen]]s (including [[testosterone]], [[dihydrotestosterone]], etc.), [[estrogen]]s (including [[estradiol]], [[estriol]], etc.), [[antiandrogen]]s, [[progestogen]]s, and [[List of human hormones|others]];
* [[Sex organ|primary sexual characteristics]]: [[Sex organ#External and internal organs|genitals]] [http://www.dsdguidelines.org/htdocs/parents/handout_genital_development.html (genital development)];
* [[Secondary sex characteristic#In humans|secondary sexual characteristics]]: dimorphic physical characteristics, other than primary characteristics (such as [[Androgenic hair|body hair]], development of [[breast]]s); certain changes in brain structure due to organizing effects of sex hormones [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195165 (Is it useful to view the brain as a secondary sexual characteristic?)];
* [[gender identity]]: one’s sense of oneself as a [[man]], [[woman]], or [[Gender variance|gender non-conforming]];
* [[gender expression]]: presentation and behaviors that express aspects of gender identity or [[gender role]]

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
{{See also|Sexual differentiation|Sexual dimorphism|Sex differences in humans}}
[[File:Peacock courting peahen.jpg|thumb|Sexual differentiation in [[peafowl]]]]
Although sexual reproduction is ''defined'' at the cellular level, key features of sexual reproduction operate ''within'' the structures of the gamete cells themselves. Notably, gametes carry very long molecules called [[DNA]] that the biological processes of reproduction can "read" like a book of instructions. In fact, there are typically many of these "books", called ''chromosomes''. Human gametes usually have 23 chromosomes, 22 of which are common to both sexes. The final chromosomes in the two human gametes are called ''sex'' chromosomes because of their role in [[Sex-determination systems|sex determination]]. [[Ovum|Ova]] always have the same sex chromosome, labelled ''[[X chromosome|X]]''. About half of [[spermatozoa]] also have this same X chromosome, the rest have a [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]]. At fertilization the gametes fuse to form a cell, usually with 46 chromosomes, and either XX female or XY male, depending on whether the sperm carried an X or a Y chromosome. Some of the other possibilities are listed [[Gender#Gender taxonomy|above]].

Genes which are specific to the X or Y chromosome are called [[sex-linked genes]]. For example, the genes which create red and green retinal photoreceptors are located on the X chromosome, which men only have one of. Thus [[red-green color blindness]] is an [[X-linked recessive inheritance|X-linked recessive trait]] and is much more common in men. However, [[sex-limited genes]] on ''any'' chromosome can be expressed and "say", for example, "''if'' you are in a male body do X, otherwise do not."

The human [[XY sex-determination system|XY system]] is not the only sex determination system. Birds typically have a reverse, ZW system—males are ZZ and females ZW.&lt;ref&gt;Maria, Lepowsky, and JS Chafetz. "The Encyclopedic Entry of Gender." Reference.com. Dictionary.com, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether male or female birds influence the sex of offspring is not known for all species. Several species of [[butterfly]] are known to have female parent sex determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Sahara|first2=K.|last3=Marec|first3=F.|year=2007|title=Sex Chromosomes and Sex Determination in Lepidoptera|journal=Sexual Development|volume=1|issue=6|pages=332–46|doi=10.1159/000111765|pmid=18391545|quote=The speciose insect order Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) and their closest relatives, Trichoptera (caddis flies), share a female-heterogametic sex chromosome system|last1=Traut|first1=W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[platypus]] has a complex hybrid system, the male has ten sex chromosomes, half X and half Y.&lt;ref name="discoverPlatypus"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2005/apr/sex-ys-platypuses0425/|title=Sex, Ys, and Platypuses|publisher=Discover|author=Selim, Jocelyn |date=25 April 2005|accessdate=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, what is functionally relevant are differences in composition and "wiring". [[Richard J.

Grey matter is used for information processing, while white matter consists of the connections between processing centers. Other differences are measurable but less pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tamminga, Carol A. |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/156/3/352 |title=Brain Development, XI: Sexual Dimorphism|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=156|year=1999|pages= 352|pmid=10080547|last2=Kennedy|first2=DN|last3=Caviness Jr|first3=VS|issue=3|doi=10.1176/ajp.156.3.352|doi-broken-date=2018-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of these differences are produced by hormonal activity, ultimately derived from the Y chromosome and sexual differentiation. However, differences that arise directly from gene activity have also been observed.

It has also been demonstrated that brain processing responds to the external environment. Learning, both of ideas and behaviors, appears to be coded in brain processes. It also appears that in several simplified cases this coding operates differently, but in some ways equivalently, in the brains of men and women.&lt;ref&gt;"Even when men and women do the same chores equally well, they may use different brain circuits to get the same result." Linda Marsha (July 2007). [http://discovermagazine.com/2007/brain/she-thinks 'He Thinks, She Thinks',] ''[[Discover (magazine)]]''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, both men and women learn and use language; however, [[Biochemistry|bio-chemically]], they appear to process it differently. Differences in female and male use of language are likely reflections ''both'' of biological preferences and aptitudes, ''and'' of learned patterns.

== Gender studies ==
{{Main|Gender studies}}
[[Gender studies]] is a [[Field of study|field]] of [[interdisciplinary]] study and [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] devoted to gender, [[gender identity]] and gendered [[Representation (politics)|representation]] as central categories of analysis. This field includes [[Women's studies]] (concerning [[women]], [[feminity]], their [[gender role]]s and politics, and [[feminism]]), [[Men's studies]] (concerning [[men]], [[masculinity]], their [[gender role]]s, and politics), and [[LGBT studies]].&lt;ref name="whitman"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whitman.edu/content/genderstudies | archive-url=https://archive.is/20121212181127/http://www.whitman.edu/content/genderstudies | dead-url=yes | archive-date=12 December 2012 | title=Gender Studies | publisher=Whitman College | accessdate=2 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes Gender studies is offered together with Study of [[Human sexuality|Sexuality]].
These disciplines study gender and sexuality in the fields of literature and language, [[history]], [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[Film studies|cinema]] and [[media studies]], human development, law, and medicine.&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gendersexuality.uchicago.edu/about/|title=About – Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality (CSGS)|publisher=[[The University of Chicago]]|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychology and sociology ==
{{See also|Sex and psychology}}
Many of the more complicated human behaviors are influenced by both innate factors and by environmental ones, which include everything from genes, gene expression, and body chemistry, through diet and social pressures. A large area of research in [[behavioralism|behavioral psychology]] collates evidence in an effort to discover [[correlation]]s between behavior and various possible antecedents such as genetics, gene regulation, access to food and vitamins, culture, gender, hormones, physical and social development, and physical and social environments.

A core research area within sociology is the way human behavior operates on ''itself'', in other words, how the behavior of one group or individual influences the behavior of other groups or individuals. Starting in the late 20th century, the feminist movement has contributed extensive study of gender and theories about it, notably within sociology but not restricted to it.

Social theorists have sought to determine the specific nature of gender in relation to biological sex and sexuality,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} with the result being that culturally established gender and sex have become interchangeable identifications that signify the allocation of a specific 'biological' sex within a categorical gender.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The second wave feminist view that gender is socially constructed and hegemonic in all societies, remains current in some literary theoretical circles, Kira Hall and Mary Bucholtz publishing new perspectives as recently as 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6d37lDUcLYEC&amp;pg=PP11 |title= Gender Articulated |accessdate= 21 September 2008 |publisher= Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-91399-7 |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary socialisation theory proposes the notion that when a child is first born it has a biological sex but no social gender.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} As the child grows, "...society provides a string of prescriptions, templates, or models of behaviors appropriate to the one sex or the other,"&lt;ref&gt;Connell, R.

Some believe society is constructed in a way that splits gender into a dichotomy via social organisations that constantly invent and reproduce cultural images of gender. Joan Acker believes gendering occurs in at least five different interacting social processes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1990|title=Hierarchies, Jobs, Bodies: A Theory of Gendered Organizations|url=http://www.csun.edu/~snk1966/J.%20Acker%20Hierarchies,%20Jobs,%20Bodies%20--%20A%20Theory%20of%20Gendered%20Organizations.pdf|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=4|issue=2|pages=139–158|doi=10.1177/089124390004002002|jstor=189609|last1=Acker|first1=J.|citeseerx=10.1.1.693.1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The construction of divisions along the lines of gender, such as those produced by labor, power, family, the state, even allowed behaviors and locations in physical space
* The construction of symbols and images such as language, ideology, dress and the media, that explain, express and reinforce, or sometimes oppose, those divisions
* Interactions between men and women, women and women and men and men that involve any form of dominance and submission. Conversational theorists, for example, have studied the way that interruptions, turn taking and the setting of topics re-create gender inequality in the flow of ordinary talk
* The way that the preceding three processes help to produce gendered components of individual identity, i.e., the way they create and maintain an image of a gendered self
* Gender is implicated in the fundamental, ongoing processes of creating and conceptualising social structures.

Looking at gender through a Foucauldian lens, gender is transfigured into a vehicle for the social division of power. Gender difference is merely a construct of society used to enforce the distinctions made between what is assumed to be female and male, and allow for the domination of masculinity over femininity through the attribution of specific gender-related characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Deji, Olanike F. (2012) ''Gender Concepts and Theories''. Gender and Rural Development. Berlin: Lit. N..&lt;/ref&gt; "The idea that men and women are more different from one another than either is from anything else, must come from something other than nature... far from being an expression of natural differences, exclusive gender identity is the suppression of natural similarities."&lt;ref name=glover&gt;Glover, D and Kaplan, C (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2NLbiutayFoC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Genders''], Routledge, New York {{ISBN|0-415-44243-5}}, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender conventions play a large role in attributing masculine and feminine characteristics to a fundamental biological sex.&lt;ref&gt;Mikkola, Mari, "Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2016 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/feminism-gender/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Socio-cultural codes and conventions, the rules by which society functions, and which are both a creation of society as well as a constituting element of it, determine the allocation of these specific traits to the sexes. These traits provide the foundations for the creation of hegemonic gender difference. It follows then, that gender can be assumed as the acquisition and internalisation of social norms. Individuals are therefore socialized through their receipt of society's expectations of 'acceptable' gender attributes that are flaunted within institutions such as the family, the state and the media. Such a notion of 'gender' then becomes naturalized into a person's sense of self or identity, effectively imposing a gendered social category upon a sexed body.&lt;ref name=glover /&gt;

The conception that people are gendered rather than sexed also coincides with Judith Butler's theories of gender performativity. Butler argues that gender is not an expression of what one is, but rather something that one does.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1999|title=Performativity, Parody, Politics|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|volume=16|issue=2|pages=195–213|doi=10.1177/02632769922050476|last1=Lloyd|first1=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows then, that if gender is acted out in a repetitive manner it is in fact re-creating and effectively embedding itself within the social consciousness. Contemporary sociological reference to male and female gender roles typically uses ''masculinities'' and ''femininities'' in the plural rather than singular, suggesting diversity both within cultures as well as across them.

The difference between the sociological and popular definitions of gender involve a different dichotomy and focus. For example, the sociological approach to "gender" (social roles: female versus male) focuses on the difference in (economic/power) position between a male CEO (disregarding the fact that he is [[heterosexual]] or [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]) to female workers in his employ (disregarding whether they are straight or gay). However the popular sexual self-conception approach (self-conception: gay versus straight) focuses on the different self-conceptions and social conceptions of those who are gay/straight, in comparison with those who are straight (disregarding what might be vastly differing economic and power positions between female and male groups in each category). There is then, in relation to definition of and approaches to "gender", a tension between historic feminist sociology and contemporary homosexual sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1994|title=The Heterosexual Imaginary: Feminist Sociology and Theories of Gender|journal=Sociological Theory|volume=12|issue=2|pages=203–219|doi=10.2307/201865|jstor=201865|author=Ingraham, Chrys|citeseerx=10.1.1.470.737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal status ==

A person's sex as male or female has legal significance—sex is indicated on government documents, and laws provide differently for men and women. Many pension systems have different retirement ages for men or women. Marriage is usually only available to opposite-sex couples; in some countries and jurisdictions there are [[same-sex marriage]] laws.

The question then arises as to what legally determines whether someone is female or male. In most cases this can appear obvious, but the matter is complicated for [[intersex]] or [[transgender]] people. Different jurisdictions have adopted different answers to this question. Almost all countries permit changes of legal gender status in cases of intersexualism, when the gender assignment made at birth is determined upon further investigation to be biologically inaccurate—technically, however, this is not a change of status ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]''. Rather, it is recognition of a status deemed to exist but unknown from birth. Increasingly, jurisdictions also provide a procedure for changes of legal gender for transgender people.

[[Sex assignment|Gender assignment]], when there are indications that genital sex might not be decisive in a particular case, is normally not defined by a single definition, but by a combination of conditions, including chromosomes and gonads. Thus, for example, in many jurisdictions a person with XY chromosomes but female [[gonad]]s could be recognized as female at birth.

The ability to [[Legal aspects of transsexualism|change legal gender]] for transgender people in particular has given rise to the phenomena in some jurisdictions of the same person having different genders for the purposes of different areas of the law. For example, in Australia prior to the Re Kevin decisions, transsexual people could be recognized as having the genders they identified with under many areas of the law, including social security law, but not for the law of marriage. Thus, for a period, it was possible for the same person to have two different genders under Australian law.

It is also possible in federal systems for the same person to have one gender under state law and a different gender under federal law.

=== Languages ===
{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Natural languages often make gender distinctions. These may be of various kinds, more or less loosely associated by analogy with various actual or perceived differences between men and women.  Some grammatical gender systems go beyond, or ignore, the masculine-feminine distinction.
&lt;ref&gt;Kroulek, A. (2016, January 18). Why do languages have gender? Retrieved March 12, 2018, from http://www.k-international.com/blog/why-do-languages-have-gender/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many languages include terms that are used asymmetrically in reference to men and women. Concern that current language may be biased in favor of men has led some authors in recent times to argue for the use of a more [[Gender-neutral language in English|gender-neutral vocabulary]] in English and other languages.
* Several languages attest the use of different vocabulary by men and women, to differing degrees. See, for instance, [[Gender differences in spoken Japanese]]. The oldest documented language, [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], records a distinctive sub-language only used by female speakers. Conversely, many [[Indigenous Australian languages]] have distinctive registers with a limited [[lexicon]] used by men in the presence of their mothers-in-law (see [[Avoidance speech]]). As well, quite a few [[sign language]]s have a gendered distinction due to boarding schools segregated by gender, such as [[Irish Sign Language]].
* Several languages such as [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] are gender-neutral. In Persian the same word is used in reference to men and women. Verbs, adjectives and nouns are not gendered. (See [[Gender-neutrality in genderless languages]])
* [[Grammatical gender]] is a property of some languages in which every [[noun]] is assigned a gender, often with no direct relation to its meaning. For example, the word for "girl" is ''[[:es:muchacha|muchacha]]'' (grammatically feminine) in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''[[:de:Mädchen|Mädchen]]'' (grammatically neuter) in [[German language|German]], and ''[[:ga:cailín|cailín]]'' (grammatically masculine) in [[Irish language|Irish]].
* The term "[[grammatical gender]]" is often applied to more complex [[noun class]] systems. This is especially true when a noun class system includes masculine and feminine as well as some other non-gender features like animate, edible, manufactured, and so forth. An example of the latter is found in the [[Dyirbal language]]. Other gender systems exist with no distinction between masculine and feminine; examples include a distinction between animate and inanimate things, which is common to, amongst others, [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Hittite language|Hittite]]; and systems distinguishing between people (whether human or divine) and everything else, which are found in the [[Dravidian languages]] and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]].
* Several languages employ different ways to refer to people where there are three or more genders, such as [[Navajo language|Navajo]] or [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]].

=== Science ===
Historically, science has been portrayed as a masculine pursuit in which women have faced significant barriers to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiebinger|first1=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science?|date=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0-674-00544-0|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after universities began admitting women in the 19th century, women were still largely relegated to certain scientific fields, such as [[home science]], [[nursing]], and [[child psychology]].&lt;ref name="Sheffield2006"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and Science: Social Impact and Interaction|date=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3737-5|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=129–134|last1=Sheffield|first1=Suzanne Le-May}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were also typically given tedious, low-paying jobs and denied opportunities for career advancement.&lt;ref name="Sheffield2006" /&gt; This was often justified by the stereotype that women were naturally more suited to jobs that required concentration, patience, and dexterity, rather than creativity, leadership, or intellect.&lt;ref name="Sheffield2006" /&gt; Although these stereotypes have been dispelled in modern times, women are still underrepresented in prestigious "[[Hard and soft science|hard science]]" fields such as [[physics]], and are less likely to hold high-ranking positions.&lt;ref name="Eisenhart1998"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women's Science: Learning and Succeeding from the Margins|journal=Science Education|volume=84|issue=6|last2=Finkel|first2=Elizabeth|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-19544-5|location=Chicago|pages=34–36|last1=Eisenhart|first1=Margaret A.|bibcode=2000SciEd..84..793A|doi=10.1002/1098-237X(200011)84:6&lt;793::AID-SCE6&gt;3.0.CO;2-K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{further|Gender and religion}}
This topic includes internal and external religious issues such as [[Gender of God|gender of God and deities]] creation myths about human gender, roles and rights (for instance, leadership roles especially [[ordination of women]], [[sex segregation]], gender equality, marriage, abortion, [[Homosexuality and religion|homosexuality]])

According to Kati Niemelä of the Church Research Institute, women are universally more [[religious]] than men. They believe that the difference in religiosity between genders is due to biological differences, for instance usually people seeking security in life are more religious, and as men are considered to be greater risk takers than women, they are less religious. Although [[religious fanaticism]] is more often seen in men than women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/08/women_more_religious_than_men_1939513.html Women More Religious than Men]. yle.fi (29 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|100px|[[Yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']]]]
In [[Taoism]], [[yin and yang]] are considered feminine and masculine, respectively. The Taijitu and concept of the Zhou period reach into family and gender relations. Yin is female and yang is male. They fit together as two parts of a whole.
The male principle was equated with the sun: active, bright, and shining; the female principle corresponds to the moon: passive, shaded, and reflective. Male toughness was balanced by female gentleness, male action and initiative by female endurance and need for completion, and male leadership by female supportiveness.

In [[Judaism]], [[God]] is traditionally described in the masculine, but in the mystical tradition of the [[Kabbalah]], the [[Shekhinah]] represents the feminine aspect of God's essence. However, Judaism [[Jewish principles of faith|traditionally holds]] that God is completely non-corporeal, and thus neither male nor female. Conceptions of the gender of God notwithstanding, traditional Judaism places a strong emphasis on individuals following Judaism's traditional gender roles, though many modern [[Jewish religious movements|denominations of Judaism]] strive for greater egalitarianism. As well, traditional Jewish culture dictates that there are [[Gender and Judaism|six genders]].

In [[Christianity]], God is traditionally described in masculine terms and the Church has historically been described in feminine terms. On the other hand, Christian [[theology]] in many churches distinguishes between the masculine images used of God (Father, King, God the Son) and the reality they signify, which transcends gender, embodies all the virtues of both men and women perfectly, which may be seen through the doctrine of [[Imago Dei]]. In the [[New Testament]], Jesus at several times mentions with the masculine pronoun i.e. John 15:26 among other verses. Hence, [[God the Father|the Father]], [[God the Son|the Son]] and [[the Holy Spirit]] (i.e. [[Trinity]]) are all mentioned with the masculine pronoun; though the exact meaning of the masculinity of the Christian triune God is contended.

In [[Hinduism]]

{{quote|One of the several forms of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] God [[Shiva]], is Ardhanarishwar (literally half-female God). Here Shiva manifests himself so that the left half is Female and the right half is Male. The left represents Shakti (energy, power) in the form of Goddess [[Parvati]] (otherwise his consort) and the right half Shiva. Whereas Parvati is the cause of arousal of Kama (desires), Shiva is the killer. Shiva is pervaded by the power of Parvati and Parvati is pervaded by the power of Shiva.

While the stone images may seem to represent a half-male and half-female God, the true symbolic representation is of a being the whole of which is Shiva and the whole of which is Shakti at the same time. It is a 3-D representation of only shakti from one angle and only Shiva from the other. Shiva and Shakti are hence the same being representing a collective of Jnana (knowledge) and Kriya (activity).

Adi Shankaracharya, the founder of non-dualistic philosophy (Advaita–"not two") in Hindu thought says in his "Saundaryalahari"—''Shivah Shaktayaa yukto yadi bhavati shaktah prabhavitum na che devum devona khalu kushalah spanditam api'' " i.e., It is only when Shiva is united with Shakti that He acquires the capability of becoming the Lord of the Universe. In the absence of Shakti, He is not even able to stir. In fact, the term "Shiva" originated from "Shva," which implies a dead body. It is only through his inherent shakti that Shiva realizes his true nature.

This mythology projects the inherent view in ancient Hinduism, that each human carries within himself both female and male components, which are forces rather than sexes, and it is the harmony between the creative and the annihilative, the strong and the soft, the proactive and the passive, that makes a true person. Such thought, leave alone entail gender equality, in fact obliterates any material distinction between the male and female altogether. This may explain why in ancient India we find evidence of homosexuality, bisexuality, androgyny, [[multiple sex partners]] and open representation of sexual pleasures in artworks like the Khajuraho temples, being accepted within prevalent social frameworks.|&lt;ref name="vohra"&gt;"The Male-Female Hologram," Ashok Vohra, [[Times of India]], March 8, 2005, Page 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a number of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|North American Indigenous]] cultures, non-man/-woman individuals sometimes carried specific roles within that nation's religious structures. These could be the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] wíŋkte, [[Navajo]] ''{{spell-nv|[[Nádleehi]]|nádleeh}}'', [[Ojibwe|Anishinaabe]] niizh manidoowag and hundreds more. Recently, North American Native Americans and First Nations have adopted the term [[Two-Spirit]] to refer to the mosaic of different genders cross-culturally.

=== Poverty ===
{{Main|Feminization of poverty}}

[[Gender inequality]] is most common in women dealing with poverty. Many women must shoulder all the responsibility of the household because they must take care of the family. Oftentimes this may include tasks such as tilling land, grinding grain, carrying water and cooking.&lt;ref name=UNPD&gt;[http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/povertyreduction/focus_areas/focus_gender_and_poverty/ Gender and Poverty Reduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029203731/http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/povertyreduction/focus_areas/focus_gender_and_poverty/ |date=29 October 2014 }}. UNPD.org. 29 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Also, women are more likely to earn low incomes because of gender discrimination, as men are more likely to receive higher pay, have more opportunities, and have overall more political and social capital then women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1987|title=The Feminization of Poverty|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|volume=21|issue=1|pages=329–337|jstor=4225831|author=Peterson, Janice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 75% of world's women are unable to obtain bank loans because they have unstable jobs.&lt;ref name=UNPD /&gt; It shows that there are many women in the world's population but only a few represent world's wealth. In many countries, the financial sector largely neglects women even though they play an important role in the economy, as Nena Stoiljkovic pointed out in ''D+C Development and Cooperation''.&lt;ref&gt;Stoiljkovic, Nena. [http://www.dandc.eu/articles/220419/index.en.shtml Smart finance]. D+C Development and Cooperation&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 Diana M.

E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strain in the general strain theory is the removal of a positive stimulus and or the introduction of a negative stimulus, which would create a negative effect (strain) within individual, which is either inner-directed (depression/guilt) or outer-directed (anger/frustration), which depends on whether the individual blames themselves or their environment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Blurton|first2=D.|last3=McCluskey|first3=J.D.|year=2007|title=General Strain Theory and Delinquency: Focusing on the Influences of Key Strain Characteristics on Delinquency|journal=Crime &amp; Delinquency|volume=54|issue=4|pages=582–613|doi=10.1177/0011128707301627|last1=Moon|first1=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies reveal that even though males and females are equally likely to react to a strain with anger, the origin of the anger and their means of coping with it can vary drastically.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; Males are likely to put the blame on others for adversity and therefore externalize feelings of anger.&lt;ref name="Agnew, Robert 2012" /&gt; Females typically internalize their angers and tend to blame themselves instead.&lt;ref name="Agnew, Robert 2012" /&gt; Female internalized anger is accompanied by feelings of guilt, fear, anxiety and depression.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com" /&gt; Women view anger as a sign that they've somehow lost control, and thus worry that this anger may lead them to harm others and/or damage relationships. On the other end of the spectrum, men are less concerned with damaging relationships and more focused on using anger as a means of affirming their masculinity.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com" /&gt; According to the general strain theory, men would more likely engage in aggressive behavior directed towards others due to externalized anger whereas women would direct their anger towards themselves rather than others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

=== Economic development ===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
Gender, and particularly the role of women is widely recognized as vitally important to [[international development]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;Adema, W., Ali, N., Frey, V., Kim, H., Lunati, M., Piacentini, M. and Queisser, M. (2014). Enhancing Women's Economic Empowerment Through Entrepreneurship and Business leadership in OECD Countries. OECD.&lt;/ref&gt; This often means a focus on gender-equality, ensuring [[participation (decision making)|participation]], but includes an understanding of the different roles and expectation of the genders within the community.&lt;ref&gt;OECD, ILO, IMF and WBG, (2014). Achieving stronger growth by promoting a more genderbalanced economy. Report prepared for the G20 Labour and Employment Ministerial Meeting. Melbourne, Australia: G20 Labour and Employment Ministerial Meeting.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the study of gender and development has become a broad field that involves politicians, economists, and [[human rights defender|human rights activists]]. Gender and Development, unlike previous theories concerning women in development, includes a broader view of the effects of development on gender including economic, political, and social issues. The theory takes a holistic approach to development and its effects on women and recognizes the negative effects gender blind development policies have had on women. Prior to 1970, it was believed that development affected men and women in the same way and no gendered perspective existed for development studies. However, the 1970s saw a transformation in development theory that sought to incorporate women into existing development paradigms.

When [[Ester Boserup]] published her book, ''Woman’s Role in Economic Development'', there was a realization that development affected men and women differently and there began to be more of a focus on women and development. Boserup argued that women were marginalized in the modernization process and practices of growth, development, and development policy threatened to actually make women worse off.
Boserup's work translated into the beginning of a larger discourse termed [[Women in Development]] (WID) coined by the Women's Committee of the Washington DC Chapter of the [[Society for International Development]], a network of female development professionals. The primary goal of WID was to include women into existing development initiatives, since it was argued that women were marginalized and excluded from the benefits of development. In so doing, the WID approach pointed out that the major problem to women's unequal representation and participation were male biased and patriarchal development policies. In short, the WID approach blamed patriarchy, which did not consider women's productive and reproductive work. In fact, women were tied to domestic work hence were almost invisible in development programs. The WID approach, however, began to gain criticism as ignoring how women's economic [[marginalization]] was linked to the development model itself.

Some feminists{{who|date=July 2016}} argued that the key concept for women and development should be subordination in the context of new capitalist forms of insecure and hierarchical job structures, rather than marginalization as WID approaches emphasized. The rise of criticism against the WID approach led to the emergence of a new theory, that of Women and Development (WAD).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

However, just as WID had its critics, so did WAD. Critics{{who|date=July 2016}} of WAD argued that it failed to sufficiently address the differential power relations between women and men, and tended to overemphasize women's productive as opposed to reproductive roles. Also, rising criticism of the exclusion of men in WID and WAD led to a new theory termed [[Gender and Development]] (GAD). Drawing from insights developed in psychology, sociology, and gender studies, GAD theorists shifted from understanding women's problems as based on their sex (i.e. their biological differences from men) to understanding them as based on gender – the social relations between women and men, their social construction, and how women have been systematically subordinated in this relationship.

At their most fundamental, GAD perspectives link the social relations of production with the social relations of reproduction – exploring why and how women and men are assigned to different roles and responsibilities in society, how these dynamics are reflected in social, economic, and political theories and institutions, and how these relationships affect development policy effectiveness. According to proponents of GAD, women are cast not as passive recipients of development aid, but rather as active agents of change whose empowerment should be a central goal of development policy. In contemporary times, most literature and institutions that are concerned with women's role in development incorporate a GAD perspective, with the United Nations taking the lead of mainstreaming the GAD approach through its system and development policies.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have highlighted that policy dialogue on the [[Millennium Development Goals]] needs to recognize that the gender dynamics of power, poverty, [[social vulnerability|vulnerability]] and care link all the goals.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2386&amp;title=gender-mdgs-gender-lens-vital-pro-poor-results |title=Gender and the MDGS |date=September 2008 |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310100258/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2386&amp;title=gender-mdgs-gender-lens-vital-pro-poor-results |archivedate=10 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The various United Nations international women's conferences in Beijing, Mexico City, Copenhagen, and Nairobi, as well as the development of the Millennium Development Goals in 2000 have taken a GAD approach and holistic view of development. The [[United Nations Millennium Declaration]] signed at the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000 including eight goals that were to be reached by 2015, and although it would be a difficult task to reach them, all of them could be monitored. The eight goals are:
# Halve the proportion of people living in extreme poverty at the 1990 level by 2015.
# Achieve universal primary education
# Promote gender equality and empower women
# Reduce child mortality rates
# Improve maternal health
# Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases
# Ensure environmental sustainability
# Global partnership

The MDGs have three goals specifically focused on women: Goal 3, 4 and 5 but women's issues also cut across all of the goals. These goals overall comprise all aspects of women's lives including economic, health, and political participation.

[[Gender equality]] is also strongly linked to [[education]]. The [[Dakar Framework for Action]] (2000) set out ambitious goals: to eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education by 2005, and to achieve gender equality in education by 2015. The focus was on ensuring girls' full and equal access to and achievement in good quality basic education. The gender objective of the Dakar Framework for Action is somewhat different from the MDG Goal 3 (Target 1): "Eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education, preferably by 2005, and in all levels of education no later than 2015". MDG Goal 3 does not comprise a reference to learner achievement and good quality basic education, but goes beyond the school level. Studies demonstrate the positive impact of girls' education on child and maternal health, fertility rates, poverty reduction and economic growth. Educated mothers are more likely to send their children to school.&lt;ref name="Achieving Gender Equality"&gt;[http://www.iiep.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Info_Services_Newsletter/pdf/eng/2010/2010_1En.pdf IIEP Newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716103610/http://www.iiep.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Info_Services_Newsletter/pdf/eng/2010/2010_1En.pdf |date=16 July 2011 }}, Achieving Gender Equality in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations working in developing countries and in the development field have incorporated advocacy and empowerment for women into their work. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations (FAO) adopted a 10-year strategic framework in November 2009 that includes the strategic objective of gender equity in access to resources, goods, services and decision-making in rural areas, and mainstreams gender equity in all FAO's programs for agriculture and rural development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/gender/gender-home/gender-programme/gender-equity/en/|title= Gender equity|date=November 2009|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association for Progressive Communications]] (APC) has developed a [[Gender Evaluation Methodology]] for planning and evaluating development projects to ensure they benefit all sectors of society including women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genderevaluation.net/ Gender Evaluation Methodology (GEM)]. genderevaluation.net&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gender-related Development Index (GDI), developed by the United Nations, aims to show the inequalities between men and women in the following areas: long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has introduced indicators designed to add a gendered dimension to the Human Development Index (HDI). Additionally, in 1995, the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI) and the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] (GEM) were introduced. More recently, in 2010, UNDP introduced a new indicator, the [[Gender Inequality Index]] (GII), which was designed to be a better measurement of gender inequality and to improve the shortcomings of GDI and GEM.

=== Climate change ===
{{Main|Climate change and gender}}
Gender is a topic of increasing concern within [[climate change]] policy and science.&lt;ref name="Olsson"&gt;Olsson, Lennart'' et al.'' (2014) [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap13_FINAL.pdf "Livelihoods and Poverty"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028162950/http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap13_FINAL.pdf |date=28 October 2014 }}, pp. 793–832 in ''Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability. Part A: Global and Sectoral Aspects. Contribution of Working Group II to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.'' Ed. C.B. Field et al. Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, gender approaches to climate change address gender-differentiated consequences of climate change, as well as unequal [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] capacities and gendered contribution to climate change. Furthermore, the intersection of climate change and gender raises questions regarding the complex and [[intersectionality|intersecting]] power relations arising from it. These differences, however, are mostly not due to biological or physical differences, but are formed by the social, institutional and legal context. Subsequently, [[vulnerability]] is less an intrinsic feature of women and girls but rather a product of their marginalization.&lt;ref name="Birkmann"&gt;Birkmann, Joern et al. (2014)[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4-wg2-chapter19.pdf "Emergent Risks and Key Vulnerabilities"], pp. 1039–1099 in ''Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability.

Geraldine Terry and Caroline Sweetman (eds.). Warwickshire: Practical Action Publishing, Oxfam GB.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some feminist scholars hold that the debate on climate change is not only dominated by men but also primarily shaped in ‘masculine’ principles, which limits discussions about climate change to a perspective that focuses on technical solutions.&lt;ref name="Tuana" /&gt; This perception of climate change hides subjectivity and power relations that actually condition climate-change policy and science, leading to a phenomenon that Tuana&lt;ref name="Tuana" /&gt; terms ‘epistemic injustice’.
Similarly, MacGregor&lt;ref name="MacGregor"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2010|title=A stranger silence still: The need for feminist social research on climate change|journal=The Sociological Review|volume=57|issue=2_suppl|pages=124–140|doi=10.1111/j.1467-954X.2010.01889.x|last1=MacGregor|first1=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; attests that by framing climate change as an issue of ‘hard’ natural scientific conduct and natural security, it is kept within the traditional domains of hegemonic masculinity.&lt;ref name="MacGregor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyd" /&gt;

=== Social media ===
Gender roles and stereotypes have slowly started to change in society within the past few decades. These changes occur mostly in communication, but more specifically during social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Eisenstein|first2=Jacob|last3=Schnoebelen|first3=Tyler|date=April 2014|title=Gender identity and lexical variation in social media|journal=Journal of Sociolinguistics|volume=18|issue=2|pages=135–160|doi=10.1111/josl.12080|last1=Bamman|first1=David|arxiv=1210.4567}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ways people communicate and socialize have also started to change alongside advancement in technology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayat|first=Tsahi (Zack)|last2=Lesser|first2=Ofrit|last3=Samuel-Azran|first3=Tal|title=Gendered discourse patterns on online social networks: A social network analysis perspective|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0747563217305095|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=77|pages=132–139|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2017.08.041|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the biggest reasons for this change is due to social media.

Over the past few years, the use of social media globally has started to rise.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lesser|first=Ofrit|last2=Hayat|first2=Tsahi (Zack)|last3=Elovici|first3=Yuval|date=2017-11-02|title=The role of network setting and gender in online content popularity|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=20|issue=11|pages=1607–1624|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2016.1252411|issn=1369-118X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This rise can be contributed to the abundance of technology available for use among youth. Recent studies suggest that men and women value and use technology differently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Wilson|first2=S.A.|last3=DuFrene|first3=D.D.|date=14 October 2011|title=The Social Networking Arena: Battle of the Sexes|journal=Business Communication Quarterly|volume=75|issue=1|pages=64–67|doi=10.1177/1080569911423961|last1=Clipson|first1=T.W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes published an article in 2010 that reported 57% of Facebook users are women, which attributed to the fact that women are more active on social media, because on average women have 8% more friends and account for 62% of posts that are shared via Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gourdreau |first1=Jenna |date=26 April 2010 |title=What men and women are doing on Facebook |work=Forbes |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/04/26/popular-social-networking-sites-forbes-woman-time-facebook-twitter.html |accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study in 2010 found that in most Western cultures, women spend more time sending text messages compared to men as well as spend more time on social networking sites as a way to communicate with friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Tufekci |first1=Zeynep |title=Gender, social capital and social network(ing) sites: Women bonding, men searching |publisher=American Sociological Association |url=http://research.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/2/6/9/p242696_index.html |accessdate=14 April 2016|date=2008-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayat, Lesser and Samuel-Azran (2017) have further shown that while men write more posts in social networking sites, women commented on other people's posts more often. They further showed that women's posts enjoyed higher popularity than men's post''s.''

Social media is more than just the communication of words. With social media increasing in popularity, pictures have become a large role in how many people communicate. Research conducted in 2013 found that over 57% of pictures posted on social networking sites were sexual and were created to gain attention.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Araüna-Baró|first2=Núria|last3=Martínez-Martínez|first3=Inmaculada José|date=1 June 2013|title=Advertising Stereotypes and Gender Representation in Social Networking Sites|journal=Comunicar|volume=21|issue=41|pages=177–186|doi=10.3916/C41-2013-17|last1=Tortajada-Giménez|first1=Iolanda}}&lt;/ref&gt; More shockingly, 58% of women and 45% of men don't  look into the camera, which is creating an illusion of withdrawal.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Other factors to be considered are the poses in pictures such as women laying down in subordinate positions or even touching themselves in child like ways.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In conclusion, research has found that images shared online through social networking sites help establish personal self-reflections that individuals want to share with the world.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

According to recent research, gender plays a strong role in structuring our social lives, especially since society assigns and creates "male" and "female" categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hodkinson|first1=P.|title=Bedrooms and beyond: Youth, identity and privacy on social network sites|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=19|issue=2|pages=272–288|date=22 September 2015|doi=10.1177/1461444815605454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals in society might be able to learn the similarities between gender rather than the differences. Until then, gender will never truly be equal, which is a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Mackey-Kallis|first2=Susan|last3=Shyles|first3=Len|last4=Barry|first4=Kelly|last5=Biagini|first5=Danielle|last6=Hart|first6=Colleen|last7=Jack|first7=Lauren|date=November 2012|title=Face it: The Impact of Gender on Social Media Images|journal=Communication Quarterly|volume=60|issue=5|pages=588–607|doi=10.1080/01463373.2012.725005|last1=Rose|first1=Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media helps create more equality, because every individual is able to express him or herself however they like. Every individual also has the right to express their opinion, even though some might disagree, but it still gives each gender an equal amount of power to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=HA |last2=Eichstaedt |first2=JC |last3=Kern |first3=ML |last4=Dziurzynski |first4=L |last5=Ramones |first5=SM |last6=Agrawal |first6=M |last7=Shah |first7=A |last8=Kosinski |first8=M |last9=Stillwell |first9=D |last10=Seligman |first10=ME |last11=Ungar |first11=LH |title=Personality, gender, and age in the language of social media: the open-vocabulary approach. |journal=PLOS One |date=2013 |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=e73791 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0073791 |pmid=24086296|pmc=3783449 |bibcode=2013PLoSO...873791S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young adults in the U.S. frequently use social networking sites as a way to connect and communicate with one another, as well as to satisfy their curiosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Explaining why young adults use MySpace and Facebook through uses and gratifications theory|last2=Dong|first2=Q|last3=Day|first3=K.D|date=2009|edition=2|pages=215–229|last1=Urista|first1=M.A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescent girls generally use social networking sites as a tool to communicate with peers and reinforce existing relationships; boys on the other hand tend to use social networking sites as a tool to meet new friends and acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Older adolescents' motivations for social network site use: The influence of gender, group identity, and collective self-esteem|publisher=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|edition=2|pages=209–213|last1=Barker|first1=V}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, social networking sites have allowed individuals to truly express themselves, as they are able to create an identity and socialize with other individuals that can relate.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Ridder|first1=Sander|last2=van Bauwel|first2=Sofie|title=Youth and intimate media cultures: Gender, sexuality, relationships, and desire as storytelling practices in social networking sites|journal=Communications|date=1 January 2015|volume=40|issue=3|doi=10.1515/commun-2015-0012|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/5889652/file/7011376.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social networking sites have also given individuals access to create a space where they feel more comfortable about their sexuality.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Recent research has indicated that social media is becoming a stronger part of younger individuals media culture, as more intimate stories are being told via social media and are being intertwined with gender, sexuality, and relationships.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Teens are avid internet and social media users in the United States. Research has found that almost all U.S. teens (95%) aged 12 through 17 are online, compared to only 78% of adults. Of these teens, 80% have profiles on social media sites, as compared to only 64% of the online population aged 30 and older. According to a study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 11-to-18 year olds spend – on average – over one and a half hours a day using a computer and 27 minutes per day visiting social network sites, which accounts for more than one fourth of their daily computer use.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herring|first1=Susan|last2=Kapidzic|first2=Sanja|title=Teens, Gender, and Self-Presentation in Social Media|date=2015|publisher=International encyclopedia of social and behavioral sciences|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teen girls and boys differ in what they post in their online profiles. Studies have shown that female users tend to post more "cute" pictures, while male participants were more likely to post pictures of them doing action activities. Women in the U.S. also tend to post more pictures of friends, while boys tend to post more about sports and humorous links. The study also found that males would post more alcohol and sexual references.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The roles were reversed however, when looking at a teenage dating site. Women referred to sexual references significantly more than males.

Boys share more personal information, like their hometown and phone number. While girls are more conservative about the personal information they allow to go public on these social networking sites. Boys, meanwhile, are more likely to orient towards technology, sports, and humor in the information they post to their profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malin|first1=Sveningsson Elm,|title=Doing and undoing gender in a Swedish Internet community|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kau:diva-18434|accessdate=14 April 2016|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media goes beyond the role of helping individuals express themselves, as it has grown to help individuals create relationships, particularly romantic relationships. A large amount of social media users have found it easier to create relationships in a less direct approach, compared to the traditional approach of awkwardly asking for someone's number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Role of Facebook in Romantic Relationship Development: An Exploration of Knapp's Relational Stage Model|date=2012|publisher=Conference Papers – International Communication Association|pages=1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media plays a big role when it comes to communication between genders. Therefore, it's important to understand how gender stereotypes develop during online interactions. Research in the 1990s suggested that different genders display certain traits such as being active, attractive, dependent, dominant, independent, sentimental, sexy, and submissive when it comes to online interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Gauntlett|first1=D|title=Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ScR9AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=gender%2Band%2Bsocial%2Bmedia#v=onepage&amp;q=gender%20and%20social%20media|website=Media, Gender and Identity|accessdate=14 April 2016|isbn=9781134155026|date=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though these traits continue to be displayed through gender stereotypes, recent studies show that this isn't necessarily the case anymore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herring|first1=I|title=Teens, Gender, and Self-Presentation in Social Media.

The '''Greensboro massacre''' is the term for an event which took place on November 3, 1979, when members of the [[Communist Workers' Party (United States)|Communist Workers' Party]] and others demonstrated in a "Death to the Klan" march in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], United States. The CWP, which advocated that Klan members should be "physically beaten and chased out of town", engaged in a shootout with members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the [[American Nazi Party]].&lt;ref name="Physical"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcdm1.uncg.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/CivilRights/id/411/rec/22|title=Smash the Klan with correct understanding and armed self-defense|publisher=The University of North Carolina at Greensboro, University Libraries|author=Workers Viewpoint Organization| date=November 1, 1979|accessdate= February 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four members of the Communist Workers' Party and one other individual were killed, and eleven other demonstrators and a Klansman were wounded. The CWP supported [[Labor rights|workers' rights]] activism among mostly [[African Americans|black]] textile industrial workers in the area.&lt;ref name="Civil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="democracy"/&gt;

Two criminal trials of several Klan and ANP members were conducted: six men were prosecuted in a state criminal trial in 1980, five were charged with murder. All were [[Acquittal|acquitted]] by an [[all-white jury]]. A second, federal criminal civil rights trial in 1984 concluded with the acquittal of the nine defendants. In the first trial, the jury concluded that the defendants acted in self-defense. In the second trial, the jury concluded that the defendant's actions were based on political, rather than racial, motivations.

Survivors filed a civil suit in 1980, led by the [[Christic Institute]]{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}. The case in federal district court accused numerous police officers and four federal agents, as well as Klansmen and ANP members, of violating the civil rights of those killed, and it also charged the city with failure to protect the legal demonstration. The jury found the Klan/Nazi shooters liable for the death of Michael Nathan, the only non-CWP victim.&lt;ref name="nchp"/&gt; The jury also held the Greensboro Police Department responsible for failing to do more to prevent the shootings, because it was told by an informant that the KKK planned violence. These groups were ordered to pay a total of $350,000 in damages. This is one of the few times in US history when "a jury held local police liable for cooperating with the Ku Klux Klan in a [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death]]."&lt;ref&gt;Bermanzohn, Sally. "Introduction", ''Through Survivors' Eyes: From the Sixties to the Greensboro Massacre.'' Vanderbilt University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2004, marking the 25th anniversary of the killings, about 700 people marched through Greensboro to city hall, on the original route.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_25_on_20160314150804"&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2004/11/18/remembering_the_1979_greensboro_massacre_25 "Remembering the 1979 Greensboro Massacre: 25 Years Later Survivors Form Country's First Truth and Reconciliation Commission"], ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', 18 November 2004, accessed 14 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; That year, private citizens organized a [[Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], modeled after commissions in [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|South Africa]] and [[List of truth and reconciliation commissions|elsewhere]]. The intention was to investigate and hear testimony concerning the events of 1979. The organization failed to secure authority or local sanction when the mayor and most of the City Council voted against endorsing the undertaking. It lacked both subpoena power to compel testimony, and the ability to invoke the punishment of [[perjury]] for false testimony. The commission issued a Final Report concluding that, while both sides had contributed to the massacre by engaging in inflammatory rhetoric, the Klan and ANP members intended to inflict injury on protesters, and the police department had colluded with the Klan by allowing anticipated violence to take place. In 2009 the Greensboro City Council passed a resolution expressing regret for the deaths. In 2015 the city unveiled a historical marker to acknowledge the Greensboro Massacre. Three hundred people attended the ceremony. On August 15, 2017, the Greensboro City Council apologized for the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greensboro City Council apologizes for 1979 Greensboro Massacre|date=15 August 2017|url=https://triad-city-beat.com/greensboro-city-council-apologizes-citys-role/|website=Triad City Beat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--most of first paragraph and all of second paragraph need citations--&gt;
The [[Communist Workers' Party (United States)|Communist Workers' Party]] (CWP), which followed the policies of [[Mao Zedong]], had its origin in 1973 in New York as a splinter group of the [[Communist Party USA]]. "The CWP was one of several groups established as part of a [[Maoism|Maoist]] revival within the radical community. To the Maoists, the pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Communist Party USA was deemed to be soft on [[capitalism]] and lacking in militancy."&lt;ref name="nchp"&gt;[http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/commentary/195/entry Maximilian Longley, "Greensboro Shootings"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202323/http://northcarolinahistory.org/commentary/195/entry |date=March 13, 2016 }}, North Carolina History Project, [[John Locke Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt; Its leaders intended to increase activism in what they called the [[Workers Viewpoint Organization]] (WVO), along the Maoist model. In 1979, members of the CWP came to [[North Carolina]] in an attempt to [[Trade union|organize textile workers]]. In the [[Southern United States|South]], the communists had achieved little success with [[White Americans|white]] workers, so they shifted much of their attention to black textile workers. These efforts brought the CWP into conflict with a local [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapter, and the [[American Nazi Party]]. Some CWP members worked personally in the textile mills, including James Waller, who left his medical practice to do so. He became president of the local textile workers union. WVO members were active in Durham and Greensboro.

The WVO pushed back against [[racial discrimination]] in North Carolina by confronting a local Ku Klux Klan chapter. Hostility between the groups flared in July 1979, when protesters in [[China Grove, North Carolina]], disrupted a screening of ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'', a 1915 silent film by [[D. W. Griffith]] which portrayed the [[Reconstruction Era|era of Reconstruction]] and the formation of the Ku Klux Klan in heroic terms, and portrayed blacks in a demeaning, [[Racism|racist]] way. Taunts and inflammatory rhetoric were exchanged between members of the groups during the ensuing months.

In October 1979 the WVO renamed itself the [[Communist Workers Organization]]. It planned to stage a rally and a march against the Klan on November 3, 1979, in Greensboro. This was the county seat of Guilford County and it had been a site of major [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] actions in the 1960s, starting with sit-ins that resulted in the [[desegregation]] of lunch counters. Called the "Death to the Klan March" by the CWP, the event was scheduled to start in a predominantly black [[Public housing|housing project]] called Morningside Homes on the black side of town and from there it would proceed to the Greensboro City Hall.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite web| title='Death to the Klan' March|url=http://ncpedia.org/death-klan-march|work=NCpedia | publisher= [[North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources]]| accessdate= 26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Communist Workers' Party distributed flyers that "called for radical, even violent opposition to the Klan".&lt;ref name="Civil" /&gt; One flier said that the Klan "should be physically beaten and chased out of town. This is the only language they understand. Armed self-defense is the only defense."&lt;ref name="Civil" /&gt; Communist organizers publicly challenged the Klan to present themselves and "face the wrath of the people".&lt;ref name="chronology"&gt;{{cite web | title= Chronology of the November 3, 1979 Greensboro Massacre and its Aftermath | url=http://www.ibiblio.org/prism/jan98/chron.html | publisher=The Prism | accessdate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rally==
Four local TV news camera teams arrived at the Morningside Homes at the corner of Carver and Everitt streets to cover the protest march. Members of the CWP and other anti-Klan supporters gathered to rally the march, which was planned to proceed through the city to the Greensboro City Hall.

As the marchers collected, a caravan of ten cars (and a van) filled with an estimated 40 KKK and [[American Nazi Party]] members drove back and forth in front of the housing project. Several marchers beat the cars with picket sticks or threw rocks at them. In response, the KKK and ANP members got out of their cars, took [[shotgun]]s, [[rifle]]s and [[pistol]]s from the trunks, and fired into the crowd of protesters. Some of the latter were armed with [[handgun]]s, which they fired during the brief conflict.&lt;ref name="Civil"&gt;{{cite web | title= The Greensboro Massacre | url= https://library.uncg.edu/dp/crg/topicalessays/GreensMassacre.aspx| publisher= University of North Carolina – Greensboro| accessdate= 2014-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not entirely clear who fired the first shot.&lt;ref name="Civil" /&gt; Witnesses reported that KKK member Mark Sherer fired first, into the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission Final Report | url= http://www.greensborotrc.org/1979_sequence.pdf |accessdate = 2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] [[Frazier Glenn Miller]], the first shots were fired from a handgun by an anti-Klan demonstrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=F. Glenn Miller |title=A White Man Speaks Out |url=http://whty.org/book/06.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130416092535/http://whty.org/book/06.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 16, 2013 |date=March 6, 2005 |accessdate=2010-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KKK and American Nazi Party members quickly killed Cesar Cauce, James Waller, and Bill Sampson at the scene. Sandi Smith was shot between the eyes when she looked out from a place where she had taken shelter, and eleven others were wounded. Michael Nathan died of his wounds at the hospital.&lt;ref name="closure"&gt;{{cite news| author=Darryl Fears |title=Seeking Closure on 'Greensboro Massacre'  |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10392-2005Mar5.html |work=The Washington Post |date=March 6, 2005 |accessdate=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The filmed coverage of the shootings was carried on national and international news. It became known as the "Greensboro Massacre." Smith was black, Cauce was [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]], and the other three men who were killed were white. Both blacks and whites were wounded.

===Role of the police===
By the late 1970s, most police departments had become familiar with handling demonstrations, especially in cities such as Greensboro where numerous civil rights events had taken place since 1960. CWP march organizers had filed their plans for this march with the police and gained permission to hold it. Police generally covered such formal events in order to prevent outbreaks of violence; few officers were present during this march. A police photographer and a detective followed the Klan and [[neo-Nazi]] caravan to the site, but they did not attempt to intervene in events.

Edward Dawson, a Klansman-turned police informant,&lt;ref name="democracy"/&gt; was riding in the lead car of the caravan.&lt;ref name="closure"/&gt; He had been an FBI informant beginning in 1969 as part of the agency's [[COINTELPRO]] program and was among the founders of the North Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan when the North Carolina chapter of the [[United Klans of America]] split.&lt;ref name="wheaton12"&gt;Wheaton (1983), ''Codename GREENKIL'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; By 1979 he was working as an informant for the Greensboro Police Department. He was given a copy of the march route by the police and informed them of the potential for violence.&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt;  Because the police were absent, the attackers escaped with relative ease.

Bernard Butkovich, an undercover agent for the US [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (ATF), had infiltrated a unit of the American Nazi Party (ANP) during this period. This group had been formed by [[Frank Collin]], who had been ousted from the [[National Socialist White People's Party]]. The ANP members joined with the KKK chapter to disrupt the November 1979 protest march. At the 1980 criminal trial, the neo-Nazis claimed that Butkovich encouraged them to carry firearms to the demonstration. At the 1985 civil trial, Butkovich testified that he was aware that the Klansmen and the ANP members intended to confront the demonstrators; he did not tell the police or any other law enforcement agency.&lt;ref name="agent"&gt;{{cite news|title=Agent Tells of '79 Threats by Klan and Nazis  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/12/us/agent-tells-of-79-threats-by-klan-and-nazis.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |at=section 1, page 26, column 1 |date=May 12, 1985 |accessdate=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
A funeral was held on November 11, 1979, followed by a procession in which 200–400 people marched through the city to Maplewood Cemetery. There was controversy over whether or not the funeral should be held, but the city had arranged for full coverage by the police force and hundreds of armed [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] troops.&lt;ref&gt;"Greensboro Massacre", Civil Rights Greensboro'', website and database, Library, University of North Carolina Greensboro&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gravestone===
The four white men were buried in the traditionally all-black cemetery near Morningside. The inscription intended for their memorial was initially opposed by the city council, citing new ordinances banning political speech in that context. With support from the North Carolina [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] they were able to move forward one year later, commemorating the fallen with the following message:

{{quote|On November 3, 1979 the criminal monopoly capitalist class murdered Jim Waller, César Cauce, Mike Nathan, Bill Sampson, and Sandi Smith with government agents, Klan, and Nazis. Heroically defending the people, the 5 charged gunfire with bare fists and sticks. We vow this [[assassination]] will be the costliest mistake the capitalists have ever made, and the turning point of [[Class conflict|class struggle]] in the U.S.

The CWP 5 were among the strongest leaders of their times. Their deaths marked an end to capitalist stabilization (1950s–1970s) when American workers suffered untold misery, yet as a whole remained dormant for lack of its own leaders. In 1980 the deepest capitalist crisis began. The working class was awakening. The CWP 5 lived and died for all workers, minorities, and poor; for a world where [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and [[oppression]] will be eliminated, and all mankind freed; for the noble goal of [[communism]]. Their deaths, a tremendous loss to the CWP and to their families, are a clarion call to the U.S. people to fight for the workers' rule. In their footsteps waves of revolutionaries will rise and join our ranks.

We will overthrow the rule of the monopoly capitalist class! Victory will be ours!

===Legal proceedings===

The Greensboro Justice Fund was founded by families of the victims and their supporters shortly after November 3, 1979, in order to support litigation and public education related to the events and civil rights violations. Members of the Board of Directors were: [[Phillip Berrigan]], anti-war activist; Rev. [[Benjamin Chavis|Ben Chavis]], [[United Church of Christ]], member of the [[Wilmington 10]]; [[Michio Kaku]], PhD., nuclear physicist and [[Anti-nuclear movement in the United States|anti-nuke]] activist; [[Elizabeth McAlister]], anti-war activist; Martha Nathan, MD, widow of Dr. Michael Nathan, among the five dead; Neil Prose, MD, occupational health and safety activist; and Phil Thompson, CWP. Dr. Prose was the Justice Fund's first national executive director, and Dr. "Marty" Nathan succeeded him.&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;[http://libcdm1.uncg.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/CivilRights/id/2643/rec/1 "The Greensboro Justice Fund" 1.5.184-01], Civil Rights Greensboro website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Justice Fund retained civil rights lawyers to bring suit on behalf of the victims. They filed a Federal Civil Rights Act Complaint in Federal District Court in Greensboro in November 1980. The legal team at the time was made up of:&lt;ref name="justice"/&gt;
*Carolyn McAllaster, N.C. Civil Liberties Union State Board member, Thompson &amp; McAllaster, Durham, N.C.
*Dennis Cunningham, lead attorney in the 1970 [[Fred Hampton]] wrongful death civil suit (finally concluded and settled by the City of Chicago in 1982), [[People's Law Office]], Chicago, Illinois
*Dan Sheehan, lead attorney in the [[Karen Silkwood]] suit, and Lewis Pitts, both with the [[Christic Institute]], Washington, D.C.
*[[Susan Sturm]], ACLU National Office, New York, New York
*James McNamara, expert on Klan/Nazi history, Ohio
*Stewart Kwoh and Thomas Ono, Kwoh &amp; Ono, Los Angeles, California
*Eugene Scheiman, Baer Marks &amp; Upham, New York, New York
*Gayle Korotkin and Earle Tockman, Greensboro Justice Fund, Greensboro

===State prosecution===
Forty Klansmen and neo-Nazis, and several CWP marchers were said to have taken part in the shootings. The police arrested 16 Klansmen and Nazis, and several CWP members. The FBI started an investigation which it called GREENKIL (Greensboro Killings), turning over evidence it gathered to the state of North Carolina for its murder trial.&lt;ref name="wheaton"/&gt; The state attorney prosecuted the six strongest criminal cases first, charging five Klansmen with murder: David Wayne Matthews, Jerry Paul Smith, Jack Wilson Fowler, Harold Dean Flowers, and Billy Joe Franklin. One was charged with a lesser crime.&lt;ref name="democracy"&gt;{{cite web

The Department of Justice through the FBI had an extensive criminal investigation underway.&lt;ref name="wheaton"/&gt; After the acquittals in 1980, the FBI re-opened its investigation in preparation for a federal prosecution.

Six other men were charged with "conspiracy to violate the demonstrators' civil rights::"&lt;ref name="acquittal"/&gt; [[Virgil Lee Griffin]], Sr.; Eddie Dawson (also a police informant), Roland Wayne Wood, Roy Clinton Toney, Coleman Blair Pridmore,&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.uncg.edu/dp/crg/personBio.aspx?c=529 Civil Rights Greensboro: Coleman Blair Pridmore].

The CWP believed that the indictment was drawn too narrowly, giving the defense an opportunity to argue that political opposition to [[Communism]], rather than racial motivations, prompted the confrontation.&lt;ref name="acquittal"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/18/opinion/acquittal-in-greensboro.html | title=Opinion: Acquittal in Greensboro  |work=The New York Times | date= April 18, 1984 | accessdate =2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither trial "investigated the actions of Federal agents or the Greensboro police."

===''Waller v. Butkovich''===
In 1980, survivors filed a civil suit in [[Federal District Court]] seeking $48 million in damages.&lt;ref name="death" /&gt; The [[Christic Institute]] led the legal effort.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The complaint alleged that law-enforcement officials knew "that Klansmen and Nazis would use violence to disrupt the demonstration by Communist labor organizers and black residents of Greensboro but deliberately failed to protect them."&lt;ref name="nyt85"/&gt; Four federal agents were named as defendants in the suit, in addition to 36 Greensboro police and municipal officials, and 20 Klansmen and members of the American Nazi Party.&lt;ref name="nyt85"/&gt; Among the federal defendants was Bernard Butkovich of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]], who had worked as an undercover agent in 1979 and infiltrated one of the American Nazi Party chapters about three months before the protest. He testified that a Klansmen had referred in a planning meeting to using pipe bombs for possible assaults at the rally, and that he took no further action.&lt;ref name="nyt85"/&gt;

The Christic legal team was led by attorneys Lewis Pitts and [[Daniel Sheehan (attorney)|Daniel Sheehan]], together with [[People's Law Office]] attorney [[G. Flint Taylor]] and attorney Carolyn MacAllister of [[Durham, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="library.uncg.edu"&gt;[http://library.uncg.edu/dp/crg/topicalessays/GreensMassacre.aspx "Civil Rights Greensboro: Greensboro Massacre].

She chose to donate some money to grassroots efforts for social justice and education.&lt;ref name="library.uncg.edu"/&gt;

==25th anniversary events==
The CWP gradually dissolved, and its members went on to other pursuits. In November 2004, nearly 700 people, including several survivors, marched in Greensboro along the original planned route from the housing project to Greensboro City Hall to mark the 25th anniversary of the event.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_25_on_20160314150804"/&gt;

That year, a group of private citizens founded the [[Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission]]. They appealed to the Mayor and the City Council for their endorsement, but failed to gain support. The Greensboro City Council, led by mayor [[Keith Holliday (mayor)|Keith Holliday]], voted 6 to 3 against endorsing the work of the group. The three African-American members of the Council voted in favor of the measure.&lt;ref name="truth"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cehd.umn.edu/ssw/rjp/resources/rj_dialogue_resources/RJ_Dialogue%20Approaches/Can_Truth_Commissions_be_Effective_US.pdf | title = Can Truth Commissions be Effective in the United States?

The private group announced that the Commission would take public testimony and conduct an investigation, in order to examine the causes and consequences of the massacre. It was patterned after official [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission]]s, generally organized by national governments, such as that notably conducted in post-[[apartheid]] [[South Africa]]. But, the Greensboro commission had no official recognition and authority. It lacked both the power of subpoena to compel testimony, and the ability to invoke the penalty of [[perjury]] for false testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jovanovic|first1=Spoma|title=Communication for Reconciliation: Grassroots Work for Community Change|url=https://www.clarku.edu/peacepsychology/Jovanovic.pdf|website=Society for the Study of Peace, Conflict, and Violence: Peace Psychology Division of the American Psychological Association|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Greensboro TRC Truth and Reconciliation 2012-12-09'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greensborotrc.org/truth_reconciliation.php |title=What is Truth and Reconciliation? |accessdate=8 Dec 2012 |author=The Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311173734/http://www.greensborotrc.org/truth_reconciliation.php |archivedate=March 11, 2012 |quote=The most famous is the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission ... one of the chief architects of South Africa's truth commission founded the International Center for Transitional Justice in 2001 in order to advise the governments of other nations on how to best employ the process. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Process - how many people testified, quality of coverage, local and national reaction? --&gt;The Commission reported its findings and conclusions. It noted that both the Communist Workers Party and the Klan contributed in varying degrees to the violence, especially given the violent rhetoric which they had been espousing for months leading up to the confrontation at the march. It said that the protesters, most of whom did not live in Greensboro or the county, had not fully secured the community support of the Morningside Homes residents for holding the event there. Many of the residents did not approve of the protest because they feared it had the risk of catalyzing violence on their doorsteps. The Commission concluded that the KKK and ANP members went to the rally intending to provoke a violent confrontation, and that they fired on demonstrators with intent of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greensborotrc.org/1979_planning.pdf|title = Intelligence gathering and planning for the anti-Klan campaign |work= Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission Final Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its Final Report, the Commission noted the importance of the Greensboro Police Department's absence from the scene. The presence of police at previous confrontations between the same groups had resulted in no violence.  There had been testimony at the Commission that the Greensboro Police Department had infiltrated the Klan and, through a paid informant, knew of the white supremacists' plans and the strong potential for violence that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.greensborotrc.org/post1979_investigation.pdf|title = Police Internal Affairs Investigation: Making the facts known?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The informant had formerly been on the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s payroll and maintained contact with his agent's supervisor.

'''Thomas Hale Boggs Sr.''' (February 15, 1914 – disappeared October 16, 1972) was an American [[Democratic party (United States)|Democratic]] [[politician]] and a member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. He was the [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House majority leader]] and a member of the [[Warren Commission]].

In 1972, while he was still majority leader, the twin engine airplane in which Boggs was travelling with congressman [[Nick Begich]], of [[Alaska]], and two others, disappeared while flying from [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], Alaska.

==Early start in politics==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
Born in [[Long Beach, Mississippi|Long Beach]] in [[Harrison County, Mississippi|Harrison County]] on the [[Mississippi]] [[Gulf Coast]], Boggs was educated at [[Tulane University]] where he received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[journalism]] in 1934 and a [[law]] degree in 1937. He first practiced law in New Orleans but soon became a leader in the movement to break the power of the [[political machine]] of [[U.S. Senator]] [[Huey Pierce Long, Jr.]], who was assassinated in 1935. Long had previously broken the power of New Orleans politicians in 1929.

A [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]], Boggs was elected to the U.S. House for the Second District and served from 1941 to 1943. At the time he was elected he was, at twenty-six, the youngest member of Congress. After an unsuccessful re-election bid in 1942, Boggs joined the [[United States Navy]] as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]. He served the remainder of [[World War II]].

==Political career==

===Gubernatorial bid===

After the war, Boggs began his political comeback. He was again elected to Congress in 1946 and was then re-elected thirteen times, once just after he disappeared, but before he was presumed dead. In 1951, Boggs launched an ill-fated campaign for [[governor of Louisiana]]. Leading in the polls early in the campaign, he was soon put on the defensive when another candidate, [[Lucille May Grace]], at the urging of long-time Louisiana [[political boss]] [[Leander Perez]], questioned Boggs' membership in the [[American Student Union]] in the 1930s. By 1951, the ASU was thought to be a [[Communist]] front. Boggs avoided the question and attacked both Grace and Perez for conducting a smear campaign against him. In his book, ''The Big Lie'', author [[Garry Boulard]] suggests strongly that Boggs was a member of the ASU but tried to cover up that fact in the different political climate of the early 1950s.

Boggs finished third in the balloting for governor early in 1952. The Boggs candidate for lieutenant governor, [[C.E. "Cap" Barham]] of [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]], prevailed in a [[runoff election|runoff]] election against future Governor [[John McKeithen]]. The Boggs choice for register of state lands, [[Ellen Bryan Moore]] of Baton Rouge, won the office vacated by Lucille May Grace. Moore defeated [[Mary Evelyn Parker|Mary Evelyn Dickerson]], future state treasurer in the second McKeithen administration. Two other Boggs candidates were defeated, including State Senator [[Chester J. Coco]] of [[Marksville, Louisiana|Marksville]] for [[Attorney General of Louisiana|attorney general]], who lost to [[Fred S. LeBlanc]], the former [[List of mayors of Baton Rouge, Louisiana|mayor]] of [[Baton Rouge]], and [[Douglas Fowler]] of [[Coushatta, Louisiana|Coushatta]], defeated by [[Allison Kolb]] of Baton Rouge,&lt;ref&gt;"Boggs '52 ticket listed", ''Minden Herald'', October 19, 1951, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; who later switched to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] affiliation.

Boggs won the gubernatorial endorsement of the ''[[The Times (Shreveport)|Shreveport Times]]'', which hailed the representative for having stopped the [[Harry Truman|Truman]] administration from "altering oil-depletion allowances in federal taxation, thus blocking... efforts to tie a millstone around the neck of the petroleum industry of Louisiana."&lt;ref name=stimes&gt;''[[The Times (Shreveport)|Shreveport Times]]'', editorial, December 2, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;''The Times'', in a dig at Miss Grace, also cited Boggs' fight in Congress as early as 1941 against communism and subversion in government.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; Other newspapers supporting Boggs were the since defunct ''Monroe Morning World'' and the functioning ''[[The News-Star|Monroe News-Star]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Minden Press-Herald'', December 7, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Russell B. Long]] endorsed Boggs, but many in the Long faction had preferred Judge [[Carlos Spaht]] of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], who ultimately lost the [[runoff election]] to another judge, [[Robert F.

The ''[[New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'' endorsed not Boggs for governor but instead the fourth-place primary candidate, [[James M. McLemore]], a wealthy [[cattle]]man and auction barn owner from [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;''Minden Press'', January 11, 1952, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lionel Ott]], a member of the [[New Orleans City Council]], was the McLemore choice for lieutenant governor; Kennon's preference for lieutenant governor was Elmer David Conner (1905-1965) of [[Jennings, Louisiana|Jennings]], who in 1952 became the new administration's director of commerce and industry. Both Ott and Conner were eliminated in the primary.

The [[Boggs Act of 1952]], sponsored by Hale Boggs, set mandatory sentences for drug-related offenses. A first-offense conviction for marijuana possession carried a minimum sentence of 2 to 10 years with a fine of up to $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Marijuana timeline |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/dope/etc/cron.html |quote= |work=[[PBS]] |date= |accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later House elections===

In 1960, the Republican Elliot Ross Buckley, a cousin of [[William F. Buckley Jr.]], challenged Boggs but got only 22,818 votes (22 percent) to the incumbent's 81,034 ballots (78 percent). The [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]-[[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] ticket easily won in Louisiana that year.

In 1962, 1964, and 1968, [[David C. Treen]], a [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]] lawyer who became the first Louisiana Republican governor in 1980, challenged Boggs for reelection. Treen built on Buckley's efforts in the first contest, and [[Barry M. Goldwater|Goldwater]]'s momentum in Louisiana helped in the second race. It was in the 1968 election, however, that Treen fared the best: 77,633 votes (48.8 percent) to Boggs's 81,537 ballots (51.2 percent). Treen attributed Boggs's victory to the supporters of former [[Alabama]] [[Governor of Alabama|Governor]] [[George C. Wallace|George C. Wallace Jr.]], who ran for president on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket. Treen said that Wallace supporters "became very cool to my candidacy. We couldn't really believe they would support Boggs, but several Democratic organizations did come out for Wallace and Boggs, and he received just enough Wallace votes to give him the election.""Republican officials seemed convinced that fraudulent votes in some Orleans Parish precincts benefited Boggs and that Treen may have actually won the election.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} There were rumors {{Who|date=June 2009}} of election officials who cast votes for people who did not show up at the polls and signed for them in the precinct registers.

[[File:LBJ-Boggs.jpg|thumb|200px|right|President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] with House Majority Whip Boggs]]

During his tenure in Congress, Boggs was an influential player in the government. After ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', he signed the [[Southern Manifesto]] condemning desegregation in the 1950s and opposed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. Unlike most other Southern Representatives, however, he supported the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] and the [[Open Housing Act of 1968]]. He was instrumental in passage of the [[interstate highway]] program in 1956.

Boggs was the youngest member of the [[Warren Commission]] that investigated the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] from 1963 to 1964.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune; September 28, 1964"&gt;{{cite news |date=September 28, 1964 |title=Sketches of 7 on Oswald Panel; General Counsel Rankin Plays Active Role |script-title= |trans-title= |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/09/28/page/8/article/sketches-of-7-on-oswald-panel |work=Chicago Tribune |volume=118 |issue=272 |edition=Final |at=Section 1, page 8 |access-date=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boggs has been reported to have differing positions regarding the Warren report.  Based upon Office of the House Historian and Clerk of the House Office of Art and Archives, Politico reports that "Boggs dissented from the commission's majority report which supported the single bullet thesis — pointing to a lone assassin. Boggs said he "had strong doubts about it."{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} But in a 1966 appearance on ''[[Face the Nation]]'', Boggs defended the Commission's findings and stated that he did not doubt that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] killed Kennedy.&lt;ref name="Lodi News-Sentinel; November 28, 1966"&gt;{{cite news | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | title=Another Member of The Warren Commission Defends Findings | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JGgzAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4904%2C4778000 | newspaper=Lodi News-Sentinel | agency=UPI | page=8 | location=Lodi, California | date=November 28, 1966 | access-date=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarasota Journal; November 28, 1966"&gt;{{cite news | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | title=Boggs Says Assassination Data Complete | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lxQhAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7278%2C3847028 | newspaper=Sarasota Journal | agency=AP | page=28 | location=Sarasota, Florida | date=November 28, 1966 | access-date=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that all the evidence indicated that Kennedy was shot from behind and that the argument that one bullet hit both Kennedy and [[Texas Governor]] [[John Connally]] was "very persuasive."&lt;ref name="Sarasota Journal; November 28, 1966"/&gt; Boggs took issue with the assertions of Warren Commission critics and stated that it was "[[human nature]]" that "many people would prefer to believe there was a conspiracy."&lt;ref name="Lodi News-Sentinel; November 28, 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarasota Journal; November 28, 1966"/&gt;  It is unknown why his position was stated in such opposite terms but conspiracy theorists have pondered that difference as significant.

In the 1979 novel "The Matarese Circle" author Robert Ludlum portrayed Boggs as having been killed to stop his probe into the assassination."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/hale-boggs-plane-vanishes-in-alaska-oct-16-1972-229692&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as [[House Majority Whip|majority whip]] from 1962 to 1971 and as majority leader from January 1971 to his disappearance. As the whip, he ushered much of President Johnson's [[Great Society]] legislation through Congress.

On August 22, 1968, while Secretary of State Dean Rusk was testifying in a hearing concerning the Vietnam War, Boggs interrupted the session to announce the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia]] by the troops of the [[Soviet Union]], after hearing of a recent Radio Prague broadcast telling the Czechoslovaks not to take any action against the occupying forces. That caused Secretary Rusk, who was previously unaware of the situation, to excuse himself immediately, mid-testimony, to attend to the issue of the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/speeches/soviets-invade-during-prague-spring#soviets-invade-during-prague-spring|title=U.S. Receives News of Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia — History.com Audio|work=History.com|accessdate=7 September 2014|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909000318/http://www.history.com/speeches/soviets-invade-during-prague-spring#soviets-invade-during-prague-spring|archivedate=9 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Source: [[Walter Cronkite]]: ''The Way It Was: The 1960s'')

In April 1971, he made a speech on the floor of the House in which he strongly attacked [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] and the whole of the FBI.

That led to a conversation on April 6, 1971 between President [[Richard M. Nixon]] and the Republican minority leader, [[Gerald R. Ford, Jr.]]. Nixon said that he could no longer take counsel from Boggs as a senior member of Congress. In the recording of this call, Nixon asked Ford to arrange for the House delegation to include an alternative to Boggs. Ford speculated that Boggs is on pills as well as alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2006-12-29/news/0612281242_1_ford-s-white-house-iraq-mr-president/2 | title=Transcripts show Ford, Nixon were close allies | first=Bob | last=Woodward | date=29 December 2006 | work=[[Sun-Sentinel]] | location=[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month, Boggs went even further:
"Over the postwar years, we have granted to the elite and secret police within our system vast new powers over the lives and liberties of the people. At the request of the trusted and respected heads of those forces, and their appeal to the necessities of national security, we have exempted those grants of power from due accounting and strict surveillance."

==Disappearance in Alaska==
===Disappearance and search===
As majority leader, Boggs often campaigned for others. It was also in his interest to cultivate support from those Congressmen who had voted against him for majority leader, as Representative [[Nick Begich]] of [[Alaska]] had done in 1970.  On October 16, 1972, Boggs was aboard a twin engine [[Cessna 310]] with Representative Begich, who was facing a possible tight race in the November 1972 general election against the Republican candidate, [[Don Young]], when it disappeared during a flight from [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]]. Also on board were Begich's aide, Russell Brown; and the pilot, Don Jonz;&lt;ref name=FamousMissing&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-04-15|url=http://www.check-six.com/lib/Famous_Missing/Boggs.htm|title=Hale Boggs — Missing in Alaska |work=Famous Missing Aircraft|publisher=Check-Six}}&lt;/ref&gt; the four were heading to a campaign fundraiser for Begich.

The search for the missing aircraft and four men included the US [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], [[Civil Air Patrol]] and civilian fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;National Transportation Safety Board Report ''NTSB-AAR-73-1, January 31, 1973; Aircraft Accident Report, Pan Alaska Airways, Ltd., Cessna 310C, N1812H, Missing Between Anchorage and Juneau, Alaska, October 16, 1972''; page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cessna was required to carry an [[Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station|emergency locator transmitter]] per Alaska state statutes section 02.35.115, Downed Aircraft Transmitting Devices, which took effect on September 6, 1972,&lt;ref&gt;''Fairbanks Daily News-Miner'', Fairbanks, Alaska, Wednesday September 6, 1972, page 20, column 9&lt;/ref&gt; five weeks before the plane disappeared. This statute incorporated by reference, except for the effective date, [[Federal Aviation Regulations|Federal Aviation Regulation]] 91.52, which mandated emergency location transmitters on most non-jet powered fixed wing civil aircraft, including those used for air taxi and charter services. FAR 91.52, published on September 21, 1971, had an effective date of December 30, 1973 for existing aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;''Federal Register'', Volume 36, Number 50, March 13, 1971, pages 4,878 to 4,881&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FR 36-183, September 21, 1971, pages 18,716 to 18,725&lt;/ref&gt;

No emergency transmission signal determined to be from the plane was heard during the search. In its report on the incident, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] stated that the pilot's portable emergency transmitter, permissible in lieu of a fixed transmitter on the plane, was found in an aircraft at Fairbanks, Alaska. The report also notes that a witness saw an unidentified object in the pilot's briefcase that resembled, except for color, the portable emergency transmitter. The safety board concluded that neither the pilot nor aircraft had an emergency location transmitter.&lt;ref&gt;National Transportation Safety Board Report ''NTSB-AAR-73-1, January 31, 1973''; pages 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 24, 1972, the search was suspended after 39 days. Neither the wreckage of the plane nor the pilot's and passengers' remains were ever found.

After Boggs and Begich were re-elected posthumously that November, House Resolution 1 of January 3, 1973 officially recognized Boggs's [[declared death in absentia|presumed death]] and opened the way for a [[special election]]. The same was done for Begich.

===Speculation, suspicions, and theories===
The events surrounding Boggs's death have been the subject of much speculation, suspicion, and numerous [[conspiracy theories]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The theories often center on his membership on the [[Warren Commission]]. Boggs dissented from the Warren Commission's majority who supported the [[single bullet theory]]. Regarding the single-bullet theory, Boggs commented, "I had strong doubts about it."&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Edward J. ''Inquest'', (New York: Viking Press, 1966), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1979 novel ''[[The Matarese Circle]]'', author [[Robert Ludlum]] portrayed Boggs as having been killed to stop his investigation of the Kennedy assassination.

==Family==
In 1973, Boggs' wife since 1938, [[Lindy Boggs|Lindy]], was elected as a Democrat to the 93rd Congress, by special election, to the second district seat left vacant by her husband's death.&lt;ref&gt;Boggs, Lindy, with Katherine Hatch. Washington Through a Purple Veil: Memoirs of a Southern Woman. New York: Harcourt Brace and Co., 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; She was reelected to the eight succeeding Congresses (March 20, 1973 – January 3, 1991) and retired after the 1990 election.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrell, Thomas H., and Judith Haydel. "Hale and Lindy Boggs: Louisiana's National Democrats." ''Louisiana History'' 35 (Fall 1994): 389-402.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boggs, Lindy, with Katherine Hatch. ''Washington Through a Purple Veil: Memoirs of a Southern Woman''. New York: Harcourt Brace and Co., 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, President [[Bill Clinton]] appointed Lindy Boggs [[U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See]], in which capacity she served until 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Michael. Having Her Say at The See. (2000, June 4). ''New York Times'', p. 662.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hale and Lindy Boggs had four children: U.S. TV and public radio journalist [[Cokie Roberts]], born December 27, 1943, and the wife of journalist [[Steven V. Roberts]]; [[Thomas Hale Boggs, Jr.]], a prominent Washington, D.C.,-based [[lawyer|attorney]] and lobbyist; [[Barbara Boggs Sigmund]], who served as mayor of [[Princeton, New Jersey]]; and William Robertson Boggs, who died as an infant on December 28, 1946. In 1982 Mrs. Sigmund lost a bid for the Democratic nomination for the [[U.S. Senate]] to [[Frank Lautenberg]].

Boggs was a practicing Catholic.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robert|first1=Cokie|author-link1=Cokie Roberts|year=2008|chapter=Cokie Roberts|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6yQZpEOhrYC&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage|editor1-last=Kennedy|editor1-first=Kerry|editor1-link=Kerry Kennedy|title=Being Catholic Now: Prominent Americans Talk about Change in the Church and the Quest for Meaning |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6yQZpEOhrYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|location=New York|publisher=Three Rivers Press|page=26|isbn=9780307346858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tributes==
The [[Hale Boggs Memorial Bridge]], which spans the [[Mississippi River]] in [[St. Charles Parish]], is named in memory of the former congressman.  The visitor center at [[Portage Glacier]] in [[Southcentral Alaska]] (located within [[Chugach National Forest]]) is named the Begich, Boggs Visitor Center. The [[Hale Boggs Federal Complex]], at 500 [[Poydras Street]] in New Orleans, is also named after him.

In 1993, Boggs was among thirteen politicians, past and present, inducted into the first class of the new [[Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame]] in [[Winnfield, Louisiana|Winnfield]].

The '''Haraldskær Woman''' (or '''Haraldskjaer Woman''') is a [[bog body]] of a woman found naturally preserved in a [[bog]] in [[Jutland]], [[Denmark]], and dating from about 490 BCE ([[pre-Roman Iron Age]]).&lt;ref name="Døden i mosen"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Ebbesen |first1= Klaus |authorlink1= | title= Døden i mosen |trans-title=|year= 1986 |publisher= Carlsen’s Forlag |location= Copenhagen |language=Danish |isbn= 978-87-562-3369-9 |oclc= 18616344 |doi= |id= |page= 7 |pages= |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="images"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aldhouse-Green |first1=Miranda J |authorlink1=Miranda Aldhouse-Green |title= An archaeology of images |trans-title=Iconology and cosmology in Iron Age and Roman Europe |year= 2004|publisher=Routledge |location= London/New York|language= |isbn=0-415-25253-9 |oclc= 53099015 |doi= |id= |page= 93|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers found the body in 1835 while excavating [[peat]] on the Haraldskær Estate. The [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] conditions and acids of the peat bog contributed to the body's excellent preservation. Not only was the intact [[skeleton]] found, but so were the skin and internal organs. Scientists settled disputes about the age and identity of this well preserved body in 1977, when [[radiocarbon dating]] determined conclusively that the woman's death occurred around the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Archaeological Institute "[http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/bog/gunhild.html Haraldskaer Woman: Bodies of the Bogs]", ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'', [[Archaeological Institute of America]], December 10, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haraldskær Woman's body is on permanent display in an ornate glass-covered [[sarcophagus]] inside [[St. Nicolai Church]] in central [[Vejle]], Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= John D. Rambow |editor1-last= Fodor |editor1-link= |others= |title=Denmark |trans-title=the guide for all budgets, completely updated |series=Fodor's Scandinavia |volume= |date= |year=2002 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Fodor's |location=New York/London |language= |isbn= 0-676-90203-0 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mistaken identity==
[[File:Stnicolaschurch.jpg|thumb|125px|left|[[St. Nicolai Church]] in [[Vejle]], [[Denmark]]]]
After discovery of the body, early theories of her identity centered on the persona of [[Gunnhild Mother of Kings|Queen Gunnhild of Norway]], who lived around 1000 CE. Most of the bog bodies recovered indicate the victim died from a violent murder or ritualistic sacrifice.  These theories are consistent with the body being put into a bog as opposed to burial in dry earth.

According to the ''[[Jomsvikinga Saga]]'', [[Harald Bluetooth]] of Denmark ordered Queen Gunnhild be drowned in a bog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens |last1= Ashley |first1= Julian |authorlink1= |last2= Lock |authorlink2= | coauthors= |year=1998 |publisher= Carroll &amp; Graf |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7867-0405-7 |page=443 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based upon the belief of her royal personage, [[Frederick VI of Denmark|King Frederick VI of Denmark-Norway]] commanded an elaborately carved [[sarcophagus]] to hold her body.

This careful treatment of the Haraldskær Woman's remains explains the excellent state of conservation of the corpse;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Archaeological Institute|1997|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; conversely, [[Tollund Man]], a later discovery, was not properly conserved and most of the body has been lost, leaving only the head as original remains in his display.

In 1842, the young Danish [[archaeologist]] [[Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae|J. J. A. Worsaae]] disputed the identification of the Haraldskær Woman with Gunnhild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= From Genesis to Prehistory: The Archaeological Three Age System and Its Contested Reception in Denmark, Britain, and Ireland |last= Rowley-Conwy |first= Peter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2007|publisher = Oxford University Press |location= |isbn= 0-19-922774-8 |page= 70 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pioneer in [[archaeological stratigraphy]], Worsaae presented evidence the Haraldskær Woman dated from the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age|Iron Age]]. Later [[radiocarbon dating]] confirmed the body was not Gunnhild, but rather a woman of the early [[Pre-Roman Iron Age|Iron Age]] who lived about 490 BCE.&lt;ref name="Døden i mosen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="images"/&gt; Though no one proved the Haraldskær Woman has any royal lineage, her body lies in state in a display in the north [[transept]] of Saint Nicolai Church.

[[File:Gunhild or Lady of Haraldskær.jpg|220px|thumb|The body of the Haraldskær Woman]]
Excavators found the body of the Haraldskær Woman in a [[supine position]] in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her.&lt;ref name="Hvass"&gt;Hvass, Lone, ''Dronning Gunhild - et moselig fra jernalderen'', Sesam, (1998), p. 26. {{ISBN|87-7801-725-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down.&lt;ref name="aldhouse"&gt;Aldhouse-Green, Miranda, ''Boudica Britannia'', Pearson Education, 2006 pp. 95-96. {{ISBN|1-4058-1100-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Aldhouse|2004|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.&lt;ref name="Aldhouse-Green 2006 95-6"&gt;{{Harv|Aldhouse-Green|2006|pp=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, doctors at Århus Hospital undertook a further forensic examination of the Haraldskær Woman. By this time, the body had desiccated, shrunken, and the skin was leathery, severely wrinkled and folded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hvass|1998|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[CT-scan]] of the cranium more accurately determined her age to be about 40 at the time of her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hvass|1998|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body height now measured only {{height|m=1.33|precision=0}}, but doctors used the original 1835 descriptions to estimate she would have stood about {{height|m=1.50|precision=0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hvass|1998|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Lone Hvass of the Elsinore Museum, [[Miranda Aldhouse-Green]] of [[Cardiff University]], and the Department of Forensic Science at the [[University of Århus]] performed a re-examination of the Haraldskær Woman.&lt;ref name="Aldhouse-Green 2006 95-6"/&gt; Forensic analysis revealed stomach contents of unhusked [[millet]] and [[blackberries]]. Her neck had a faint groove as if someone applied a rope for torture or strangulation. The scientists concluded bog acids caused the swelling of the knee joint and that the woman was probably already dead before the branches pinned her down.&lt;ref name="Aldhouse-Green 2006 95-6"/&gt; Because of her careful placement, and since cremation was the prevailing mode of interment during that period in Jutland, the examiners guess the Haraldskær Woman was a victim of ritual sacrifice.&lt;ref name="Aldhouse-Green 2006 95-6"/&gt;

==Relation to other bog bodies==

The principal locations where bog bodies have been discovered are the Northern European countries of [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], the United Kingdom, [[Ireland]], and especially Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Karen E., ''Tales from the Bog'', National Geographic Magazine, September (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest of these bodies dates to about 8000 BCE, although the majority of specimens in Denmark are from the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] to [[Roman Iron Age]] era (about 500 BC to 400 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Christian: ''Tollundmanden. Gaven til guderne. Mosefund fra Danmarks forhistorie.'' Hovedland 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, more than 700&amp;nbsp;ancient bodies have been discovered in these sites,&lt;ref&gt;Hirst, Kris K.[http://archaeology.about.com/od/bterms/g/bogbodies.htm "Bog Bodies"], Archaeology, About.Com&lt;/ref&gt; although other estimates have placed the number in the thousands. It is difficult for scientists to ascertain a precise number because many of the bodies have been lost or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Knudsen, Anne, ''Moselig'', Weekendavisen, Nr. 40, 5-11, Oct. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Before archaeologists began actively searching for bog bodies, the bodies were discovered mostly during the routine extraction of peat, and then reburied or discarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Knudsen|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the discovery that systematic conservation of Iron Age bodies was attributable to the acidic anaerobic environs, major excavations have occurred in Jutland.&lt;ref&gt;Hamerow, Helena, 2003. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=r9W7nHtm4K0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Early Medieval Settlements: The Archaeology of Rural Communities in North-West Europe 400-900]'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-924697-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other bog bodies recovered on the Jutland peninsula which have undergone as extensive an analysis as the Haraldskær Woman include [[Tollund Man]], [[Grauballe Man]], [[Elling Woman]], [[Huldremose Woman]] and the [[Borremose Bodies|Borremose Woman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Fischer|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, S., Geertinger, P., "Bog Bodies Investigated in the Light of Forensic Medicine", ''Journal of Danish Archaeology'' Vol. 3 (1984), p. 111-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary references==

Danish author [[Steen Steensen Blicher]], an amateur archaeologist and one of the first to visit the site, made the first literary reference to the Haraldskær Woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hvass|1998|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836, he published his novella ''Gravhøjen'' which was a parody about a mistaken archaeological find. However, by 1841 Blicher seemed to have changed his mind about the Haraldskær Woman's identity when he wrote the poem ''Dronning Gunhild'', a lament for the dead queen in the bog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hvass|1998|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1846, the Danish playwright Jens Christian Hostrup wrote his comedy, ''A Sparrow Doing a Crane Dance'', (''En Spurv i Tranedans''), in which the ghost of Queen Gunnhild gives a magical ring to a scheming tailor and makes everyone blind to his actions.&lt;ref&gt;Hostrup, Jens Christian, ''En Spurv i Tranedans'', Folkecomedie i 4 akter, (1846)&lt;/ref&gt; Hostrup's play indirectly satirized the theory that the Haraldskær Woman was Queen Gunnhild, and became the first major public endorsement of Worsaae’s hypothesis.

==Development==

The ''MicrOmega'' [[mnemonic]] is derived from its French name ''Micro observatoire pour la mineralogie, l'eau, les glaces et l'activité'';&lt;ref name="Astro2017"/&gt; IR stands for [[infrared]].  It was developed by France's ''Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale'' at the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]. France has also flown MicrOmega on other missions such as the 2011 [[Fobos-Grunt]] and the ''[[Hayabusa2]]'' MASCOT mobile lander currently exploring [[162173 Ryugu|asteroid Ryugu]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://mascot.cnes.fr/en/MASCOT/GP_micromega.htm MicroMega Instrument for MASCOT]. [[CNES]], France. August 26, 2016. Accessed: 21 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; France is also developing a variant called MacrOmega Near-IR Spectrometer for the [[Martian Moons Exploration]] (MMX) lander, a Japanese [[sample-return mission]] to Mars' moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/topics/files/MMX170412_EN.pdf#page=19 Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) Mission Overview]. (PDF). [[JAXA]]. 10 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Principal Investigator]] of the MicrOmega-IR for the ExoMars rover is Jean-Pierre Bibring, a French astronomer and planetary scientist at the ''Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale''. Co-PIs are astrobiologists Frances Westall and Nicolas Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exploration.esa.int/mars/45103-rover-instruments/ The ExoMars Rover Instrument Suite - MicrOmega].

MicrOmega-IR is a visible and [[Hyperspectral imaging|infrared hyperspectral microscope]] that is designed to characterize the texture and composition of crushed samples presented to the instrument.&lt;ref name='Bibring 2017'&gt;[https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2016.1642 The MicrOmega Investigation Onboard ExoMars].

''Astrobiology'', Vol. 17, No. 6-7. 1 July 2017. {{doi|10.1089/ast.2016.1642}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its objective is to study mineral grain assemblages in detail to try to unravel their geological origin, structure and composition, including potential [[Organic compound|organics]].&lt;ref name='Bibring 2017'/&gt; These data will be vital for interpreting past and present geological processes and environments on Mars. Because MicrOmega-IR is an imaging instrument, it can also be used to identify grains that are particularly interesting, and assign them as targets for [[ExoMars (rover)#Pasteur instrument suite|Raman]] and [[Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer|MOMA]] observations.&lt;ref name='Bibring 2017'/&gt; 

It is composed of 2 microscopes: MicrOmega/VIS has a spatial sampling of approximately 4 μm, working in 4 colors in the visible range. The other one is the MicrOmega/NIR hyperspectral microscope working in the spectral range 0.95 μm - 3.65 μm with a spatial sampling of 20 μm per pixel.&lt;ref name=SciDir&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063309000026 Micromega/IR: Design and status of a near-infrared spectral microscope for in situ analysis of Mars samples].

'''Mike''' ({{circa}}1908&lt;ref&gt;Some sources have his date of birth as 1909. In the ''Evening Standard'' obituary, Wallis Budge says that Mike started hanging around the museum in 1910. However, in his foreword to the "Mike" pamphlet, Wallis Budge states that the cat appeared in the spring of 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; – January 1929) was a cat who guarded the gates of the [[British Museum]] whose fame was such that ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine devoted two articles to him on his death. [[E. A. Wallis Budge]]'s work describing the life of Mike has been viewed as the zenith of such biographical writing.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,738499,00.html "Animals: Budge on Mike"], ''Time'' magazine, 30 January 1930, retrieved 16 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
In the spring of 1908 "Black Jack", the house cat of the Museum, walked up to the Keeper of Egyptian antiquities [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] with a large object in his mouth which he then deposited at the Keeper's feet. The object was a kitten, later known as Mike. The following year Mike began to study under Black Jack who taught the younger cat to stalk pigeons by [[Pointing breed|pointing like a dog]]. Under Black Jack's guidance Mike would proceed to corner the pigeons, daze them, then bring them to the housekeeper, who would exchange the bird for a morsel of food and milk, and release them unharmed.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

==Later life==
Mike spent 20 years at the British Museum during which time he gained a certain notoriety for his [[misogynist]] tendencies, pushing away any attempt at fraternisation with females and having a dislike for dogs.  Mike would only allow certain people to feed him, those "''who treated him as a man and brother''". Interest in Mike spread such that he was described as "probably the most famed British feline of the 20th Century".&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

Mike retired from official duties in 1924, and was made a 'pensioner'. He continued to take an interest in the comings-and-goings at the Museum, and was especially active when it came to chasing off the occasional wandering dogs, who reportedly "fled in terror" when he attacked.

In 1927 Mike featured in an article in the ''Star'', which stated that: "He eyes the scholars{{mdash}}famous men from all countries{{mdash}}as philosophically as the later stream of mere curiosity-hunters. High School girls in trim uniform; London street urchins, who make the portico a playground; black-robed monks, gaily sari-ed Hindu ladies, dapper little Japs, and horn-spectacled tourists, are all alike to him."

When Mike died Wallis Budge contributed to the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' an obituary of  Mike which became the basis of his monograph "''Mike, the cat who assisted in keeping the main gate of the British Museum from February 1909 to January 1929''". This work includes an ode composed by F. C. W. Hiley which ends:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Old Mike! Farewell! We all regret you, 
:Although, you  would not let us pet you; 
:Of cats the wisest, oldest best cat, 
:This be  your motto — [[Requiescat]]!&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mike's tombstone was erected near the [[Great Russell Street]] entrance and the inscription reads: "He assisted in keeping the main gate of the British Museum from February 1909 to January 1929."&lt;ref name="time2"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,732230,00.html "Foreign News: Cat Mike"], ''Time'' magazine, 8 April 1929, retrieved 16 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monoembryony''' is the emergence of one and only one seedling from a [[seed]]. A seed giving two or more seedlings is [[polyembryonic]]. Some of the nuclear cells surrounding the [[embryo sac]] start dividing and protrude into the embryo sac and develop into embryos.

'''''Neoglyphea inopinata''''' is a species of [[Glypheoidea|glypheoid lobster]], a group thought long extinct before ''Neoglyphea'' was discovered. It is a [[lobster]]-like animal, up to around {{convert|15|cm}} in length, although without [[chela (organ)|claws]]. It is only known from 17 specimens, caught at two sites – one at the entrance to [[Manila Bay]] in the [[Philippines]], and one in the [[Timor Sea]], north of [[Australia]]. Due to the small number of specimens available, little is known about the species, but it appears to live up to five years, with a short [[crustacean larvae|larval]] phase. A second species, previously included in ''Neoglyphea'', is now placed in a separate genus, ''[[Laurentaeglyphea]]''.

==Taxonomy==
''Neoglyphea inopinata'' was named in 1975 by [[Jacques Forest]] and [[Michèle de Saint Laurent]] of the ''{{lang|fr|[[Muséum national d'histoire naturelle]]}}'' in Paris. It was based on a single damaged specimen that had been caught by the [[USS Albatross (1882)|USFC ''Albatross'']] in the [[Philippines]] in 1908, and deposited in the [[United States National Museum]].&lt;ref name="F81"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jacques Forest |author2=Michèle de Saint Laurent |author-link=Jacques Forest |author2-link=Michèle de Saint Laurent |last-author-amp=yes |year=1981 |chapter=La morphologie externe de ''Neoglyphea inopinata'', espèce actuelle de Crustacé Décapode Glyphéide |series=Résultats des Campagnes MUSORSTOM |title=Philippines (18–28 mars 1976) |publisher=Mémoires de l'Office de la Recherche scientifique et technique Outre-Mer |isbn=978-2-7099-0577-0 |volume=91 |pages=51–84, figs. 1–28 |url=http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_2/memoires/00590.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rafael Lemaitre |year=2006 |title=Rectification of the events leading to discovery and description of ''Neoglyphea inopinata'' Forest &amp; de Saint Laurent, 1975 |journal=[[Crustaceana]] |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=123–124 |url=http://decapoda.nhm.org/pdfs/18777/18777.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |doi=10.1163/156854006776759699}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Saint Laurent examined the unidentified specimen while working on [[Thalassinidea]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name="NMP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Zoology/Neoglyphea.html |title=''Neoglyphea inopinata'' |work=National Museum Collections |date=June 21, 2011 |publisher=[[National Museum of the Philippines]] |accessdate=December 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Neoglyphea'' means "new ''[[Glyphea]]''", while the [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:inopinatus|inopinata]]}}'' means "unexpected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J.

==Significance==
Until the discovery of ''Neoglyphea'', the Glypheoidea was thought to have died out before the end of the [[Eocene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jacques Forest |author-link=Jacques Forest |author2=[[Michèle de Saint Laurent]] &amp; [[Fenner A. Chace Jr.]] |year=1976 |title=''Neoglyphea inopinata'': a crustacean "living fossil" from the Philippines |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=192 |issue=4242 |page=884 |doi=10.1126/science.192.4242.884 |bibcode=1976Sci...192..884F |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/192/4242/884.full.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |pmid=17817762}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Ma|34}}. They had been thought to be closely related to [[spiny lobster]]s and [[slipper lobster]]s, with which they formed the group "Palinura". Study of non-fossil specimens made it apparent that the similarities between the two groups resulted from [[Analogy (biology)|analogy]], rather than [[Homology (biology)|homology]], and that Glypheoidea was closer to [[lobster]]s and [[crayfish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jacques Forest |author-link=Jacques Forest |year=2006 |title=Les glyphéides actuels et leur relation avec les formes fossiles (Decapoda, Reptantia) |language=French |trans-title=The Recent glypheids and their relationship with their fossil relatives (Decapoda, Reptantia) |journal=[[Crustaceana]] |volume=79 |issue=7 |pages=769–793 |doi=10.1163/156854006778008212 |url=http://decapoda.nhm.org/pdfs/15941/15941.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jacques Forest |author-link=Jacques Forest |year=2006 |title=The Recent glypheids and their relationship with their fossil relatives (Decapoda, Reptantia) |journal=[[Crustaceana]] |volume=79 |issue=7 |pages=795–820 |doi=10.1163/156854006778008221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schram_Ahyong"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frederick R.

''Neoglyphea'' has been caught in two distantly separated geographical areas. The initial specimens were from a small area at the entrance to [[Manila Bay]] at depths of {{convert|186|-|189|m}}. Three additional specimens have been recovered from a locality in the [[Timor Sea]] (near {{coord|9|46|S|130|0|E}}) at a depth of {{convert|240|-|300|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="MLW"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://wbd.etibioinformatics.nl/bis/lobsters.php?selected=beschrijving&amp;menuentry=soorten&amp;id=81 |chapter=''Neoglyphea inopinata'' (Fenix lobster) |page=89 |work=FAO Species Catalogue, Volume 13 |title=Marine Lobsters of the World |author=Lipke B. Holthuis |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |year=1991 |isbn=92-5-103027-8 |series=FAO Fisheries Synopsis No. 125 |authorlink=Lipke Holthuis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The overall length of the known specimens of ''Neoglyphea'' varies from {{convert|7|cm}} to {{convert|14.9|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="MLW"/&gt;

===Cephalothorax===
The [[cephalothorax]] is almost entirely covered by a [[carapace]], only the insertion of the eyestalks protruding slightly beyond it.&lt;ref name="F81"/&gt; A deep transverse groove, called the cervical groove, divides the anterior 40% of the carapace from the posterior 60%.&lt;ref name="F81"/&gt; At the front, the carapace bears a fairly long [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]], which is wide at the base, giving it a triangular outline when seen from above. From the side, it is curved in a weak S-shape, bending initially upwards, and then curving slightly forwards again.&lt;ref name="F81"/&gt; The cephalothorax becomes slightly wider behind the cervical groove.&lt;ref name="F81"/&gt; The carapace, including the rostrum, is covered with forward-pointing teeth (pointed [[tubercle (anatomy)|tubercles]]), including two rows side-by-side along the animal's midline;&lt;ref name="F81"/&gt; these rows bridge the cervical groove, but become weaker in the posterior half of the carapace.&lt;ref name="F81"/&gt; Beneath the carapace is a branchial chamber, containing 28 pairs of [[gill]]s.&lt;ref name="F81"/&gt;

The underside of the cephalothorax is dominated in the forward part by an unusually long epistome, which is a "most distinctive" feature of ''Neoglyphea''.&lt;ref name="Schram_Ahyong"/&gt; The epistome is effectively the [[sternite]] of the antennal segment, and lies between the base of the [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] and the beginning of the [[labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]].&lt;ref name="Schram_Ahyong"/&gt; In ''Neoglyphea'', it is 1.5 times longer than it is wide, and is broadly rectangular in outline.&lt;ref name="F81"/&gt; Like the carapace, it is covered in spiny tubercles, although they are smaller and straighter on the epistome. Two rows of larger spines diverge towards the rear of the epistome, leaving an area which is largely devoid of such spines.&lt;ref name="F81"/&gt;

===Abdomen===
The form of the abdomen of ''Neoglyphea'' is similar to that of [[lobster]]s and other long-bodied [[Decapoda|decapods]].&lt;ref name="F81"/&gt; Its first segment is less than half the length of the succeeding 6 segments.  The abdomen ends in a [[telson]], which is about 1.5 times as long as the other abdominal segments, flanked by a pair of [[uropod]]s. The uropods have similarly sized exopods and endopods, fringed with long hairs; the exopod is divided towards the end by a jointed diaeresis.&lt;ref name="F81"/&gt;

===Appendages===
Two separate eyestalks extend forwards from below the rostrum, each bearing a pigmented, movable [[compound eye]].&lt;ref name="MLW"/&gt; These are followed by two pairs of [[antenna (biology)|antennae]]. The first pair (the antennules) are biramous, with the two [[flagellum|flagella]] of similar size, one of 65 segments, and one of 50 segments; the second pair are uniramous and much thicker and longer than the first pair, reaching twice the length of the carapace.&lt;ref name="F81"/&gt; The antennal glands open at the base of the second antennae.&lt;ref name="F81"/&gt;

The animal's [[arthropod mouthparts|mouthparts]] comprise paired [[mandible]]s, maxillules, maxillae and three pairs of maxillipeds, although the third maxillipeds are very long and more closely resemble the walking legs than the other mouthparts.&lt;ref name="F81"/&gt; There are five pairs of walking legs, or pereiopods, diminishing in size from front to back. There are no [[chela (organ)|chelae]] (claws), although the last segment may be able to grip against an extension of the previous segment in some cases (subchelate).&lt;ref name="F81"/&gt; The first four pairs are similarly arranged, extending forwards and downwards to be used in walking; the fifth pair is directed upwards.&lt;ref name="F81"/&gt; The abdomen bears five pairs of [[pleopod]]s, of which the first are modified for use in copulation in the males.&lt;ref name="F81"/&gt;

===Sexual dimorphism===
''Neoglyphea inopinata'' shows a clear [[sexual dimorphism]] in the size and proportions of the first pereiopods and the shape of the abdominal pleurites. In males, the first pereiopods are markedly longer than in females, with most of the additional length occurring in the merus and propodus (third and fourth segments). The female merus is also wider, and bears three additional teeth towards its distal end. Males have pointed abdominal pleurites, in contrast to the more rounded shape seen in females. Both these forms of sexual dimorphism are also seen in fossil glypheids, such as ''[[Glyphea regleyana]]''.&lt;ref name="F89"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jacques Forest |author2=Michèle de Saint Laurent |author-link=Jacques Forest |author2-link=Michèle de Saint Laurent |last-author-amp=yes |year=1989 |chapter=Nouvelle contribution à la connaissance de ''Neoglyphea inopinata'' Forest &amp; de Saint Laurent, à propos de la description de la femelle adults |editor=J.

==Ecology==
''Neoglyphea'' appears to be most active during the daytime, since most of the known specimens were captured close to midday.&lt;ref name="F89"/&gt; Males may gather most of the food, while the females remain in their burrows; this would explain the small proportion of females among the captured specimens.&lt;ref name="F89"/&gt; The recovery of both males and females in May might suggest that this is the species' mating period.&lt;ref name="F89"/&gt; The relatively large size of the [[gonopore]]s of females suggests a large egg size, and thus reduced development and [[eclosion]] in a relatively advanced state.&lt;ref name="F89"/&gt; It is therefore likely that any [[plankton]]ic larval stage must be brief, which is also supported by the animal's apparently restricted distribution.&lt;ref name="F89"/&gt; Individuals appear to survive for up to five years at least, although longer lifespans cannot be excluded.&lt;ref name="F89"/&gt; All these details, although speculative, are similar to that seen in better-known species such as ''[[Nephrops norvegicus]]''.&lt;ref name="F89"/&gt;

Examination of the [[holotype]] revealed an infestation of parasitic [[copepod]]s in its gills; these were described as the new species ''[[Nicothoe tumulosa]]'' in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roger F. Cressey |year=1976 |title=''Nicothoe tumulosa'' a new siphonostome copepod parasitic on the unique decapod ''Neoglyphea inopinata'' Forest and de Saint Laurent |journal=[[Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington]] |volume=89 |issue=7 |pages=119–126 |url=http://biostor.org/reference/74177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neurohacking''' is the colloquial term for (usually personal or '[[DIY]]') [[neuroengineering]]. It is a form of [[Grinder (biohacking)|biohacking]] (qv) focusing on the brain and [[Central nervous system|CNS]]. Strictly speaking it is any method of manipulating or interfering with the structure and/or function of neurons for improvement or repair.

== Reasons ==

=== Mental health ===

The main goal of neurohacking is optimal mental health.  Other goals include damage repair, [[simulated reality]], prevention of disease and augmentation of abilities or of intelligence overall. It utilises information and technology mainly from the fields of [[epigenetics]], bio/neurofeedback, [[psychopharmacology]], biological psychology and functional analysis, but many practitioners also employ physical exercise, nutritional guidelines, vitamins &amp; supplements, meditation and/or self-hypnosis. Some avoid all neuroactive substances including caffeine, alcohol, food additives and fast-release sugars.
Current research focus on the nature and development of intelligence and how to increase or improve it. The works of Dr. Herman Epstein, Joseph LeDoux, Alex Ramonsky, Frederick Starr and David Barker are influential. The ethical basis of Neurohacking for health is that it should be practiced strictly with informed consent.

=== Human enhancement ===

There are numerous examples of the use of neural implants for therapy, however the only experiments involving hacking into the nervous system for enhancement appear to be those conducted by [[Kevin Warwick]]. In a series of experiments at the [[University of Reading]], Warwick became the first human recipient of a [[BrainGate]] electrode array implant on 14 March 2002, into the [[median nerve]] of his left arm. With this in place he was able to control a [[robot arm]] to copy his own hand movements.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Andrews, B, Teddy, P and Shad, A:“The Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems”, ''Archives of Neurology'', 60(10), pp1369-1373, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Warwick's nervous system was also connected with the internet in [[Columbia University]], New York to enable him to control the [[robot arm]] in the University of Reading, also receiving feedback from sensors in the finger tips. A simpler array was implanted into the arm of Warwick's wife. With this in place they were able to achieve the first direct electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thought Communication and Control: A First Step using Radiotelegraphy|journal=IEE Proceedings on Communications|volume=151|issue=3|pages=185|doi=10.1049/ip-com:20040409|year=2004|last1=Warwick|first1=K.|last2=Gasson|first2=M.|last3=Hutt|first3=B.|last4=Goodhew|first4=I.|last5=Kyberd|first5=P.|last6=Schulzrinne|first6=H.|last7=Wu|first7=X.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Information retrieval ===

The term neurohacking is also used for a method of attempting to retrieve information from the [[brain]] (such as passwords, locations, etc..) without consent; presently no technology exists for such a tactic. The concept has been used much in science fiction (e.g. the film "[[The Matrix]]"). In data retrieval, some sort of [[brain–computer interface]] (BCI) is typically used, where the brains [[neuron]] [[synapses]] are somehow captured or recorded to be processed for information. Promoters of this concept generally refer to the MRI ([[magnetic resonance imaging]]) or MEG ([[magnetoencephalography]]) to support the plausibility of this concept. Although some sort of [[neuroimaging]] could someday be used, the accuracy of any present day method is not nearly close enough. For instance, it is assumed that neurohacking requires detection of the state of individual neurons (approximately 1 [[micrometre|micrometer]] diameter) while the resolution of the MEG is several thousand neurons and other imaging systems may be even larger. It is estimated that usable neurohacking of this type is still many decades away.

== Modern applications ==
[[Caffeine]], alcohol, [[modafinil]], over the counter medicine, and other drugs are all forms of neurohacking. Every one of these substances alters or "tricks" the brain into desirable conditions. When ingesting caffeine, the brain is fooled into thinking the body has energy and keeps the consumer awake. The brain's neurons naturally produce [[adenosine]] as a byproduct which is monitored by the nervous system. Once the level of adenosine is at a certain point, the body will feel tired. Caffeine acts as fake adenosine and binds to the body's receptors. However, instead of disappearing, it blocks the adenosine receptors so the brain's stimulants, dopamine and glutamate, can work more freely. Since neurohacking is the interference with the structure and function of neurons, caffeine consumption is in fact a neurohack. Similarly, other substances that affect the brain and functions of neurons are also neurohacks.&lt;br/&gt;
Alcohol is an example for a form of neurohacking which affects multiple neurotransmitters instead of just one. This is because alcohol is a fat soluble molecule. Since lipids are a major component of cell membranes, alcohol is able to enter the membranes of neurons and change their properties. Specifically, alcohol inhibits the [[glutamate]] receptor function, enhances [[GABA]] receptor function, as well as raises [[dopamine]] and [[endorphin]] levels. This causes all sorts of reactions, including liveliness and excitement. Alcohol also causes one to lose their anxieties, because of the effect of alcohol on GABA receptors. After alcohol affects the system, it causes the body to go through what is called neurotransmitter rebound. This is because when alcohol takes effect, it overuses the GABA system, so when it wears off, the GABA system makes the body feel restless, resulting in its severe withdrawal symptoms.

'''Number Eight''' is a female humanoid [[Cylon (2003)|Cylon]] model on the television series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', a reimagining of the [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|classic show of the same name]]. She is portrayed by [[Grace Park (actress)|Grace Park]]. Two prominent Number Eight copies serving as ''[[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Galactica]]'' pilots are '''Sharon Valerii''' and '''Sharon Agathon''', using the [[Aviator call sign|call signs]] "'''Boomer'''" and "'''Athena'''", respectively.

==Notable copies==
Cylon models [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Six]] and Eight are the most common in the series. Many Number Eight copies have been seen in various roles, including leadership positions; two are featured as central characters — Boomer and Athena.

===Sharon "Boomer" Valerii===

{{More citations needed|date=June 2008}}

====Life on Caprica and Galactica====
Lieutenant Junior Grade Sharon "Boomer" Valerii is a [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylon]] [[sleeper agent]] programmed with false memories of being raised in the mining colony [[List of Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining) locations#Troy|Troy]] by parents Katherine and Abraham Valerii, who supposedly died in an accident that wiped out the colony population. Before the mini-series, Boomer and [[Galen Tyrol]] are romantically involved, which is against military protocol due to their ranks. Her programming leads her to black out and sabotage the ''Galactica'' on several occasions, which Tyrol unwittingly abets by hiding evidence implicating her. In "[[Kobol's Last Gleaming]]", [[William Adama|Commander Adama]] sends Boomer on a mission to destroy the Cylon basestar orbiting Kobol; and after her return, she shoots Adama twice in the chest, putting him in a coma and revealing her nature to the crew.

====Death and resurrection====
While Boomer is in the brig, [[Gaius Baltar]] manipulates her  into revealing how many other Cylons are hidden in the fleet. While Boomer is being transported from the brig, [[Cally Henderson Tyrol|Cally]] shoots and kills her.&lt;ref name="Resistance"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Resistance (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Resistance| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In  "[[Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)|Downloaded]]", Boomer's consciousness is downloaded into a new body in Cylon-occupied Caprica. She resists being identified with the Cylon cause despite being viewed as a hero alongside [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Caprica Six|Caprica Six]], and both she and Six decide to try to persuade the Cylons to reduce hostility against humans. Later in the series, Boomer appears among the Cylons occupying New Caprica as a member of the Cylon governing council controlling the human puppet government.

====Relation to Hera Agathon and second death====
In "[[The Eye of Jupiter (Battlestar Galactica)|The Eye of Jupiter]]", Boomer attempts to care for Athena's hybrid child [[Hera Agathon|Hera]] on the Cylon base ship, where the child ended up after the New Caprica evacuation. In a conflict with the visiting Athena over whether the humans negotiated in good faith, Boomer is killed by Caprica Six for endangering the child.

====Second resurrection and relation with John Cavil====
After resurrecting again, Boomer develops a relationship with [[John Cavil]], a Number One who embraces his machine nature and sees human traits as a weakness. Cavil enlists Boomer's support when the Cylon models become deadlocked in a vote over whether the Raiders should be lobotomized. Boomer also follows Cavil in his plan to destroy the opposing Cylons despite her doubts.

====Relation to Ellen Tigh and return to Galactica====
Boomer is the only other Cylon who knows that their creator, [[Ellen Tigh]], is being held prisoner by Cavil. When Cavil threatens to cut open Ellen's brain in order to access her knowledge about Resurrection technology, Boomer helps Ellen escape, but is immediately imprisoned after disembarking on the ''Galactica''. She escapes with the help of Tyrol, who is motivated by sentimentality.

{{Quote box
 | quote = "Did Boomer really love the Chief? That’s an interesting question and one I don’t have a neat answer to. Boomer is deeply conflicted. I think the process of having false memories planted in her, getting switched “on” as a Cylon, shooting Adama, getting shot by Cally, and her experiences on New Caprica have left her severely disturbed. She was determined to go through with her mission, but in the process of seducing Tyrol she reawakened feelings of love that she thought were dead. I think she experienced real misgivings just before she got on that Raptor, but felt she had gone too far to back down. Wrapped up in that is her perverse envy of Athena, who obtained everything Boomer once wanted, and this festered into a sick desire to strike out at Athena. It’s difficult to say someone who did that loves the Chief, and yet in her damaged way, I think she did and still does love him."

====Kidnapping of Hera Agathon====
While fleeing the ''Galactica'', Boomer impersonates Athena to kidnap Hera and bring her to Cavil for study.

{{Quote box
 | quote = "Boomer is much more tragic and conflicted, and in a lot of denial. Athena came from a very different starting point, and everything was a lie, but she fought and made it through the trenches. She's a story not of privilege, but about creating whoever you want to be. That's the American story. Boomer could have been a number of things too, but she made a lot of poor decisions."

====Final death====
On her way to Cavil, Boomer bonds with Hera, which leads to her turning against Cavil during the Colonial assault on the Cylon colony. After returning Hera to Athena and Helo, who were part of the boarding party, Boomer dies her final death when Athena shoots her.

====Dual personality mode====
[[Battlestar Galactica: The Plan]] reveals that the Cavil aboard the ''Galactica'' used an elephant figurine to trigger Boomer's sleeper nature. The self-aware Boomer reveals that her feelings for Tyrol and Admiral Adama were genuine and that she prefers her human personality. Some supporting characters believe that it was due to this conflict that when she shot Adama, she purposely aimed so that his death was not guaranteed.

===Sharon "Athena" Agathon ===

====Cylon-occupied Caprica====
A self-aware Number Eight first appears in the series on Cylon-occupied Caprica, where she impersonates the original Sharon and helps [[Karl Agathon|Karl 'Helo' Agathon]] to further a Cylon experiment that relies on having him fall in love with her. She eventually falls genuinely in love with Helo and tries to help him escape, during which he discovers her true identity. Sharon reveals that she is pregnant with his child, the first known successful attempt at a Cylon/human hybrid. While searching for a way off planet, the two encounter [[Kara Thrace|Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace]], who is on a mission to retrieve an important artifact. In a scuffle with Starbuck, Sharon flees in Starbuck's captured [[Cylon Raider]], but  later returns to help rescue Starbuck from a Cylon facility.

====Return to the Colonial Fleet====
Sharon uses her knowledge of the Tomb of Athena on Kobol as leverage to avoid immediate execution and consistently demonstrates her loyalty by defending the group from Cylon ambushes. Sharon's reunion with the ''Galactica'' personnel is tense due to Boomer's history with them, but she makes it clear that she is a separate consciousness and a different person from Boomer. Despite this, most of the crew still do not trust her. Sharon continues to act to defend the fleet against Cylon attacks, though she remains conflicted about her role in the destruction of her people.

====Pregnancy and birth====
Upon finding out about Sharon's pregnancy, President Roslin orders it terminated, but rescinds her decision when the fetal blood successfully cures her terminal cancer. Sharon gives birth to her child prematurely and names her [[Hera Agathon|Hera]]. The Colonial administration decides it is too dangerous to let a hybrid child be raised by a Cylon mother, so they fake the child's death and rehome her with a human mother. Despite the strain this puts on Sharon's loyalty, she continues to help the ''Galactica''.

==== Post-occupation of New Caprica ====

Sharon and Helo are married in the year-long gap in events between Season 2 and Season 3, and, having earned the full trust of Admiral Adama, Sharon is sworn in as an officer in the Colonial Fleet at Boomer's rank of Lieutenant JG. She is sent back to New Caprica as the liaison between the ''Galactica'' fleet and the resistance effort, and, due to the inability of the Centurions to recognize individuals within the humanoid Cylon models, is able to infiltrate the Cylon base and steal the keys for the civilian ships. After the successful rescue mission, Sharon receives a new call sign: [[Athena]].

During Colonial negotiations with the Cylons, Athena and Helo learn their daughter is still alive on a Cylon ship. Athena travels to the ship and retrieves her daughter, prompting a conflict with Boomer that results in Boomer being killed again.

====Visions of daughter Hera====
Sharon discovers that she, Hera, President Roslin, and Caprica Six are all sharing the same recurring vision in which they are chasing Hera, who is running away into the arms of a Number Six individual. The vision prompts Athena to kill an ambassador Number Six, [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Natalie Faust|Natalie]], out of fear, nearly causing a diplomatic incident.

Hera becomes "[[Mitochondrial Eve]]", meaning that all modern-day humans are descended from Athena.

===Other Number Eight versions===
* One of a group of [[Number Two (Battlestar Galactica)|Two]]s, [[Number Five (Battlestar Galactica)|Five]]s, and [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Six]]es at Ragnar Anchorage after the fleet strands "Aaron Doral"
* One wearing a white coat at the Spaceport at Delphi, whom Athena kills before the other Eight can shoot Helo
** One can assume that the Number Eight in the audience watching [[D'Anna Biers]]'s documentary is same one Athena shot, due to the visual cue of the same white coat
* Multiple naked copies aboard the Kobol-orbiting basestar that Boomer was sent to destroy
* Copies who act as "midwives" in the respective resurrections of Caprica Six and Boomer
* Several copies on Cylon-occupied Caprica going through daily life in the episode "[[Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)|Downloaded]]"
* Copies killed when [[Samuel Anders]] and [[Galen Tyrol]] detonate a bomb near a Cylon Heavy Raider
* A copy sitting next to Boomer in a meeting on Colonial One (during the New Caprican occupation), when the suicide bombings are discussed.
* Several on the basestar where Caprica Six and Baltar reside

* Several help repair Galactica in "[[Someone to Watch Over Me (Battlestar Galactica)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]"
** One is knocked unconscious by [[Galen Tyrol|Tyrol]]  and used as a body double for Boomer in the brig
** Another is mortally injured in "[[Islanded in a Stream of Stars]]" and expresses thanks to a visiting [[Saul Tigh]] in the sickbay for the opportunity to meet her "father" (referencing his status as one of the [[Cylon (reimagining)#The "Final Five" Humanoid Cylons (Samuel Anders, Galen Tyrol, Tory Foster, Saul Tigh, Ellen Tigh)|Final Five]]) 
** Another is prominent at the bedside of the comatose [[Samuel Anders]] in "[[Deadlock]]", "Someone to Watch Over Me" and "Islanded in a Stream of Stars," and offers key suggestions for his recovery

==Typical Eight traits==
The Eights are known for their concern for others, naivete, emotional immaturity, and vulnerability to forming emotional attachments. They also have a propensity for fickleness and change loyalties to better suit their own desires, with the notable exception of Athena. [[Ronald D. Moore|Director Ron Moore]] has commented that the Eights are more likely to "shoot things they don't like," and early in the series, they are implied to be the most militaristic of the models and the most likely to have combat training.

Unlike some other Cylon models, the individual Eights do not automatically have access to each other's memories and consciousnesses, which gives them a stronger ability to form distinct identities.

''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'' showrunner [[Kevin Murphy (screenwriter)|Kevin Murphy]] said that, had the prequel series ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'' continued, it would have revealed that the Eights' default personality was modelled after that of Tamara Adama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capricatimes.com/the-caprica-times-exclusive-interview-kevin-murphy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323190011/http://www.capricatimes.com/the-caprica-times-exclusive-interview-kevin-murphy |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Call sign origins==

The [[Aviator call sign|call signs]] for both Sharons hail back to the original ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' series. [[Lieutenant Boomer|Boomer]] was the name (not the call sign) of a Viper pilot character played by [[Herbert Jefferson, Jr.]], while Athena was the name of [[Lieutenant Athena|Commander Adama's daughter]].

An ethical and decision-making principle, the '''proactionary principle''' is formulated by the [[transhumanist]] philosopher [[Max More]] as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extropy.org/proactionaryprinciple.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;People’s freedom to innovate technologically is highly valuable, even critical, to humanity. This implies several imperatives when restrictive measures are proposed: Assess risks and opportunities according to available science, not popular perception. Account for both the costs of the restrictions themselves, and those of opportunities foregone. Favor measures that are proportionate to the probability and magnitude of impacts, and that have a high expectation value. Protect people’s freedom to experiment, innovate, and progress.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The proactionary principle was formulated as an opposing viewpoint to the [[precautionary principle]], which is based on the concept that consequences of actions in complex systems are often unpredictable and irreversible and concludes that such actions should generally be opposed. The Proactionary Principle is based upon the observation that historically, the most useful and important technological innovations were neither obvious nor well understood at the time of their invention. More recommends 10 principles in his paper "Proactionary Principle":

#Freedom to innovate
#Objectivity
#Comprehensiveness
#Openness/Transparency
#Simplicity
#Triage
#Symmetrical treatment
#Proportionality
#Prioritization
#Renew and Refresh

In a syndicated newspaper article that has been translated into eight languages, [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steve Fuller]] has argued that the precautionary principle and the proactionary principle are likely to replace the right-left divide in politics in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-future-of-ideological-conflict |title=The Future of Ideological Conflict |first=Steve |last=Fuller |publisher=Project Syndicate |date=2012-05-07 |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent book, ''The Proactionary Imperative'' by Fuller and Lipinska attempts to make the proactionary principle fundamental to [[transhumanism]] as a world-view, stressing the principle's interpretation of risk as an opportunity rather than a threat.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Fuller, Veronika Lipinska, ''The Proactionary Imperative: A Foundation for Transhumanism'', Palgrave Macmillan 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, sufficient study of the variables of any proposed course of action may yield acceptable levels of predictability. In this regard the proactionary principle can be looked upon as the philosophical formulation of the accepted mathematical principles of ''[[extrapolation]]'' and the logical principles of ''[[inductive reasoning|induction]]''.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

However, the proactionary principle argues that "sufficient study" may in some cases be impractical.  For instance, in releasing a new life form into the biosphere &amp;mdash; whether genetically modified plant, animal, or bacteria &amp;mdash; one would have to simulate the biosphere to achieve "acceptable levels of predictability". While the innovator of the new life form might point out that such a simulation would be a heavy burden, the other life forms in the biosphere could suffer irreparable harm in the case of an untested release. More's first principle, freedom to innovate, would place the burden of proof on those who propose a restrictive measure.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

According to the proactionary principle (and [[cost-benefit analysis]]), the opportunity cost of imposing a restrictive measure must be balanced against the potential costs of damage due to a new technology, rather than just considering the potential damages alone.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

The '''massacre at the [[Qissa Khwani Bazaar]]''' ({{lang-ps|د قصه خوانۍ بازار خونړۍ پېښه}}) in [[Peshawar]], [[British India]] (modern day [[Pakistan]]) on 23 April 1930 was one of the defining moments of the independence movement in British India. It was the first major confrontation between British troops and demonstrators in the city. Estimates at the time put the death toll from the shooting at between the official count at 20, and the figure of 400 dead put forth by Pakistani and Indian sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/299566 |title=Peshawar: Qissa Khwani martyrs remembered |date=24 April 2008 |publisher=Dawn.com |accessdate=24 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410201709/https://www.dawn.com/news/299566 |archivedate=10 April 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gunning down of unarmed people triggered protests across British India and catapulted the newly formed ''[[Khudai Khidmatgar]]'' movement into prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Qissa Khwani's tale of tear and blood  |first=Kazi |last=Sarwar |date=20 April 2002 |url=http://www.statesman.com.pk |publisher=Statesman.com.pk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The ''Khudai Khidmatgar'' (literally ''Servants of God''), led by [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]], were a group of Muslims committed to the removal of British rule through non-violent methods. On 23 April 1930, Ghaffar Khan was arrested after giving a speech in Utmanzai urging resistance to British rule. Ghaffar Khan's reputation for uncompromising integrity and commitment to non-violence inspired most of the local townspeople to take the oath of membership and join the ''Khudai Khidmatgar'' in protest.&lt;ref name="johansen"&gt;Johansen, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneous demonstrations were led by a cross section of civil society in and around Peshawar, led by Maulana Abdur Rahim Popalzai against discriminatory laws like the [[Frontier Crimes Regulation]] against the people of the province.

==Clashes at the Qissa Khwani bazaar== 
After other ''Khudai Khidmatgar'' leaders were arrested, a large crowd of the group gathered at the Qissa Khwani bazaar. As British Indian troops moved into the bazaar, the crowd was loud and stones were thrown. A British Army dispatch rider was killed and his body burned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nam.ac.uk/online-collection/detail.php?acc=1977-02-39-2&lt;/ref&gt; Two British armored cars drove into the square at high speed, killing several people. It is claimed that the crowd continued their commitment to non-violence, offering to disperse if they could gather their dead and injured, and if British troops left the square. The British troops refused to leave, so the protesters remained with the dead and injured.&lt;ref name=johansen/&gt; At that point, the British ordered troops to open fire with machine guns on the unarmed crowd.&lt;ref name="habib"&gt;"Civil Disobedience 1930-31". Social Scientist (September – October 1997) (Social Scientist, Vol. 25, No. 9/10) 25 (9–10): pp. 43–66. {{doi|10.2307/3517680}}. Retrieved 2007-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt; The Khudai Khidmatgar members willingly faced bullets, responding without violence. Instead, many members repeated 'God is Great'(अल्लाहु अकबर) and clutched the [[Qur'an]] as they went to their death.&lt;ref name=johansen/&gt;

[[Image:Qissakhwanibazaarmassacre.jpg|thumb|left|British Indian Army soldiers in Peshawar during the demonstrations]]
The exact number of deaths remains controversial&amp;mdash; official figures give 20 dead&lt;ref&gt;The Times 28 April 1930&lt;/ref&gt; while nationalist sources claimed several hundred were killed, with many more wounded. Two platoons of a respected British Indian Army regiment, the [[The Garhwal Rifles|Royal Garhwal Rifles]], refused to board buses that were to take them into Peshawar for anti-riot duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Philip|last=Mason|pages=451–452|title=A Matter of Honour|isbn=978-0-333-41837-6|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; A British civil servant wrote later that "hardly any regiment of the Indian Army won greater glory in the Great War (World War I) than the Garhwal Rifles, and the defection of part of the regiment sent shock waves through India, of apprehension to some, of exultation to others."&lt;ref name=johansen/&gt; The NCOs of the two platoons involved were sentenced to terms of up to eight years imprisonment.&lt;ref name=habib/&gt;

The violence continued for six hours. [[Gene Sharp]], who has written a study of [[nonviolent resistance]], describes the scene on that day:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When those in front fell down wounded by the shots, those behind came forward with their chests bared and exposed themselves to the fire, so much so that some people got as many as twenty-one bullet wounds in their bodies, and all the people stood their ground without getting into a panic. . . . The [[Anglo-Indian]] paper of [[Lahore]], which represents the official view, itself wrote to the effect that the people came forward one after another to face the firing and when they fell wounded they were dragged back and others came forward to be shot at. This state of things continued from 11 till 5 o'clock in the evening. When the number of corpses became too many, the ambulance cars of the government took them away.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftermath==
In Peshawar and the surrounding area, the ''Khudai Khidmatgar'' suffered some of the most extreme suffering of the [[Indian independence movement]]. Ghaffar Khan later wrote that this was because the British thought a non-violent Pashtun was more dangerous than a violent one. Because of this, the British did everything they could to provoke them into violence, with little effect.&lt;ref name=johansen/&gt;

The British action against the local Indian population created unrest. This resulted in [[King George VI]] (Emperor of India) launching a legal investigation into this matter. The British Commission brought the case forward to Chief Justice Naimatullah Chaudhry, a distinguished Judge of the Lucknow protectorate.

King George VI subsequently knighted Naimatullah Chaudhry. Naimatullah personally surveyed the area of [[massacre]] and published a 200-page report criticizing the British actions. 

Olaf Caroe, then secretary to the Chief Commissioner, gave the following report of the event (‘Public and Judicial Department. Civil Disobedience Campaign in NWFP. Response to Patel allegations’. British Library reference number L/PJ/6/2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shamsie|first1=Kamila|title=A God in Every Stone|date=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=978-1408847206}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
″I received a note on 23rd April evening from Sir Norman Bolton asking me to do what I could to arrange for the burial of as many of the casualties as possible during the night, in order to avoid the danger of a fresh riot occurring over the funeral procession. I spoke to R.S. Mehr Chand Khanna and asked him to bring me some of the leading Khilafists at the Municipal Library. He brought M. Abdurrab Nishtar; M. Ataullah Jan, Municipal Commissioner; M. Aurangzeb Khan, Vakil; Qazi Mohd Aslam, Vakil.

I informed these persons what was required and asked for their co-operation as peace-loving citizens and good Muslims. They agreed to do what they could and asked me to arrange for lorries, saying they would persuade the relatives to agree. I arranged for lorries through Shahji – one of C.C.’s orderlies – who is I believe a Peshawari and a Syed. During the night in this way we sent away seven or eight bodies in lorries. Some of them had no relatives and arrangements were made to pay for a mullah and to carry through the obsequies with all regard to religious rites. The next day Qazi Mohd Aslam came to see me and said that he was making himself unpopular by assisting in the matter. He gave me to understand that he could do no more. I fancy that the association of these four men with the action taken will put an end to any attempt to make capital of the incident.″

'''Robert Budd Dwyer''' (November 21, 1939&amp;nbsp;– January 22, 1987) was the 30th [[Pennsylvania Treasurer|State Treasurer]] of the Commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]]. He served from 1971 to 1981 as a Republican member of the [[Pennsylvania State Senate]] representing the state's [[Pennsylvania Senate, District 50|50th district]]. He then served as the 30th Treasurer of Pennsylvania from January 20, 1981, until his death. On January 22, 1987, Dwyer called a news conference in the Pennsylvania state capital of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] where he killed himself in front of the gathered reporters, by shooting himself in the mouth with a [[.357 Magnum]] revolver.&lt;ref name="nytimes.1987"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDF1638F930A15752C0A961948260|title=Official calls in press and kills himself|last=Stevens|first=William K.|date=January 23, 1987|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dwyer's [[suicide]] was broadcast later that day to a wide television audience across Pennsylvania.

In the early 1980s, Pennsylvania discovered its state workers had overpaid federal taxes due to errors in state withholding. Many accounting firms competed for a multimillion-dollar contract to determine compensation to each employee. In 1986, Dwyer was convicted of receiving a bribe from the California firm that ultimately won the contract. He was scheduled to be sentenced on those charges on January 23, 1987, the day after his suicide.

Throughout Dwyer's trial and after his conviction, he maintained that he was not guilty of the charges levied against him, and that he had been framed. Decades later, the prosecution's primary witness, [[William Trickett Smith]], whose testimony was largely used to obtain Dwyer's conviction, stated in the documentary ''[[Honest Man: The Life of R. Budd Dwyer]]'', as he did at Dwyer's trial, that he offered Dwyer a bribe and that Dwyer accepted the bribe. He expressed regret for the decision to offer Dwyer a bribe and for the role it played in Dwyer's death.&lt;ref name="honestman"&gt;{{Citation|last=EightyFourFilms|title=Honest Man: The Life of R.Budd Dwyer (Directors Cut)|date=2013-05-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPpqt00cb2E}}&lt;/ref&gt; James J. West, the former acting [[United States Attorney]] who prosecuted Dwyer, affirmed Dwyer's guilt in 2010.&lt;ref name="PennLive.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pennlive.com/editorials/index.ssf/2010/10/filmmaker_on_dwyer_guilty_as_c.html |title=Filmmaker on Dwyer: Guilty as charged? |publisher=PennLive, PA Media Group|date=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:R. Budd Dwyer family photograph.jpg|thumb|Dwyer with his family]]
Dwyer graduated from [[Allegheny College]] in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]], where he was a member of the Beta Chi chapter of [[Theta Chi|Theta Chi Fraternity]]. After earning a [[master's degree]] in education, he taught social studies and coached [[American football|football]] at [[Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania|Cambridge Springs High School]].

==Career==
[[File:R. Budd Dwyer with Gerald Ford.jpg|thumb|Dwyer in the 1970s, with U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]].]]
[[File:R. Budd Dwyer swearing in as Pennsylvanian state treasurer, 1984.jpg|thumb|Dwyer in 1984, being sworn in for his second term as Pennsylvania state treasurer.]]
A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Dwyer became active in politics. He was elected to the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] from the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives, District 6|6th]] district (although seats were apportioned by county prior to 1969) in 1964 and was reelected in 1966 and 1968. In 1970, while still a sitting State Representative, Dwyer ran for a seat in the [[Pennsylvania State Senate]] from its 50th district and won. Shortly after his victory he resigned his seat in the State House and was sworn in as Senator in January 1971.

After being elected to additional terms in 1974 and 1978, Dwyer decided to try for a state office and in 1980 ran for and won the office of [[Pennsylvania Treasurer]] that had been held by Robert E. Casey since 1976. He ran for a second and last term in 1984 and won reelection to the seat.

===Bribery investigation and conviction===
During the early 1980s, public employees of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania overpaid millions of dollars in [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|Federal Insurance Contributions Act]] (FICA) taxes. As a result, the state solicited bids from accounting firms to determine refunds for its employees. The contract was eventually awarded to Computer Technology Associates (CTA), a [[California]]-based firm, owned by John Torquato, Jr, a native of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Later Pennsylvania Governor [[Dick Thornburgh]] received an anonymous memo detailing allegations of bribery that took place during the bidding process for the $4.6 million contract.

An investigation was undertaken by [[United States Department of Justice|federal]] [[United States Attorney|prosecutors]]. Dwyer was charged with agreeing to receive [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] worth $300,000 in return for using his office to steer the contract toward CTA. The US Attorney also indicted Torquato, Torquato's attorney William T. Smith, Smith's wife, and [[Bob Asher]], the former Republican Party Chairman for the State of Pennsylvania. In return for lighter sentences, Torquato and the Smiths pleaded guilty and testified on behalf of the federal government against Dwyer and Asher.

It was revealed at Dwyer's trial that Dwyer sought and won approval for special legislation that authorized him to recover the FICA overpayments, and that coded computer tape seized from CTA's office in July 1984 showed that Dwyer was to receive a $300,000 pay-off for awarding CTA the contract.&lt;ref&gt;"Jury hears closing arguments in CTA Bribery Conspiracy Trial" Observer-Reporter&amp;nbsp;— Dec 13, 1986. https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_XBeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=q2ENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1077%2C1989816&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Smith and Torquato's claims about Dwyer being bribed were corroborated by four independent and impartial witnesses,&lt;ref&gt;"CTA Case heads to Jury" The Pittsburgh Press&amp;nbsp;— Dec 13, 1986. https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=99QbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KmMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6193%2C2280060&lt;/ref&gt; and Smith's testimony against Dwyer was virtually identical to written statements Smith made long before entering into a plea agreement.&lt;ref&gt;"CTA defence throws doubt on witnesses" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&amp;nbsp;— Dec 13, 1986, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BYBIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5W0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3388%2C5382972&lt;/ref&gt; Dwyer maintained that he awarded CTA the contract on the basis of his task force recommendation, yet this conflicted with the fact that Dwyer himself personally handled all matters relating to the contract six days prior to awarding it to CTA.&lt;ref name="dropbox.com"&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/s/v8p2mz0824pe5gi/Dwyer_Indictment.pdf?dl=0&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Dwyer awarded the contract to CTA — an obscure Californian firm with few employees and little equipment — despite being informed by the major Pennsylvania-based accounting firm Arthur Young and Associates that they could perform the FICA recovery as fast as CTA for half the cost.&lt;ref name="dropbox.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v8pRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4G0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6108%2C196013&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Dwyer denied any wrongdoing. Dwyer's lawyer spoke to the prosecutor, acting U.S. Attorney West, asking him if he would drop all charges against Dwyer if Dwyer resigned as state treasurer. West declined the offer. He instead [[plea bargain|offered]] to let Dwyer plead guilty to a single charge of [[bribery|bribe receiving]], which would have meant up to a maximum of five years' imprisonment, as long as he resigned from his office as Treasurer of Pennsylvania and fully cooperated with the government's investigation, but Dwyer refused. Instead Dwyer went to trial. At his trial, Dwyer did not take the stand and his lawyer presented no defense witnesses.&lt;ref name="news.google.com"/&gt;  However his defense was curtailed by the prosecution because the case was limited to only those who had been charged. The names of the [[unindicted co-conspirator]]s who were linked in the bribery scandal but were not on trial were withheld. These unnamed individuals were believed to have been staff members of the [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin County]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dwyer Sought Presidential Pardon, Rejected Plea Bargaining|publisher=Associated Press|date=January 24, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 1986, Dwyer was found guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, perjury and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering, and consequently faced a sentence of up to 55 years imprisonment and a $300,000 fine.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DW9eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nGENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1346%2C2427748|title = Dwyer must resign or face dismissal, Zimmerman says|last = |first = |date = January 22, 1987|work = Observer-Reporter|access-date = November 8, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 700 Attend Services For Dwyer Treasurer Recalled As 'Righteous Man'|url = http://articles.philly.com/1987-01-27/news/26190720_1_plea-bargaining-memorial-service-funeral|website = philly-archives|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sentencing was scheduled for January 23, 1987, to be performed by U.S. District Court Judge [[Malcolm Muir (judge)|Malcolm Muir]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One mail-fraud charge against Dwyer was dismissed by Judge Muir.&lt;ref&gt;"Dwyer defense rests, One charge out in CTA trial" The Pittsburgh Press&amp;nbsp;— Dec 9, 1986, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=89QbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KmMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6324%2C42021&lt;/ref&gt; One juror, Carolyn Edwards of Williamsport, found it emotionally difficult to convict Dwyer (and Asher) since they were men of "very high integrity...they just made a mistake".&lt;ref&gt;"CTA Prove to Continue", The Pittsburgh Press&amp;nbsp;— Dec 19, 1986, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_yQeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G5YEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6441%2C1878698&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bob Asher]], Dwyer's co-defendant, was sentenced to one year in jail. He later returned to politics and served as a Republican national committeeman for Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="famouspictures" /&gt;

===Dwyer's status as state treasurer===
Pennsylvania law stated that Dwyer could not officially be removed from office until his sentencing in January. Given this, Dwyer stated that until his legal appeal was resolved, he would stay on as Treasurer under leave of absence without pay. In the interim, the treasury department would be run by Deputy Treasurer Donald L. Johnson.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Dwyer continued to profess his innocence after being convicted, as did others close to him.&lt;ref name="famouspictures"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famouspictures.org/mag/index.php?title=Budd_Dwyer|title=Famous Pictures Magazine&amp;nbsp;— Budd Dwyer|author=Lucas, Dean}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 23, he wrote a letter to President [[Ronald Reagan]] seeking a presidential pardon,&lt;ref name="dwyermovie"&gt;{{cite web|year=2010|url=http://dl.dropbox.com/u/33088283/Virb/DwyersLetterToReagan.pdf|title=Article Highlight: Budd's letter to Reagan.|format=''Honest Man'' (Film)|publisher=dwyermovie.com|accessdate=January 30, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004010706/http://dl.dropbox.com/u/33088283/Virb/DwyersLetterToReagan.pdf|archivedate=October 4, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Arlen Specter|Senator Arlen Specter]] seeking support in this effort.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

The week of Dwyer's sentencing, Pennsylvania State Attorney General Leroy Zimmerman and state prosecutors were investigating a provision of the Pennsylvania state constitution where removal of a civil worker from office who has been convicted of a crime is "self executing", thus, automatic upon that person's sentencing. A decision confirming this constitutional point was expected on January 22, the day before Dwyer's sentencing hearing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lgc.state.pa.us/getfile.cfm?file=/Reports/deskbook14/Issues-Governance08-Removal-from-Office.pdf|title = Removal From Office|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==January 22 press conference==
In a meeting in his home, Dwyer discussed the idea of a press conference with his press secretary James "Duke" Horshock and Deputy Treasurer Don Johnson, on January 15, 1987. At the time, Johnson cautioned Dwyer not to use such a forum to attack the governor or other individuals involved with his criminal conviction, and Dwyer assured him that he would not do so. Both men left assuming Dwyer would ultimately resign if the press conference were held.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rSQeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GpYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6259%2C3216975|title = He searched in vain for help: State treasurer spent last days seeking peace|last = |first = |date = January 23, 1987|work = The Pittsburgh Press|access-date = November 11, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dwyer finally reached Senator Specter by telephone on January 21, two days before his sentencing. A Specter aide stated that the two of them talked for 8-to-10 minutes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dwyer Sought Specter's Help To Get A Presidential Pardon|url = http://articles.mcall.com/1987-01-24/news/2566807_1_dwyer-specter-s-office-sen-arlen-specter|website = tribunedigital-mcall|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following up on his letter to the senator asking for help, he personally asked for a presidential pardon at that time. The senator's response was that this request was "not realistic" because the judicial process, including appeals, had not yet run its course.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dwyer Rejected Deal, Later Sought Pardon|url = http://articles.philly.com/1987-01-24/news/26186955_1_dwyer-specter-plea|website = philly-archives|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Treasurer may have saved pension for wife|url = http://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/01/23/Treasurer-may-have-saved-pension-for-wife/9732538376400/|website = UPI|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, Dwyer asked his press secretary Horshock and deputy press secretary Gregory Penny to set up a news conference for the next day without telling them what he was to discuss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Kaminski|first1 = Joseph|title = Case Study: R.

The press secretary called dozens of reporters asking them to attend, and told them he did not know its subject.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Initially, Dwyer wanted to ban from the press conference certain reporters who he believed wrote biased accounts about him, and even suggested that a guard should be in attendance to prevent entry to those who were not on his authorized list. Horshock, who was unconvinced about Dwyer's claims that he was being conspired against, objected, stating to Dwyer that he could not "use state government facilities to manipulate the free flow of information".&lt;ref&gt;The Bitter End of R. Budd Dwyer, The Pittsburgh Press&amp;nbsp;— Jan 21, 1990 https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=90MgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7ZYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4854%2C2153889&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading up to the press conference, acting U.S. Attorney West, who had secured the conviction against Dwyer, remarked that the Treasurer's resignation "sounds like the appropriate thing to do under the circumstances. It seems like it would save everybody a lot of time and aggravation."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similarly, Harrisburg ''[[Patriot-News]]'' reporter Kenn Marshall described the consensus among reporters: they would be attending to see Dwyer announce his resignation from office. "My mission was to stay there until he said those words, then call in a new top for our story."&lt;ref name="PennLiveNewFilm"&gt;{{cite news|author=Dunkle, David N.|title=Former Pennsylvania Treasurer R. Budd Dwyer's controversial death re-examined in new film|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2010/11/former_pennsylvania_treasurer.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xrEvFmeP?url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2010/11/former_pennsylvania_treasurer.html|archivedate=2011-04-11|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What nobody knew at the time was that Dwyer was considering a much more drastic action. The night before the press conference, Dwyer wrote the following note:

{{quote|I enjoy being with Jo so much, the next 20 years or so would have been wonderful. Tomorrow is going to be so difficult and I hope I can go through with it.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://dwyermovie.com/|title = Honest Man: The Life of R.Budd Dwyer (documentary movie)|date = 2010|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Eighty Four Films|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Dwyer's press statement===
The next morning, Dwyer went to his press conference as planned. Appearing nervous and agitated, he again professed his innocence and began reading from a 21-page prepared text later described as a "rambling polemic about the criminal justice system".&lt;ref name="PennLiveNewFilm" /&gt; It singled out former Governor Thornburgh, Acting U.S. Attorney West, agents in the FBI, Judge Muir, and others for tarnishing the justice system and ruining him.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Dwyer spoke out against the death penalty and expressed regret for voting in favor of it while he was in the Pennsylvania assembly. This speech lasted nearly 30 minutes, and approximately halfway into it, with no apparent end in sight, some of the gathered press began to pack up and leave. Dwyer spotted this and interrupted himself to say, "Those of you who are putting your cameras away, I think you ought to stay because we're not, we're not finished yet."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Given the inflammatory nature of portions of Dwyer's text, press secretary Horshock had considered interrupting him outright to stop him, but concluded that he would hold his own press conference after Dwyer's. "I had to make it known that I was not aware of the content of the statement. I didn't want it to be thought that I wrote that for him."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Upon reaching the final page of his statement, which had not been distributed to the press nor press secretary Horshock in advance, Dwyer paused. "...and I'm on the last page now, and I don't have enough to pass out, but Duke [Horshock], I'll leave this here, and you can make copies for the people; there's a few extra copies here right now."&lt;ref name="FinalWords"&gt;Video containing audio of final words ([http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6686827830708949101 link])&lt;/ref&gt; Dwyer continued,

{{quote|I thank the good Lord for giving me 47 years of exciting challenges, stimulating experiences, many happy occasions and most of all[,] the finest wife and children any man could ever desire.

Now my life has changed for no apparent reason. People who call and write are exasperated and feel helpless. They know I am innocent and want to help, but in this nation, the worlds [''sic''] greatest democracy, there is nothing they can do to prevent me from being punished for a crime they know I did not commit. Some who have called have said that I am a modern day [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]].

Judge Muir is also noted for his medieval sentences. I face a maximum sentence of 55 years in prison and a $305,000 fine for being innocent. Judge Muir has already told the press that he felt "invigorated" when we were found guilty and that he plans to imprison me as a "deterrant" to other public officials. But it wouldn't be a deterrant [''sic''] because every public official who knows me knows that I am innocent. It wouldn't be legitimate punishment because I've done nothing wrong. Since I'm a victim of political persecution, my prison would simply be an American [[Gulag]].

I ask those that believe in me to continue to extend friendship and prayer to my family, to work untiringly for the creation of a true justice system here in the United States, and to press on with the efforts to vindicate me, so that my family and their future families are not tainted by this injustice that has been perpetrated on me.

We were confident that right and truth would prevail and I would be acquitted and we would devote the rest of our lives working to create a justice system here in the United States. The guilty verdict has strengthened that resolve. But as we've discussed our plans to expose the warts of our legal system[,] people have said, 'Why bother? No one cares, you'll look foolish, ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'', the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]], and others have been publicizing cases like yours for years and it doesn't bother anyone.'}}

At this point Dwyer stopped reading from his prepared remarks, with the gathered press still waiting on his expected resignation. There was still a significant portion remaining, which detailed what he was actually planning to do, and it read as follows:

{{quote|I've repeatedly said that I'm not going to resign as State Treasurer. After many hours of thought and meditation I've made a decision that should not be an example to anyone because it is unique to my situation. Last May I told you that after the trial, I would give you the story of the decade. To those of you who are shallow, the events of this morning will be that story. But to those of you with depth and concern the real story will be what I hope and pray results from this morning–in the coming months and years[,] the development of a true justice system here in the United States. I am going to die in office in an effort to '...see if the shame[-ful] facts, spread out in all their shame, will not burn through our civic shamelessness and set fire to American pride.' Please tell my story on every radio and television station and in every newspaper and magazine in the U.S.. Please leave immediately if you have a weak stomach or mind since I don't want to cause physical or mental distress. Joanne, Rob, DeeDEe [''sic''] - I love you! Thank you for making my life so happy. Good bye to you all on the count of 3. Please make sure that the sacrifice of my life is not in vain.}}

After deciding to break from his speech, Dwyer called to three of his staffers, giving each a sealed envelope with the insignia of the treasury department.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The first envelope, given to [[Bob Holste]], contained a letter addressed to then-Pennsylvania Governor [[Robert P. Casey|Bob Casey]], who had taken office just two days earlier. The second, given to deputy press secretary Gregory Penny, contained an [[organ donation|organ donor]] card and other related materials. The last, given to Deputy Treasurer Don Johnson, contained materials intended for Dwyer's family, including three letters (one for his wife Joanne, and one for each of his children, Rob and DeeDee) and suggested funeral arrangements.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LIveLeaks"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=cd0_1296909173|title=Robert Dwyer shoots himself in the mouth|last=|first=|date=January 22, 1987|work=|publisher=[[LiveLeak]]|access-date=|via=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freelance photographer Gary Miller, one of the reporters in attendance, describes the scene to this point, "It was just kind of a long-winded, sad event."&lt;ref name="PennLiveNewFilm" /&gt;

===Public suicide===

After he had finished speaking and handing out the notes to his staffers, Dwyer then produced a [[manila paper|manila envelope]] with a [[Bluing (steel)|blued]] [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 27]] [[.357 Magnum]] revolver in it. When the crowd in the room saw what Dwyer had pulled out of the envelope, the mood changed immediately from one of waiting to see whether he would resign his office to one of panic as nobody else but Dwyer knew what he was planning to do with the gun. People gasped and Dwyer backed up against the wall, pointing the weapon into the air. Dwyer calmly stated to his audience, "Please, please leave the room if this will...if this will affect you."&lt;ref name="newsday.1988"&gt;{{cite news|title=Witnesses to Tragedy|first=Laura|last=Muha|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/103854256.html?dids=103854256:103854256&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+21%2C+1988&amp;author=By+Laura+Muha&amp;pub=Newsday+%28Combined+editions%29&amp;desc=THE+PRESS+Witnesses+to+Tragedy+The+suicide+of+Pennsylvania+Treasurer+R.+Budd+Dwyer+a+year+ago+stirred+horror+and+introspection+in+the+reporters+who+saw+it&amp;pqatl=google|format=Newspaper archive|newspaper=Newsday|location=Long Island|date=January 21, 1988|page=3|quote=When he saw Dwyer's gun, he dashed from the room calling for help}} Text Word Count: 1290&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people in the room left to call for help. Among those who stayed, some pleaded with Dwyer to surrender the gun while others tried to approach him and seize the weapon. Dwyer warned against either action, exclaiming, "Don't, don't, don't, this will hurt someone."&lt;ref name="AP1-23"&gt;"PA. Treasurer Kills Self at News Conference", ''Associated Press'', January 23, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; A moment later, Dwyer fired one shot into his mouth and collapsed to the floor, dead.&lt;ref name="Grossman p. 108"&gt;{{harvnb|Grossman|2003|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five news cameras recorded the events. One of the cameras remained focused on Dwyer and captured close up footage of the aftermath of the shooting; as his body slumped to the floor, blood streamed from the exit wound in the back of his head as well as from his nostrils and mouth.&lt;ref name=docuslide&gt;{{cite news|url=http://documentslide.com/download/link/media-ethics-and-the-fourth-commandment-the-case-of-robert-budd-dwyer-pennsylvania|title=The Case of Robert Budd Dwyer, Pennsylvania State Treasurer|last=|first=|date=January 1, 2015|work=|publisher=www.documentslide.com|access-date=|quote=The bullet exited out of the top of his head, leaving a bloody stream ...as more blood flowed through his nostrils and from the exit wound.|via=|accessdate=December 3, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220224926/http://documentslide.com/download/link/media-ethics-and-the-fourth-commandment-the-case-of-robert-budd-dwyer-pennsylvania|archivedate=December 20, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horshock took the podium and asked the media to leave and for someone to call for medical assistance and the police.

Robert Budd Dwyer died instantly from the gunshot shortly before 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. EST, but was not pronounced dead at the scene until 11:31&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name="AP1-23" /&gt; An aide later stated that Dwyer's corneas were made available for transplant per his organ donation wishes, but that no other organs were usable by the time his body reached a hospital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Graphic footage and television media===
A number of television stations throughout Pennsylvania broadcast taped footage of Dwyer's suicide to a midday audience. Philadelphia station [[WPVI-TV|WPVI]] (Channel 6) showed Dwyer pulling the trigger and falling backwards, but did not show the bullet path.&lt;ref&gt;Bianculli, David and Shister, Gail. "How TV Covered The Dwyer Suicide", ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', Philadelphia, 23 January 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several hours, news editors had to decide how much of the graphic footage to air.&lt;ref name="scoundrels2"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=wMordht2OpQC&amp;pg=PT22 | title=Scoundrels | publisher=eBookIt.com | author=Firth, Robert | year=2011 | pages=205 | isbn=1456604163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many stations, including [[WCAU-TV|WCAU]] and Pennsylvania's [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] stations [[KYW-TV|KYW]] and [[KDKA-TV|KDKA]], froze the action just prior to the gunshot. However, the latter two allowed the audio of the shooting to continue under the frozen image. Group W's news cameraman William L. "Bill" Martin and reporter David Sollenberger had a camera set up at the conference. They chose to air the audio with a freeze frame of the gun in Dwyer's mouth. Only a handful aired the unedited press conference. [[WPVI-TV|WPVI]] in [[Philadelphia]] re-broadcast the suicide footage in full on their 5&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 6&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Action News]] broadcast without a warning to viewers. That station's broadcast is a source for copies circulating on the Internet. [[WPXI-TV|WPXI]] in [[Pittsburgh]] is reported by the [[Associated Press]] to have broadcast the footage uncensored on an early newscast. In explaining the decision to air, WPXI operations manager By Williams said, "It's an important event [about] an important man." Williams avoided airing the footage in the evening newscasts, explaining, "Everyone knows by then that he did it. There are children out of school."&lt;ref name="APNYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Pictures Raise News Issue|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D71138F930A15752C0A961948260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1987-01-23|accessdate=2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in central Pennsylvania, many children were home from school during the day of Dwyer's suicide due to a snowstorm, and Harrisburg TV station [[WHTM-TV]] opted to broadcast uncut video of the suicide twice that day, defending the decision (despite hundreds of viewer complaints afterward) due to the important nature of the story.

Many older students reacted to the event by creating [[black comedy]] jokes similar to those that circulated after the ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|disaster]]. A study of the incidence of the jokes showed that they were told only in areas where stations showed uncensored footage of the press conference.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Bronner]], "Political Suicide: The Budd Dwyer Joke Cycle and the Humor of Disaster." ''Midwestern Folklore'' 14 (1988): 81-89.&lt;/ref&gt; At least one reporter present at Dwyer's suicide suffered from being a witness. [[Tony Romeo (reporter)|Tony Romeo]], a radio reporter, was standing a few feet from Dwyer. After the suicide, Romeo developed [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and took a break from journalism.&lt;ref name="AJR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=413|title=Feeling the Heat|last=Soteropoulos|first=Jacqueline|date=December 2000|work=[[American Journalism Review]]|accessdate=2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letter to Governor Bob Casey===
Dwyer's deep mistrust of outgoing Republican Governor Thornburgh was spelled out in detail in his press conference statement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://dl.dropbox.com/u/33088283/Virb/Dwyer_Final_Statements.pdf|title = Dwyer, Final Statements, Press Conference, Pennsylvania Treasurer's Office|date = January 22, 1987|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Dwyer|first = R. Budd}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The timing of Dwyer's press conference and suicide meant that Thornburgh was not empowered to appoint a Treasurer to replace him. Instead, this fell to Thornburgh's successor, Democrat Bob Casey, who had taken office on January 20, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Casey Vows Political Open Door 5,000 View Inaugural Ceremony|url = http://articles.philly.com/1987-01-21/news/26191261_1_robert-p-casey-ceremonies-new-governor|website = philly-archives|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter Dwyer had sent to Casey stated, among other things, "By the time you receive this letter...the office of State Treasurer of Pennsylvania will be vacant. I stress to you that I did not resign but was State Treasurer of Pennsylvania to the end." It also stated that Casey "will be the great Governor that Pennsylvania needs at this time in our history." He suggested his wife Joanne as the successor to Treasurer of Pennsylvania, describing her as "very talented, personable, organized and hard-working."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = OFFICIAL CALLS IN PRESS AND KILLS HIMSELF|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/23/us/official-calls-in-press-and-kills-himself.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1987-01-23|access-date = 2015-11-08|issn = 0362-4331|first = William K. Stevens, Special To The New York|last = Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor Casey did not take Dwyer's suggestion. Regardless of the events of January 22, the governor and legislature of Pennsylvania already expected Dwyer to either resign or be removed from office. As such, a deal had already been brokered wherein the next treasurer, a Democrat, would serve out Dwyer's term and step down at its end. This was [[G. Davis Greene Jr.]], who was appointed as the 31st Treasurer of Pennsylvania on January 23, 1987, the day after Dwyer's suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = G. Davis Greene Jr., 81, former state treasurer|url = http://articles.philly.com/2012-09-06/news/33617725_1_financial-adviser-state-treasurer-bob-casey|website = philly-archives|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to allegations made by Dwyer in his final press statement===
Following Dwyer's public suicide, the [[National Association of State Treasurers]] called for Dwyer's allegations (contained in his final press statement) to be reviewed by the [[United States Department of Justice]]. After a thorough investigation, the Justice Department's [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] cleared attorney James West, and everyone else involved in Dwyer's investigation and prosecution, of any wrongdoing. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] also investigated Dwyer's claims regarding impropriety on behalf of FBI personnel. They ultimately found Dwyer's claims to be lacking "in substance and specificity" and warranting "no further action".&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/BuddDwyer&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death benefits===
Since Dwyer died in office, his widow Joanne was able to collect full survivor benefits totaling over $1.28 million, which at the time was the largest death benefit payment ever made by the state system. If Dwyer had been sentenced, state law would have prohibited the payment of his state-provided pension benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Associated Press |date=April 16, 1987 |title=Family to Get $1.28-Million Pension in Suicide of Pennsylvania Official |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-16/news/mn-751_1_pension-benefit |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=April 19, 2017 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025022622/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-16/news/mn-751_1_pension-benefit |archive-date=October 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for Dwyer suggested that he may have killed himself to preserve the pension benefits for his family, whose finances had been ruined by legal defense costs.&lt;ref&gt;"Pennsylvania Official's Suicide May Be Linked to Finances", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', January 24, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Other statements made by friends and family also suggest that this was Dwyer's motivation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

{{rape}}

'''Rape''' is a type of [[sexual assault]] usually involving [[sexual intercourse]] or other forms of [[sexual penetration]] carried out against a person without that person's [[consent]]. The act may be carried out by physical force, [[coercion]], [[Abusive power and control|abuse of authority]], or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an [[intellectual disability]] or is below the legal [[age of consent]].&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexual violence chapter 6 |publisher=''[[World Health Organization]]'' |date=2002 |access-date=5 December 2015 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2002/9241545615_chap6_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rape |publisher=dictionary.reference.com |date=April 15, 2011 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rape}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rape |publisher=legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date=April 15, 2011 |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/rape}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''rape'' is sometimes used interchangeably with the term ''sexual assault.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Petrak |editor1-first=Jenny |editor2-last=Hedge |editor2-first=Barbara |title=The Trauma of Sexual Assault Treatment, Prevention and Practice. |year=2003 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Chichester |isbn=978-0-470-85138-8 |page=2 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=6KZfQ6cSVHoC |page=2}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of reporting, prosecuting and convicting for rape varies between jurisdictions. Internationally, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 ranged, per 100,000 people, from 0.2 in [[Azerbaijan]] to 92.9 in [[Botswana]] with 6.3 in [[Lithuania]] as the [[median]].&lt;ref name="unodc1"&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Crime-statistics/Sexual_violence_sv_against_children_and_rape.xls "Rape at the National Level, number of police recorded offenses".] United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, rape is primarily committed by males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/ |title=Violence against women |website=World Health Organization |language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows, and [[Rape of males by males|male-on-male]] and [[Lesbian rape|female-on-female]] [[prison rape]]s are common and may be the least reported forms of rape.&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]][https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2001/prison/report7.html#_1_48 No Escape: Male Rape In U.S. Prisons.

Widespread and systematic rape (e.g., [[war rape]]) and [[sexual slavery]] can occur during international conflict. These practices are [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crime]]s. Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of [[genocide]] when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted ethnic group.

== Etymology ==

The term ''rape'' originates from the [[Latin language|Latin]] [[wikt:Special:Search/rapere|''rapere'']] (supine stem ''raptum''), "to snatch, to grab, to carry off".&lt;ref name = "cor"&gt;Corinne J. Saunders, ''Rape and Ravishment in the Literature of Medieval England'', Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2001, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Kei"&gt;Keith Burgess-Jackson, ''A Most Detestable Crime: New Philosophical Essays on Rape'', Oxford University Press, New York, 1999, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 14th century, the term has come to mean "to seize and take away by force".&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rape |publisher=''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' |date= |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rape%5B3%5D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman law, the carrying off of a woman by force, with or without intercourse, constituted "raptus".&lt;ref name = "Kei"/&gt; In [[Medieval English]] law the same term could refer to either kidnapping or rape in the modern sense of "sexual violation".&lt;ref name = "cor"/&gt; The original meaning of "carry off by force" is still found in some phrases, such as "rape and pillage", or in titles, such as the stories of the [[The Rape of the Sabine Women|Rape of the Sabine Women]] and [[Europa (mythology)|The Rape of Europa]] or the poem ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', which is about the theft of a lock of hair.

== Definitions ==
=== General ===
{{Main|Types of rape|Laws regarding rape}}
{{See also|Rape by gender}}
Rape is defined in most jurisdictions as [[sexual intercourse]], or other forms of [[sexual penetration]], committed by a perpetrator against a victim without their [[consent]].&lt;ref name="Book04"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=ed. by Merril D. |title=Encyclopedia of rape |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. [u.a.] |isbn=978-0-313-32687-5 |pages=169–170 |edition= 1st publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of rape is inconsistent between governmental health organizations, law enforcement, health providers, and legal professions.&lt;ref name="Maier2008" /&gt; It has varied historically and culturally.&lt;ref name="Book04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maier2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maier |first1=S. L. |title="I Have Heard Horrible Stories...": Rape Victim Advocates' Perceptions of the Revictimization of Rape Victims by the Police and Medical System |journal=Violence Against Women |volume=14 |issue=7 |year=2008 |pages=786–808 |issn=1077-8012 |doi=10.1177/1077801208320245|pmid=18559867 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, ''rape'' had no sexual connotation and is still used in other contexts in English. In [[Roman law]], it or ''raptus'' was classified as a form of ''crimen vis'', "crime of assault".&lt;ref&gt;[[Justinian]], ''Institutiones'' [http://www.constitution.org/sps/sps02_j1-4.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary on Roman Law'', pp. 667 (''raptus'') and 768 (''vis'') [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=iklePELtR6QC }}]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Raptus'' described the abduction of a woman against the will of the man under whose authority she lived, and sexual intercourse was not a necessary element. Other definitions of rape have changed over time.

Until 2012, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) considered rape a crime solely committed by men against women. In 2012, they changed their definition from "The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will" to "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or [[Oral sex|oral penetration]] by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." The previous definition, which had remained unchanged since 1927, was considered outdated and narrow. The updated definition includes recognizing any gender of victim and perpetrator and that rape with an object can be as traumatic as penile/vaginal rape. The bureau further describes instances when the victim is unable to give consent because of mental or physical incapacity. It recognizes that a victim can be incapacitated by drugs and alcohol and unable to give valid consent. The definition does not change federal or state criminal codes or impact charging and prosecution on the federal, state or local level; it rather means that rape will be more accurately reported nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/1801 |title=An Updated Definition of Rape (U.S. Dept of Justice, January 6, 2012) |publisher= |accessdate=30 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313021145/http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/1801 |archivedate=13 March 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/us/politics/federal-crime-statistics-to-expand-rape-definition.html|title=Federal Crime Statistics to Expand Rape Definition|journal=The New York Times|first=Charlie|last=Savage|date=14 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health organizations and agencies have also expanded rape beyond traditional definitions. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines rape as a form of [[sexual assault]],&lt;ref name="WHO2002"&gt;{{cite web |title=WORLD REPORT ON VIOLENCE AND HEALTH |publisher=World Health Organization |page=149 |date=2002 |access-date=5 December 2015 |editor1-last=Krug |editor1-first=Etienne G. |displayeditors=etal |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/42495/1/9241545615_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) includes rape in their definition of sexual assault; they term rape a form of [[sexual violence]]. The CDC lists other acts of coercive, non-consensual sexual activity that may or may not include rape, including [[drug-facilitated sexual assault]], acts in which a victim is made to penetrate a perpetrator or someone else, intoxication where the victim is unable to consent (due to incapacitation or being unconscious), non-physically forced penetration which occurs after a person is pressured verbally (by intimidation or misuse of authority to force to consent), or completed or attempted forced penetration of a victim via unwanted physical force (including using a weapon or threatening to use a weapon).&lt;ref name = cdcstats&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/sv_surveillance_definitionsl-2009-a.pdf |accessdate=6 June 2017 |date=2014 |publisher=National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=Sexual Violence Surveillance: Uniform Definitions and Recommended Data Elements, Version 2.0. |last1=Basile |first1=KC |last2=Smith |first2=SG |last3=Breiding |first3=MJ |last4=Black |first4=MC |last5=Mahendra |first5=RR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Markovchick2016&gt;{{cite book |last=Markovchick |first=Vincent |title=Emergency medicine secrets |publisher=Elsevier |location=Philadelphia, PA |year=2016 |isbn=9780323355162 |pages=516–520 |chapter=Sexual Assault}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries or jurisdictions differentiate between rape and sexual assault by defining rape as involving penile penetration of the vagina, or solely penetration involving the penis, while other types of non-consensual sexual activity are called sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kalbfleisch |first1=Pamela J. |last2=Cody |first2=Michael J. |title=Gender Power and Communication in Human Relationships |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2012 |pages= |accessdate=April 30, 2013 |isbn=978-1-136-48050-8 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=LyMo1RUJwj0C |page=218}} |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ken Plummer |title=Modern Homosexualities: Fragments of Lesbian and Gay Experiences |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2002 |pages=187–191 |accessdate=August 24, 2013 |isbn=978-1-134-92242-0 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=OSO3q4XEfz4C |page=189}} |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland, for example, emphasizes penile penetration, requiring that the sexual assault must have been committed by use of a penis to qualify as rape.&lt;ref name="legislation.gov.uk, rape"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 |publisher=legislation.gov.uk/[[UK Statute Law Database]] |year=2009 |accessdate=December 12, 2013 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2009/9/section/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News, rape"&gt;{{cite news |authors=Tom de Castella, Jon Kelly |title=Assange case: How is rape defined? |publisher=BBC News |date=August 22, 2012 |accessdate=December 12, 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19333439}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1998 [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] defines rape as "a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive".&lt;ref name="Book04" /&gt; In other cases, the term ''rape'' has been phased out of legal use in favor of terms such as ''sexual assault'' or ''criminal sexual conduct''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msu.edu/~sdclub/resources/criminal%20code.doc |title=Criminal code |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scope ===

Victims of rape or sexual assault come from a wide range of [[gender]]s, ages, [[sexual orientation]]s, ethnicitities, geographical locations, cultures and degrees of impairment or disability. Incidences of rape are classified into a number of categories, and they may describe the relationship of the perpetrator to the victim and the context of the sexual assault. These include [[date rape]], [[gang rape]], [[marital rape]], [[incest|incestual rape]], [[child sexual abuse]], [[prison rape]], [[acquaintance rape]], [[war rape]] and [[statutory rape]]. Forced sexual activity can be committed over a long period of time with little to no physical injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/rape |title=UCSB's SexInfo |publisher=Soc.ucsb.edu |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosdahl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosdahl |first=Caroline |title=Textbook of basic nursing |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-60547-772-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly2011" /&gt;

=== Consent ===

Lack of consent is key to the definition of rape.&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com" /&gt;  Consent is affirmative "informed approval, indicating a freely given agreement" to sexual activity.&lt;ref name="cdcstats" /&gt; It is not necessarily expressed verbally, and may instead be overtly implied from actions, but the absence of objection does not constitute consent.&lt;ref name="Gruber2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gruber |first=Aya |date=December 2016 |title=Consent Confusion |url=http://scholar.law.colorado.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&amp;context=articles |journal=Cardozo Law Review |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=415–458|access-date=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of consent may result from either forcible compulsion by the perpetrator or an inability to consent on the part of the victim (such as people who are asleep, intoxicated or otherwise mentally compromised).&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior53/001/2011/en/ Rape and sexual violence: Human rights law and standards in the International Criminal Court] . Amnesty International 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexual intercourse with a person below the [[age of consent]], i.e., the age at which legal competence is established, is referred to as statutory rape.&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com" /&gt;

[[Duress]] is the situation when the person is threatened by force or violence, and may result in the absence of an objection to sexual activity. This can lead to the presumption of consent.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org" /&gt; Duress may be actual or threatened force or violence against the victim or someone close to the victim. Even [[blackmail]] may constitute duress. [[Abuse of power]] may constitute duress. For instance, in the Philippines, a man commits rape if he engages in sexual intercourse with a woman ''"By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno8353.htm REPUBLIC ACT NO. 8353]. Philippine Law. Approved: September 30, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in its landmark 1998 judgment used a definition of rape which did not use the word 'consent': "a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person ''under circumstances which are coercive''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/English%5CAnnualReports%5Ca-54-315.pdf Fourth Annual Report of ICTR to the General Assembly (1999)] March 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Marital rape, or spousal rape, is non-consensual sex in which the perpetrator is the victim's spouse. It is a form of [[Sexual violence by intimate partners|partner rape]], [[domestic violence]], and sexual abuse. Once widely accepted or ignored by law, spousal rape is now denounced by international conventions and is increasingly criminalized. Still, in many countries, spousal rape either remains legal, or is illegal but widely tolerated and accepted as a husband's prerogative. In 2006, the UN Secretary-General's ''In-depth study on all forms of violence against women'' stated that (pg 113): "Marital rape may be prosecuted in at least 104 states. Of these, 32 have made marital rape a specific criminal offence, while the remaining 74 do not exempt marital rape from general rape provisions. Marital rape is not a prosecutable offense in at least 53 States. Four States criminalize marital rape only when the spouses are judicially separated. Four States are considering legislation that would allow marital rape to be prosecuted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/vaw/publications/English%20Study.pdf |title=VAW/for printer/1/14/0 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006, several other states have outlawed marital rape (for example [[Thailand]] in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6225872.stm |title=Asia-Pacific &amp;#124; Thailand passes marital rape bill |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-06-21 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In the US, the criminalization of marital rape started in the mid-1970s and in 1993 North Carolina became the last state to make marital rape illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&amp;dat=19930702&amp;id=_xYxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UOEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6288,228462 |title=The Daily Gazette&amp;nbsp;— Google News Archive Search |publisher= |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, it is not clear if marital rape may or may not be prosecuted under ordinary rape laws. In the absence of a spousal rape law, it may be possible to bring prosecution for acts of forced sexual intercourse inside marriage by prosecuting, through the use of other criminal offenses (such as assault based offenses), the acts of violence or criminal threat that were used to obtain submission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Search |url=http://www.aware.org.sg/rape/ |title=Rape &amp; Sexual Assault &amp;#124; AWARE Singapore |publisher=Aware.org.sg |accessdate=2014-02-12|date=2011-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consent may be complicated by law, language, context, culture and sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Kulick2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kulick |first1=Don |title=No |journal=Language &amp; Communication |volume=23 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=139–151 |issn=0271-5309 |doi=10.1016/S0271-5309(02)00043-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that men consistently perceive women's actions as more sexual than they intend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-rape/#MenRea|title=Mens rea|chapter=Feminist Perspectives on Rape|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, verbalized 'no' to sex may be interpreted as 'keep trying', or even 'yes' by offenders. Some may believe that when injuries are not visible, the woman must have consented. If a man solicits sex from another man, the pursuer may be regarded as virile.&lt;ref name="Kulick2003"/&gt;

== Motives ==
{{further|Causes of sexual violence}}
The WHO states that the principal factors that lead to the perpetration of sexual violence against women, including rape, are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=WHO | author-link = World Health Organization |title=Violence against women |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/ |website=who.int |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |date=23 November 2012 |accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* attitudes of [[male entitlement|male sexual entitlement]];
* weak legal sanctions for sexual violence.

No single facet explains the motivation for rape; the underlying motives of rapists can be multi-faceted. Several factors have been proposed: [[anger]],&lt;ref&gt;Oliva, Janet R.

Sexual aggression is often considered a masculine identity characteristic of manhood in some male groups and is significantly correlated to the desire to be held higher in esteem among male peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Petty GM, Dawson B |title=Sexual aggression in normal men: incidence, beliefs and personality characteristics |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |doi=10.1016/0191-8869(89)90109-8 |year=1989 |volume=10 |pages=355–362 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexually aggressive behavior among young men has been correlated with gang or group membership as well as having other delinquent peers.&lt;ref name="Ouimette PC 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ouimette PC, Riggs D |title=Testing a mediational model of sexually aggressive behavior in nonincarcerated perpetrators |journal=Violence and Victims |year=1998 |volume=13 |pages=117–130 |pmid=9809392 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borowsky IW 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borowsky IW, Hogan M, Ireland M |title=Adolescent sexual aggression: risk and protective factors |journal=Pediatrics |year=1997 |volume=100 |pages=E7 |doi=10.1542/peds.100.6.e7 |issue=6 |pmid=9382908}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gang rape is often perceived by male perpetrators as a justified method of discouraging or punishing what they consider as immoral behavior among women for example wearing short skirts or visiting bars. In some areas in [[Papua New Guinea]], women can actually be punished by public gang rape usually through permission by elders.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;Jenkins C.

== Effects ==
One metric used by the WHO to determine the severity of global rates of coercive, forced sexual activity was the question "Have you ever
been forced to have sexual intercourse against your will?" Asking this question produced higher positive response rates than being asked, whether they had ever been abused or raped.&lt;ref name="Krug2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Krug |title=Rapport mondial sur la violence et la santé |year=2002 |publisher=Organisation mondiale de la santé |location=Genève |isbn=978-92-4-154561-7 |url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/full_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some may remain in denial for years afterwards.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ndaa.org/pdf/pub_introducing_expert_testimony.pdf |title=Introducing expert testimony to explain victim behavior in sexual and domestic violence prosecutions |last=Long |first=Jennifer |date=2016 |website=NDAA.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=248189 |title=Victim Responses to Sexual Assault: Counterintuitive or Simply Adaptive |last= |first= |date= |website=www.ncjrs.gov |language=en|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confusion over whether or not their experience constitutes rape is typical, especially for victims of psychologically coerced rape. Women may not identify their victimization as rape for many reasons such as feelings of shame, embarrassment, non-uniform legal definitions, reluctance to define the friend/partner as a rapist, or because they have internalized victim-blaming attitudes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The public perceives these behaviors as 'counterintuitive' and therefore, as evidence of a dishonest woman.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

They may consolidate with time and sleep.&lt;ref name="Psych2013rev" /&gt;  A man or boy who is raped may be stimulated and even ejaculate during the experience of the rape.

Trauma symptoms may not show until years after the sexual assault occurred. Immediately following a rape, the survivor may react outwardly in a wide range of ways, from expressive to closed down; common emotions include distress, anxiety, shame, revulsion, helplessness, and guilt.&lt;ref name=Psych2013rev/&gt; Denial is not uncommon.&lt;ref name=Psych2013rev/&gt;

In the weeks following the rape, the survivor may develop symptoms of [[post traumatic stress syndrome]] and may develop wide array of psychosomatic complaints.&lt;ref name=Psych2013rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoffman2016&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hoffman |first1=Barbara, et al. |title=Williams Gynecology |date=2016 |publisher=McGraw Hill Professional |isbn=9780071849098 |edition= 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|310}} PTSD symptoms include re-experiencing of the rape, avoiding things associated with the rape, numbness, and increased anxiety and [[startle response]].&lt;ref name=Psych2013rev/&gt;  The likelihood of sustained severe symptoms is higher if the rapist confined or restrained the person, if the person being raped believed the rapist would kill them, the person who was raped was very young or very old, and if the rapist was someone they knew.&lt;ref name=Psych2013rev/&gt;  The likelihood of sustained severe symptoms is also higher if people around the survivor ignore (or are ignorant of) the rape or blame the rape survivor.&lt;ref name=Psych2013rev/&gt;

Most people recover from rape in three to four months, but many have persistent PTSD that may manifest in anxiety, depression, substance abuse, irritability, anger, flashbacks, or nightmares.&lt;ref name=Psych2013rev/&gt;  In addition, rape survivors may have long term [[generalised anxiety disorder]], may develop one or more [[specific phobia]]s, [[major depressive disorder]], and may experience difficulties with resuming their social life, and with sexual functioning.&lt;ref name=Psych2013rev/&gt;  People who have been raped are at higher risk of suicide.&lt;ref name=Male2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jina |first1=R |last2=Thomas |first2=LS |title=Health consequences of sexual violence against women. |journal=Best Practice &amp; Research.

Another effect of rape and sexual assault is the stress created in those who study rape or counsel the survivors. This is called [[vicarious traumatization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guidelines for the prevention and management of vicarious trauma among researchers of sexual and intimate partner violence |url=http://www.svri.org/sites/default/files/attachments/2016-06-02/SVRIVTguidelines.pdf |publisher=Sexual Violence Research Initiative |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical ===

The presence or absence of physical injury may be used to determine whether a rape has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=G |title=The (in)significance of genital injury in rape and sexual assault. |journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine |date=August 2015 |volume=34 |pages=173–8 |doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2015.06.007 |pmid=26165680}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who have experienced sexual assault yet have no physical trauma may be less inclined to report to the authorities or to seek health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kennedy |first=K.

While penetrative rape generally does not involve the use of a condom, in some cases a condom is used. This significantly reduces the likelihood of pregnancy and [[disease transmission]], both to the victim and to the rapist. Rationales for condom use include: avoiding contracting infections or diseases (particularly HIV), especially in cases of rape of [[sex worker]]s or in gang rape (to avoid contracting infections or diseases from fellow rapists); eliminating evidence, making prosecution more difficult (and giving a sense of invulnerability); giving the appearance of consent (in cases of acquaintance rape); and thrill from planning and the use of the condom as an added prop. Concern for the victim is generally not considered a factor.&lt;ref name="condom"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/22/nyregion/rapists-and-condoms-is-use-a-cavalier-act-or-a-way-to-avoid-disease-and-arrest.html |title=Rapists and Condoms; Is Use a Cavalier Act or a Way to Avoid Disease and Arrest? |first=Craig |last=Wolff |date=August 22, 1994 |newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victim blaming, secondary victimization and other mistreatment ===
{{Main|Victim blaming|Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims}}
Society's treatment of victims has the potential to exacerbate their trauma.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; People who have been raped or sexually assaulted are sometimes blamed and considered responsible for the crime.&lt;ref name="Maier2008" /&gt; This refers to the [[just-world hypothesis|just world fallacy]] and [[Rape myth|rape myth acceptance]] that certain victim behaviors (such as being intoxicated, [[flirting]] or wearing sexually [[provocation (legal)|provocative]] clothing) may encourage rape.&lt;ref&gt;Pauwels, B.

Women who have been raped are sometimes deemed to have behaved improperly. Usually, these are cultures where there is a significant social divide between the freedoms and status afforded to men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalforumhealth.org/filesupld/vaw/attitudes.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205184952/http://www.globalforumhealth.org/filesupld/vaw/attitudes.html |archivedate=2005-02-05 |title=Attitudes to sexual violence |date=2005-02-05 |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Rape victims are blamed more when they resist the attack later in the rape encounter rather than earlier (Kopper, 1996), which seems to suggest the stereotype that these women are engaging in token resistance (Malamuth &amp; Brown, 1994; Muehlenhard &amp; Rogers, 1998) or leading the man on because they have gone along with the sexual experience thus far. Finally, rape victims are blamed more when they are raped by an acquaintance or a date rather than by a stranger (e.g., Bell, Kuriloff, &amp; Lottes, 1994; Bridges, 1991; Bridges &amp; McGr ail, 1989; Check &amp; Malamuth, 1983; Kanekar, Shaherwalla, Franco, Kunju, &amp; Pinto, 1991; L'Armand &amp; Pepitone, 1982; Tetreault &amp; Barnett, 1987), which seems to evoke the stereotype that victims really want to have sex because they know their attacker and perhaps even went out on a date with him. The underlying message of this research seems to be that when certain stereotypical elements of rape are in place, rape victims are prone to being blamed."&lt;ref name = bud2001/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For females, victim-blaming correlates with fear. Many rape victims blame themselves. Female jurors might look at the woman on the witness stand and believe she had done something to entice the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmainteractive.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=27312&amp;Itemid=3158 |title=EMMA&amp;nbsp;— Most Londoners Believe Rape Victims are to Blame |publisher=Emmainteractive.com |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chinese culture, victim blaming often is associated with the crime of rape, as women are expected to resist rape using physical force. Thus, if rape occurs, it is considered to be at least partly the women’s fault and her virtue is called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Xue J, Fang G, Huang H, Cui N, Rhodes KV, Gelles R.

==== Honor killings and forced marriages ====

In many cultures, those who are raped have a high risk of suffering additional violence or threats of violence after the rape. This can be perpetrated by the rapist, friends, or relatives of the rapist. The intent can be to prevent the victim from reporting the rape.&amp;nbsp;Other reasons for threats against the those assaulted is to punish them for reporting it, or of forcing them to withdraw the complaint.&amp;nbsp;The relatives of the person who has been raped may wish to prevent "bringing shame" to the family and may also threaten them. This is especially the case in cultures where female virginity is highly valued and considered mandatory before marriage; in extreme cases, rape victims are killed in [[honor killings]].&lt;ref name="zeenews.india" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wisemuslimwomen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17379721 |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;— Morocco protest after raped Amina Filali kills herself |journal=BBC News |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
[[File:Non genital injuries to women who are sexually assaulted.PNG|thumb|upright=1.8|Non-genital injuries to women who are sexually assaulted]]
In the US, [[victims' rights]] include the right to have a victims advocate preside over every step of the medical/legal exam to ensure sensitivity towards victims, provide emotional support, and minimize the risk of re-traumatization. Victims are to be informed of this immediately by law enforcement or medical service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.victimlaw.org/victimlaw/pages/victimsRight.jsp |title=VictimLaw - Victims Right |website=www.victimlaw.org|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://victimsofcrime.org/help-for-crime-victims/get-help-bulletins-for-crime-victims/what-is-a-victim-advocate- |title=What is a Victim Advocate- |website=victimsofcrime.org|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emergency department|Emergency room]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of many hospitals employ sexual assault nurse/forensic examiners (SAN/FEs) with specific training to care for those who have experienced a rape or sexual assault. They are able to conduct a focused medical-legal exam.

=== Non-genital injuries ===

====Physical assessment====
Many rapes do not result in serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kennedy |first=K.

This general assessment will prioritize the treatment of injuries by the [[emergency room]] staff. Medical personnel involved are trained to assess and treat those assaulted or follow protocols established to ensure privacy and best treatment practices. Informed consent is always required prior to treatment unless the person who was assaulted is unconscious, intoxicated or does not have the mental capacity to give consent.&lt;ref name=Markovchick2016/&gt;&lt;ref name = mci2017/&gt; Priorities governing the physical exam are the treatment of serious life-threatening emergencies and then a general and complete assessment.&lt;ref name="HockettSaucier2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hockett |first1=Jericho M. |last2=Saucier |first2=Donald A. |title=A systematic literature review of "rape victims" versus "rape survivors": Implications for theory, research, and practice |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |volume=25 |year=2015 |pages=1–14 |issn=1359-1789 |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2015.07.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some physical injuries are readily apparent such as, [[human bites|bites]],&lt;ref name="NYJH" /&gt; broken teeth, [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]], [[bruising]], [[laceration]]s and scratches.

====Diagnostic testing====
After the general assessment and treatment of serious injuries, further evaluation may include the use of additional diagnostic testing such as [[x-rays]], [[computer-aided tomography|CT]] or [[MRI]] image studies and blood work. The presence of infection is determined by sampling of body fluids from the mouth, throat, vagina, [[perineum]], and [[anus]].&lt;ref name = mci2017/&gt;

====Forensic sampling====
{{Main|Rape investigation}}
Victims have the right to refuse any evidence collection. Victims advocates ensure the victims' wishes are respected by hospital staff. After the physical injuries are addressed and treatment has begun, then [[Forensic science|forensic examination]] proceeds along with the gathering of evidence that can be used to identify and document the injuries.&lt;ref name=Markovchick2016/&gt; Such [[evidence]]-gathering is only done with the complete consent of the patient or the [[caregiver]]s of the patient. Photographs of the injuries may be requested by staff.&lt;ref name = mci2017/&gt; At this point in the treatment, if a victims' advocate had not been requested earlier, experienced [[Counsel|social support staff]] are made available to the patient and family.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoffman |first=Barbara |title=Williams gynecology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location=New York |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-07-171672-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the patient or the caregivers, (typically parents) agree, the medical team utilizes standardized sampling and testing usually referred to a forensic evidence kit or "[[rape kit]]".&lt;ref name = mci2017/&gt; The patient is informed that submitting to the use of the rape kit does not [[obligation|obligate]] them to file [[criminal charges]] against the perpetrator. The patient is discouraged from bathing or showering for the purpose of obtaining samples from their hair.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt; Evidence gathered within the past 72 hours is more likely to be valid.&lt;ref name="mci2017" /&gt; The sooner that samples are obtained after the assault, the more likely that evidence is present in the sample and provide valid results. Once the injuries of the patient have been treated and she or he is stabilized, the sample gathering will begin. Staff will encourage the presence of a rape/sexual assault counselor to provide an advocate and reassurance.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt;

During the medical exam, evidence of bodily secretions is assessed. Dried semen that is on clothing and skin can be detected with a fluorescent lamp.&lt;ref name="mci2017" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Semen fluoresces best at wavelengths of 420 and 450 nm, when viewed through orange goggles. A Wood lamp emits light at only 360-nm wavelength. Therefore specialized alternate light sources that emit wavelengths at 420 and 450 nm, such as a Bluemaxx, should be used. Although this type of lamp will improve the detection of dried semen, many other substances will fluoresce as well; thus, confirmation of semen cannot be made with this method.", McInerny (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;  Notes will be attached to those items on which semen has been found. These specimens are marked, placed in a paper bag,&lt;ref&gt;This practice discourages the growth of microorganisms which could alter analysis. Cybulska&lt;/ref&gt; and be marked for later analysis for the presence of seminal vesicle-specific antigen.&lt;ref name="mci2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cybulska2013"/&gt;

Though technically, medical staff are not part of the legal system, only trained medical personnel can obtain evidence that is admissible during a trial. The procedures have been standardized. Evidence is collected, signed, and locked in a secure place to guarantee that legal evidence procedures are maintained. This is known as the [[chain of evidence]] and is a legal term that describes a carefully monitored procedure of evidence collection and preservation. Maintaining the Chain of evidence from the medical examination, testing and [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] sampling from its origin of collection to court allows the results of the sampling to be admitted as evidence.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt; The use of photography is often used for documentation.&lt;ref name="VAW2013" /&gt;&lt;!-- p 95 --&gt;

===After the examination===
Some physical effects of the rape are not immediately apparent. Follow up examinations also assess the patient for [[tension headaches]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], sleep pattern disturbances, gastrointestinal irritability, chronic pelvic pain, menstrual pain or irregularity, pelvic inflammatory disease, multiple yeast infections, sexual dysfunction, premenstrual distress, fibromyalgia, vaginal discharge, vaginal itching, burning during urination, and generalized vaginal pain.&lt;ref name="HockettSaucier2015" /&gt;

Women are typically offered [[contraceptive]] medications because about 5% of male-on-female rapes result in pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Varcarolis"&gt;{{cite book |author=Varcarolis, Elizabeth |year=2013 |title=Essentials of psychiatric mental health nursing |location=St. Louis |publisher=Elsevier |pages=439–442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genital injuries ===

An internal pelvic exam is not recommended for sexually immature or prepubescent girls due to the probability that internal injuries do not exist in this age group. An internal exam may be recommended if significant bloody discharge is observed, though.&lt;ref name="mci2017" /&gt; A complete [[pelvic exam]] for rape ([[anal rape|anal]] or vaginal) is conducted. An [[dentistry|oral exam]] is done if there have been [[injurie]]s to the mouth, teeth, gums or [[pharynx]]. Though the patient may have no complaints about [[genital pain]] signs of trauma can still be assessed. Prior to the complete bodily and genital exam, the patient is asked to undress, standing on a white sheet that collects any [[debris]] that may be in the clothing. The clothing and sheet are properly bagged and labeled along with other samples that can be removed from the body or clothing of the patient. Samples of [[fiber]]s, mud, hair, leaves are gathered if present. Samples of [[body fluid|fluids]] are collected to determine the presence of the perpetrator's [[saliva]] and [[semen]] that may be present in the patients mouth, [[vagina]] or [[rectum]]. Sometimes the victim has [[Abrasion (medical)|scratched]] the perpetrator in defense and fingernail scrapings can be collected.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt;

Injuries to the genital areas can be swelling, lacerations, and bruising.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Health &amp; physical assessment in nursing|last=Donita|first=D'Amico|publisher=|others=Barbarito, Colleen|isbn=9780133876406|edition= 3rd|location=Boston|pages=664|oclc=894626609|date = 2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common genital injuries are [[Rectal pain|anal injury]], labial abrasions, hymenal bruising, tears of the posterior [[Frenulum of labia minora|fourchette]] and fossa.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt; Bruises, tears, abrasions, inflammation and lacerations may be visible. If a foreign object was used during the assault, x-ray visualization will identify retained fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kr6ZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Forensic Gynaecology|last=Dalton|first=Maureen|date=2014-10-09|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107064294|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genital injuries are more prevalent in [[post-menopausal]] women and [[prepubescent]] girls. Internal injuries to the [[cervix]] and vagina can be visualized using [[colposcopy]]. Using colposcopy has increased the detection of internal trauma from six percent to fifty-three percent. Genital injuries to children who have been raped or sexually assaulted differ in that the abuse may be on-going or it happened in the past after the injuries heal. [[Scar]]ring is one sign of the sexual abuse of children.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt;

Several studies have explored the association between skin color and genital injury among rape victims. Many studies found a difference in rape-related injury based on race, with more injuries being reported for white females and males than for black females and males. This may be because the dark skin color of some victims obscures bruising. Examiners paying attention to victims with darker skin, especially the thighs, labia majora, posterior fourchette, and fossa navicularis, can help remedy this.&lt;ref&gt;Baker RB, Fargo JD, Shambley-Ebron D, Sommers MS. A source of healthcare disparity: Race, skin color, and injuries after rape among adolescents and young adults. Journal of Forensic Nursing, 2010; 6: 144-150&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infections ===

The presence of a sexually contracted infection can not be confirmed after rape because it cannot be detected until 72 hours afterwards.&lt;ref name = marc2015&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcdante |first=Karen |title=Nelson essentials of pediatrics |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-4557-5980-4}}&lt;sup&gt;[subscription required]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--no page numbers--&gt;

The person who was raped may already have a sexually transmitted bacterial, viral and other infections and if diagnosed, it is treated.&lt;ref name="Varcarolis" /&gt;&lt;ref name=VAW2013/&gt;&lt;!-- p 111 --&gt; Prophylactic antibiotic treatment for [[vaginitis]], [[gonorrhea]], [[trichomoniasis]] and [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] may be done. Chlamydial and gonococcal infections in women are of particular concern due to the possibility of ascending infection. [[Immunization]] against [[Hepatitis B vaccination|hepatitis B]] is often considered.&lt;ref name = marc2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="Varcarolis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cybulska2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cybulska |first1=Beata |title=Immediate medical care after sexual assault |journal=Best Practice &amp; Research Clinical Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology |volume=27 |issue=1 |year=2013 |pages=141–149 |issn=1521-6934 |doi=10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2012.08.013|pmid=23200638 }}&lt;sup&gt;[subscription required]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  After prophylactic treatment is initiated, further testing is done to determine what other treatments may be necessary for other infections transmitted during the assault.&lt;ref name="Varcarolis" /&gt; These are:

* Serum [[hepatitis B]] surface antigen assay
* Microscopic evaluation of [[vaginal discharge]] (saline wash and staining)
* [[Microbiological culture|Cultures]] for [[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]] and Chlamydia trachomatis from each penetrated location
* [[Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test|Serum Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test]]
* [[Complete blood count]] (CBC)
* [[Liver function tests]]
* [[Creatinine|Serum creatinine level]]&lt;ref name="Varcarolis" /&gt;

Treatment may include the administration of [[zidovudine]]/[[lamivudine]], [[tenofovir]]/[[emtricitabine]], [[ritonavir]]/[[lopinavir]]. Information regarding other treatment options are available from the CDC.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt;

The transmission of HIV is frequently a major concern of the patient.&lt;ref name=VAW2013/&gt;&lt;!-- p 111 --&gt; Prophylactic treatment for HIV is not necessarily administered. Routine treatment for HIV after rape or sexual assault is controversial due to the low risk of infection after one sexual assault. Transmission of HIV after one exposure to penetrative anal sex is estimated to be 0.5 to 3.2 percent. Transmission of HIV after one exposure to penetrative vaginal intercourse is 0.05 to 0.15 percent. HIV can also be contracted through the oral route but is considered rare.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Antiretroviral Postexposure Prophylaxis After Sexual, Injection-Drug Use, or Other Nonoccupational Exposure to HIV in the United States |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=21 January 2005 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5402a1.htm |accessdate=2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other recommendations are that the patient be treated prophylactically for HIV if the perpetrator is found to be infected.&lt;ref name="NYJH"&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV Clinical Resource: HIV Prophylaxis for Victims of Sexual Assault |publisher=Office of the Medical Director, New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute in Collaboration with Johns Hopkins University Division of Infectious Disease |url=http://www.hivguidelines.org/clinical-guidelines/post-exposure-prophylaxis/hiv-prophylaxis-for-victims-of-sexual-assault/ |accessdate=2015-12-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130135/http://www.hivguidelines.org/clinical-guidelines/post-exposure-prophylaxis/hiv-prophylaxis-for-victims-of-sexual-assault/|archivedate=2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing at the time of the initial exam does not typically have forensic value if patients are sexually active and have an STI since it could have been acquired prior to the assault. Rape shield laws protect the person who was raped and who has positive test results. These laws prevent having such evidence used against someone who was raped. Someone who was raped may be concerned that a prior infection may suggest sexual promiscuity. There may, however, be situations in which testing has the legal purpose, as in cases where the threat of transmission or actual transmission of an STI was part of the crime. In nonsexually active patients, an initial, baseline negative test that is followed by a subsequent STI could be used as evidence, if the perpetrator also had an STI.&lt;ref name=VAW2013/&gt;&lt;!-- p 111 --&gt;

Treatment failure is possible due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens.&lt;ref name="BaardaSikora2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baarda |first1=Benjamin I. |last2=Sikora |first2=Aleksandra E. |title=Proteomics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: the treasure hunt for countermeasures against an old disease |journal=Frontiers in Microbiology |volume=6 |pages=1190 |year=2015 |issn=1664-302X |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2015.01190|pmid=26579097 |pmc=4620152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotional and psychiatric ===

Psychiatric and emotional consequences can be apparent immediately after rape and it may be necessary to treat these very early in the evaluation and treatment.&lt;ref name=VAW2013&gt;{{cite book |title=Violence Against Women |date=April 2013 |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice - Office of Violence Against Women |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ovw/241903.pdf |accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other treatable emotional and psychiatric disorders may not become evident after the rape. These can be [[Eating disorder|eating]] disorders, anxiety, fear, intrusive thoughts, fear of crowds, avoidance, anger, depression, humiliation, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) hyperarousal, sexual disorders,(including fear of engaging in sexual activity), mood disorders, suicidal ideation, borderline personality disorder, nightmares, fear of situations that remind the patient of the rape and fear of being alone,&lt;ref name="HockettSaucier2015" /&gt; [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[numbness]] and emotional distance.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt; Victims are able to receive help by using a telephone hotline, [[counseling]], or shelters.&lt;ref name="Rosdahl" /&gt; Recovery from sexual assault is a complicated and controversial concept,&lt;ref name="Recovering from sexual assault" /&gt; but support groups, usually accessed by [[List of anti-sexual assault organizations in the United States|organizations]] are available to help in recovery. Professional counseling and on-going treatment by trained health care providers is often sought by the victim.&lt;ref name="Bud2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Budrionis |first=Rita |title=The sexual abuse victim and sexual offender treatment planner, with DSM-5 updates |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-119-07481-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are clinicians who are specially trained in the treatment of those who have experienced rape and sexual assault/abuse. Treatment can be lengthy and be challenging for both the counselor and the patient. Several treatment options exist and vary by accessibility, cost, or whether or not insurance coverage exists for the treatment. Treatment also varies dependent upon the expertise of the counselor—some have more experience and or have specialized in the treatment of sexual trauma and rape. To be the most effective, a treatment plan should developed based upon the struggles of the patient and not necessarily based upon the traumatic experience. An effective treatment plan will take the following into consideration: current stressors, coping skills, physical health, interpersonal conflicts, self-esteem, family issues, involvement of the guardian, and the presence of mental health symptoms.
&lt;ref name="Bud2015" /&gt;

The degree of success for emotional and psychiatric treatments is often dependent upon the terminology used in the treatment, i.e. redefining the event and experience. Labels used like "rape victim" and "rape survivor" to describe the new identities of women who have been raped suggest that the event is the dominant and controlling influence on her life. These may have an effect on supportive personnel. The consequences of using these labels needs to be assessed.&lt;ref name="HockettSaucier2015" /&gt; Positive outcomes of emotional and psychiatric treatment for rape exist; these can be an improved self-concept, the recognition of growth, and implementing new coping styles.&lt;ref name="HockettSaucier2015" /&gt;

A perpetrator found guilty by the court is often required to receive treatment. There are many options for treatment, some more successful than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Saleh |first=Fabian |title=Sex offenders identification, risk assessment, treatment, and legal issues |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford New York |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-517704-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological factors that motivated the convicted perpetrator are complex but treatment can still be effective. A counselor will typically evaluate disorders that are currently present in the offender. Investigating the developmental background of the offender can help explain the origins of the abusive behavior occurred in the first place. Emotional and psychological treatment has the purpose of identifying predictors of recidivism, or the potential that the offender will commit rape again. In some instances neurological abnormalities have been identified in the perpetrators, and in some cases they have themselves experienced past trauma. Adolescents and other children can be the perpetrators of rape, although this is uncommon. In this instance, appropriate counseling and evaluation are usually conducted.&lt;ref name="Kelly2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Gary |title=Sexuality today |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-07-353199-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short-term treatment with a [[benzodiazepine]] may help with anxiety and antidepressants may be helpful for symptoms of [[PTSD|post traumatic stress disorder]], depression and panic attacks.&lt;ref name="Varcarolis" /&gt;

Most rape research and reports of rape are limited to male-female forms of rape. Research [[Rape of males|on male-on-male and female-on-male rape]] is rare. Fewer than one in ten male-male rapes are reported. As a group, males who have been raped by either gender often get little services and support, and legal systems are often ill-equipped to deal with this type of crime. Instances in which the perpetrator is female, are not clear and lead to the denial of women being sexual aggressors. This could obscure the dimensions of the problem. Research also suggests that men with sexually aggressive peers have a higher chance of reporting coercive or forced sexual intercourse outside gang circles than men without such sexually aggressive peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gwartney-Gibbs PA, Stockard J, Bohmer S |title=Learning courtship aggression: the influence of parents, peers and personal experiences- |journal=[[Family Relations (journal)|Family Relations]] |year=1983 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=276–282 |doi=10.2307/583540 |jstor=583540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== False accusation ==
{{Main|False accusation of rape}}

A false accusation of rape is the reporting of a rape where no rape has occurred. It is difficult to assess the true prevalence of false rape allegations, but it's generally agreed by scholars that rape accusations are false about 2% to 10% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;DiCanio, M. (1993). ''The encyclopedia of violence: origins, attitudes, consequences''. New York: Facts on File. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-2332-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf|title=Statistics about sexual violence|last=|first=|date=2015|website=National Sexual Violence Resource Center|access-date=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lisak2010/&gt; In most cases, a false accusation will not name a specific suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weiser |first1=Dana M |title=Confronting Myths About Sexual Assault: A Feminist Analysis of the False Report Literature False Reports |journal=Family Relations |date=February 2017 |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=46 – 60 |doi=10.1111/fare.12235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight percent of 2,643 sexual assault cases were classified as false reports by the police in one study. The researchers noted that much of these classifications were based on the personal judgments and [[bias]]es of the police investigators and were made in violation of official criteria for establishing a [[false allegation]]. Closer analysis of this category applying the Home Office counting rules for establishing a false allegation, which requires "strong evidential grounds" of a false allegation or a "clear and credible" retraction by the complainant, reduced the percentage of false reports to 3%. The researchers concluded that "one cannot take all police designations at face value" and that "[t]here is an over-estimation of the scale of false allegations by both police officers and prosecutors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf|title=A gap or a chasm?

Another large-scale study was conducted in Australia, with the 850 rapes reported to the Victoria police between 2000 and 2003 (Heenan &amp; Murray, 2006). Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, the researchers examined 812 cases and found 15.1% of complaints were withdrawn, 46.4% were marked "no further police action", and 2.1% of the total were "clearly" classified by police as false reports. The researchers noted that where the police found a case to be a false allegation but didn't want to pursue charges against the accuser, they marked it as "no further police action" instead. All of these complainants were then charged or threatened with charges for filing a false police report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/app/abstractdb/AbstractDBDetails.aspx?id=243182 |title=Abstracts Database&amp;nbsp;— National Criminal Justice Reference Service |publisher=Ncjrs.gov |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) analyzed every rape complaint made over a 17-month period and found that "the indication is that it is therefore extremely rare that a suspect deliberately makes a false allegation of rape or domestic violence purely out of malice.".&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/03/13/false-rape-allegations-ra_n_2865823.html |title='Damaging Myths' About False Rape Accusations Harming Real Victims |last=UK |first=The Huffington Post |date=2013-03-13 |website=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.webcitation.org/6ItPWbBjp?url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/research/perverting_course_of_justice_march_2013.pdf Charging perverting the course of justice and wasting police time in cases involving allegedly false rape and domestic violence allegations]" Archived from: http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/research/perverting_course_of_justice_march_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
FBI reports consistently put the number of "unfounded" rape accusations around 8%. The unfounded rate is higher for forcible rape than for any other Index crime. The average rate of unfounded reports for Index crimes is 2%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091229015318/http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/Cius_97/96CRIME/96crime2.pdf Crime Index Offenses Reported].

Attorney General's Sexual Assault Task Force Oregon, US January 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Gross of the Forensic Examiner described it as meaningless, saying a report could be marked as unfounded if there is no physical evidence or the alleged victim did not sustain any physical injuries.

Other studies have suggested that the rate of false allegations in America may be higher. A nine-year study by Eugene J. Kanin of [[Purdue University]] in a small metropolitan area in the Midwestern United States claimed that 41% of rape accusations were false.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kanin |first=E.J. |title=An alarming national trend: False rape allegations |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=23 |number=1 |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[David Lisak]], an associate professor of psychology and director of the Men's Sexual Trauma Research Project at the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]] states that "Kanin's 1994 article on false allegations is a provocative opinion piece, but it is not a scientific study of the issue of false reporting of rape". He further states that Kanin's study has significantly poor systematic methodology and had no independent definition of a false report. Instead, Kanin classified reports that the police department classified as false also as false.&lt;ref name="VAW2"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Violence Against Women |url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/16/12/1318.full.pdf+html |volume=16 |issue=12 |title=False Allegations of Sexual Assault: An Analysis of Ten Years of Reported Cases |first=David |last=Lisak |first2=Lori |last2=Gardinier |last3=Nicksa |first3=Sarah C. |first4=Ashley M. |last4=Cote |year=2010 |doi=10.1177/1077801210387747 |pages=1318&amp;ndash;1334 |pmid=21164210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criterion for falsehood was simply a denial of a polygraph test of the accuser.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; A 1998 report by the [[National Institute of Justice]] found that DNA evidence excluded the primary suspect in 26% of rape cases and concluded that this "strongly suggests that postarrest and postconviction DNA exonerations are tied to some strong, underlying systemic problems that generate erroneous accusations and convictions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/dnaevid.pdf |last1=Connors |first1=Edward |last2=Lundregan |first2=Thomas |last3=Miller |first3=Neal |last4=McEwen |first4=Tom |title=Convicted by Juries, Exonerated by Science: Case Studies in the Use of DNA Evidence to Establish Innocence After Trial |publisher=National Institute of Justice |date=June 1996 |pages=xxviii–xxix}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study also noted that analyzed samples involved a specific subset of rape cases (e.g. those where "there is no consent defense").

A 2010 study by David Lisak, Lori Gardinier and other researchers published in the journal of [[Violence Against Women (journal)|''Violence against Women'']] found that out of 136 cases reported in a ten-year period, 5.9% were found likely to be false.&lt;ref name=Lisak2010&gt;{{Cite journal |title=False Allegations of Sexual Assault: An Analysis of Ten Years of Reported Cases |url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/16/12/1318 |journal=Violence Against Women |date=2010-12-01 |issn=1077-8012 |pmid=21164210 |pages=1318–1334 |volume=16 |issue=12 |doi=10.1177/1077801210387747 |language=en |first=David |last=Lisak |first2=Lori |last2=Gardinier |first3=Sarah C. |last3=Nicksa |first4=Ashley M. |last4=Cote}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of rape}}

=== Definitions and evolution of laws ===
Virtually all societies have had a concept of the crime of rape. Although what constituted this crime has varied by historical period and culture, the definitions tended to focus around an act of forced vaginal intercourse perpetrated through physical violence or imminent threat of death or severe bodily injury, by a man, on a woman or a girl, not his wife. The [[actus reus]] of the crime, was, in most societies, the insertion of the penis into the vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=mdZktFIzfCgC}} |title=Development of Global Prohibition Regimes: Pillage and Rape in War - Tuba Inal |publisher= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=X_w83yCJCOQC}} |title=The Routledge History of Sex and the Body: 1500 to the Present |publisher= |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way sexuality was conceptualized in many societies rejected the very notion that a woman could force a man into sex&amp;nbsp;— women were often seen as passive while men were deemed to be assertive and aggressive. Sexual penetration of a male by another male fell under the legal domain of [[sodomy]].

[[Rape law]]s existed to protect [[virgin]]al daughters from rape. In these cases, a rape done to a woman was seen as an attack on the estate of her father because she was his property and a woman's virginity being taken before marriage lessened her value; if the woman was married, the rape was an attack on the husband because it violated his property.&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;{{cite book|author=Teela Sanders|title=Sex Offenses and Sex Offenders|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2012|page=82|accessdate=28 January 2017|isbn =978-0190213633|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rb5LDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yllö"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Kersti Yllö, M.

From the classical antiquity of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] into the [[Colonialism|Colonial period]], rape along with arson, [[treason]] and murder was a [[capital offense]]. "Those committing rape were subject to a wide range of capital punishments that were seemingly brutal, frequently bloody, and at times spectacular." In the 12th century, kinsmen of the victim were given the option of executing the punishment themselves. "In England in the early fourteenth century, a victim of rape might be expected to gouge out the eyes and/or sever the offender's testicles herself."&lt;ref&gt;"The Medieval Blood Sanction and the Divine Beneficene of Pain: 1100–1450", Trisha Olson, ''Journal of Law and Religion'', 22 JLREL 63 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the harshness of these laws, actual punishments were usually far less severe: in late Medieval Europe, cases concerning rapes of marriageable women, wives, widows, or members of the lower class were rarely brought forward, and usually ended with only a small monetary fine or a marriage between the victim and the rapist.&lt;ref name="Eckman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eckman |first=Zoe |url=http://medievalists.net/files/11020201.pdf |title=An Oppressive Silence: The Evolution of the Raped Woman in Medieval France and England |journal=Historian: Journal of the Undergraduate History Department at New York University |volume=50 |year=2009 |pages=68–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ancient Greece and Rome, both male-on-female and male-on-male concepts of rape existed. Roman laws allowed three distinct charges for the crime: ''stuprum'', unsanctioned sexual intercourse (which, in the early times, also included adultery); ''vis'', a physical assault for purpose of lust; and ''iniuria'', a general charge denoting any type of assault upon person. Aforementioned ''Lex Iulia'' specifically criminalized ''per vim stuprum'', unsanctioned sexual intercourse by force. The former two were public criminal charges which could be brought whenever the victim was a woman or a child of either gender, but only if the victim was a freeborn Roman citizen (''[[ingenui|ingenuus]]''), and carried potential sentence of death or exile.  ''Iniuria'' was a civil charge that demanded monetary compensation, and had a wider application (for example, it could have been brought in case of sexual assault on a slave by a person other than their owner.) [[Augustus]] Caesar enacted reforms for the crime of rape under the assault statute ''Lex Iulia de vi publica'', which bears his family name, ''Iulia''. It was under this statute rather than the adultery statute of ''Lex Iulia de adulteriis'' that Rome prosecuted this crime.&lt;ref&gt;James Fitzjames Stephen, ''A History of the Criminal Law of England'', p. 17 [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=jecTHASFYeUC }}]&lt;/ref&gt; Rape was made into a "public wrong" (''iniuria publica'') by the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]].&lt;ref&gt;George Mousourakis, ''The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law'' p. 30 [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=8qE1zFHyGXoC }}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, James A., "Rape and Seduction in Medieval Canon Law", in ''Sexual Practices and the Medieval Church'', edited by Vern L. Bullough and James Brundage, Buffalo, 1982, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the modern understanding of the subject, Romans drew clear distinctions between "active" (penetrative) and "passive" (receptive) partners, and all these charges implied penetration by the assailant (which necessarily ruled out the possibility of female-on-male or female-on-female rape.) It is not clear which (if any) of these charges applied to assaults upon an adult male, though such an assault upon a citizen was definitely seen as a grave insult (within Roman culture, an adult male citizen could not possibly consent to the receptive role in a sexual intercourse without a severe loss of status.) The law known as [[Lex Scantinia]] covered at least some forms of male-on-male ''stuprum'', and [[Quintillian]] mentions a fine of 10,000 sesterces – about 10 years worth of a Roman legionnaire's pay – as a normal penalty for ''stuprum'' upon an ''ingenuus''. However, its text is lost and its exact provisions are no longer known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1084&amp;context=mjgl |title=Roman Rape: An Overview of Roman Rape Laws from the Republican Period to Justinian's Reign |author=Nghiem L. Nguyen |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor [[Justinian]] continued the use of the statute to prosecute rape during the sixth century in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Justinian]] [http://www.constitution.org/sps/sps02_j1-4.htm ''Institutiones'']&lt;/ref&gt; By [[late antiquity]], the general term ''raptus'' had referred to abduction, [[elopement]], robbery, or rape in its modern meaning. Confusion over the term led ecclesiastical commentators on the law to differentiate it into ''raptus seductionis'' (elopement without parental consent) and ''raptus violentiae'' (ravishment). Both of these forms of ''raptus'' had a civil penalty and possible excommunication for the family and village receiving the abducted woman, although ''raptus violentiae'' also incurred punishments of mutilation or death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Basil of Caesarea]], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf208.ix.cclxxi.html ''Letters''] circa 374 AD&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a husband could not be charged with raping his wife until 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://time.com/3975175/spousal-rape-case-history/ |title=When Spousal Rape First Became a Crime in the U.S. |last=Rothman |first=Lily |website=Time|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, in some states in the US, a white woman having consensual sex with a black man was considered rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Challenge of Defining Rape |date=11 October 2014 |last=Urbina |first=Ian |publisher=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/sunday-review/being-clear-about-rape.html?_r=0|access-date= 5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 1930s, rape was considered a [[sex crime]] that was always committed by men and always done to women. From 1935–1965, a shift from labeling rapists as criminals to believing them to be mentally ill "sexual [[psychopaths]]" began making its way into popular opinion. Men caught for committing rape were no longer sentenced to prison but admitted to mental health hospitals where they would be given medication for their illness.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997&gt;Maschke, Karen J. ''The Legal Response to Violence against Women''. New York: Garland Pub., 1997. {{ISBN|9780815325192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because only men deemed insane were the ones considered to have committed rape, no one considered the everyday person to be capable of such violence.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;

Transitions in women's roles in society were also shifting, causing alarm and blame towards rape victims. Because women were becoming more involved in the public (i.e. searching for jobs rather than being a housewife), some people claimed that these women were "loose" and looking for trouble. Giving up the [[gender role]]s of mother and wife was seen as defiant against traditional values while immersing themselves within society created the excuse that women would "not [be] entitled to protection under the traditional guidelines for male-female relationships".&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;

Until the 19th century, many jurisdictions required [[ejaculation]] for the act to constitute the offense of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=mdZktFIzfCgC}} |title=Development of Global Prohibition Regimes: Pillage and Rape in War - Tuba Inal |publisher= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=X_w83yCJCOQC}} |title=The Routledge History of Sex and the Body: 1500 to the Present |publisher= |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acts other than vaginal intercourse did not constitute rape in [[common law]] countries and in many other societies. In many cultures, such acts were illegal, even if they were consensual and performed between married couples (see [[sodomy laws]]). In England, for example, the [[Buggery Act 1533]], which remained in force until 1828, provided for the death penalty for "[[buggery]]". Many countries criminalized "non-traditional" forms of sexual activity well into the modern era: notably, in the US state of [[Idaho]], sodomy between consensual partners was punishable by a term of five years to life in prison as late as 2003, and this law was only ruled to be inapplicable to married couples in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/sensibilities/idaho.htm |last=Painter |first=George |title=The History of Sodomy Laws in the United States - Idaho |website=Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives of the Pacific Northwest |accessdate=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, in many countries, the definition of the actus reus has been extended to all forms of penetration of the vagina and anus (e.g. penetration with objects, fingers or other body parts) as well as insertion of the penis in the mouth.

In the United States, before and during the [[American Civil War]] when [[chattel slavery]] was widespread, the law focused primarily on rape as it pertained to black men raping white women. The penalty for such a crime in many jurisdictions was death or castration. The rape of a black woman, by any man, was considered legal.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997 /&gt; As early as the 19th century, American women were criticized if they "stray[ed] out of a [dependent] position...fought off [an] attacker...[or] behaved in too self reliant a manner..." in which case "the term rape no longer applied".&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Arnold, Marybeth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30020">The [[social norm]] of '''reciprocity''' is the expectation that people will respond to each other in similar ways—responding to gifts and kindnesses from others with similar benevolence of their own, and responding to harmful, hurtful acts from others with either indifference or some form of retaliation. Such norms can be crude and mechanical, such as a literal reading of the [[eye for an eye|eye-for-an-eye]] rule [[lex talionis]], or they can be complex and sophisticated, such as a subtle understanding of how anonymous donations to an international organization can be a form of reciprocity for the receipt of very personal benefits, such as the love of a parent.
 
The [[norm of reciprocity]] varies widely in its details from situation to situation, and from society to society.  Anthropologists and sociologists have often claimed, however, that having some version of the norm appears to be a social inevitability.&lt;ref&gt;Gouldner, Alvin.  “The Norm of Reciprocity.”  ''American Sociological Review'' 25 (1960): 161-78.&lt;/ref&gt; Reciprocity figures prominently in [[social exchange theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter M.

Willis, eds.  ''Social Exchange:  Advances in Theory and Research''.

Revised edition''.  New York: Basic Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patterns of reciprocity==
'''One-to-one reciprocity'''.Some reciprocal relationships are direct one-to-one arrangements between individuals, or between institutions, or between governments. Some of these are one-time arrangements, and others are embedded in long-term relationships.  Families often have expectations that children will reciprocate for the care they receive as infants by caring for their elderly parents; businesses may have long-term contractual obligations with each other: governments make treaties with each other.

There are also one-to-one reciprocal relationships that are indirect.  For example, there are sometimes long chains of exchanges, in which A gives a benefit to B, who passes on a similar benefit to C, and so on, in which each party in the chain expects that what goes around will eventually come back around.  The classic anthropological example is the [[Kula ring|Kula exchange]] in the Trobriand Islands.

'''One-to-many and many-to-one reciprocity''' often lies somewhere between direct reciprocal arrangements and generalized reciprocity. Informal clubs in which the hosting arrangements circulate among members are examples of the one-to-many variety.  Bridal showers are examples of the many-to-one variety. So are [[barn raising]] practices in some frontier communities. All of these are similar to direct reciprocity, since the beneficiaries are identified as such in each case, and contributors know exactly what they can expect in return. But because membership in the group changes, and needs for new meetings or marriages or barns are not always predictable, these cases differ significantly from precisely defined one-to-one cases.

'''Generalized reciprocity''' is even less precise.  Here donors operate within a large network of social transactions largely unknown to each other, and without expectations about getting specific benefits in return — other than, perhaps, the sort of social insurance provided by the continuance of the network itself. Recipients may not know the donors, and may not themselves be able to make a return in-kind to that network, but perhaps feel obligated to make a return to a similar network. Blood banks and food banks are examples.  But in fact any stable social structure in which there is a division of labor will involve a system of reciprocal exchanges of this generalized sort, as a way of sustaining [[social norms]].

All of these patterns of reciprocity, along with related ideas such as [[gratitude]], have been central to social and political philosophy from Plato onward.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Lawrence C. ''Reciprocity''.  London and New York: Routledge, 1986. Contains bibliographic essays.&lt;/ref&gt;  These philosophical discussions concern the ways in which patterns and norms of reciprocity might have a role in theories of justice, stable and productive social systems, healthy personal relationships, and ideals for human social life generally.

==The concept of reciprocity==
{{or-section|date=December 2012}}
Philosophical work on reciprocity often pays considerable attention, directly or indirectly, to the proper interpretation of one or more of the following conceptual issues.

'''Reciprocity as distinct from related ideas'''.  In [[Plato]]’s [[Crito]], Socrates considers whether citizens might have a duty of gratitude to obey the laws of the state, in much the way they have duties of gratitude to their parents.  Many other philosophers have considered similar questions. (See the references below to Sidgwick, English, and Jecker for modern examples.) This is certainly a legitimate question. Charging a child or a citizen with ingratitude can imply a failure to meet a requirement.  But confining the discussion to gratitude is limiting. There are similar limitations in discussions of the do-unto-others [[ethic of reciprocity|golden rule]], or ethical principles that are modeled on the mutuality and mutual benevolence that come out of the [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] relations envisaged by [[Emmanuel Levinas]] or the [[I-Thou]] relationships described by [[Martin Buber]]. Like gratitude, these other ideas have things in common with the norm of reciprocity, but are quite distinct from it.
  
[[Gratitude]], in its ordinary sense, is as much about having warm and benevolent feelings toward one’s benefactors as it is about having obligations to them. Reciprocity, in its ordinary dictionary sense, is broader than that, and broader than all discussions that begin with a sense of mutuality and mutual benevolence. (See the reference below to Becker, ''Reciprocity'', and the bibliographic essays therein.) Reciprocity pointedly covers arm’s-length dealings between egoistic or mutually disinterested people.
 
Moreover, norms of gratitude do not speak very directly about what feelings and obligations are appropriate toward wrongdoers, or the malicious.  Reciprocity, by contrast, speaks directly to both sides of the equation – requiring responses in kind: positive for positive, negative for negative. In this, it also differs from the golden rule, which is compatible with forgiveness and “turning the other cheek” but has notorious difficulties as a basis for corrective justice, [[punishment]], and dealing with people (e.g., masochists) who have unusual motivational structures.

Finally, the idea of enforcing, or carrying out a duty of gratitude, as well as calibrating the extent one’s gratitude, seems inconsistent with the warm and benevolent feelings of  “being grateful.” There is a similar inconsistency in the idea of enforcing a duty to love. Reciprocity, by contrast, because it does not necessarily involve having special feelings of love or benevolence, fits more comfortably into discussions of duties and obligations. Further, its requirement of an in-kind response invites us to calibrate both the quality and the quantity of the response. 
 
The norm of reciprocity thus requires that we make fitting and proportional responses to both the benefits and harms we receive – whether they come from people who have been benevolent or malicious. Working out the conceptual details of this idea presents interesting questions of its own. The following matters are all considered at length in many of the sources listed below under References, and those authors typically defend particular  proposals about how best to define the conceptual details of reciprocity. What follows here is simply an outline of the topics that are under philosophical scrutiny.

'''Qualitative similarity'''. What counts as making a qualitatively appropriate or “fitting” response in various settings—positive for positive, negative for negative?  If one person invites another to dinner, must the other offer a dinner in return? How soon?  Must it be directly to the original benefactor, or will providing a comparable favor to someone else be appropriate? If the dinner one receives is unintentionally awful, must one reciprocate with something similarly awful? Sometimes an immediate tit-for-tat response seems inappropriate, and at other times it is the only thing that will do.

Are there general principles for assessing the qualitative appropriateness of reciprocal responses?  Reflective people typically practice a highly nuanced version of the norm of reciprocity for social life, in which the qualitative similarity or fittingness of the response appears to be determined by a number of factors.

''The nature of the transaction''. One is the general nature of the transaction or relationship between the parties – the rules and expectations involved in a particular interaction itself.  Tit for tat, defined in a literal way as an exchange of the identical kinds of goods (client list for client list, referral for referral) may be the only sort of reciprocal response that is appropriate in a clearly defined business situation. Similarly, dinner-for-dinner may be the expectation among members of a round robin dinner club.  But when the nature of the transaction is more loosely defined, or is embedded in a complex personal relationship, an appropriate reciprocal response often requires spontaneity, imagination, and even a lack of premeditation about where, what, and how soon.

''Fitting the response to the recipient''. Another aspect of qualitative fit is what counts subjectively, for the recipient, as a response in-kind.   When we respond to people who have benefited us, it seems perverse to give them things they do not regard as benefits.  The general principle here is that, other things equal, a return of good for good received will require giving something that will actually be appreciated as good by the recipient – at least eventually. Similarly for the negative side.  When we respond to bad things, reciprocity presumably requires a return that the recipient regards as a bad thing.

''Unusual circumstances''. A third aspect of qualitative fit is the presence or absence of circumstances that undermine the usual expectations about reciprocity.  If a pair of friends often borrow each other’s household tools, and one of them (suddenly deranged with anger) asks to borrow an antique sword from the other’s collection, what is a fitting response? The example, in a slightly different form, goes back to [[Plato]].  The point is that in this unusual circumstance, reciprocity (as well as other considerations) may require that the recipient not get what he wants at the moment.  Rather, it may be that the recipient should be given what he needs, in some objective sense, whether he ever comes to appreciate that it is good for him.

''General rationale''. A final determinant of qualitative fit is the general rationale for having the norm of reciprocity in the first place. For example, if the ultimate point of practicing reciprocity is to produce stable, productive, fair, and reliable social interactions, then there may be some tensions between things that accomplish this general goal and things that satisfy only the other three determinants.  Responding to others’ harmful conduct raises this issue.  As [[Plato]] observed ([[Republic]], Book I), is not rational to harm our enemies in the sense of making them worse, as enemies or as people, than they already are.  We may reply to Plato by insisting that reciprocity merely requires us to make them worse-off, not worse, period. But if it turns out that the version of the reciprocity norm we are using actually has the consequence of doing both, or at any rate not improving the situation, then we will have undermined the point of having it.

''Quantitative similarity''.  Another definitional issue concerns proportionality.   What counts as too little, or too much in return for what we receive from others?  In some cases, such as borrowing a sum of money from a friend who has roughly the same resources, a prompt and exact return of the same amount seems right.  Less will be too little, and a return with interest will often be too much, between friends.  But in other cases, especially in exchanges between people who are very unequal in resources, a literal reading of tit-for-tat may be a perverse rule – one that undermines the social and personal benefits of the norm of reciprocity itself.  How, for example, may badly disadvantaged people reciprocate for the public or private assistance they receive?   Requiring a prompt and exact return of the benefit received may defeat the general purpose of the norm of reciprocity by driving disadvantaged people further into debt.  Yet to waive the debt altogether, or to require only some discounted amount seems to defeat the purpose also.

Anglo-American legal theory and practice has examples of two options for dealing with this problem.  One is to require a return that is equal to the benefit received, but to limit the use of that requirement in special cases.  Bankruptcy rules are in part designed to prevent downward, irrecoverable spirals of debt while still exacting a considerable penalty. Similarly, there are rules for rescinding unconscionable contracts, preventing unjust enrichment, and dealing with cases in which contractual obligations have become impossible to perform. These rules typically have considerable transaction costs.

Another kind of option is to define a reciprocal return with explicit reference to ability to pay. Progressive tax rates are an example of this. Considered in terms of reciprocity, this option seems based on an equal sacrifice interpretation of proportionality, rather than an equal benefit one.  Under an equal sacrifice rule, making a quantitatively similar return will mean giving something back whose marginal value to oneself, given one’s resources, equals the marginal value of the sacrifice made by the original giver, given her resources.

==Reciprocity and justice==
Standard usage of the term justice shows its close general connection to the concept of reciprocity. Justice includes the idea of fairness, and that in turn includes treating similar cases similarly, giving people what they deserve, and apportioning all other benefits and burdens in an equitable way. Those things, further, involve acting in a principled, impartial way that forbids playing favorites and may require sacrifices.  All of those things are certainly in the neighborhood of the elements of reciprocity (e.g., fittingness, proportionality), but it is challenging to explain the precise connections.

===Reward and punishment===
Discussions of merit, desert, blame, and [[punishment]] inevitably involve questions about the fittingness and proportionality of our responses to others, and retributive theories of punishment put the norm of reciprocity at their center. The idea is to make the punishment fit the crime.  This differs from utilitarian theories of punishment, which may use fittingness and proportionality as constraints, but whose ultimate commitment is to make punishment serve social goals such as general deterrence, public safety, and the rehabilitation of wrongdoers.

===Justice and war===
In [[Just war|just war theory]], notions of fittingness and proportionality are central, at least as constraints both on the justification of a given war, and the methods used to prosecute it. When war represents a disproportionate response to a threat or an injury, it raises questions of justice related to reciprocity.  When war fighting employs weapons that do not discriminate between combatants and noncombatants, it raises questions of justice related to reciprocity. A profound sense of injustice related to a lack of reciprocity – for example, between those privileged by socioeconomic status, political power, or wealth, and those who are less privileged, and oppressed – sometimes leads to war in the form of revolutionary or counterrevolutionary violence. It has been argued that the use of autonomous or remote controlled weaponized drones violate reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2013/07/18/just-war-theory-and-the-ethics-of-drone-warfare/|title=Just War Theory and the Ethics of Drone Warfare|work=E-International Relations|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Drone warfare and morality in riskless war|journal=Global Affairs|volume=1|issue=3|pages=285–291|doi=10.1080/23340460.2015.1080042|year = 2015|last1 = Henriksen|first1 = Anders|last2=Ringsmose|first2=Jens}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political solutions which end the violence without dealing with the underlying injustice run the risk of continued social instability.

===Legitimation of social, political, and legal obligations===
A very deep and persistent line of philosophical discussion explores the way in which reciprocity can resolve conflicts between justice and self-interest, and can justify the imposition (or limitation) of social, political, and legal obligations that require individuals to sacrifice their own interests.

This aspect of the philosophical discussion of reciprocity attempts to bring together two ways of approaching a very basic question: What is the fundamental justification for the existence of social and political institutions – institutions that impose and enforce duties and obligations upon their members?

'''Individual well-being'''. One obvious answer is that people need to stay out of each other’s way enough so that each can pursue his or her individual interests as far as possible, without interference from others.  This immediately justifies rules that are mutually advantageous, but it raises questions about requiring obedience from people whenever it turns out that they will be disadvantaged by following the rules, or can get away with disobeying them.  So the problem becomes one of showing whether, and when, it might actually be mutually advantageous to follow the rules of justice even when it is inconvenient or costly to do so.

[[Social contract]] theorists often invoke the value of reciprocal relationships to deal with this. Many human beings need help from one another from time to time in order to pursue their individual interests effectively.  So if we can arrange a system of reciprocity in which all the benefits we are required to contribute are typically returned to us in full (or more), that may justify playing by the rules—even in cases where it looks as though we can get away with not doing so.

'''Social well-being'''. Another obvious answer to the question of why people organize themselves into groups, however, is in order to achieve levels of cooperation needed for improving society generally – for example by improving public health, and society-wide levels of education, wealth, or individual welfare.  This also gives a reason for rules of justice, but again raises problems about requiring individuals to sacrifice their own welfare for the good of others—especially when some individuals might not share the particular goals for social improvements at issue.

Here too, the value of reciprocal relationships can be invoked, this time to limit the legitimacy of the sacrifices a society might require. For one thing, it seems perverse to require sacrifices in pursuit of some social goal if it turns out those sacrifices are unnecessary, or in vain because the goal cannot be achieved.

To some philosophers, a theory of justice based on reciprocity (or fairness, or fair play) is an attractive middle ground between a thoroughgoing concern with individual well-being and a thoroughgoing concern with social well-being. This has been part of the attraction of the most influential line of thought on distributive justice in recent Anglo-American philosophy – the one carried on in the context of [[John Rawls]]’ work.

'''Future generations'''.  It may also be that there is something to be gained, philosophically, from considering what obligations of generalized reciprocity present generations of human beings may have to future ones.  [[John Rawls|Rawls]] considers (briefly) the problem of defining a “just savings principle” for future generations, and treats it as a consequence of the interests people typically have in the welfare of their descendents, and the agreements fully reciprocal members of society would come to among themselves about such matters.  Others (e.g., [[Lawrence C. Becker|Lawrence Becker]]) have explored the intuitive idea that acting on behalf of future generations may be required as a generalized form of reciprocity for benefits received from previous generations.

==Mutuality==
What is the relation between reciprocity and [[love]], [[friendship]] or [[family]] relationships? If such relationships are ideally ones in which the parties are connected by mutual affection and benevolence, shouldn’t justice and reciprocity stay out of their way? Isn’t impartiality inconsistent with love? Doesn’t acting on principle take the affection out of friendship or family relationships?  Doesn’t following the norm of reciprocity eliminate unconditional love or loyalty?

Some contemporary philosophers have criticized major figures in the history of Western philosophy, including [[John Rawls]]’ early work, for making familial relationships more or less opaque in theories of justice. (See the reference below to [[Susan Moller Okin|Okin]].) The argument is that families can be grossly unjust, and have often been so.  Since the family is “the school of justice,” if it is unjust the moral education of children is distorted, and the injustice tends to spread to the society at large, and to be perpetuated in following generations. If that is right, then justice and reciprocity must define the boundaries within which we pursue even the most intimate relationships.
  
A somewhat different thread on these matters begins with [[Aristotle]]’s discussion of friendship, in ''Nicomachean Ethics'' 1155-1172a.  He proposes that the highest or best form of friendship involves a relationship between equals – one in which a genuinely reciprocal relationship is possible. This thread appears throughout the history of Western ethics in discussions of personal and social relationships of many sorts: between children and parents, spouses, humans and other animals, and humans and god(s). The question is the extent to which the kind of reciprocity possible in various relationships determines the kind of mutual affection and benevolence possible in those relationships.

This said, reciprocation in personal relationships rarely follows a mathematical formula and the level of reciprocation, i.e. the give and take, will vary depending on the personalities involved, and situational factors such as which party has more control, persuasive power or influence. It is often the case that one party will typically be the lead reciprocator with the other being the responsive reciprocator.  The form of reciprocation can also be influenced by the level of emotional need. Sometimes one party will need more support than the other and this can switch at different times depending on the life situation of each party.  Because reciprocation is influenced by personal circumstances and since people do not follow a set pattern like robots, reciprocation from a friend to a friend for example will vary in intensity and an absolutely consistent pattern cannot be expected.  If for example a person has a large inner circle of friendships with reciprocation as the key element of friendship, then the level of reciprocation within the inner circle will influence the depth of a friendship therein.  Reciprocation can be responsive or initiative.  It is also a fundamental principle in parenting, a successful work place, religion and karma.

So for example, in the friendship context, reciprocation means to give or take mutually but not necessarily equally. Overall reciprocal balance is more important than strict equality at every moment. Friendship based on reciprocity means caring for each other, being responsive and supportive and in tune with each other. But without some form of overall reciprocal balance, the relationship may become transformed into a nonreciprocal form of friendship, or the friendship may fail altogether.

To provide an everyday life example, should one's (person A) dog die, a good friend (person B) would offer support and a "shoulder to cry on" for person A struggling to deal with the death of their dog. After time, person B might suggest a new dog, to help person A move on from their loss. Reciprocation occurs from person A to person B, if person B obtains assistance from person A at a future time.

Skeletons were rediscovered in 1942 by a [[Nanda Devi National Park|Nanda Devi game reserve]] ranger Hari Kishan Madhwal, although there are reports about these bones from the late-19th century. At first, British authorities feared that the skeletons represented casualties of a hidden Japanese invasion force, but it was found that the skeletons were far too old to be Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref name="Obscura" /&gt; The skeletons are visible in the clear water of the shallow lake during a one-month period when the ice melts.&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt; Along with the skeletons, wooden artifacts, iron spearheads, leather slippers,&lt;ref name="riddle"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?225620 | title  = Bones Of A Riddle | author = Hari Menon | date = 2004-11-08 | accessdate = 2013-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and rings were also found.

Local legend says that the King of Kanauj, Raja Jasdhaval, with his pregnant wife, Rani Balampa, their servants, a dance troupe and others went on a pilgrimage to Nanda Devi shrine, and the group faced a storm with large hailstones, from which the entire party perished near Roopkund Lake.&lt;ref name=missing1&gt;{{cite news|title=Roopkund's human skeletons go missing|url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Sep242007/national2007092326962.asp|accessdate=31 May 2013|newspaper=Deccan Herald|date=24 September 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128081408/http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Sep242007/national2007092326962.asp|archivedate=28 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=legend&gt;{{cite book|last=Vicki|first=Pomeroy|title=Deep in the Indian Himalaya|year=2007|publisher=Garhwal Publishing|isbn=9780615156972|page=63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VL2022JhuKMC&amp;dq=Roopkund&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remnants belonging to more than 300 people have been found. [[Radiocarbon dating]] of the bones at Oxford University's Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit determined the time period to be 850 CE ±30 years.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The Anthropological Survey of India conducted a study of the skeletons during the 1950s and some samples are displayed at the Anthropological Survey of India Museum, [[Dehradun]].&lt;ref name=protect/&gt;

=== Identification ===
Genome-wide DNA study of  skeletons from Roopkund by Harney et al. 2018 revealed that the skeletons belonged to two distinct groups; one group is composed of individuals with broadly South-Asian related ancestry from 9th CE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=8th International Symposium on Biomolecular Archaeology |url=https://www.isba8.de/fileadmin/congress/media/isba2018/druckelemente/ISBA2018%20Programm.pdf |website=isba8.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the second group is composed of individuals from 200 years ago with genetic affinity with east mediterraneans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Roopkund skeletons 200 years old |url=https://twitter.com/amwkim/status/1042429090249302017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The studies of the skeletons revealed a common cause of death: blows to the back of the head, caused by round objects falling from above. The researchers concluded that the victims had been caught in a sudden hailstorm, just as described in the local legends and songs.&lt;ref name="Obscura" /&gt;

===Conservation concerns===
There is a growing concern about the regular loss of skeletons and it is feared that, if steps are not taken to conserve them, the skeletons may gradually vanish in the years to come.&lt;ref name=vanish&gt;{{cite web|title=Skeletons:AWOL|url=http://uttarakhand.org/2005/07/statesman-2005716-skeletons-awol/|work=Satesman 16.7.2005|publisher=uttarakhand.org (Govt. website)|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that tourists visiting the area are in the habit of taking back the skeletons in large numbers and the district administration has expressed the need to protect the area.&lt;ref name=protect&gt;{{cite news|last=Kazmi|first=SMA|title=Tourists to Roopkund trek back with human skeletons |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/tourists-to-roopkund-trek-back-with-human-skeletons/238208/|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=12 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district magistrate of Chamoli District has reported that tourists, trekkers, and curious researchers are transporting the skeletons on [[mule]]s and recommended that the area should be protected.&lt;ref name=missing1/&gt; Governmental agencies have made efforts to develop the area as an eco-tourism destination in an effort to protect the skeletons.&lt;ref name=eco&gt;{{cite news|last=Kazmi|first=SMA|title=Roopkund's skeletal tales|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090205/dplus1.htm|accessdate=30 May 2013|newspaper=The Tribune|date=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
[[File:Bedni Bugal on way to roopkund.jpg|thumb|Trekking path to Roopkund, passing near [[Bedni Bugyal]]]]
Roopkund is a picturesque tourist destination and one of the important places for trekking in [[Chamoli District]], Himalayas, near the base of two Himalayan peaks: [[Trisul]] (7,120&amp;nbsp;m) and [[Nanda Ghunti]] (6,310&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref name=important&gt;{{cite book|last=Nigam|first=Devesh|title=Tourism, environment and development of Garhwal Himalaya|year=2002|publisher=Mittal Publ.|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788170998709|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MK1nAp5hTWsC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=Roopkund&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TBCmUb5diMqsB_3HgcAN&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Roopkund&amp;f=false|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lake is flanked by a rock face named Junargali to the North and a peak named Chandania Kot to the East.

Roopkund's skeletons were featured in a ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'' documentary, "Riddles Of The Dead: Skeleton Lake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miditech.tv/content.aspx?page=skeleton_lake |title=Skeleton Lake |publisher=Miditech.tv |accessdate=2012-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206152124/http://www.miditech.tv/content.aspx?page=skeleton_lake |archivedate=6 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://natgeotv.com/asia/riddles-of-the-dead/about Riddles of the Dead Episode Guide], [[National Geographic Channel]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5186">'''Ṣalāt al-Janāzah''' ({{lang-ar|صلاة الجنازة}}) is the Islamic [[funeral]] [[prayer]]; a part of the [[Islamic funeral]] ritual. The prayer is performed in congregation to seek pardon for the deceased and all dead [[Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=JlqJAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=salat+janazah&amp;dq=salat+janazah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix1MSsyLfaAhXpKJoKHWuoABoQ6AEILzAC|title=The History and Message of Islam|first=John Paul C.|last=Nzomiwu|date=13 April 1989|publisher=Meks-Unique|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Salat al-Janazah is a collective obligation upon Muslims (''[[fard|farḍ]] al-kifāya'') i.e., if some Muslims take the responsibility of doing it, the obligation is fulfilled, but if no-one fulfils it, then all Muslims will be accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=CDpzAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT56&amp;dq=salat+janazah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix1MSsyLfaAhXpKJoKHWuoABoQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=salat+janazah&amp;f=false|title=A Guide to Salat (Prayer) in Islam|first=Muhammad Abdul Karim|last=Saqib|date=13 April 2015|publisher=Salaam - Salah Vision|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performing the funeral prayer when the body is not present is generally not permitted in the [[Hanafi]] and [[Maliki]] ''[[madhhab]]''s, is permitted in the [[Hanbali]] ''madhhab'', and is recommended in the [[Shafi‘i]] ''madhhab''.

==Description==
{{manual|section|date=August 2017}}
It is preferable that those praying divide themselves into odd rows with one person as an [[imam]] standing alone in front and while facing the [[qiblah]]. The body is placed in front of the Imam. If there is more than one body, then these should be put one in front of the other.  The spoken part of the prayer involves quietly reciting sura ''[[Al-Fatiha]]'', then praying for God to bestow peace, mercy and blessings on [[Muhammad]], and finally saying two ''[[du'a]]s''. There is no [[ruku]] in janazah prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sheikh Ramzy|title=The Complete Guide to Islamic Prayer (Salāh)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cL7jN5uWzhMC&amp;pg=RA2-PT143|year=2012|publisher=Author House|isbn=978-1-4772-1465-7|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad and his companions explained how the salah should be:&lt;ref&gt;Kitaab Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz, vol 13, p.&amp;nbsp;141&lt;/ref&gt;

# Having the appropriate ''neeyat'' (intention) in your heart, You say the first [[takbir]] while raising your hands, then you fold and hold your hands on your chest in the usual manner, the right hand on the left, then you seek refuge with Allah from the accursed [[Shaitan|Shayṭan]], then you utter ''[[Basmala|Bismillah]]'' and recite ''Al-Fatiha''
# Then you say Takbir and ''[[Salawat#Durood-i-Ibrahimi|Durood-i Ibrahimi]].''
# Then you say a third Takbir and make [[du'a]] for the deceased.

{{quote|It is narrated that Muhammad said: 

"O God, forgive our living and our dead, those who are present among us and those who are absent, our young and our old, our males and our females. O God, whoever You keep alive, keep him alive in Islam, and whoever You cause to die, cause him to die with faith. O God, do not deprive us of the reward and do not cause us to go astray after this. O God, forgive him and have mercy on him, keep him safe and sound and forgive him, honor his rest and ease his entrance; wash him with water and snow and hail, and cleanse him of sin as a white garment is cleansed of dirt. O God, give him a home better than his home and a family better than his family. O God, admit him to Paradise and protect him from the torment of the grave and the torment of Hell-fire; make his grave spacious and fill it with light."

:It is acceptable for other words to be used for ''du'a''; for example, one could say: 

O God, if he was a doer of good, then increase his good deeds, and if he was a wrongdoer, then overlook his bad deeds. O God, forgive him and give him the steadiness to say the right thing.}}

4. Then a fourth takbir is recited, followed by a short pause, then a final ''[[taslim]]'' to the right, saying "''Assalaamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah''" ("Peace and blessings of God be unto you").

== Exceptions ==
According to an authentic [[hadith]], Muhammad did not say the burial prayers of a person who committed suicide;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmje.usc.edu/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/004-smt.php#004.2133|title=Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement|website=cmje.usc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Jabir b. Samura reported: [The dead body] of a person who had killed himself with a broad-headed arrow was brought before the Apostle of Allah, but he did not offer prayers for him.

Another exception is for one who hasn't paid off debts until someone paid it on the deceased person's behalf. | {{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|004|2133}}}}

[[File:If You Talk Too Much This Man May Die mirror.jpg|thumb|upright|An appeal to self-interest during [[World War II]].]]
'''Self-interest''' generally refers to a focus on the needs or desires (''interests'') of the [[self]]. A number of [[philosophy|philosophical]], [[psychology|psychological]], and [[economy|economic]] theories examine the role of self-interest in motivating human action.

==In philosophy==&lt;!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER --&gt;
Philosophical concepts concerned with self-interest include:
*[[Enlightened self-interest]], a philosophy which states that acting to further the interests of others also serves one's own self-interest.
*[[Ethical egoism]], the ethical position that moral agents ''ought'' to do what is in their own self-interest.
*[[Hedonism]], the school of ethics which argues that pleasure is the only intrinsic good.
**[[Epicureanism]], a philosophical system related to hedonism.
*[[Individualism]], a philosophy stressing the worth of individual selves.
*[[Rational egoism]], the position that all rational actions are those done in one's self-interest.

==In psychology==
Psychological concepts concerned with self-interest include [[psychological egoism]], the view that humans are always motivated by self-interest and [[narcissism]], which is an unhealthy self-absorption due to a disturbance in the sense of self.

==In biology==
In [[Richard Dawkins]]' book [[The Selfish Gene]], self-interest was considered a major artifact in evolution, a necessary process for living organisms.

'''Steven Hayden Pollock''' was a [[mycologist]] who studied [[psychoactive mushrooms]] and published many articles on the potential of mushrooms to treat illness and improve quality of life.&lt;ref name="LibertyCapsPsychotherapeuticPotential"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollock|first1=Steven Hayden|title=Liberty Caps: recreational hallucinogenic mushrooms|journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence|date=October 1976|volume=1|issue=6|pages=445–447|doi=10.1016/0376-8716(76)90010-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PsilocybinMushroomPandemic"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollock|first1=Steven Hayden|title=The Psilocybin Mushroom Pandemic|journal=Journal of Psychedelic Drugs|date=17 January 2012|volume=7|issue=1|pages=73–84|doi=10.1080/02791072.1975.10472640}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|81}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollock|first1=Steven Hayden|title=Psilocybian Mycetismus With Special Reference To Panaeolus|journal=Journal of Psychedelic Drugs|date=17 January 2012|volume=8|issue=1|pages=43–57|doi=10.1080/02791072.1976.10472007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|55}}

==Life and career==
Pollock and Gary Lincoff found an entirely new species, and named it ''[[Psilocybe tampanensis]]'', in [[Tampa, FL]], September 3, 1977 while the Second International Mycological Congress was happening, Pollock was so excited he said they discovered the [[philosopher’s stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Steven Hayden Pollock|author2=Gastón Guzmán|author-link2=Gastón Guzmán|title=A new bluing species of Psilocybe from Florida, U.S.A.|journal=Mycotaxon|date=July–September 1978|volume=7|issue=2|pages=373–376|url=http://www.mykoweb.com/systematics/journals/Mycotaxon/Mycotaxon%20v007n2.pdf|accessdate=2 June 2017|language=en|issn=0093-4666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harpersBloodSpore" /&gt;{{rp|3–4}}

He wrote the Magic Mushroom Cultivation book in 1977, it contained his research on several ways to cultivate magic mushrooms,&lt;ref name="MagicMushroomCultivation"&gt;{{cite book|last1=H. Pollock|first1=Steven|title=Magic Mushroom Cultivation|date=1977|publisher=Herbal Medicine Research Foundation|location=San Antonio|isbn=9780930074012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the cultivation in brown rice that was later demonstrated to produce mushrooms of high [[psilocybin]] content.&lt;ref name="harpersBloodSpore" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

Pollock isolated a strain of ''P. tampanensis'' that produced [[sclerotia]] of a size much bigger than known before. This discovery enabled a means of using psilocybin in places where magic mushrooms are illegal, such as after the magic mushroom ban in Amsterdam on December 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Truffle takes over from the magic mushroom|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2011/12/truffle_takes_over_from_the_ma/|accessdate=3 June 2017|work=DutchNews.nl|date=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amsterdam tourists mad about truffle trips|url=https://www.rnw.org/archive/amsterdam-tourists-mad-about-truffle-trips|website=RNW Media|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harpersBloodSpore" /&gt;{{rp|6,16}}

Pollock envisioned creating the first legal medical mushroom research laboratory and estimated he would need about 2 million dollars to set it up.&lt;ref name="harpersBloodSpore" /&gt;{{rp|6–8}} Together with another mushroom lover, Michael Forbes, they founded a company called Hidden Creek in 1979 to sell ''P. tampanensis'' [[sclerotium]] by mail; they advertised in the monthly magazine [[High Times]], and became the largest magic mushroom vendor in the world within the same year.&lt;ref name="harpersBloodSpore" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

He sold mushrooms, prescriptions, and planted an acre of [[cannabis]] to get the funds he needed to his research. He traveled to the Amazon and Mexico to study psychoactive mushrooms and discovered 3 species in 1979: ''[[Psilocybe armandii]]'', ''[[Psilocybe wassoniorum]]'', and ''[[Psilocybe schultesii]]''.&lt;ref name="harpersBloodSpore" /&gt;{{rp|7–8}} In 1980, because of his high volume of illegal prescription writing, the state pharmacy board alerted employees about his practice. As a work-around Pollock bought his own pharmacy to supply his customers.&lt;ref name="harpersBloodSpore" /&gt;{{rp|8}}

==Death==
Pollock worked 7 days a week; on a Saturday at 7 PM he arranged with his girlfriend Mitzi by phone to meet for dinner, but he had a last patient scheduled to come that night. Mitzi called him several times through the night, but he did not answer. Worried, she ran to his office at 11 PM and found the house ransacked. Pollock was in the corner beside the front door, shot dead in the forehead.

The police found 1,753 jars of growing psychoactive mushrooms in his greenhouse that were dumped and burned by San Antonio Narcotics Force.&lt;ref name="harpersBloodSpore" /&gt;{{rp|10–12}} Gary Davis, Pollock's friend, got a tape of two people talking about Pollock's murder, but kept it in the fear someone would kill him.&lt;ref name="harpersBloodSpore" /&gt;{{rp|13}}

In 1983, detective Anton Michalec found three suspects, Ernest Dietzmann and Jerry Baker that were drug dependents and patients of Pollock's, and Arthur Lenz, a [[methamphetamine]] dealer. They intended to rob Pollock of his money, and their fingerprints matched those found at the crime scene. Michalec brought the case to the district attorney Terry McDonald, who refused to prosecute for unknown reasons, and Michalec's work was forgotten. All three suspects died free men.

In 2013, when journalist [[Hamilton Morris]] contacted McDonald, who explained he actually wasn't the district attorney at that time, Morris tried to investigate and was informed by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] that they had destroyed and lost the records and information about who was responsible for the case.&lt;ref name="harpersBloodSpore" /&gt;{{rp|14}}

In [[English law]], '''unlawful killing''' is a verdict that can be returned by an [[inquest (England and Wales)|inquest]] in [[England and Wales]] when someone has been killed by one or several unknown persons. The verdict means that the killing was done without lawful excuse and in breach of [[criminal law]]. This includes [[murder]], [[manslaughter]], [[infanticide]] and causing [[death by dangerous driving]].  A verdict of unlawful killing generally leads to a police investigation, with the aim of gathering sufficient evidence to identify, [[Criminal charge|charge]] and [[prosecute]] those responsible.

The inquest does not normally name any individual person as responsible.&lt;ref name="halsbury"&gt;Lord Mackay of Clashfern (ed.) (2006) ''Halsbury's Laws of England'', 4th ed. reissue, vol.9(2), "Coroners", '''1043. Killed unlawfully'''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Legal burden of proof|standard of proof]] is that the unlawful killing must be beyond reasonable doubt. If this standard is not met, a verdict of [[accidental death]] or [[death by misadventure]] on the balance of probabilities may be returned.&lt;ref name="halsbury"/&gt;

==Notable cases==
A verdict of unlawful killing was returned in the following notable cases:
*Lt Col [[Rupert Thorneloe]] and Trooper Joshua Hammond, of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, were killed in an explosion in Helmand Province in Afghanistan on 1 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Steven|title=Rupert Thorneloe was unlawfully killed in Afghanistan, inquest finds|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/apr/30/rupert-thorneloe-death-afghanistan-inquest|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=The Guardian|date=30 April 2010|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ian Tomlinson]], who was struck with a baton and pushed to the ground by Metropolitan Police officer Simon Harwood at the G20 protests in London on 1 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/may/03/ian-tomlinson-unlawfully-killed-inquest|newspaper=The Guardian|title=Ian Tomlinson unlawfully killed, inquest finds|date=3 May 2011|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] and [[Dodi Al-Fayed]], killed in a car crash on 6 September 1997. A verdict of unlawful killing was returned in a 2008 inquest in London; the [[Diana, Princess of Wales#Conspiracy theories, inquest and verdict|initial French enquiry]] in 1999 concluded the crash was caused by the driver's loss of control while drunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Princess Diana unlawfully killed|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7328754.stm|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=BBC|date=7 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Victory Arch''' ({{lang-ar|قوس النصر}} ''Qaws an-Naṣr''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://aawsat.com/details.asp?section=4&amp;issueno=11759&amp;article=607155&amp;feature=جهود للحفاظ على قوس النصر في بغداد بعد تدمير أنصاب وتماثيل أقامها صدام], جريدة الشرق الأوسط&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baghdad.gov.iq/ar/index.php/2009-10-24-07-37-29/content-layouts.html معالم بغداد] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317122308/http://www.baghdad.gov.iq/ar/index.php/2009-10-24-07-37-29/content-layouts.html |date=2011-03-17 }}، الموقع الرسمي لـمحافظة بغداد&lt;/ref&gt; officially known as the ''Swords of Qādisīyah''، and popularly called the ''Hands of Victory'' or the ''Crossed Swords'', are a pair of [[triumphal arch]]es in central [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]]. Each arch consists of a pair of outstretched hands holding crossed swords. The two arches mark the two entrances to [[Grand Festivities Square]] and the parade ground constructed to commemorate the [[Iran–Iraq War]], led by then Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]]. The arches were opened to the public on 8 August, 1989. It is one of [[Baghdad#Main sights|Baghdad's visitor attractions]] and near to ''[[The Monument to the Unknown Soldier]]''.

==Location==
The two sets of arches mark the entrances to an area known as Zawra Park. In 1986 (two years before the war's end) the government of Iraq began the construction of a festival and parade ground in Zawra Park, near the extensive presidential complex in the center of Baghdad. Known as ''[[Grand Festivities Square]]'', it comprised a large parade ground, an extensive review pavilion and a large reflecting pool. The surrounding grassy areas hosted Iraqis during military parades. Adding to the festive appeal of the grounds were three refreshments booths that sold ice cream, cold beverages, and candy.

This site would become the area where three monuments would be constructed to remember Iraq's pain and suffering as a consequence of the eight-year war. The Victory Arch was the last of the three structures to be built, and it followed on from the construction of the ''Monument to the Unknown Soldier,'' (1982) and ''[[Al-Shaheed Monument]]'' (1983). The three monuments form a unit.&lt;ref&gt;Makiya, K. and Al-Khalilm S., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Saddam Hussein's Iraq,''  p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The official name of the arches, the ''Swords of Qādisiyyah'', is an allusion to the historical [[Battle of al-Qādisiyyah]], when Arab armies defeated Sassanid Iran (Persia) in the 7th-century, and captured their capital, [[Ctesiphon|Ctesiphone]] where an [[Taq Kasra|arch]] marks the entrance to the ancient Imperial Palace. Zawra Park was home to the Museum of Gifts to the President and a performing arts center. The museum was located on the ground floor of the grand reviewing pavilion where Saddam was known to review the Republican Guard while firing a weapon in the air. The museum contained ordinary items donated by Iraqis during his rule. Items included cheap plastic ornaments and drawings donated by Iraqi children.

==History==
Iraq's leading [[sculpture|sculptor]], [[Khaled al-Rahal]], won the commission to design and execute the construction of the arches, which were based on a concept sketch made by president Saddam Hussein. The design consists of a pair of massive hands emerging from the ground, each holding a {{convert|43|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} sword. However, al-Rahal died in 1987, before the monument was completed, and another eminent Iraqi sculptor, [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]], assumed control of the project. &lt;ref&gt;Makiya, K. (Al-Khalilm S.), ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Saddam Hussein's Iraq,''  pp 1-2; Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S. (eds), ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,''  Oxford University Press, 2009; Miles, M., Borden, I. and Hall, R., ''The City Cultures Reader,''Psychology Press, 2000, p. 104; Svasek, M., ''The Anthropology Art and Cultural Production: Histories, Themes, Perspectives,'' Pluto Press, 2007, p. 74; Weschler, L., ''Calamities of Exile: Three Nonfiction Novellas,'' University of Chicago Press, 1998,  p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Both sculptors worked in close collaboration with Saddam Hussein.&lt;ref&gt;Marozzi, J., ''Baghdad: City of Peace, City of Blood,'' Penguin UK, 2014, p. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument was built as part of a broader program to beautify the city of Baghdad and to create public works that would help to instil a sense of national pride within the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| isbn=0-520-07376-2| authorlink=Kanan Makiya| first=Kanan| last=Makiya| title=Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq | location=Berkeley| publisher= University of California Press| year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baghdad is now dotted with monuments, including [[Al-Shaheed Monument]] and Monument to an Unknown Soldier, and many other statues, fountains and sculptures; all constructed between 1969 and 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B.A. and Feldman, M.H. (eds), ''Critical Approaches to Ancient Near Eastern Art,''Walter de Gruyter, 2014 p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

The site selected for the monument was where the Muslim Arabs defeated the [[Persia]]ns in 636 CE and is generally seen to be the beginning of Islamic domination of the region.  On the day the monument was dedicated in 1990, Saddam rode under the arches astride a white horse. It has been suggested that this was an allusion to the slain Shiite martyr [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]], killed in [[Karbala]] in [[Anno Domini|AD]] 680, whose death caused the rift between Shiite and Sunni Muslims. The monument, although presenting a triumphalist narrative in relation to the Iran-Iraq war, has assumed a broader symbolism and represents those Iraqis who fell in any war throughout the country's history.&lt;ref&gt;Makiya, K. (Al-Khalilm S.), ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,''  pp 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Victory Arch 2004 - 1.JPG|thumb|left|''Victory Arch'' (detail) The giant hands appear to be bursting from the ground, with helmets of fallen soldiers scattered on the ground.]]
The monument consists of a pair of outstretched arms which appear to be exploding out of the ground, each holding a sword which meet at a central point. The swords, which are made of stainless steel, are based on the weapons carried by [[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas]], the Arab leader at the Battle of [[Al-Qādisiyyah (historical city)|Qadisiya]] (from where the monument derives its Arabic name).&lt;ref&gt;Davis, E., "The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq," [Book Review], ''Middle East Journal,'' (Washington), Vol. 46, No. 1, 1992, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; A small flagpole rises from the point where the swords meet,  about {{convert|130|ft|m|order=flip}} above the ground. Al-Rahal used photographs and plaster casts of Saddam's forearms as a model for the design of the hands. Toward the end of the project, after Ghani had taken over, the sulptor personally took an impression of one of Saddam's thumbs, and the resulting fingerprint was added to the mold for one of the arches' thumbs. At the time, Iraq did not have a foundry sufficiently large to cast the sculpture, leading to much of it being made abroad. The arches were made by an international consortium led by the [[Germany|German]] foundry H+H Metallform. The blades of the stainless steel swords weigh 24 tons each. Cast in Iraq, they are partly composed of metal from guns and tanks of Iraqi soldiers killed in the Iran-Iraq war. The hands and arms of the monument are of bronze, cast in the [[United Kingdom]] at the [[Morris Singer]] [[Foundry]]. The arms rest on concrete [[plinth]]s, the form of which make the arms appear to burst up out of the ground. Each plinth holds 2,500 [[helmet]]s (a total of 5,000 helmets) which, Saddam claimed, belonged to Iranian soldiers killed during the war; they are held in nets which allow them to spill onto the ground beneath.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,''  pp 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Physical specifications===

The monument has a number of elements, each made from different construction materials:&lt;ref&gt;Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,''  p.2&lt;/ref&gt; 
; The Exploding ground
: Constructed of reinforced concrete, with enemy helmets scattered around
; Forearm and grip  
:Cast in bronze, each weighing 20 tons, fixed with a reinforced frame, also 20 tons
; Swords 
: The swords have a slight curve, allowing them to meet in the middle, giving the arched shape. They are cast in stainless steel and each sword weighs 24 tons. 
; The Net
: The net was cast in bronze and each contains 2,500 enemy helmets
;The Flag Pole
: The flag and pole were made of stainless steel and rise 7 metres above the point where the arched swords meet

The monument has been described as "kitch, totalitarian art."&lt;ref&gt;Makiya, K., "What Is Totalitarian Art? Cultural Kitsch From Stalin to Saddam," [Review of ''Totalitarian Art: In the Soviet Union, the Third Reich, Fascist Italy, and the People's Republic of China,'' in ''Foreign Affairs,'' Vol. 90, No. 3, 2011, pp. 142-148,  https://www.jstor.org/stable/23039415&lt;/ref&gt; It was restored in 2011.

==Recent developments==
The monument was not destroyed during the 1991 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], though [[General]] [[Norman Schwarzkopf]] wanted to remove it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/baghdad-monuments.htm# |title=Baghdad Monuments&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2003-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225151850/https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/baghdad-monuments.htm# |archive-date=2017-12-25 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arches remain standing in what is now the [[International Zone]] of Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1239873,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Fate of Saddam relics sparks debate | first=Brian | last=Whitaker | date=June 16, 2004 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, it was reported that the new Iraqi government had organized the Committee for Removing Symbols of the Saddam Era and that the Arc of Triumph monument had begun to be dismantled, which drew protests from Iraqi and preservationist groups.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael S. |last=Schmidt |title=Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, Iraqi Sculptor, Dies at 82 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/arts/design/mohammed-ghani-hikmat-iraqi-sculptor-dies-at-82.html |work=[[New York Times]] |publisher= |date=2011-09-21 |accessdate=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925060617/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/arts/design/mohammed-ghani-hikmat-iraqi-sculptor-dies-at-82.html# |archive-date=2011-09-25 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demolition began on Tuesday, February 20, 2007.  At that time, {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on|order=flip|0}} chunks had been cut out of the bronze monument. Numerous Iraqi bystanders and coalition troops were seen taking helmets and bits of the monument away as souvenirs. The decision to remove the monument, made by Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]], was challenged by U.S. Ambassador [[Zalmay Khalilzad]], who blocked the demolition on February 21. The government of Iraq reversed its earlier plans to demolish the monument.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, K., “Iraq Confronts Hussein Legacy Cast in Bronze,” ''New York Times,'' 7 April, 2007, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/08/world/middleeast/08monuments.html Online:] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180529133519/https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/08/world/middleeast/08monuments.html# |date=2018-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Victory arch is one of Baghdad's most photographed monuments. Visitors who stand in a specific location can be photographed as if their own hands are holding the swords. The hands, which are hollow, present visitors with another photo opportunity- many troops and other coalition visitors have climbed up inside them to look out from the point at which the swords meet the hands, generally to have souvenir pictures taken.  

The monument also featured on the 100 [[Iraqi dinar|dinar]] banknote for 1991 (pictured).

[[File:Sikorski in Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|right|Sikorski atop the Rock of Gibraltar, surveying the fortifications.]]

'''Władysław Sikorski's death controversy''' revolves around the death of the commander-in-chief of the [[Polish Army]] and [[Prime Minister]] of the [[Polish government in exile]], General [[Władysław Sikorski]], in the [[1943 B-24 crash in Gibraltar]]. Sikorski's [[B-24 Liberator|Liberator II]] crashed off Gibraltar almost immediately after take off, with the plane's pilot being the only survivor. The catastrophe, while officially classified as an accident, has led to several [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] that persist to this day, and often propose that the crash was an assassination, which has variously been blamed on the Soviets, British, Nazis or even a dissenting Polish faction. The incident is still described by some historians as mysterious, and since 2008 it has been under an investigation by the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]], ongoing {{as of|2013|July|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="ipn"/&gt;{{update inline|date=July 2018}}

==Death of Sikorski==
{{main|1943 Gibraltar B-24 crash}}
[[File:SikorskiPlane 1943.jpg|thumb|Sikorski's [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Liberator]], lying on its back in the sea just off [[Gibraltar]] following the crash]]
[[File:General Sikorski's funeral in Gibraltar (cropped).jpg|thumb|Sikorski's body being carried onto a ship at the Gibraltar Naval Base after his funeral]]
In late May 1943, Sikorski  went to inspect [[Polish Army in the West|Polish forces]] stationed in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="psb475"/&gt; He was inspecting the forces and raising morale of the Polish troops there. He was also occupied with political matters; around that time, a conflict was growing between him and general [[Władysław Anders]]. The main reason for this was that Sikorski was still open to some normalization of [[Polish-Soviet relations]], to which Anders vehemently objected.&lt;ref name="psb475"/&gt;

On 4 July 1943, while returning from the Middle East, Sikorski perished, together with his daughter, his [[Chief of staff (politics)|Chief of Staff]], [[Tadeusz Klimecki]], and seven others, when his aircraft, a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Consolidated Liberator II]], [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial number]] ''AL523'', crashed into the sea 16&amp;nbsp;seconds after takeoff from [[Gibraltar Airport]] at 23:07&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name="psb475"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kisielewski2005-169"/&gt;

==Investigation and controversy==
[[File:Memorial of General Wladyslaw in Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque dedicated to Sikorski located at the end of the [[Great Siege Tunnels]] in Gibraltar. The plaque notes that "the cause of this mysterious accident has never been ascertained; a fact which has given rise to many speculations, doubts and rumours."]]A British Court of Inquiry convened on July 7 that year investigated the crash of Sikorski's [[B-24 Liberator|Liberator II]] serial ''AL 523'', but was unable to determine the cause, finding only that it was an accident and "due to jamming of elevator controls", noting that "it has not been possible to determine how the jamming occurred but it has been established that there was no sabotage."&lt;ref name="Peszke2005-102"/&gt; The Polish government refused to endorse the report, due to the contradiction about the cause not being determined but sabotage being ruled out, and pursued its own investigation, which suggested that the cause of the accident cannot be easily determined.&lt;ref name="Peszke2005-103"/&gt; The political context of the event, coupled with a variety of circumstances, immediately gave rise to numerous speculation that Sikorski's death had been no accident, and may have been the direct result of a German, Soviet, British, or even Polish [[Cabal|conspiracy]].&lt;ref name="psb475"/&gt;&lt;ref name="polityka"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanczyk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnett2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AtkinBiddiss2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies2008"/&gt;

Some of the earliest suggestions of a conspiracy were popularized by [[Nazi propaganda]], which suggested that Sikorski's death was the result of a British-Soviet conspiracy.&lt;ref name=polityka/&gt; Some modern sources still note that the accident is not fully explained; for example [[Jerzy Jan Lerski]] in his ''Historical Dictionary of Poland'' (1996), entry on the "Gibraltar, Catastrophe of", notes that "there are several theories explaining the event, but the mystery was never fully solved."&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt; As [[Roman Wapiński]] noted in his biographical entry on Sikorski in the [[Polish Biographical Dictionary]] in 1997, no conclusive evidence of any wrongdoing has been found, and Sikorski's death is officially classified as an accident.&lt;ref name="psb475"/&gt; The unresolved questions surrounding his death have led to a number of publications, in historical and mainstream press, in Poland and abroad.&lt;ref name=polityka/&gt; Commenting on them in 2009, Polish historian [[Andrzej Garlicki]], building on a similar argument by historian [[Marian Kukiel]], stated that all conspiracy theories about Sikorski's deaths are irresponsible fiction.&lt;ref name=polityka/&gt;

In 2008, the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]] (IPN) began an official inquiry into the incident.&lt;ref name="ipn"/&gt; Sikorski was exhumed and his remains were examined by Polish scientists, who in 2009 concluded that he died due to injuries consistent with an air crash, and that there was no evidence that Sikorski was murdered, ruling out theories that he was shot or strangled before the incident; however they did not rule out the possibility of [[sabotage]], which is still being investigated by the Institute of National Remembrance.&lt;ref name="tvn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gazeta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Probe into Poland WWII PM death"/&gt; The investigation was ongoing {{as of|2013|July|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=gazkrak&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazetakrakowska.pl/artykul/936404,sledztwo-ipn-nie-rozwiklalo-zagadki-smierci-gen-sikorskiego,id,t.html?cookie=1 |title=Śledztwo IPN nie rozwikłało zagadki śmierci gen. Sikorskiego |publisher=Gazetakrakowska.pl |date=2013-07-04 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the IPN historians, [[Maciej Korkuć]], has stated that "many facts suggest an assassination", although another, [[Andrzej Chwalba]], notes that there is insufficient evidence to support this claim.&lt;ref name=gazkrak/&gt; He also complains that some British and Spanish documents still remain classified, hindering the investigation.&lt;ref name=gazkrak/&gt;

The British documents concerning the accident will not be uncovered until 2050; before that date, they will remain top secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Poznać przeszłość: Wiek XX: Podręcznik do historii dla szkół ponadgimnazjalnych. Zakres podstawowy|last=Roszak|first=Stanisław|last2=Kłaczkow|first2=Jarosław|publisher=Nowa Era|year=2015|isbn=9788326724022|location=Warsaw|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative explanations and conspiracy theories==
Since the day of the accident, there was uncertainty about who boarded the plane and about the exact cargo manifest—all leading to uncertainty as to the identity of the bodies recovered from the crash site; some bodies, including that of Sikorski's daughter, Zofia, were never recovered.&lt;ref name="Wprost-Z"/&gt; Since several bodies were never found and the bodies of several members of Sikorski's entourage were never positively identified, some conspiracy theorists such as journalist and amateur historian [[Dariusz Baliszewski]] postulate that some might have been murdered on the ground&lt;ref name=TH&gt;{{cite web|author=Dariusz&amp;nbsp;Baliszewski |url=http://www.wprost.pl/ar/72691/Tajemnica-Hieny/ |title=Tajemnica Hieny – WPROST |publisher=Wprost.pl |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others might have been abducted to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Wprost-Z"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kisielewski2005-225226241243"/&gt;

Baliszewski and [[Tadeusz Kisielewski]] are among those who point out the opportunity the Soviets had at Gibraltar.&lt;ref name=TH/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kisielewski2005-225226241243"/&gt; At about the same time that Sikorski's plane was left unguarded at the Gibraltar airfield, a Soviet plane was parked nearby; it carried Soviet ambassador [[Ivan Maisky]], giving the Soviets an officially confirmed presence at the site of the accident.&lt;ref name="Biuletyn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mawgan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraphph/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc290109"/&gt; The head of the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]]'s [[counterintelligence]] for the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from 1941 to 1944 was [[Kim Philby]], the Soviet [[double agent]] who would defect in 1963 and later claim to have been a double agent since the 1940s. Before 1941, Philby had served as an instructor with the [[Special Operations Executive]], an organization specializing in sabotage and diversion behind enemy lines.&lt;ref name="Mawgan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraphph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wprost-K"/&gt;

Among the rumoured kidnap victims a prominent role is given to Sikorski's daughter, [[Zofia Leśniowska]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rp.pl/artykul/888189.html?p=2 |title=Kto porwał córkę Sikorskiego &amp;#124; rp.pl &amp;#124; strona 3 |publisher=rp.pl |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was reported in 1945 to have been spotted in a Soviet [[Gulag]] by a member of the elite Polish commandos ([[Cichociemni]]), [[Tadeusz Kobyliński]].&lt;ref name="Wprost-Z"/&gt; Kobyliński attempted in 1945 or 1946 to gather [[Armia Krajowa]] personnel for a mission to rescue Leśniowska.

Another controversy surrounds the sole survivor of the flight, a Czech officer, [[Eduard Prchal]].&lt;ref name=polityka/&gt; Prchal, like many pilots who did not wish to tempt fate was known for never wearing his [[Personal flotation device#Mae West|Mae West life jacket]] — but on this occasion, when rescued from the sea, he was wearing one.&lt;ref name="Wprost-K"/&gt; During the inquiry he denied this, and later blamed the inconsistency on post-crash shock affecting his actions and memory – essentially, on [[amnesia]].&lt;ref name="Wprost-K"/&gt; Later he explained that he must have instinctively put the vest on when he realised the plane was in trouble.&lt;ref name="Wprost-K"/&gt; Polish aviation expert [[Jerzy Maryniak]] created a simulation of the crash, in which he concluded that the plane must have been under control up until the very moment of the crash.&lt;ref name="Kisielewski2005-5065"/&gt; Kisielewski argues that the plane was likely under the control of the second pilot, who died in the crash.&lt;ref name="Kisielewski2005-169"/&gt;

Other conspiracy theories point to the British, the German [[Abwehr]] intelligence agency or the Poles themselves, some of whom (especially under the command of General Anders) had shown animosity toward Sikorski for, at least from their point of view, his policy of "colluding" with Soviet Premier [[Joseph Stalin]], which reached new heights by the Germans' April 1943 discovery of mass graves filled with thousands of Polish prisoners of war murdered by the Soviets at [[Katyn massacre|Katyn Forest]] in 1940.&lt;ref name="Stanczyk"/&gt; Most notably though, in 1967 the [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] [[David Irving]] published a book dedicated to this incident, and suggesting British complicity in the incident.&lt;ref name="na"/&gt;

In his book ''Disasters in the Air'', former KLM pilot and one-time IFALPA president Jan Bartelski, of Polish origin, suggests that the crash of the Liberator that carried Gen. Sikorski was caused by a half-empty mail bag jammed between the horizontal stabilizer and the elevator, thus "freezing" the controls and preventing F/Lt Prchal from gaining altitude after takeoff. The mail bag was in the cargo compartment and was blown out of the aircraft through the side hatch (which in normally configured Liberators would have served to protect the machine gun position) by a strong airflow rushing through the nose gear door.&lt;ref name="mysterious"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
The crash of Sikorski's Liberator is portrayed in the 1958 film ''[[The Silent Enemy (film)|The Silent Enemy]]'', in which the team of Royal Navy divers charged with retrieving Sikorski's briefcase from the wrecked aircraft is led by [[Lionel Crabb|Lionel "Buster" Crabb]], himself later to disappear in 1956 in mysterious circumstances while diving in the vicinity of a visiting [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] warship.&lt;ref name="Sydney Knowles"/&gt;

In 1968, the play ''[[Soldiers (play)|Soldaten. Nekrolog auf Genf]]'' (''Soldiers, An obituary for Geneva'') by German writer [[Rolf Hochhuth]] debuted in London. The play partially drew on the work of [[David Irving]] and contained the sensational allegation that Winston Churchill had been in on the plot.&lt;ref name="psb475"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; In Hochhuth's play, Sikorski and other passengers were murdered by axe-wielding British commandos.&lt;ref name=polityka/&gt; Hochhuth, unaware that the plane's pilot [[Eduard Prchal]] was still alive, accused him of participating in the plot. Prchal won a libel case that seriously affected the London theatre which staged the play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstthings.com/article/2004/04/001-the-end-of-the-pius-wars "''The End of the Pius Wars''"], [[Joseph Bottum (author)|Joseph Bottum]], [[First Things]] Magazine, April 2004, retrieved 1 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Hochhuth never paid the 50,000 British pounds imposed on him by the court and subsequently avoided returning to the UK.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/2016/29/rolf-hochhuth-stoerenfried-sachbuch-birgit-lahann|title=Rolf Hochhuth: Immobilien-Wessi|last=Naumann|first=Michael|date=2016-07-23|work=|newspaper=[[Die Zeit]]|language=German|author-link=Michael Naumann|access-date=2016-07-24|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he revealed his source for Churchill's involvement as Jane Ledig-Rowohlt, the British wife of his publisher [[Heinrich Maria Ledig-Rowohlt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moz.de/artikel-ansicht/dg/0/1/293866|title=Hochhuth benennt Zeugen für Mord an Sikorski|last=|first=|date=2011-04-28|website=|publisher=Märkische Oderzeitung / dpa|language=German|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (née Jane Scatcherd). According to Hochhuth's biographer Birgit Lahann, these rumours relayed by Jane Ledig-Rowohlt had been the sole source for the allegations in the play.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2009 a Polish film, ''[[Generał. Zamach na Gibraltarze]]'' was filmed, focusing on a plot to assassinate Sikorski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmweb.pl/film/Genera%C5%82+-+zamach+na+Gibraltarze-2009-471945 |title=Generał – zamach na Gibraltarze (2009) – Filmweb |language=pl |publisher=Filmweb.pl |date= |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zero world government''' refers to a hypothetical future in which [[central government|national governments]] cease to exist or to matter, as a result of [[globalization]] and a worldwide rejection of politics, as known today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The term contrasts with that of one [[world government]] in the sense that rather than there being a world-[[state (polity)|state]], there are no political states in the world.
