[[File:ASV02.svg|right|100 px]]
The '''Armeesportvereinigung Vorwärts''' (Army Sports Club Forward), briefly ''' ASV Vorwärts ''', was the sport organization of the [[German Democratic Republic]]'s [[National People's Army]] (NVA) and its predecessor, the Barracked People's Police (''Kasernierte Volkspolizei'').

Together with the sport clubs and the [[Sportvereinigung Dynamo]], the ASV was one of the most important supports of the GDR's achievement sport system.
From their clubs in [[Potsdam]], [[Frankfurt (Oder)]], [[Neubrandenburg]], [[Stralsund]] or [[Rostock]] emerged well-known sportsmen like the boxer [[Henry Maske]] or the canoeist [[Birgit Fischer]].

In almost every city with barracks or other army installations the ASV kept a training center. Apart from providing the training equipment, the most important task of the local sections was the promotion of youth sports.

The uniform ASV tracksuit, brown [[polyamide]] with yellow and red stripes on the arms and the oval ''ASV'' [[emblem]] on the left chest, attained very popular cult status amongst youth after the [[German reunification]].

'''Boxgrove''' is a [[village]] and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[Chichester (district)|Chichester District]] of the [[England|English]] county of [[West Sussex]], about five kilometres (3.5&amp;nbsp;miles) north east of the city of [[Chichester]]. The village is just south of the [[A285 road]] which follows the line of the [[Roman road]] [[Stane Street (Chichester)|Stane Street]].

The parish has an area of {{convert|1169|ha|acre|abbr=off}}. According to the 2001 census it had a population of 901 people living in 423 households of whom 397 were economically active. The 2011 Census indicated at population of 957.&lt;ref name=ONS/&gt; Included in the parish are the hamlets of [[Crockerhill, West Sussex|Crockerhill]] , Strettington and [[Halnaker]].

==Governance==
An [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom| electoral ward]] in the same name exists. This ward stretches northwest to [[West Dean, West Sussex| West Dean]] with a total population taken at the 2011 census of 2,235. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/boxgrove-e05007603#sthash.scQggLg4.dpbs|title=Ward population 2011|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
{{Main|Boxgrove Quarry}}
Boxgrove is best known for the [[Lower Palaeolithic]] [[archaeology|archaeological]] [[archaeological site|site]] discovered in a gravel quarry known as Amey's Eartham Pit located near the village but in Eartham Parish. Parts of the site complex were excavated between 1983 and 1996 by a team led by Mark Roberts of [[University College London]]. Numerous [[Acheulean]] [[flint tool]]s and remains of animals (some butchered) dating to around 500,000 years ago were found at the site. The area was therefore used by some of the earliest occupants of the [[British Isles]]. Remains of ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' were found on the site in 1994, the only postcranial hominid bone to have been found in Northern Europe. Teeth from another individual were found two years later.

==Boxgrove Priory==
{{Main|Boxgrove Priory}}
A [[Benedictine]] [[monastery]] was founded at Boxgrove by Robert de Haia (or de la Haye) early in the 12th century. The priory church remains as the [[Church of England parish church]] of St. Mary and St. Blaise, minus the original nave, and mostly dates from the 13th century.

==Early cricket==
Several parishioners of Boxgrove were prosecuted for playing [[cricket]] in the churchyard on Sunday, 5 May 1622. There were three reasons for the prosecution: one was that it contravened a local bye-law; another reflected concern about church windows which may or may not have been broken; the third was the now legendary charge that "a little childe had like to have her braines beaten out with a cricket batt"! The latter situation was because the rules at the time allowed the batsman to [[hit the ball twice]] and so [[fielding (cricket)|fielding]] near the batsman was very hazardous, as two later incidents resulting in fatalities drastically confirmed. This is the earliest known reference to the [[cricket bat]].&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p. xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/main.html |title=From Lads to Lord's; The History of Cricket: 1300 – 1787 |publisher=Stumpsite |first=John |last=Leach |date=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629134518/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/main.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Club Deportivo Politécnico''' is an Ecuadorian football club based in [[Quito]]. The club was founded on February 1, 1963, by students and professors from the [[National Polytechnic School]] after [[Sociedad Deportiva España|España]] ceded its franchise to the club. After several participations in the [[Ecuadorian Serie A|Serie A]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the club lost its division level in 1972; since then the team plays the Quito Amateur Championship organized by [[:es:Asociación de Fútbol Amateur de Pichincha|Asociacion de Futbol Amateur de Pichincha (AFAP)]] in order to regain its place in the second division of the [[Ecuadorian football league system]]. The most successful season in club history came in 1967 when it was the runner-up of the regional [[:es:Campeonato Profesional Interandino|Campeonato Profesional Interandino]].

'''Carbohydrate loading''', commonly referred to as '''carb-loading''' or '''carbo-loading''', is a strategy used by endurance athletes, such as runners, to maximise the storage of [[glycogen]] (or energy) in the muscles and liver.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marathontraining.com/articles/art_39th.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbohydrate loading is also used in healthcare to optimise the condition of patients prior to colorectal surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1463-1318.2006.00965.x |title=Pre-operative oral carbohydrate loading in colorectal surgery: A randomized controlled trial |year=2006 |last1=Noblett |first1=S. E. |last2=Watson |first2=D. S. |last3=Huong |first3=H. |last4=Davison |first4=B. |last5=Hainsworth |first5=P. J. |last6=Horgan |first6=A. F. |journal=Colorectal Disease |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=563–9 |pmid=16919107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbohydrate loading is generally recommended for endurance events lasting longer than 90 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbohydrate Loading |url=http://www.powerbar.com/articles/224/carbohydrate-loading.aspx |first1=Christopher D. |last1=Jensen |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324152956/http://www.powerbar.com/articles/224/carbohydrate-loading.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}{{MEDRS|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many endurance athletes prefer foods with low [[Glycemic index|glycemic indices]] for carbo-loading due to their minimal effect on serum glucose levels. Low glycemic foods commonly include vegetables, whole wheat pasta, and grains. Many marathoners and [[triathlon]] participants have large pasta dinners the night before the race. Since muscles also use amino acids extensively when functioning within aerobic limits, meals should also include adequate protein.&lt;ref name="Martini"&gt;{{cite book |title=Human Anatomy |last=Martini |first=Frederic H. |last2=Timmons |first2=Michael J. |last3=Tallitsch |first3=Robert B. |edition=6th |year=2008 |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location= |isbn=978-0-321-50042-7 |page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large portions before a race can, however, decrease race-day performance if the digestive system has not had the time to process the food regimen.

==Without depletion==
Research in the 1980s led to a modified carbo-loading regimen that eliminates the depletion phase, instead calling for increased carbohydrate intake (to about 70% of total calories) and decreased training for three days before the event.&lt;ref name="carbo1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.active.com/nutrition/Articles/The_evolving_art_of_carbo-loading.htm |title=The Evolving Art of Carbo-Loading |first1=Matt |last1=Fitzgerald |date=}}{{MEDRS|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short workout==
A new carbo-loading regimen developed by scientists at the [[University of Western Australia]] calls for a normal diet with light training until the day before the race. On the day before the race, the athlete performs a very short, extremely high-intensity workout (such as a few minutes of sprinting) then consumes {{nowrap|12 g}} of carbohydrate per kilogram of lean mass over the next 24 hours. The regimen resulted in a 90% increase in glycogen storage when compared to before the carbo-load, which is comparable to or higher than the results achieved with other 2 day – 6 day carbo-loading regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=12048325 |title=Rapid carbohydrate loading after a short bout of near maximal-intensity exercise |first1=TJ |last1=Fairchild |first2=S |last2=Fletcher| first3=P |last3=Steele| first4=C |last4=Goodman| first5=B |last5=Dawson| first6=PA |last6=Fournier |date= June 2002| volume=34 | issue=6 | journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc | pages=980–6 | doi=10.1097/00005768-200206000-00012}}{{MEDRS|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transient hypoglycemia==
Carbohydrate ingestion within 2 hours before aerobic exercise triggers elevated levels of insulin in the blood which may dramatically decrease serum glucose levels. This can limit aerobic performance, especially in events lasting longer than 60 minutes. This is known as transient or [[reactive hypoglycemia]], and can be a limiting factor in elite athletes. Individuals susceptible to hypoglycemia are especially at risk for elevated insulin responses and thus will likely suffer from performance-limiting transient hypoglycemia if they do not follow the correct regimen.

==Diet composition==
The composition of carbohydrates in the athlete's diet during carbohydrate loading is as important as their share of the overall caloric intake.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=December 2015}} 

Most dietary carbohydrates consist of varying proportions of two simple sugars, [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]. Fructose may be metabolized into [[liver]] [[glycogen]]{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2015}}, but it is ineffective at raising muscle glycogen levels (which is the objective of carbohydrate loading).{{Citation needed|reason=No mention of fructose in original source|date=September 2018}} Consequently, sources of high-fructose carbohydrates, such as fruit and sugar-based foods, are less than optimal for the task. The classic carb-loading meal is [[pasta]], whose caloric content is primarily due to [[starch]], a polymer of glucose . Other high-starch meals which include [[bread]], [[rice]], and [[potatoes]] are also part of the correct regimen.

[[File:ChampionChip Classic 4 meter system setup.jpg|thumb|300px|ChampionChip{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} system setup. The athlete wears the chip on their shoe. Dutch system based since 1993 on a [[Texas Instruments]] TMS370 [[microcontroller]] from TIRIS.]][[File:2008 Nike+ Human Race in Taipei the ChampionChip.jpg|thumb|100px|The "ChampionChip" is typically attached to a shoe]][[File:ChampionChipTransponderCapsule.jpg|thumb|100px|Glass capsule containing the transponder]]

'''ChampionChip''' is a [[brand name]] of one type of passive [[RFID]] [[transponder]]s, marked with a unique identification number and used in  active sports events to keep track of the competition times of participants.  It is one manufacturer's implementation of [[transponder timing]].

ChampionChip transponders are waterproof glass capsules that contain a silicon chip and an energizing coil.  This coil is inactive until moved into a [[magnetic field]], generated by a send [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] in a mat (used to mark the start and finish lines of a race). The transponder then transmits its unique identification number to a receive antenna in a mat.

Transponder timing is used in [[sport]]ing events around the world, including [[running]] races, [[marathon]]s, [[triathlon]]s, [[cycling]] and [[mountain biking]] competitions, [[in-line skating]] and [[cross-country skiing]].  Chips are either rented for use at a given event or purchased by participants for successive use at events timed with ChampionChip mats (the chips are incompatible with other timing systems).  In either case, the serial number of a participant's chip is stored in a database for an event allowing the recorded times to be matched with participants' names.  Although a chip might transmit its number several times while the athlete is crossing the mat, special software is used to eliminate all but the first time recorded for each chip at each timing point.

In general, transponder timing is only economical for larger events of more than 1,000 participants.  For smaller events, it is less expensive to time participants using manually operated hand-held computers.

When transponder timing first appeared, the running community hoped{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} that there would be a single nationwide United States standard for transponders which could be used at all races. However, the distributor of ChampionChip in the United States has sought to limit the number of timing systems sold{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}, resulting in different event timing companies purchasing incompatible transponder systems from other manufacturers.  Since 2008, systems using disposable transponders have replaced ChampionChips at a number of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://karlo.org/2009/01/tagging-runners-with-disposabl.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201063220/http://karlo.org/2009/01/tagging-runners-with-disposabl.html |archivedate=2009-02-01 |df= }} Retrieved 2009-04-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gsrs.com/ct.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427113640/http://www.gsrs.com/ct.php |archivedate=2009-04-27 |df= }} Retrieved 2009-04-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

ChampionChip was a Nijmegen, [[Netherlands]] based company, started in 1993 by a group of students to improve the time tracking in the [[Zevenheuvelenloop]]. In 2008, ChampionChip was merged with AMB i.t. to form a new company called [[MYLAPS Sports Timing]].

'''Darwin Doronis Bonilla Salgado''' (born 6 August 1990 in [[Chirilagua]], [[El Salvador]]) is a  former [[Salvadoran]] footballer who last played for [[C.D. Águila]] in the [[Primera División (El Salvador)|Salvadoran Premier League]].

==Club career==
Bonilla's professional career began in July 2008 when he signed a contract with [[Salvadoran]] national league club, [[C.D. Águila]], after he had already joined them 2 years earlier from [[C.D. Dragón|Dragón]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elgrafico.com/gol-nacional/primera/tabla-de-posiciones-apertura-2010/player/7/191.html Profile] - El Gráfico {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his professional debut on September 13, 2008, in a league match against [[C.D. Vista Hermosa]], and scored his first goal on November 5 that same year in a league match against [[C.D. Luis Ángel Firpo]].

On September 20, 2013, Bonilla was one of 14 Salvadoran players banned for life due to their involvement with match fixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-24184567 |title= El Salvador match-fixing: 14 footballers banned for life |publisher= BBC |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, at the formation of the [[Government of the 25th Dáil|20th government]], the Department of Transport was abolished, in accordance with section 14 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1983. At the same time, the Department of the Public Service, which had been established by the [[Ministers and Secretaries Acts#New departments|Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1973]], was renamed as the Department of Tourism and Transport, and the substantive functions of the Department of the Public Service were transferred to the Department of Finance; therefore, the current Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is formally a successor to the Department of the Public Service established in 1973.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24840">[[sponsor (commercial)|Corporate sponsorship]] of major [[Football in England|English football]] competitions dates back to the early 1980s, although minor competitions such as the [[Watney Cup]] and [[Texaco Cup]] were sponsored during the early 1970s.

==Sponsorship deals==
The first competition to negotiate a [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] deal was the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], negotiating a deal in 1982 with the [[Dairy Crest|Milk Marketing Board]]. It became known as the "Milk Cup" and has since adopted the name of its sponsors in this same way.&lt;ref name = "Liverpool Echo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why League Cup is vital to survival|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/everton-fc/everton-fc-news/2002/11/11/why-league-cup-is-vital-to-survival-100252-12354887/|date=11 November 2002|accessdate=15 March 2013|publisher=Liverpool Echo|first=Peter|last=Sharkey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season in 1983 the [[Football League]] negotiated a sponsorship deal with [[Canon Inc.|Canon]]. Since the formation of the breakaway [[Premier League]] in 1992, the competition has struck up its own sponsorship deals separately from the Football League (though it was unsponsored in its [[1992–93 FA Premier League|first season]] after a $17.1&amp;nbsp;million agreement with [[Bass Brewery]] was vetoed by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sport Shorts|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cgsgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=T2UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=nottingham%20forest&amp;pg=5561%2C464457|newspaper=Sun Journal|location=Lewiston|date=4 August 1992|accessdate=28 May 2013|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The last major English competition to negotiate a sponsorship deal was in fact its oldest, the [[FA Cup]]. The competition was sponsored by [[Littlewoods]] for four seasons, starting in 1994,&lt;ref name = "Littlewoods"&gt;{{cite news|title=F.A. Cup Soccer Gets A Sponsor|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E1DF1538F931A3575AC0A962958260|publisher=New York Times|date=2 September 1994|accessdate=13 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[AXA|AXA Insurance]] for four seasons starting in 1998.&lt;ref name = "Axa wins FA Cup"&gt;{{cite news|title=Axa wins FA Cup|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/138103.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=23 July 1998|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was always carefully named, being the "AXA-sponsored FA Cup", or the "FA Cup sponsored by AXA", and never the "AXA Cup". From 2002–03 through 2005–06, the FA Cup did not have a dedicated sponsor, but instead shared the team of sponsors of [[The Football Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FA breaks AXA link|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/1847693.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=1 March 2002|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sponsor's fury over FA Cup|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/sponsors-fury-over-fa-cup-671260.html|publisher=The Independent|first=Steve|last=Tongue|date=29 September 2001|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From [[2006–07 FA Cup|2006]] to [[2010–11 FA Cup|2011]], the FA Cup was known as "The FA Cup sponsored by E.ON" due to a deal with energy company [[E.ON UK|E.ON]].&lt;ref name = "E On BBC Sport"&gt;{{cite news|title=FA announces new Cup sponsorship|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/4676576.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=3 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 2011–12 season to the 2013–14 season, the FA Cup was sponsored by [[Budweiser|Budweiser Beer]] and known as the FA Cup with Budweiser.&lt;ref name = "Budweiser BBC Sport"&gt;{{cite news|title=FA Cup to be sponsored by Budweiser beer|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13792977|work=BBC News|date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8823">This is a '''glossary of terms used in [[Canadian football]]'''. The [[Glossary of American football]] article also covers many terms that are also used in the Canadian version of the game.

; [[Canadian Football League]] : The largest professional Canadian football league, with 9 teams split into two divisions each (West and East).
; [[Canadian Junior Football League]] : The largest non-professional minor junior football league in Canada.
; [[Conversion (gridiron football)|conversion]] : An untimed down awarded to a team that has just scored a touchdown. The scoring team receives possession on the opponent's 5-yard line. A place kick or drop kick through the uprights is worth 1 point; a play from scrimmage that would result in an offensive touchdown at other times in the game is worth 2 points. (This play is formally called a "try" in American football, but the terms "conversion", "PAT" [point after touchdown], and "point after" are more commonly used; the scrimmage play is called a "two-point conversion".)
; [[Conversion (gridiron football)|convert]] : see: conversion.
; [[cornerback]] : A defensive position on scrimmages.  Typical formations include two cornerbacks, whose main duty is to cover wide receivers.  See also defensive back.
; [[defensive back]] : One of the players whose main duty is to cover wide receivers. Typical defensive formations include five defensive backs: two cornerbacks, two defensive halfbacks, and one safety.
; [[defensive end]] : See defensive lineman.
; [[defensive halfback]] : A defensive position on scrimmages.  Typical formations include two defensive halfbacks, one on each side, but deeper than the cornerbacks. Their main duty is to cover wide receivers.  See also defensive back.
; [[defensive lineman]] : One of the players who line up opposite the offensive line on scrimmages. In a "four-three" formation, there are four defensive linemen: two defensive tackles and two defensive ends. In a "three-four" formation, there are three defensive linemen: one nose tackle and two defensive ends.
; [[defensive tackle]] : See defensive lineman.
; dribbled ball : A dribbled ball is one that has been kicked while not in possession of a player, for example, a loose ball following a fumble, a blocked kick, a kickoff, or a kick from scrimmage. The kicker of the dribbled ball and any player onside when the ball was kicked may legally recover the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Official Playing Rules for the Canadian Football League 2009|publisher=Canadian Football League|url=http://cfl.ca/uploads/assets/CFL/PDF_Docs/CFL_Rulebook_2009.pdf|location=Toronto|pages=37|chapter=Rule 5 - Kicking}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[illegal procedure]] : A five-yard penalty against the kicking team or the offence.  Most often it is a lineman who moves after taking a three- or four-point stance but before the snap. Other illegal procedures include kicking the ball out of bounds on a kick-off and "no end".
; [[linebacker]] : A defensive player positioned behind the defensive line on scrimmages.  In a "four-three" formation, there are three linebackers; in a "three-four", there are four.  Linebackers can be used to blitz the quarterback, make tackles on running plays, or be used for pass coverage.
; major or major score : An alternate term for [[touchdown]].
; [[no end]] : A penalty on the offence for having fewer than seven players within one yard of the line of scrimmage at the snap. It is most often called on field goal attempts because of the curved formation of linemen used:  if the line is curved back too far, the ends are too far back to be considered linemen, and are called for "illegal procedure: no end". (This violation is known as an "illegal formation" in the American game.)
; [[nose tackle]] : See defensive lineman.
; [[no yards]] : A penalty against the kicking team: all offside (sense 2) players must be at least five yards from the ball when it is first touched by a member of the receiving team. In amateur rules, no yards is always a 15-yard penalty; in [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] rules, the penalty is reduced to five yards if the ball hits the ground before being touched.
; [[offside (American and Canadian football)|offside]] : Not onside. A player not onside incurs a five-yard penalty.
; [[onside]]
# Legally positioned at the kick-off or the snap.  On kick-offs, members of the kicking team must be behind the kick-off line; members of the receiving team must be at least 10 yards from the kick-off line. On scrimmages, at the snap the offence must be behind the line of scrimmage; the defence must be at least one yard beyond the line of scrimmage.
# A player of the kicking team who can legally recover the kick.  The kicker himself and any teammates behind the ball at the time of the kick are onside.  Thus on kick-offs all players of the kicking team are onside, but on other kicks usually only the kicker is.  The holder on a place kick is not considered onside.
; [[onside kick]] : A kick recovered by an onside player (sense 2).
; pivot : An alternate term for the [[quarterback]].
; [[quick kick]] : A type of trick play: a punt from a running or passing formation, usually on second down.  The play relies on catching the defence by surprise and using an onside player (sense 2) to recover the ball and gain a first down or even a touchdown.  A rule change in the early 1970s that allowed the receiving team to block before gaining possession made the quick kick even more difficult to execute successfully, so it is rarely attempted today.
; [[single (football)|rouge]] : see: single.
; safety
#A [[safety (American football position)|defensive position]] on scrimmages, also called free safety.  Typical formations include a single safety, whose main duty is to cover wide receivers.  See also defensive back.
#A [[safety (American football score)|two-point score]]. The defence scores a safety when the offence carries or passes the ball into its own goal area and then fails to run, pass, or kick the ball back into the field of play.
; [[short kick-off]] : Deliberately kicking the ball just over 10 yards on a kick-off in an attempt to make an onside kick.  Short kick-offs are usually directed towards the sideline (left sideline for a right-footed kicker) to give members of the kicking team time to get downfield to recover it. It is illegal procedure if the ball is recovered before it has gone 10 yards downfield.
; [[single (football)|single]] : A one-point score.  The kicking team scores a single when the ball is punted, drop kicked, or place kicked into the receiving team's end zone (without scoring a field goal or hitting the goal post) and the receiving team fails to run or kick the ball back into the field of play. The single also is scored if the kick goes out of bounds in the end zone, except on a kickoff. On a kickoff, the single is scored only if the ball stays inbounds and is not run out of the zone, or if the defence puts the ball out of bounds in the end zone.
; spearing : An unnecessary roughness penalty of 15 yards imposed when the player drives his helmet into an opponent in an unnecessary and excessive manner. The referee's signal is a chopping motion above the head.
; [[three-minute warning (football)|three-minute warning]] : In the [[Canadian Football League]], the '''three-minute warning''' is given when three minutes of game time remain on the game clock in the first and second halves of a game.
; time count : A foul committed when the offence fails to put the ball in play within 20 seconds of the ball being declared ready for play. (This foul is called "delay of game" in American football.) Penalty: Before the three-minute warning and during convert attempts at any time in the game, 5 yards with the down repeated. After the three-minute warning, loss of down on first or second down and 10 yards on third down; the referee has the right to give possession to the defence for repeated time count violations on third down.
; [[U Sports]]: The principal governing body of college sports in Canada, including college football. The organization has been formerly known as the Canadian Interuniversity Athletic Union, Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union, and Canadian Interuniversity Sport.
; [[yard]] : A [[yard]] is exactly 0.9144 metre. Despite [[Metrication in Canada|Canada having mostly migrated to the metric system]] in the 1970s, the field in Canadian football remains measured in yards (as is the field in American football).

'''Grand Stade de Casablanca''' is a proposed title of the planned [[Association football|football]] [[stadium]] ([[soccer]] stadium) to be built in [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]]. Once completed in 2025, it will be used mostly for football matches and will serve as the home of [[Raja Casablanca]], [[Wydad Casablanca]] and the [[Morocco national football team]]. The stadium is planned with a capacity of 93,000 spectators, making it the third-highest capacity football stadium in Africa. If completed, it will replace [[Stade Mohamed V]].

==Overview==
The initial idea of the stadium was for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|World Cup in 2010]], for which Morocco lost their [[FIFA World Cup hosts#2010 FIFA World Cup|bid]] to South Africa.  This included five major stadiums across the country, including [[Stade de Tanger]], [[Stade de Marrakech]] and two more in the major cities of Agadir and Fes. It was one of the 14 host venues for Morocco's bid to host the [[Morocco 2026 FIFA World Cup bid|World Cup in 2026]]. It would've staged the Opening and Final matches if Morocco was awarded for the World Cup but lost out to the joint bid of [[Canada]]/[[Mexico]]/[[United States]]. It is now planning on bidding for the [[2030 FIFA World Cup]] with [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]].

'''HKK Zrinjski Mostar''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatski košarkaški klub Zrinjski Mostar}}, {{lang-en|Croat Basketball Club Zrinjski Mostar}}) is a [[basketball]] team from the city of [[Mostar]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The club plays in the [[Basketball Championship of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

== History ==
The club is part of the [[Zrinjski Mostar]] sport society. Since the national championship was formed in 1997, it has spent all but two seasons in the top league: the inaugural season and the 2003–04 season. For the 2003–04 season, Zrinjski was relegated to the regional Croatian league, but bounced back the following year to return to the top level of play. Since its return to the national championship it has placed in the top half of the table as well as reaching the semifinals in the [[Basketball Cup of Bosnia and Herzegovina|national cup]] twice.

The club's current coach is Hrvoje Vlašić. A feeder club, often known as Zrinjski II, plays in the lower Croatian league. Fans of HKK Zrinjski are known as [[Ultras Zrinjski|Ultras]].

In 2018, the club conquered their first [[Basketball Championship of Bosnia and Herzegovina|National league]] title ever.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27319">The [[France national rugby union team|French national rugby union team]] first competed at the [[1900 Summer Olympics]].

==Early years==
[[File:France XV v New Zealand 1906.jpeg|thumb|The original France XV v New Zealand, 1 January 1906, Paris]]

Rugby was introduced to the Le Havre region of [[France]] by British merchants and students in the 1870s and was subsequently spread throughout the schools and colleges.&lt;ref name="hundyears"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/EN/News/Features/061114+dk+fre+rugby+100.htm |title=100 years of French Test rugby: part one |publisher=International Rugby Board |author=Chris Thau |date=2006-11-14 |accessdate=2007-03-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711235014/http://www.irb.com/EN/News/Features/061114%2Bdk%2Bfre%2Brugby%2B100.htm |archivedate=2007-07-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first clubs were established in the late 1870s and early 1880s, with a club championship soon formed, and games against English clubs organised.&lt;ref name="hundyears"/&gt; The first involvement a national rugby union side had was at the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Paris Olympics]], where a French team took part in the tournament and defeated Britain (represented by Mosley Wanderers RFC) 27 – 8 and Germany 27–17 to win the gold medal.&lt;ref name="olympics"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/olympics.htm#france1900| title=Rugby at the 1924 Olympics | publisher=Rugby Football History | accessdate=2007-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the team represent France at the 1900 games are not considered to be a Test XV.&lt;ref name="hundyears"/&gt;

On January 1, 1906 France played its first ever Test match – a 38–8 loss to [[Dave Gallaher]]'s [[All Blacks]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="ABGame88"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://stats.allblacks.com/asp/teamsheet.asp?MT_ID=1088 |title=8th All Black Test : 88th All Black Game |publisher=allblacks.com |accessdate=2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Complete Rugby Footballer'', Gallaher and [[Billy Stead]] wrote of French rugby; "We are strongly of the opinion that the game will spread in their country and that in the course of time they will put a team in the field which will command the utmost respect of any other."&lt;ref name="ABGame88"/&gt; France first played [[England national rugby union team|England]] in March of that year, again in France, this time losing 35–8.&lt;ref name="FranceEngland1906"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://2rugby.com/game/4551/ |title=France vs England |publisher=2rugby.com |accessdate=2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France played their first Test outside their nation on the January 1, 1907, losing to England 31–13 at the Athletic Ground in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]]. Two days later they played a game against the Springboks in [[Parc des Princes]], Paris with a side made up from the two Parisian clubs: Stade Français and Racing Club de France. Only two of the side that had faced the All Blacks played against the Springboks – three-quarter Paul Sagot and forward Georges Jérôme – and none was in the team that had played England. The Springboks scored 13 tries in winning 55–6.

==The Five Nations and the Olympics==

[[File:France rugby 1924.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The team that played at the [[Rugby at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Summer Olympics]].]]

France played [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] for the first time on 2 March 1908, losing 36 – 14 away from home. On March 20, 1909, France played [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] for the first time, falling 19–8.

When [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] played France in the first official international match between the two countries in 1910, the foundation was laid for a [[Six Nations Championship|Five Nations competition]]. Their first win in the competition came against Scotland 16–15 in Paris in 1911. In early 1913, France was host to a touring [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] party, France lost 5 points to 35, the match was part of an era that last from 1911 until 1920 which saw France lose 18 games in a row.

In 1919, the [[Fédération Française de Rugby]] was formed, 13 years after France's Test debut. At the [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Antwerp Olympics]] there was another rugby event and France was one of only two teams to enter. A straight final took place between the USA and France but the USA caused a shock by winning 8–0 to take the gold medal.&lt;ref name="olympics"/&gt; Their first win in the five nations against Ireland was attained in 1920 in [[Dublin]] – 15–7. During their last match of the 1921 Five Nations, France showed signs of new strength beating Ireland 20 to 10. Though France did not win a game the following year, the side did draw with Scotland and England.

For the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics held in Paris]] rugby union was again included. France scored 13 tries to comfortably defeated Romania 59–3, with winger Adolphe Jaureguy scoring four. The final took place at Colombes Stadium in Paris on May 18, 1924 and the USA took the gold with a 17–3 victory in front of 30,000 spectators.&lt;ref name="olympics"/&gt; The All Blacks returned to France in 1925, the first time since their inaugural Test against them in 1906, France lost 6 to 30.&lt;ref name="nz25"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stats.allblacks.com/asp/tourbreak.asp?IDID=22| title=Australia, the British Isles, France and Canada | publisher=Allblacks.com | accessdate=2007-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expelled from Five Nations==
The mid to late 1920s was a period of disappointment for the French, that is until they won their first games over England and Wales, in 1927 and 1928 respectively. France had mediocre results on field during the latter end of the decade and the start of the 1930s, but showed definite signs of improvements in the Five Nations. However, they were expelled from the Five Nations in 1932 following accusations of professionalism in the French league as well as on-field violence and poor organisation and were not allowed to rejoin until 1939.&lt;ref name="fivenations"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rugbyworld.com/Story/0,18830,3551_1884973,00.html| title=2/3/4/5/6 Nations Winners| publisher=Rugby World| accessdate=2007-03-04| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006193153/http://www.rugbyworld.com/Story/0%2C18830%2C3551_1884973%2C00.html| archivedate=2007-10-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time many French players turned to [[rugby league]], which began to build in popularity, as the latter code was excluded from the Five Nations. Despite this there were some internationals played; [[Germany national rugby union team|Germany]] between 1932 and 1936, [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]] (1937) and [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]] (1938). On 2 January 1934 [[FIRA - Association of European Rugby|FIRA]] was formed, an organisation to rival the [[International Rugby Board]] (IRB). Having been expelled from the Five Nations and forced to play against weaker opposition, France went on a winning spree which still stands today, winning ten games in a row during the years from 1931 to 1936. In 1939, the FFR was invited to send a team to the Five Nations Championship for the following season, but when war was declared, international rugby was suspended. While occupied by Germany during the Second World War, [[Vichy France]] banned [[rugby league]] and forced its integration into French rugby union.

==Post war==
[[File:Argentina France rugby 1954.jpeg|thumb|right|150px|France playing [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] at [[Buenos Aires]], in 1954.]]
The Five nations resumed after the second World War in 1947 and French rugby came of age. [[Lucien Mias]] was the innovative captain whose [[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]] ploys brought a new attacking dimension to forward play. France beat Wales in 1948 and England in 1951. In 1952, France played their second match against the Springboks and again lost 25–3. France claimed a share of the Five Nations title for the first time in 1954 alongside England and Wales. France also recorded their first win over New Zealand 3–0 at Stade Colombes in 1954.&lt;ref name="FrenchRenaissance"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nobok.co.uk/page/RugbyTimeDetail/0,,10301~791109,00.html |title=1954: French renaissance |publisher=nobok.co.uk |accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, France had defeated England, Ireland and Scotland, a win against Wales would give France its first ever Grand Slam. However France lost to Wales 11–16 at Stade Colombes in Paris.

The French became the first northern hemisphere country to tour South Africa in 1958. They upset the Springboks by winning the two-Test series. Led by Lucien Mias, in the absence of tour skipper Michel Celaya who had been injured, the underestimated French drew the first Test 3–3 at [[Newlands Stadium|Newlands]] and then produced an even bigger shock by beating the Springboks 9–5 at altitude at [[Ellis Park Stadium|Ellis Park]]. That series victory signalled that France were now a top rugby nation. Victories over Scotland and Wales at the Stade Colombes, together with a 3–3 draw with England at Twickenham earned France their first outright Five Nations title in 1959. They arrived in Dublin as champions, only to be denied a Grand Slam by a 9–5 defeat.&lt;ref name="FindingWilliam"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nobok.co.uk/page/RugbyTimeDetail/0,,10301~791108,00.html |title=1959: Finding William |publisher=nobok.co.uk |accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The sixties==
Les Bleus scored four tries to one at Cardiff Arms Park and beating Ireland with a record score, 23–6. France's match against England ended in a stalemate and the two sides had to share the 1960 Five Nations trophy. [[Pierre Albaladejo]] set a record for the most drop goals, three, in the 23–6 victory over Ireland. France then embarked on a tour of Argentina. In three Tests, France scored 78 points in three victories while the Pumas scored only 12 points.&lt;ref name="Stalemate"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nobok.co.uk/page/RugbyTimeDetail/0,,10301~791046,00.html |title=1960: Stalemate |publisher=nobok.co.uk |accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, the French won the five nations championship outright. The Springboks formidable 1960/61 touring side defeated Scotland, Ireland, England and Wales but were held to a 0–0 draw at Stade Colombes. The game was almost abandoned after fighting broke out. The Tricolours became the first European national team to tour New Zealand in 1961. Les Bleus went on to lose half of the provincial games and both Tests to New Zealand 5–3 and 32–3. The French played a single Test on Australian soil and went home with a 15–8 win over the Wallabies.&lt;ref name="DebutRemember"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nobok.co.uk/page/RugbyTimeDetail/0,,10301~791047,00.html |title=1961: A debut to remember |publisher=nobok.co.uk |accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France won the 1962 Five Nations, but missed out on the Grand Slam again after losing to Wales for the fourth consecutive year. France lost a Test to Romania at the end of the year and in 1964 again toured South Africa. They lost only one of their six games and defeated South Africa 8–6. According to [[Danie Craven]] the Test was the worst seen in South Africa up until that time.

France set a then record win over England in 1966. After back-to-back Welsh wins, the French won the 1967 Five nations title. The title came down to the last match of the championship against Ireland at Lansdowne Road which France won 11–6, only a 9–8 defeat by Scotland preventing them from winning a Grand Slam. France embarked on their first full-scale tour of South Africa. They were beaten 26–3 in Durban and 16–3 in the "Battle of Bloemfontein" but were able to come back and win the third 19–14 in Johannesburg and draw the last 6–6 in Cape Town.

In 1967, they again won the five nations championship. They returned to South Africa, but lost the Test series 2–1 with one match draw. Fifty-eight years after contesting their first Five Nations tournament, France won their first 'Grand Chelem' with a 14–9 win over Wales at the Arms Park in 1968. However, it was overshadowed by the deaths of Guy Boniface and Jean-Michael Capendeguy in road accidents. They  toured New Zealand but once again failed to make an impact, losing the series 3–0. France imploded the following year, losing their first three matches to Scotland, Ireland and England but draw with Wales to deny them a Grand Slam.

==The seventies==
Les Bleus continued to feature as a major player in the five nations, finishing first equal in 1970, second in 1971. In 1972, in the final international played at the Yves du Manoir Stadium at Colombes, France marked the occasion by scoring six tries to one and racking up their biggest ever win against England 37–12. [[Jean Desclaux]] coached France between 1973 and 1980. The 1976 Championship went well for France, their only loss came against [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] and they beat [[England national rugby union team|England]] 30–9. 1977 saw France win their second Grand Slam with [[Jacques Fouroux]] as captain. No tries were scored against them and they fielded an unchanged team throughout the championship. In November, France beat New Zealand 18–10 in Toulouse but the All Blacks squared the series in Paris by winning 15–3. In the 1978 five nations championship, France met Wales in a Grand Slam decider at the Cardiff Arms Park, the Welsh ran out 16–9 victors. In March 1978, France finally became a full member of the International Rugby Board. France overcame a first Test defeat to beat the All Blacks in New Zealand for the first time 24–19 on Bastille day 14 July 1979 at Eden Park.

==The eighties and early nineties==
On the 8th of November 1980, France play their last international against South Africa in the apartheid era. They were led by Jean-Pierre Rives and lost 15–37 to the Springboks at Newlands in what was termed the "Summer Test". [[Jacques Fouroux]] became the coach of France shortly before the 1981 Five Nations tournament. In the ten years that he managed the side, France won the Five Nations on six occasions and two Grand Slams (1981 and 1987). France's successes were based around their massive pack, a fact which upset a number of commentators in France who preferred a more technical approach. Famous names from this time included [[Philippe Sella]], [[Daniel Dubroca]] and [[Serge Blanco]].

In 1981 France clinched the Grand Slam at Twickenham. The 1983 championship came down to the last game played against holders Ireland at Lansdowne Road, Ireland triumphed 22–16. Scotland and France meet in a Grand Slam decider at Murrayfield, the Scots secure the Grand Slam. The 1986 Five Nations title is shared by Scotland and France after both won three games and lost one. An inexperienced team New Zealand team arrived in France in the autumn. The vast majority of New Zealand's top players had taken part in a rebel tour of South Africa in 1986 and had been banned. Despite this the 'Baby Blacks' won 19–7 in Toulouse. France won 16–3 over the All Blacks in the 'Battle of Nantes' in 1986.

France entered the [[1987 Rugby World Cup|inaugural World Cup]] as one of the favourites. France beat [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] 30–24 in the semi final, coming from behind three times to triumph. France were unable to repeat the feat in the final against favourites [[All Blacks|New Zealand]] losing 29–9. After an embarrassing 12–6 defeat to [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]] on French soil, Fouroux was given the sack. The 1988 Five Nations is shared between France and Wales. France again win the Five Nations in 1989, but are denied the Grand Slam by England, who triumph 11–0.

With the ban on playing South Africa lifted, France toured South Africa. Tour captain Jean-Francois Tordo was injured playing against Western Province, and was replaced as captain by Olivier Roumat. France won the Test series following a draw and win over their hosts – the win an 18–17 victory at Ellis Park. The series win was unexpected: they had previously lost to a South Africa B side, lost to provincial side Northern Transvaal, and drawn with Free State province. France were knocked out by England in the quarter-finals in the [[1991 Rugby World Cup]].

The early 1990s had seen France in the shadow of England. Eight consecutive defeats to Will Carling's teams, starting in 1989, underlined the indiscipline of French rugby. An isolated Five Nations title came in 1993, as England slipped to defeats in Cardiff and Dublin. In 1992, Argentina stunned France 24–20 in Nantes, the Pumas' first ever win on French soil. On their 1994 tour of New Zealand, the French, under captain [[Philippe Saint-André]], recorded a 2–0 series win over the All Blacks. The series win was sealed by the famous "try from the end of the world", which saw Saint-André begin a counterattack from deep in France's end in the final minutes that ended with [[Jean-Luc Sadourny]] scoring the winning try. France were desperately unlucky to lose in the semi-finals to the hosts and eventual champions [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] in [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995]]. The miserable run against the English finally came to an end in the third place play-off at the 1995 World Cup.

==Professional era==
[[Image:France Ecosse 6-02-2004.jpg|right|thumb|300px|France (white) playing Scotland in 2004.]]
As the game adjusted to the new professional era, the Championship was very much dominated by England, who coming off the 1995 win, backed up with a tournament win in 1996. During the tournament, France actually defeated England, but it was their one-point loss to Wales that prevented them from taking the title. After the Five Nations France hosted Romania, and later travelled to Argentina for a two match series; winning all fixtures. At the end of the year, they met Wales, who had beaten them in their last game of the Five Nations, though this time France won, 40 to 33, though this was followed by two losses to the Springboks at home.

After narrowly missing out on the 1996 Five Nations championship, France entered the tournament with confidence, and went through the competition undefeated. After the win, France played aspiring Five Nations entrants Italy, who defeated France 40 points to 32. After defeating Romania, France continued on to Australia for a two Test series, which they lost. At the end of the year, France defeated Italy, Romania and Argentina at home, and against host South Africa for a two Test series, losing both, the second by 40 points.

Despite performing poorly against the southern hemisphere teams of Australia and South Africa in 1997, France successfully defended their Five Nations title, and again completed a grand slam of the tournament, even defeating Wales 51 to nil. France also hosted Australia at the end of the year, though the Wallabies won, 32 to 21. Their Five Nations title defense was off to a weak start, after defeating Ireland by just one point. France went on to lose every other match and finished [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden-spoonists]] in the last ever Five Nations. [[Bernard Laporte]] became the first fully professional head coach at the end of 1999.

After mixed results during the mid-year, France stormed through the group stages at the [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999 World Cup]] to finish atop of their pool. After defeating Argentina 47 to 26  in the quarter-finals, France proceeded to the semi-finals, where they met red hot favourites, the All Blacks. Trailing by 14 point at the beginning of the second half, Fabien Pelous’ toops mounted an outstanding display of attacking rugby, scoring 30 consecutive points to triumph 43–31. In the final,they met Australia; fatigue took hold as they were beaten convincingly 35 to 12 at Cardiff's new [[Millennium Stadium]].

==21st century==
In 2000, Italy joined the Five Nations, making the tournament the Six Nations. France did not perform to expectations in the revamped tournament, losing to both England and Ireland and finishing second behind England. After defeating Romania 67 to 20, France hosted Australia in Paris, who beat them 18 to 13 in a 1999 World Cup final re-match. This was followed by a two Test series against the All Blacks, which France lost one and won one.

France again did not perform that well in the 2001 Six Nations, losing to Ireland, Wales and England; and only finishing fifth. They did however manage victories over South Africa and Australia at the end of the year, as well as an impressive 77 to 10 win over Fiji. France went undefeated in the [[2002 Six Nations Championship]] to claim the first Six Nations grand slam. Though they later lost two games to Australia, France defeated South Africa, and drew with the All Blacks that year.

France lost two matches at the [[2003 Six Nations Championship|2003 Six Nations]], including their opening game with England, who would go on to win a grand slam. France finished only third. After the strong showing at the World Cup, France reproduced their Six Nations success of 2002 at the [[2004 Six Nations Championship]]. France won all five of their matches to win the tournament and complete a grandslam. France finished second, behind Wales in the [[2005 Six Nations Championship]], and the following year at the [[2006 Six Nations Championship|2006 tournament]], France won again, getting their third Six Nations trophy under Laporte.

In preparation for the [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003 World Cup]], France played Argentina, the All Blacks and England, with mixed results. France won their opening match against Fiji at [[Brisbane]]'s [[Suncorp Stadium]], which saw them continue undefeated through the rest of the pool stages. They met Ireland at [[Telstra Dome]] in [[Melbourne]] in the quarter finals, which they won 43 points to 21. France then met England at [[Telstra Stadium]] in [[Sydney]], and went down seven to 24. At the same venue, France contested for third place with the All Blacks, and lost, finishing fourth overall in the tournament.

The following year France completed a tournament grand slam of the [[2004 Six Nations Championship|2004 Six Nations]], including a win over World Champions England. After a short successful tour of North America, France played southern hemisphere teams, Australia, Argentina and the All Blacks; losing all three. In 2005 France completed another strong Six Nations, losing only to eventual grand slam winners Wales. France lost a two Test series to South Africa, and lost  to Australia during the mid-year. At the end of the year, France continued Australia's run of losses, and completed heavy wins over Canada and Tonga, and a close victory over South Africa. France lost their opening game of the [[2006 Six Nations Championship|2006 Six Nations]], 16 to 20 to Scotland, but went on to defeat the other four nations to win the Six Nations.

In their final tournament before the [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007 World Cup]], France's defence of their title proved again successful, although it came down to the final minutes of their last [[2007 Six Nations Championship|6 Nations]] game to regain the crown. France needed to beat Scotland by more than the Irish beat Italy to ensure that they would be champions again. They were successful, winning the Championship by 4 points.

France failed to retain their crown in [[2008 Six Nations Championship|2008]], finishing third overall. Despite beating Scotland, Italy and Ireland, France's Grand Slam dreams went up in smoke after a poor, aimless performance against England. France also failed to deny Wales the Grand Slam in the final game losing 29–12.

France won the [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]] again in [[2010 Six Nations Championship|2010]] by beating [[England national rugby union team|England]] 12–10 in [[Stade de France|Paris]] in their final match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/england/7487203/Six-Nations-2010-France-12-England-10.html|title=France 12 England 10: match report|date=2010-03-20|work=Telegraph|accessdate=2010-03-20 | location=London | first=Paul | last=Ackford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France's [[2011 Rugby World Cup]] campaign was marked by turmoil within the camp. Reports before the tournament indicated as many as 25 of the 30-member squad had turned against head coach [[Marc Lièvremont]].&lt;ref name="Imanol postmortem"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/france/rugby/story/153440.html |title=Harinordoquy admits to French uprising |work=ESPN Scrum |date=2011-10-31 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In pool play, France had unimpressive wins over [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]] and [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]], an expected loss to [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]], and a shock loss to [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]]. During this stage, Lièvremont heavily criticized the team in the media, further angering many of his players. Veteran number 8 [[Imanol Harinordoquy]] responded publicly, attacking Lièvremont for taking his criticism public instead of keeping it within the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/france/rugby/story/151169.html |title=Harinordoquy hits back at Lièvremont |work=ESPN Scrum |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the losses, they qualified for the knockout stage. At this time, the players rebelled against Lièvremont, with Harinordoquy telling the French rugby publication ''Midi Olympique'' after the tournament, "We had to free ourselves from his supervision."&lt;ref name="Imanol postmortem"/&gt; The team responded by defeating [[England national rugby union team|England]] 19–12 in the quarter final and controversially beating [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] 9–8 in the semi-final after Welsh captain [[Sam Warburton]] was sent off.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/rugby-world-cup/8827806/Wales-8-France-9-match-report.html ''The Telegraph''. Retrieved 2011-10-15.]&lt;/ref&gt; The French proved admirable opponents in the final, losing out to New Zealand 8–7 to finish second for the third time in a [[Rugby World Cup]].

'''Homestead Sports Complex''' is a [[baseball]] training facility located less than three miles from downtown [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]], [[Florida]].  The facility seats 6,500 and expands to 9,000, and provides parking for over 3,900 vehicles. A 200-bed dormitory facility located on the grounds of the Homestead Sports Complex complements the training facilities. The dormitories consist of 30 single rooms and 84 double rooms that are complete with restrooms, showers, dressing areas, a full service kitchen and recreational areas.

==History==
In 1991 the [[City of Homestead]] built the Sports Complex at a price tag of $22 million in order to provide a [[spring training]] facility for the [[Cleveland Indians]].  The stadium was widely recognized as being state-of-the-art for the time period, as it included multiple practice facilities as well as dormitories for players.  The Indians had previously played in the [[Cactus League]] in Arizona but had signed a deal to make Homestead their long-term spring training home.  Cleveland was due to begin full-time play at the stadium in the 1993 season.  In 1992 they had already begun moving equipment and personnel to Florida.  However, on August 24, 1992, [[Hurricane Andrew]] made landfall in Homestead as a Category 5 [[cyclone]] with winds reaching 165&amp;nbsp;mph.  The stadium, directly in the path of the hurricane, was decimated.  The Indians quickly began meetings with lawyers and eventually they exercised an "out clause" in the contract.

The city decided to immediately re-construct the stadium hoping that they could have it built for the 1994 spring training season in order for the Indians, or perhaps another team to use.  However, without a spring facility for the 1993 season Cleveland was forced to look quickly for another home.  The [[Boston Red Sox]] were leaving [[Winter Haven, Florida]]'s [[Chain of Lakes Park]] after 26 years, allowing the Indians to use Chain of Lakes as their spring facility.  However, knowing the situation that the Indians were in, Winter Haven allowed the team to use the stadium on the condition that they sign a 10-year contract.  Cleveland had no other choice, so they signed the deal and left Homestead without a team.

Homestead decided to continue re-building the stadium, assuming that at some point in the future they could lure another team to use it as their spring facility.  The stadium was re-constructed in a very short period of time, as the original blueprints were kept.  However, after about five years without a tenant it started to appear that the facility may never be used as a home for baseball.  In the meantime, new spring training facilities were constructed such as [[Roger Dean Stadium]] in [[Jupiter, Florida]] and [[Champion Stadium]] at [[Walt Disney World]].  The new stadiums began to surpass Homestead Sports Complex in terms of facility size and technology.  The city had to look at other options in order to pay the nearly $450,000 per year in order to maintain it.

It was offered as a home for the [[US Soccer Federation]] to conduct its training, but they declined.  In 1999 the facility was used as part of the filming of the [[Oliver Stone]] movie ''[[Any Given Sunday]]''.  In 2002 an [[HBO]] series called ''Baseball Wives'' was to be primarily filmed at the stadium, but the show was canceled before ever getting off the ground.  In 2004, it served as the home of the [[Florida Thunder]], the city's [[Pro Cricket]] team.  The facility hosted local youth and adult sports on the training grounds but the internal workings of the stadium such as bathrooms, electrical and plumbing had gone into disrepair.  The park was used for the City of Homestead's [[Fourth of July]] celebration until the [[Homestead-Miami Speedway]] took over the duties in 2010, attracting an exponentially larger crowd than ever before.

The facility was damaged again by 2017's [[Hurricane Irma]].&lt;ref name="scrap"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reichard |first1=Kevin |title=Homestead Sports Complex Slated for Scrap Heap |url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2018/07/01/homestead-sports-complex-slated-for-scrap-heap/ |accessdate=July 5, 2018 |work=Ballpark Digest |publisher=August Publications |date=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
After Hurricane Irma, the City Commission requested a feasibility study on the complex. Five of the six options in the study involve tearing down the ball park. The city solicited demolition bids. A final decision is pending.&lt;ref name="scrap" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3357">'''Initiative''' in a [[chess]] position belongs to the player who can make threats that cannot be ignored. He thus puts his opponent in the position of having to use his turns responding to threats rather than making his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chess.about.com/od/reference/g/bldefini.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506002514/http://chess.about.com/od/reference/g/bldefini.htm |archivedate=2006-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A player with the initiative will often seek to maneuver his pieces into more and more advantageous positions as he launches successive attacks.  The player who lacks the initiative may seek to regain it through {{chessgloss|counterattack}}.

==Discussion==
Due to moving first, [[White and Black in chess|White]] starts the game with the initiative, but it can be lost in the [[opening (chess)|opening]] by accepting a [[gambit]]. Players can also lose initiative by making unnecessary moves that allow the opponent to gain [[Tempo (chess)|tempo]], such as superfluous "preventive" moves intended to guard against certain actions by the opponent, that nonetheless require no specific response by them. The concept of tempo is closely tied to initiative, as players can acquire the initiative or buttress it by gaining a tempo.

The initiative is important in all phases of the game, but more important in the [[chess endgame|endgame]] than in the [[chess middlegame|middlegame]] and more important in the middlegame than in the [[chess opening|opening]] {{harvcol|Euwe|Meiden|1966|pp=xvii,xxii}}.  Having the initiative puts the opponent on the defensive.

[[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[Larry Evans]] considers four elements of chess: ''[[pawn structure]]'', ''force'' ({{chessgloss|material}}), ''{{chessgloss|space}}'' (controlling the {{chessgloss|center}} and [[chess piece|piece]] {{chessgloss|mobility}}), and ''time''.  Time is measured in [[tempo (chess)|tempos]].  Having a time advantage is having the initiative {{harvcol|Evans|1958|p=123}}.  The initiative should be kept as long as possible and only given up for another advantage {{harvcol|Capablanca|de Firmian|2006|pp=65–66}}.

'''Jetboard''' in [[Hydroflight sports|Hydroflight Sports]] is a device that uses water propulsion as its means of flying above the surface of any body of water.

In jetboarding the athlete is standing in wakeboard-style boots/bindings which are attached to a board or independent base plates with jets extending downward from under the feet.&lt;ref&gt;http://worldhydroflightassociation.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim in jetboarding is to perform tricks such as dolphin dives, spins and backflips (even multiples), and combinations of two or more tricks.

Competitive jetboarding began in 2012 with the first Flyboard World Cup, a freestyle trick jetboard competition in which athletes are critiqued by a panel of judges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h2romagazine.com/hydroflight-sports&lt;/ref&gt;

The world’s first open competitive event for hydroflight jetboards, Session One, was held at LTS Training school in Pompano Beach Florida on February 13-14th, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.x-jetpacks.com/session-one-overview/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jumping stilts''' or '''spring stilts''' are special [[stilts]] that allow the user to run, jump and perform various acrobatics. Spring stilts using fiberglass leaf springs were patented in the United States in 2004 under the trademark "PowerSkip", marketed for recreational and extreme sports use.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Böck (13 April 2004) {{US Patent|6719671}} "Device for helping a person to walk".&lt;/ref&gt; Spring stilts are often mostly made of [[aluminium]]. Using these stilts is also called "bocking" or "powerbocking", a corrupted version of the name of the stilts' inventor, Alexander Boeck. 

==Powerbocking==
The act of "bocking" or "powerbocking" includes jumping, running, and performing acrobatics with elastic-like [[Spring (device)|spring]]-loaded [[stilts]].&lt;ref name=Hom&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/26/AR2007102602492.html|title=A Giant Step for Mankind|publisher=The Washington Post | date=30 October 2007 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some it is an [[extreme sport]]; for others it is a form of exercise or even artistic expression.

The stilts are often referred to generically as bocks or powerbocks; as power stilts, jumping stilts, or spring stilts; or by their brand name.

==Description==
Each boot consists of a foot-plate with [[snowboard]] type bindings, rubber foot pad which is also commonly called a hoof, and a [[fibreglass]] [[leaf spring]]. Using only their weight, and few movements, the user is generally able to [[jumping|jump]] 3&amp;ndash;5&amp;nbsp;ft (1&amp;ndash;1.5 metres) off the ground and [[running|run]] up to 20&amp;nbsp;mph (32&amp;nbsp;km/h). They also give the ability to take up to 9-foot (2.7 metres) strides.&lt;ref name=Zebedee&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/health/dietfitness.html?in_article_id=420612|title=Zebedee Workout|publisher=Daily Mail | location=London | date=5 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumping stilts were used in the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympic games in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2bEAz2cpD8|title=Beijing 2008 Olympic Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brands==
They were originally patented by Alexander Böck, from Germany (European Patent EP 1 196 220 B1 on 2 July 2003, US Patent No. 6,719,671 B1 on 13 April 2004, both with a priority date of 20 July 1999), as "Powerskip".  Many people also use common brand names to refer to them generically.&lt;ref&gt;See introduction on the forum: [http://www.poweriserpages.com PoweriserPages.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Common brand names are 7 League Boots, Air-Trekkers, Powerizers, Pro-Jump, and Powerskips.

==Risks==
On 4 December 2010 Samuel Koch was heavily injured during the show ''[[Wetten, dass..?]]'' during a stunt where he attempted to jump over multiple moving cars in succession.

==Similar devices==
Though similar in appearance, powerbocking is not to be confused with the use of [[Mechanics of Oscar Pistorius' running blades|prosthetic devices]] such as those used by paralympic runner [[Oscar Pistorius]].

[[Moon shoes]] and [[Kangoo Jumps]] are earlier attempts at '''jumping shoes''' using a different technique. Some are still popular today.
[[Rocket boots]] were designed in the 1970s for the Russian Army, and use combustion pistons rather than springs for a similar effect.

Similar devices are attached to the boots of [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]] (the protagonist) in the ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' video game series for the purpose of surviving long falls, though such devices might not actually work in real life.

An English folklore figure, [[spring-heeled Jack]], has been conjectured by some investigators to have been a prankster using spring-loaded leaping aids as early as 1837.

Spring stilts using steel coil springs, an antecedent of the [[pogo stick]], were attempted in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Heerington (22 February 1881) {{US Patent|238042}} "Spring-stilt"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Yagn (21 October 1890) {{US Patent|438830}} "Apparatus for facilitating walking"&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Monmouth Oaks''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Thoroughbred horse race]] held annually at [[Monmouth Park Racetrack]] in [[Oceanport, New Jersey]] for three-year-old [[filly|fillies]]. Named for [[England|England's]] [[Epsom Oaks]], first run in 1779, the inaugural American edition took place in 1871. Originally raced over a distance of {{frac|1|1|2}} miles from 1871 through 1877, there was no race in 1878 but on its return the following year was modified to {{frac|1|1|4}} miles.

In 1891, the [[New Jersey Legislature]] began a move to ban [[parimutuel betting]] and the Oaks had to be moved to the [[Jerome Park Racetrack]] in [[The Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. With a legislated permanent ban, after the 1893 running the Monmouth Park Racetrack was shut down and the property sold. years. In 1946, Thoroughbred racing returned to a new Monmouth Park racing facility. The revived Monmouth Oaks was set at {{frac|1|1|16}} miles and in 1997 [[Blushing K. D.]] set the existing record for that distance at 1:41.80.

Over the years, the Oaks has been won by some of the best fillies in the United States including [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|U.S. Racing Hall of Fame]] inductees, [[Miss Woodford]] (1883), [[Firenze (horse)|Firenze]] (1887), [[Dark Mirage]] (1968), [[Gallant Bloom]] (1969) and [[Desert Vixen]] (1973).

It is currently a [[Graded stakes race|Grade III]] stakes race with a [[Purse distribution|purse]] of $100,000 divided 60% to the winning owner, 20% to second, 11% to third, 6% to fourth and 3% to fifth. There was no race held in 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8840">The '''National Football Foundation''' ('''NFF''') is a [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1947 with early leadership from [[General Douglas MacArthur]], longtime [[Army Black Knights football]] coach [[Earl Blaik]] and journalist [[Grantland Rice]].  Its mission is to promote and develop amateur [[American football]] on all levels throughout the United States and to cultivate leadership, sportsmanship, enthusiasm for competition, and the drive for academic excellence among America's youth.

In addition to supporting amateur football on the local level, the National Football Foundation also oversees the support, administration, and operation of the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].  Among its other programs and initiatives includes the facilitation of the Play It Smart program, which places a trained "academic coach" who turns football teams into learning teams in underserved high schools across the country, and the awarding of the [[William V. Campbell Trophy]] presented by [[HealthSouth Corporation]], referred to in many circles as the "Academic Heisman".  In spring 2007, the NFF launched the NFF Hampshire Honor Society, a recognition program for players who excel both on the field and in the classroom. Inductees must have been a starter in their final collegiate season and have earned a 3.2 cumulative [[grade point average|GPA]] for their undergraduate degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footballfoundation.com/news.php?id=1143 |title=NFF Announces Inaugural National Honor Society |publisher=National Football Foundation |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2007-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070821072136/http://www.footballfoundation.com/news.php?id=1143 |archivedate=2007-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation also tabulated and released the Bowl Championship Series Standings each Fall and hosts an Annual Awards Dinner in December at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]] in [[New York City]].

[[Archie Manning]], a former [[Ole Miss Rebels football]] [[All-American]] and member of the College Football Hall of Fame, serves as the current chairman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://footballfoundation.org/sports/2018/7/27/nff-officers.aspx|title=NFF Officers|website=footballfoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Steven J. Hatchell]], the former commissioner of the [[Big 12 Conference]] and executive director of the [[FedEx Orange Bowl]], serves as its current president. The foundation has 120 local chapters distributed among 48 states.  Since 1956, more than 100,000 volunteers have become members.

== National Scholar-Athlete Awards ==
Founded in 1959, the award is presented each season to the nation's top scholar-athletes for excellence in academics, athletics and leadership.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2468">The '''Oakbank Easter Racing Carnival''' is a [[horse-racing]] meeting held over two days by the Oakbank Racing Club at the [[Oakbank Racecourse]] located in the [[Adelaide Hills]] in [[South Australia]]. The carnival is a mixture of flat and jumping races with between two and four jumps races on day one and two feature jumping races on day two.

Day one is held on Easter Saturday and is one of the highest attended race days in Australia. The Von Doussa Steeplechase (named after founder [[Alfred von Doussa]]) takes place on day one and is a preliminary to the [[Great Eastern Steeplechase]] held on Easter Monday. A "classic" hurdle race takes place on Monday as does the feature flat race, the Onkaparinga Cup.

The meeting is conducted by the Oakbank Racing Club and is popular with families and groups. Although ostensibly a horse race meeting, Oakbank is an event in itself with carnival rides, picnics and other activities. Many families camp for the whole weekend in the paddocks adjacent to the track, and some have done so all their lives.

Patrons travelled by train from Adelaide to nearby [[Balhannah railway station]], {{convert|2|miles}} from the course, from 1884. When the [[Mount Pleasant railway line]] opened in 1918, a platform was constructed adjacent to the course, permitting special race trains to run direct to the course the following Easter. The line to Mount Pleasant closed on 3 March 1963, thus the race trains ran no more.&lt;ref&gt;'''''The Oakbank Race Trains''''' Callaghan, W.H. [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], August, 1995 pp211-221&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Shafie has been playing exclusively with the national team setup ever since graduating from Brunei's [[Brunei Sports School|Sports School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sports School thrash Temburong |url=http://www.bt.com.bn/local_sport/2009/05/16/sports_school_thrash_temburong|date=16 May 2009|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Brunei national under-21 football team|Brunei under-21]] side that was triumphant on home soil at the [[2012 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy]], starting three games out of six.&lt;ref name=hbt /&gt;

A year later, Shafie travelled to [[Thailand]] with the [[Brunei national under-19 football team|Brunei under-19s]] for the [[2014 AFC U-19 Championship qualification]], where they lost all three games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nat'l U-19s set for AFC meet|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2013/10/06/natl-u-19s-set-afc-meet|date=6 October 2013|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar story happened with the [[Brunei national under-23 football team|under-23s]] at the [[Football at the 2013 Southeast Asian Games|27th SEA Games football tournament]] in [[Myanmar]] two months later, where Shafie only played twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South East Asian Games 2013 (Nay Pyi Taw)|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/sea2013.html|date=18 June 2015|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shafie missed out on the [[2014 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy]] but returned with the under-23s for the [[2016 AFC U-23 Championship qualification]] held in [[Indonesia]] in late March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U-23s set for AFC tourney|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2015/02/04/u-23s-set-afc-tourney|date=4 February 2015|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=18 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418150440/http://bt.com.bn/sports-national/2015/02/04/u-23s-set-afc-tourney#|archive-date=18 April 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scoreless and goalless, the same team headed for the [[Football at the 2015 Southeast Asian Games|28th SEA Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manager calls for total commitment|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2015/05/26/manager-calls-total-commitment|date=26 May 2015|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=18 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923234208/http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2015/05/26/manager-calls-total-commitment#|archive-date=23 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shafie was ever-present although the Young Wasps lost all five of their games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brunei go down to M’sia|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/frontpage-sports-national/2015/06/09/brunei-go-down-m%E2%80%99sia|date=9 June 2015|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Shafie captained the under-23s for the [[2018 AFC U-23 Championship qualification]] that took place in [[Yangon]], [[Myanmar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brunei end AFC U-23 C’Ship qualifiers with loss to Singapore|url=https://www.brusports.com/2017/07/24/brunei-end-afc-u-23-cship-qualifiers-with-loss-to-singapore/|date=24 July 2017|publisher=BruSports News|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Young Wasps lost all three games. The same story happened at the [[2017 Southeast Asian Games|29th SEA Games]] held in [[Malaysia]] a month later, where ever-present Shafie and compatriots suffered four defeats out of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National football team end SEA Games campaign|url=https://borneobulletin.com.bn/national-football-team-end-sea-games-campaign/|date=24 August 2017|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climbing '''skins''' are strips that attach to the bottom of [[nordic skiing|nordic]], [[ski touring|alpine touring or randonnée]] [[ski]]s to help while ascending [[backcountry]] slopes. They are designed to be removed for skiing downhill. They are typically attached to the skis via a loop on the ski tip, a hook on the tail, and adhesive on the base of the skin. They are called skins because they resemble [[sealskin]], from which the first ski skins were made. They are typically made from [[nylon]] or [[mohair]] or a combination thereof, and are designed to let the ski slide forward on snow but not backward.&lt;ref&gt;

== History ==
Various ethnic groups living in the Arctic regions created a means of transportation across the ice and snow surfaces of their regions, with innovations such as the ski. Attuned to maximizing the use of their materials, one outcome of their innovation was the use of animal skins to gain traction in traveling. As these groups were nomadic, the technology of skis for transportation was integral to continual movement across the region, as well as in maximizing transportation speed while reducing energy expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Formenti |first1=Federico |display-authors=etal |title=Human Locomotion on Snow: Determinants of Economy and Speed of Skiing across the Ages |journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences |volume=272 |issue=1572 |year=2005 |pages=1561–1569 |jstor=30047725 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Snow Arena''' is an [[indoor ski slope]]  in [[Druskininkai]], [[Lithuania]]. It was opened on August 26, 2011.

It is one of the biggest indoor skiing slopes in the world, with the slope length of 460 m, width 50 m and height difference of 65.65 m and 150 m beginner slope. The indoor ski area is divided into two segments: [[terrain park]] and ski slope. A seasonal outdoor route of 640 m is also available when the average outdoor temperatures fall below +5°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snowarena.lt/lt/uzsiemimai/trasos |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917075430/http://www.snowarena.lt/lt/uzsiemimai/trasos |archivedate=2010-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow at Snow Arena is made by using [[PowderStar]] Series technology. Water and air are the only ingredients of the [[snow]] with no chemical or bacteriological additives used. The interior temperature of the hall, which is open all year round, is kept at a constant −2 to −4 °C (28.4 to 24.8 °F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snowarena.lt/en/apie_mus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210114456/http://www.snowarena.lt/en/apie_mus |archivedate=2014-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two ski lifts in the Snow Arena: a [[platter lift]] and a [[chair lift]]. There is also a [[Magic carpet (ski lift)]] for the beginner slope. 
Snow Arena offers ski rentals and lessons with the skiing school established at the arena, offers a wide range of programs for all abilities and offers group bookings for schools and businesses. It also has a small store that sells gloves, helmets and socks and offers a range of off-snow services, including four restaurants and two licensed bars.

It cost about €31 million to build this arena.

=== 19 September 1939: SS Scharnhorst ===
The Hochi Shimbun newspaper was mentioned in ''The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser'' on 20 September 1939.  The text reads: "Scharnhorst As Raider? Tokio, Sept. 19. A REPORT that the Norddeut- scher Lloyd liner Scharnhorst. now at Kobe, is being; converted into an armed raider appears in the Hochi Shimbun. The paper adds the liner is surrounded by launches and there is much fuss and bustle aboard. This is taken by some observers as meaning she is being refitted as an armed vessel - Reuter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/singfreepressb19390920-1.2.3?ST=1&amp;AT=filter&amp;K=Scharnhorst&amp;KA=Scharnhorst&amp;DF=&amp;DT=&amp;Display=0&amp;AO=false&amp;NPT=&amp;L=&amp;CTA=&amp;NID=singfreepressb&amp;CT=&amp;WC=&amp;YR=&amp;QT=scharnhorst&amp;oref=article|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg|title=Scharnhorst As Raider?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10859">A '''television timeout''' (alternately '''TV timeout''' or '''media timeout''') is a break in a televised live event for the purpose of [[television]] broadcasting. This allows commercial broadcasters to take an [[television commercial|advertising break]], or issue their required hourly [[station identification]], without causing viewers to miss part of the action.

Programs making use of timeouts are usually [[Broadcasting of sports events|live-action sporting events]]. However, other live programs occasionally make use of timeouts for advertising purposes, such as the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].

==Use by sport==
* [[American football]] ([[National Football League|NFL]]): The [[National Football League]] requires twenty commercial breaks per game, with ten in each half. (Exceptions to this are overtime periods, which have none.) These breaks run either a minute, or two minutes in length. Of the ten commercial breaks per half, two are mandatory: at the end of the first or third quarter, and at the two-minute warning for the end of the half. The remaining eight breaks are optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/25/business/media/25iht-espn.html |title=ESPN Positions Itself to Take on Europe |author=Samual Apt |newspaper=[[The New York Times International Edition|The International Herald Tribune]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=January 25, 2010 |accessdate=April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The timeouts can be applied after [[field goal (football)|field goal]] tries, conversion attempts for both [[conversion (gridiron football)|one]] and [[two-point conversion|two]] points following [[touchdown]]s, changes in possession either by [[Punt (gridiron football)|punts]] or [[turnover (football)|turnovers]], and [[kickoff (American football)|kickoffs]] (except for the ones that start each half, or are within the last five minutes). The breaks are also called during stoppages due to injury, [[instant replay in American and Canadian football|instant replay challenges]], when either of the participating teams uses one of its set of timeouts, and if the network needs to catch up on its commercial advertisement schedule. The arrangement for [[college football]] contests is the same, except for the absence of the two-minute warning.
* [[Baseball]]: No formal television timeout, but the interval between the end of a half-[[Inning (baseball)|inning]] is set between two and three minutes for televised games, and during pitching changes that happen in the middle of an inning for the pitcher to warm up.
* [[Basketball]]
** [[College basketball|College]] men: At the first [[dead ball]] after 4-minute intervals (beyond the 16:00, 12:00, 8:00 and 4:00 minute mark of each half).&lt;ref name=Voepel&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/womens-college-basketball/story/_/id/9259849/ncaa-women-basketball-panel-looks-add-10-second-backcourt-rule |title=Panel recommends 10-second rule |first=Mechelle |last=Voepel |publisher=''[[ESPN.com]]'' |date=May 9, 2013 |accessdate=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the first 30-second team timeout in the second half is expanded to a television timeout.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} If free throws are to be shot, a timeout is taken first.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Effective with the [[2015–16 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2015–16 season]], when a team calls a timeout within the 30-second window before the next scheduled TV timeout break, the called timeout takes the place of the scheduled TV timeout.&lt;ref name="2015 NCAA men's changes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/13037928/ncaa-announces-rule-changes-2015-16-including-30-second-shot-clock-fewer-outs |title=Shorter shot clock, fewer timeouts among changes coming in 2015-16 |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=June 8, 2015 |accessdate=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar rule in the NBA is used when a 20-second timeout is called but a team's mandatory timeout point has been reached.&lt;ref name=Voepel/&gt;
** College women and FIBA: Media timeouts are taken at the first dead ball after the 5:00 mark in each quarter. Any called timeout before the 5-minute mark of a quarter becomes the media timeout.  Organisers have the option in FIBA play to implement a television timeout at the next dead ball following the same point.&lt;ref name="2015 NCAA women's changes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/womens-college-basketball/story/_/id/13038918/ncaa-approves-change-four-quarters-women-basketball |title=NCAA panel approves women's basketball rules changes |agency=Associated Press |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=June 8, 2015 |accessdate=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]: There must be two timeouts in each quarter. In each quarter, if no team has called a timeout before the 6:59 mark, a timeout is charged to the home team, and if no subsequent timeout is taken prior to the 2:59 mark, a timeout is charged to the team not previously charged with a timeout. The first and second timeouts in each quarter are two minutes 45 seconds for locally televised games, and three minutes 15 seconds for nationally televised games. Other timeouts in a quarter are one minute 15 seconds in length. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NBA Rule Book 2017{{endash}}2018 |url=https://turnernbahangtime.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/2017-18-nba-rule-book.pdf |page=22 |publisher=[[National Basketball Association]] |accessdate=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bowling]]: Varies.{{vague|date=July 2012}} 
* [[Cricket]]:  Generally at the end of some [[overs]] as the field switches around, when a [[wicket]] falls, during drinks breaks and during intervals. In the [[2009 Indian Premier League|2009 season]] of the [[Indian Premier League]] of [[Twenty20]] [[cricket]], the halfway point of each [[innings]] contained a seven-and-a-half minute stoppage of play, two-thirds of which were devoted to advertising time.&lt;ref name=guardian-ipltimeout&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian Premier League introduces compulsory time-outs during matches|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/apr/16/indian-premier-league-cricket|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=4 April 2013|location=London|first=Lawrence|last=Booth|date=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After complaints by viewers and players (criticizing its use as an extended commercial break, and for breaking the flow of the game), these breaks were replaced in the following year by two compulsory "strategic timeouts" of two-and-a-half minutes per innings. One must be taken by the bowling team between the 6th to 10th overs, and the batting team between the 11th to 16th overs.&lt;ref name=ipl3-timeout&gt;{{cite news|title=IPL 3 to start on March 12 in Hyderabad|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-08-11/top-stories/28156697_1_ipl-chairman-lalit-modi-ipl-ii-deccan-chargers|publisher=The Times of India|accessdate=4 April 2013|date=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cricketcountry-strategic&gt;{{cite web|title="Strategic time out" to rake in money|url=http://www.cricketcountry.com/cricket-articles/-Strategic-time-out-to-rake-in-money/2896|publisher=Cricket Country|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Curling]]: at the conclusion of each end. The game generally resumes before the commercial break ends, so when the broadcast comes back on a few rocks will have already been thrown.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* [[Ice hockey]]
** [[National Hockey League|NHL]]: Commercial time-outs are taken after 4-minute intervals at the first stoppages of play after the 14:00, 10:00 and 6:00 marks in each period when both teams are at even strength. However, there are no commercial time-outs after a goal, after an icing, during a power-play, during the last 30 seconds of the first and second period or last two minutes of the third period.  Also, there must be at least one minute of play between commercial time-outs and an effort must be done to identify the situations where a video review might happen in order to NOT go into a commercial time-out. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nhlofficials.com/articles/view/55 |title=Week 20 - Need a Break? |website=www.nhlofficials.com |date=February 23, 2015 |access-date=April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[NHL outdoor games|outdoor games]], a hard TV timeout is called at the 10:00 mark of the third period, and play is immediately stopped (as they need to change ends of the ice to ensure fairness). Additionally there are no timeouts, commercial or team, granted during a shootout. Due to these restrictions, it is  possible that not all of the scheduled breaks are taken, in which case sometimes a network will take a timeout at the conclusion of the game to make up for it before signing off on the broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.kuklaskorner.com/index.php/rbh/comments/nhl_to_implement_another_rule_change_for_icing/ | title=NHL to implement another rule change for icing | publisher=kuklaskorner.com | date=November 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]], television timeouts are taken only in the following situations:
***In the preseason and the regular season, between the end of the overtime period and the beginning of the shootout. No television timeouts are taken during the overtime period.
***In the postseason, at the first stoppage of play after the halfway point in the overtime period.
*[[Motorsports]]: Most races are unable to accommodate television timeouts, but certain events, such as the NASCAR [[Camping World Truck Series]], events are structured with a safety car after 20 minutes of green flag action to help inexperienced drivers acclimate themselves with pit stops (full green flag pit stops are discouraged in order to help younger drivers gain experience with live pit stops in a more controlled environment).  In order to alleviate the lack of television timeout periods, technology such as [[Side-By-Side (graphic)|Side-By-Side]] has been introduced.  During the Sprint All-Star Race, commercials are only taken between periods after the pit stop, or during safety car situations.
* [[Tennis]]: during the break after odd-numbered games when players change ends.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* [[Volleyball]] and [[beach volleyball]]: in volleyball games governed by [[Fédération Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]], television timeouts are referred to as [[Technical time-out (volleyball)|technical time-outs]] and occur during each non-[[tie-break]]ing set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Official Volleyball Rules|year= 2005| url = http://www.fivb.org/en/volleyball/Rules/Rules.htm | work = [http://www.fivb.org/ FIVB.org] | publisher= [[Fédération Internationale de Volleyball]] | accessdate = 2008-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trampolino Olimpico Italia''' is a [[ski jump]]ing hill (K90), built in 1955 in [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], [[Italy]]. It was the site of the [[ski jumping]], [[Nordic combination|Nordic combined]] (K90/15.0) and team events for the [[1956 Winter Olympics]]. The Nordic combined event used a shorter in-run to allow average jumps between 60 and 70 meters while the upper starting points on the in-run were calculated to allow jumps of 70 to 80 meters. The 1956 profile had a safety limit of 14.5 m beyond the critical point of 72 m. (transition from the landing slope curve to the out-run begins at a distance of 86.5 m).&lt;ref name="italia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cortina 1956 Olympic Winter Games Report - (PDF) page 134, 135|url=http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1956/orw1956.pdf|publisher=la84.org|accessdate=December 4, 2013|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among many national and international competitions starting with the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1927|1927 World Championships]], was the inauguration of the [[FIS Ski Jumping World Cup]] in [[1979–80 FIS Ski Jumping World Cup|1979]]. Since the venue lost its FIS-certification in 1990,&lt;ref name="records"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ski Jumping Hill Archive - Cortina d'Ampezzo|url=http://www.skisprungschanzen.com/EN/Ski+Jumps/ITA-Italy/Cortina+d%60Ampezzo/0330/|publisher=skisprungschanzen.com|accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the installation lies dormant. In its day, the Cortina Ski Jumping hill was regarded as one of the most innovative and still today as one of the most architecturally beautiful examples still in existence. The stadium holds a maximum of 40,000 spectators in the arena and an additional 10.000 in the stands on each side of the hill.

It was featured in a scene in the 1981 James Bond film ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]''.

==History==
2.5&amp;nbsp;km (2&amp;nbsp;mi) from Cortina, near Zuel, the "Italia" ski jumping hill (Trampolino Olimpico Italia) began its life in 1923 as the "Franchetti" Jump. That year, the Dolomites Sports Club, with a grant from Baron Carlo Franchetti and funds from the hotel owners of Cortina, constructed the first ski jumping installation with a modest wooden in-run platform which allowed jumps up to 40 meters.

Timeline:

*1923 - 40 meter hill built with a modest wooden in-run structure.
*1924 - Ski jumpers Greising and Schatz of Innsbruck (Austria), established the first hill record of 42 m.
*1926 - First alterations to increase the length of the jump to 52 m. New hill record by Tore Edmann (Sweden) of 54 m.
*1927 - The first Ski Jumping World Championships at Cortina.
*1939 - Completely demolished due to new F.I.S. technical requirements for the up-coming 1941 F.I.S contests.
*1940 - New construction with a 48 m. in-run tower, permitting jumps of 75 m. The new venue is named "Italia".&lt;ref name="italia"/&gt;
*1941 - F.I.S. World Championships. First hill record by Sepp Weiler (Germany) of 76 m.&lt;ref name="records"/&gt;
*1952 - Last hill record by Ossi Laaksonen (Finland) of 78 m.&lt;ref name="records"/&gt;
*1955 - Again completely demolished and re-built the same year due to the technical requirements for the up-coming 1956 Olympic games.
*1956 - The VII Olympic Winter Games see the most advanced modern ski jumping installation of the era. Hill record by Antti Hyvärinen of 84 m.&lt;ref name="records"/&gt;
*1979 - First round of the inaugural Ski Jumping World Cup (revisited in 1981, 1982, 1984 and 1985).
*1981 - Last hill record of the Olympic Italia by Roger Ruud (Norway) of 92 m.&lt;ref name="records"/&gt;
*1990 - The "Italia" loses its F.I.S. certification due to financial constraints.&lt;ref name="records"/&gt;
