'''590 Madison Avenue''' also known as the '''IBM Building''', is a {{convert|603|ft|m}} tall skyscraper at the corner of [[57th Street (Manhattan)|East 57th Street]] and Madison Avenue in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. It was completed in 1983 and has 41 floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=590 Madison Avenue|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=590madisonavenuenue-newyorkcity-ny-usa|work=Emporis|accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=590 Madison Avenue |url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=876 |publisher=SkyscraperPage.com |accessdate=2009-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124070709/http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=876 |archivedate=2007-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building cost US$10 million, has {{convert|93592|m2|sqft}} of floor area, has 24 elevators, and is the 89th tallest building in New York.

IBM sold the tower to Odyssey in 1994. As of December 2007, 98% of the building is leased.

== History ==
The world headquarters of IBM had been in a previous 20-story building on this site which opened in January 1938.&lt;ref name="world hq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/vintage/vintage_4506VV2045.html |title=IBM Archives: World Headquarters, N.Y. City |publisher=IBM Archives |accessdate=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM moved its headquarters to [[Armonk, New York]] in 1964&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, Marek; [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/24/nyregion/county-lines-onward-in-armonk.html ''County Lines: Onward in Armonk''], New York Times, February 24, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; but still needed a facility in New York City. In 1973, the construction of a new IBM building to replace the existing one was permitted by New York City. Its plan included square footage exceeded the legal limitation of allowable floor area but it was accepted because of the bonus for providing benefits of public open space. The original building was demolished starting in 1977.&lt;ref name="world hq" /&gt; The present building was completed in 1983. It contained public open space as part of a 1961 amendment to the [[1916 Zoning Resolution]], which allowed architects to create buildings with more square footage if they contained public open spaces.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Edward Larrabee Barnes, Architect|last = Larrabee Barnes|first = Edward|publisher = Rizzoli International Publications|year = 1994|pages = 158–165|isbn = 9780847818228 | oclc = 860607981|at = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was used by IBM as its Eastern regional headquarters until it was sold to Odyssey in 1994. In following year, the new owner applied to the City Planning Commission for the modification proposal of its atrium. After hearing of arguments for and against the proposal, the public space was altered. Although there were some changes in the atrium such as the removal of a few bamboo trees, additional chairs, and displays of sculpture, it still kept the designation as an oasis in the city. The building and its atrium have been known as one of the most monumental buildings and popular open spaces in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Privately Owned Public Space|last = Wiley|first = John|publisher = The New York City Department of City Planning, The Municipal Society Art of New York|year = 2000|origyear = |authorlink = |pages = 173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
590 Madison Avenue is an office building designed by [[Edward Larrabee Barnes]]. It was originally owned by [[IBM]] and thus called the "IBM Building".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.showcase.com/property/590-Madison-Avenue/New-York/New-York/157103|title=590 Madison Avenue - IBM Bldg|work=Showcase|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower was completed in 1983, and was used by numerous IBM branch offices until it was sold to Odyssey in 1994. The building is still named for IBM, and the global technology firm remains a major tenant. The 41-story building's height reaches 603 feet (184 m). It has a unique wedge shape and an adjacent, [[privately owned public space]] covered by a glass structure, which contains resting chairs, tables, and bamboo trees, and is used for pedestrian circulation, resting, amenities, art displays and cultural events.

=== Site ===
[[File:IBM Building atrium by Matthew Bisanz.jpg|thumb|Atrium containing public space|left]]
The building is located on the west side of Madison Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets. The [[Trump Tower|Trump Towe]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r, and the [[550 Madison Avenue|Sony Building]], nearby, also have public spaces. This context strongly influenced the design of the building. Its wedge shape was intended to avoid too much volume of the building toward 56th Street, which is a relatively narrow street. Instead, Barnes faced the building toward 57th Street and Madison Avenue directly without setback. The space saved by cutting the South West corner of the building allowed the creation of open space at ground level. The open space is connected to 5th Avenue through the atrium in the Trump Tower. Also, a pedestrian arcade is across the block and creates circulation from 57th Street through 56th Street to the Sony Building. The open space of the IBM building not only provides the space to escape from density but also activates the circulation in this area.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title =none |date= May 1984|journal = Architectural Record|volume = 172|issue = 6|page = 149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Form and use ===
The building was designed as a unique wedge shape, having the South West corner cut from the rectangular box. The volume can be seen differently from different angles, sometimes slender, sometimes gigantic. The entrance of the building provides spectacle and openness to the street and welcoming visitors. Of the building's 41 stories, most are assigned to office use. At ground level, some retail stores face 57th Street. The building occupies only 40 percent of the property and the rest of the square footage is assigned to public open space. The space is filled with a series of amenities such as food and drink kiosks, tables and chairs, receptacles, etc. Green bamboo trees installed in the space celebrate the serenity of an indoor garden. Also, artwork is displayed inside to entertain visitors. This space is occasionally used for special events.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Planning and Zoning New York City.|first = Todd|last = W. Bressi|publisher = Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey|year = 1993|pages = 173–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;[[File:IBM Building by Matthew Bisanz.jpg|left|thumb|Side view facing north]]
=== Material and structure ===
The exterior of the building is covered by gray green glass and polished granite. The moderately reflective surface keeps changing its texture depending on the angle and the light. The use of transparent glass for the public space emphasizes its openness and lets plenty of sunlight in. The wedge shaped building was a challenge in terms of structure because its shape caused more wind load than that to conventional box shaped skyscrapers. After wind tunnel tests, the original structural design was revised because of the wind load. The frames around the elevator shafts remained as they were, with diagonal frames added. Columns on the perimeter of the building were moved closer by half and the spandrel beams were strengthened. Surprisingly, after redesign of the structure, the total amount of steel required decreased. Another interesting challenge in the structure's design was the cantilevered entrance. The challenge was not how to support the load above, but how to keep the stability of the building. Using stronger and bigger columns for the base solved this problem.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:adbusters talkingrainforest.jpg|thumb|Adbusters' first uncommercial]]

Adbusters was founded in 1989 by [[Kalle Lasn]] and Bill Schmalz, a duo of award-winning documentary filmmakers living in Vancouver. Since the early 1980s, Lasn had been making films that explored the spiritual and cultural lessons the West could learn from the Japanese experience with capitalism.

In 1988, the ''British Columbia Council of Forest Industries,'' the "voice" of the logging industry, was facing tremendous public pressure from a growing environmentalist movement. The logging industry fought back with a [[television ad]] campaign called "Forests Forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAzlAu3sK3A |title=Forests Forever Ad (1988) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2009-06-19 |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an early example of [[greenwashing]]: shots of happy children, workers and animals with a kindly, trustworthy sounding narrator who assured the public that the logging industry was protecting the forest.

Lasn and Shmalz, outraged by the use of the public airwaves to deliver what they felt was deceptive anti-environmentalist propaganda,  responded by producing the "Talking Rainforest"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49mUeTWGWBE |title=Adbusters - Talking Forest |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2012-11-07 |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; anti-ad in which an old-growth tree explains to a sapling that "a tree farm is not a forest." But the duo proved to be unable to buy airtime on the same stations that had aired the forest-industry ad.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} According to a former Adbusters employee, "The CBC's reaction to the proposed television commercial created the real flash point for the Media Foundation. It seemed that Lasn and Schmaltz's commercial was too controversial to air on the CBC. An environmental message that challenged the large forestry companies was considered 'advocacy advertising' and was disallowed, even though the 'informational' messages that glorified clearcutting were OK."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010222222933/http://www.evolutionzone.com/kulturezone/futurec/culture.jammers.manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation was born out of their belief that citizens do not have the same access to the information flows as corporations. One of the foundation's key campaigns continues to be the Media Carta,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000817064152/http://adbusters.org/campaigns/mediacarta/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; a "movement to enshrine The Right to Communicate in the constitutions of all free nations, and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."

The foundation notes that concern over the flow of information goes beyond the desire to protect democratic transparency, freedom of speech or the public's access to the airwaves. Although it supports these causes, the foundation instead situates the battle of the mind at the center of its political agenda. Fighting to counter pro-consumerist advertising is done not as a means to an end, but as the end in itself. This shift in emphasis is a crucial element of mental environmentalism.

==Mental environmentalism==
The subtitle of ''Adbusters'' magazine is "The Journal of the Mental Environment."

In a 1996 interview, [[Kalle Lasn]] explained the foundation's goal:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What we're trying to do is pioneer a new form of social activism using all the power of the mass media to sell ideas, rather than products. We're motivated by a kind of 'greenthink' that comes from the environmental movement and isn't mired in the old ideology of the left and right. Instead, we take the environmental ethic into the mental ethic, trying to clean up the toxic areas of our minds.

You can't recycle and be a good environmental citizen, then watch four hours of television and get consumption messages pumped at you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jim |last=Motavalli |date=30 April 1996 |title=Cultural Jammin' |url=http://www.emagazine.com/magazine-archive/cultural-jammin |journal=[[E - The Environmental Magazine]] |volume=7 |issue=3 |page=41 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923235938/http://www.emagazine.com/magazine-archive/cultural-jammin |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Issues==

===Anti-advertising===
Adbusters describes itself as anti-advertising: it blames advertising for playing a central role in creating and maintaining consumer culture. This argument is based on the belief that the advertising industry goes to great effort and expense to associate desire and identity with commodities.  Adbusters believes that advertising has unjustly "colonized" public, discursive and psychic spaces, by appearing in movies, sports and even schools, so as to permeate modern culture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  Adbusters's stated goals include combating the negative effects of advertising and empowering its readers to regain control of culture, encouraging them to ask "Are we consumers and citizens?"&lt;ref&gt;[Marnie W. Curry-Tash, "The Politics of Teleliteracy and Adbusting in the Classroom", ''English Journal'' 87(1), 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ''Adbusters'' concludes that advertising conditions people to look to external sources, to define their own personal identities, the magazine advocates a "natural and authentic self apart from the consumer society".&lt;ref&gt;[ Joseph D. Rumbo, "Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of Adbusters", ''Psychology and Marketing'', Vol.19(2), February 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;  The magazine aims to provoke anti-consumerist feelings. By juxtaposing text and images, the magazine attempts to create a means of raising awareness and getting its message out to people that is both aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/gcp/pdf/culturejamsandmemewarfare.pdf |title="Culture Jams and Meme Warfare: Kalle Lasn, Adbusters, and media activism", Wendi Pickerel, Helena Jorgensen, and Lance Bennett, 19 April 2002 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activism also takes many other forms such as corporate boycotts and ‘art as protest', often incorporating humor.  This includes  billboard modifications, [[google bombing]], [[flash mobs]] and fake parking tickets for [[SUVs]].  A popular example of cultural jamming is the distortion of Tiger Woods' smile into the form of the Nike swoosh, calling viewers to question how they view Woods' persona as a product.  Adbusters calls it "trickle up" activism, and encourages its readers to do these activities by honoring culture jamming work in the magazine. In the September/October 2001 "Graphic Anarchy" issue, Adbusters were culture jammed themselves in a manner of speaking: they hailed the work of Swiss graphic designer [[Ernst Bettler]] as "one of the greatest design interventions on record", unaware that Bettler's story was an elaborate [[hoax]].

===Media Carta===
"Media Carta" is a charter challenging the corporate control of the public airwaves and means of communication. The goal is to "make the public airwaves truly public, and not just a corporate domain."&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu" /&gt;  Over 30,000 people have signed the document {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} voicing their desire to reclaim the public space.
On 13 September 2004, Adbusters filed a lawsuit against six major Canadian television broadcasters (including [[CanWest Global Communications|CanWest Global]], [[Bell Globemedia]], [[CHUM Limited|CHUM Ltd.]], and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]) for refusing to air Adbusters videos in the television commercial spots that Adbusters attempted to purchase. Most broadcasters refused the commercials, fearing the ads would upset other advertisers as well as violate business principles by "contaminating the purity of media environments designed exclusively for communicating commercial messages".&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu" /&gt; The lawsuit claims that Adbusters' [[freedom of expression]] was unjustly limited by the refusals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/09/15/adbusters040915.html |publisher=[[CBC News]] |title=Adbusters Takes Canadian TV Networks to Court |date=15 September 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206041611/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/09/15/adbusters040915.html |archivedate=6 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adbusters believes the public deserves a right to be presented with viewpoints that differ from the standard.  Under Section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, television is a public space allowing ordinary citizens to possess the same rights as advertising agencies and corporations to purchase 30 seconds of airtime from major broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Adbusters-Media-Foundation-971292.html "Adbusters Wins Legal Victory in Ongoing Case Against the CBC and CanWest", Marketwire.com, 6 April 2009] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There has been talk that if Adbusters wins in Canadian court, they will file similar lawsuits against major U.S. broadcasters that also refused the [[Advertising|advertisements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satyamag.com/may05/lasn.html |title=Satya May 2005: Interview with Kalle Lasn of Adbusters |publisher=Satyamag.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[CNN]] is the only network that has allowed several of the foundation's commercials to run.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Legal action===
On 3 April 2009, the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] unanimously overturned a [[Supreme Court of British Columbia|BC Supreme Court]] ruling that had dismissed the case in February 2008.  The court granted Adbusters the ability to sue the Canadian Broadcasting Company and CanWest Global, the corporations that originally refused to air the anti-car ad "Autosaurus". The ruling represents a victory for Adbusters, but it is the first step of their intended goal, essentially opening the door for future legal action against the media conglomerates.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  [[Kalle Lasn]] declared the ruling a success and said, "After twenty years of legal struggle, the courts have finally given us permission to take on the media corporations and hold them up to public scrutiny."&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, Fiona (6 April 2009).  [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090406.wads0406/BNStory/National/home, Fiona Morrow, "Adbusters Wins Right To Sue Broadcasters over TV Ads"] ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital Detox Week===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Adbusters DigitalDetox.jpg|thumb|250px|Campaign logo for Digital Detox Week {{deletable image-caption|Friday, 4 January 2013}}]] --&gt;
In April 2009, the foundation transformed [[TV Turnoff Week]] into [[Digital Detox Week]], encouraging citizens to spend seven days "unplugged" without any of electronic devices such as video-game systems and computers.

===One Flag===
The "One Flag" competition encouraged readers to create a flag that symbolized "[[global citizenship]]", without using language or commonly known symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adbusters.org/about/adbusters |title=#118 - Adbusters &amp;#124; Journal of the mental environment |publisher=Adbusters |date=2015-02-17 |accessdate=2017-01-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031172500/http://www.adbusters.org/about/adbusters |archive-date=31 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==
===Culture jamming===
[[File:American Corporate Flag.svg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;!-- vector version of the --&gt;American Corporate Flag]]
[[Culture jamming]] is the primary means through which Adbusters challenges consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;Lasn, Kalle (2000). Culture Jam, New York: Quill.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was described by [[Joseph Heath]] and Andrew Potter in their book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'' as "the flagship publication of the culture jamming movement."&lt;ref name="rebel"&gt;[[Joseph Heath|Heath, Joseph]] and Potter, Andrew. ''[[The Rebel Sell]]''. Harper Perennial, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Culture jamming is heavily influenced by the [[Situationist International]] and the tactic of ''[[détournement]]''. The goal is to interrupt the normal consumerist experience in order to reveal the underlying ideology of an advertisement, media message, or consumer artifact. Adbusters believe large corporations control mainstream media and the flow of information, and culture jamming aims to challenge this as a form of protest. The term "jam" contains more than one meaning, including improvising, by re-situating an image or idea already in existence, and interrupting, by attempting to stop the workings of a machine.&lt;ref name="1 April 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cordweekly.com/cordweekly/news?news_id=2787 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410234323/http://cordweekly.com/cordweekly/news?news_id=2787 |archivedate=10 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As already noted, the foundation's  approach to culture jamming has its roots in the activities of the [[situationists]] and in particular their concept of ''détournement''. This involves the "turning around" of received messages so that they communicate meanings at variance with their original intention. Situationists argue that consumerism creates "a limitless artificiality", blurring the lines of reality and detracting from the essence of human experience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  In the "culture jamming" context, ''détournement'' means taking symbols, logos and slogans that are considered to be the vehicles upon which the "dominant discourse" of "late capitalism" is communicated and changing them&amp;nbsp;– frequently in significant but minor ways&amp;nbsp;– to subvert the "monologue of the ruling order" [Debord].

The foundation's activism links grassroots efforts with environmental and social concerns, hoping followers will "reconstruct [their] self through nonconsumption strategies."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/mar.10006 |title=Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of ''Adbusters'' |year=2002 | author = Rumbo, Joseph D. |journal=Psychology and Marketing |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=127–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The foundation is particularly well known for its [[culture jamming]] campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author = Willan, Claude |title=We're All Borf in the End |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/22/AR2005072202231_pf.html |work=The Washington Post |date= 24 July 2005 |accessdate=20 November 2007 |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the magazine often features photographs of politically motivated [[billboard]] or advertisement [[vandalism]] sent in by readers. The campaigns attempt to remove people from the "isolated reality of consumer comforts".&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu" /&gt;

===Blackspot Shoes campaign===
In 2004, the foundation began selling [[vegan]], indy shoes. The name and logo are "open-source";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/aboutblackspot.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522105440/http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/aboutblackspot.php |archivedate=22 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, unencumbered by private trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php# ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720081744/http://www.adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php |date=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to each pair was a "Rethink the Cool" leaflet, inviting wearers to join a movement, and two spots&amp;nbsp;– one for drawing their own logos and another on the toe for "kicking corporate ass."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://veganline.com/rethinkthecool.htm |title=Rethink the Cool - from Adbusters |website=Veganline.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three versions of the Blackspot Sneaker.  The V1 is designed to resemble the [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]-owned [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]] [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]] (Nike bought Converse in 2003).&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Aitch, Iain |title=Kicking against the system |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/politics/article82640.ece |work=The Independent |date=15 December 2003 |accessdate=20 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206133717/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/politics/article82640.ece |archivedate=6 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a V1 in "fiery red."

The V2 is designed by Canadian shoe designer [[John Fluevog]]. It is made from organic [[hemp]] and [[recycled]] car tires.

After an extensive search for [[anti-sweatshop movement|anti-sweatshop]] manufacturers around the world, Adbusters found a small union shop in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720081744/http://www.adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php |archivedate=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of more than twenty-five thousand pairs&lt;ref name="adbusters.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php |title=Blackspot – Blackspot Shoes |publisher=Adbusters.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720081744/http://www.adbusters.org/metas/corpo/blackspotshoes/info.php |archivedate=20 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; through an alternative distribution network is an example of Western consumer activism marketing.&lt;ref name="adbusters.org" /&gt;

Adbusters describes its goals vis-à-vis Blackspot as follows:

{{quote|Blackspot shoes is our experiment with grassroots capitalism. After spending many years railing against the practices of megacorporations like McDonalds, Starbucks and Nike, we wanted to prove that running an ethical, environmentally responsible business is possible ... and that taking market share away from megacorporations is better than whining about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Support + Subscribe | work = Adbusters.org | url = http://www.adbusters.org/support_subscribe | accessdate = 20 May 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120519224410/http://www.adbusters.org/support_subscribe | archivedate = 19 May 2012 | df = dmy-all }} Text 'hidden' under the "Why do we sell?" tab.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Reception====
Heath and Potter's ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'', which is critical of Adbusters, claimed that the blackspot shoe's existence proves that "no rational person could possibly believe that there is any tension between 'mainstream' and 'alternative' culture."&lt;ref name="rebel" /&gt;

In the June 2008 cover story of ''[[Businessweek|BusinessWeek Small Business Magazine]]'', the Blackspot campaign was among three profiled in a piece focusing on "antipreneurs." Two advertising executives were asked to review the campaign for the article's "Ask the Experts" sidebar.  Brian Martin of ''Brand Connections'' and Dave Weaver of [[TM Advertising]] both gave the campaign favorable reviews.

Martin noted that Blackspot was effectively telling consumers, "We know we are marketing to you, and you are as good as we are at this, and your opinion matters," while Weaver stated that "This is not a call to sales of the shoe so much as it is a call to participate in the community of Adbusters by buying the shoe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Meet the Antipreneurs | date = June–July 2008 |publisher = businessweek.com | url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_66/s0806039879656.htm?chan=search | accessdate =31 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2011, Adbusters Foundation proposed a peaceful occupation of Wall Street to protest corporate influence on democracy, a growing disparity in wealth, and the absence of legal repercussions behind the recent global financial crisis.&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Andrew|title=Adbusters sparks Wall Street protest Vancouver-based activists behind street actions in the U.S|url=http://www.vancourier.com/Adbusters+sparks+Wall+Street+protest/5466332/story.html|publisher=The Vancouver Courier|date=27 September 2011|accessdate=30 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AIbOo25w?url=http://www.vancourier.com/Adbusters+sparks+Wall+Street+protest/5466332/story.html|archivedate=30 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They sought to combine the symbolic location of the 2011 protests in [[Tahrir Square#2011 Egyptian Revolution|Tahrir Square]] with the [[consensus decision making]] of the [[2011 Spanish protests]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shira-lazar/micah-white-adbusters-_b_996931.html Sira Lazar "Occupy Wall Street: Interview With Micah White From Adbusters"], Huffington Post, 7 October 2011, at 3:40 in interview&lt;/ref&gt; Adbusters' senior editor [[Micah M.

While the movement was started by Adbusters, the group does not control the movement, and it has since [[Occupy movement|grown worldwide]].

==Criticisms==
===Commercial style===
The foundation has been criticized for having a style and form that are too similar to the media and commercial product that adbusters attack, that its high gloss design makes the magazine too expensive, and that a style over substance approach is used to mask sub-par content.&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, Carrie. "[http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/9/adbusters.htm Culture Jamming (tm): Brought To You By Adbusters] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050825220611/http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/9/adbusters.htm |date=25 August 2005 }}." ''[[Stay Free!]]''. Retrieved 13 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heath and Potter posit that the more alternative or [[subversion|subversive]] the foundation feels, the more appealing the Blackspot sneaker will become to the mainstream market. They believe consumers seek exclusivity and social distinction and have argued that the mainstream market seeks the very same brand of individuality that the foundation promotes; thus they see the foundation as promoting capitalist values.&lt;ref name="rebel" /&gt;

The Blackspot Shoes campaign has stirred heated debate, as Adbusters admits to using the same marketing technique which it denounces other companies for using by originally purchasing much advertising space for the shoe.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

===Legal issues===
Adbusters launched a legal challenge in 1995. A second in 2004 was against CBC, CTV, CanWest and CHUM, for refusing to air anti-consumerism commercials, therefore infringing on the staff's freedom of speech.&lt;ref name="Friesen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Friesen|first=Joe|title=Adbusters sing networks for not airing its TV spots|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=15 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, a CHUM representative is quoted as saying the ads "were so blatantly against television and that is our entire core business. You know we can't be selling our airtime and then telling people to turn their TVs off."&lt;ref name="Friesen"/&gt;

===Antisemitism===
&lt;!--Editors wishing to make substantive edits to this section are advised to peruse the relevant discussions that have taken place at the article's Discussion page.--&gt;
In March 2004, ''Adbusters'' was accused of [[antisemitism]] after running an article titled "Why won't anyone say they are Jewish?" The article compiled a list of [[neoconservative]] supporters within the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] and marked the names of those it perceived as Jewish with a black dot. It questioned why, given Israel's role, the political implications of this Jewish neoconservative influence on [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] in the Middle East were not a subject of debate.&lt;ref name="AdbustersJewish"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adbusters.org/magazine/52/articles/jewish.html |title=Why won't anyone say they are Jewish? |author = [[Kalle Lasn|Lasn, Kalle]] | date = March–April 2004 |publisher=Adbusters |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040223012106/http://www.adbusters.org/magazine/52/articles/jewish.html |archivedate= 23 February 2004 |deadurl=yes |quote=Here at Adbusters, we decided to tackle the issue head on and came up with a carefully researched list of who appear to be the 50 most influential neocons in the US (see above). Deciding who exactly is a neocon is difficult since some neocons reject the term while others embrace it. Some shape policy from within the White House, while others are more peripheral, exacting influence indirectly as journalists, academics and think tank policy wonks. What they all share is the view that the US is a benevolent hyper power that must protect itself by reshaping the rest of the world into its morally superior image. And half of them are Jewish.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Adbusters, Max Cleland, and more |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/794ebwmq.asp |work=The Weekly Standard |date=8 March 2004 |accessdate=20 November 2007 |postscript= |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071226054703/http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/794ebwmq.asp |archivedate=26 December 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ineffective activism===
Some critics claim that culture jamming does little to incite real difference.&lt;ref name="1 April 2009" /&gt;  Others declare the movement an easy way for upper- and middle-class citizens to feel empowered by engaging in activism that bears no personal cost, such as the campaign "[[Buy Nothing Day]]".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These critics feel a need for "resistance against the causes of capitalist exploitation, not its symptoms".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

'''Adolphus Busch''' (10 July 1839 – 10 October 1913) was the [[Germany|German]]-born co-founder of [[Anheuser-Busch]] with his father-in-law, [[Eberhard Anheuser]]. He introduced numerous innovations, building the success of the company in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He became a philanthropist, using his great wealth for education and humanitarian needs. His great-great-grandson, [[August Busch IV]] is now on the board of [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]].

==Early life==
Busch was born on July 10, 1839, to Ulrich Busch and Barbara Pfeiffer&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; in [[Mainz-Kastel|Kastel]], then a district of [[Mainz]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]. He was the twenty-first of twenty-two children.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Movers and Shakers, Scalawags and Suffragettes: Tales from Bellefontaine Cemetery|last=Shepley|first=Carol Ferring|publisher=Missouri History Museum|year=2008|isbn=|location=St. Louis, MO|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wealthy family ran a wholesale business of winery and brewery supplies. Busch and his brothers all received quality educations, and he graduated from the Collegiate Institute of Belgium in Brussels.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;

In 1857, at the age of 18, Busch emigrated with three of his older brothers to [[St. Louis, Missouri]]&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; which was a major destination for German immigrants in the nineteenth century. Because he had so many siblings, Adolphus did not expect to inherit much of his father's estate and had to make his own way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since St. Louis was home to so many German immigrants, the market for beer was large. The city also had two natural resources essential for manufacturing and storing beer in that time, before refrigeration: the river provided an ample water supply; and the city had many caves that would keep beer cool.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

His brother Johann established a brewery in [[Washington, Missouri]]. Ulrich Jr. married a daughter of [[Eberhard Anheuser]] in St. Louis, and settled in [[Chicago]]. Anton was a [[hops]] dealer who later returned to Mainz.

==Career==
Busch's first job in St. Louis was working as a clerk in the commission house. He was also an employee at William Hainrichshofen's wholesale company. During the [[American Civil War]] Busch served in the [[Union Army]] for six months. During this period, he learned that his father had died and he had inherited a portion of the estate.

Busch partnered with Ernst Battenberg in St. Louis to found the first of his businesses, a brewing supply company that sold to the three dozen breweries in the city. Eberhard Anheuser was one of Adolphus' customers. Anheuser was a soap manufacturer that lent money to the Bavarian Brewery. When the small brewery went bankrupt, Anheuser bought out the other creditors and renamed the company Anheuser. Adolphus married Eberhard's daughter Lilly in 1861.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Returning to St. Louis after the Civil War, Busch entered his wife's family's brewery business. He bought out Eberhard's partner, William D'Oench. In 1879, the company was renamed Anheuser-Busch.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At the death of Eberhard Anheuser in 1880, Busch became president of the business, and became wealthy due to the success of the brewery. He envisioned a national beer with universal appeal. His work was distinguished by his "timely adoption of important scientific and technological innovations, an expansive sales strategy geared largely toward external domestic and international population centers, and a pioneering integrated marketing plan that focused on a single core brand, Budweiser, making it the most successful nationally-distributed beer of the pre-Prohibition era."&lt;ref name="holian" /&gt;
[[File:Adolphus01.jpg|thumb|right|The Adolphus Hotel in Dallas, Texas.]]
To build Budweiser as a national beer, Busch created a network of rail-side ice-houses and launched the industry's first fleet of refrigerated freight cars.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; However, throughout his life, he jokingly referred to his beer as "dot schlop" and preferred wine to drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McClelland |first=Edward |title=The rise and fall of an American beer |url=http://www.salon.com/life/food/eat_drink/2008/07/17/budweiser |work=Salon.com |date=17 July 2008|accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Busch implemented pasteurization (1878) as a way to keep the beer fresh for longer, his company was able to profit from shipping beer across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Geography of Beer: Regions, Environment, and Societies | author1=Patterson, Mark W.|author2=Pullen, Nancy Hoalst | publisher=Springer | year=2014 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zY7FBAAAQBAJ| page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Busch soon acquired breweries in Texas which allowed his operation to distribute to Mexico and California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The City in Texas: A History | author=McComb, David G. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6vxtBgAAQBAJ | publisher=University of Texas Press | year=2015| page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Alcohol and Temperance in Modern History: An International Encyclopedia | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BuzNzm-x0l8C | author1=Blocker, Jack S.|author2=Fahey, David M.|author3=Tyrrell, Ian R. | publisher=ABC-CLIO | year=2003 | page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Busch was an early adopter of bottled beer and founded the Busch Glass Company to make bottles for his product.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; In 1901 sales surpassed the one million barrels of beer benchmark.

In addition to pasteurization and refrigeration, Busch was an early adopter of vertical integration, or buying all components of a business.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} He bought bottling factories, ice-manufacturing plants, stave makers, timberland, coal mines, and a refrigeration company. He also bought railways and bought the rights from Rudolf Diesel to assemble diesel engines in America.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Busch family also acquired hop farms in the area near [[Cooperstown, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://countryfolks.com/its-back-to-the-future-for-hager-hops-farm-family/ Country Folks Magazine: It is back to the future for Hager Hops farm family, Louis Busch Hager]&lt;/ref&gt;

His focus on the business extended to the flavor of the beer itself. Carl Conrad held the trademark for the name [[Budweiser]] and had Anheuser-Busch manufacture it for him. Conrad was an importer of wines and champagnes. Busch studied the pilsner process in Europe, which was used for brewing Budweiser. Adolphus bought the rights to Budweiser from Conrad in October 1882 when Conrad went bankrupt.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Busch served as the president of the South Side Bank and the [[Manufacturers Railway (St. Louis)|Manufacturers Railway]].&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buschtotunnel"&gt;{{cite news|title=Busch to Tunnel Under the River. Manufacturers' Railway Plans $3,000,000 Route Through the Mississippi for New Terminal System. New Gulf Road for City.

He also was a director of the Louisiana Purchase Company.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; Like other business leaders, he served as a director of the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, contributing to civic efforts.&lt;ref name="holian"/&gt;

Busch invested in new buildings and businesses in [[Dallas, Texas]], which was growing rapidly in the early 20th century as an industrial city. In 1912, Busch constructed the [[Adolphus Hotel]] there as the tallest building in the state. Another was the Busch Building, which has been adapted as the [[Kirby Building|Kirby Residences]], and is located at 1509 Main St. It is a [[National Historic Landmark]].

==Philanthropy==
From his early years, Busch contributed generously to charitable and education needs. With a lifelong interest in his homeland, he assisted in repairing devastation from the 1882 flooding of Mainz-Kastel by the Rhine River. He donated $100,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.1|1906|r=1}} million today) to [[San Francisco]] after the 1906 earthquake - $50,000 personally and $50,000 from his company.&lt;ref name="holian"&gt;[http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=152 Holian, Timothy J. "Adolphus Busch"], In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present,'' vol. 3, edited by Giles R. Hoyt. German Historical Institute. Last modified August 09, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Busch contributed a total of $350,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.35|1906|r=1}} million today) to Harvard to endow a Germanic museum, named [[Adolphus Busch Hall]].&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Busch married Elise "Lilly" Eberhard Anheuser,  the third daughter of [[Eberhard Anheuser]], on 7 March 1861 in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; They had thirteen children; eight sons, including [[Adolphus Busch II]], [[August Anheuser Busch I]] and Carl Busch, and five daughters. The Busches often traveled to Germany where they built their mansion. They named it the Villa Lilly for Mrs Busch. It is located in [[Lindschied]] near [[Bad Schwalbach|Langenschwalbach]], in present-day [[Bad Schwalbach]].&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[Image:Busch Mausoleum 2013.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Busch Mausoleum at [[Bellefontaine Cemetery]], designed by [[Barnett, Haynes &amp; Barnett]].]]
Busch died in [[Lindschied]] in 1913 while on vacation. He had been suffering from [[dropsy]] since 1906.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/10/11/100651720.pdf |format=pdf |title=Adolphus Busch Dies in Prussia |work= New York Times |date= October 11, 1913 |accessdate=2013-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his widow, five daughters and two sons, [[August Anheuser Busch Sr.|August A.]] and Carl Busch, both of St. Louis.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; His body was brought back to the United States in 1915 by ship, and transported by train to St. Louis.

Almost thirty thousand people paid their respects to Adolphus Busch when his body lay in state in the family mansion in St. Louis. Notable guests included the U.S. secretary of agriculture, the president of Harvard University, and the president of the University of California. Twenty-five trucks were needed to transport all the flower arrangements to the cemetery and a 250 piece band led the funeral procession. The procession spanned twenty miles, from No. 1 Busch Place to [[Bellefontaine Cemetery]], Adolphus' final resting place. As many as 100,000 mourners lined the streets for the procession. Five minutes of silence were observed at the request of Mayor Henry W. Kiel and the lights were turned off at the Jefferson and Planter's House hotels. Streetcars were also halted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lilly Anheuser's parents had built a mausoleum at Bellefontaine Cemetery, but she felt that Adolphus needed something grander. She tore down the original structure, and had the other family members reinterred outside. She had Thomas Barnett design a new mausoleum in the Bavarian Gothic style. Constructed of stone quarried in Missouri, and completed in 1921,  the new building cost $250,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.1|1906|r=1}} million today). It features grapevines representing both Adolphus' birthplace in German wine country, and his favorite beverage. Julius Caesar's words, "Veni, Vidi, Vici," or "I came, I saw, I conquered" are inscribed on the lintel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lilly died of a [[heart attack]] and [[pneumonia]] on February 17, 1928 in Pasadena, California. Her body was brought back to St. Louis, and was buried beside her husband.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''agricultural machinery industry''' or '''agricultural engineering industry''' is the part of the [[industry]], that produces and maintain [[tractor]]s, [[agricultural machinery]] and agricultural implements. This branch is considered to be part of the [[machinery industry]].

== History ==
:''See also history of [[Agricultural machinery#History|Agricultural machinery]] and [[Mechanised agriculture#History|Mechanised agriculture]]''

=== 19th century ===
The agricultural machinery industry emerged in Britain and the United States in the 19th century. Until then the common tools of farming were the [[plough]] and the sickle.&lt;ref name="RCG 1992"&gt;R.C. Gifford. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=G6JkSfrmbF8C&amp;pg=PA7 Agricultural Engineering in Development: Concepts and principles].'' 1992. p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; These iron agricultural implements were often made by [[blacksmiths]] in the local village, who regularly also acted as [[farrier]]. In the first part of the 19th century some of the early agricultural machine manufacturers arose from these blacksmith workshops,&lt;ref name="JHM94"&gt;Jan H. Maas (1994) ''De Nederlandse agrosector: geografie en dynamiek'' p.177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1992, p. 9) even stated that "nearly all farm machinery manufacturers today can be trace their beginnings to a blacksmith."&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[John Deere]] who started up with the production of ploughs in series in the 1840s. 
[[File:Great Exhibition, Agricutlural Implements 2, HF Talbot, 1851.jpg|thumb|Agricultural Implements, 1851.]]
Other companies arose from the introduction of horse drawn [[reaper|reaping]], which replaced the type of [[Scythe|hand reaper]] in use since biblical times.&lt;ref name="RCG 1992"/&gt; A company as the [[International Harvester|McCormick]] started up with building these kind of harvesting machines around the 1840s. And another origin of agricultural industry was the introduction of combined harvesting, threshing and cleaning in the 1830s.&lt;ref name="RCG 1992"/&gt; The [[Case Corporation]] for example started building those in 1842 as the Racine Threshing Machine Works. Until early 20th century most of those machinery were powered by horses.&lt;ref name="RCG 1992"/&gt;

Mid 19th century the portable steam-powered [[ploughing engine|plowing engine]]s were introduced. They were used in pairs, placed on either side of a field to haul a plow back and forth between them using a wire cable. These [[portable engine]]s were also used to power threshing machines, mills and pumps.&lt;ref name="RCG 1992"/&gt; The portable steam engines were produced by specific agricultural machinery maker, such as [[Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies]] who had started as brass and iron-founder making casting ploughshares late 18th century.

Late 19th century in Britain more companies such as [[Richard Garrett &amp; Sons]] and [[Mann’s Patent Steam Cart and Wagon Company]] developed [[steam tractor]]s for direct ploughing, but the heavy, wet soil of England meant that these designs were less economical than a team of horses. In the United States, where soil conditions permitted, steam tractors were used to direct-haul plows. Steam-powered agricultural engines remained in use well into the 20th century until reliable internal combustion engines had been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe30s/machines_04.html|title=Tractors in the 1930s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins (1987) recalled that the impact of the agricultural machinery industry in the 19th century was still limited. He stated : "prior the third quarter of the nineteenth century the impact of machinery in agriculture was slight compared with that in manufacturing industry. Some operations such as barn work and hay and corn harvesting had been largely mechanized by 1880 but, up to the Second World War, many were still performed by hand labour and large numbers of workers were still required for seasonal tasks such as hop- and fruit-picking and vegetable cultivations."&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Edward JT. "[http://www.bahs.org.uk/AGHR/ARTICLES/35n1a4.pdf The rationality of'surplus' agricultural labour: mechanization in English agriculture in the nineteenth century]." The Agricultural History Review (1987): 36-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===
In the beginning of the 20th century in the UK the Agricultural machinery industry "although composed of many hundreds of firms, was dominated by a few large ones, chiefly in the eastern counties of England. The total output of the industry was estimated to be worth 6.5 million pounds in 1913, or about 5 percent of the total value of the output of the mechanical engineering industry at the first Census of Production in 1907."&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, Peter. "The British Agricultural Machinery Industry, 1914-1939: Boom, Crisis, and Response." ''Agricultural History'' (1995): 298-313.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006016 027 IFA-Traktor mit Anbauwechselpflug.jpg|thumb|Agricultural exhibitions, 1951]]
In the first decennia the [[internal combustion engine]]; first the [[petrol engine]], and later [[diesel engine]]s; became the main source of [[power (physics)|power]] for the next generation of tractors. Early companies expanded into the tractor business, such as [[John Deere]] which bought the [[Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company]] in 1918, which manufactured the popular [[Waterloo Boy]] tractor. In the 1930s new technologies as rubber ties and hydrologics were introduced in tractors and other farm machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1992, p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; The diesel engines also contributed to the development of the self-propelled, combined harvester and thresher, or [[combine harvester]] (also shortened to 'combine'). Instead of cutting the grain stalks and transporting them to a stationary threshing machine, these combines cut, threshed, and separated the grain while moving continuously through the field.

In the second part of the 20th century the production of agricultural machinery in development countries rose rapidly. In the 1960s a country as the UK exported more than 60% of its production to Western Europe, Australia, USA, Canada and South Africa, and main manufacturers started production plants abroad. Another trend was the increased concentration among manufacturers. In the 1970s in the UK six companies supplied 75% of the total output.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Cowling, David Metcalf, A. J. Rayner. (1973) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cKjYBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128 Resource Structure of Agriculture: An Economic Analysis],'' p. 127-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: World bank (1954) ''[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1954/06/1554374/western-europe-tractor-agricultural-machinery-industry Western Europe - Tractor and agricultural machinery industry].''&lt;/ref&gt;

The further mechanization of agriculture in the 20th century made possible by the agricultural machinery industry had a huge impact of the economic structure of society. In the developed countries the total labour force engaged in agriculture dropped from about 75% in 1800 to less than 5% late 20th century.&lt;ref name="G 92 p.9"&gt;Gifford (1992, p. 9)&lt;/ref&gt; In developing countries, in late 20th century still 75% of all land "was farmed with only hand-tools and draught-animal technology."&lt;ref&gt;Gifford (1992, p. 10)&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey still 48% and in India 66.5% of the labor were working in agriculture, according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] Production Yearbook 1990.&lt;ref name="G 92 p.9"/&gt;

=== 21st century ===
A 2013 report by the [[VDMA]] gave the following preview of the current developments in the agricultural machinery industry:
:"''The general trends in society, agriculture and technology allow conclusions about the future requirements profile for agricultural machinery... The depicted dominating topics for the agricultural sector are
:* ''Precision &amp; automation''
:* ''Efficiency &amp; user friendliness''
:* ''Communication &amp; networking''
:''These topics are today already central components of the specifications for new developments...''"&lt;ref&gt;[[VDMA]].  ''[http://www.vdma.org/documents/105903/842491/VDMA%20Market%20Perspectives%202014.pdf/9a9a7bef-4bb5-4d11-891e-934998177005 Agricultural Machinery November 2013 : Market Perspectives 2014]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},'' 2013-14. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agricultural machinery ==
{{Main|Agricultural machinery|List of agricultural machinery}}
The agricultural machinery industry produces [[agricultural machinery]], machinery used in the operation of agricultural areas and farms. Main types are:&lt;ref name="AA 2012"&gt;Ade Asefeso (2012). ''CEO Guide to Doing Business in Australia,'' p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tractor]]s and power.
* Machinery for  [[tillage]] or soil cultivation.
* Machinery for [[planting]], [[sowing|seeding]], [[fertilizing]], [[pest control]], [[irrigation]].
* Machinery for [[harvesting]], [[haymaking]], and post-harvest, such as produce sorters, and machinery for loading
* Machinery for milking
* Other agricultural machinery, for example grinder mixers, wool presses and [[windmill]]s.&lt;ref name="AA 2012"/&gt;
In developed countries overall the largest segment of agricultural equipment sales is tractors.&lt;ref name="AA 2012"/&gt;

== Agricultural machinery manufacturers ==
Agricultural machinery manufacturers exist in sizes from small and medium business to multinationals. James &amp; Akrasanee (1988) stipulated that those forms have different production management, and can be classified into three groups:
:* ''The first group consists of those workshops with limited and simple equipment. Despite their flexibility, the production management system is very rare in this case.''
:* ''The second group includes those with certain degrees of division of labour within the plant. They do organize some plant layout, but not in a fully systematic manner.''
:* ''The last group constitutes those with clear production lines and division of labour.''&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth James, Narongchai Akrasanee. ''Small and Medium Business Improvement in the ASEAN Region: Production Management.'' Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 1 dec. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The two largest agricultural machinery manufacturers worldwide based on revenue (in 2012):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/257347/leading-machinery-manufacturers-worldwide/ The leading machinery manufacturers worldwide in 2012, based on revenue]. Accessed 25.11.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ANSEMAT Association of agricultural machinery manufacturers in Spain. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansemat.org/ ANSEMAT website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global agricultural machinery industry ==
According to the [[CEMA (European agricultural machinery)|CEMA]], the European association representing the European agricultural machinery industry, Europe was the largest producer of agricultural machinery globally in 2013:&lt;ref name="CEMA 2014"&gt;[[CEMA (European agricultural machinery)|CEMA]]. ''[http://cema-agri.org/publication/2013-another-strong-year-european-agricultural-machinery-industry 2013 another strong year for the European agricultural machinery industry].'' February 2014. Accessed 26.11.2014&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Europe produced 31% of the global production
* North America produced 26.5% of the global production, 
* China produced 26.5% of the global production, and
* The remaining 16% is produced elsewhere. 
In total, the production of agricultural machinery worldwide in 2013 generated about 95 billion euros,&lt;ref name="CEMA 2014"/&gt; based on a report ''Agricultural Machinery November 2013 : Market Perspectives 2014''&lt;ref&gt;VDMA. ''[http://www.vdma.org/documents/105903/842491/VDMA%20Market%20Perspectives%202014.pdf/9a9a7bef-4bb5-4d11-891e-934998177005 Agricultural Machinery November 2013 : Market Perspectives 2014]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},'' 2013-14. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[VDMA]], a German engineering association. Another recent statistic mentioned, that the agricultural machinery industry in 2010 generated worldwide about $56 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reportlinker.com/ci02002/Agricultural-Machinery.html Agricultural Machinery Industry Market Research &amp; Statistics]. Accessed 25.11.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agricultural machinery industry in Asia ===
Yuan'en (2007) stated, that the "Chinese government has attached great importance to agriculture, rural areas and farmers, made a series of policies that favorite to the farmers, added the financial subsidy to the agriculture, especially constituted the subsidy policies for the farmers on their agricultural machinery purchasing."&lt;ref&gt;Yuan’en, Gao, and Machinery Manufacturers. "Agricultural Machinery Industry in China." ''Chinese Association of Manufacturers of Agricultural Machinery'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013-2014 report acknowledged that "China's agricultural machinery industry has achieved rapid development, the gross output value of agricultural machinery exceeded RMB 300 billion, total power of agricultural machinery surpassed 1 billion kilowatts, and the integrated mechanization level of agricultural crops exceeded 50%, demonstrating that China has entered into a mechanized production-oriented period.... Tractors and harvesting machinery are the most important agricultural machinery products in China, with annual output of 2.25 million units and 1.114 million units in 2012 separately...'' &lt;ref&gt;Global and Chinese Agricultural Machinery Industry Report, 2013-2014,'' December 2013. Summary ( [http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/sqdz96/global_and online). Accessed 25.11.2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gyanendra (2006) recalled, that "the early agricultural mechanization in [[India]] was greatly influenced by the technological development in England. Irrigation pumps, tillage equipment, chaff cutters, tractors and threshers were gradually introduced for farm mechanization. The high yielding varieties with assured irrigation and higher rate of application of fertilizers gave higher returns that enabled farmers to adopt mechanization inputs, especially after Green revolution in 1960s."&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Gyanendra. "[http://agricoop.nic.in/Farm%20Mech.%20PDF/05024-09.pdf Agricultural Machinery Industry in India (Manufacturing, marketing and mechanization promotion)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318191654/http://agricoop.nic.in/Farm%20Mech.%20PDF/05024-09.pdf |date=March 18, 2013 }}."

The Turkish Ministry of Economy (2011) explained that "Turkey is one of the few countries of the world which is self-sufficient in food. At present Turkey is the largest producer and exporter of agricultural products in the Near East and North Africa... The agricultural machinery industry is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} about 1000 manufacturers countrywide.... Companies manufacturing agricultural machinery and equipment except tractors are mostly small and medium size companies. The sector employs about 15,000 workers...

=== Agricultural machinery industry in Europe ===
With a volume of 28 billion euros (2014) agricultural machinery production in the European Union (EU) represented 28 per cent of world total according to VDMA. Out of the EU total, the share of Germany is 27 per cent, followed by Italy (17 per cent) and France (14 per cent). All leading international manufacturers have several production sites on the European continent, and their products from these factories in general are destined for the high end customers who yield for efficiency and accuracy on the fields. 

The EU production of tractors was 187,000 units, correspondent to a value of 9.4 billion euros (2014). Outside the EU, a major production site for tractors is the Minsk Tractor Works (Belarus) with a high market share in the neighbouring countries, especially within the Commonwealth of Independent States. The leading countries for tractor production in the EU are Germany and Italy (with John Deere, Case New Holland, AGCO and Same Deutz-Fahr being the major brands). Germany is also the major place for the manufacturing of harvesting, spraying, fertilizing and seeding equipment. Italy and France have a primary position for soil working machines and transportation vehicles. The majority of the agricultural machinery companies are small and medium-sized and family owned. 

One third of the EU production is destined to markets outside the union, mainly to the Eastern European markets, but also to North America and, increasingly, to Asia.  

After a peak in 2003 and 29 billion euros of turnover, the sector experienced an economic downturn in 2014/2015. The strategy of the European industry is to keep its leading technological position and to diversify its market presence into the high potential regions (e.g. Asia).                 

=== Agricultural machinery industry in North America ===
The AEM (2014) stated that "U.S. domestic sales of agricultural machinery and equipment rose from about $20 billion in 1999 to $38 billion in 2012. Since 1998 and through 2012, U.S. exports of agricultural equipment have grown relatively quickly, more than doubling from about $4 billion to $8.7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;AEM (2014) ''[http://www.aem.org/MarketInfo/MarketIntel/WhitePapers/EconomicFootprint-AgriculturalEquipmentIndustry/Files/AEM_Economic_Whitepaper.pdf The Economic Footprint of the Agricultural Equipment Industry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205044016/http://www.aem.org/MarketInfo/MarketIntel/WhitePapers/EconomicFootprint-AgriculturalEquipmentIndustry/Files/AEM_Economic_Whitepaper.pdf |date=December 5, 2014 }}.'' Whitepaper.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agricultural machinery industry in South America ===
Graciela summarized (2008) that "the agricultural machinery industry in [[Argentina]] depends for growth on higher exports and further progress towards internationalization, which are strategic goals for the largest firms. Given the dynamism of global demand for this type of machinery, the conclusion is that the sector can increase its sales in export markets, where some of its products are competing well."&lt;ref&gt;García, Graciela.

'''Anthony Joseph Drexel Sr.''' (September 13, 1826 – June 30, 1893) was an American banker who played a major role in the rise of modern global finance after the [[American Civil War]]. As the dominant partner of [[Drexel &amp; Co.]] of [[Philadelphia]], he founded [[Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co.|Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co]] (later [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]]) in New York in 1871 with [[J. P. Morgan]] as his junior partner. He also founded [[Drexel University]] in 1891.{{sfnp|Rottenberg|2001}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anthony-Joseph-Drexel|title=Anthony Joseph Drexel {{!}} American banker|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the first president of the Fairmount Park Art Association (now the [[Association for Public Art]]), the nation's first private organization dedicated to integrating public art and urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Theo B.|title=Fairmount: Philadelphia's Park|publisher=The Art Alliance Press| location = Philadelphia, PA | year = 1975| isbn = 0879820152 | page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:AJDrexelStatue.jpg|thumb|right|Anthony J. Drexel's statue at [[Drexel University]]]]Drexel was born in 1826 in [[Philadelphia]] to [[Francis Martin Drexel]] (1792–1863) and Catherine Hookey (1795–1870). He was the brother of [[Francis Anthony Drexel]], and [[Joseph William Drexel]]. He was the uncle of Saint [[Katharine Drexel]].

==Career==
{{Main|Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co.|Drexel, Harjes &amp; Co.}}

At the age of 13 he began to work in the banking house founded three years earlier by his father, the Austrian-born American banker [[Francis Martin Drexel]].&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;{{cite book|last=McDonald|first=Edward D.|author2=Edward M. Hinton|title=Drexel Institute of Technology 1891–1941|publisher=Haddon Craftsmen, Inc.|year=1942|isbn=1-4067-6374-8|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847 he was named a member of the firm [[Drexel &amp; Company]], the original predecessor of what would become [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]].&lt;ref name="McDonald" /&gt;

After the death of his father in 1863, Drexel closed the bank's Chicago and San Francisco offices and changed the name of its New York branch from Read, Drexel &amp; Co. to Drexel Winthrop. In 1867 he founded a separate Paris-based banking partnership, [[Drexel, Harjes &amp; Co.]], with John H. Harjes and Eugene Winthrop.&lt;ref name="McDonald"/&gt;

Three years later, in 1871, at the urging of [[Junius Spencer Morgan]] in London, Drexel became the mentor of Junius's troubled son, [[J. P. Morgan|John Pierpont Morgan]] of New York, and entered into a new partnership with young Morgan, forming [[Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co.|Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co]].{{sfnp|Rottenberg|2001}} This new merchant banking partnership, which was based in New York, rather than Philadelphia, served initially as an agent for Europeans investing in the United States. Over the next generation, this partnership assumed the leading role in financing America's railroads and stabilizing and revitalizing Wall Street's chaotic securities markets. The firm created a national capital market for industrial companies— a market that had previously existed only for railroads and canals. To restore investor confidence, Drexel Morgan underwrote the pay of the entire U.S. Army when Congress refused to do so in 1877, bailed out the U.S.Government during the Panic of 1895 and rescued the New York Stock Exchange during the Panic of 1907.{{sfnp|Rottenberg|2001}} With the formation of Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co., Drexel Harjes became the French affiliate of an international banking firm with offices in [[London]], [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City]] and Paris that would subsequently become [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]]

Two years after Drexel's death in 1893, Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. was renamed [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]]., one of the original predecessors of what is today [[JPMorgan Chase]]. In 1901, the bank financed the formation of the [[United States Steel Corporation]], the world's first billion-dollar corporation, which took over the business of [[Andrew Carnegie]] and other companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5047">The '''Becher Process''' is an [[industrial process]] used to upgrade [[ilmenite]] to [[synthetic rutile]].

The [[mineral]], ilmenite, contains 55-65% [[titanium]] as [[Titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], the rest being [[iron oxide]]. The Becher process removes the iron oxide, leaving a residue of [[synthetic rutile]], which is more than 90% TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemlink.com.au/titan_rutile.htm| title=Rutile and ilmenite - Australian production and potential profile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
This technology was developed in the early 1960s in [[Western Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianminesatlas.gov.au/info/factsheets/titanium.jsp |title=Australian Atlas of Mineral Resources Mineral Sands Fact Sheet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830005748/http://www.australianminesatlas.gov.au/info/factsheets/titanium.jsp |archivedate=2007-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by a joint initiative between industry and government. The process was named after [[Robert Gordon Becher]], who while working at the Western Australian Government Chemical Laboratories invented, developed and introduced the technique to the Western Australian Mineral Sands industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cluniesross.org.au/the-awards/previous-award-winners/1992-award-winners/ |title=ATSE Clunies Ross Foundation Medal Awards - 1992 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was patented in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com.au/patents/WO1996024699A1?cl=en|title=Treatment of titanium-containing material |publisher=CLAIMS Patent Services|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==

The Becher Process is suitable for [[weathered]] ilmenite that has low [[concentration]]s of [[chromium]] and [[magnesium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwscience.murdoch.edu.au/teach/m358/titanium.pdf |title=Murdoch University Titanium |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201183427/http://wwwscience.murdoch.edu.au/teach/m358/titanium.pdf |archivedate=2006-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four steps involved in removing the iron portion of the ilmentite:
# [[Oxidation]]
# [[Redox]]
# [[Aeration]]
# [[Leaching (chemical science)|Leaching]]

===Oxidation===
Oxidation involves heating the ilmenite in a rotary kiln with air to convert all of the iron in the ilmenite grains to [[iron(III) oxide]]:

: 4 FeTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;middot;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt;

This allows for use of a wide range of ilmenite materials with varying Fe(II) and Fe(III) content to be used in the next step.

===Reduction===
Reduction is performed in a rotary kiln with pseudobrookite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), coal and sulfur, then heated to a temperature greater than 1200&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.cmewa.com.au/images/1_MineralSands.pdf |title=Chamber of Minerals and Energy Western Australia - Mineral Sands Factsheet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704132348/http://www.education.cmewa.com.au/images/1_MineralSands.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The iron oxide in the mineral grains is reduced to metallic iron to produce reduced ilmenite:

: Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;middot;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 CO &lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Fe &lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; +  TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt;

Once the Reduced Ilmenite has cooled it is separated from the char by screening, then continues to the next step of the process.

===Aeration===
Aeration involves the removal of the metallic iron created in the last step by "rusting" it out. This is achieved in large tanks that contain 1% [[ammonium chloride]] solution with air being pumped through the tank. The tank is being continuously agitated, and the iron will rust and precipitate out of solution, away from the titanium dioxide portion in the form of a slime.

: 4 Fe &lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The finer iron oxide is then separated from the larger particles of synthetic rutile.

=== Acid Leach ===
Once the majority of the Iron Oxide has been removed the remainder of it is leached away using 0.5M [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?WO=1994%2F03647&amp;IA=WO1994%2F03647&amp;DISPLAY=DESC |title=WIPO-WO/1994/003647 TREATMENT OF TITANIFEROUS MATERIALS }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''BJÖRGÓLFSSON, BJÖGÓLFUR THOR (1967-- )'').&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]''’ [[Sunday Times Rich List]] put his net worth at £2,000&amp;nbsp;million. However, following the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]], Björgólfur's net worth had declined to $1&amp;nbsp;billion by March 2009. He worked out a complex deal with his creditors to pay off his debts while holding on to his key investments and on March 20, 2017 Forbes estimated his net worth at $1.81&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="Thor Björgólfsson profile on Forbes"/&gt; He published an autobiography in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust and Back'' (London: Profile Books, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and family life==
Björgólfur Thor is heir to a long family legacy in Icelandic business and politics. His great-grandfather was the legendary Danish-born Icelandic entrepreneur [[Thor Philip Axel Jensen|Thor Jensen]], who helped introduce industrial capitalism to the country in the early years of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dv.is/brennidepill/2008/10/28/leyndarmal-bjorgolfs/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201040352/http://www.dv.is/brennidepill/2008/10/28/leyndarmal-bjorgolfs/ |date=1 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eighth of Thor's eleven children was [[Margrét Þorbjörg Thors Hallgrímsson]], whose daughter [[Margrét Þóra Hallgrímsson|Þóra Hallgrímsson]] had Björgólfur Thor as her only child by her third husband [[Björgólfur Guðmundsson]]. Þóra Hallgrímsdóttir, Björgólfur Thor's mother, was married to [[George Lincoln Rockwell]], founder of the American Nazi party. Björgólfur Thor has often emphasised this, for example by adapting for his company [[Novator Partners|Novator]] the old logo of [[Eimskip]], which Thor had originally designed for his company Kveldúlfur hf,&lt;ref&gt;Guðmundur Magnússon, ''Thorsararnir: auður – völd – örlög'' (Reykjavík: Almenna bókafélagið, 2005), p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; and through his association with the biographical documentary ''Thor's Saga'' by Ulla Boje Rasmussen, which draws parallels between Thor Jensen and Björgólfur Thor.&lt;ref name="upfrontfilms1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Thorn - http://www.spildaftid.dk |url=http://www.upfrontfilms.dk/films2.php?mit_indhold_id=2&amp;films_id=13 |title=Upfront Films + 45 888 10 788 |publisher=Upfrontfilms.dk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bjorgolfsson, Thor and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014), esp. pp. 30-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Björgólfur Thor grew up in the Reykjavík suburb of [[Vesturbær]].&lt;ref&gt;Jón G. Hauksson, 'Björgólfur Thor og Jón Tetzchner: Íslendingar eiga tvo leiðtoga í 237 manna hópi „Ungra leiðtoga" sem taka þátt í verkefninu Forum of Young Global Leaders', ''Frjáls verslun'', 67.1 (2005), 16–22 (p. 18); {{ISSN|1017-3544}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A sketch of Björgólfur Thor's early life is offered by [[Ármann Þorvaldsson]]:

:His rare self-confidence made him stand out. He was immensely physically strong and bench pressed over 450 pounds. He was an entrepreneur from early on, and by the age of 11 he was delivering newspapers in the early hours of the morning. A year later he was a delivery boy at the University of Iceland and, at 13, was running his own home video delivery service. While still in high school, he was running a nightclub in Reykjavík and organised the first Oktoberfest beer festival in Iceland. After high school, he studied business in New York. Fluent in several languages, and with an unusual ability to both blend in and stand out, he embodied Iceland's internationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Armann Thorvaldsson, ''Frozen Assets: How I Lived Iceland's Boom and Bust'' (Chichester: Wiley, 2009), pp. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the firm of Björgólfur Thor's father [[Björgólfur Guðmundsson]], [[Hafskip]], became embroiled in a financial scandal and was bankrupted; the scandal may have arisen from the efforts of Hafskip's main competitor [[Eimskip]] and its allied political party, the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]], to reduce competition, and the events had a considerable effect on the young Björgólfur Thor.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Boyes, ''Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island'' (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 64-66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bjorgolfsson, Thor and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014), pp. 24-34.&lt;/ref&gt; At times he has presented his subsequent business activities as an effort to regain his and his father's reputations and pay their opponents back.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Kroll, Luisa, 'Thor's Saga', ''Forbes Global'', 8.5 (2005), 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating from the prestigious [[Commercial College of Iceland]] in 1987, he followed in the footsteps of some of his siblings and moved to the US, in a move he has portrayed as an attempt to escape an Iceland where he felt an outsider.&lt;ref&gt;Bjorgolfsson, Thor and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014), pp. 33-38.&lt;/ref&gt; He began higher education at the [[University of California, San Diego]], later transferring to the Leonard N Stern School of Business at [[New York University]],&lt;ref&gt;Bjorgolfsson, Thor and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014), pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; graduating with a B.S. in Marketing in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Guðmundur Hálfdanarson, ''Historical Dictionary of Iceland'', 2nd edn, Historical Dictionaries of Europe, 66 (Lanham, Maryland: The Scarecrow Press, 2008), p. 21 (s.v.

While studying, Björgólfur Thor took a variety of vacation jobs, including running events manager&lt;ref&gt;Bjorgolfsson, Thor and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014), pp. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt; at Reykjavík's then two biggest clubs: Tunglið and Skuggabarinn. In the course of this, in 1991, he met Kristín Ólafsdóttir, now a film-maker;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2208713/|title=Kristín Ólafsdóttir|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; they married in 2010.&lt;ref name="Bjorgolfsson 2014 p. 217"&gt;Bjorgolfsson, Thor and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014), p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; They have three children, Daniel (b. 2005), Lorenz (b. 2009), and Bentina (b. 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Where have all the billionaires gone? | publisher=IceNews: News from the Nordics | date=16 June 2009 | url=http://www.icenews.is/2009/06/16/where-have-all-the-billionaires-gone/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Yves | last=Smith | title=Ragnarok - Iceland and the "Doom of the Gods" | work=The Automatic Earth | date=16 December 2013 | url=http://www.theautomaticearth.com/ragnarok-iceland-doom-gods-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Roger | last=Boyes | title=Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island | location=New York | publisher=Bloomsbury | date=2009 | page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Louisa | last=Kroll | title=Thor's Saga | work=Forbes | date=28 March 2005 | url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2005/0328/138.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bjorgolfsson 2014 p. 217"/&gt; They currently live primarily in London, United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Bjorgolfsson, Thor and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust—And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way'' (London: Profile, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beverage businessman in Saint Petersburg==
In 1991, Björgólfur Thor went to [[Russia]] along with his father and a friend, [[Magnús Þorsteinsson]]. The Icelandic businessmen, together with Russian partners, founded the [[bottling company]] ''Baltic Bottling Plant'', which they sold to Pepsi. Next they founded a [[brewing company]], originally called ''ООО "Торговый дом "РОСА"'' it was registered in March 1995 and changed its name to ''Bravo'' OOO in February 1996. It further changed its name to ''Bravo International'' OOO in August 1996 and ''Bravo International'' JSC in December 1997.&lt;ref name="icelandrussialink"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsru.com/finance/21oct2008/iceland_print.html |title=Россия желает спасать Исландию из-за давних офшорных связей чиновников и бизнесменов |date=21 October 2008 |publisher=The New Times }}.

Björgólfur Thor was president of all of them.&lt;ref name="icelandrussialink"/&gt; ''Bravo Brewery'' became a success producing the premium beer Botchkarov. The company became the fastest-growing brewery in Russia. [[Heineken]] bought the brewery for $400M in 2002.&lt;ref name="icelandrussialink"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whoisbjorgolfsson"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.invgr.com/bjorgolfur_thor_bjorgolfsson.htm | title=Who is Thor Bjorgolfsson, Iceland's lone billionaire? | publisher=Invest in Greece | date=2006-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Saint Petersburg opened an honorary consulate in Iceland. Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson was appointed [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] and Magnús Þorsteinsson was appointed Honorary Vice-Consul.&lt;ref name="icelandrussialink"/&gt; The opening ceremony was held on March 10, 2000.&lt;ref name="icelandrussialink"/&gt;

Björgólfur Thor's ventures in Russia raised suspicion. An article in ''The Guardian'' wondered where Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson's money came from and noted that in the 1990s the men "were not only ploughing money into the country but doing it in the city regarded as the [[Russian mafia]] capital. That investment was being made in the drinks sector, seen by the mafia as the industry of choice."&lt;ref name="vikinginvasion"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/jun/16/marksspencer | title=Next-generation Viking invasion - They've got the cash to buy big UK groups like M&amp;S. But where does it come from? | publisher=The Guardian | date=16 June 2005 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Griffiths}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns were raised by ''Die Welt''.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Stocker, 'Holprige Fahrt vom Balkan nach Europa', ''Die Welt'', 08.01.06, https://www.welt.de/print-wams/article136961/Holprige-Fahrt-vom-Balkan-nach-Europa.html&lt;/ref&gt; Competitors in the Saint Petersburg brewing market faced problems. For instance, Ilya Weismann, deputy director of competing beverage company ''Baltic'', was assassinated on 10 January 2000. Later ''Baltic'' director general Aslanbek Chochiev was also assassinated. One competing Saint Petersburg brewery burned to the ground.&lt;ref name="icelandrussialink"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vikinginvasion"/&gt;

Björgólfur Thor has strongly denied any connection with mafia activity. In his book, ''Billions to Bust and Back'',&lt;ref&gt;Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson and Andrew Cave, ''Billions to Bust and Back'' (London: Profile Books, 2014), pp. 55-65.&lt;/ref&gt; he chronicles his time in St Petersburg, detailing how criminal elements tried to intimidate him into giving them access to his business and explaining which security measures he relied on to prevent it.

==New businesses==

Björgólfur Thor was the main owner as well as the chairman of the [[Straumur Investment Bank]].

==Financial crisis==
Two of Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson's companies, [[Landsbanki]] and [[Straumur]], left the Icelandic people with several billions of dollars in debt when they went bankrupt following the [[2008–11 Icelandic financial crisis]]. He has been heavily criticized for his actions leading to the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2008/10/31/interview-with-bjorgolfur-thor-bjorgolfsson/ |author=IceNews - Daily News |title=Interview with Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson |accessdate=2009-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230175627/http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2008/10/31/interview-with-bjorgolfur-thor-bjorgolfsson/ |archivedate=30 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after the publication of the Icelandic government report on the financial crisis on 12 April 2010, Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson issued a public apology for his role in the crisis in the Icelandic newspaper ''[[Fréttablaðið]]'', including the statement:

:I the undersigned, Björgólfur Thor, request forgiveness from all Icelanders for my role in the asset- and debt-bubble that led to the collapse of the Icelandic banking system. I request your forgiveness for my complacency towards the danger signs which arose. I request forgiveness for having not succeeded in following my instincts when I realised the danger. I request your forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson, ‘[http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=323631&amp;pageId=5074682&amp;lang=is&amp;q=%C9g%20bi%F0%20ykkur%20afs%F6kunar Ég bið ykkur afsökunar]’, Fréttablaðið 10.86 (14 April 2010), p. 19.

==Business after the crisis==
Although Björgólfur Thor's fortunes were reduced by the financial crisis, leading him to cancel the construction of a £100m luxury yacht, he has continued to prosper overall.&lt;ref name="autogenerated35"/&gt; He has defended his reputation by disputing government and journalistic criticisms of his role in the 2008 financial crisis on his website, through letters to newspapers, and through legal action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btb.is/ Bjorgolfur Thor Bjorgolfsson], letter, ''The Observer'' 11 December 2011, p. 46; Simon Bowers and Sigrún Daviðsdóttir, 'Icelandic tycoon still living the high life in London after the collapse of Icesave', ''The Observer'' (28 August 2011), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, the website "The Automatic Earth" reported:&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr Bjorgolfsson still leads Novator Partners, a London-based investment firm, sits on several boards and holds shares in companies including Actavis, a Swiss drugmaker, and CCP, an Icelandic computer games company.

In a companies' financial reporting, '''comprehensive Income''' (or '''comprehensive earnings''') "includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners".&lt;ref&gt;FASB Statement 130: Reporting Comprehensive Income (June 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Because that use excludes the effects of changing ownership interest, an economic measure of comprehensive income is necessary for financial analysis from the shareholders' point of view (All changes in Equity except those resulting from investment by or distribution to owners.)

==Accounting==
Comprehensive income is defined by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]], or FASB, as “the change in equity [net assets] of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.  It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.” 

Comprehensive income is the sum of [[net income]] and other items that must bypass the [[income statement]] because they have not been [[Realization (finance)|realized]], including items like an unrealized [[holding gains|holding gain]] or loss from [[available for sale]] [[security (finance)|securities]] and foreign [[currency]] translation gains or losses.  These items are not part of net income, yet are important enough to be included in comprehensive income, giving the user a bigger, more comprehensive picture of the organization as a whole.

Items included in comprehensive income, but not [[net income]] are reported under the [[accumulated other comprehensive income]] section of [[shareholder's equity]].

==Financial Analysis==
Comprehensive income attempts to measure the sum total of all operating and financial events that have changed the value of an owner's interest in a business.  It is measured on a per-share basis to capture the effects of dilution and options.  It cancels out the effects of equity transactions for which the owner would be indifferent: dividend payments, share buy-backs, and share issues at market value. 

It is calculated by reconciling the book value per-share from the start of the period to the end of the period.  This is conceptually the same as measuring a child's growth by finding the difference between his height on each birthday.  All other line items are calculated, and the equation solved for comprehensive earnings.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retailinvestor.org/earnings.html How to measure comprehensive income.]&lt;/ref&gt;

 '''Income Comprehensive definition:''' "income is increases{{clarify|date=June 2018}} in economic benefits in form of inflows or encashment of assets or decrease in liabilities that result is increase in capital(owners equity) is called income".

       Shareholders' Equity, beg. of period (per share)
     - Dividends paid (per share)
     + Shares issued (premium over book value per share)
     - Share buy-backs (premium over book value per share)
     + Comprehensive Income (per share)

{{Insolvency}}
A '''cram down''' or '''cramdown''' is the involuntary imposition by a court of a reorganization plan over the objection of some classes of creditors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/invest/glossary/bfglosc.htm#cramdown Definition at Bloomberg Financial Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home mortgage loans==

While typically used in a corporate context, the phrase has gained popularity in the context of personal bankruptcies as a result of the [[financial crisis of 2007-2009]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} 

Under current [[Federal government of the United States|United States]] law, bankruptcy courts are not allowed to perform cramdowns (i.e., reduce the principal amount or change the [[interest rate]] or other terms) on creditors who hold loans secured by [[mortgage loan|mortgage]]s on debtors' primary residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|11|1123|b|5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|11|1322|b|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

U.S. bankruptcy law provides for an automatic stay of any legal process against debtors or their assets (except perhaps legal process involving criminal law or family law) while bankruptcy is pending, but because U.S. bankruptcy courts cannot cram down loans secured by primary residences, creditors are able to file motions for relief from the stay.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4728933057984532667 Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank]'', 42 F.3d 26 (1st Cir. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  Once relief is granted, creditors may proceed with [[foreclosure]] ''immediately'' while debtors' other financial obligations await restructuring by the bankruptcy court.  Debtors may eventually obtain discharges of their other debts, but by then, they may already have lost their homes.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

===Historical context===

The prohibition on cramdowns on loans secured by primary residences was the result of a political compromise during the process of enacting the [[Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978]].  At the time, Congress was confronted with brutal [[stagflation]] in which economic stagnation was combined with sky-high inflation and interest rates, which were severely frustrating the United States' long-term federal public policy of promoting homeownership (which goes back to the [[National Housing Act of 1934]]).  Congress therefore decided to shield lenders on loans secured by primary residences from cramdowns because there was evidence that they perform "a valuable social service" through their loans.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2581289418078603137 In re Seidel]'', 752 F.2d 1382, 1386 (9th Cir. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;  

Generally, under [[risk-based pricing]], a rational lender will underwrite a loan with an interest rate that correlates directly to the borrower's [[credit risk]].  That is the risk that the lender cannot recover its entire expected [[return on investment]], which in turn includes not only the [[probability of default]], but also any external forces (like a bankruptcy court) that could delay repayment or force the lender to write off any part of the loan.  The higher the risk, the higher the interest rate.  Thus, Congress reasoned, if lenders knew their loans were protected from cramdowns, then they would offer loans at lower interest rates, which in turn would mean lower monthly payments, and thereby enable more Americans to afford homes.  In plain English, Congress sacrificed the interests of the minority of borrower-homeowners who default on their loans for the sake of lowering the cost of homeownership for the majority of borrower-homeowners who successfully repay their loans.  

This rule was fiercely litigated in the 1980s, but the prohibitions on cramdowns on primary residences in both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings were eventually upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;''Nobelman v. Am. Sav. Bank'', 508 U.S. 324, 326 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dewsnup v. Timm'', 502 U.S. 410, 418-419 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;  Finding no relief in Chapters 7 or 13, some individual borrowers tried the creative move of filing under Chapter 11 (which is normally used by corporations).  As a result, the home lending industry went back to Congress, which responded by extending the cramdown restriction for loans secured by primary residences to Chapter 11 with the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13473762298834860380 In re Weinstein]'', 227 B.R. 284, 290 n.4 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary issues===

As a potential solution to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], legislators and consumer advocates have advanced a proposal to allow cram downs on these loans, and legislation to that effect was introduced for potential inclusion in the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Siegel Bernard|first = Tara|title = A Bill Encouraging to Distressed Homeowners, but Its Reach Is Unclear|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|date = September 28, 2008|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/business/yourmoney/29consumer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the financial industry strongly voiced opposition to such a measure, claiming that it would create additional uncertainty as to the value of mortgage loans (and by extension, the [[collateralized debt obligation]]s into which they are bundled).  In addition, like in the late 1970s, the financial industry had powerful political leverage on its side: the risk that revoking the cramdown restriction would result in higher interest rates on home loans.  It was impossible to simultaneously enact a law preventing the industry from jacking up interest rates on all home loans; that would have raised the possibility of [[bank run]]s, because few investors would keep their money at an institution that is legally prohibited from setting interest rates on its loans to accurately reflect the underlying credit risk.  To prevent bank runs, Congress could have simultaneously imposed capital transfer restrictions, but that would have paralyzed the global economy.  As few politicians wanted to be blamed by Wall Street for making homes unaffordable or causing even more bank failures or a second Great Depression, the proposals for revoking the prevention of cramdowns on loans secured by primary residences never found much traction in Congress.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Early use of term==

The term "cram down" in the reorganization context appears in case law as early as 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/1944322143F2d179_1260/NEW%20ENGLAND%20COAL%20&amp;%20COKE%20CO.%20v.%20RUTLAND%20R.%20CO. New Eng. Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. Rutland R. Co.], 143 F.2d 179 (1944).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal use==

The term (sometimes used in the phrase '''cram-down deal''') has also gained currency to denote informally any transaction where existing investors ([[debt]] or [[Stock|equity]]) are forced by circumstance to accept an unappealing transaction, such as an expensive financing, a debt transaction that subordinates them, a dilutive equity raising, or an acquisition at an unappealingly low price.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/invest/glossary/bfglosc.htm#cram-down%20deal Definition at Bloomberg Financial Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Stracher|first = Cameron|title = The Year in Ideas: A to Z; The Cram-Down|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|date = December 9, 2001|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E4DF143CF93AA35751C1A9679C8B63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Customer Acquisition Cost''' is the cost associated in convincing a customer to buy a product/service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://five23.io/blog/knowing-your-customer-acquisition-cost/|title=Knowing Your Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)|last=Cook|first=Andrew|date=2017-06-29|work=Five23|access-date=2017-06-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cost is incurred by the organization to convince a potential customer. This is an important business metric. It plays a major role in calculating the value of the customer to the company and the resulting return on investment (ROI) of acquisition. The calculation of customer valuation helps a company decide how much of its resources can be profitably spent on a particular customer. In general terms, it helps to decide the worth of the customer to the company.

'''Customer Acquisition Cost''' (abbreviated to CAC) refers to the resources that a [[business]] must allocate (financial or otherwise) in order to acquire an additional [[customer]].

Numerically, ''customer acquisition cost'' is typically expressed as a [[ratio]] — dividing the sum total of ''CAC'' by the number of additional patrons acquired by the business as a result of the customer acquisition strategy.

==Relevance==

''Customer Acquisition Cost'' will typically increase as a business matures. It is also typical to see a diminishing return on ''CAC'' as a business grows in size and possibly geographical distribution. At some point, a given customer acquisition strategy will no longer be beneficial - this means that the financial [[rate of return]] that can be expected to accompany new customers is surpassed by the cost of acquiring those customers in the first place. Most businesses wisely choose to adopt a different strategy for customer acquisition before this point is reached.

Customer acquisition cost can be used in conjunction with [[SaaS]], [[Business-to-business|B2B]] [[software]] sales and [[Startup company|startups]]. The metric is mentioned in the publications of [[venture capital]] firms such as [[Accel Partners]], [[Bessemer Venture Partners]] or [[Matrix Partners]]. The CAC ratio also appears in business oriented magazines such as Forbes and Inc.com.

'''Drama theory''' is one of the [[problem structuring methods]] in [[operations research]]. It is based on [[game theory]] and adapts the use of games to complex organisational situations, accounting for emotional responses that can provoke irrational reactions and lead the players to redefine the game. In a drama, emotions trigger rationalizations that create changes in the game, and so change follows change until either all conflicts are resolved or action becomes necessary. The game as redefined is then played.

Drama theory was devised by Professor Nigel Howard in the early 90s and, since then, has been turned to defense, political, health, industrial relations and commercial applications. Drama theory is an extension of Howard's [[metagame analysis]] work developed at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in the late 1960s, and presented formally in his book "Paradoxes of Rationality", published by [[MIT Press]]. Metagame analysis was originally used to advise on the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (SALT).

== Basics of drama theory ==

A drama unfolds through ''episodes'' in which ''characters'' interact. The episode is a period of ''preplay communication'' between characters who, after communicating, act as players in a game that's constructed through the dialogue between them. The action that follows the episode is the playing out of this game; it sets up the next episode. Most drama-theoretic terminology is derived from a theatrical model applied to real life interactions; thus, an episode goes through phases of ''scene-setting'', ''build-up'', ''climax'' and ''decision''. This is followed by ''denouement'', which is the action that sets up the next episode. The term 'drama theory' and the use of theatrical terminology is justified by the fact that the theory applies to stage plays and fictional plots as well as to politics, war, business, personal and community relations, psychology, history and other kinds of human interaction. It was applied to help with the structuring of [[The Prisoner's Dilemma (play)|Prisoner's Dilemma]], a West End play by [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] about the problems of peace-keeping.
 
In the build-up phase of an episode, the characters exchange ideas and opinions in some form or another and try to advocate their preferred ''position'' – the game outcome that they are hoping to see realised. The position each character takes may be influenced by others' positions. Each character also presents a ''fallback'' or ''stated intention''. This is the action (i.e., individual strategy) a character says it will implement if current positions and stated intentions do not change. Taken together, the stated intentions form what is called a ''threatened future'' if they contradict some character's position; if they do not – i.e., if they implement every position – they form what is called an ''agreement''.

When it is [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] among the characters that positions and stated intentions are seen by their presenters as 'final', the build-up ends and the parties reach a ''moment of truth''. Here they usually face ''dilemmas'' arising from the fact that their threats or promises are incredible or inadequate. Different dilemmas are possible depending on whether or not there is an agreement. If there is an agreement (i.e., stated intentions implement every position), the possible dilemmas resemble those found in the [[prisoner's dilemma]] game; they arise from characters distrusting each other's declared intention to implement the agreement. If there is no agreement, more dilemmas are possible, resembling those in the [[game of chicken]]; they arise from the fact that a character's threat or its determination to stick to its position and reject other positions may be incredible to another character.

Drama theory asserts that a character faced with a dilemma feels specific positive or negative emotions that it tries to rationalize by persuading itself and others that the game should be redefined in a way that eliminates the dilemma; for example, a character with an incredible threat makes it credible by becoming angry and finding reasons why it should prefer to carry out the threat; likewise, a character with an incredible promise feels positive emotion toward the other as it looks for reasons why it should prefer to carry its promise. Emotional tension leads to the ''climax'', where characters re-define the moment of truth by finding rationalizations for changing positions, stated intentions, preferences, options or the set of characters. There is some experimental evidence to confirm this assertion of drama theory (see P. Murray-Jones, L. Stubbs and N. Howard, 'Confrontation and Collaboration Analysis: Experimental and Mathematical Results', presented at the [http://www.dodccrp.org/events/8th_ICCRTS/pdf/134.pdf 8th International Command &amp; Control Research and Technology Symposium, June, 2003]—from whose site it can be downloaded.

Six dilemmas (formerly called paradoxes) are defined, and it is proved that if none of them exist then the characters have an agreement that they fully trust each other to carry out. This is the fundamental theorem of drama theory. Until a ''resolution'' meeting these conditions is arrived at, the characters are under emotional pressure to rationalize re-definitions of the game that they will play. Re-definitions inspired by new dilemmas then follow each other until eventually, with or without a resolution, characters become players in the game they have defined for themselves. In game-theoretic terms, this is a 'game with a focal point' – i.e., it is a game in which each player has stated its intention to implement a certain strategy. This strategy is its threat (part of the threatened future) if an agreement has not been reached, and its promise (part of the agreement), if an agreement has been reached. At this point, players (since they are playing a game) decide whether to believe each other, and so to predict what others will do in order to decide what to do themselves.

== Dilemmas defined in drama theory ==

The dilemmas that character A may face with respect to another character B at a moment of truth are as follows.

# A's cooperation dilemma: B doesn't believe A would carry out its actual or putative promise to implement B's position.
# A's trust dilemma: A doesn't believe B would carry out its actual or putative promise to implement A's position.
# A's persuasion (also known as Deterrence) dilemma: B certainly prefers the threatened future to A's position.
# A's rejection (also known as Inducement) dilemma: A may prefer B's position to the threatened future.
# A's threat dilemma: B doesn't believe A would carry out its threat not to implement B's position.
# A's positioning dilemma: A prefers B's position to its own, but rejects it (usually because A considers B's position to be unrealistic).

== Relationship to game theory ==

Drama-theorists build and analyze models (called ''card tables'' or ''options boards'') that are isomorphic to game models, but unlike game theorists and most other model-builders, do not do so with the aim of finding a 'solution'. Instead, the aim is to find the dilemmas facing characters and so help to predict how they will re-define the model itself – i.e., the game that will be played. Such prediction requires not only analysis of the model and its dilemmas, but also exploration of the reality outside the model; without this it is impossible to decide which ways of changing the model in order to eliminate dilemmas might be rationalized by the characters.

The relation between drama theory and game theory is complementary in nature. Game theory does not explain how the game that is played is arrived at – i.e., how players select a small number of players and strategies from the virtually infinite set they could select, and how they arrive at common knowledge about each other's selections and preferences for the resulting combinations of strategies. Drama theory tries to explain this, and also to explain how the 'focal point' is arrived at for the 'game with a focal point' that is finally played. On the other hand, drama theory does not explain how players will act when they finally have to play a particular 'game with a focal point', even though it has to make assumptions about this. This is what game theory tries to explain and predict.

'''Edward Purcell Mellon''' (1875-1953) was an American architect, particularly active in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania.

==Early life==
Edward Purcell Mellon was born in 1875, the son of Thomas Alexander "Tom" Mellon (and grandson of [[Thomas Mellon]] founder of [[Mellon Bank]]), and his wife Mary C. Caldwell, the sister of [[Alexander Caldwell]], U.S. Senator for Kansas. His brother was Thomas Alexander Mellon II.

==Career==
In 1919, he designed ''Villa Maria'' in Meadow Lane, [[Southampton (village), New York|Southampton]], Long Island, New York, as a holiday home for his family.&lt;ref name="Spanburgh2015" /&gt; 

In 1921, his uncles, [[Andrew W. Mellon]] and [[Richard B. Mellon]], wanted him to design the main buildings, including what is now known as the [[Cathedral of Learning]] for the [[University of Pittsburgh]] for which they were the main benefactors. The new university chancellor [[John Gabbert Bowman]] thought Mellon's work was a "waste" but paid him, and eventually engaged [[Charles Klauder]] in February 1924.&lt;ref name="Geiger2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger L.

==Notable buildings==
*The Gulf Building, now [[Gulf Tower]] (1932), Pittsburgh, in association with [[Trowbridge &amp; Livingston]]

==Personal life==
In 1940, his daughter Jane Caldwell Mellon married the New York City lawyer Craigh Leonard.&lt;ref name="Spanburgh2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sally Spanburgh|title=Southampton Cottages of South Main Street, The: The Original Hamptons Summer Colony|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c4TkCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=26 August 2015|date=25 May 2015|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-1-62619-291-1|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7462">'''Frances Orlando Jones''' (August 6, 1710{{spaced ndash}}July 9, 1785) was born in [[New Kent County, Virginia]], where she also died.

Frances married [[John Dandridge]] on July 22, 1730 in New Kent County, Virginia. Frances was the daughter of Orlando Jones and [[Martha Macon]], prosperous Virginia landowners, and she is more commonly known as the mother of the first [[First Lady of the United States]], [[Martha Washington]].

==Politics runs in the family==
Frances' father, Orlando Jones, was a [[Burgess (title)|Burgess]] for [[New Kent County]] in 1718 in the [[House of Burgesses]], the leading legislative body in [[Colonial Virginia]].  Her grandfather, Col. [[Gideon Macon]] (father of [[Martha Macon]]), was also a member of the House of Burgesses from 1696 to 1702, and was secretary to [[William Berkeley (governor)|Sir William Berkeley]], [[governor of Virginia]], during his second term in office.

Upon Col. Macon's death in 1702, his widow, Martha Woodward Macon, married [[Captain Nathaniel West]] who was also a representative in the House of Burgesses.

[[Captain Nathaniel West]] and Martha Woodward Macon West had two children.  Their daughter, Unity West, married John Dandridge's brother, [[William Dandridge]].  William Dandridge was appointed to the [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|Governor's Council]] in 1727, the highest political position available to colony residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayes|first1=Kevin J.|title=William Dandridge (1689–1744)|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Dandridge_William_1689-1744|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Virginia]]/[[Dictionary of Virginia Biography]]|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of this would suggest that Frances, her husband, and children would have been quite familiar with colonial politics.

==Childhood==
Frances, or Fanny, was born on a plantation near [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] on [[Queen's Creek]] within easy distance of the growing capital.  Frances had an older brother, Lane Jones, born in 1707, and Frances was born in 1710.  Her mother, [[Martha Macon]] Jones, died when Frances was only six years old.

Orlando Jones soon remarried.  His second wife, Mary Elizabeth William Jones, became the sole parent of the two children just three years later when Orlando Jones died.  Orlando and Mary had no children together.

A year later, Orlando's widow married John James Flourney and her stepchildren lived with them in Williamsburg.  Mary Elizabeth William Jones Flourney was their guardian, and as such, could use the income from the Queen's Creek plantation to support the two stepchildren.  The sister of the late Orlando Jones sued twice for custody of her niece and nephew, but was denied.  When Lane Jones reached the age of eighteen, he legally [[Emancipation of minors|emancipated]] himself and moved in with his aunt in Timson's Neck.

Ten months later, when Frances was sixteen, she also sued for emancipation.  She did not move in with her aunt, but instead lived with a planter in [[New Kent County|New Kent]].  Her mother's parents had been from that region and a number of Macon relatives lived there.

==Their Virginia home==
Shortly after Frances Jones married John Dandridge in New Kent County, Virginia on July 22, 1730, they moved to their new home, [[Chestnut Grove (plantation)|Chestnut Grove]].  [[John Dandridge]] became [[Supreme Court of Virginia|Clerk of Courts]] in New Kent and kept that position for the next 26 years.  He was also [[vestryman]] and [[churchwarden]] for [[St. Peter's Church (New Kent, Virginia)|St. Peter's Church]], Church of England. John was a prominent planter, and a Colonel in his military district.

The Dandridges' home, [[Chestnut Grove (plantation)|Chestnut Grove]], was on the bank of the [[Pamunkey River]] in [[New Kent County, Virginia]].  John's older brother, [[William Dandridge]] (1689–1743), lived on the opposite bank of the river with his wife [[Unity West]] Dandridge at their estate, [[Elsing Green]], in [[King William County, Virginia]]. Chestnut Grove Plantation burned down in 1926, but its former site was only four miles from the location of New Kent's current County Courthouse.

John and Frances Jones Dandridge also owned a house in [[Colonial Williamsburg|Williamsburg]] and visited there frequently.

==The Dandridge children==
John and Frances Jones Dandridge produced eight children, [[Martha Washington|Martha Dandridge]] being the eldest.  As was typical of the time, the children were educated at home, their education being considered quite liberal.  John and Frances employed a tutor for their children.  It was also quite unusual that Martha was presented to society in Williamsburg at the young age of 15.

Their daughter, Martha, first married [[Daniel Parke Custis]]. Following his death she later married [[George Washington]] and became [[First Lady of the United States of America]].

One of their sons, [[Bartholomew Dandridge]], followed in his father's footsteps and became Clerk of Courts in New Kent County.  And he, like his father, also served as both [[vestryman]] and [[churchwarden]], but at the Blisland Parish rather than the St. Peter's Parish.

There are a number of conflicting reports on the date of death for Frances Jones, but the one most commonly reported is July 9, 1785.

{{Japanese name|Hamaguchi}}
{{nihongo|'''Goryo Hamaguchi'''|濱口 梧陵|Hamaguchi Goryō|extra=June 15, 1820 – April 21, 1885}} was the seventh business owner of current [[Yamasa|Yamasa Corporation]] in Japan.

==Altruistic activities==
He saved the lives of many of his fellow villagers of Hiro, [[Kii Province]] (current [[Hirogawa, Wakayama]]), when a [[1854 Ansei-Nankai earthquake|massive tsunami]] struck the [[Kii Peninsula]] in 1854. He set fire to stacks of rice sheaves as landmarks to guide villagers to safety. [[Lafcadio Hearn]] wrote a story about him in ''Gleanings in Buddha-Fields: Studies of Hand and Soul in the Far East'' (1897), called "Inamura no Hi: The burning rice fields".&lt;ref&gt;First published in 1897 by Houghton, Mifflin (Boston). Later published in the U.S. by [[Sara Cone Bryant]] in 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The story chronicled Goryo's heroism and accounts of his efforts were introduced into Japanese textbooks.

Hamaguchi participated in recovery efforts in Hiro, including the construction of a seawall more than 600 meters long, 20 meters wide and 5 meters high, which minimized damage from tsunamis in later years. He spent his own money on the project (the equivalent of 1,572 ''[[ryō (Japanese coin)|ryō]]'' (gold coins)) and hired 56,736 villagers to work on it.

In the field of education, Hamaguchi established a private academy for learning ''[[kendo]]'' (Japanese fencing) and [[Chinese classics]] with Hamaguguchi Toko and Iwasaki Meigaku at the end of the [[Edo period]]. This private academy was later called "Taikyu-Sha" and became the current Taikyu Junior High School after a few changes.

==Meiji government==
Hamaguchi became the Minister of Post and Telecommunications at the behest of [[Ōkubo Toshimichi]] in 1871 before he was elected the first chairman of the [[Wakayama Prefecture]] Assembly in 1879. After resigning as chairman, he founded the Kinokuni Doyukai (Association) and developed activities that encouraged democracy.

==Family history (from "A Short Story of Goryo Hamaguchi")==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The northwestern part of Hiro-Mura (current [[Hirogawa]]-cho) is facing the ocean and Miya-zaki (part of current Arida City) is located about 12 kilometers away right across of the bay. Kiri-saki and Ta-saki are parts of Tamura and Suhara (districts in current Yuasa-cho) along the jugged coastline between Hiro-Mura and Miya-zaki. Shira-saki (part of current Yura-cho) is located about 12 kilometer away from Hiro-Mura in the other direction. Nabae-saki and Medo-saki can be found near the area. The distance between Miya-zaki and Shira-saki is about 16 kilometer and there are Ashika-shima, Tsuru-shima and Kuro-shima in the Hidaka county side of the triangle area in the bay. Taka-shima, Karumo and Kenashi Islands are scattered in the east of those three islands like stars in night sky."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Goryo Hamaguchi described, he appreciated the beauty of his hometown in those islands and colors of waves that he could see from the village by the bay. Even though it would change the natural beauty of the village, he decided to spend a significant amount of money to build a seawall along the coastline of the village (more than 650 meters). He planted rows of adult pine trees behind the seawall to prevent damage to the village from such a natural disaster as a tsunami.

The seawall and pines trees are the symbol of the acts by this great man and the eternal message to the villagers of what life is all about. Hamaguchi set an example of overcoming any hardship with dignity and wisdom. This is how he lived in the period of [[Meiji Restoration]] when Japan was searching for a leader can bring a country to right direction.

The Hamaguchis were known as a ruling family of Hiro-Mura in Arida country over the years. They are the descendants of Yasutada of [[Taira]] who served the Lord Shiba in Owari (now called [[Aichi Prefecture]]) and later renounced his regular daily life to practice at the Hodoin Temple in [[Mt. Koya]]. During the Meio period (1492–1500), he moved to Hiro-Mura and became a believer of the ninth priest of Jitsunyo (Shonin) in the [[Honganji]] Temple sect. During the Eisho period (1504–1520), he became a Buddhist monk called Seiryo and opened his own center of practice in Hiro-Mura.

His youngest son, Masaayoshi, took over his position to represent current Anraku-ji Temple in Hirogawa-cho. Yajiro Sanekage, another son of Yasutada, started a new family and it marked the beginning of the Hagaguchi family. The family engaged in [[soy sauce]] manufacturing business at the port of Choshi in Kamifusa (currently the northern part of [[Chiba Prefecture]]) during the Genroku period (1688–1703) under Tomonao's watch. It was the foundation of [[Yamasa]] Corporation. The family tradition of using Gihei for the head of Hamagichi family started after Tomonao's tenure.

Thanks to the geographical advantage of [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba]] and other attributes related to soy sauce manufacturing, as well as dedicated efforts by the members of Hamagichi family over the generations after the first Gehei, Yamasa's business flourished during the periods of Kyoho (1716–1735) and Houreki (1751–1763). Yamasa products were gaining popularity and in a huge demand by people in Edo (now called Tokyo) because of its premier quality. 

During the Bunsei period (1818–1829), the feudal government of Japan enforced its price control for almost all products. However, Yamasa products were exempted from governmental pricing control since its product quality was superior to others; the government even gave its highest honor to Yamasa as a soy sauce manufacture.

Shichiemon, a younger brother of the fourth Gihei and the first to carry that name, started a branch family under the Hamagichi's name. Since the second Shichiemon had no child, the younger brother of the fifth Gihei became the next Shichiemon. The sixth Gihei had no child either and the first son of the third Shichiemon became a successor of the original Hamaguchi family. He was Goryo Hamaguchi. Although he was adopted to the original Hamaguchi from its branch family, the fifth Gihei was his grandfather and his stepfather was a real uncle of his. Therefore, the bloodline is intact.

The fifth Gihei, grandfather of Goryo with a great personality, was truly polite and showed his interest in variety of things. He found time to study and enjoyed fine arts when he could get away from his work. He mastered the painting style of southern Chinese school under Kaiseki Noro and used "Kampo" as his signature. Goryo admired and respected him and was well taken care of by him. In that regard, Goryo was very much influenced by his grandfather in developing his own personality.

Goryo Hamaguchi was born on June 15, 1820 in Hiro-mura. He was raised by his biological mother Shin after his father, the third Shichiemon, died at the age of 22 when he was 2 years old. In September 1831, he was adopted to the original Hamaguchi family as a successor and renamed his name to "Gita". He soon left Hiro-mura for Choshi where he started learning the family business. The Hamaguchi family (Kichiemon) had a house in Koami-cho, a Nihon-bashi district of Edo, where he stayed for a while before coming to Choshi because it was an important place for its business geographically (on the way to Choshi from Kishu). According to the Hamaguchi creed, family members were treated equally with other employees and were not allowed to fool around. One of the reasons was to learn how to handle lots of problems and to learn how to deal with people. He was not an exception and slept in the same room and ate the same dishes as other employees.

Overcoming many hardships in his early ages, he dedicated himself to the family business. At the age of 15, he celebrated his "Genko", a ceremony to be recognized as an adult, and renamed himself "Gitaro". He put lots of efforts in practicing swordsmanship and studying the [[I Ching]], as his grandfather Kampo encouraged him. Kampo died in the autumn when he turned 18.

==Friendships==
In October 1839, Goryo married a daughter of Umetaro Ikenaga in Yuasa at the age of 20. After staying in Hiro-mura for another six months, he came back to Choshi via Edo in the following spring. By the time, he already mastered techniques of martial arts, especially swordsmanship. In addition, he was very good at composing and writing poems.

He met Gonsai Miyake, who became his mentor and friend for life, in his academic quest and physical training. Gonsai was originally from Shimabara in Hizen (current [[Nagasaki Prefecture]]) and devoted himself in medical study since his birth in 1817 ([[Bunka]] 14). He studied science introduced to Japan by Dutch in Nagasaki and later moved to Edo. At that time, people were debating [[Chinese medicine]] and [[Western medicine]], until the feudal government ruled in favor of Chinese medicine because of its similar environment to Japanese.  Western medicine was prohibited until the following March.

==Death==
On April 21, 1885, Hamaguchi died in New York during his tour of Europe and the United States, which had been a long-cherished desire of his.

His funeral was held on June 15, 1885, in Hiro-Mura and more than 4,000 people gathered to pay their final respects.

'''Harry Nicholas Pritzker''' (August 1, 1892 – August 1956) was an [[United States|American]] businessman and member of the [[Pritzker family]].

==Early life and education==
Harry was the son of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Jewish]] immigrants Annie P. (née Cohn) and Nicholas J. Pritzker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DB1439F936A15752C0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Jay Pritzker, Who Built Chain Of Hyatt Hotels, Is Dead at 76 | first=Anthony | last=Ramirez | date=January 25, 1999 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RowMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Annie+Cohn+Pritzker&amp;dq=Annie+Cohn+Pritzker&amp;hl=en]&lt;/ref&gt; His father left Kiev for Chicago in 1881 and worked first as a pharmacist and then a lawyer.&lt;ref name=CNNMoney&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1988/04/25/70462/index.htm CNN Money: "THE PRITZKERS UNVEILING A PRIVATE FAMILY" By Ford S. Worthy] April 25, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; His father wrote a small book that has been passed down from Pritzker to Pritzker; the theme of the book is "Your only immortality is the impact you have on your successors."&lt;ref name=CNNMoney /&gt;

==Career==
Harry joined his father's law firm, ''Pritzker &amp; Pritzker'', along with his brothers, [[Abram Nicholas Pritzker|Abram]] and [[Jack Nicholas Pritzker|Jack]].&lt;ref name=CNNMoney /&gt; Harry specialized in criminal law, Abram (called Abe and later A. N.) specialized in business law, and Jack in real estate law.&lt;ref name=NYTDealAndMultiply&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/26/business/how-they-deal-and-multiply.html New York Times: "HOW THEY DEAL AND MULTIPLY" By Marylin Bender] February 26, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, he supported his brothers who left the firm and invested in real estate and small companies mostly in the [[Chicago]] area.&lt;ref name=CNNMoney /&gt; Harry continued to run the law firm ''Pritzker &amp; Pritzker'' which eventually became an in-house firm catering solely to the needs of the Pritzker family and its business.&lt;ref name=CNNMoney /&gt; The Pritzker brothers were very successful and amassed a considerable fortune. Using ''Pritzker &amp; Pritzker'', they shielded their earnings from taxes through a series of trusts and tax code loopholes enabling them to distribute their earnings as they chose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/December-2002/Tremors-in-the-Empire/ Chicago magazine: "Tremors in the Empire" by Shane Tritsch] December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

His brother Abram's sons continued to grow the family business eventually buying the [[Hyatt Hotel|Hyatt]] House hotel in [[Los Angeles]] in 1957 forming the cornerstone of their hotel chain. His nephew Robert created a conglomerate of a multitude of manufacturing companies which grew into the multibillion-dollar [[Marmon Group]]. Marmon was diversified to include manufacturing concerns ranging from lumber to railroad box cars and travel industry staples.  It composed half of the family's wealth. On December 25, 2007, it was announced that Warren Buffett, through [[Berkshire Hathaway]], would purchase 60% of the Marmon Group from the Pritzkers for $4.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/26/business/26deal.html New York Times: "Rapidly, Buffett Secures a Deal for $4.5 Billion" By VIKAS BAJAJ] December 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Pritzker was married to Elna Stone; they had two children: Richard S. Pritzker (born 1944-2016) and Joanne Pritzker (1946–1955). His son Richard is a real estate investor in California&lt;ref name=NYTDealAndMultiply /&gt; and had previously worked as head counsel at the Hyatt Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equinoxhotels.com/about/team Equinox Hotels: Our team] retrieved July 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

{{World trade}}

''' International trade''' is the exchange of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], [[goods]], and [[Service (economics)|services]] across [[international borders]] or territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/trade|title=Trade – Define Trade at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most countries, such [[trade]] represents a significant share of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). While international trade has existed throughout history (for example [[Uttarapatha]], [[Silk Road]], [[Amber Road]], [[scramble for Africa]], [[Atlantic slave trade]], [[salt road]]s), its economic, social, and political importance has been on the rise in recent centuries. Carrying out trade at an international level is a more complex process than domestic trade. Trade takes place between two or more nations. Factors like the economy, government policies, markets, laws, judicial system, currency, etc. influence the trade. The political relations between two countries also influences the trade between them. Sometimes, the obstacles in the way of trading affect the mutual relationship adversly. To avoid this, international economic and trade organisations came up. To smoothen and justify the process of trade between countries of different economic standing, some international economic organisations were formed. These organisations work towards the facilitation and growth of international trade.

==Characteristic of global trade==

Trading globally gives consumers and countries the opportunity to be exposed to new markets and products. Almost every kind of product can be found in the international market: food, clothes, spare parts, oil, jewelry, wine, stocks, currencies, and water. Services are also traded: tourism, banking, consulting, and transportation. A product that is transferred or sold from a party in one country to a party in another country is an [[export]] from the originating country, and an [[import]] to the country receiving that product.  Imports and exports are accounted for in a country's current account in the balance of payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bop.asp|title=Balance Of Payments (BOP)|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-25|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Silkroutes.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Ancient [[Silk Road]] [[trade routes]] across [[Eurasia]]]]

[[Industrialization]], advanced technology, including [[transport]]ation, [[globalization]], [[multinational corporation]]s, and [[outsourcing]] are all having a major impact on the international trade system. Increasing international trade is crucial to the continuance of globalization. Nations would be limited to the goods and services produced within their own borders without international trade. International trade is, in principle, not different from [[domestic trade]] as the motivation and the behavior of parties involved in a trade do not change fundamentally regardless of whether trade is across a border or not. The main difference is that international trade is typically more costly than domestic trade. This is due to the fact that a border typically imposes additional costs such as [[tariff]]s, time costs due to border delays, and costs associated with country differences such as language, the legal system, or culture.

Another difference between domestic and '''international trade''' is that [[factors of production]] such as capital and [[Labour economics|labor]] are typically more mobile within a country than across countries. Thus, international trade is mostly restricted to trade in goods and services, and only to a lesser extent to trade in capital, labour, or other factors of production. Trade in goods and services can serve as a substitute for trade in factors of production. Instead of importing a factor of production, a country can import goods that make intensive use of that factor of production and thus embody it. An example of this is the import of labor-intensive goods by the United States from China. Instead of importing Chinese labor, the United States imports goods that were produced with Chinese labor. One report in 2010 suggested that international trade was increased when a country hosted a network of immigrants, but the trade effect was weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into their new country.&lt;ref name=twsA36&gt;{{cite news

===Data===

====Official statistics====
Data on the value of exports and imports and their quantities often broken down by detailed lists of products are available in statistical collections on international trade published by the statistical services of intergovernmental and supranational organisations and national statistical institutes. The definitions and methodological concepts applied for the various statistical collections on international trade often differ in terms of definition (e.g. special trade vs. general trade) and coverage (reporting thresholds, inclusion of trade in services, estimates for smuggled goods and cross-border provision of illegal services). Metadata providing information on definitions and methods are often published along with the data.

The '''Merchants of the Steelyard''' was the [[English language|English]] name for the merchants of the [[Hanseatic League]] who first settled in London in 1250 at the [[Steelyard]] on the river-side, near Cosin Lane, now Ironbridge Wharf&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{1911|wstitle=Steelyard, Merchants of the}}&lt;/ref&gt; and established their London Kontor in 1320.  Located just west of London Bridge near [[Upper Thames Street]].  [[Cannon Street station]] occupies the site now.  It grew significantly over time into a walled community with its own warehouses, weighhouse, church, offices and houses, reflecting the importance and scale of the activity carried on.  It is first referred to as the Steelyard (der Stahlhof) in 1422.

The land and buildings still remained the property of the Hanseatic League, and were subsequently let to merchants for business purposes.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666 they were rebuilt as warehouses, and were finally sold to the South-Eastern Railway Company in 1852 by the Hanseatic towns, Lübeck, Bremen and Hamburg.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

'''Mohammad Namazi''' was the founder of [[Namazi Hospital]], which he founded in 1955 in [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]].
He was born in [[Kazerun]], in 1896. He was a wealthy person, and he lived in USA for many years.  He died in 1973.

== Life ==
Namazi was born in Shiraz. He spent his childhood in China and India, and his youth in Tehran and Shiraz. In 1924, he traveled to America, and then he decided to stay there, which lasted for more than 30 years. After a very successful economic career, he then returned to Iran to help his country. His initial intention was to improve the situation of health and education by constructing a complex. But instead, he contributed to the water supply of Shiraz. Later he founded Namazi hospital.

At the age of 76, he died in his own founded hospital.

Hochschild was an [[agnosticism|agnostic]] [[Jew]] whose family had already been active in the mining industry for over a generation. He was the eldest son of a general trader who had two cousins involved in the metal industry: brothers [[Berthold Hochschild]], who founded the [[American Metal Company]] and [[Zachary Hochschild]], a partner in [[Metallgesellschaft]].&lt;ref name=WaszkisReview&gt;{{Cite web|last=  |first=  |authorlink=   |title= A Review of Helmut Waszkis' "Dr. Moritz (Don Mauricio) Hochschild 1881-1965.

A German ]ewish Mining Entrepreneur in South America|publisher=|date= |url=https://www.mininghistoryassociation.org/Journal/MHJ-v10-2003-Hillman_rev_Waszkis.pdf |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hochschild graduated from school, he studied mining and engineering at the [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology]].&lt;ref name=papers&gt;[http://findingaids.cjh.org/index2.php?fnm=MoritzHochschild&amp;pnm=LBI Papers of Moritz Hochschild]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1905, he began his career in the field at the large industrial conglomerate [[Metallgesellschaft]].&lt;ref name=papers/&gt; and then as the company's agent in [[Spain]] and [[Australia]] and then finally moved to South America to work independently.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt;  After several years in [[Chile]], he returned to Germany and stayed there until the end of the [[World War I|first World War]].

==Career==
In 1918, he married Käthe Rosenbaum and in 1920, he returned once again to Bolivia.  In 1920, his son, Gerardo Hochschild Rosenbaum, was born; his wife died in 1924.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt; During the following two decades, Hochschild built up an economic empire in [[Bolivia]] around the mining and trade of tin ore.  His empire stretched from [[Peru]] in the north to [[Chile]] in the south.  During this period of growth, more of his family followed him to South America to work for him, including his cousin Philipp Hochschild and Philipp's wife Germaine.  Moritz (or Don Mauricio, as he was known in South America) and Germaine had an affair, and they married after Germaine divorced Philipp.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt;

The 1930s saw the peak of the Moritz Hochschild Group's economical and political influence. In 1938, using his influence with [[German Busch]], Bolivia's military president from 1937 to 1939, Hochschild pushed Bolivia to open its doors to Jewish refugees from Hitler's Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title='Bolivian Schindler' saved 9,000 Jews from Nazi Germany | website=Daily Mail Online | date=2017-03-18 | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4326068/Bolivian-Schindler-saved-9-000-Jews-Nazi-Germany.html | access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 9,000 were admitted. Hochschild also funded the transport of the refugees and their housing once they arrived in the South American country. Newspapers have called him "Bolivia's Schindler."

In both 1939 and 1944, Hochschild was arrested by the Bolivian government and sentenced to death.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt; Just two weeks after his release following his 1944 arrest, he was captured and held by kidnappers for two weeks. After he was freed he left Bolivia, never to return.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt;

In 1951, the Hochschilds donated the majority of their fortune to the ''Hochschild Trust and Foundation''.  In the following year, the Moritz Hochschild Group was [[Nationalization|nationalized]] during the [[History of Bolivia#Bolivian National Revolution|Bolivian National Revolution]]; however, they were compensated with an allotment of 30% of the company's prior assets.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt; The company, [[Hochschild Mining]], grew further and expanded worldwide.  In 1961 Hochschild inaugurated Mantos Blancos copper mine in [[Antofagasta]], [[Chile]], which became his most successful mining operation, although its best results were to come after his death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3546">The '''New Hire Registry''' is a program established in the United States pursuant to the ''Personal Responsibility and Work        Opportunity Reconciliation Act'' (PRWORA) of 1996, 42 U.S.C. 653a, which required each state, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government for its own employees, to establish - or contract with a provider to operate - a system where all new hires by any employer must be reported to a state-established New Hire Registry for that state.&lt;ref&gt;http://newhire-reporting.com/va-newhire/FAQ.aspx Virginia New-Hire Reporting Center Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), retrieved 4 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  All employers of employees for wages have been required since 1997 to register with their state for reporting, and to report new hires within 20 days of employment, except employers who file new hire reports electronically, who must file a report every 12 to 16 days. The ostensible purpose of the program is to check for "[[deadbeat parent]]s", e.g. persons not paying required child support orders, but may also be used for abuse of other payment-related programs such as [[unemployment insurance]].

==Who is required to comply==
All employers of employees for wages must register with their state's New Hire Registry, and are required to report to the registry all new hires or all rehires of former employees who have been separated from the employer for more than 60 days. All employees must be reported, including employees who were hired or worked for less than one day,  domestic employees such as a maid, gardener, cook, etc., and seasonal employees.&lt;ref&gt;http://newhire-reporting.com/md-newhire/FAQ.aspx Maryland State Directory of New Hires, Frequently Asked Questions, #4, Retrieved 4 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The law's reporting requirements strictly include all employees for wages. An employer must report all persons who would be considered employees under federal rules for withholding of employment taxes to the state's New Hire Registry. Reporting of [[independent contractor]]s is not required, but is encouraged.

While reporting of employees who are no longer working for the employer may not seem to be helpful, since the report includes the address of the employee, it may be useful in tracking down an employee who has unpaid child support payments or might be committing unemployment insurance fraud.

==Exemptions==
No employer is exempt from reporting new hires, with the exception of Federal intelligence agencies where the director of the agency has determined that reporting may jeopardize the safety of certain employees or may compromise National Security.

==Report Format==
The report which is required to be filed includes the name, address and social security number of every new hire, as well as the name, address, and [[Federal Employer Identification Number]] of the employer, for each new hire made within the last 20 days or within the last two weeks for employers filing electronically.

==Single State vs. Multistate Employers==
An employer within a single state files with the New Hire Registry of the state where they operate; multistate employers may choose to either file new hire reports with each state where the employee works, or instead may file a single combined report for all employees for all states where it operates with one state's New Hire Registry, but must not make both reports.

==Requirement of States operating the Registry==

'''Paperboard''' is a  thick [[paper]]-based material.  While there is no rigid differentiation between paper and paperboard, paperboard is generally thicker (usually over 0.30&amp;nbsp;mm, 0.012 in, or 12 points) than [[paper]] and has certain superior attributes such as foldability and rigidity. According to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards, paperboard is a paper with a [[grammage]] above 250 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but there are exceptions.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Robertson|first= Gordon L.|title=Food Packaging - Principle and Practice (2nd Ed.)|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8493-3775-8 |page=111|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paperboard can be single- or multi-ply.  

Paperboard can be easily cut and formed, is lightweight, and because it is strong, is used in [[packaging]].  Another end-use is high quality graphic printing, such as book and magazine covers or postcards.  Paperboard is also used in [[fine art]]s for creating sculptures.

Sometimes it is referred to as ''[[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]]'', which is a generic, lay term used to refer to any heavy [[pulp (paper)|paper pulp]]–based board, however this usage is deprecated in the paper, printing and packaging industries as it does not adequately describe each product type.

==History==
In 1817, the first paperboard carton was produced in [[England]]. [[Folding carton]]s first emerged around the 1860s and were shipped flat to save space, ready to be set up by customers when they were required. 1879 saw the development of mechanical die cutting and creasing of blanks. In 1911 the first [[kraft process|kraft sulphate mill]] was built in [[Florida]]. In 1915 the [[carton#Gable top|gable top]] milk carton was patented and in 1935 the first [[dairy#Industrial processing|dairy plant]] was observed using them. Ovenable paperboard was introduced in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paperboard Packaging Alliance |title=Paperboard Packaging |accessdate=2009-07-18 |url=http://www.paperboardpackaging.org/student_design_challenge/syllabus/1-%20History%20of%20Paperboard.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121092805/http://www.paperboardpackaging.org/student_design_challenge/syllabus/1-%20History%20of%20Paperboard.pdf |archivedate=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology and classification==
[[File:Pakje sigaretten.JPG |thumb| Crush-proof [[Cigarette pack]] made of folding boxboard.]]
Terminology and classifications of paperboard are not always uniform.  Differences occur  depending on specific industry,  locale, and personal choice.   In general, the following are often used:&lt;ref&gt;[[ASTM]] D996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

** Corrugated medium: the inner fluted portion of corrugated fiberboard
** Linerboard: a strong stiff board for one or both sides of corrugated boxes. It is the flat covering over the corrugating medium.
* Other
** [[Binder's board]]: a paperboard used in bookbinding for making hardcovers.

==Production==
{{See also|Paper machine}}
Fibrous material is turned into pulp (paper)/pulp and bleaching of wood [[Pulp (paper)|bleached]], to create one or more layers of board, which can be optionally coated for a better surface and/or improved visual appearance. pulp board are produced on pulping machines that can handle higher grammage and several plies.

===Raw materials===
The above-mentioned fibrous material can either come from fresh (virgin) sources (e.g. wood) or from [[Paper recycling|recycled waste paper]]. Around 90% of virgin paper is made from [[timber|wood]] pulp.&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{Cite journal
|last=Datamonitor
|title=Global Paper and Paperboard - Industry Profile

|ref=0199-2406
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today paperboard packaging in general, and especially products from [[ecolabel|certified]] [[sustainability|sustainable]] sources, are receiving new attention, as manufacturers dealing with environmental, health, and regulatory issues look to [[renewable resources]] to meet increasing demand. It is now mandatory in many countries for paper-based packaging to be manufactured wholly or partially from [[recycling|recycled]] material.
 
Raw materials include:

* '''[[Hardwood]]:''' C. {{convert|0.05|in|mm}} in length e.g. [[Birch]] which has short fibres. It is generally more difficult to work with; however, it does provide higher tensile strength, but lower tear and other strength properties. Although its fibres are not as long and strong as those in softwood, they make for a stiffer product defined by some stifness tests.  Hardwood fibres fill the sheet better and therefore make a smoother paper that is more opaque and better for printing.  Hardwood makes an excellent corrugating medium.
*'''[[Softwood]]:''' C.  {{convert|0.13|in|mm}} in length e.g. [[Pine]] and [[spruce]] which have typically long fibres and make superior paperboard in services where strength is important.  Softwood makes excellent linerboard.
* '''[[Deinked pulp|Recycled]]:''' Used paper is collected and sorted and usually mixed with virgin fibres in order to make new material. This is necessary as the recycled fibre often loses strength when reused; the added virgin fibres enhance strength. Mixed waste paper is not usually [[Deinking|deinked]] (skipping the deinking stage) for paperboard manufacture and hence the [[pulping|pulp]] may contain traces of inks, adhesives, and other residues which together give it a grey colour. Products made of recycled board usually have a less predictable composition and poorer functional properties than virgin fibre-based boards.&lt;ref name="igg"&gt;{{Cite journal

* '''[[Tree-free paper|Others]]''': It is also possible to use the fibres of [[Bagasse|Sugarcane Bagasse]], [[Straw]], [[Hemp]], [[Cotton]], [[Flax]], [[Kenaf]], [[Abaca]] and other plant products

===Pulping===
{{Main article|Pulp (paper)}}
Two principal methods for extracting fibres from their sources are:

* '''[[Chemical pulp]]ing''' uses chemical solutions to convert wood into pulp, yielding around 30% less than mechanical pulping; however, pulp made by the kraft process has superior strength
* '''[[Thermo mechanical pulp]]''' is a two-stage process which results in a very high yield of wood fibres at the expense of strength.

====Bleaching====
{{Main article|Bleaching of wood pulp}}
Pulp used in the manufacture of paperboard can be [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleached]] to decrease colour and increase purity. Virgin fibre pulp is naturally brown in colour, because of the presence of [[lignin]]. Recycled paperboard may contain traces of [[ink]]s, [[Adhesive|bonding agents]] and other residue which colors it grey.
Although [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching]] is not necessary for all end-uses, it is vital for many graphical and packaging purposes. There are various methods of [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching]], which are used according to a number of factors for example, the degree of colour change required, chemicals chosen and method of treatment. There are three categories of [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching methods]]:

* Bleaching by '''delignification''' using [[chlorine gas]], which is a method that has been largely replaced by procedures which are gentler to the environment such as the use of oxygen as a replacement for the chlorine gas.	
* Bleaching by '''[[oxidation]]''' using chemicals such as [[chlorine dioxide]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] or [[sodium hypochlorite]].
* Bleaching by '''[[redox|reduction]]''' using chemicals such as [[sodium bisulphite]].&lt;ref name="igg"/&gt;

===Plies===
[[Image:Single vs multiply.svg|thumb|100px|(1)&amp;nbsp;single-ply vs. (2)&amp;nbsp;multi-ply]]Multi-ply paperboard generally has higher creasing and folding performance than single-ply as a result of layering different types of pulp into a single product. In cases where the same kind of pulp is being used in several layers, each separate layer is treated and shaped individually in order to create the highest possible quality.&lt;ref name="igg"/&gt;

===Coating===
In order to improve whiteness, smoothness and gloss of paperboard, one or more layers of [[Coating and printing processes|coating]] is applied. [[Coated paper]] is usually made up of:

* a [[pigment]], which could be [[china clay]], [[calcium carbonate]] or [[titanium dioxide]], usually a combination of two
* an adhesive or binder as [[styrene-butadiene]] emulsions or [[starch]]es and [[water]].

Additional components could be OBA ([[optical brightener|optical brightening agent]]s).&lt;ref name="kir"&gt;{{Cite book

==Grades==
The [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] Standard 19303 "Paperboard - Terms and grades" (Publication date : 2005-09) defines different grades of paperboard based on the surface treatment (first letter), the main furnish (second letter) and the colour (non-D grade) or bulk (D grade only) (numbering).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! First letter&lt;br&gt;(surface treatment)
! Second letter&lt;br&gt;(main furnish)
! Number
|-
|
* A = cast-coated
* G = pigment coated
* U = uncoated
| 
* Z = bleached virgin chemical pulp
* C = virgin mechanical pulp
* N = unbleached virgin chemical pulp
* T = recycled/secondary fibre with white, cream or brown reverse
* D = recycled/secondary fibre with grey back
| 
All except D grades:
# white reverse side
# cream reverse side
# brown  reverse side

D grades only:
# bulk ≥ 1.45&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g
# 1.3&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g&amp;nbsp;&lt; bulk &lt;&amp;nbsp;1.45&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g
# bulk ≤ 1.3&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g
|}

'''Example: '''  GC1 would be a "pigment coated", "virgin mechanical pulp" board with a "white reverse side". Often the used paperboard type would be FBB, which was coated on both sides.

==Common terms==
'''Basis Weight (US):''' Is the weight in {{convert|1000|sqft|m2}} of paperboard.

'''Brightness:''' Brightness is a technical term that is defined as the amount of blue-white light that a paper reflects.&lt;ref name="twe"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property is very subjective and individual to each buyer and end use, as skin colour and food are better reproduced on ‘warm’ (yellow) whites and not blue whites.

'''Grammage:''' The [[grammage]] of the paperboard is assessed in accordance ISO 536.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |author=ISO: International Organisation for Standardisation
  |year=1995
  |title=Paper and board -- Determination of grammage
  |accessdate=2009-07-18
  |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=20674}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Grammage expresses mass per unit area and is measured in g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="twe"/&gt;

'''PH:''' Surface [[pH]] is measured on a water extract and is on a scale of 0–14. 0 is [[acidic]], 7 is neutral and 14 is [[alkaline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Iggesund Paperboard |year=2008 |title=Product Catalogue: General Technical Information |accessdate=2009-07-18 |url=http://www.iggesund.com/Main.aspx?ID=d3f6ae98-6286-435d-bf6d-99a7ca881cab |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713004736/http://www.iggesund.com/Main.aspx?ID=d3f6ae98-6286-435d-bf6d-99a7ca881cab |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stiffness:''' Stiffness is one of the most important properties of paperboard as it affects the ability of cartons to run smoothly through the machine that erects, fills and closes them. Stiffness also gives strength and reduces the propensity of a carton to bulge under the weight of settling flowable contents such as cereals.

Although most paper strength properties increase with increasing sheet density, stiffness does not.  A rule of thumb is that stiffness is proportional to the 1.6 power of sheet caliper.

The species of fiber used has an effect on stiffness, other things being equal.  Northern softwood species impart superior stiffness compared to southern softwoods.

Other factors which affect board stiffness include coatings and moisture content.&lt;ref name="twe"/&gt;

'''Smoothness:''' Smoothness is particularly important when being used for printing, the smoother the paperboard, the better the image quality,  because of better ink coverage. Smoothness is measured using air leak methods – the greater the rate of air leakage, at a specific air pressure, from under a cylindrical knife placed on the surface, the rougher the surface.&lt;ref name="twe"/&gt;

'''Caliper/Thickness:''' In the [[United States]] caliper is usually expressed in thousandths of an inch (0.001”) or points, where a sheet of paperboard with a thickness of 0.024” would be 24 points. In [[Europe]] it is often sold in g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, however the thickness of the board is measured in [[micron]] (μm).

Paperboard also tends to be referred to with thickness rather than weight.&lt;ref name="kir"/&gt;

'''Whiteness:''' It refers ideally to the equal presence of all colours, because a truly white sheet will reflect all [[wavelengths]] of visible light equally.&lt;ref name="twe"/&gt;

==Paperboard industry==

The paperboard sector is mainly looked at in conjunction with the paper industry. The Paper &amp; Paperboard market size (2007) had a value of 630.9 billion USD and a volume of 320.3 million metric tons.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; Of that market 40.1% is European. About 50% of all produced paper is used for packaging, followed by printing and writing.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; According to ProCarton, the consumption of paper and paperboard seem to correlate with economic trends (GDP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Peter Ince |year=1999–2000 |title=Paper, Paperboard and Woodpulp – Production, Consumption and Trade ECE/FAO Forest Products Annual Market Review |accessdate=2009-07-18 |url=http://www.unece.org/timber/docs/rev-00/12.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605234531/http://www.unece.org/timber/docs/rev-00/12.pdf |archivedate=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Over 1,100 printers produce 5.4 million tonnes of cartonboard yearly. Cartons make up one third of paper and board packaging and 15% of all packaging. A bit more than half (54%) of the European carton is produced using recovered fibre or waste paper.
The paper and paperboard industry is quite energy and capital intensive. Just a coated board machine itself can cost around 90 - 120 million Euros&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

(about 125 - 166 million USD in 11/2011). Economies of scale apply, because of which a few large players often dominate the market place. E.g. in North America the top 5 producers have a market share of 85%.

The '''Park Avenue Historic District''' is a [[Historic districts in the United States|historic district]] located in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], along Park Avenue between Adams St. and I-75. The district includes the [[Detroit Women's City Club|Women's City Club]], the [[Detroit Building]], and the [[Park Avenue House (Detroit, Michigan)|Park Avenue House]]. The district was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1996&lt;ref name="state"/&gt; and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

==History==
In the 1920s, Detroit's prestigious [[Grand Circus Park Historic District|Grand Circus Park]] was crowded with buildings.&lt;ref name="city"&gt;[http://www.ci.detroit.mi.us/historic/districts/park_ave.pdf Park Avenue Historic District] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011151649/http://www.ci.detroit.mi.us/historic/districts/park_ave.pdf |date=2007-10-11 }} from the city of Detroit.&lt;/ref&gt; The automotive boom in the city increased the pressure for office space, and development began to spill north from Grand Circus Park up Park Avenue.&lt;ref name="city"/&gt; In 1922, [[Albert Kahn (architect)|Albert Kahn]] designed the [[Park Avenue Building (Detroit, Michigan)|Park Avenue Building]], located at the entrance to Park Avenue (but included in the neighboring [[Grand Circus Park Historic District]]). Other architects and artisans contributed hotels, apartment buildings, and office buildings to the structures on Park Avenue.&lt;ref name="city"/&gt;

In 1923, the Park Avenue Association was formed.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;[http://www.mcgi.state.mi.us/hso/sites/12438.htm Park Avenue Historic District] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606141151/http://www.mcgi.state.mi.us/hso/sites/12438.htm |date=2011-06-06 }} from the state of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; They planned the street to concentrate high-grade commercial and office space at the south end, and prestigious residential development at the north end.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt; As the district developed, Detroiters consciously perceived it as their city's version of New York City's [[Fifth Avenue]].&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;

Also on Park Avenue was [[Detroit Women's City Club|Women's City Club]] and the Detroit chapter of the [[Colony Club]], both critical in providing women with social and work activities and supporting women's suffrage.&lt;ref name="city"/&gt;

The area was used decreasingly during the [[Great Depression]], but saw a resurgence after [[World War II]], with a mix of social groups and multiple restaurant and entertainment venues.&lt;ref name="city"/&gt; At the same time, an industrial character was added to the district when the [[Iodent]] Chemical Company began manufacturing toothpaste in a building along Park Avenue.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt; The proximity of the [[Fox Theatre (Detroit, Michigan)|Fox Theatre]] and other nearby venues (including [[Comerica Park]]) has led to increased redevelopment in the 2000s.&lt;ref name="city"/&gt; The Iodent Building has been redeveloped into lofts, the Colony Club has been refurbished, and two new entertainment venues, Cliff Bell's and the Park Bar, have opened.&lt;ref name="modelD"&gt;[http://www.modeldmedia.com/developmentnews/detlife12708.aspx Kelli B. Kavanaugh,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509162616/http://www.modeldmedia.com/developmentnews/detlife12708.aspx |date=2008-05-09 }} "Detroit Life Building to join ranks of Park Ave.'s resurgence," ModelD, January 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The district was listed on the state register of historic places in 1996, and on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;

==Historic structures==
The Park Avenue Historic District contains thirteen buildings. Two of these (the [[Detroit Women's City Club|Women's City Club]] and the [[Park Avenue House (Detroit, Michigan)|Park Avenue House]]) are separately listed on the National Register. Two additional buildings on either side of Park Avenue at West Adams (the [[Park Avenue Building (Detroit, Michigan)|Park Avenue Building]] and the [[Kales Building]]), are located within the [[Grand Circus Park Historic District]], and thus not included in this district.&lt;ref name = "nom"&gt;{{citation | title = NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES REGISTRATION FORM: Park A venue Historic District | author = James John Nicita | date = December 3, 1996 | url = https://catalog.archives.gov/OpaAPI/media/25340904/content/electronic-records/rg-079/NPS_MI/97000396.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Park Row''' is a street located in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]], [[Civic Center, Manhattan|Civic Center]], and [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] neighborhoods of the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]].  The street runs east-west, sometimes called north-south because the western end is nearer to [[Downtown Manhattan]]. At the north end of Park Row is the confluence of [[Bowery]], [[East Broadway (Manhattan)|East Broadway]], St. James Place, Oliver Street, [[Mott Street]], and [[Worth Street]] at [[Chatham Square]]. At the street's south end, [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], [[Vesey Street]], Barclay Street, and [[Ann Street (Manhattan)|Ann Street]] intersect. The intersection includes a bus turnaround loop designated as [[Millennium Park (Manhattan)|Millennium Park]]. Park Row was once known as Chatham Street; it was renamed Park Row in 1886, a reference to the fact that it faces [[City Hall Park]], the former New York Common.

==Early history==
In the late 18th century [[Boston Post Road|Eastern Post Road]] became the more important road connecting New York to [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and [[New England]]. This section of the road which became Park Row was called Chatham Street,&lt;ref name=NYT19830622&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1893/06/22/109701593.pdf |title=Outrages by 'Pullers in' | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 22, 1893 | page=2 | quote=About forty years ago the original Harris Cohen established a second-hand clothing store at the corner of Baxter Street and Park Row (then Chatham Street).}}&lt;/ref&gt; a name that enters into the city's history on numerous occasions.

[[File:Printing House Square, New York City.png|thumb|left|325px|Printing House Square in 1868]]
[[File:ParkRow.jpg|thumb|left|325px|Park Row after 1905. Buildings from bottom left clockwise are: New York City Hall; the [[New York World Building]], also known as the Pulitzer Building (with spherical top) which housed the ''[[New York World]]'' newspaper (now the site of one of the Brooklyn Bridge entrance ramps); the 1873 [[New Yorker Staats-Zeitung]] Building, also later demolished; the [[New York Tribune Building]] with the [[spire]] top (today the site of the Pace Plaza complex of [[Pace University]]); the [[41 Park Row|New York Times Building]] (19th century home of ''[[The New York Times]]'', today a building of [[Pace University]]); and, cut off from the picture, the [[Potter Building]].]]

The [[tobacco industry]] in New York City got its start in 1760, when [[Pierre Abraham Lorillard|Pierre Lorillard]] opened a [[snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] factory on Chatham Street,&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace (1999), p.1046&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1795, the Long Room of Abraham Martling's Tavern on Chatham Street was one of the first headquarters used by the [[Tammany Hall|Tammany Society]] and the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] on election days. Those who gathered there became known as "Martling Men", "Tammanyites" or "Bucktails", especially during the time that Tammany was attempting to wrest control of the party away from governor [[De Witt Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace (1999), pp.322,424&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1780s, Chatham Street was the site of the Tea Water Pump, a privately owned company which took water from Fresh Water Pond, the city's only supply of fresh water, and which remained purer longer than some of the other sources which drew from the pond.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace (1999), p.360&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatham Street was also a center for entertainment. In 1798, [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] designed the 2,000-seat Park Theater on Chatham Street, intended to attract the upper classes of the city.  The theater cost $130,000 to build, and tickets were 25 cents for seats in the gallery, and 50 cents in the orchestra.  In the early 1800s, more taverns, theaters and small hotels on the street started to offer free entertain to attract customers to drink. These were called "free and easies", "varieties" or "vaudeville" and offered numerous different kinds of performances: comedy, dance, dramatic skits, magic, music,  ventriloquism, and tellers of tall tales.  New theaters such as the Chatham Theater sprang up as well to attract the overflow from the entertainment strip on the Bowery.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace (1999), pp.375,404,642&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Boxing]] was also a popular entertainment.  The Arena on Park Row packed in fans with its nightly presentation of "the manly art".&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace (1999), p.755&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatham Street was also the site of several anti-African American incidents, as in the [[Draft Riots]] of 1863, in which rioters were repulsed in their attempt to attack black waiters at Crook's Restaurant on the street.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace (1999), p.890&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1800s, Chatham Street had a bazaar-like atmosphere from the many used clothing shops and [[pawnbroker]]ages open by recently immigrated Jews from Germany and central Europe. This gave rise to [[anti-Semitic]] caricatures, although many New Yorkers could not distinguish German Jews from other Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace (1999), pp.740,749&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Civil War]], [[Joseph Pulitzer]], later the publisher of the ''[[New York World]]'' newspaper, but then a recent immigrant from [[Hungary]] who had volunteered to serve in the [[Union Army|Union]] [[cavalry]], was thrown out of the elegant French's Hotel on Chatham Street at Frankfort Street. In 1888, Pulitzer bought the hotel and had it razed in order to build a new headquarters for the ''World''. The [[New York World Building]] &amp;ndash; also known as the "Pulitzer Building" &amp;ndash; designed by [[George Browne Post]], opened in 1890, with the governor and the mayor in attendance to celebrate the 309-foot tallest building in the world, topped by a gilded dome, the first building in the city to be taller than [[Trinity Church (New York City)|Trinity Church]]. Pulitzer's own semi-circular office was at the top of the building and featured [[fresco]]es on the ceiling, embossed leather walls, and three large windows.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace (1999), p.1051&lt;/ref&gt; The ''World'' folded in 1931, to become part of the ''[[New York World Telegram]]'', then the ''[[New York World-Telegram &amp; Sun]]'', and, finally, in 1966, the ''[[New York World Journal Tribune]]'', which represented the amalgamation of seven previously independent competing newspapers. The World Building became just another office building,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite fednyc}}, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; which was torn down in 1955 to make way for an expanded car ramp to the Brooklyn Bridge.

Chatham Street was no stranger to poverty. In 1890, [[Jacob Riis]] revealed in ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'' that over 9,000 homeless men lodged nightly on Chatham Street and the Bowery, between City Hall and the [[Cooper Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace (1999), p.1182&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benjamin Franklin statue by Ernst Plassman (1872).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ernst Plassman]]'s statue of [[Benjamin Franklin]]]]

During the late 19th century, Chatham Street was [[nickname]]d '''Newspaper Row''', as most of New York City's newspapers located on the street to be close to [[New York City Hall|City Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, Richard F. (Marcdh 20, 1987) [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED9133CF933A15750C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 "Seeing the Evolution of New York City Through Artists' Eyes"], ''[[The New York Times]]''. Accessed February 24, 2008. "There are murals of ''City Hall, Newspaper Row,'' or Park Row and Nassau Street, at the century's turn the home of New York newspaperdom."&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the 19th century most of the Manhattan portion of the street was suppressed, the Commons became [[City Hall Park]], and the stub of a street was renamed Park Row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite naming|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the building of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], Park Row was the site of the large [[Park Row (BMT station)|Park Row Terminal]] for the elevated trains and cable-hauled shuttle cars which crossed the bridge. Service was gradually reduced from 1913 to 1940, and the terminal was demolished in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Sparberg, Andrew "Park Row" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}, p.977&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the southern section of the street was known as '''Printing House Square'''. Today, a statue of [[Benjamin Franklin]] by [[Ernst Plassman]] stands there, in front of the [[One Pace Plaza]] and [[New York Times Building (41 Park Row)|41 Park Row]] buildings of [[Pace University]], holding a copy of his ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette (newspaper)|Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', a reminder of what Park Row once was.

==Structures==
''[[The New York Times]]'' was originally located at 113 [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]] in 1851. It moved to 138 Nassau Street in 1854, and in 1858 it moved a little more than one block away to 41 Park Row, possibly making it the first newspaper in New York City housed in a building built specifically for its use.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlap, David W. (November 14, 2001) [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DF1F38F937A25752C1A9679C8B63 "150th Anniversary: 1851–2001; Six Buildings That Share One Story"], ''[[The New York Times]]''. Accessed October 10, 2008. "Surely the most remarkable of these survivors is 113 Nassau Street, where the New-York Daily Times was born in 1851.... After three years at 113 Nassau Street and four years at 138 Nassau Street, The Times moved to a five-story Romanesque headquarters at 41 Park Row, designed by Thomas R. Jackson. For the first time, a New York newspaper occupied a structure built for its own use."&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Times Building, which was designed by [[George B. Post]], was designated a New York City landmark in 1999.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt; The building is now used by Pace University.&lt;ref name=aia&gt;{{cite aia5}}, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New Yorker Staats-Zeitung]]'' moved to its own building at [[:File:New Yorker Staats Zeitung Building 1858.jpg|17 Chatham Street]] at very nearly the same time as the ''Times'' moved into its new building.&lt;ref name="Epitome"&gt;''An Epitome of the New-Yorker Staats-Zeitung's Sixty-Five Years of Progress''.  1899.  Complimentary pamphlet prepared and distributed by the ''Staats-Zeitung'' to describe its history and new press capacity.  This source indicates that the ''Staats-Zeitung'' was publishing from its building on Chatham Street no later than April 1858, and possibly as early as a year prior to that.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace (1999), p.943&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first structures to be called a [[skyscraper]], the [[Park Row Building]] (also known as 15 Park Row) is located at the western end of Park Row, opposite [[City Hall Park]]. Designed by noted architect [[R. H. Robertson]], and built in 1896-99, It was designated a city landmark in 1999.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt; At {{convert|391|ft}} tall it was the tallest office building in the world from 1899 until 1908, when it was surpassed by the [[Singer Building]]. The building is 29 stories tall, with 26 full floors and two, three-story cupolas. It has a frontage of {{convert|103|ft|m|abbr=on}} on Park Row, 23 on Ann Street and {{convert|48|ft|m}} on Theater Alley. The base of the building covers a land area of approximately {{convert|15000|sqft|m2}}.

The [[Potter Building]] at 38 Park Row (145 Nassau Street) was built in 1882-86 and designated a New York City landmark in 1996. It was built after the owner's previous building on the site burned down. The Potter Building was converted into apartments between 1979 and 1981.&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York City Police Department]] is headquartered at [[1 Police Plaza]] located on Park Row, across the street from the [[Manhattan Municipal Building]]&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Buckley, Cara. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/24/nyregion/24police.html?scp=1&amp;sq=%22park+row%22+%22police+plaza%22&amp;st=nyt "Chinatown Residents Frustrated Over Street Closed Since 9/11"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 24, 2007. "The Police Department says that most of Park Row has to be blocked off to protect its headquarters, called One Police Plaza, against terrorist threats, particularly truck bombs."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York|Metropolitan Correctional Center]].

Two apartment buildings of significance on Park Row are the Chatham Towers at no. 170, built in 1965 and designed by Kelly &amp; Gruzen, which, according to the ''[[AIA Guide to New York City]]'', makes a "strong architectural statement...[which] rouses great admiration and great criticism," and Chatham Green at 185 Park Row, built in 1961 and also designed by Kelly &amp; Gruzen.&lt;ref name=aia2&gt;{{cite aia5}}, p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police Plaza closure==

The segment of Park Row between Frankfort Street and [[Chatham Square]] is only open to [[New York City Bus|MTA buses]] and government and emergency vehicles. The section of Park Row has been closed to civilian traffic since the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The NYPD asserts that this is necessary to protect its headquarters from a truck bomb attack. Chinatown residents are increasingly frustrated at the disruption caused by the closure of the thoroughfare, especially nearby residents. People who live nearby argue that the police department has placed a chokehold on an entire neighborhood and suggest One Police Plaza be moved from a residential area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Hogarty, Dave |url=http://gothamist.com/2007/09/24/park_row_paraly.php |title=Park Row Paralysis |newspaper=[[Gothamist]] |date=September 24, 2007 |accessdate=March 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521042339/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/24/park_row_paraly.php |archivedate=May 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Civic Center Residents Coalition have been fighting the security perimeter around the building for years.

The NYPD has stated that it will not move despite the numerous complaints from residents, explaining that they had tried to alleviate the impact of the security measures by forbidding officers from parking in nearby public spaces and reopening a stairway that skirts the headquarter's south side and leads down to street level near the Brooklyn Bridge. The department also plans to redesign its guard booths and security barriers to make them more attractive, and was involved in efforts to convert two lanes of Park Row into a [[Greenway (landscape)|cycling and pedestrian greenway]]&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; which opened in June, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Spivack, Carol |url=https://patch.com/new-york/lower-east-side-chinatown/park-row-bike-pedestrian-paths-reopens-after-9-11-closure | title=park-row-bike-pedestrian-paths-reopens-after-9-11-closure |newspaper=[[Patch Media|patch]] |date=June 22, 2018 | accessdate = July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marguerite''' "'''Peggy'''" '''Guggenheim''' (August 26, 1898 – December 23, 1979) was an American [[art collector]], bohemian and socialite. Born to the wealthy New York City [[Guggenheim family]], she was the daughter of [[Benjamin Guggenheim]], who went down with the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] in 1912, and the niece of [[Solomon R. Guggenheim]], who would establish the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]]. Peggy Guggenheim created a noted art collection in Europe and America primarily between 1938 and 1946. She exhibited this collection as she built it and in 1949, settled in Venice, where she lived and exhibited her collection for the rest of her life. The [[Peggy Guggenheim Collection]] is a modern art museum on the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy, and is one of the most visited attractions in Venice.

==Early life: inheritance, involvement in the art/writing community==
Both of Peggy's parents were of [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] descent. Her mother, Florette Seligman (1870–1937), was a member of the [[Seligman family]]. When she turned 21 in 1919, Peggy Guggenheim inherited US$2.5 million, about US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2.5|1919|r=1}}}} million in today's currency. Guggenheim's father, [[Benjamin Guggenheim]], a member of the [[Guggenheim family]], died in the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], and he had not amassed the fortune of his siblings; therefore her inheritance was far less than the vast wealth of her cousins.

She first worked as a clerk in an avant-garde bookstore, the Sunwise Turn, where she became enamored of the members of the [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] artistic community. In 1920 she went to live in Paris, France. Once there, she became friendly with [[avant-garde]] writers and artists, many of whom were living in poverty in the [[Montparnasse]] quarter of the city. [[Man Ray]] photographed her,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/RP-F-F17662 Rijks Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; and was, along with [[Constantin Brâncuși]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], a friend whose art she was eventually to promote.

She became close friends with writer [[Natalie Barney]] and artist [[Romaine Brooks]], and was a regular at Barney's stylish [[salon (gathering)|salon]]. She met [[Djuna Barnes]] during this time, and in time became her friend and patron. Barnes wrote her best-known novel, ''Nightwood,'' while staying at the Devon country house, Hayford Hall, that Guggenheim had rented for two summers.

Peggy urged [[Emma Goldman]] to write her autobiography and helped to secure funds for her to focus in [[Saint-Tropez|Saint-Tropez, France]], on writing her two volume ''[[Living My Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/emma-goldman-living-my-life#toc59|title=Living My Life {{!}} The Anarchist Library|website=theanarchistlibrary.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collecting, before World War II==
In January 1938, Guggenheim opened a gallery for modern art in London featuring [[Jean Cocteau]] drawings in its first show, and began to collect works of art. Guggenheim often purchased at least one object from each of her exhibitions at the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/35396116|title=Peggy Guggenheim : a collector's album|last=Laurence,|first=Tacou-Rumney,|publisher=|year=|isbn=2080136100|location=Paris|pages=84|oclc=35396116}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the outbreak of [[World War II]], she purchased as much abstract and [[Surrealist]] art as possible.&lt;ref name=Priceless&gt;Walsh, John. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/the-priceless-peggy-guggenheim-1806124.html "The priceless Peggy Guggenheim"], ''The Independent'', October 21, 2009, accessed March 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first gallery was called ''Guggenheim Jeune'', the name being ingeniously chosen to associate the epitome of a gallery, the French [[Bernheim-Jeune]], with the name of her own well known family. The gallery on 30 [[Cork Street]], next to [[Roland Penrose]]'s and [[E. L. T. Mesens]]' show-case for the Surrealist movement, the London Gallery, proved to be successful, thanks to many friends who gave advice and who helped run the gallery. [[Marcel Duchamp]], whom she had known since the early 1920s, when she lived in Paris with her first husband Laurence Vail, had introduced Guggenheim to the art world; it was through him that she met many artists during her frequent visits to Paris. He taught her about contemporary art and styles, and he conceived several of the exhibitions held at ''Guggenheim Jeune''.

The Cocteau exhibition was followed by exhibitions on [[Wassily Kandinsky]] (his first one-man-show in England), [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Wolfgang Paalen]] and several other well-known and some lesser-known artists. Peggy Guggenheim also held group exhibitions of sculpture and collage, with the participation of the now classic moderns [[Antoine Pevsner]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Henri Laurens]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]] and [[Kurt Schwitters]]. She also greatly admired the work of [[John Tunnard]] (1900–1971) and is credited with his discovery in mainstream international [[modernism]].

==Plans for a museum==
When Peggy Guggenheim realized that her gallery, although well received, had made a loss of £600 in the first year, she decided to spend her money in a more practical way. A museum for contemporary arts was exactly the institution she could see herself supporting. Most certainly on her mind also were the adventures in New York City of her uncle, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim]], who, with the help and encouragement of [[Hilla Rebay]], had created the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation two years earlier. The main aim of this foundation had been to collect and to further the production of [[abstract art]], resulting in the opening of the Museum of Non-objective Painting (from 1952: The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum) earlier in 1939 on East [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]] in Manhattan. Peggy Guggenheim closed ''Guggenheim Jeune'' with a farewell party on 22 June 1939, at which colour portrait photographs by [[Gisèle Freund]] were projected on the walls. She started making plans for a Museum of Modern Art in London together with the English [[art historian]] and [[art critic]] [[Herbert Read]]. She set aside $40,000 for the museum's running costs. However, these funds were soon overstretched with the organisers' ambitions.

In August 1939, Peggy Guggenheim left for Paris to negotiate loans of artworks for the first exhibition. In her luggage was a list drawn up by Herbert Read for this occasion. Shortly after her departure the Second World War broke out, and the events following 1 September 1939 made her abandon the scheme, willingly or not. She then "decided now to buy paintings by all the painters who were on Herbert Read's list. Having plenty of time and all the museum's funds at my disposal, I put myself on a regime to buy one picture a day."&lt;ref&gt;Guggenheim (1979), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;
When finished, she had acquired ten [[Pablo Picasso|Picassos]], forty [[Max Ernst|Ernsts]], eight [[Joan Miró|Mirós]], four [[René Magritte|Magrittes]], three [[Man Ray]]s, three [[Salvador Dalí|Dalís]], one [[Paul Klee|Klee]], one [[Wolfgang Paalen]] and one [[Marc Chagall|Chagall]] among others. In the meantime, she had also made new plans and in April 1940 had rented a large space in the Place Vendôme as a new home for her museum.

A few days before the Germans reached Paris, Peggy Guggenheim had to abandon her plans for a Paris museum, and fled to the south of France, from where, after months of safeguarding her collection and artist friends, she left Europe for New York in the summer of 1941. There, in the following year, she opened a new gallery which actually was in part a museum at 30 [[West 57th Street]]. It was called [[The Art of This Century Gallery]]. Three of the four galleries were dedicated to Cubist and Abstract art, Surrealism and Kinetic art, with only the fourth, the front room, being a commercial gallery. Peggy Guggenheim held important shows, such as the show for 31 Women artists, at the gallery as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/peggy-guggenheim-dead-81-modern-art-collection.html|title=Peggy Guggenheim Is Dead at 81; Known for Modern Art Collection|last=Shenker|first=Israel|date=December 24, 1979|website=Encyclopedia Titanica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her interest in new art was instrumental in advancing the careers of several important modern artists including the American painters [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[William Congdon]], the Austrian surrealist [[Wolfgang Paalen]], the sound poet [[Ada Verdun Howell]] and the German painter [[Max Ernst]], whom she married in December 1941.&lt;ref name="guggenheim-venice"&gt;[http://www.guggenheim-venice.it/inglese/museum/peggy.html Biography, Peggy Guggenheim Collection] Retrieved June 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; She had assembled her collection in only seven years.&lt;ref name=Priceless/&gt;

==The collection, after World War II==
{{main|Peggy Guggenheim Collection}}
Following [[World War II]] – and her 1946 divorce from [[Max Ernst]] – she closed The Art of This Century Gallery in 1947, and returned to Europe; deciding to live in [[Venice]], Italy. In 1948, she was invited to exhibit her collection in the disused Greek Pavilion of the [[Venice Biennale]] and in 1949 established herself in the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni ('unfinished palazzo of the lions') on the Grand Canal.&lt;ref name=Priceless/&gt;

Her collection became one of the few European collections of modern art to promote a significant number of works by Americans. In the 1950s she promoted the art of two local painters, Edmondo Bacci and Tancredi Parmeggiani. By the early 1960s, Guggenheim had almost stopped collecting art and began to concentrate on presenting what she already owned. She loaned out her collection to museums in Europe and in 1969 to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City, which was named after her uncle. Eventually, she decided to donate her home and her collection to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, a gift which was concluded ''[[inter vivos]]'' in 1976, before her death in 1979.

[[File:Pguggenheimgrave.jpg|left|thumb|Grave of Peggy Guggenheim, next to a plaque remembering her [[Lhasa Apso]]s (dogs).]]
The [[Peggy Guggenheim Collection]] is one of the most important museums in Italy for European and American art of the first half of the 20th century. Pieces in her collection embrace [[Cubism]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Abstract Expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peggy Guggenheim Collection|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/publication/peggy-guggenheim-collection|website=guggenheim.org|publisher=The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation|accessdate=14 June 2017|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peggy Guggenheim lived in Venice until her death in [[Camposampiero]] near [[Padua]], Italy, after a stroke. Her ashes are interred in the garden (later: Nasher Sculpture Garden) of her home, the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni (inside the Peggy Guggenheim Collection), next to her beloved dogs.&lt;ref name=Priceless /&gt;

==Private life==
According to both Guggenheim and her biographer [[Anton Gill]], she had a considerable sexual appetite&lt;ref name=Priceless/&gt; and it was believed that, while living in Europe, she had "slept with 1,000 men".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10076464/Thomas-Messer.html "Thomas Messer"], ''Telegraph'' obituary, 23 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed to have had affairs with numerous artists and writers, and in return many artists and others have claimed affairs with her. In her autobiography, Peggy provides the names of some of these lovers, including [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Roland Penrose]] and [[E. L. T. Mesens]].&lt;ref&gt;''Out of this Century: Confessions of an Art Addict'', Peggy Guggenheim, published by Andre Deutsch, London. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first marriage was to [[Laurence Vail]], a [[Dada]] sculptor and writer with whom she had two children, Michael Cedric Sindbad Vail (1923–1986) and [[Pegeen Vail Guggenheim]]. They divorced about 1928 following his affair with writer [[Kay Boyle]], whom he later married. Soon after her first marriage dissolved, she had an affair with [[John Ferrar Holms]], a writer with writer's block who had been a war hero.&lt;ref name=Priceless/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Karole Vail|Vail, Karole P. B.]] [https://archive.org/stream/peggyg00vail/peggyg00vail_djvu.txt ''Peggy Guggenheim: A Centennial Celebration''] Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation (1998), p. 78. {{ISBN|0-8109-6914-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in December 1939, she and [[Samuel Beckett]] had a brief but intense affair, and he encouraged her to turn exclusively to modern art.&lt;ref name=Priceless/&gt; She married her second husband, painter [[Max Ernst]], in 1941 and divorced him in 1946.&lt;ref name="guggenheim-venice" /&gt; Among her eight grandchildren is [[Karole Vail]], who was appointed director of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Barone, Joshua.

==Portrayal in popular culture==
*Peggy Guggenheim is portrayed by [[Amy Madigan]] in the movie ''[[Pollock (film)|Pollock]]'' (2000), directed by and starring [[Ed Harris]], based on the life of [[Jackson Pollock]].  
*A play by Lanie Robertson based on Peggy Guggenheim's life, ''Woman Before a Glass'', opened at the Promenade Theatre on Broadway, New York on March 10, 2005. This is a one-woman show, which focuses on Peggy Guggenheim's later life. [[Mercedes Ruehl]] played Guggenheim. Ruehl received an [[Obie award]] for her performance. In May 2011, the Abingdon Theater Arts Complex in New York features a revival of this play, starring veteran stage actress Judy Rosenblatt, directed by Austin Pendleton.
*In Bethan Roberts' first play for radio, ''My Own Private Gondolier'', Peggy Guggenheim's troubled daughter, Pegeen, leaves her three children behind when she travels to Venice to spend the summer with her mother. Pegeen is in retreat from a marriage that has failed. She is determined to be an artist, and she shuts herself up in the dank basement, trying to paint. Meanwhile, her mother, Peggy, is much more concerned with the English sculptor who has come to visit; she wants a piece of his work to add to her collection and will use everything at her disposal to achieve her aim. She will even try to coax her daughter into the plan if she thinks it will get her what she wants. Peggy is well known as a collector of men, as well as art. As the summer progresses, and the strains between mother and daughter grow, it is only Gianni, Peggy's personal Gondolier, who can provide a welcome diversion. The play was first broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] on Oct. 19, 2010. Peggy Guggenheim was played by [[Fiona Shaw]]. [[Pegeen Vail]] was played by Hattie Morahan Jack.
*In April 2015, a new [[documentary film]] ''[[Peggy Guggenheim: Art Addict]]'' began premiering at film festivals, including the [[San Francisco Jewish Film Festival]] on July 26, 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3483">'''Robert Ruliph Morgan "Ruly" Carpenter III''' (born 1940) was the principal owner and president of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] from 1972 to 1981.

==Biography==
Carpenter was born in [[Wilmington, Delaware]].  He was three years old when his grandfather, [[R. R. M. Carpenter|R. R. M. Carpenter Sr.]], bought the Phillies in 1943 and gave control of the team to his father, [[R. R. M. Carpenter, Jr.|Bob]]. He graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1962 where he earned two varsity football letters, and joined his father in the Phillies' front office in 1963. In 1965, he suggested that his father hire [[Paul Owens (baseball)|Paul Owens]], a young scout, as farm system director. Owens would eventually become [[general manager]] in 1972.

Ruly became team president at 32, when his father stepped down in the 1972 season. His tenure as owner was, statistically speaking, one of the most (if not the most) successful in franchise history.  From 1976 to 1980, the Phillies won their division in every season but one, including the team's first [[World Series]] win in [[1980 World Series|1980]].  They also won the first half National League East title in the strike-shortened 1981 season.

Soon after the World Series triumph, however, Carpenter decided to sell the team. With the advent of [[Free agent|free agency]], salaries were already starting to spiral upward, and he believed that even with his considerable wealth he needed to take on minority investors in order to stay afloat. Unwilling to have to get permission from partners in order to make major decisions, he sold the Phillies to a group headed by longtime Phillies executive [[Bill Giles (baseball)|Bill Giles]] for $32.5 million in 1981. By comparison, his grandfather had bought the team in 1943 for $400,000.

Carpenter still lives in Wilmington. He is a longtime member of the [[University of Delaware]] Board of Trustees; his family has supported the school for many years. He is still an avid Phillies fan, and closely followed the team's run to its second world title in [[2008 World Series|2008]]. He was inducted into the [[Delaware Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1987.

Carpenter's great-grandmother,  Margaretta Carpenter, was the sister of [[Pierre S. du Pont]], president of [[DuPont]] from 1915 to 1919.

'''Sophia Michahelles''' is one of the two chief artists and [[puppeteer]]s of [[Processional Arts Workshop]], makers of pageant [[puppets]] and other processional art in [[upstate New York]]. She works closely with co-director [[Alex Kahn]]. The couple's work, under the informal moniker "Superior Concept Monsters" has been commissioned each year since 1998 to lead [[New York's Village Halloween Parade]], the largest puppet [[parade]] and street-pageant of its kind in the United States, drawing two million spectators.

Many of the giant rod puppets (or "pageant" puppets) created by Michahelles and Kahn, are lit from the inside, making them suitable for night parades. They are performed by teams of puppeteers. For the 1998 Halloween parade, Michahelles worked with Kahn and his team to build five 20-foot caterpillar puppets (designed by Kahn) which transformed into giant [[Actias luna|Luna moths]]. In 2001, as a response to the attack on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], Michahelles herself designed an incandescent baby phoenix puppet for the New York parade, as a symbol of rebirth from the ashes.

Michahelles has also worked in collaboration with master puppeteer [[Basil Twist]]. She performed in Twist's [[Off-Broadway]] show ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'' (1998 and 2004) presented at Dodger Stages. The [[Obie Award]]-winning work is a water ballet of 180 puppets choreographed to the five movements of [[Hector Berlioz]]'s 1830 orchestral work. Unseen during the performance, she and the other five performers "...emerge from behind the scenes for their curtain calls... Each is wearing a wetsuit, looks exhausted, gets naked and is soaked from head to toe," according to theater critic [[Matthew Murray (writer)|Matthew Murray]] of TalkinBroadway.com.

Since 2002, Michahelles and Kahn have taught a summer workshop in pageant puppetry and processional art in the mountain village of Morinesio, located in the Italian Alps. They draw on local history as an inspiration for the artistic themes of the puppet creations and folk festivals that are part of the workshop. This process of creating locally derived, site-specific processions has become a central aspect of their work, and in 2005, they formed a non-profit entity, [[Processional Arts Workshop]], to further pursue community-based projects.

'''"The labor problem"''' is the [[economics]] term widely used toward the turn of the twentieth century with various applications.&lt;ref&gt;"the labor problem." Roberts, Harold Selig.  1994. Roberts' Dictionary of Industrial Relations. p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined in many ways, such as "the problem of improving the conditions of employment of the wage-earning classes."&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Thomas Sewall. 1908. Labor Problems: A Text Book. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  It encompasses the difficulties faced by wage-earners and employers who began to cut wages for various reasons including increased technology, desire for lower costs or to stay in business. The wage-earning classes responded with strikes, by unionizing and by committing acts of outright violence. It was a nationwide problem that spanned nearly all industries and helped contribute to modern business conditions still seen today. Possible causes include the failure to account for the negative [[externality]] of reproduction in the face of finite natural resources which results in over-supply of labor and falling living standards for wage-laborers, depersonalization by machines and poor working conditions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Time frame==
A popular debate about the labor problem is the time that it encompasses. Some characterize it back as far as the 1860s, which is when many [[trade union | unions]] and groups began to form. However there wasn’t a problem present at this time with the formation of these unions. Also, the first strike was a result of the problem between wage earners and union officials, not employers and unions or employers and wage-earners, which was the main conflict of this time.&lt;ref name=movement&gt;“The Labor Movement: A Violent Period in American History.” ILWU Local 19, n.d. Web. 5 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the problem was within unions and not between unions and employers, the Labor Problem had not yet become an issue. Many also attribute the end of the problem to the end of the 1920s. This has some merit but is also open to interpretation. Reforms began to pass to correct many of the problems but reforms continued to pass well into the 1930s, 40s and 50s. The [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954) | Civil Rights Movement]] took over in [[United States of America | America]], which brought about even further legislation. Many attribute the end of the labor problem to the late 1920s because it marks a significant drop in strikes and violence and an increase in passed legislation aimed at correcting the labor issues.

==Causes==
At the turn of the century machines were beginning to take a stronger footing in the economy, which drove costs down. Always trying to maximize profits, employers saw fit to lower wages for two main reasons. Machines were making the production process cheaper meaning wages took up a bigger percentage of costs, and when times were particularly tough, it made sense to cut wages to stay in business.&lt;ref&gt;Barbash, Jack. “"The Legal Foundations of Capitalism" and the Labor Problem.”  Journal of Economic Issues 10. 4 (1976), pp. 799-810. Online.&lt;/ref&gt; This depersonalization of the production process meant that people essentially became expendable. People were not eliminated completely but there was a significant job loss. This led to lower wages in the [[long run]] because [[fixed costs]] decreased (with increased technology) so employers saw fit to cut wage expenses for this now partially expendable labor force. Although the problem spanned many industries, they were not all concerned with the same problems. For example, the steel industry was mainly concerned with being phased out due to technological advances while other industries, namely textiles, had problems with [[child labor]] and working conditions. The variety of problems and concerns led to legislation being passed, which covered different areas and led to greater reform.

==Notable events==
Riots broke out in [[Baltimore]] in 1877 due to the negligence of union officials. It began as a railroad strike but eventually formed riots that lasted four days and killed fifty people.&lt;ref name=movement/&gt; The first strike due to depersonalization by machines was the [[Homestead Strike]] in 1892 on the [[Carnegie Steel Company]] by the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers]] (AA).&lt;ref&gt;Field 1893, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; This ultimately resulted in the attempted assassination of [[Henry Clay Frick]], Chairman of The Carnegie Steel Company, and a crushing blow in the attempt to unionize steel workers. Another example is the [[Pullman Strike]] in 1894, where almost 4,000 workers who were members of the [[American Railway Union]] (ARU) went on a strike without permission of the union to protest wage cuts by the [[Pullman Company]].&lt;ref&gt;"Pullman Strike." Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia. Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. 27 Dec. 2013. Web. 28 Dec. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; One extreme example occurred when train engineers and laborer stopped a train before it reached the station in [[New York City]], stranding men, women and children alike in the heat.&lt;ref&gt;Field 1893, pp. 61-68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

'''Victor Marie du Pont de Nemours''' (October 1, 1767 – January 30, 1827) was a [[French American]] diplomat, politician and businessman. He was a member of the [[Delaware General Assembly]], the founder of the Du Pont, Bauduy &amp; Co., wool manufacturers, and brother of [[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont]], the founder of the [[DuPont|E.I. du Pont de Nemours Company]].

==Early life and family==
Victor du Pont was born October 1, 1767 in Paris, France, son of [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours]] and Nicole Charlotte Marie Louise le Dée.  He married [[Gabrielle Joséphine de la Fite de Pelleport]] in 1794 and had five children, Amélie-Élisabeth (1796-1869), Samuel Francis (born and died 1799), [[Charles I. du Pont|Charles Irénée]] (1803-1865), [[Samuel Francis du Pont|Samuel Francis]] (1803-1865) and Julia Sophie (1806-1882).

==Professional career==
After 1784 du Pont worked with his father in [[King Louis XVI]]'s Bureau of Commerce.  There he had opportunities to travel around Europe and meet visiting friends of his father. In 1788 he began four years of work with the French minister to the United States in both New York City and Philadelphia. During this time, he wrote letters to his father [https://csac.history.wisc.edu/document-collections/european-assessments/ analyzing the U.S. Constitution] and the prospects for its ratification. Returning to Paris in 1793, he married and soon went back to the United States, this time as French Consul at [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. He remained there until 1797 when he was named French Consul-General at Philadelphia, but being refused recognition by President [[John Adams]], he returned to France.

For the next two years Victor du Pont assisted his father in his preparation for the whole family immigrating to the United States. They finally sailed on the ''American Eagle'', arriving in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], January 1, 1800. From there the father, two brothers, and wives and children, went to live at ''Goodstay,'' a house purchased for them in [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bergen Point]], [[New Jersey]]. Many ideas for future du Pont businesses were conceived in the coming year at ''Goodstay,'' including the one that had his brother, Eleuthère, beginning a gunpowder business. Victor and his brother returned to France for a year in 1801 to seek investors for that and various other prospects.  He returned to New York, established a [[trading company]], [[Victor du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.]], and acted as an agent for [[Louis Pichon]], the French Consul-General and chargé d'affairs, provisioning French troops seeking to quell the rebellion then going on in [[Santo Domingo]]. This firm went into bankruptcy in 1808, as his many advances, including those to the French government, went unreimbursed. Victor next tried his hand at farming and merchandising on the [[Genesee River]] valley of western New York.

In 1811, he moved with his family to Delaware and established residence at ''Louviers'' on the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]], across from the Eleutherian Mills of his brother. He established a woolen mill to manufacture cotton cloth. Eleuthère's partner, [[Pierre Bauduy]] and son-law-law, [[Ferdinand Bauduy]], joined the business in 1813, and it became known as Du Pont, Bauduy &amp; Co. Soon after arriving in [[Delaware]], Victor du Pont was elected to one of the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] seats in the [[Delaware House of Representatives|State House]] for the 1815, 1816, and 1817 sessions and later was elected to the [[Delaware Senate|State Senate]] for the 1821, 1822, and 1823 sessions.

==Death and legacy==
Victor du Pont died in Philadelphia on January 30, 1827, and is buried in the du Pont family cemetery near [[Greenville, Delaware]]. Victor du Pont was a man "whose friends were everywhere." His son Charles took over management of the wool manufacturing business upon his death, and his other son, Samuel Francis, was a [[Rear Admiral]] in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].
