'''Aberri Eguna''' ("Fatherland Day") is a holiday coinciding with [[Easter Sunday]] which has its roots in the [[Basque nationalism|Basque nationalist movement]]. It was first organised by the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] on 27 March 1932 in [[Bilbao]], then consisting of a demonstration of some 65,000 participants which terminted at the [[Sabino Arana|Sabino Arana House]].&lt;ref name=Kasp&gt;Kasper, M. ''Baskische Geschichte'' (1997) Primus {{ISBN|3-89678-039-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since become the unofficial Basque [[National Day|national holiday]].&lt;ref name=Kasp/&gt;

[[Image:Aberri ibarre1.jpg|thumb|Political speeches on Aberri Eguna]]

==Etymology==

''Aberri'' is a neologism coined by Sabino Arana based on the [[suffix]] ''-ba'' which occurs in numerous kinship terms (e.g. ''osaba'' "uncle", ''izeba'' "aunt", ''arreba'' "sister of a man" etc.) from which he fancifully deduced a putative root [[Asterisk#Historical_linguistics|*]]aba "father".&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;[[Larry Trask|Trask, L.]] ''The History of Basque'' (1997) [[Routledge]] {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formed numerous neologisms based on this putative word such as ''aberri'' (*aba + ''herri'' "land, people, country, settlement"), ''abizen'' "surname" (*aba + ''izen'' "name") or ''abenda'' "race" (*aba + ''enda'' "lineage").&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; From ''aberri'' he then went on the coin ''abertzale'' "patriot" (''aberri'' "fatherland" + ''-(t)zale'', a suffix denoting someone keen on something).&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; In spite of their fanciful derivation, ''aberri'' and ''abertzale'' have found their way into general usage.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Sabino arana goiri 1865-1903.JPG|thumb|Sabino Arana]]
The first Aberri Eguna was held to celebrate the anniversary of the concept of political Basque nationalism as put forward by Sabino Arana in 1882, according to his own writings.&lt;ref name=Kasp/&gt; Some claims suggest that the date was established after Arana's death.&lt;ref&gt;de la Granja Sáinz, J ''Historia y política: Ideas, procesos y movimientos sociales'' (2006) ISSN 1575-0361, Nº 15, pags. 65-116&lt;/ref&gt; However, its coinciding with Easter is deliberate as it follows the motto of the Basque Nationalist Party ''Jaungoiko eta Lege Zaharrak'' "God and the [[Fueros|Old Laws]] and the symbolism of the [[resurrection of Christ]].&lt;ref name=Kasp/&gt; Ideologically, it follows the examples of the older Catalan and Galician patriotic holidays, the [[National Day of Catalonia]] (from 1889 onwards) and the [[Día Nacional de Galicia|National Day of Galicia]] (from 1919 onwards). It was then celebrated in [[San Sebastián]] in 1933, in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] in 1934 and in [[Pamplona]] in 1935. 

From 1936 onwards, the year of the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], it was no longer celebrated in a single location but instead in various localities on a smaller scale and under clandestine conditions as under [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], Aberri Eguna was forbidden from 1937 to 1975. It was only freely celebrated in the [[Northern Basque Country]] under the auspices of the Basque Government in Exile.

==Current status==
The Aberri Eguna is not an official holiday and main events continue to be organized by Basque nationalist parties. However, the exact format and tone depends on the organiser and thus can vary considerably from a political rally to a cultural picnic. In particular in emigrant communities, the celebration of [[Basque culture]] features much more strongly than any political overtones. The cultural element often features events such as [[Basque music]], [[Basque rural sports|traditional sports]], [[Basque cuisine|food]] and drink, in particular [[Sagardotegi|Basque cider]].

{{nihongo|'''Atlus Co., Ltd.'''|株式会社アトラス|Kabushiki gaisha Atorasu}} is a Japanese [[video game]] [[video game developer|developer]], [[video game publisher|publisher]] and distribution company based in [[Tokyo]], and a subsidiary of [[Sega]]. It is best known for developing the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'', ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'', ''[[Etrian Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Trauma Center (video game series)|Trauma Center]]'' series. Its corporate [[mascot]] is Jack Frost, a snowman-like enemy from their ''Shin Megami Tensei'' series.

Atlus was established in April 1986, and existed until the company was dissolved in October 2010 by [[iXIT Corporation|Index Holdings]]. After the dissolution, the name Atlus continued as a brand used by Index Corporation for video game publishing until 2013. Atlus in its current incarnation was founded as Sega Dream Corporation in September 2013, a new [[shell corporation]] established by Sega. In November 2013, Sega Dream was renamed Index Corporation, following the bankruptcy of the original Index Corporation. In April 2014, Sega implemented a [[corporate spin-off]] in which the contents and solution businesses of Index were spun off as Index Corporation, while the rest of Index Corporation (formerly Sega Dream) was renamed Atlus.

The company has two internal divisions, P-Studio, responsible for managing the ''Persona'' series, and Studio Zero, which was established in 2016 by many former members of P-Studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=North|first1=Dale|title=Call the Persona team 'P Studio'|url=https://www.destructoid.com/call-the-persona-team-p-studio--242381.phtml|website=Destructoid|accessdate=28 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023063315/http://www.destructoid.com/call-the-persona-team-p-studio--242381.phtml|archivedate=23 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Minotti|first1=Mike|title=Atlus forms new Studio Zero and tasks Persona director on a fantasy role-playing game|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/12/23/atlus-forms-new-studio-zero-and-tasks-persona-director-on-a-fantasy-role-playing-game/|website=Venture Beat|accessdate=28 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102021404/https://venturebeat.com/2016/12/23/atlus-forms-new-studio-zero-and-tasks-persona-director-on-a-fantasy-role-playing-game/|archivedate=2 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A North American branch of the company, [[Atlus USA]] was founded in 1991 in order to focus on publishing and localizing games for North America. Until 2017, Atlus did not have an office for publishing in [[PAL region]]s, resulting in the company partnering with multiple third-party publishers instead, such as [[Ghostlight]], [[NIS America]], [[Square Enix]], and [[Deep Silver]].

==History==
[[File:Atlus logo.png|thumb|The Atlus logo until 2013]]
{{seealso|List of Atlus games}}
Atlus began in April 7, 1986 as a [[video game developer]] of computer games for other companies.&lt;ref name=history&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20031209003138/http://www.atlus.co.jp/about/kaisha_enkaku.html&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1987, Atlus started selling amusement equipment.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; It expanded into the sale of karaoke equipment in March 1989.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Atlus released the first video game under its own name in 1989: ''[[Puzzle Boy]]'' for the [[Game Boy]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Atlus started in the arcade industry in the 1990s by manufacturing its first arcade video game, ''[[BlaZeon]]'', in 1992. In 1995, Atlus launched Print Club Arcades in partnership with [[Sega]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.segasammy.co.jp/english/pr/corp/history/history_sega.html |title=History of SEGA SAMMY Group/SEGA before Business Integration｜SEGA SAMMY Group｜SEGA SAMMY HOLDINGS |publisher=Segasammy.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2016-12-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220131310/https://www.segasammy.co.jp/english/pr/corp/history/history_sega.html |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlus entered the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1997, listing on the [[JASDAQ]]. In its goal to further increase its presence in the amusement industry, Atlus acquired the  manufacturer [[Irem|Apies]] from Yubis Corporation in 1999. In 2000, Atlus formed a joint venture with [[Kadokawa Shoten]] to distribute and sell games. Atlus suffered from deficit financial results in both 1999 and 2000. To address the issue, Atlus established a management reform plan in 2001. In its restructuring efforts, Atlus sold two subsidiaries (one of them being Apies) to their respective employees as part of a [[management buyout]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20050226011922/http://www.atlus.co.jp/ir/press/pdf/2001/press201_0814.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 2001, Atlus acquired [[Career Soft]], and became the sole publisher of the ''[[Growlanser (series)|Growlanser]]'' series: a [[real-time strategy]] [[role-playing game]] from the creators of the ''[[Langrisser]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/099/099497p1.html|title=Atlus Acquires Career Soft|accessdate=2012-03-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819021600/http://ps2.ign.com/articles/099/099497p1.html|archivedate=19 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, after the release of ''[[Growlanser IV]]'', the majority of Career Soft's staff was merged into the main development team of Atlus where they worked on the ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor]]'' games. As a developer brand, Career Soft was eventually dissolved.

On October 2003, Japanese toy company [[Takara]] acquired Atlus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100221042851/http://www.atlus.co.jp/ir/history/index.html 沿革：株式会社アトラス　IR情報・会社情報]&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November 2006 [[Index Holdings]] announced the acquisition of Atlus, effective on 30 October, and purchased 7.7&amp;nbsp;million shares (54.93 percent; 77,000 votes, or 54.96 percent of the voting rights) on 20 November 2006. Atlus became an Index Holdings subsidiary on 29 November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regarding tender offer results and subsidiary companies |url=http://www.index-hd.com/a_admin/english/pdf/00006039.pdf |accessdate=30 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713024725/http://www.index-hd.com/a_admin/english/pdf/00006039.pdf |archivedate=13 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2009, Atlus and [[Sting Entertainment]] announced a publishing partnership making Atlus the only publisher of Sting-developed games in Japan.&lt;ref name="atlus partners"&gt;{{cite web | title=Atlus Partners with Sting | publisher=IGN | url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/960/960810p1.html | accessdate=26 April 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AdeSxz09?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/03/10/atlus-partners-with-sting | archivedate=13 September 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 September 2009, Index Holdings announced the separation of Atlus' amusement facility and related business into a subsidiary, New Entertainment Waves,&lt;ref&gt;[http://toushi.kankei.me/docs/text/S0006WZM 株式会社ＮＥＷＳ 訂正臨時報告書 2010年10月08日 - 投資関係をなんとなくわかった気になる]&lt;/ref&gt; effective on 1 December.

From 2010 to 2013, Atlus, as a company, ceased to exist and its name became a brand of Index Corporation for video games in Japan. However, [[Atlus USA]] remained active and was renamed Index Digital Media, serving as the North American subsidiary for Index Corporation. Much like in Japan, video games continued to be released in that region under the Atlus name during this period. In June 2013, it was reported that Index Corporation filed for civil rehabilitation proceedings, facing bankruptcy with debts of ¥24.5 billion. An Atlus USA spokesperson said that Index Digital Media and the Atlus brand were unaffected by the proceedings.&lt;ref name=polygon&gt;{{cite news|title=Atlus at risk after parent company announces bankruptcy (update) Index|author=Emily Gera|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/27/4469788/atlus-at-risk-after-parent-company-announces-bankruptcy|publisher=Vox Media|date=27 June 2013|accessdate=27 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630144502/http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/27/4469788/atlus-at-risk-after-parent-company-announces-bankruptcy|archivedate=30 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2013, it was reported that [[Sega Sammy Holdings]] won a bid to acquire the bankrupt Index for ¥14 billion.&lt;ref name="bloomberg-atlussega"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sega Said to Win Auction to Buy Bankrupt Japan Gamemaker Index|author=Shigeru Sato &amp; Takahiko Hyuga|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-18/sega-said-to-win-auction-to-buy-bankrupt-japan-gamemaker-index.html|publisher=Bloomberg|date=18 September 2013|accessdate=18 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922052951/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-18/sega-said-to-win-auction-to-buy-bankrupt-japan-gamemaker-index.html|archivedate=22 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Index operations, including the Atlus brand and Index Digital Media (Atlus USA), were transferred to Sega Dream Corporation (a new subsidiary of Sega Corporation) on 1 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.segasammy.co.jp/english/pdf/release/20130918_index_e_final.pdf|title=Notice of Conclusion regarding Business Transfer Agreement of Index Corporation|publisher=Sega Sammy Holdings Inc.|date=18 September 2013|accessdate=18 September 2013|format=PDF|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927043051/http://www.segasammy.co.jp/english/pdf/release/20130918_index_e_final.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; That day, Sega announced that it would change the name of Sega Dream Corporation to Index Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sega.jp/corp/release/2013/1101/|script-title=ja:当社子会社の事業譲受に関するお知らせ|language=Japanese|publisher=Sega Corporation|date=1 November 2013|accessdate=2 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106081214/http://sega.jp/corp/release/2013/1101/ |deadurl=yes |archivedate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 February 2014, Sega announced the separation of Index Corporation's contents and solution businesses into a new subsidiary, Index Corporation, renaming the old Index Corporation and its remaining digital game business division to Atlus effective 1 April 2014. The new Atlus would include the foreign subsidiary, Index Digital Media, which would revert its name back to Atlus USA at the establishment of the new Atlus.&lt;ref name="sega.co.jp"&gt;[http://sega.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/nr140218_1.pdf 連結子会社の分割（新設分割）及び商号変更に関するお知らせ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408111044/http://sega.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/nr140218_1.pdf |date=8 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Sega Sammy Holdings announced a relocation of head office functions of the Sega Sammy Group and its major domestic subsidiaries located in the [[Tokyo metropolitan area]] to [[Shinagawa-ku]] by January 2018. Their stated reasoning was to promote cooperation among companies and creation of more active interaction of personnel, while pursuing efficient group management by consolidating scattered head office functions of the group. Atlus is one of the companies that will relocate in response to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.segasammy.co.jp/english/pdf/release/20170403_honsha_final_e_.pdf|title=Consolidation/Relocation of Head Office Functions of SEGA SAMMY Group|publisher=[[Sega Sammy Holdings]]|date=3 April 2017|accessdate=4 April 2017|format=PDF|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404220020/http://www.segasammy.co.jp/english/pdf/release/20170403_honsha_final_e_.pdf|archivedate=4 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atlus USA==
{{Main|Atlus USA}}
[[File:Atlus USA E3 2017.jpg|thumb|alt=Advertising display at a trade fair|Atlus USA booth at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017]]]]
Atlus U.S.A., Inc. established in 1991 and based in [[Irvine, California]], is the American subsidiary of Atlus and publishes games created by Atlus and other developers. It was formally called Index Digital Media from 2010 to 2014 in response to Atlus being dissolved into Index Corporation.

A number of ''Megami Tensei'' games have not been released in North America. During the 1990s, ''[[Jack Bros.]]'' for [[Virtual Boy]], ''[[Revelations: Persona]]'' for PlayStation and ''[[Revelations: The Demon Slayer]]'' for the [[Game Boy Color]] were the first three games in the series to have a North American release. The 2004 release of ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne]]'' was the first main-series video-game release in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Kalatasmt"&gt;{{cite web | title=Megami Tensei/Shin Megami Tensei| publisher=Hardcoregaming101.net | url=http://hardcoregaming101.net/megaten/megaten.htm | accessdate=26 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100511065620/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/megaten/megaten.htm| archivedate= 11 May 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then most of the series has also been released in the U.S., including ''[[Persona 3]]'', ''[[Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army]]'' and ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey]]''.

Atlus USA has localized [[cult classic]] ''[[Disgaea: Hour of Darkness]]'', created by [[Nippon Ichi Software]].&lt;ref name="Kalatamarl" /&gt; The company have also published the [[tactical role-playing game]] ''[[Tactics Ogre]]'' and Game Boy Advance remakes of the ''[[Kunio-kun (series)|Kunio-kun]]'' and ''[[Double Dragon (series)|Double Dragon]]'' games for Million (a company composed of former [[Technōs Japan]] employees). Other notable titles include ''[[Snowboard Kids]]'' and ''[[Snowboard Kids 2]]'' (for [[Nintendo 64]]) and ''[[Odin Sphere]]'' and the ''[[Trauma Center (video game series)|Trauma Center]]'' series. Atlus USA released ''[[Riviera: The Promised Land]]'', a role-playing video game for the [[Game Boy Advance]] previously released for the [[Wonderswan Color]], in 2004 in collaboration with [[Sting Entertainment|Sting]] and [[Bandai]]. In 2006 Atlus USA and Sting released ''[[Yggdra Union]]'', a strategy role-playing game (RPG) for the [[Game Boy Advance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | title=RPGFan News – E3 2006 | url=http://rpgfan.com/news/2006/1237.html | accessdate=10 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070918012144/http://rpgfan.com/news/2006/1237.html| archivedate= 18 September 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Working Designs' publication of ''[[Growlanser Generations]]'', they released ''[[Growlanser: Heritage of War]]'' in 2005 and ''[[Growlanser Wayfarer of Time]]'' in 2012.

The company established an online division, including the Atlus Online portal which is servicing ''[[Neo Steam: The Shattered Continent]]'' and ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Imagine]]''.&lt;ref name="kotaku" /&gt; On 31 March 2013, Index Digital Media's Atlus Online Division was purchased by [[Marvelous AQL]] and transferred to [[XSEED Games]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdf.irpocket.com/C7844/qnwX/aBi7/kalD.pdf 当社子会社によるIndex Digital Media, Inc.（米国）のオンラインゲーム事業取得に関するお知らせ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105072247/http://pdf.irpocket.com/C7844/qnwX/aBi7/kalD.pdf |date=5 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlus USA has published games under the ''[[Marl Kingdom]]'' name, beginning with ''[[Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure]]'' in 2000.&lt;ref name="Kalatamarl"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nippon Ichi| publisher=Hardcoregaming101.net | url=http://hardcoregaming101.net/nipponichi/nipponichi.htm | accessdate=26 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100602140200/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/nipponichi/nipponichi.htm| archivedate= 2 June 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European and Oceania distribution==
Until 2017, Atlus did not have a dedicated European division for publishing and distributing their titles within the European and [[Oceania]] region. Instead, many of Atlus' titles were published in these regions by [[Nippon Ichi Software]] (NIS) and its American division NIS America. Following Atlus's acquisition by Sega Sammy Holdings, NIS found that it became more difficult to work between Sega and Atlus for distribution and in April 2016, formally ended its distribution partnership with Atlus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/nis-will-no-longer-publish-atlus-games-in-europe-oceania-357538.phtml | title = NIS will no longer publish Atlus games in Europe, Oceania | first = Kyle | last = MacGregor | date = 25 April 2016 | accessdate = 6 July 2016 | work = [[Destructoid]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160701171417/https://www.destructoid.com/nis-will-no-longer-publish-atlus-games-in-europe-oceania-357538.phtml | archivedate = 1 July 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, [[Deep Silver]] announced that it had come to agreement to become Atlus' distributor for Europe and Oceania, and would begin to publish titles in both retail and digital form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/deep-silver-enters-publishing-agreement-with-atlus-in-europe-373434.phtml | title = Deep Silver enters publishing agreement with Atlus in Europe | first = Chris | last = Carter | date = 6 July 2016 | accessdate = 6 July 2016 | work = [[Destructoid]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160706125741/https://www.destructoid.com/deep-silver-enters-publishing-agreement-with-atlus-in-europe-373434.phtml | archivedate = 6 July 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, Atlus announced that they had opened a European distribution team located in Sega Europe's offices in London that would publish all its titles going forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlus establishes European publishing division|url=http://gematsu.com/2017/08/atlus-establishes-european-publishing-division|website=Gematsu|accessdate=August 24, 2017|date=August 24, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824133939/http://gematsu.com/2017/08/atlus-establishes-european-publishing-division|archivedate=24 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Barnstorming''''' is an [[Atari 2600]] [[video game]] designed by [[Steve Cartwright]] and published by [[Activision]] in [[1982 in video gaming|1982]].&lt;ref name=giantlist/&gt; It was the first game designed by Cartwright.  The idea for ''Barnstorming'' came to him as he watched a biplane one day while driving home from work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&amp;id=222 Classic Gaming] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004135500/http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&amp;id=222 |date=October 4, 2008 }} at GameSpy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The player must pilot a [[biplane]] through a series of [[barn]]s in the shortest time possible while dodging [[windmill]]s, [[weather vane]]s, and [[goose|geese]]. Bumping into anything slows down the plane for a couple of seconds, increasing the overall time.

There are four levels of play determined by the game select switch. Game 1 is ''Hedge Hopper'' (10 barns), game 2 is ''Crop Duster'' (15 barns), game 3 is ''Stunt Pilot'' (15 barns), and game 4 is ''Flying Ace'' (25 barns). In the first three games, the course layout of barns, windmills, and even geese do not change, making it easy to memorize the layout. Game 4 is the only game with a random course.

Originally, a player with a time or better of 33.3 seconds on game 1, 51.0 seconds on game 2, or 54.0 seconds on game 3 could send Activision a picture of their screen and receive membership in the Activision Flying Aces and receive a Flying Aces patch.

==Reception==
Richard A. Edwards reviewed ''Barnstorming'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 54.&lt;ref name="SG"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards |first=Richard A. |date=August 1982 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=54|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards commented that "This is a game no Atari VCS owner should be without.  Buy it."&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt;

'''''Beauty Shop''''' is a 2005 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Bille Woodruff]]. The film serves as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the ''[[Barbershop (film)|Barbershop]]'' film franchise, and stars [[Queen Latifah]] as Gina, a character first introduced in the 2004 film ''[[Barbershop 2: Back in Business]]''. This film also stars [[Alicia Silverstone]], [[Andie MacDowell]], [[Mena Suvari]], [[Kevin Bacon]] and [[Djimon Hounsou]].

==Plot==
Gina Norris ([[Queen Latifah]]) is a [[widow]]ed hairstylist who has moved from [[Chicago]] to [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] so her daughter Vanessa ([[Paige Hurd]]) can attend a private music school. She's made a name for herself as a stylist, but after her self-centered boss, Jorge ([[Kevin Bacon]]), criticizes her decisions, she leaves and sets up her own shop, purchasing a run-down salon by the skin of her teeth by helping out a loan officer.

Upon buying the salon, she runs into instant barriers: loudmouthed young stylists, older clients who are fixed in their habits, an energetic young boy named Willie ([[Lil' JJ]]) who constantly flirts with women (including Vanessa) while filming for his next music video, people wary of her ability as a hairdresser, and the constant trouble her rebellious sister-in-law, Darnelle ([[Keshia Knight Pulliam]]), finds herself in. Gina issues an ultimatum with Darnelle to clean up her act and start paying her back or she will be evicted. In a short time, the previous owner's clients become her own and many of her former customers find their way from Jorge's to her salon. When electrical issues arise, she finds that the upstairs renter, Joe, is a handsome electrician from [[Africa]] who eventually bonds with Vanessa due to his skills on the piano. Because Jorge is jealous that his shop is losing clients to Gina's, he pays a health inspector named Crawford ([[Jim Holmes]]), to find various ways to shut down Gina's business.

Over time, neighborhood regulars frequent the shop and the varied stylists become close to Gina, as does Joe ([[Djimon Hounsou]]). One of her former clients from Jorge's even uses her connections to set up a meeting with Cover Girl for Gina's homemade miracle conditioner, affectionately called "hair crack".

Tragedy strikes when the shop is trashed and heavily vandalized the night before Vanessa's big piano recital. When Gina next enters the shop, she finds not only that her staff has cleaned up the majority of the mess and brought items from home so the shop could operate, but Darnelle has also decided to grow up and enter [[beauty school]]. While filming for his next topic, Willie tapes a meeting between Jorge and Inspector Crawford and learns that they were responsible for trying to ruin Gina. Shortly, a disheveled woman enters the shop and begs for someone to fix her hair for a wedding she has in a few hours. Soon after, Willie shows Gina the videotape of a meeting he filmed of Jorge and Inspector Crawford. Later that night, Gina goes to Jorge's salon to not only tell him about the tape, but that she knows he is not Jorge from Austria, but George Christie from Nebraska. As soon as Gina leaves, James ([[Bryce Wilson]]) (Gina's only male employee) and a few of his friends give Jorge an extreme haircut as payback for what he did to her in trying to close her shop.

Later, as the shop listens to their favorite radio talk-show host DJ Hollerin' Helen ([[Adele Givens]]), they find out she was the desperate customer on the way to the wedding as she gives the shop (and Gina's "hair crack" conditioner) a shout-out on the radio.

==Reception==
Reviews for the film were mixed; it earned a 37% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from critics, with the consensus being that the film itself was not the equal of [[Queen Latifah]]'s strong performance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1139289-beauty_shop/, Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Metacritic]], the film has averaged a 53 rating from 28 critics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/beautyshop?q=Beauty%20Shop, Metacritic&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allmovie]] gave the film 3/5 stars, with reviewer Derek Armstrong saying that while the film sticks to the same formula which made the ''[[Barbershop (film)|Barbershop]]'' films so successful, it still "bursts with life, having attracted a spectrum of enthusiastic performers and a script that exceeds broad character types."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:302684~T1, Allmovie Review&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bits''''' is a British [[entertainment]] television series that aired on [[Channel 4]] from 4 June 1999 to 6 April 2001, with both late night and edited morning versions of the show. 

Five series were produced and uniquely at the time for a show about computer games, had an all female presentation team. 

There were also a number of special episodes, notably a three-parter in early 2000 titled the Bits 'Super Console Tour' which primarily featured the girls challenging various "pro" gamers in 1v1 battles around the UK in each episode (London, Blackpool, and one other location), as well as their usual sketches and short reviews/newsclips. The games chosen were usually new releases on various consoles, one of which was [[FantaVision]] on the newly launched PlayStation 2, at which Emily Booth was defeated by Alek Hayes, who was employed at the time at [[BarrysWorld]].

The organization is not a [[pressure group]] or [[watchdog journalism|watchdog]] on advertising. It does not attempt to enforce rules or represent that a single "LGBT point of view" exists, given the great [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] of the LGBT population. It does not seek to embarrass advertisers, organize protests against them or their advertising, or force them to do anything except expand their understanding and awareness of LGBT sensitivity in all advertising using business rationales.

The organization believes that by reaching the image makers themselves, future advertising will be more inclusive and positive through this education.

Commercial Closet Association educates the business and advertising world through advertising training, an online Ad Library, Best Practices guidelines, a monthly LGBT advertising issues column, and the annual IMAGES IN ADVERTISING AWARDS event to honor excellence of LGBT portrayals in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==About CCA's History==

The organization developed out of work by [[Advertising Age]] magazine business journalist [http://www.mikewilke.com Michael Wilke], who was invited in 1996 by the New York City Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival to present a worldwide history of LGBT representations in commercials. Wilke was already known for his work in writing about gay and lesbian matters in advertising. Wilke's video program, called "The Commercial Closet" appeared in 1997, then was widely presented at film festivals internationally, and in 2001 Wilke was funded by broadcast historian Michael Collins, then of Quinnipiac College of Connecticut,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5771">'''Constance, Lady Crabtree''' is a comedy character created by the author and broadcaster Paul James in July 1978. Intended only as a single cabaret performance, Lady Crabtree proved to be so popular with audiences in the UK that he has now been performing her on stage, radio and television for almost forty years. The first radio broadcast was as a celebrity panellist on a [[BBC Radio 2]] quiz show ''Funny Peculiar'' (1982) with [[Gyles Brandreth]], [[Sandra Dickinson]], [[Barry Cryer]], [[Clement Freud]], [[Roger Cook (journalist)|Roger Cook]], [[Magnus Pyke]] and [[June Whitfield]]. Early television appearances included BBC 1's ''[[Pebble Mill at One]]'' and ''[[Daytime Live]]'' (1988) and ITV's ''The James Whale Show'' (1990); Lady Crabtree has broadcast on radio and television worldwide, most recently in February 2008 when she was one of [[Dame Margot Hamilton]]'s guests on [[BBC Three]]'s ''Upstaged'' series and in 2013 when interviewed on the ''Scott Spears Now'' show for American television following the birth of [[Prince George of Cambridge]]. 2018 will mark Lady Crabtree's 40th anniversary in public life.

Lady Crabtree is the author of two books:''The Secret Journals of Queen Elizabeth II'' (Columbus 1988 and Virgin Books 1990) and ''The Secret Royal Love Letters'' (Virgin Books 1990).

== Character history ==
Born Constance May Rose Battersby in Warrior Square Gardens, [[St Leonards-on-Sea]], East Sussex, on 1 May 1948; her twin sister Millicent was delivered shortly afterwards. This was not only a shock to their mother - who had not realised that she was pregnant - but even more of a surprise to people strolling through the Square. With parents in the theatre,(performing as the variety act ''The Gay Goslings'') the girls travelled widely throughout their childhood, and attended various schools for short periods. Constance completed her education at ''Madame Bernice's Academy of Refinement and Beauty'' in Gripe Street, London. 

She met her husband-to-be, the Hon Claude Crabtree, in the Assembly Rooms, York, during her twenty-first birthday ball. After a whirlwind romance, they were married on 1 July 1969 in the gloomy village church of King Herod the Great on the Crabtree family estate at Cleghorn St Percy, North Yorkshire. The couple later had twin sons,Giles&lt;ref&gt;Disinherited 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and Miles.&lt;ref&gt;The present Lord Crabtree 1984-&lt;/ref&gt; When Claude's father (Montfort, 8th [[Baron]] Crabtree) died on 7 June 1977, at the age of 104, Claude inherited the [[Baron]]y and Constance became Lady Crabtree. If he had died just a day earlier, Lady Crabtree would not have been deprived of a seat at the Queen's Silver Jubilee Service in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and she harbours a suspicion that he lingered deliberately just to spite her.

As a full-fledged member of the aristocracy, in 1978 her public life began in earnest, particularly in connection with Lord Crabtree's role as Chairman of the Mid-Yorkshire Swine Breeders' Federation - the Crabtrees owning some of the largest sites in Yorkshire. A highlight of her early married life was entertaining [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and the [[Duke of Edinburgh]] at a Swine Breeders' dinner at Crabtree Hall, which greatly improved Lady C's standing as a society hostess. Continuing her family's interest in the theatre (''she had herself appeared as a chorus girl in her teenage years at the Theatre Royal in York'') Lady Crabtree became Patron of the Cleghorn Local Amateur Players (''The CLAP''), a role she still endures to this day.

After Claude's death in 1984 (''Face down in the bombe-surprise at a dinner party.'') and left with astronomical death duties plus her husband's gambling debts, the Dowager Lady Crabtree found herself financially embarrassed. Taking pity on her situation, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] offered her the post of Relief-Woman of the Bedchamber within the Royal Household. After publishing extracts from the Queen's diaries and letters in the misguided belief that she was doing Her Majesty a favour, Lady Crabtree unexpectedly found that her services were no longer required. In 2005 she became a Reserve-Lady in Waiting to [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]].

Now residing in [[Eastbourne]], where she divides her time between a sea front hotel and a Home for Gentlewomen Living in Reduced Circumstances, Lady Crabtree continues to fulfil an active public life, presenting prizes, speaking at lunches and dinners, making personal appearances, and enjoys acting as compere at numerous functions, frequently regaling audiences with memories of her life with the Royal Family. She speaks at many events each year, is the doyen of Ladies' Lunch Clubs. With humour ideally suited to the over-fifties, current talks include "How To Grown Old Disgracefully" and "Glad To Be Grey" In 2018 Lady Crabtree will celebrate 40 years in public life.

== Official style ==
Lady Crabtree is formally known as "Constance, Lady Crabtree", and in widowhood can also be referred to as "The Dowager Lady Crabtree". She should not be called "Lady Constance", and would only be addressed in this form had she been born the daughter of an Earl, a Marquess or a Duke.

[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - Stephen Colbert in Iraq (2).jpg|thumb|Stephen Colbert interviewing a member of the U.S. army]]
''[[The Colbert Report]]'', which premiered in American cable television on October 17, 2005, has had a massive cultural impact since its inception, when the show introduced the word "[[truthiness]]". Issues in and references to American and world culture are attributed to the character played by [[Stephen Colbert]], who calls his followers the Colbert Nation. ''The Colbert Report'' is a [[late night television|late-night]] [[Late-night talk show|talk]] and [[news satire]] [[television program]] hosted by [[Stephen Colbert]] that aired on [[Comedy Central]] from October 17, 2005 to December 18, 2014 for 1,447 episodes. The show focused on a [[Stephen Colbert (character)|fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert]], played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a "well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status [[Idiot (usage)|idiot]]", is a caricature of televised political [[pundit]]s. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly [[Fox News]]' ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''. ''The Colbert Report'' is a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of Comedy Central's ''[[The Daily Show]]'', where he acted as a [[correspondent]] for the program for several years while developing the character.

The program was created by Colbert, [[Jon Stewart]], and [[Ben Karlin]]. The show's writing was grounded in [[improvisation]], and often lampooned [[current events]] stories. The show's structure also included a guest interview, in which the Colbert character attempts to deconstruct his opponent's argument. The show was taped in [[New York City]]'s [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood, and the program's set is "hyper-American," epitomizing the character's ego. The show was taped and broadcast Monday through Thursday, with weeks taken off at multiple points in a given year for breaks. ''The Colbert Report'' saw immediate critical and ratings successes, leading to various awards, including two prestigious [[Peabody Award]]s. The show's cultural influence—which occasionally would require a fair degree of participation from the show’s audience, dubbed the "Colbert Nation"—extended beyond the program a number of times. This impact included the character running for [[U.S. President]] twice, co-hosting a [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear|rally]] at the [[National Mall]], presenting a [[Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner|controversial performance]] at the [[White House Correspondents' Association|White House Correspondents' Dinner]], and establishing a real [[Colbert Super PAC|Super PAC]] that raised a million dollars. In addition, the show inspired various forms of multimedia, including music and multiple best-selling books.

In May 2006, the [[Tom DeLay]] Legal Defense Trust posted a video of ''The Colbert Report'' on its website and sent out a mass email urging DeLay supporters to watch how "Hollywood liberal" [[Robert Greenwald]] "crashed and burned . . . when promoting his new attack on Tom DeLay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/delay.JPG|title=Defend DeLay|publisher=Think Progress|date=May 2006|accessdate=September 2, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904202222/http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/delay.JPG|archivedate=September 4, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video featured Colbert asking questions such as, "Who hates America more, you or [[Michael Moore]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/2006/05/24/delay-colbert/|title=Desperate for Supporters, DeLay Turns to Stephen Colbert|publisher=Think Progress|date=May 24, 2006|accessdate=September 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust's email describes its content as "the truth behind Liberal Hollywood's" [[The Big Buy: Tom DeLay's Stolen Congress|film about DeLay]], and characterizes the ''Colbert Report'' clip with the headline, "Colbert Cracks the Story on Real Motivations Behind the Movie." On June 8, 2006, Colbert responded by conducting an "Exclusive Fake Interview" on his show with DeLay. Three different interviews with DeLay on different networks were spliced for humorous effect, and Colbert ended the "interview" by saying "I do hope you enjoyed my manipulation of your words." DeLay has since appeared as a guest on the program.

Colbertnation.com (July 25, 2006). Retrieved June 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert responded to television networks—specifically [[Fox News]], NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' and ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]''—which took comments made by Florida Congressman [[Robert Wexler]] on ''The Colbert Report'' out of context (e.g.: "I enjoy cocaine and the company of prostitutes because they are a fun thing to do."). Wexler, who ran unopposed in the then-upcoming election, made the comments in response to urging by Colbert that he "say some things that would really lose the election for [Wexler] if [Wexler] were contested."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |title=Rep.

Colbert subsequently told his viewers to "vote Wexler, the man's got a sense of humor, unlike, evidently, journalists."

==Animals named for Stephen Colbert==
Colbert announced on his March 28, 2006 show that he had been contacted by [[San Francisco Zoo]] officials seeking his permission to name an unhatched [[bald eagle]] after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/31/DDGU9GJ5T21.DTL |title=Leah Garchik |last=Garchik |first=Leah |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=March 31, 2006 |accessdate=September 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eagle, affectionately dubbed Stephen Jr. on ''The Report'', was bred to be reintroduced into the wild, as a part of the zoo's California Bald Eagle Breeding Program. Colbert celebrated the chick's birth on the April 17, 2006, program, and has since given updates on the bird's development. He has criticized the bird for migrating to Canada, and has attempted to lure him back to the U.S. On December 24, 2008, Stephen Jr. (tag A-46) was photographed at the Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge on the California/Oregon border.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008568404_colberteagle29m.html A Colbert report: Bald eagle Stephen Jr. sighted in Oregon | Seattle Times Newspaper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112092040/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008568404_colberteagle29m.html |date=2012-01-12 }}.

On June 24, 2008, [[Jason Bond|Dr. Jason Bond]], an associate professor with the Department of [[Biology]] at [[East Carolina University]], appeared on the show because he agreed to name a [[spider]] after Stephen Colbert. They negotiated over what kind of spider would be named after Stephen, and Colbert told the professor that they would "settle this in the next couple of weeks". During the interview, the visual approximation of Bond changed between different pictures depicting [[Spider-Man]], including [[Tobey Maguire]] (the actor who played Spider-Man in the films) and costumed people/animals. The spider was officially announced on August 6 as the ''[[Aptostichus stephencolberti]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25956273/|title=Trapdoor spider becomes Colbert's namesake|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=August 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neologisms==
''The Colbert Report'' has created new words. Besides "[[truthiness]]", Colbert has coined other terms including "freem", which is "freedom without the do, because I do it all for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Possible origin of Freem? | date=2007-01-10 | url =http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=724|publisher=No Fact Zone | accessdate =2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other words include: "eneagled", a [[blend word|blend]] of "enabled" and "eagle", thus meaning "to be given the characteristics of an eagle" and "mantasy", meaning male fantasies, such as running away from the wife to become free, a word to which Colbert claims to hold a trademark. In 2009, he coined the word "engayify" meaning "to gay it up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Colbert Report: Toby Keith | work = TV.com | date=2007-06-20| url =http://www.tv.com/the-colbert-report/toby-keith/episode/1075931/summary.html | accessdate =2008-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wikipedia references==
Colbert made repeated references on the show to [[Wikipedia]], which he referred to as his favorite website, generally in "[[The Wørd]]" segment. Colbert's first reference to Wikipedia was during the July 31, 2006 broadcast, when "The Word" was [[Wikiality]], defined as the concept that "[[Truth by consensus|together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the reality we just agreed on]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=72347 | title=Video: The Colbert Report, Wikiality | date=2006-07-31 | authorlink=Stephen Colbert | first=Stephen|last=Colbert| accessdate=2007-05-25 | publisher=[[Comedy Central]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080308053730/http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=72347 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise of wikiality is that reality is what the wiki says it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sanger, Larry|title=Who says we know: On the new politics of knowledge|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/sanger07/sanger07_index.html|work=Edge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that on Wikipedia "any user can change any entry, and if enough users agree with them, it becomes true". He also told his viewers to edit the Wikipedia article on [[elephant]]s to edit say: "Elephant population in Africa has tripled over the past six months." The suggestion resulted in numerous changes to Wikipedia articles related to elephants and Africa. Editing of the articles concerned was restricted to prevent further edits. The pages' protection expiration date has been postponed several times as the vandalism ensued again.

Another Colbert neologism related to Wikipedia is "Wikilobbying", regarding which he stated "when money determines Wikipedia entries, reality has become a commodity". He alluded to a case involving controversy over whether governments should reject a [[Microsoft]] document format in favor of an independent standard, during which Microsoft allegedly hired a Linux user to edit Wikipedia to ensure neutral and factual coverage of Microsoft's version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/01/an_interesting_offer.html | title=An interesting offer: get paid to contribute to Wikipedia | date=2007-01-22 | first=Rick |last=Jeliffe | accessdate=2008-09-02 | work=O'Reilly XML Blog|publisher=oreillynet.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert used the term "[[self-determination]]" to refer to corporations being able to act out their fantasies online by editing their own Wikipedia entries. Colbert described Wikipedia as "''[[Second Life]]'' for corporations", saying that if a corporation wants to pretend to be someone else online, then that is their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/183247/august-21-2007/the-word---self-determination|title="The Word" - Self-Determination|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=2007-08-21|accessdate=2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another episode, guest Dan Zaccagnino was discussing his [[Indaba Music|new wiki]] where readers could share their musical compositions. In an imitation of [[record scratching]], Colbert used the term "Wiki-Wiki-Wikipedia".

On May 24, 2007, the guest was [[Jimmy Wales]], the co-founder of Wikipedia. Stephen Colbert called Wikipedia a "battlefield for information", a tool which "brings democracy to information" and moves away from the views of the "elite who study things and get to say what is or is not real". During the interview, Colbert showed a sentence on the screen, "Librarians are hiding something."  Wales was not allowed to see it, implying that he could not personally stop a critical mass of individuals from editing a page when he did not know which page was the target. Wales responded that "the interesting thing about ''The Colbert Report'' is that [[Wikipedia community|Wikipedians]] watch it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=87528|title=Jimmy Wales|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=2007-05-24|accessdate=2008-09-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080510170626/http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=87528 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, 2008, Colbert mentioned [[Warren G. Harding]] as being a "secret negro president", and said that for proof, "the G stands for Gangsta" which he edited Wikipedia to state so that he could cite a source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=The Colbert Report |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/172954/june-09-2008/threatdown---secret-negro-presidents |title=ThreatDown – Secret Negro Presidents |date=2008-06-09 |first=Stephen |last=Colbert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, Hungarian news sites reported Colbert had won the first round of voting with 17,231,724 votes,&lt;ref name=First_round&gt;{{cite web| url = http://index.hu/gazdasag/magyar/colb060822/ | title = A seggfej Zrínyi előtt amerikai humorista nyerte a hídnévversenyt | accessdate = 2008-09-02 | date = 2006-08-22 | work = Index.hu | language = Hungarian }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is 7 million more people than there are in all of Hungary.  Hungary changed the voting rules after the members of the Colbert Nation Forums developed a [[Internet bot|bot]] to stuff the ballot box, requiring registration to vote in the second phase. That night, Colbert asked his viewers to cease their efforts,&lt;ref name=apologies&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=73378 | title=Colbert Report: Hungarian Bridge | authorlink=Stephen Colbert|first=Stephen|last=Colbert|accessdate=2006-08-28|publisher=[[Comedy Central]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080602154754/http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=73378 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offered apologies,&lt;ref name=apologies/&gt; spending a segment honoring Hungary, its history, and its contributions to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=73377 | title=Colbert Report: Stephen Colbert Salutes Hungary | authorlink=Stephen Colbert | first=Stephen|last=Colbert| accessdate=2006-08-28 | publisher=[[Comedy Central]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080420174019/http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=73377 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 14, 2006, Colbert introduced his guest [[András Simonyi]], Ambassador of the [[Hungary|Republic of Hungary]] to the United States. The [[ambassador]] presented Mr. Colbert with a declaration certifying him as the winner of the second and final round of voting. The document bore the signatures of [[Politics of Hungary|Hungarian government]] officials and the [[coat of arms of Hungary|country's official seal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher =[[Embassy]] of [[Hungary]] | title =Hungarian Ambassador in the Colbert Report | date= 2006-10-15 | url =http://www.huembwas.org/Hirek/Colbert20060915.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Included in the text, as read by the ambassador, were two important conditions required for the name of the bridge to be made official. First, Colbert must be [[fluency|fluent]] in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. Colbert responded by pronouncing the Hungarian name ''Nicholas Zrinyi'' (incorrectly referring to [[Miklós Zrínyi]]) and ''híd'' (meaning 'bridge' in Hungarian); Simonyi quickly certified him as fluent.&lt;ref name="thill"/&gt; The second requirement proved more onerous: To have the bridge named after him, Colbert would have to be deceased. Colbert protested, but the ambassador presented him with a [[Hungarian passport]] and [[:Image:HUF 10000 1997 obverse.jpg|10,000 Hungarian Forint]] ([[Hungarian Forint|HUF]]), noting that this would allow Colbert to enter Hungary at any time, without restriction. He also brought attention to the [[portrait]] of King [[Stephen I of Hungary|St. Stephen]], the first King of Hungary, on the 10,000 HUF bill. Finally Simonyi implied that the question of Colbert's ineligibility by virtue of being alive might be resolved if Colbert were to accept an invitation to visit the [[Northern M0 Danube bridge|bridge site]] in [[Budapest]]; Colbert responded by trying to bribe the ambassador with the 10,000 HUF bill.&lt;ref name="thill"&gt;{{cite news | last =Thill | first =Scott | title =Bridge to Somewhere | date= 2006-10-15 | url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-thill/bridge-to-somewhere_b_29493.html | accessdate =2008-09-02 | work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 28, 2006, it was announced that the bridge will be named "Megyeri Bridge", although the name did not make it to the second round. According to the Geographical Name Committee, the name was selected because the bridge connects [[:hu:Káposztásmegyer|Káposztásmegyer]] with [[Békásmegyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.online.rtlklub.hu/hirek/hazank/?id=0609231745 |title=The M0 Bridge named as Megyeri Bridge |publisher=RTLKlub.hu |date=2006-09-28 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remix competitions==
Colbert sometimes implicitly suggests that his fans remix various aspects of his show simply by telling them not to remix it.  In January 2009, he told viewers not to remix his interview with [[Lawrence Lessig]], founder of [[Creative Commons]], which lets authors of creative works share them with the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/216595/january-21-2009/stephen-s-remix-challenge |title=Stephen's Remix Challenge - The Colbert Report - 1/21/09 - Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Colbertnation.com |date=January 21, 2009 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of fan involvement is similar to the Colbert Green Screen Challenge, which focuses on video content editing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colbert report#Green Screen Challenge]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Running for President in 2008==
{{Main article|Stephen Colbert presidential campaign, 2008}}

On October 16, 2007, Colbert announced on ''The Report'' that he would be running for president. He had chosen no [[vice-president]], though he was considering choosing [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Mike Huckabee]], or himself as his running mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003659135|title =Stephen Colbert Officially Announces Run for White House!|accessdate=2007-10-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017193759/http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003659135|archivedate=October 17, 2007|date=October 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert declared that he was only running in [[South Carolina]], his home state, and was contemplating running for both the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] parties as a "[[favorite son]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=118597|title=Colbert '08|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=2007-10-16|accessdate=2008-09-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080731231524/http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=118597 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Coyle|first=Jake|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hFzxF7XLwi7Il2DVEE6la0NVo--gD8SAOEEG1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110004541/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hFzxF7XLwi7Il2DVEE6la0NVo--gD8SAOEEG1|archivedate=2007-11-10|title=Stephen Colbert to Run for President|agency=Associated Press|date=2007-10-17|accessdate=2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert covered his story in the segment "The Hail to the Cheese Stephen Colbert NachoCheese [[Doritos]] 2008 Presidential Campaign Coverage" and promoted his campaign on his special election website colbert08.org, as under law he cannot use colbertnation.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=118650|title=Hail to the Cheese|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=2007-10-18|accessdate=2008-09-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080510121238/http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=118650 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2007, Colbert was interviewed by host [[Tim Russert]] on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet The Press]]''. Colbert explained why he changed the pronunciation of his name (from "COLE-Bert" to "Cole-BEAR"), demanded to know whether Russert believes that God supports our enemies in Iraq and revealed that he had no interest in ''winning'' the Presidency (he just wanted to run).

On November 1, 2007, the executive council of the [[South Carolina Democratic Party]] voted 13-3 to keep his name off the ballot and refunded his US$2500 filing fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1107/6674.html|title=S.C.

==Canton insults and apologies==
On the July 21, 2008, episode of ''The Colbert Report'', Colbert made a comment about John McCain making a campaign stop in [[Canton, Ohio]], and "not the crappy [[Canton, Georgia|Canton in Georgia]]."&lt;ref name="ajc"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |title=Colbert's 'crappy Canton' comment puzzles mayor |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/cherokee/stories/2008/07/23/colbert_canton_comment.html |date=2008-07-23 |first=Jamie |last=Gumbrecht |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208192542/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/cherokee/stories/2008/07/23/colbert_canton_comment.html |archivedate=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The comment resulted in a local uproar, with the Canton, Georgia mayor insisting Colbert had never visited the town along with an invitation for him to do so.&lt;ref name="ajc"/&gt;

On July 30, 2008, Colbert apologized for the story, insisting that he was incorrect and that the real crappy Canton was [[Canton, Kansas]], after which he made several jokes at the Kansas town's expense including calling the town a "shit hole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=WXIA-TV |title=Colbert Apologizes To Canton...

On August 5, 2008, Colbert apologized to the citizens of Canton, Kansas, he then maintained that he had meant to direct his mock derision towards [[Canton, South Dakota]], by calling it "North Dakota's dirty ashtray" and satirizing the town in song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Colbert Report pokes fun at Canton, S.D. |url=http://www.argusleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080806/FRONTPAGECAROUSEL/80806022&amp;referrer=FRONTPAGECAROUSEL |work=Argus Leader |date=2008-08-06}}{{Dead link|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Colbert Report |title=Canton, Kansas Apology |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=178714 |date=2008-08-05 |first=Stephen |last=Colbert |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910235832/http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=178714 |archivedate=September 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12, 2008, Colbert once again apologized to his latest comedic target even though local reaction to the insult was fairly mild. Referring to a line from his satirical song, Colbert said that not all the dogs run away from Canton, South Dakota but "some stay and develop a drinking problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Colbert Report |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=179260 |title=Canton, South Dakota Apology |date=2008-08-12 |first=Stephen |last=Colbert |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823135347/http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=179260 |archivedate=August 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as with the previous apologies, he began a new tirade on another Canton. According to Colbert, [[Canton, Texas]] is nothing but an "incorporated outhouse" and "one steaming pile of longhorn dung." He then asked the audience if they'd seen the town's tourism video. A video then promptly followed showing a monkey humping another monkey with the words Canton, Texas placed in the corner and an arrow pointing from the name to the monkey on bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ktiv.com/Global/story.asp?S=8836138 |publisher=KTIV News Channel 4 |title=Stephen Colbert apologizes to Canton, S.D. |date=2008-08-13}}{{Dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This jab at the Texas town had been predicted by Governor Sebelius at the end of her July 31, 2008, remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kwch.com/Global/story.asp?S=8769074 |work=KWCH Eyewitness News |title=Governor Responds to "Colbert Report" Jokes |date=2008-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823093709/http://www.kwch.com/Global/story.asp?S=8769074 |archivedate=August 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to Colbert's comments, a Canton, Texas city councilman joked that he wanted Colbert to come there so he could "mash his nose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theinsider.com/news/1130348_Texas_town_responds_to_Colbert_s_outhouse_slam |work=YahooNews |title=Texas town responds to Colbert's 'outhouse' slam |date=2008-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713155604/http://www.theinsider.com/news/1130348_Texas_town_responds_to_Colbert_s_outhouse_slam |archivedate=July 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2008, Colbert reacted to the news that Barack Obama was campaigning for president in Canton, Ohio &amp;mdash; the original good Canton &amp;mdash; by saying that he was forced to admit that Canton, Ohio in fact was the ''real'' crappy Canton all along.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=The Colbert Report |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/189689/october-28-2008/canton--ohio|title=Canton, South Dakota Apology |date=2008-10-28 |first=Stephen |last=Colbert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Colbert Bump==
The "Colbert Bump" is defined, connotatively by the ''Report'', as an increase in popularity of a person (author, musician, politician, etc.) or thing (website, etc.) as a result of appearing as a guest on or (in the case of a thing) being mentioned on the show. For example, if a politician appears on ''The Colbert Report'', they may become more popular with certain voters and thus are more likely to be elected. According to a study by [[James H. Fowler]], contributions to Democratic politicians rose 40% for 30 days after an appearance on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/colbert_bump.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Colbert Bump in Campaign Donations: More Truthful than Truthy |journal=PS: Political Science &amp; Politics |issue=3 |volume=41 |pages=533–539 |date=July 2008 |author=[[James H.

===Colbert Bump (alcoholic beverage)===
A [[cocktail]] called the ''Colbert Bump'' was designed during the August 4th, 2009, episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' by author David Wondrich. The recipe for a Colbert Bump includes one ounce of [[Peter Heering|Cherry Heering liqueur]], one and a half ounces of [[gin]], a quarter of an ounce of [[lemon]] juice, and a little [[soda water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/240729/august-04-2009/colbert-bump-cocktail---david-wondrich|publisher=Colbert Nation|title=Colbert Bump Cocktail-David Wondrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NASA's Node 3==
{{Further|Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill}}
In March 2009, [[NASA]] ran an online contest to name the new node of the [[International Space Station]]. Colbert encouraged his viewers to write in his name. By the end, 230,539 "Colbert" votes were cast. This beat ''Serenity'', the top NASA choice, by more than 40,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2009/03/colbert_vs_nasa_congressional.html |title=Colbert vs NASA: Congressional ally |publisher=Swamppolitics.com |date=2012-01-01 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On April 14, 2009, Astronaut "Suni" Sunita Williams appeared on ''The Colbert Report'', and announced the name of the node to be ''Tranquility.'' However, the treadmill the astronauts use to work out on will be named "C.O.L.B.E.R.T." for "Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill" and this will be located in ''Tranquility.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30217550/ |title=NASA names treadmill after Colbert - Technology &amp; science - Space - msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2009-04-14 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 2009, Colbert announced that the show would be broadcasting from somewhere in [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|The Persian Gulf]] at some future date. He did not reveal where and when the taping would occur, as that would have presented a security breach. As part of this he made a segment called "Where in the world and when in time is Stephen Colbert gonna be in the Gulf?" In it he offered vague clues to the location via a ''[[Press Your Luck]]'' board, and described the location being somewhere "sandy" and "packed with troops".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=61410/|publisher=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]|title=Colbert heads downrange, maybe New Mexico|date=2009-03-18|accessdate=2009-05-06}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeatedly alluded to places he might go, but refused to divulge specific details.

Odierno]], Commander of the [[Multinational Force - Iraq]], at the videotaped order given by President [[Barack Obama]] during the first of four taped performances that were aired June 8, 2009 through June 11, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filterless.net/2009/06/07/stephen-colbert-shaves-head-gives-shout-out-from-iraq/ Stephen Colbert Shaves Head, Gives Shout Out From Iraq] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090612061620/http://www.filterless.net/2009/06/07/stephen-colbert-shaves-head-gives-shout-out-from-iraq/ |date=2009-06-12 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wore a civilian [[Suit (clothing)|two-piece suit]], but with a twist: it was tailored from the [[United States Army]]'s [[Universal Camouflage Pattern|UCP digital camouflage pattern]] and featured an [[American flag]] and [[Private (United States)|Private rank insignias]] on the sleeves. Vice President [[Joe Biden]] and Senators [[John McCain]] and [[Jim Webb]] made special appearances, as did former GOP Vice Presidential nominee [[Sarah Palin]] and former Presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[George H.W. Bush]]. Actor [[Tom Hanks]] was also featured heavily in a pre-recorded segment encouraging viewers to support care packages for the troops. At the start of all four episodes filmed in Iraq, Stephen Colbert carried a golf club on stage to honor [[Bob Hope]]'s decades-long service, 250 years according to Colbert, for the USO across the world.

==U.S. Olympic speed skating sponsorship==
On November 2, 2009, Colbert, representing the [[Colbert Nation]], signed a sponsorship agreement on-air with U.S. speedskating executive director Robert Crowley after learning of the loss of the team's prominent sponsor: Dutch bank [[DSB Bank|DSB]]. The specifics of this sponsorship are unclear.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The change of the logo of the U.S. speed skating team's cap, from DSB to Colbert Nation was later shown in the November 12 episode and further episodes. Colbert has also taken aim at [[Canada]], mocking and insulting them, claiming they weren't giving the speed skaters adequate ice time at Olympic rink in [[Vancouver]] in preparation for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]. The city of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], where the Olympic Oval is located, had responded with a letter inviting him to be the official [[ombudsman]] at the oval for the Olympics, under the condition that he wear the official ombudsman headgear (a pink [[tuque]]) at all times.&lt;ref name="hrs1"/&gt;

As a result, Stephen attempted to make the US Olympic team in various sports including speedskating in which the final spot would be his if he were to beat [[Shani Davis]] in a 500m race.  He lost, but became the Assistant Sport [[Psychologist]] to the US Speedskating team (Colbert holds an honorary [[Doctorate]] in Fine Arts).  This perk also ensured that he would be able to be a journalist covering the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] on his own show, and [[NBC]] where he filed speedskating reports during their primetime telecasts with [[Bob Costas]] as host. Conversely, Colbert would also feature NBC hosts and reporters covering the Olympics in his coverage of the games, alongside Olympic athletes, many of whom were from the US Speedskating team.

==Raj Patel's identification as the "Messiah"==
[[Benjamin Creme]], self-proclaimed [[esotericist]], and owner of [[Share International]] magazine, identified the coming "[[Messiah]]/[[Maitreya]] (or future [[Buddha]])" as having been: born in 1972; traveled to London from India in 1977; been dark-skinned, and having a stutter. Shortly after [[Raj Patel]], the author of the recent book, "The Value of Nothing" appeared on the show, Creme stated the Messiah had appeared on a popular television program in the United States. Patel was identified as such messiah by Creme's followers, as he fulfilled all of Creme's previous predictions. In the March 15, 2010 show, Colbert claimed this was product of a  ''Colbert Bump'' and called Patel on the telephone to confirm his status as the deity, which the author denied. However, Benjamin Creme had also predicted that the Messiah would deny his status, reinforcing his followers' belief in Patel's divine status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/16/raj-patel-is-the-messiah_n_500645.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Jessie | last=Kunhardt | title=Raj Patel Is The Messiah, Says Religious Group After Author Appears On 'The Colbert Report' (VIDEO) | date=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/full-episodes/mon-march-15-2010-robert-baer |title=June 06, 2011 - Werner Herzog - The Colbert Report - Full Episode Video &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Colbertnation.com |date=2011-06-06 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Zero==
[[Queen Noor of Jordan]] appeared on ''The Colbert Report'' to promote [[Global Zero (campaign)|Global Zero]], an [[international]], [[non-partisan]], [[initiative]] to achieve phased, binding, and verifiable elimination of [[nuclear weapons]].  Colbert signed the Global Zero declaration during the interview.

==2006 White House Correspondents Association Dinner==
{{main article|Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner}}
Stephen Colbert gave a [[satirical]] speech at the [[2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner]] in which he criticized the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] and the [[news media]].  The performance earned him praise and scorn in the media.

==2010 Congressional testimony for migrant workers==
On September 24, 2010, Colbert testified in character before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Security. He was invited by committee chairwoman [[Zoe Lofgren]] to describe his experience participating in the [[United Farm Workers]]' "Take Our Jobs" program, where he spent a day working alongside [[migrant workers]] in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-09-24/politics/colbert.house.immigration_1_undocumented-farm-workers-migrant-farm-labor-foreign-workers?_s=PM:POLITICS |work=CNN |title=Fresh off farm gig, comedian Colbert testifies in House hearing |date=2010-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114140510/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-09-24/politics/colbert.house.immigration_1_undocumented-farm-workers-migrant-farm-labor-foreign-workers?_s=PM%3APOLITICS |archivedate=2012-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his often-humorous testimony, Colbert broke character in responding to a question from Rep. [[Judy Chu]], D-CA, and explained why he cares about the plight of migrant workers.

“I like talking about people who don't have any power, and this seems like one of the least powerful people in the United States are migrant workers who come and do our work, but don't have any rights as a result. And yet we still invite them to come here and at the same time ask them to leave. And that's an interesting contradiction to me. And, you know, 'Whatsoever you do for the least of my brothers,' and these seem like the least of our brothers right now... Migrant workers suffer and have no rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lippmannwouldroll.com/2010/09/24/stephen-colbert-breaks-character-in-congressional-testimony-to-advocate-for-migrant-workers/ |title=Stephen Colbert Breaks Character in Congressional Testimony to Advocate for Migrant Workers |publisher=Lippmann Would Roll |date=2010-09-24 |accessdate=2012-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019012049/http://lippmannwouldroll.com/2010/09/24/stephen-colbert-breaks-character-in-congressional-testimony-to-advocate-for-migrant-workers/ |archive-date=2010-10-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "

Democratic committee member [[John Conyers]] questioned whether it was appropriate for the comedian to appear before Congress and asked him to leave the hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2010/09/colbert_asked_t.html |work=The Boston Globe |first=Donovan |last=Slack |title=Stephen Colbert cracks jokes at Capitol Hill hearing |date=2010-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811113436/http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2010/09/colbert_asked_t.html |archivedate=August 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Colbert offered to depart at the direction of the committee chairwoman, Rep. Lofgren requested that he stay at least until all opening testimony had been completed, whereupon Conyers withdrew his request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/09/stephen-colbert-testifies-to-congress-today-on-immigration/1 |title=Colbert seriously jokes to Congress about migrant agricultural work |author=Douglas Stanglin |work=USA Today |date=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative pundits took aim at his Congress testimony not long after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aolnews.com/2010/09/24/stephen-colberts-congressional-testimony-apporpriate-or-waste/ |title=Stephen Colbert Faces Criticism for Congressional Testimony [VIDEO&amp;#93; |publisher=Aolnews.com |date=2010-09-24 |accessdate=2012-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125235407/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/09/24/stephen-colberts-congressional-testimony-apporpriate-or-waste/ |archivedate=2012-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"As John Conyers notes, the media and spectators turned out to see whether Colbert would address the panel seriously as an expert on immigration and make the panel a joke, or stay in character and make the panel a bigger joke," - [[Ed Morrissey]], [[Hot Air]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotair.com/archives/2010/09/24/conyers-to-colbert-we-love-you-but/ |title=Conyers to Colbert: We love you, but … « Hot Air |publisher=Hotair.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Keep Fear Alive" rally==
After [[Glenn Beck]]'s [[Restoring Honor rally]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], a user on [[Reddit]] suggested that Colbert hold his own Restoring Truthiness rally, and a website and Facebook page for the event were set up overnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/09/07/stephen-colbert-restoring-truthiness-rally/ |title=Stephen Colbert being courted for Restoring Truthiness rally |date=September 7, 2010 |author=Archana Ram |work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; A big announcement was first hinted at by [[Jon Stewart]] on September 7,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-september-7-2010/intro---announcement-of-momentous-importance |title=Intro - Announcement of Momentous Importance - The Daily Show with Jon Stewart - 09/07/10 - Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Thedailyshow.com |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; who ended the show with a [[Moment of Zen]] supposedly holding a clue about the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-september-7-2010/moment-of-zen---jon-s-important-announcement |title=Moment of Zen - Jon's Important Announcement - The Daily Show with Jon Stewart - 09/07/10 - Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Thedailyshow.com |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, Colbert acknowledged the online movement. He played a clip of Beck saying the geese at his event were sent by God, and insisted that he would need his own God geese to tell him to hold a rally. After consulting "Geese Witherspoon" and a bottle of Grey Goose vodka, Colbert responded to Stewart's announcement with a promise to make "an even bigger counter-announcement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/352238/september-07-2010/geese-witherspoon |title=Geese Witherspoon - The Colbert Report - 9/7/10 - Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Colbertnation.com |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, Stewart responded to Colbert's announcement by showing what was going on inside his brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-september-8-2010/intro---pre-announcement-brain-camera-zoom |title=Intro - Pre-Announcement Brain Camera Zoom - The Daily Show with Jon Stewart - 09/08/10 - Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Thedailyshow.com |date=September 8, 2010 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet again ended the show with an announcement-related Moment of Zen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-september-8-2010/moment-of-zen---another-clue-about-the-big-announcement |title=Moment of Zen - Another Clue About the Big Announcement - The Daily Show with Jon Stewart - 09/08/10 - Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Thedailyshow.com |date=September 8, 2010 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he did the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-september-9-2010/moment-of-zen---another-clue-to-jon-s-announcement |title=Moment of Zen - Another Clue to Jon's Announcement - The Daily Show with Jon Stewart - 09/09/10 - Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Thedailyshow.com |date=September 9, 2010 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following Monday, Colbert finally responded to Stewart, first mocking him for his facial hair, then responding to the "brain-cam" with his own "gut-cam." Colbert then brought up the online rally and how viewers were sending him toy geese and releasing doves outside his studio, finally asking people to stop sending him live animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/358980/september-13-2010/stop-sending-live-animals |title=Stop Sending Live Animals - The Colbert Report - 9/13/10 - Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Colbertnation.com |date=September 13, 2010 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To get Colbert's attention, Reddit users also encouraged people to donate to [[DonorsChoose]], a charity organization that benefits teachers across the country. In less than a day, members of the Colbert Nation raised over $100,000. As of October 28, 2010, Reddit raised more than $500,000.

September 15's ''Daily Show'' ended with a [[List of The Daily Show recurring segments#The Toss|toss]] to Colbert, and both acted coy about their competing announcements. That night's ''Colbert Report'' ended with Colbert announcing he would make his big announcement the next day, dropping hints that it would have to do with D.C. and the date October 10, 2010. On September 16, Colbert announced plans to host a 'Keep Fear Alive' rally on the [[National Mall]] on October 30, 2010.

The combined [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]] was duly held on October 30, attracting nearly a quarter of a million participants. As the result of the rally, Metrorail set a new Saturday ridership record of 825,437 trips, as compared to about 350,000 trips on a normal Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=4717 |title=Metro - About Metro - News - Metro sets new record for highest Saturday Metrorail ridership |publisher=Wmata.com |date=October 31, 2010 |accessdate=2013-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118193241/http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=4717 |archivedate=November 18, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colbert Super PAC==
{{main article|Colbert Super PAC}}
On March 10, 2011, during a segment on [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential contender]] [[Tim Pawlenty]]'s [[political action committee]] (PAC), Colbert announced the formation of his own PAC &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/377119/march-10-2011/colbert-pac-ad |title=Colbert PAC Ad - The Colbert Report - 3/10/11 - Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Colbertnation.com |date=March 10, 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hosted former [[Federal Election Commission|FEC]] Chairman [[Trevor Potter]] on the program to help him fill out the paperwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/379369/march-30-2011/colbert-pac---trevor-potter |title=Colbert PAC - Trevor Potter - The Colbert Report - 3/30/11 - Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Colbertnation.com |date=March 30, 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/382014/april-14-2011/colbert-super-pac---trevor-potter |title=Colbert Super PAC - Trevor Potter - The Colbert Report - 4/14/11 - Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Colbertnation.com |date=April 14, 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Troubled by the fact that large corporations were not donating to his SuperPAC,   Potter explained that corporations prefer to support political causes when the corporations can remain anonymous.  Therefore, he helped Colbert set up a [[501(c)(4)]] Delaware Shell corporation in which donations can be given anonymously without limit and used for political purposes. Colbert asked what the difference was between that and money laundering.  Potter answered, "It's hard to say." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/398531/september-29-2011/colbert-super-pac---trevor-potter---stephen-s-shell-corporation |title=Colbert Super PAC - Trevor Potter &amp; Stephen's Shell Corporation - The Colbert Report - 2011-29-09 - Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Colbertnation.com |date=2011-09-29 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 12, Colbert shut down his Super PAC, citing the death of his fictional advisor [[Carl Rove|Ham Rove]].  Potter advised him that by making a check with the remaining funds out to his 501(c)(4), with an "Agency Letter" telling it to transfer that money to a second anonymous 501(c)(4), he would not have to tell anyone - even the IRS - what happened to that money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colbert Super PAC SHH! - Secret Second 501(c)(4)|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/421160/november-12-2012/colbert-super-pac-shh----secret-second-501c4---trevor-potter|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Washington Redskins incident==
Following the creation of a non-profit organization by the owner of the [[Washington Redskins]], Colbert said that he would create the "Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever" in order to bring attention to the hypocrisy of the name. The following day, Suey Park created the hashtag #CancelColbert in order to draw attention to a tweet made by the Comedy Central-operated account of ''[[The Colbert Report]]''. Park interpreted the tweet, which repeated the line from Colbert's show, as a tasteless joke made at the expense of Asians and Asian-Americans. Park's hashtag became a trending topic on Twitter, and the tweet was later deleted.&lt;ref name=Kang&gt;{{cite news|last=Kang|first=Jay|title=The Campaign to "Cancel" Colbert|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2014/03/twitter-campaign-to-cancel-colbert-report.html|accessdate=31 March 2014|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the hashtag was trending, Park's efforts were widely criticized by the media. Later stating that he never wants "this to happen again," Colbert deleted the Comedy Central-run account on his show and directed people to follow his personal account.&lt;ref name=PeopleColbert&gt;{{cite web|last=Dowd|first=Kathy|title=Stephen Colbert Destroys His Show's Twitter Account After Controversy|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20802223,00.html|publisher=People|accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amazon.com and Hachette Book Group controversy==
On the June 4, 2014 episode, Colbert briefly broke down the details of a dispute that [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] was having with book publisher [[Hachette Book Group USA|Hachette]], who has printed every book he has authored (and is the issuer for thousands more authors). In an ''LA Times'' interview; fellow Hachette author [[James Patterson]] expressed fear in regard to the depths Amazon will go to maintain control over book pricing, publishing, and sales of any e-retail in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-amazon-and-hachette-explained-20140602-story.html#page=1/ |title=Amazon and Hachette in 13 easy steps |work=Los Angeles Times |author=Carolyn Kellogg |date=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main issue between the two companies is of [[e-book]] sales, and Amazon's lowering of prices to what certain publishers consider unsustainable for their business. Considering Amazon's domination when it comes to bookselling (between 40 and 50% of all book sales) and the myriad products it has since taken to selling due to its success with literature, it is slowing down or halting all sales of published or upcoming books produced by Hachette with no end in sight, notifying potential customers that it would be a better decision to shop elsewhere for any Hachette books. In response to his books being delayed or outright banned from being ordered, Colbert (as well as fellow Hachette author [[Sherman Alexie]]) encouraged the Colbert Nation to order ''[[California (novel)|California]]'' from first-time author [[Edan Lepucki]] from [[Portland, Oregon]] bookseller [[Powell's Books]] linked to Colbert's website (as well as "I Didn't Buy It on Amazon" stickers) and urged fans to refuse to purchase anything from Amazon until the conflict is resolved in a fair way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/t1nxwu/amazon-vs--hachette---sherman-alexie/ |title=Amazon vs. Hachette (Sherman Alexie)}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the July 21 episode, Colbert repeated the experiment, asking Lepucki for a recommendation of another Hachette author. Lepucki gave the nod to Stephan Eirik Clark who authored ''Sweetness #9''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/giving-another-debut-author-the-colbert-bump/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0|title=Giving Another Debut Author the Colbert Bump|author=Alexandra Alter|work=New York Times|date=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/8e5dyu/colbert-nation-vs--amazon---edan-lepucki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Demonware was founded in 2003 by [[Dylan Collins]] and Sean Blanchfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamedevelopers.ie/features/viewfeature.php?article=130 |title=Game Developers Ireland - Irish Game Development Community |publisher=Gamedevelopers.ie |date= |accessdate=11 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214163106/http://www.gamedevelopers.ie/features/viewfeature.php?article=130 |archivedate=14 February 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deal"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/activision-confirms-demonware-acquisition |title=Activision confirms Demonware acquisition &amp;#124; GamesIndustry International |publisher=Gamesindustry.biz |date=6 March 2007 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, the organisation was purchased by [[Activision]]. During the acquisition, Activision offered long-term contracts to the management team and employees of Demonware.&lt;ref name="deal"/&gt;

Mike Griffith, CEO of Activision, offered the following statement following the corporate acquisition:

'''The DiSTI Corporation''' is a company that provides software tools for the development of GUI software and 3D virtual training solutions for simulators and embedded systems.

== Company ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Virgin Galactic VMS Starboard Side.jpg|thumb|Virgin Glactic VMS Spaceship]] --&gt;
DiSTI concentrates its business on innovating software to produce high fidelity 2D and 3D graphical user interfaces to aid in the creation of simulated training, prototyping, and deployment of embedded systems. Their software is often used in the development for [[Virtual Maintenance Training]] systems, desktop trainers, as well as embedded avionics, automotive, and medical devices.

Their cornerstone product is the GL Studio Toolkit which has been implemented in the development of the embedded avionics for Scaled Composites&lt;ref&gt;Scaled Composites Official website. http://www.scaled.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and Virgin Galactic’s&lt;ref&gt;Virgin Galactic Official website. http://www.virgingalactic.com/&lt;/ref&gt; commercial spacecraft: the [[VSS Enterprise]] and [[VMS Eve]].

== History ==

DiSTI was formed by Joe Swinski, Darren Humphrey, and William (Bill) Andrews in 1994 in Orlando, Florida.

Swinski, Humphrey, and Andrews met while working together at the Institute for Simulation and Training (IST) at the [[University of Central Florida]] in Orlando, FL. At IST, Swinski, Humphrey, and Andrews were aiding in the development of simulation training classes for graduate students, but they saw an opportunity to give the simulation and training industry the same type of training solutions. What began as an opportunity to provide training classes to the industry, culminated into a full-fledged software and training [[solution]]s company.

It was under a [[SBIR]] (Small Business Innovation Research) contract, completed June 24, 2000, that DiSTI developed the GL Studio toolkit. DiSTI now makes software that help developers create virtual training environments to teach technical, complex activities such as maintenance on airplanes, engines and power plants. DiSTI's patented software also creates [[human-machine interfaces]] such as dashboards, gauges, and control screens.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Daniel P. 2010, May 20. “DiSTI Poised for Growth in Software Development”. Orlando Business Journal. http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2010/05/24/smallb1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

DiSTI technologies and [[solution]]s are used by companies worldwide, including [[Boeing]], [[Lockheed Martin]], [[Honeywell]], [[Raytheon]], [[Thales Group]], [[BAE Systems]], [[Dassault Group]], among many others.

== Products ==
In 2011, DiSTI changed their product offering. They introduced their latest interactive software application, Replic8 and re-organized their GL Studio offering to introduce a new toolkit that streamlines the creation of interfaces for enhanced embedded applications. This introduction became a part of DiSTI's repackaging move in order to more closely match different global vertical market demands.&lt;ref&gt;Janakiraman, Shamila. 2011, Nov. 23. “DiSTI Unveils Enhanced Version of its GL Studio Software Toolkit”.

{{Update|date=November 2010}}

In the [[United States]], [[digital television]] broadcasts, or DTV, can be received via [[cable television|cable]], via [[internet television|internet]], via [[satellite television|satellite]], or via [[digital terrestrial television]] - much like analog television broadcasts have been. Full-power analog television broadcasts, however, were required by U.S. federal law to cease by June 12, 2009. [[Low-power broadcasting|Low-power]], [[Class A television service|Class A]], and [[Relay transmitter|TV Translator]] stations are not currently required to cease analog broadcasts. Also by law, digital broadcasts - when transmitted as OTA signals - must conform to [[ATSC standards]].;&lt;ref&gt;FCC. [http://www.dtv.gov/consumercorner.html The Digital TV Transition FAQs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424195927/http://www.dtv.gov/consumercorner.html |date=2008-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is unclear whether satellite operators are free to use their own proprietary standards{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}; and many standards exist for Internet television (most are proprietary).

== Standards ==
{{main|ATSC standards}}
The U.S. opted to adhere to [[ATSC standards]] for broadcast digital television. These standards define, among other things, format and transmission criteria that ensure consistency, accessibility, and fairness for consumers and equipment manufacturers alike in the U.S., as well as international compatibility.

=== Format standards ===
{{main|High-definition television in the United States}}

The five main ATSC formats of DTV currently broadcast in the U.S. are:
* [[Standard-definition television|Standard definition]]&amp;mdash;480i, to maintain compatibility with existing [[NTSC]] sets when a digital television broadcast is converted back to an analog one{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}&amp;mdash;either by a [[Coupon-eligible converter box|converter box]] or a cable/satellite operator's [[Cable converter box|proprietary equipment]]
* [[Enhanced-definition television|Enhanced definition]]&amp;mdash;480p, about the same quality as current DVDs
* [[High-definition television|High definition]]&amp;mdash;720p
* [[High-definition television|High definition]]&amp;mdash;1080i
* [[High-definition television|High definition]]&amp;mdash;1080p (only used by a few cable operators, currently no terrestrial stations broadcast in 1080p)

Most digital television sets sold in the U.S. use a display with a 16:9 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] to optimally display HDTV-formatted content.  Lower-resolution sources like regular DVDs may be upscaled to the native resolution of the TV.

=== Transmission standards ===
==== Pay television ====
Currently, most Americans get digital television broadcasts via cable or satellite.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Digital cable television systems with an activated channel capacity of 750 MHz or greater, are required by the FCC to follow ANSI/SCTE transmission standards with the exception of cable systems that only pass through 8 VSB modulated signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=cb3287ea38e90d35336a20d80a2b3339&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=47:4.0.1.1.4.11.3.15&amp;idno=47 |title=76.640   Support for unidirectional digital cable products on digital cable systems. |publisher=Government Printing Office |date=8 Nov 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009063612/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=cb3287ea38e90d35336a20d80a2b3339&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=47%3A4.0.1.1.4.11.3.15&amp;idno=47 |archivedate=2012-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital television sets (equipped with ATSC tuners) are often capable of viewing a baseline set of unencrypted digital programming, known as [[basic cable]] or low-tier channels, which typically include local network television affiliates. According to [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] regulations, the remaining encrypted channels must be viewable with a receiver equipped with a [[CableCARD]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.

==== Terrestrial ====
Digital television transmissions over-the-air (OTA) are now available in most metropolitan areas in the U.S., often carrying both standard-definition and high-definition (HDTV) transmissions of the same stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antennaweb.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202202431/http://www.antennaweb.org/ |archivedate=2012-02-02 |df= }} AntennaWeb&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, by the analog shut-off date of June 12, 2009, all Full Power OTA stations in the U.S. will, by law, have to either transmit their broadcasts digitally, or shut down.

Many stations have already used the switch to digital transmission as an opportunity to transition from 480i broadcasts to digital HD OTA broadcasts (either in 720p or 1080i), though this change is voluntary.

Within a distance of 35 to 40 miles from the broadcast stations, it is possible that no equipment more special than perhaps a simple antenna (such as "rabbit ears") may be necessary to receive a DTV broadcast signal OTA—at least some of the time for some of the channels.  Any television equipped with an ATSC tuner may display DTV broadcasts properly.  Some customers are already discovering that terrain, trees, rain, snow, wind, and even the movement of people around the room interfere with reception to one degree or another, from signals breaking up to total loss of signal. (Few ATSC-equipped televisions or converter boxes have internal antennas, in contrast to analog sets available in years past).

== Transition from analog to digital terrestrial broadcasts in 2009 ==
{{main|DTV transition in the United States}}

It was estimated that as of April 2007, 28% of American households had an HDTV set, a total of 35 million sets, and that 86% of owners were highly satisfied with the HDTV programming&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wkyc.com/weblog/directors_cut/2007/04/news-hdtv-penetration-at-28.html|title=WKYC's Director's Cut with Frank Macek: News: HDTV Penetration at 28%&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=wkyc.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130209223104/http://www.wkyc.com/weblog/directors_cut/2007/04/news-hdtv-penetration-at-28.html|archivedate=9 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates are that by the end of 2010, some 59% of American TVs had transitioned to HDTVs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} All TV stations currently broadcast in both digital and analog and major networks broadcast in HD in most markets.

While many in the industry wanted a flexible or delayed deadline, the FCC forced the issue at the behest of Congress. Congress wanted to reclaim some of the spectrum used for analog and repurpose that for emergency services. They also wanted to [[auction]] off bandwidth between 76-88&amp;nbsp;MHz frequencies ([[Channel 5 (disambiguation)|channels 5]] and [[Channel 6 (disambiguation)|6]]) and old analog UHF channels 60 to 69, and channels 52 to 59 by mandating DTV [[ATSC tuner|tuner]]s be phased into all new TV sets.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}   Many transition dates were proposed, but Congress finally fixed February 17, 2009 (later extending it until June 12, 2009), in law as the maximum end date for analog television authorizations.&lt;ref&gt;47 [[United States Code|USC]] 309(j)(14)(A) {{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/casecode/uscodes/47/chapters/5/subchapters/iii/parts/i/sections/section_309.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206122536/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/casecode/uscodes/47/chapters/5/subchapters/iii/parts/i/sections/section_309.html |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }} as amended by section 3002 of S.1932 signed into law February 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Because this date comes after the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Bowl Championship Series]] and the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Super Bowl XLIII]], there will be less of a chance of an acute hardware shortage from people waiting until the last minute to purchase an [[ATSC tuner]] than there would have been with a January 1 cutoff.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The original deadline of January 1, 2006 was abolished when it was realized that TV stations and customers would not be able to meet the earlier deadline.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment on turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5 and 6 (76–88&amp;nbsp;MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital television transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed to June 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regulations.gov/fdmspublic/component/main?main=DocumentDetail&amp;o=090000648064a653|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227021445/http://www.regulations.gov/fdmspublic/component/main?main=DocumentDetail&amp;o=090000648064a653|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-12-27|title=In the Matter of Promoting Diversification of Ownership in the Broadcasting Services|author=Federal Communications Commission|date=2008-05-16|accessdate=2008-08-26|quote=Certain commenters have urged the Commission to give a "hard look" to a proposal that the Commission re-allocate TV Channels 5 and 6 for FM broadcasting}} {{USFR|73|28400}}, 28403&lt;/ref&gt; This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies corresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76&amp;nbsp;MHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioworld.com/article/67266 Could EXB Band Be Your New Home?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506025738/http://radioworld.com/article/67266 |date=2009-05-06 }}''RadioWorld'' September 10, 2008 &lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, VHF Channels 5 and 6 were retained for digital broadcast television use after the transition, though the FCC had continued researching the possibility of re-allocating the two channels to an expanded FM band.

On August 22, 2011, the [[United States of America|United States]]' [[Federal Communications Commission]] announced a freeze on all future applications for broadcast stations requesting to use channel 51,&lt;ref name="FCCUHF51"&gt;FCC[http://transition.fcc.gov/Document_Indexes/Media/2011_index_MB_Public_Notice.html Public Notice DA-11-1428A1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228082233/http://transition.fcc.gov/Document_Indexes/Media/2011_index_MB_Public_Notice.html |date=2013-02-28 }}:

=== Early rollout of transition ===
On May 8, 2008, FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin announced the agency would test run the transition to digital terrestrial television in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], beginning September 8, 2008. This test run was to work out problems that might have occurred before the complete transition.

'''''Dustforce''''' is a [[platform game|platform video game]] developed by Hitbox Team. The game was released in January 2012 for [[Microsoft Windows]] via [[Steam (software)|Steam]], and [[Mac OS X]] through Steam in May 2012. A [[Linux]] port was released as part of the [[Humble Indie Bundle|Humble Indie Bundle 6]]. [[Capcom]] published the game for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation Vita]], and [[Xbox 360]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/dustforce-is-heading-to-the-360-vita-and-ps3-261064.phtml  | title = Dustforce is heading to the 360, Vita, and PS3 | publisher = [[Destructoid]] | date = 2013-08-31 | accessdate = 2013-08-31 | first = Chris | last = Carter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the game, the player controls one of four janitors who are attempting to sweep away a world corrupted with dust and filth. The player uses a number of acrobatic skills, such as [[wikt:double jump|double jump]]ing and [[wall jump]]ing to progress through the game's fifty-some levels, cleaning sections covered by leaves and attacking filth-covered creatures to score and progress through the level.  The player's performance is ranked based on time and completion, and access to certain levels requires near-perfect runs of earlier levels.

==Gameplay==
''Dustforce'' is a [[platform game]] that has been compared to games such as ''[[Super Meat Boy]]'' and ''[[N+]]'', where fast-response timed actions are considered necessary to complete the game. It is set in a world where filth has corrupted the creatures that live in the area; the four-member Dustforce team of janitors aims to clean up the mess and restore the world. An [[overworld]] provides access to more than fifty levels, though about half are initially locked to the player.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"/&gt;

[[File:Dustforce - Screenshot 04.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The player controls an agile sweeper as they clear away leaves and defeat creatures across the landscape.]]
After the player selects a level, they pick one of the four Dustforce members, who all share the same moves but have slightly different statistics, such as jumping height. Within the level, the player must maneuver their character to the end goal using acrobatic tricks such as [[double jump (video game)|double jump]]s, [[wall jump]]s, mid-air dashes, and clinging to the ceiling. Along the way, the character will automatically sweep up any debris on the walls or floors. The player can also initiate regular and super-attacks against filth-covered creatures to restore them to normal. The end goal of a level typically requires reaching a final area and defeating foes waiting there. Should the character run into any hazards such as pits or spikes on the level, the player will have to resume the run from a previous checkpoint.&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt;

Upon completing a level, the player is ranked based on "finesse" and completion. Finesse is determined by the combo meter, which is reset if the player takes a hit or proceeds too slowly, and completion is determined by the amount of debris and enemies cleaned. The ratings, evaluated separately, are based on a letter-grade scale, with "D" through "A" reflecting increasingly better performances, and an "S" grade, representing a perfect combo, or full completion. Completing a level with an "S" grade in both finesse and completion provides the player with one of three colored keys to unlock certain levels in the overworld.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"/&gt;

The player is also rated on a scoring system and ranked on a global leaderboard.  The player scores a fixed number of points for every patch of filth that is cleaned up multiplied by their current combo meter, and increases their current combo meter by 1.  The combo meter only stays active for a short period of time, but resets for each patch cleaned up; thus by hitting many patches in a row quickly, the player can build up the combo multiplier and drastically increase their score. Player replays are stored online with the leaderboards, allowing other players to review how top scorers were able to complete various levels.&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt; The PlayStation 3 version will include the ability to save and share level replays to YouTube, while this, the Vita, and Xbox 360 version will include the ability to save replays locally.&lt;ref name="polygon capcom"/&gt;

''Dustforce'' includes a four-player local multiplayer mode including variants such as Survival and [[King of the Hill (game)|King of the Hill]] modes, where players scale the level and fight against other players towards victory. Players can act as the janitors, cleaning up filth, while the other players lay down filth on clean patches of the level.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"/&gt;

A [[level editor]] for both single player and multiplayer maps was released as part of a patch for the Windows version of the game and the debut of the Mac OS X version. Levels are shared through a website created by Hitbox Team.&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/169543/The_long_awaited_Mac_version_ofnbsp_DUSTFORCEnbsparriveswith_annbspingame_level_editor_and_onlinenbsplevelservernbsp_Now_available_on_Mac_and_PC_for_50_off.php | title = The long awaited Mac version of  DUSTFORCE arrives with an in-game level editor and online level server - Now available on Mac and PC for 50% off | publisher = [[Hitbox Team]] | date = 2012-05-01 | accessdate = 2012-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PlayStation and Xbox versions includes 150 user-generated level as voted on by players.&lt;ref name="polygon capcom"/&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Dustforce Trailer.webm|thumb|thumbtime=75|320px|The Dustforce team race through this gameplay trailer sweeping up the filth from the world.]]
Designer Woodley Nye came up with the idea one day while sweeping a pile of leaves.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/interview-hitbox-team-on-the-art-and-design-of-dustforce-215362.phtml | title = Interview: Hitbox Team on the art and design of Dustforce| publisher =Destructoid | date =November 10, 2011 | accessdate = May 15, 2014| first = Jason| last = Cabral}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team was working on another game at the time but switched to ''Dustforce'' when they heard about the Indiepub contest.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt; In designing the game Nye wanted to create an acrobatic 2D platformer. He credits the games ''[[N (video game)|N]]'' and ''Nikujin'' as inspirations for the project.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt; Hitbox has also stated that the game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' was an influence to the team citing its easy pick up and play approach while still maintaining a level of depth for experienced players.&lt;ref name="Capcom"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.capcom-unity.com/xantista/blog/2014/01/29/dustforce-q-a-an-interview-with-hitbox-team | title = Dustforce Q &amp; A: An interview with Hitbox Team| publisher =Capcom| accessdate = May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In selecting the art style Nye opted for a simplistic style that would showcase the various frames of animation. He has cited ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' as an influence in terms of design aesthetic stating that "they have great poses and also good shapes".&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt;

''Dustforce'' won the $100,000 Grand Prize at indiePub Games' Third Independent Game Developers Competition at the 2010 [[Game Developers Conference]] Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/63882/ldquoDUSTFORCErdquo_BY_HITBOX_TEAM_WINS_GRAND_PRIZE_ININDIEPUB_GAMESrsquo_THIRD_INDEPENDENT_GAME_DEVELOPERSCOMPETITION_AT_GDC_ONLINE.php | title = 'Dustforce' by Hitbox Team wins Grand Prize in IndiePub Games Third Independent Games Developers Competition at GDC Online | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 2010-10-08 | accessdate  =2012-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The money was used by the four-person Hitbox team to develop the game over about one and a half years.&lt;ref name="sales"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://gamasutra.com/blogs/TerenceLee/20130417/190637/Dustforce_sales_figures.php |title=Dustforce sales figures|last=Lee | first=Terence | date = 2013-04-17 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | accessdate= 2013-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After about a year of its successful release on Microsoft Windows, Capcom talked to Hitbox about porting the title to consoles. Capcom used their localization team, [[QLoc]], to support the transition to console and managing features like leaderboards and replay saving. The console version will include 150 user-created levels from the Windows version as voted on by players.&lt;ref name="polygon capcom"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2013/10/11/4828258/dustforce-porting-high-speed-platforming-capcom-nycc-2013 | title = Capcom on porting Dustforce's high-speed platforming to consoles | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | date =2013-10-11 | accessdate = 2013-10-11 | first = Samit | last = Sarkar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January 2012, the developers announced in a blog post that the game would be released in a week's time, on 17 January 2012. The blog post, which also contained a gameplay trailer (right), surprised the gaming media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Priestman|first=Chris|title=‘Dustforce’ Coming To Steam January 17th, New Trailer Released|url=http://www.indiegamemag.com/dustforce-coming-to-steam-january-17th-new-trailer-released/|work=The Indie Game Magazine|publisher=Newton Publishing Limited|accessdate=9 May 2014|date=10 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515093845/http://www.indiegamemag.com/dustforce-coming-to-steam-january-17th-new-trailer-released/|archivedate=15 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DX Update ===

On October 23, 2014, Hitbox announced on their website that a free update to Dustforce, Dustforce DX, was available to all owners of the base game. The DX update added 109 community maps accessible through an in-game console, a new music track by Lifeformed, and support for Steam trading cards.&lt;ref name="PCGames DX Article"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benson|first1=Julia|title=Dustforce DX update tidies up levels to make it easier for new players|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/dustforce/dustforce-dx-update-tidies-up-levels-to-make-it-easier-for-new-players|website=PCGamesN|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The update also included changes designed to make the game friendlier to newer players. The single [[tutorial]] was broken into 3 separate maps, 16 easier levels were added, and the 4 world hubs were consolidated into a single area. The [[overworld]] redesign makes it more difficult to reach the harder levels. According to Hitbox developer Woodley Nye, the redesign “helps in two ways: it keeps new players away from levels they aren't ready for yet, and it serves as a teaching tool for more advanced techniques that are required in the tougher levels.”&lt;ref name="Hitbox DX blog post"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nye|first1=Woodley|title=Dustforce DX update released|url=http://hitboxteam.com/dustforce-dx-update-released|accessdate=20 June 2017|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dustforce'' was generally well received by critics, praised for its demanding gameplay, online leaderboard features, graphics, and soundtrack.  Kyle Orland of [[Ars Technica]], was pleased with the difficulty of the game even after facing levels he could not complete, and considered ''Dustforce'' as "a game that's not content to let you be content with yourself, and for that it's definitely worth playing".&lt;ref name="arstech review"/&gt; Marsh Davies of [[Eurogamer]] considered that once a player can work their way through a level with perfect completion, "it's hard not to admire the pat precision of the controls or deny the transcendent joy of a high-ranking run".&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"/&gt; The use of reviewing online replays was highly praised to help players that were stumbling with the game. [[IGN]]'s Anthony Gallegos considered the replays to be not only "awesome and humbling" to review, but also aiding in teaching the player of new techniques.&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt; Several noted that ''Dustforce'' is the type of game that a player may get frustrated with quickly after replaying levels over and over to get the "S" grades, but this emotion is calmed by the game's graphics and music. ''[[PC Gamer (US)|PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s Lucas Sullivan considered that the combination of the "soothing, ethereal background music" and "fluid animations and beautifully stylized character designs" provided a [[zen]]-like meditative setting for the player to practice within.&lt;ref name="pcgamer review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/review/dustforce-review/ | title = Dustforce review | first = Lucas | last= Sullivan | date = 2012-02-10 | accessdate  = 2012-02-14 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan Grayson of [[GameSpy]] considered that "the whole audio-visual package colludes to create a strikingly powerful soothing effect" that contrasts the tight demands of the gameplay.&lt;ref name="gamespy review"/&gt;

Some reviewers noted that the game fails to fully explain some of its features through the simplistic menus.  There is no immediate information about the differences between the characters when selecting one prior to a level,&lt;ref name="ign review"&gt;{{cite web | url  = http://pc.ign.com/articles/121/1216773p1.html | title = Dustforce Review | date = 2012-01-18 | accessdate = 2012-01-30 | first = Anthony | last = Gallegos | publisher = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespy review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/dustforce/1216700p1.html | title = Dustforce Review | first = Nathan | last = Grayson | date = 2012-01-18 | accessdate =2012-01-30 | publisher = [[GameSpy]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the multiplayer mode is not well explained.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/dustforce/reviews/dustforce-review-6348739/ | title = Dustforce Review | first = Maxwell | last = McGee | date = 2012-01-19 | accessdate= 2012-02-14 | publisher = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others noted that the multiplayer mode felt like an add-on, and without online connectivity, would likely not be a feature many gamers would play.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-01-25-dustforce-review | title = Dustforce Review | first = Marsh | last = Davies | date = 2012-01-25 | accessdate = 2012-01-30 | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arstech review"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/reviews/2012/01/dustforce-review-a-wonderfully-maddening-focus-on-player-perfection.ars | title = Dustforce review: A wonderfully maddening focus on player perfection | first = Kyle | last =Orland | publisher = [[Ars Technica]] | date = 2012-01-24 | accessdate  =2012-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the game defaults to the use of keyboard controls, several found these to be a hindrance and switched to a [[gamepad]], which had to be configured manually.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt; Some reviewers also noted that the game has some performance issues based on its initial release.&lt;ref name="gamespy review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metro review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/games/888104-dustforce-review-clean-sweep | title = Dustforce review&amp;nbsp;– clean sweep | first = Roger | last = Hargreaves | date = 2012-01-23 | accessdate = 2012-02-14 | work = [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales of the game were boosted by both being featured in a mid-week Steam promotion in May 2012, its inclusion in the Humble Bundle, and further discounts during 2012 holiday season sales. Hitbox states that the team directly earned [[United States dollar|US$]] 489,000 after one year of sales, which will be used to fund development of their next game, ''Spire''.&lt;ref name="sales"/&gt;

To determine whether a potential online gambler should be allowed to deposit, play or even view an online casino it is necessary to determine the individual's physical location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beem|first=Betsi|last2=Mikler|first2=John|date=September 2011|title=National regulations for a borderless industry: US versus UK approaches to online gambling|journal=Policy and Society|volume=30|issue=3|pages=161–174|doi=10.1016/j.polsoc.2011.07.001|issn=1449-4035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online casinos and poker rooms have used geolocation in various ways over time. The first online casinos existed when few laws governed the internet (let alone online gambling), and players were simply asked to state their location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8891272|title=Internet Gambling: Issues, Concerns, and Recommendations|last=Griffiths|first=Mark|date=2004-01-01|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As laws regulating online gambling were passed, it became necessary to use technology to prove the physical location of players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marketa|first=Trimble,|date=2012|title=Proposal for an International Convention on Online Gambling|url=https://scholars.law.unlv.edu/facpub/698/?utm_source=scholars.law.unlv.edu/facpub/698&amp;utm_medium=PDF&amp;utm_campaign=PDFCoverPages|journal=Scholarly Commons @ UNLV Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
When the first hand of licensed and regulated online poker in the United States was dealt in Nevada on April 30, 2013 by [[UltimatePoker.com]], the site relied on a combination of a player's IP address and [[GPS]] signal from their cellular phone. Many players experienced problems from this process that made it difficult or even impossible for them to be correctly geolocated in Nevada and prevented them from playing. Initially players located near the state's borders could not be geolocated with enough precision to allow them to pass the Nevada location check. People who did not have mobile phones could not play at all.

As the industry expanded to the state of New Jersey, a new method of geolocation was deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.njgamblingwebsites.com/geolocation-technology-works-new-jersey/|title=FAQ About How Geolocation Technology Works In New Jersey|date=2018-04-09|work=NJ Gambling Websites|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method triangulated wifi networks near the player to determine his or her physical location. This method was much more precise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Abdou|first=Abdelrahman|last2=Matrawy|first2=Ashraf|last3=C. van Oorschot|first3=Paul|date=2014-12-23|title=Location verification on the Internet: Towards enforcing location-aware access policies over Internet clients|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289862505|journal=2014 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security, CNS 2014|pages=175–183|doi=10.1109/CNS.2014.6997484|isbn=978-1-4799-5890-0|citeseerx=10.1.1.648.45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players reported fewer difficulties and even those located close to New Jersey's border could still correctly pass the geolocation check.

In order to prevent players outside a regulated state from bypassing the geolocation test using VPNs, the software checks for VPN and remote access software running on the player's system. If any such software is detected, the player is not allowed to wager.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.caesarscasino.com/hc/en-us/articles/229968868-If-I-have-remote-desktop-software-such-as-LogMeIn-or-GoToMyPC-actively-running-on-my-laptop-or-desktop-can-I-still-be-accurately-geo-located-|title=If I have remote desktop software, such as LogMeIn or GoToMyPC, actively running on my laptop or desktop, can I still be accurately geo-located?|website=CaesarsCasino.com|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
In 2018, Pennsylvania became the fourth US state to license and regulate the industry. One requirement in Pennsylvania is that online gambling is not permitted inside brick and mortar casinos. This presents the unique challenge of disallowing play in certain physical locations within a state in which online gambling is otherwise authorized. Additionally in 2018 the [[U.S. Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]] found the national [[Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992]] to be [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]], paving the way for states to authorize sports betting. Since mobile device sports betting is an popular pastime, more states are likely to require geolocation services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.legalsportsreport.com/24571/west-virginia-mobile-sports-betting-at-hollywood-casino/|title=WV Mobile Sports Betting Just Weeks Away, Hollywood Casino Exec Says|date=2018-09-28|work=Legal Sports Report|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ghost Theory''''' is an [[Indie video game|indie]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Dreadlocks Ltd]]. It is a [[first-person adventure game|first-person adventure]] [[horror fiction|horror]], designed to be a serious take on [[ghost hunting]] and [[paranormal research]], featuring real-world [[Haunted house|haunted locations]].

==Overview==
Intrigued by the player's supernatural talent of [[clairvoyance]], a struggling university department asks them to join their secret research team, making them a front-field operative in paranormal investigations. Using a wide range of ghost-hunting gadgets and abilities they will conduct missions to investigate real haunted sites, collect samples and gather evidence.

Each mission is an open-ended haunted ground - a playable sandbox with its own story. The university is the player's home base, where their work will be evaluated, results assessed and where they will be briefed for their next mission.

== Gameplay ==

Even though this is a horror game, ghosts won't appear without provocation. It is the player's task to find out how, to meet their objectives.

During missions, ambidexterity will be a plus. The player's left hand will operate most of their gadgets and their right will interact with objects around them: turning a doorknob, pushing a door gently ajar, unearthing remains...

== Gadgets ==
*'''Voice Log Recorder''' - serves to record and replay comments about objects and situations within a mission.
*'''UV Lamp''' - reveals what the player's eyes cannot: most importantly, valuable samples of ectoplasm.
*'''Full Spectrum Camera''' - a tool for obtaining hard evidence of paranormal activity.
*'''EMF (ElectroMagnetic Field) Meter''' - by zeroing in on energy spikes, the player can detect and track paranormal activity and lead themselves towards items and locations that are important to the ghost they are hunting.
*'''EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) Recorder''' - captures the voices of ghosts. Recordings are valuable evidence for the player's investigation and will often reveal valuable clues.
*'''Pendulum''' - used for divination. First it needs to be charged by an object (e.g. a single recovered earring). It can then be used to find an associated object (the missing earring).

== Process ==
Sudden drops in temperature indicate the close proximity of a supernatural presence. The player should keep an eye out for the telltale sign: breath condensation. When the terror gets too intense, the player can press a button to close their eyes for as long as needed. Sometimes, when the player closes their eyes as they touch an object, visions appear. Their clairvoyance allows the player to experience flashbacks associated with an object's history, which may feed the player important information about a ghost’s past or reveal further clues connected to the investigation.

== Development and release==
The game was announced at the [[Game Developers Session]] 2015 and was scheduled to be released in Q4 2017. On February 12, 2016, the game was greenlit on Steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/comments/605798163 |title=Ghost Theory |publisher=Steam |date= |accessdate=2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 13, 2016 it went live on KickStarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dreadlocks/ghost-theory-a-serious-take-on-paranormal-research |title=Ghost Theory - A serious take on paranormal research |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, according to the game's official website and the Steam Greenlight page, the game has been delayed to Q4 2018.  However, no news has been provided by the developers to support that claim.  Some are speculating that the project has been cancelled without refunding the money back to their generous backers.    No news about the overall progress of the game has been announced since 2017, leaving the fans disappointed and frustrated.

'''Hanan Goldblatt''' ({{lang-he|חנן גולדבלט}}; born 10 October 1941 in [[Tel Aviv]]) is an [[Israel]]i actor, comedian and singer who appeared in plays, films, television programs, and who was most widely known for his part in the educational TV show "[[Bli Sodot]]". In 2008, Goldblatt was convicted of perpetrating acts of [[rape]] as well as other [[sex offenses]] against women in his acting class.

== Biography ==
Hanan Goldblatt was born in 1941 in [[Tel Aviv]]. In his youth Goldblatt studied in the youth village [[HaKfar HaYarok]] along with [[Yisrael Poliakov]], and together they performed in various skits in the events and parties. Goldblatt did his mandatory military service in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] in the Nahal troupe, the military band of the [[Nahal Brigade]].

After Goldblatt finished his military service he founded the band "[[HaTarnegolim]]" (The Roosters) together with several veteran members of Israeli military bands, under the musical guidance of [[Naomi Polani]]. In the early 1960s Goldblatt left the band in favor a theater career. In 1962 Goldblatt participated in the play "Root of All Evil" (שורש כל רע) at the Hamam Club in Jaffa, in which he played alongside [[Yoram Gaon]], [[Bomba Tzur]], [[Yosef Carmon]] and [[Margalit Ankori]].

In 1966, Goldblatt played in the Israeli musical film "[[The Flying Matchmaker]]" alongside [[Mike Burstyn]], [[Mordechai Arnon]] and [[Oshik Levy]]. In the late 1960s Goldblatt established the entertainment trio "Shlishyat HaTeomim" (שלישיית התאומים) together with Mordechai Arnon and Oshik Levy, which performed until 1970.

After the entertainment trio was disbanded, Goldblatt traveled to the United States. At the end of the 1970s, he returned to Israel and joined the staff of the children TV series "Carousel" (קרוסלה), in which he portrayed the balloon seller "Hanan Annan". Afterwards Goldblatt participated in the Educational TV series "[[Bli Sodot]]" in which he portrayed the detective "Gashash Balash". Following the series, the participants of the series raised a theatrical show for children.

During the 1980s, Goldblatt wrote the children's play "An amazing moment in the carousel" (רגע מדהים בקרוסלה) in which he also performed alongside [[Tzipi Moore]] and the magician Yoreinu (יוריני). During those years Goldblatt produced a solo album which included only songs he wrote by himself. During this period Goldblatt began directing shows for military bands, and appeared in the movies "[[Melech LeYom Ehad]]" (1982), "[[Ko'ach Meshiha]]" (1988), "[[Irit, Irit]]" (1985), and more.

During the 1990s Goldblatt participated in children's educational TV show "[[BeSod HaInyanim]]", and directed the summer TV show "Dagi Digitaly".

Through the years Goldblatt dubbed the voices of various characters in Israeli Hebrew-speaking TV shows and films.

In addition to his career as a performing actor, through the years Goldblatt also taught theater in a number of acting schools. In 2004 Goldblatt began hosting the program "אדם ומלואו" at [[Channel 33 (Israel)|Channel 33]] (after the sudden death of former host [[Uzi Hitman]]). In addition, Goldblatt played a cameo role in two episodes of the Israeli sitcom "[[HaPijamot]]" as Micah, the uncle of [[Alona Tal]].

=== Sex crimes conviction ===
In August 2005, Goldblatt was arrested on suspicion of acts of [[rape]] and [[sodomy]] at various acting students, among them several [[minor (law)|minor]]s, who came to his apartment to study [[acting]]. His arrest came after three young women complained to police. Six more women came forward and pressed charges soon afterward, although two of these cases could not be prosecuted as the statute of limitations had expired. Some of the complainants had been minors when the offenses were carried out. Police determined there was sufficient evidence for an indictment, and Goldblatt was indicted in the Tel Aviv District Court on August 21, 2005. Goldblatt denied the accusations and pleaded not guilty, claiming he never forced himself on any of the complainants. On July 3, 2008, following a lengthy trial, Goldblatt was convicted of two counts of rape and sodomy, two counts of indecent assault, committing an indecent act, abuse of authority, and aggravated fraud. He was acquitted of two counts of attempted indecent assault, one count of assault, one count of attempted rape, and one count of fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3563674,00.html |title=Actor Hanan Goldblatt convicted of rape - Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.court.gov.il/BookReader/getbook.asp?path=%5C%5C172.25.40.101%5Cidc_repository%5C86%5C109%5CFA886E61A8234601B0F92D425DC66CE2&amp;OlvDataProto=file&amp;Language=Hebrew&amp;Hebrew=1&amp;ReaderStyle=ILCourts&amp;h=5AA0395FEB5043125AC26FFF4E824650&amp;OnePageMode=1 Untitled document - Olive Enterprise Publisher]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/actor-hanan-goldblatt-faces-six-new-sexual-assault-complaints-1.166701 Actor Hanan Goldblatt faces six new sexual assault complaints]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/actor-hanan-goldblatt-charged-with-rape-and-other-sexual-offenses-1.167620 Actor Hanan Goldblatt charged with rape and other sexual offenses]&lt;/ref&gt; The court referred to Goldblatt's assertion, noting: 	

{{Cquote|In our case, in all of the charges the defendant argued that the complainants distorted reality or cherry picked random details and connect those details incorrectly. In all of the charges he claimed that the acts were committed as part of a mutual agreement and as part of a romance or [[Casual relationship|fling]], and that in none of the events he intended to deceive the complainants. Nevertheless, the actions described by the complainants whose complaints became outdated, as well as the charges in the indictment indicate that there is no basis for the defendant's claim that the relations were mutually agreed upon, and that he is innocent, and had no intention to deceive any one, and they sufficiently prove a criminal intent, as opposed to a random act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robolo.co.il/7/2008/7/3/001133_05.asp RoBoLo - מידע משפטי, פסקי דין, עורכי דין, תביעות, ייעוץ משפטי]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The court noted that "the events took place over many years, beginning in 1986 and lasted until 2004" and various other women were also offended, but due to the statute of limitations Goldblatt would only be tried on his subsequent offenses.

During his trial, Goldblatt noted that in some cases he was frivolous, and that some of the complainants' were offended by him in one way or another. Goldblatt was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment, 2 years probation, and was ordered to pay 25,000 [[New Israeli shekel|NIS]] in compensation to two of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.court.gov.il/BookReader/getbook.asp?path=%5C%5C172.25.40.101%5Cidc_repository%5C945%5C106%5C881B1A0363DD49F38832CC914E661DBE&amp;OlvDataProto=file&amp;Language=Hebrew&amp;Hebrew=1&amp;ReaderStyle=ILCourts&amp;h=9840E34786B55465B2512B76F1430678&amp;OnePageMode=1 Untitled document - Olive Enterprise Publisher]&lt;/ref&gt; Goldblatt appealed to the Supreme Court on his conviction and of the punishment imposed on him. In February 2011 the Supreme Court partially accepted Goldblatt's appeal (as it replaced one of the two rape offenses of which he was convicted with fraud under aggravating circumstances), and cut his prison sentence by one year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/08/330/107/m12/08107330.m12.htm פסק-דין בתיק ע"פ 10733/08]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the state began seizing Goldblatt's assets after he refused to pay court-ordered compensation to two his victims, and ignored two demands for 50,000 NIS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/government-to-force-actor-to-compensate-rape-victims-1.278537 Government to force actor to compensate rape victims]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 2012, Goldblatt was granted early release by the Board of Pardons for good behavior in prison and participation in rehabilitation programs. His actual release was delayed a week for the prosecution to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Convicted-rapist-Goldblatt-may-be-released-early Convicted rapist Goldblatt may be released early]&lt;/ref&gt; On November 25, 2012, Goldblatt was released from prison after having served four years. He confessed that he had been guilty, and apologized for his actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4311524,00.html Hanan Goldblatt released from jail, says he regrets his actions]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hand pay''' (or '''handpay''') is a condition where a [[slot machine]] cannot pay the patron in the typical manner, requiring the casino staff (such as the [[floor attendant]] or cashier) to pay the customer out manually (i.e., by hand).

In casinos which use coin in, coin out systems, a hand pay may be caused by a coin jam, inadequate supply of coins in the machine's hopper to pay the requested amount, or another problem with the coin out mechanism. A hand pay can also be triggered when the win is large enough that the number of coins required to pay out the win would be excessive.

In casinos that use [[ticket in, ticket out]] (cashless) systems, a hand pay can be caused by communication or other issues with the ticket printer. More frequently, it is caused by communication problems with the [[server (computing)|server]] which tracks and assigns ticket serial numbers. 

Hand pays also occur whenever the amount of the win is over the minimum taxable win amount for the jurisdiction that the machine is in. Hand paying allows a floor attendant to collect the patron's identification and tax ID numbers (such as the [[Social Security number]] in the United States), and other pertinent information, such as the winning combination. The patron is then provided with the applicable tax forms. In the [[United States]], a hand pay will normally occur for all wins over $1,200, which is the amount above which winnings must be reported to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]; some states may have lower thresholds where the taxes must be reported to the state revenue office. Citizens of the United States winning in that country will receive a [[W-2G]] tax form, and often a [[W-9]] form to validate that the Social Security number they provided is correct.

To perform a hand pay, a floor attendant may complete a form which the patron presents to the cash cage to be paid out. In other casinos, the floor attendant will retrieve the funds and pay the patron directly. (The latter is typical for hand pays resulting from taxable wins.) Most casinos will require an electronic record of the hand pay to be made through the slot accounting system.

[[File:SAND Maurice Masques et bouffons 01.jpg|thumb|The classical appearance of the Harlequin stock character in the ''commedia dell'arte'' of the 1670s, complete with ''batte'' or "[[slapstick]]", a magic wand used by the character to change the scenery of the play ([[Maurice Sand]], 1860)]]

'''Harlequin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɑr|l|ə|k|w|ɪ|n}}; {{lang-it|Arlecchino}} {{IPA-it|arlekˈkiːno|}}, {{lang-fr|Arlequin}} {{IPA-it|aʁləkɛ̃|}}, [[Old French]] ''Harlequin'') is the best-known of the ''[[zanni]]'' or comic servant characters from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]''. The role is traditionally believed to have been introduced by [[Zan Ganassa]] in the late 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;Duchartre 1929, p. 82; Laurence Senelick in Banham 1995, "Harlequin" p. 472; Rudlin &amp; Crick 2001, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; was definitively popularized by the Italian [[actor]] [[Tristano Martinelli]] in Paris in 1584–1585,&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2008, p. liv, note 32, citing Ferrone, Henke, and Gambelli.&lt;/ref&gt; and became a [[stock character]] after Martinelli's death in 1630.

The Harlequin is characterized by his chequered costume. His role is that of a light-hearted, nimble, and [[Tricky slave|astute servant]], often acting to thwart the plans of his master, and pursuing his own love interest, [[Columbina]], with wit and resourcefulness, often competing with the sterner and melancholic [[Pierrot]]. He later develops into a prototype of the [[romantic hero]]. Harlequin inherits his physical agility and his [[trickster]] qualities, as well as his name,  from a mischievous "[[Devil in Christianity#Middle Ages|devil]]" character in medieval [[passion plays]].

The Harlequin character first appeared in England early in the 17th century and took centre stage in the derived genre of the [[Harlequinade]], developed in the early 18th century by [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]].&lt;ref name="SenelickHarlequin" /&gt; As the Harlequinade portion of English dramatic genre [[pantomime]] developed, Harlequin was routinely paired with the character [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]]. As developed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such in [[Victorian England]] were [[William Payne (pantomimist)|William Payne]] and his sons the [[Payne Brothers]], the latter active during the 1860s and 1870s.

==Origin of the name==
{{further information|Herla|Erlking|Alichino (devil)}}
Although the origins of the Harlequin are obscure there are several theories for how the character came to be. One theory posits that the name is derived from a bird with polychromatic feathers called a ''Harle''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Oreglia 1968, pp. 56–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory suggest that the name Harlequin is taken from that of a mischievous "devil" or "demon" character in popular French [[passion play]]s. It originates with an [[Old French]] term ''herlequin'', ''hellequin'', first attested in the 11th century, by the chronicler [[Orderic Vitalis]], who recounts a story of a monk who was pursued by a troop of demons when wandering on the coast of [[Normandy]] (France ) at night.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ecclesiastical History Book VIII Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;
These demons were led by a masked, club-wielding giant and they were known as ''familia herlequin'' (var. ''familia herlethingi''). This medieval French version of the Germanic [[Wild Hunt]], ''Mesnée d'Hellequin'', has been connected to the English figure of ''[[Herla|Herla cyning]]'' ("host-king"; German [[Erlkönig]]).&lt;ref&gt;Martin Rühlemann, ''Etymologie des wortes harlequin und verwandter wörter'' (1912).
See also Normand R. Cartier, ''Le Bossu désenchanté: Étude sur le Jeu da la Feuillée'', Librairie Droz, 1971,  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=ERF5OUazvTUC&amp;pg=PA132 p. 132].&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hellequin was depicted as a black-faced emissary of the devil, roaming the countryside with a group of demons chasing the damned souls of evil people to Hell. The physical appearance of Hellequin offers an explanation for the traditional colours of Harlequin's red-and-black mask.&lt;ref name=Grantham&gt;Grantham, B., ''Playing Commedia, A Training Guide to Commedia Techniques'', (Nick Hern Books) London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Ghosts in the Middle Ages: The Living and the Dead in Medieval Society | publisher=University Of Chicago Press | author=Jean-Claude Schmitt | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-226-73888-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name's origin could also be traced to a knight from the 9th century, Hellequin of Boulogne, who died fighting the Normans and originated a legend of devils.&lt;ref name="1924-2007. 56"&gt;Oreglia 1968, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantos XXI and XXII from Dante's ''Inferno'' there is a devil by the name of Alichino.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The similarities between the devil in Dante's ''Inferno'' and the Arlecchino are more than cosmetic and that the prank like antics of the devils in the aforementioned antics reflect some carnivalesque aspects.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The first known appearance on stage of Hellequin is dated to 1262, the character of a masked and hooded devil in ''Jeu da la Feuillière'' by [[Adam de la Halle]], and it became  a [[stock character]] in French passion plays.&lt;ref&gt;Lea 1934, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

The re-interpretation of  the "devil" stock character as a [[zanni]] character of the [[commedia dell'arte]]&lt;ref name=Rudlin1994&gt;Rudlin 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; took place in the 16th century in France.
[[Zan Ganassa]], whose troupe is first mentioned in [[Mantua]] in the late 1560s, is one of the earliest known actors suggested to have performed the part,&lt;ref name=SenelickHarlequin&gt;Laurence Senelick in Banham 1995, "Harlequin" p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt; although there is "little hard evidence to support [it]."&lt;ref&gt;Rudlin &amp; Crick 2001, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Ganassa performed in France in 1571, and if he did play the part there, he left the field open for another actor to take up the role, when he took his troupe to Spain permanently in 1574.&lt;ref&gt;Rudlin &amp; Crick 2001, pp. 7–13. These authors speculate that Ganassa may have dropped the role in Spain, since apparently he gained too much weight to perform the required acrobatics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest depictions of the character are a 1570-1571 Flemish painting in the Museum of [[Bayeux]]&lt;ref name=SterlingDuchartre/&gt;&lt;ref name=KatritzkyBayeux/&gt; and several woodblock prints probably dating from the 1580s in the Fossard collection, discovered by Agne Beijer in the 1920s among uncatalogued items in the [[Nationalmuseum Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;Katritzky 2006, pp. 107–108; Beijer &amp; Duchartre 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Compositions de rhétorique de Mr. Don Arlequin, 1601, p01 (title page Arlechin) - Gallica 2010 (adjusted).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tristano Martinelli]]'s Harlequin costume as depicted in his ''Compositions de rhétorique'', 1601]]

[[Tristano Martinelli]] is the first actor definitely known to have used the name 'Harlequin' (or 'Arlequin') for the ''secondo zanni'' role, and he probably first performed the part in France in (or just before) 1584 and only later brought the character to Italy, where he became known as Arlecchino.&lt;ref&gt;Lea 1934, pp. 79–84; Katritzky 2006, pp. 102–104; Andrews 2008, pp. xxvi–xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; The motley costume is sometimes attributed to Martinelli, who wore a linen costume of colourful patches, and a hare-tail on his cap to indicate cowardice.  Martinelli's Harlequin also had a black leather [[domino mask|half-mask]], a moustache and a pointed beard. 
He was very successful, even playing at court and becoming a favourite of [[Henry IV of France]], to whom he addressed insolent monologues (''Compositions de Rhetorique de Mr. Don Arlequin'', 1601).&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Charney (ed.), ''Comedy: A Geographic and Historical Guide'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=Og4ntxFQP2cC&amp;pg=PA239 p. 239].&lt;/ref&gt;
Martinelli's great success contributed to the perpetuation of his interpretation of the zanni role, along with the name of his character, after his death in 1630, among others, by  [[Nicolò Zecca]], active c. 1630 in [[Bologna]] as well as [[Turin]] and Mantua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boni |first=Filippo de' |year=1852| title=Biografia degli artisti ovvero dizionario della vita e delle opere dei pittori, degli scultori, degli intagliatori, dei tipografi e dei musici di ogni nazione che fiorirono da'tempi più remoti sino á nostri giorni.

The character was also performed in Paris at the [[Comédie-Italienne]] in Italian by [[Giovan Battista Andreini]] and [[Angelo Costantini]] (c. 1654–1729) and in French as ''Arlequin'' in the 1660s by {{Interlanguage link multi|Dominique Biancolelli|it|vertical-align=sup}} (1636–1688), who combined the zanni types, "making his Arlecchino witty, neat, and fluent in a croaking voice, which became as traditional as the squawk of [[Pulcinella|Punch]]."&lt;ref name=SenelickHarlequin/&gt; 
The Italians were expelled from France in 1697 for satirizing [[King Louis XIV]]'s second wife, [[Madame de Maintenon]],&lt;ref&gt;Donald Roy in Banham 1995, "Comédie-Italienne" pp. 233–234.&lt;/ref&gt; but returned in 1716 (after his death), when [[Tommaso Antonio Vicentini]] ("Thomassin", 1682–1739) became famous in the part.&lt;ref name=Rudlin1994/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Senelick in Banham 1995, "Vicentini" p. 867.&lt;/ref&gt; The rhombus shape of the patches arose by adaptation to the Paris fashion of the 17th century by   Biancolelli.

==Characteristics and dramatic function==
[[File:Tivoli Gardens - Harlequin.jpg|thumb|upright|Harlequin at the [[Pantomimeteatret|Pantomime Theatre]] in [[Tivoli Gardens]] in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark ]]

=== Physicality ===
The primary aspect of Arlecchino was his physical agility.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grantham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudlin1994" /&gt; He was very nimble and performed the sort of acrobatics the audience expected to see. The character would never perform a simple action when the addition of a [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheel]], somersault, or [[flip (acrobatic)|flip]] would spice up the movement.&lt;ref name="1924-2007. 56"/&gt;
{{quote|By contrast with the 'first ''zanni'''  Harlequin takes little or no part in the development of the plot. he has the more arduous task of maintaining the even rhythm of the comedy as a whole. He is therefore always on the go, very agile and more acrobatic than any of the other Masks|Oreglia, Giacomo&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;}}
Early characteristics of Arlecchino paint the character as a second zanni servant from northern Italy with the paradoxical attributes of a dimwitted fool and an intelligent trickster.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Arlecchino is sometimes referred to as putting on a show of stupidity in a metatheatrical attempt to create chaos within the play.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scuderi|first=Antonio|year=2000|title=Arlecchino Revisited: Tracing the Demon from the Carnival to Kramer and Mr. Bean.|url=|journal=Theatre History Studies|volume=20|pages=143–155|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, Arlecchino is described as wearing a costume covered in irregular patches, a hat outfitted with either a rabbit or fox's tail, and a red and black mask.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The mask itself is identified by carbuncles on the forehead, small eyes, a snub nose, hollow cheeks, and sometimes bushy brows with facial hair.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Arlecchino is  often depicted as having a wooden sword hanging from a leather belt on his person.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Aside from his acrobatics, Arlecchino is also known for having several specific traits such as: 
* Appearing humpbacked without artificial padding
* The ability to eat large amounts of food quickly
* Using his wooden sword like a fan
* A parody of ''[[bel canto]]''
and several other techniques.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Speech ===
One of the major distinctions of ''commedia dell'arte'' is the use of regional dialects.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Arlecchino's speech evolved with the character. Originally speaking in a Bergamo dialect, the character adopted a mixture of French and Italian dialects when the character became more of fixture in France so as to help the performers to connect to the common masses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Dramatic function ===
Various troupes and actors would alter his behaviour to suit style, personal preferences, or even the particular [[scenario]] being performed. He is typically cast as the servant of an ''[[innamorato]]'' or ''[[vecchio]]'' much to the detriment of the plans of his master. Arlecchino often had a love interest in the person of [[Columbina]], or in older plays any of the [[Soubrette]] roles, and his lust for her was only superseded by his desire for food and fear of his master. Occasionally, Arlecchino would pursue the innamorata, though rarely with success, as in the ''Recueil Fossard'' of the 16th century where he is shown trying to woo Donna Lucia for himself by masquerading as a foreign nobleman. He also is known to try to win any given lady for himself if he chances upon anyone else trying to woo her, by interrupting or ridiculing the new competitor. His sexual appetite is essentially immediate, and can be applied to any passing woman.&lt;ref&gt;Rudlin 1994, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Anchor|Truffaldino|Guazetto|Zaccagnino|Bagatino}}

Between the 16th and 17th centuries Arlecchino gained some function as a politically aware character. In the ''Comèdie itlaienne'' Arlecchino would parodie French tragedies as well comment on current events.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Variants ==
[[File:Cezanne Harlequin.JPG|thumb|upright|''Harlequin'', 1888–1890, [[Paul Cézanne]]]]
Duchartre lists the following as variations on the Harlequin role:

'''[[Trivelino]]''' or '''Trivelin.''' Name is said to mean "Tatterdemalion." One of the oldest versions of Harlequin, dating to the 15th century. Costume almost identical to Harlequin's, but had a variation of the 17th century where the triangular patches were replaced with moons, stars, circles and triangles.  In 18th century [[France]], Trivelino was a distinct character from Harlequin.  They appeared together in a number of comedies by [[Pierre de Marivaux]] including [[L'Île des esclaves]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Oreglia 1968, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Truffa, Truffaldin or Truffaldino.''' Popular characters with Gozzi and Goldoni, but said to be best when used for improvisations. By the 18th century was a Bergamask caricature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Guazzetto.''' In the seventeenth century, a variety of anonymous engravings show Guazzetto rollicking, similar to Arlechino. He wears a fox's brush, a large three-tiered collarette, wide breeches, and a loose jacket tied tightly by a belt. He also dons a neckerchief dropped over the shoulders like a small cape. Guazzetto's mask is characterized with a hooked nose and a mustache. His bat is shaped like a scimitar-esque sword.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duchartre 1929, pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zaccagnino.''' Character dating to the 15th century.

'''Bagatino.''' A juggler.

'''Pedrolino or Pierotto'''. A servant or valet clad in mostly white, created by Giovanni Pellesini.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==English harlequinade and pantomime==
The Harlequin character came to England early in the 17th century and took center stage in the derived genre of the [[Harlequinade]], developed in the early 18th century by the Lincoln's Fields Theatre's actor-manager [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]], who played the role under the name of Lun.&lt;ref name=SenelickHarlequin/&gt; As the Harlequinade portion of English [[pantomime]] developed, Harlequin was routinely paired with the character [[Harlequinade#clown|Clown]].

Two developments in 1800, both involving [[Joseph Grimaldi]], greatly changed the pantomime characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harlequin in His Element|last=Mayer III|first=David|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1969|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grimaldi starred as Clown in [[Charles Dibdin the younger|Charles Dibdin's]] 1800 pantomime, ''Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World'' at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Neville, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkins&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 95–100&lt;/ref&gt; For this elaborate production, Dibdin introduced new costume designs. Clown's costume was "garishly colourful ... patterned with large diamonds and circles, and fringed with tassels and ruffs," instead of the tatty servant's outfit that had been used for a century. The production was a hit, and the new costume design was copied by others in London.&lt;ref name=Wilkins/&gt; Later the same year, at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], in ''Harlequin Amulet; or, The Magick of Mona.'' Harlequin was modified to become "romantic and mercurial, instead of mischievous", leaving Grimaldi's mischievous and brutish Clown as the "undisputed agent" of chaos, and the foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who retained stylized dance poses.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell Stott, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential such pair in [[Victorian England]] were the [[Payne Brothers]], active during the 1860s and 1870s, who contributed to 20th-century "slapstick" comedy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2210">[[Image:Dance_floor_2_by_harmon.jpg|thumb|Illuminated dancefloor]]
An '''illuminated dance floor''', '''LED dance floor''' or '''disco dance floor''' is a floor with panels or tiles that light up with different colours. They are used for dance. They were popularised for [[disco]] by the 1977 film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' which had gotten its inspiration from a floor that director [[John Badham]] had seen at "The Club", a private supper club in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]].

Early illuminated floors date back to the 1920s, one of the first being built at the Via Lago Café in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Via Lago, Closed Few Years, Reopens in Chicago." Billboard 10 June 1944: 21. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt;  They consisted of translucent coloured glass panels lit from below by bulbs.

Modern illuminated floors are lit using coloured [[LED]]s. Usually [[RGB color model|red, green and blue]] LEDs are used to get a wide colour range. The floors are typically constructed of solid sided square cells and tiled with a [[toughened glass]], [[acrylic glass]] or [[Lexan]] top. The sides and bottoms are made reflective and the top diffuses the light to give an even colour.

The floor can display different patterns and flash under computer control. A row or square matrix of panels share a control module.&lt;ref&gt;[http://washufloor.blogspot.com/ Washington University IEEE Dance Floor Project]&lt;/ref&gt;  The control modules are typically connected to the computer via [[USB]] cables. [[USB hub]]s handle fan-out to a number of control modules and extend the distance that can be reached. In future, cabling and control will be simplified by connecting the control modules to each other. 

The tiles may also have [[pressure sensor]]s as for a [[dance mat]] so the pattern displayed or the music or other effects depend on the dancers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/storborg/ddf/downloads.html MIT: The First East Disco Dance Floor] Documentation downloads&lt;/ref&gt;

These floors are not designed to conform to any [[:wikt:dance floor|dance floor]] standards, because they are not [[sprung floor]]s.

"'''Leck mich im Arsch'''" is a song by [[Insane Clown Posse]] and [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]]. The lyrics are inspired by [[Leck mich im Arsch]], a [[Mozart and scatology|scatological]] [[Canon (music)|canon]] by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (K. 231/382c), while the music is based on a canon called [[Leck mir den Arsch fein recht schön sauber]] (K. 233/382d). The latter has for two centuries been attributed to Mozart but evidence has shown that the music of the piece was composed by [[Wenzel Trnka]] and Mozart merely replaced the original lyrics with his own.

==Background==
In August 2011, Insane Clown Posse was contacted by [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]], who invited [[Violent J|Joseph Bruce]] and [[Shaggy 2 Dope|Joseph Utsler]] to his [[mansion]], because he wanted to collaborate with them.&lt;ref name=mtv-white&gt;{{cite web|author=09/01/2011 19:53:25 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1670126/insane-clown-posse-jack-white-lech-mich-im-arsch.jhtml?fb_ref=share_fblike&amp;fb_source=profile_oneline |title=Insane Clown Posse 'Hella Thankful' For Jack White Collabo - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=2011-09-01 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=villagevoice-white&gt;{{cite web |last=Dodero |first=Camille |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2011/09/insane_clown_posse_talks_jack_white.php |title=Q&amp;A: Violent J Talks Jack White, "Lick Me in the Arse," And Why He Doesn't Think Insane Clown Posse Is Really Getting a Better Public Reception These Days - New York - Music - Sound of the City |publisher=Blogs.villagevoice.com |date=2011-09-01 |accessdate=2012-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929235427/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2011/09/insane_clown_posse_talks_jack_white.php |archivedate=2012-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; White played the track he was working on, an arrangement of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s "Leck mich im Arsch" with live instrumentation by [[JEFF the Brotherhood]], for Bruce and Utsler and explained that the title of the track translated to "Lick My Ass".&lt;ref name=mtv-white/&gt;&lt;ref name=villagevoice-white/&gt;

Insane Clown Posse were surprised that White wanted to work with them, and said that they had respect for White, who is also from [[Detroit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilp4eIXt9C0 |title=ICP Interviewed About Jack White Collaboration |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Violent J]] said, "The most respected musician in the world and one of the most hated musicians in the world. We didn't expect that call, brother. I told him, 'I gotta know—why us?'. He said, 'I find myself going to your web site and looking at it. Some stuff I think is genius, some stuff I don't understand at all, but I always find myself going back there and seeing what you're up to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-white-stripes/58987 |title=Jack White opens up about Insane Clown Posse collaboration &amp;#124; News |publisher=Nme.Com |date=2011-09-02 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Song information==
Bruce perceived that the scatological nature of the composition was the reason why White asked Bruce and Utsler to appear on the song, but once White explained Mozart's sense of humor, they became excited to work on it. Insane Clown Posse went back to their hotel room to write their lyrics, and returned to record with White and JEFF the Brotherhood in White's home recording studio.&lt;ref name=mtv-white/&gt;&lt;ref name=villagevoice-white/&gt; Bruce and Utsler's vocals were recorded in one take.&lt;ref name=villagevoice-white/&gt; Insane Clown Posse said that the song was a collaboration and that White asked them for their feedback throughout the recording process. The song was released as a single on September 13, 2011 by White's label [[Third Man Records]].&lt;ref name=mtv-white/&gt;&lt;ref name=villagevoice-white/&gt;&lt;ref name=mozart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/467653/jack-white-insane-clown-posse-mozart-arse-single-listen |title=Jack White + Insane Clown Posse + Mozart = 'Arse' Single: Listen |publisher=Billboard.com |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WrestleMania]] is a [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] event produced by the [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE), formerly known as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), and is considered the [[flagship]] event of the company. 

The events feature [[List of World Wrestling Entertainment employees|wrestlers]] from the promotion's roster competing in a variety of [[professional wrestling matches]] (with predetermined outcomes, though portrayed as legitimate). The WrestleMania franchise debuted in 1985 with [[WrestleMania I]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm1/factsstats/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051021042204/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm1/factsstats/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-10-21 |title=WrestleMania History: WrestleMania I |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |accessdate=2008-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been produced annually since then. [[WrestleMania 34]] is the most recent production.

Aside from professional wrestling performances, celebrities have been a major key in the production of WrestleMania events. WWE involves them to attract more hype and media attention for the event, in an effort to boost pay-per-view buys, and ticket sales.&lt;ref name="Celeblist1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestling.about.com/od/wrestlemania/a/wmcelebrities.htm|title=WrestleMania Celebrities|last=Cohen|first=Eric|publisher=About.com (Professional Wrestling)|accessdate=2008-08-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129152231/http://prowrestling.about.com/od/wrestlemania/a/wmcelebrities.htm|archivedate=2009-01-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelguidemag.com/articles/wrestleCelebs.lasso|title=WrestleMania Celebrity Sightings|last=Acklen|first=Lori|publisher=Channel Guide Magazine|accessdate=2008-08-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080606002133/http://www.channelguidemag.com/articles/wrestleCelebs.lasso &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrities involved with WrestleMania events have come from a range of occupations, including [[singing]], [[acting]], [[sports]], and [[Model (person)|modeling]], and have been used in a variety of roles, such as live musical performances, backstage segments, ringside managers, and on some occasions even as wrestlers.

Overall, there have been 99 celebrities involved at WrestleMania: 32 athletes, 29 musicians, 19 actors, and 20 from various other backgrounds.  Nine of these celebrities would subsequently be inducted into the celebrity wing of the [[WWE Hall of Fame]].

'''''Magic to Win''''' (Chinese: 開心魔法, meaning "Happy Magic") is a 2011 Hong Kong film directed by [[Wilson Yip]]. The film stars [[Wu Chun]], [[Karena Ng]], [[Raymond Wong (film presenter)|Raymond Wong]], [[Wu Jing (actor)|Wu Jing]] and [[Louis Koo]]. It is a sixth installment of the ''Happy Ghost'' film franchise, but a completely different version of the story.

==Plot==
The world consists of five elements: gold, wood, water, fire and earth. In the wizard world of "Magic to Win", the story also revolves around the "Five Element Wizardry", portraying a story that surpasses our imagination. Kang Sengui (Raymond Wong), a university professor, is the Water Magician of "Five Elements Wizardry". Although he uses magic spells in his daily life, his superpower remains a secret. By accident, his power is transmitted to his student, Macy (Karena), who recklessly uses her newfound powers for personal gain and money-making. When she encounters Ling Feng, the spirit of an amnesiac Earth Magician, slowly begins to realize there is more to magic than just profit. Meanwhile, Bi Yewu, a Fire Magician, sets out on a mission to capture the elemental magicians in order to open a rift in time in an attempt to change history and save his parents who perished in a fire in his youth. His search leads him to Ling Feng, Wood Magician Gu Xinyue, Metal Magician Charlie and finally Macy. The rift eventually opens and the world is put on the moment of doom.

==Cast==
*[[Wu Chun]] as Ling Feng: Earth Magician. He lost his memory and powers and body after losing a battle to the Fire Magician.

'''''One Night in Supermarket''''' is a 2009 Chinese [[comedy film]] directed and written by Yang Qing, starring [[Xu Zheng (actor)|Xu Zheng]], [[Li Xiaolu]], [[Qiao Renliang]], Yang Qing (not the director), Zhang Jiayi, Zhao Yingjun and Wang Dongfang. The low-budget movie, Yang's [[directorial debut]], was filmed over 29 days in basically one location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Qiao Yi|url=http://news.alibaba.com/article/detail/business-in-china/100154044-1-yang-qing%253A-young-voice-finds.html|title=Yang Qing: Young voice finds cinema success|date=2009-08-12|newspaper=[[Global Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story begins when a jobless man (Xu) and his doofus cousin (Wang) hold hostage the young employees (Li and Qiao) at a 24-hour supermarket, because the mart owner (Yang) had denied his lottery win. Hilarity ensues when a moronic prankster (Zhao), a myriad of shoppers, the mean owner and an at-large gunman (Zhang) enter the mart one after another.

==Plot==
Bespectacled nerd Li Junwei ([[Qiao Renliang]]) and pretty girl Tang Xiaolian ([[Li Xiaolu]]) are manning the night shift at the 24-hour Wang Wang Supermarket when balding lottery addict He Sanshui ([[Xu Zheng (actor)|Xu Zheng]]) arrives, demanding to speak to the lady owner Wang Sufen (Yang Qing). Wang, who is not in, made a typo entering the lottery number more than a month ago, which rendered He Sanshui's winning ticket useless. When He Sanshui asked for the ¥9500 win at an earlier occasion, she attacked him and drove him out of her store. This time, He Sanshui returns with a stun gun flashlight and his dimwitted cousin He Damiao a.k.a. Tire (Wang Dongfang), and is determined to get his ¥9500 "back". 

At this moment, Li's goofy roommate Zhu Liao (Zhao Yingjun) who wants to record a funny prank video also storms in, wearing a pantyhose on his face and wielding a knife, but is quickly tasered down by He Sanshui. He Sanshui proceeds to the cashier counter and realizes there isn't enough cash in the cash register. He and Tire rope up everyone else in the soundproof back room—which has a complete Karaoke system—and taking their place behind the register begin to run the store, funneling the profits into their own pockets. 

The hungry Tire is getting preoccupied with bag after bag of junk food (some of which have expired) and Karaoke singing in the back, so Li—whom He Sanshui calls "Little Steel Teeth" because he wears a dental brace—is brought back out to help with the work. Some time later, Tang's escape attempt, during which she tasers down Tire, is spoiled by Zhu's foolishness and He Sanshui's second stun gun. 

Wang suddenly returns to the store from her [[Mahjong]] games—obvious having lost all her money—and immediately begins to attack He Sanshui with a bag of weight before Tire tasers her down. However, holding her (and her [[French Bulldog]] Wang Wang) hostage does nothing to the business, which has been slow tonight. In an effort to boost sales He Sanshui decides to give 50% discount to all store items, and business quickly perks up after a taxicab chauffeur (Cao Li) helps spread the news to his colleagues. During this time, Tang discovers voyeuristic photos of hers in Li's phone and realizes that Li likes her.

With ¥3.50 to go before their ¥9500 goal (taking into account that Tire has eaten ¥118.10 of food), a [[Guanzhong dialect]]-speaking, gun-toting robber (Zhang Jiayi) on the run arrives to retrieve a diamond his partner left in the ice in the store freezer. Unable to find his diamond he takes everyone hostage and is in the middle of having everyone strip, when Yaozi (Ye Qian)—the store's delivery man who has fallen asleep in the warehouse—barges out from the rear. The group tries to subdue the gunman, but fails because He Sanshui's stun gun has run out of battery. 

When the diamond is finally discovered during the subsequent search, the dog Wang Wang picks it up and runs outside. This is when the gunman realizes that the police have already surrounded the store: it was Tang who secretly texted a policeman shopper (Li Weijian). The gunman runs back inside, grabs Tang and points his gun to her head. Li saves Tang but is shot by the gunman, who is accidentally electrocuted by a loose wire.  

Some time later, the policeman returns to the store and learns that Li—no longer wearing a brace and glasses—and Tang have been dating, while He Sanshui and Wang are honeymooning in [[Hainan]]. They watch on TV that Zhu has become a famous actor, and Tire his agent.

The history of '''[[opera]] in the English language''' commences in the 17th century.

==Earliest examples==
In England, one of opera's antecedents in the 16th century was an [[afterpiece]] which came at the end of a play; often scandalous and consisting in the main of dialogue set to music arranged from popular tunes.  In this respect such afterpieces anticipate the [[ballad opera]]s of the 18th century.  At the same time, the French [[masque]] was gaining a firm hold at the English Court, with lavish splendour and highly realistic scenery. [[Inigo Jones]] became the leading designer of these productions, and this style was to dominate the English stage for three centuries.  These masques contained songs and dances. In [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''Lovers Made Men'' (1617), "the whole masque was sung after the Italian manner, stilo recitativo".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley W. Wells, ''Literature and drama with special references to Shakespeare and his contemporaries'' (London: Routledge, 1970), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purcell and his contemporaries==
[[Image:Henry Purcell.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry Purcell]]]]The approach of the [[English Commonwealth]] closed theatres and halted any developments that may have led to the establishment of English opera.  However, in 1656, the [[dramatist]] Sir [[William Davenant]] produced ''[[The Siege of Rhodes]]''.  Since his theatre was not licensed to produce drama, he asked several of the leading composers ([[Henry Lawes]], Cooke, Locke, Coleman and Hudson) to set sections of it to music.  This success was followed by ''The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru'' (1658) and ''The History of Sir Francis Drake'' (1659).  These pieces were encouraged by [[Oliver Cromwell]] because they were critical of Spain.  With the [[English Restoration]], foreign (especially French) musicians were welcomed back. In 1673, [[Thomas Shadwell]]'s ''Psyche'', patterned on the 1671 'comédie-ballet' of the same name produced by [[Molière]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]].  [[William Davenant]] produced ''The Tempest'' in the same year, which was the first [[Shakespeare]] play to be set to music (composed by Locke and Johnson).
[[Image:Blow, John, Huyot after White, BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Blow]]]]
About 1683, [[John Blow]] composed ''[[Venus and Adonis (opera)|Venus and Adonis]]'', often thought of as the first true English-language opera.  Blow's immediate successor was the better known [[Henry Purcell]].  Despite the success of his masterwork ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' (1689), in which the action is furthered by the use of Italian-style recitative, much of Purcell's best work was not involved in the composing of typical opera, but instead he usually worked within the constraints of the [[semi-opera]] format, where isolated scenes and masques are contained within the structure of a spoken play, such as [[Shakespeare]] in Purcell's ''[[The Fairy-Queen]]'' (1692) and [[Beaumont and Fletcher]] in ''The Prophetess'' (1690) and ''Bonduca'' (1696).  The main characters of the play tend not to be involved in the musical scenes, which means that Purcell was rarely able to develop his characters through song.  Despite these hindrances, his aim (and that of his collaborator [[John Dryden]]) was to establish serious opera in England, but these hopes ended with Purcell's early death at the age of 36.

==18th and 19th centuries==
[[Image:Thomas Augustine Arne.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Arne]]]]
Following Purcell, the popularity of opera in England dwindled. A revived interest in opera occurred in the 1730s, which is largely attributed to [[Thomas Arne]] both for his own compositions and for alerting Handel to the commercial possibilities of large-scale works in English. Arne was the first English composer to experiment with Italian-style all-sung comic opera, unsuccessfully in ''The Temple of Dullness'' (1745), ''Henry and Emma'' (1749) and ''Don Saverio'' (1750), but triumphantly in ''[[Thomas and Sally]]'' (1760). His opera ''[[Artaxerxes (opera)|Artaxerxes]]'' (1762) was the first attempt to set a full-blown [[opera seria]] in English and was a huge success, holding the stage until the 1830s. His modernized ballad opera, ''[[Love in a Village]]'' (1762), was equally novel and began a vogue for pastiche opera that lasted well into the 19th century. Arne was one of the few English composers of the era who, although imitating many elements of Italian opera, was able to move beyond it to create his own voice. [[Charles Burney]] wrote that Arne introduced "a light, airy, original, and pleasing melody, wholly different from that of Purcell or Handel, whom all English composers had either pillaged or imitated".

Besides Arne, the other dominating force in English opera at this time was [[George Frideric Handel]], whose ''opera serias'' filled the London operatic stages for decades, and influenced most home-grown composers such as [[John Frederick Lampe]] to write using Italian models in imitation of him.

This situation continued throughout the late 18th century and the 19th, with composers being influenced mainly by Italian opera in the manner of Rossini and his successors, [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]'s [[grand opera]]s and later by [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]].

Another short period of intense creativity from English composers came in the years going roughly from the 1830s to the 1850s.
The Romantic operas of [[Michael Balfe]] (the only one whose fame spread throughout Europe&lt;ref&gt;BURTON, Nigel (with IAN D. HALLIGAN), "Balfe, Michael William", in Sadie, Stanley, ed. (1998). The New Grove Dictionary of Opera. New York: Grove's Dictionaries of Music Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Julius Benedict]], [[John Barnett]], [[Edward Loder]], [[George Alexander Macfarren|G. A. Macfarren]] and [[William Vincent Wallace|William Wallace]] achieved great popularity both in Great Britain and Ireland.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:Maritanacigarbox.jpg|thumb|left|Cigar box from 1883 showing a scene from [[Maritana]] by [[William Vincent Wallace|Wallace]]]]
[[John Barnett]] made a serious attempt to follow in the footsteps of [[Carl Maria von Weber]] with his opera ''[[The Mountain Sylph]]'' (1834), often mistakenly claimed as the first [[through-sung|Sung-through]] (i.e. completely sung) English opera, which was his only major success (and was later parodied by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] in ''[[Iolanthe]]'').&lt;br /&gt;
Among the main lanes in London for the production of English language opera in those times were [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]], the [[Princess's Theatre, London|Princess's Theatre]] and the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;E. W. White, ''A history of English Opera'', Faber and Faber (1983) p. 261-294&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]] and the [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], which were the two major opera houses of the city, featured mostly Italian and French opera (the latter usually translated into Italian). This was a source of continuous vexation for English composers who, until late in the century, had to see their works translated into Italian to be performed on those stages.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;
[[Image:Sir Julius Benedict Vanity Fair 27 September 1873.jpg|thumb|left|[[Julius Benedict|Benedict]] in a caricature by [[Leslie Ward]] from [[Vanity Fair (UK)|Vanity Fair]] (1873)]]
Moreover, the constant presence of a foreign language opera season in the city meant that the operas of indigenous composers had constantly to compete with those of the great Italian composers, as well as those of [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], [[Meyerbeer]], [[Fromental Halévy]] and [[Gounod]] (the last three usually performed in Italian at the Covent Garden), which continued to dominate the musical stage in England. Beside Balfe, whose operas were translated into German, French and Italian (''The Bohemian Girl'' as ''La Zingara'', for Trieste), the only other composers to gain so renown on the Continent and to have their operas translated into a foreign language were Benedict (into his native German) and Wallace (also in German).&lt;ref&gt;E. W. White, ''A history of English Opera'', Faber and Faber (1983) p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Glad to See You Together.png|thumb|right|''from left to right'': the Savoy impresario [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] with [[W. S. Gilbert]], and [[Arthur Sullivan]] in a drawing by [[Alfred Bryan (illustrator)|Alfred Bryan]], 1894]]
After the 1870s, the reputation of English Romantic Opera slowly started to decline until, by the end of the century, most critics' opinion was against them. The only works to be still performed well into the 1930s were ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]'', ''[[Maritana]]'' and ''[[The Lily of Killarney]]''.&lt;ref&gt;E. W. White, ''A history of English Opera'', Faber and Faber (1983) p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

Beside foreign opera and European operetta, the most popular forms of indigenous entertainment in the second half of the 19th century were [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and late [[Victorian era]] [[light opera]]s, notably the [[Savoy Operas]] of [[W. S. Gilbert|Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan|Sullivan]], both of which frequently spoofed operatic conventions.

Sullivan wrote only one grand opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (following the efforts of a number of young English composers beginning about 1876), but he claimed that even his [[Savoy opera|light operas]] were to be part of an "English" opera school, intended to supplant the French operettas (usually in bad translations) that had dominated the London stage throughout the 19th century into the 1870s. London's ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' agreed. Sullivan produced a few light operas in the late 1880s and 1890s that were of a more serious nature than most of the G&amp;S series, including ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]'' and ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'', but ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (which ran for 155 consecutive performances, using alternating casts—a record then and now) survives as his only real [[grand opera]].

Late in the century composers such as [[Isidore de Lara]], [[Frederick Delius|Delius]] and [[Dame Ethel Smyth]], owing to the difficulties of getting serious English operas staged at home, caused in part by the popularity of light opera, turned to the Continent to seek their fortune, with De Lara becoming very popular in France and in Italy (his opera [[Messaline]] being the first work by an Englishman to be produced at [[La Scala]]).&lt;ref&gt;E. W. White, ''A history of English Opera'', Faber and Faber (1983) p. 341-346&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century - today==
In the 20th century, English opera began to assert more independence, with works of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and [[Rutland Boughton]] and later [[Benjamin Britten]], who, in a series of fine works that remain in standard repertory today, revealed an excellent flair for the dramatic and superb musicality. &lt;br /&gt;
Nevertheless, foreign influence (now coming mainly from [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] and [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]]), was still strong. One example is [[Joseph Holbrooke|Josef Holbrooke]]'s ''The Cauldron of Annwn'' trilogy. The influence of Wagner's ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' can be seen in the choice of a mythological subject and also in the extensive use of ''[[leitmotif|leitmotivs]]'', while harmony and orchestration are more reminiscent of Strauss.&lt;ref&gt;Bayliss, Stanley: Josef Holbrooke (Musical Mirror) reprinted in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, p.106)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Other British composers writing well-received operas in the late 20th century include [[Richard Rodney Bennett]] (e.g. ''The Mines of Sulphur''), [[Harrison Birtwistle]] (''[[Punch and Judy (opera)|Punch and Judy]]''), [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] (''[[Taverner (opera)|Taverner]]'') and [[Oliver Knussen]] (''[[Where the Wild Things Are (opera)|Where the Wild Things Are]]''). Today composers such as [[Thomas Adès]] continue to export English opera abroad.

Also in the 20th century, American composers like [[George Gershwin]] (''[[Porgy and Bess]]''), [[Gian Carlo Menotti]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], and [[Carlisle Floyd]] began to contribute English-language operas, frequently infused with touches of popular musical styles.  They were followed by [[Philip Glass]] (''[[Einstein on the Beach]]''), [[Mark Adamo]], [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] (''[[Nixon in China]]''), and [[Jake Heggie]]. Moreover, non-native-English speaking composers have occasionally set English libretti (e.g. [[Igor Stravinsky]], ''[[The Rake's Progress]]''; [[Hans Werner Henze]], ''[[We Come to the River]]'').

Official data for Vitebsk, Minsk, Grodno and Mogilev provinces in 1889 showed there were 50 brothels with 326 [[prostitute]]s working in them.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sipb.pl.tl/%26%231041%3B%26%231083%3B%26%231091%3B%26%231076%3B-%26%231087%3B%26%231103%3B%26%231085%3B%26%231077%3B%26%231078%3B%26%231085%3B%26%231099%3B--k1-%26%231087%3B%26%231088%3B%26%231072%3B%26%231089%3B%26%231090%3B%26%231099%3B%26%231090%3B%26%231091%3B%26%231094%3B%26%231099%3B%26%231103%3B-k2-.htm |title=Блуд пянежны (прастытуцыя) |website=Sipb.pl.tl |date= |accessdate=2017-05-29|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1897 [[Russia]]n [[census]] of the 5 Belarus provinces recorded 479 prostitutes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

According to Ministry of Internal Affairs official 2010 figures, there were 1,930&lt;ref name="nn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nn.by/?c=ar&amp;i=50863 |title=Прастытуцыя ў Беларусі робіцца і мужчынскім заняткам |website=Nn.by |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2017-05-29|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; women involved in prostitution in Belarus, roughly 637&lt;ref name="nn" /&gt; of them were in [[Minsk]]. 780 people were prosecuted for prostitution in 210.&lt;ref name="nn" /&gt;

==Sex tourism==
The country is a destination for [[sex tourism]].&lt;ref name="belarusdigest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="minskherald" /&gt; The government has tried to combat this by visa restrictions. However there are no visas required for visitors from Russia, where most of the sex tourists come from.&lt;ref name="belarusdigest" /&gt; Most tourists travel to the country independently, but there are "sex tours" organised from [[Turkey]] and [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="belarusdigest" /&gt;

Russian are attracted to [[casino]]s in the country,&lt;ref name="belarusdigest" /&gt; (Russia banned gambling and shut all casinos in 2009)&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Antonov|first1=Mikhail|last2=Bomko|first2=Vladimir|title=Russia bans all gambling and shuts casinos|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gambling-closure-odd/russia-bans-all-gambling-and-shuts-casinos-idUSTRE56045Y20090701|website=Reuters|accessdate=1 February 2018|date=1 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prostitution is attached to many of the casinos.&lt;ref name="belarusdigest" /&gt; There have been a number of high-profile arrests in connection with prostitution in casinos. In 2012, the art director and manager of Minsk's Dankoff Club were arrested and later the owner of the club, Jury Dańkoŭ, was also arrested.&lt;ref name="belarusdigest2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smok|first1=Vadzim|title=Minsk Police Cracks Down On Prostitution in Elite Clubs|url=https://belarusdigest.com/story/minsk-police-cracks-down-on-prostitution-in-elite-clubs/|website=BelarusDigest|accessdate=1 February 2018|date=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a Turkish citizen resident in Belarus permit was jailed 7 years for organising sex tours from Turkey. A year later an accomplice was also sentenced to 7 years. Some [[Middle East]] nationals have also been deported from Belarus for similar activities.&lt;ref name="minskherald"&gt;{{cite web|title="Can't buy me love!"

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Belarus}}
Belarus is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Belarusian victims are primarily subjected to trafficking in Russia and Belarus, as well as in [[Poland]], Turkey, and other countries in [[Eurasia]] and the Middle East. Some Belarusian women travelling for foreign employment in the adult entertainment and hotel industries are subjected to sex trafficking. The government has identified Belarusian, [[Moldova]]n, Russian, [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], and [[Vietnam]]ese victims exploited in Belarus.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Belarus 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271144.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=1 February 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 181 of the criminal code prohibits both sex and labour trafficking and prescribes penalties ranging from five to 15 years imprisonment in addition to the forfeiture of offenders’ assets.  The government reported one sex trafficking investigation in 2016 under article 181, compared with one in 2015, one in 2014, and six in 2013.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Belarus as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 3]]' country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4135">A '''pub church''' is a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Local church|Church]] which meets in a [[public house]] or similar establishment. Their purpose is to exist as an authentic Christian community, but in a way which is both provocative and accessible to un-churched people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thornton|first=Phil|title=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/house-and-home/property/pub-closures-the-spirit-of-change-862640.html|accessdate=9 July 2008|location=London|date=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton recognises that the closure of public houses has diminished community space, and this is an attempt to restore this community asset.

As Archbishop [[Rowan Williams]] has commented:{{cquote|
"If 'church' is what happens when people encounter the Risen Jesus and commit themselves to sustaining and deepening that encounter in their encounter with each other, there is plenty of theological room for diversity of rhythm and style, so long as we have ways of identifying the same living Christ at the heart of every expression of Christian life in common.&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Williams ''Mission Shaped Church'' (Church House Publishing, 2004) Forward&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This can take a number of forms. Sometimes an old public house is purchased, and used as a church building,&lt;ref name=conc/&gt; retaining the welcome and feel of a pub.  Others rent a room in an existing pub,&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; and church happens with the context of the functioning public house.

==Critique==
This has been said to be an example of what Nicholas M Healy calls "ecclesial [[bricolage]]."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas M. Healy ''Church, World and the Christian Life: Practical-Prophetic Ecclesiology'' (Cambridge: CUP, 2000) 181&lt;/ref&gt;  The church inhabits various aspects of its culture, and attempts to use them in its mission, sometimes unaware that each aspect has both positive and negative possibilities. In this case, the advantages of mission activity may not outweigh the difficulty of demonstrating a distinct community investing in clearly different values. This is because of what might be sacrificed in order to be "relevant." [[Lesslie Newbigin|Newbigin]] comments that the church should be both distinct from its culture and comprehensible by it.&lt;ref&gt;Lesslie Newbigin ''Foolishness to the Greeks: the Gospel and Western Culture'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1986) 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; Pub church treads this fine line.

{{Hinduism}}
'''Ramlila''' ('''Rāmlīlā''') (literally '[[Rama]]’s [[lila (Hinduism)|lila or play]]') is any dramatic folk re-enactment of the life of Rama according to the ancient Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'' or secondary literature based on it such as the ''[[Ramcharitmanas]]''.{{sfn|James G.

Rama is the seventh [[avatar]] of the Hindu god [[Vishnu]] and the central figure of the ''Ramayana'', a Sanskrit epic that integrates performance arts with stories driven by ethical values. The epic text is dated to 1st millennium BCE, and Ramlila is an adaptation of those stories. Most Ramlilas in North India are based on the 16th century secondary work on Ramayana, ''[[Ramcharitmanas]]'' a verse form composition in the regional vernacular language ([[Hindi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jennifer Lindsay|title=Between Tongues: Translation And/of/in Performance in Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ks-nUAO_fJgC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2006|publisher=National University of Singapore Press|isbn=978-9971-69-339-8|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;), by [[Tulsidas]].&lt;ref name=unescodussehra/&gt;&lt;ref name=claus507/&gt;{{sfn|Constance Jones|James D. Ryan|2006|p=457}} These verses are used as dialogues in traditional adaptations. Open-air productions are staged by local Ramlila committees (''Samitis''), and funded entirely by the villagers or local neighborhoods in urban areas.{{sfn|James G. Lochtefeld|2002|pp=561-562}} The core team of performance artists train for the dance-drama, but the actual performance attracts impromptu participants from the audience and villagers.&lt;ref name=unescodussehra/&gt; This art form is a part of the Hindu culture, found for many gods and goddesses, but those of Rama, [[Durga]] (as Durga Puja) and [[Krishna]] (as [[Rasa lila]]) are the most popular and annual events in the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|James G. Lochtefeld|2002|p=389}}

The Ramlila festivities were declared by [[UNESCO]] as one of the "Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity" in 2008. Ramlila is particularly notable in historically important Hindu cities of [[Ayodhya]], [[Varanasi]], [[Vrindavan]], [[Almora]], [[Satna]] and [[Madhubani district|Madhubani]] – cities in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.&lt;ref name=unescodussehra/&gt;{{sfn|James G. Lochtefeld|2002|pp=561-562}} The epic and its dramatic play migrated into southeast Asia in the 1st millennium CE, and ''Ramayana'' based ''Ramlila'' is a part of performance arts culture of Indonesia particularly the Hindu society of [[Bali]], [[Myanmar]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandakranta Bose|title=The Ramayana Revisited|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Ar2Qfr-UeQC |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-516832-7|pages=342–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th and 20th centuries, with the movement of Asian diaspora into European colonies as [[indentured servants]], the cultural celebration of Ramlila is now found in many parts of the world.&lt;ref name=un/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ignca.nic.in/dvd_ramlila.htm Ramlila - The traditional performance of Ramayana - Part I &amp; II] ''[[Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and nomenclature==
''Ramlila'' is a compound Sanskrit words "Rama" (a Vishnu [[avatar]]) and "Lila" (play, game, sport). According to James Lochtefeld, the word connotes a "playful drama about Rama", where it is both entertainment and a "deeply serious religious act" that has spiritual significance to both the actors and the audience.{{sfn|James G. Lochtefeld|2002|p=389}}

A literal translation of Ram Lila, states Norvin Hein, is "Rama's sport" where the term "sport" is best understood in a theological context. According to the Vaishnava thought, the Supreme Being (Vishnu) has no need to create the empirical world, he just descends as an avatar and manifests in the empirical world to "spontaneously, joyfully, disinterestedly play a part" or engage in "sports".&lt;ref name=hein279&gt;{{cite journal|author = Norvin Hein| title= The Ram Lila| journal = Journal of American Folklore| year=1958| jstor= 538562| volume= 71| number= 281| pages=279–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teams or companies of actors that train together and perform Ramlila are called ''Mandalis''.&lt;ref name=hein279/&gt;

Ramlila is one of many performance arts-related festivities within [[Hinduism]].{{sfn|James G. Lochtefeld|2002|p=389}} Ramayana epic is dated to the 1st millennium BCE, and is one of the oldest [[Itihasa]] genre of Indian literature. It is unclear however as to when the first performances of Ramlila were held. The first enactment of ''[[Ramcharitmanas]]'' by 16th century [[Tulsidas]] is undocumented, but according to the tradition, his student Megha Bhagat started the ''Ramcharitmanas''-based Ramlila in 1625.&lt;ref name=claus507&gt;{{cite book|author= William Sax|editor1= Peter J.

[[File:A relief summary of Ramayana at Hindu temple cave 16 Ellora India.jpg|thumb|The ''Ramayana'' relief artwork in 8th century Cave 16 of Ellora suggests its importance to Indian society by then.&lt;ref name=vatsyayan335/&gt;]]
According to John Brockington, a professor of Sanskrit specializing on Indian epics, Ramlila is likely an ancient tradition of India because it is generally accepted by scholars that written manuscripts emerged later in Indian religions, and ancient texts were largely a product of [[oral tradition]].&lt;ref name="Brockington1998p2"/&gt; Thus, not only Ramalila, but all ancient epics of India must very likely have been recited and transmitted by [[bard]]s and students in Ramlila-like manner, verbally from one generation to another, and consistently preserved across a wide geographic region by rules of acting by many teams. Further, states Brockington, the Hindu epics are too vast, with the ''Ramayana'' containing 20,000 verses and the ''Mahabharata'' with 100,000 verses, to have been preserved over two thousand years without being written down and without reciting and acting out. It is therefore unlikely that the Ramlila tradition emerged only in the modern era.&lt;ref name="Brockington1998p2"/&gt;

Some colonial era Indologists suggested, adds Brockington, that the ''Ramayana'' is a modern era text, but this hypothesis has since been abandoned because the existence of the Hindu ''Ramayana'' has been attested in Jainism literature, Ramayana [[relief]]s in cave temples such as [[Ellora Caves]], and southeast Asian temple carvings and culture by the 1st millennium CE.&lt;ref name="Brockington1998p2"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

According to Norvin Hein, the contemporary Ramlila started once the ''Manas'' text of Tulsidas had been composed in the 16th century. However, states Hein, a dance-drama form of Ramayana enactment flourished at least in the Mathura region much earlier, possibly around the early centuries of the common era by the [[Vaishnavism]] tradition of Hinduism. He traces the evidence for this in the [[Kathakali]], [[Yaksagana]], [[Kathak]] and other [[Indian classical dance]]s which share segments, themes and styles with Ramlila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Lutgendorf|title=The Life of a Text: Performing the Rāmcaritmānas of Tulsidas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=19zvfkwXyzUC&amp;pg=PA254 |year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06690-8|pages=254–258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Prinsep]] wrote an eyewitness description of [[Varanasi]] Ramlila festivities in 1825, while H. Niehus wrote another from [[Ghazipur]] in 1905.&lt;ref name=hein279/&gt; Norvin Hein described the Ramlila of 1949 and 1950, a period of socio-political turmoil in India after the British India partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan. Hein reported his observations from Ramilila in [[Mathura]].&lt;ref name=hein279/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Rama Sita.jpg|thumb|left|Ramlila revolves around the epic of Rama and Sita.]]
The Ramlila is the story of Hindu god Rama from his birth. The epic recites his childhood along with those of others who are major characters in it, such as Sita, Lakshmana, Ravana and others. It includes chapters on the marriage of Sita and Rama, the exile of Rama because [[Dharma]] requires him to give up his throne, Sita and Lakshmana joining him in the exile, their journeys through India and they meeting revered [[Rishi]]s of Hinduism, the abduction of Sita by demon Ravana, the sorrow of Rama and Lakshmana, their hopelessness, how they creatively build an army from other living beings in the forest such as monkeys, their journey to Lanka to confront Ravana, the battle between the good and evil, the destruction of Ravana, the return of Rama to Ayodhya and as king, and the life thereafter.&lt;ref name="SchechnerHess51"/&gt;&lt;ref name=heinfull/&gt;{{sfn|David R. Kinsley|1989 |pp=91-108}}
 
Ramlila festivals play this story. It is organized in numerous villages, towns and neighborhoods during the autumn [[Navratri]] festival season which typically falls in September or October. The festival is both a religious and cultural event, bringing the population together, states UNESCO, "without distinction of caste, religion or age".&lt;ref name=unescodussehra/&gt; The audience such as the villagers participate spontaneously, playing roles or help out in setting and cleaning up the stage, making costumes, and upkeep of the Ramlila area.&lt;ref name=unescodussehra/&gt;

[[File:Fair View.JPG|thumb|A rural Ramlila stage setup in progress in India. The large effigy is of Ravana who is destroyed at the end.]]
Traditionally organized in a makeshift open-air theatre at night, it is usually staged by amateur acting teams drawn from all segments of the society.&lt;ref name="SchechnerHess51"/&gt;&lt;ref name=heinfull/&gt; Singers and musicians, men and women, elderly and youth play different parts, sing the verses to music, recite dialogues. The recitations and the narrative of the play are usually based on ''Ramacharitamanas''. The dialog is improvised, and often responsive to audience reactions. [[Dhol]] drummers and other musicians participate. The atmosphere is usually festive and free, with the audience whistling and commenting as the story proceeds. The stage is surrounded by food stalls and larger productions have a [[fair]] nearby. Surrounding areas temporarily transform into [[bazaar]]s to cater to the audience. A committee (''samiti'') heads the preparation.&lt;ref name=heinfull/&gt; In many rural areas, traditional venues for Ramlila have developed over the centuries, and hundreds of people will often make the trip nightly to attend the play, by walking over miles like a religious pilgrimage in earlier times. Actors typically don't get paid, or get paid little for their efforts, but they are provided free food and accommodation by the villagers or committee. Performance costs are usually financed by [[fundraising]] in the community, often by self-organized Ramlila Committees.&lt;ref name="SchechnerHess51"/&gt;&lt;ref name=heinfull/&gt;&lt;ref name= Schechner161/&gt;

A Ramlila is not a simple play acted out in a drama theatre, but it is structured to encourage and allow the audience to participate. In major productions, the audience walk with the actors from one site to another, they chant or co-recite passage, they immerse themselves as minor or significant characters in the play, while the major roles are played by a troupe of artists. The audience cheers when the good gets the upper hand, they are sorrowful when a wrong happens such as the kidnapping of Sita and her imprisonment against her will by demon Ravana. They participate in the burning of the effigies, and the community welcome during the return of Rama back to Ayodhya. It is theologically an immersion experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Lutgendorf|title=The Life of a Text: Performing the Rāmcaritmānas of Tulsidas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=19zvfkwXyzUC&amp;pg=PA322|year= 1991|publisher= University of California Press|isbn= 978-0-520-06690-8|pages= 322–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Schechner|title=The Future of Ritual: Writings on Culture and Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jker43aWu2AC&amp;pg=PA180|year=1993|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-04689-3|pages=180–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variations==
[[File:Ramlila.jpg|thumb|Lead performers of a Ramlila troupe ''mandali'', with the director, called ''vyasa'']]
Today, several regions have developed their distinctive form of Ramlila, [[Uttar Pradesh]] itself has numerous variants of presentation styles, most prominent among them is that of [[Ramnagar, Varanasi]] which is a 31-day event, while most Ramlila elsewhere are typically abridged 10 day event climaxing in Dussehra.&lt;ref name="SchechnerHess51"/&gt;&lt;ref name=heinfull&gt;{{cite journal|author = Norvin Hein| title= The Ram Lila| journal = Journal of American Folklore| year=1958| jstor= 538562| volume= 71| number= 281| pages=279–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other variants include the [[pantomime]] style is visible in ''jhankis'' or tableaux pageants, where colourful Jhankis and pageants depicting scenes from the life of Lord Rama are taken out through the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.up-tourism.com/fair_festival/ramlila.htm Ramlila] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704112935/http://www.up-tourism.com/fair_festival/ramlila.htm |date=2008-07-04 }} Department of Tourism, Government of UP, [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2008 [[UNESCO]] report, the most notable Ramlila traditions are those observed annually at [[Ayodhya]], [[Ramnagar, Varanasi|Ramnagar]] and [[Varanasi]], [[Vrindavan]], [[Almora]], [[Satna]] and [[Madhubani, India|Madhubani]].&lt;ref name=un&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=38 Ramlila - the Traditional Performance of the Ramayana] ''[[UNESCO]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variant is the [[operatic]] style incorporates elements of folk theatre elements generously, while the traditional style remains, where the couplets of Ramacharitmanas not only act as dialogues, but also as chorus as well, and lastly there is the Ramlila staged by professional troupes called "mandalis".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharatonline.com/uttar-pradesh/culture/ramlila.html Ramlila in Uttar Pradesh] www.bharatonline.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Many urban Ramilias now have dialogues written in ''Khadi Boli'' or in local dialects, but the treatment remains melodramatic as always to achieve maximum impact amidst an audience that knows the story by heart, but watches the enactment nevertheless for religious fervour and also for its spectacle value, making Ramlila an important event in the religious as well as social calendar of not only in small town and villages but also many big cities. Just other folk theatre form of India, like [[Jatra (Bengal)|Jatra]] of Bengal, topic themes are often interwoven in the script to had relevance and sometimes humour is used to offer a critic or commentary over current happenings.

===Ramlila at Ramnagar, Varanasi===
The tradition of staging the Ramlila at [[Ramnagar, Varanasi]], which lies across the Ganges river from the Hindu pilgrimage city of [[Varanasi]], was started in ca 1830 by [[Maharaja Udit Narayan Singh]], [[Kashi Naresh]] with the help of Pandit Laxmi Narayan Pandey's family (present vyas ji of the Ramlila of Ramnagar).&lt;ref&gt;[http://varanasi.nic.in/culture/fair.html Ramleela - Ramnagar] ''[[Varanasi]]'' Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eich&gt;{{cite book | first = Swati  | last = Mitra | title = Good Earth Varanasi city guide | publisher = Eicher Goodearth Limited | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-81-87780-04-5 | page = 216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It rose in popularity during the reign of his successor Maharaj Isvari Prasad Singh, and received continued patronage from the subsequent Kings of the [[Royal House of Benares]] to create a participatory [[environmental theatre]] (Site-specific theatre) on a grand scale, where attendance ranges from few thousands to 100,000 for others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/26/arts/26SCHE.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5070&amp;en=eb222a8aebe766e2&amp;ex=1232514000 A Maharajah´s Festival for Body and Soul] ''[[New York Times]]'', Monday, March 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ramlila is a cycle of plays which recounts the epic story of [[Lord Rama]], as told in ''[[Ramcharitmanas]]'', the version of the [[Ramayana]] penned by [[Tulsidas]]. The plays sponsored by the Maharaja, are performed in Ramnagar every evening for 31 days.&lt;ref name=eich/&gt; The Ramnagar Ramlila is held over 31 days where the entire ''Ramacharitmanas'' is recited, instead of usual 10 for abridged production. It is known for its lavish sets, dialogues and visual spectacle.  In Ramnagar, a number of stages have been constructed by the town, each named after the major sites of events in the ''Ramayana'' epic. The permanent structures and several temporary structure serve as sets, to represent locations like [[Ashok Vatika]], Janakpuri, [[Panchavati]], [[Lanka]] etc., during the performance. Hence the entire city turn into a giant open-air set, and audience moves along with the performers with every episode, to the next locale. As the play progresses, the actors and audience move from one place to another, they join the chorus, giving the feel that the audience is participating and is a part of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Schechner|title=The Future of Ritual: Writings on Culture and Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jker43aWu2AC&amp;pg=PA134 |year=1993|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-04689-3|pages=134–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tex/&gt;

[[File:An Ramlila Actor In The Role of Ravana.jpg|left|thumb|A Ramlila actor the traditional attire of [[Ravana]]]]
Preparations begin, weeks before its commencement, even the audition process is traditionally attended to by the Maharaja, where ''Svarupas'', literally divine embodiment, the various characters of the Ramayana, are chosen from amongst local actors. Important roles are often inherited by families, for example, the role of [[Ravana]] was held by same family from 1835 to 1990, and roles of Hanuman, Jatayu, and Janaka traditionally belong to one Vyasa family.&lt;ref name=tex&gt;[http://www.comm.unt.edu/histofperf/CGordon/The%20Performance.htm Ramlila: The Performance in Ramnagar] ''[[University of North Texas]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Navratri|Dussehra]] festivities are inaugurated with a colourful pageant [[Kashi Naresh]] rides an elephant at the head of the procession.&lt;ref name=eich/&gt; Then, resplendent in silk and brocade, he inaugurates the month-long [[Theatre|folk theatre]] of ''Ramlila'' at [[Ramnagar Fort|Ramnagar]].&lt;ref name=eich/&gt; During the period, hundreds of [[sadhus]] called ''Ramayanis'' descend into the town to watch and recite the Ramcharitmanas text.

During the course of the performance, there is a double transformation of the space within the city, as it first transforms from a city to theatre and then to mythic geography, as the scale of the performance is gradually increased to mythic proportions, coming down only in the end, when Rama finally returns home, this is when the Raja himself becomes part of the theatre thereby incorporating local element into the story itself. In the end, as the ''swarups'', actors depart, they take off their garlands and offer it to Royal family members and give [[Darśana|darshan]] to audience, after the performance one last time.&lt;ref name=rit&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lZEOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=Ramlila&amp;as_brr=0#PPA169,M1 Ramlila of Ramanagar] ''The future of ritual: writings on culture and performance'', by Richard Schechner.

Raja Ramchandra ki Jai!' resound in the air, as the audience join in. Thereafter, a ''jhanki'', literally a peep or glimpse, tableaux of frozen iconic moments from the 'Manas', is presented, which not only distill and crystallize the message of the story for the audience, but is also appreciated for its spectacular effect.&lt;ref name=rit/&gt;

Though several local legends exist regarding the beginning of this Ramlila, including one of which suggests that it was first staged at a nearby village, Chota Mirzapur as the one at Varanasi was disrupted due to the floods in the Ganges, from where it evolved to the present Ramlila, which is by far the most traditional rendition of the Ramayana, and has been a subject of study by scholars from all over the world for many decades now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stthomasu.ca/~parkhill/lila.htm "What's Taking Place: Neighborhood Ramlilas in Banaras" by Thomas Parkhill] ''Living Banaras: Hindu Religion in Cultural Context'',  Bradley R.

==Geographic spread==
[[File:Javanese Dance Ramayana Shinta 2.jpg|thumb|A modern Ramayana production.]]
Over the centuries, Ramlila has evolved into a highly venerated art form, and has travelled to far corners of the globe, through [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]], not as acts of "cultural recovery", rather as fresh expressions of a persistent faith. Today, Ramalila is staged in most countries that with immigrant [[Hindu]] populations from the [[Indian subcontinent]], including that from [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Pakistan]]. Outside the Indian subcontinent, this includes [[Fiji]], [[Mauritius]], [[South Africa]], [[Canada]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Great Britain]], [[The Netherlands]], the [[United States]], and [[Australia]]. Some [[Asia]]n cultures have similar drama traditions based on the Ramayana, for instance the [[Phra Lak Phra Lam]] (Lak and Lam are the Laotian names for [[Lakshmana|Lakshman]] and Ram, respectively) [[Dance and theater of Laos|folkplay of Laos and northeastern Thailand]].

The Rama story is also enacted in another popular art form as a night time fire shadow or day time puppet show. This is known as ''Tolapavakuthu'' in [[Kerala]], ''Ravana chaya'' in [[Odisha]], ''Nang sbek thom'' in Cambodia, ''Nang yai'' in Thailand and ''Wayang purwa'' in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandakranta Bose|title=The Ramayana Revisited|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Ar2Qfr-UeQC&amp;pg=PA346|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-516832-7|pages=346–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruth Virginia Bayton''' (5 February 1907 – 195?) was an [[United States|America]]n-born entertainer and actress, well known in [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]] and [[Argentina]].

==Early life==

Ruth Virginia Bayton, was originally born February 3, 1907 (or 1903) in [[Tappahannock, Virginia]] as the sixth child of Virginia and Hansford C. Bayton, a well known river boat captain who operated an excursion steamer in the Tidewater section along the Virginian coast.&lt;ref name="courier"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/40035471/|title=No.15 – Ruth Bayton|publisher=Pittsburgh Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after 1910, Ruth was sent to [[Philadelphia]] to live with her uncle, George Bayton, a wealthy and well respected physician. Occasionally, she also stayed in [[Baltimore]] with her eldest sister, Julia Bayton-Banks, who ran a restaurant with her husband Carter Banks and their six children.

==Career==

===Early career (1922–1925)===

In the summer 1922, after finishing school and she finding work as an stenographer, she was introduced to Will Vodrey, director of the Plantation Orchestra, who helped her into the chorus of the [[Florence Mills]] "Plantation Revue".&lt;ref name="courier" /&gt;  The following summer, director Lew Leslie took the revue to [[London]] as "From Dixie to Dover Street". The show did extremely well, and returned to the US to play on Broadway in 1924 as "Dixie to Broadway". In 1925, she appeared in "Tan Town Topics", with [[Ethel Waters]] as the leading star and [[Josephine Baker]] in the chorus.&lt;ref name="courier" /&gt;

===Arrival in Europe (1926)===

In 1926, the show arrived at [[Paris]]'s Restaurant des Ambassadeurs as "Blackbirds of 1926". The show opened on May 28,  it was a sensation. Some of France's top stars attended, including [[Maurice Chevalier]], [[Sacha Guitry]], [[Yvonne Vallee]], the Dolly Sisters and even [[Josephine Baker]], who drifted in an hour late. The show moved over in July to the [[Theatre des Champs-Elysees]], where Josephine Baker made her debut months earlier. One night, she was approached by Henri Lartigue, who worked for the William Morris Booking Agency and organized for the show to come to France,  who offered her a lucrative contract in [[Berlin]] with a weekly salary of $200.&lt;ref name="Americans In Paris"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=x349AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XisMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=395%2C8746706|title=Americans In Paris|publisher=The Afro-American}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth signed the contract right then and there, agreeing to come work at the theatre in the following month, and afterward kept her own counsel.  Several weeks later, Ruth departed immediately to appear at the Admiralspalast all-black revue "An Und Aus" in-between rehearsals for a much larger show at the Theatre des Westens. On August 4, "Der Zug Nach dem Westen" opened and Ruth made her appeared in a girdle of a dozen bananas. Her dancing was a large success to the German press with her extravagant jungle interpretation surrounded by a cast of 200.&lt;ref name="Americans In Paris"/&gt; The revue was taken to the Apollotheater in [[Vienna]] for the winter before being rearranged into a new version with skimpier costumes and more American performers such as Ben Tyber and Louis Douglas under the name, "Wissen Sie Schon" opening in March 1927 and running for another three months. she appeared in the tableau 'Der Gott und Die Bajadere', dancing completely nude except for a silver loincloth in front of a large statue of Buddha; This time with a larger salary of $600. It's hard to say how much is truth, if any, there is in the many stories in Berlin, which state that a handsome Spanish Marquis would appear with Ruth late at night in the streets of the Friedrichstrasse and under the shadows of the Unter-Der-Linden. Later it was claimed that this Don Juan was none other than King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]]. Undoubtedly, much of this gossip was generated by her onstage image as the personification of unbridled sexuality, just as her counterpart, Josephine Baker. That summer, Ruth appeared in [[Hamburg]] at the Argentinean-themed Trocadero Kabarett where she was showered with flowers and the German press billed her as the 'Most Beautiful Creole on the Continent.'

===Spain (1927)===

Ruth soon decided it was time to move on, and after an appearance in the French resort town [[Biarritz]] to perform for a charity event at the Chateau-Basque, accompanied the Spanish actor, Valeriano Ruiz Paris, into [[Barcelona]] to open his revue, "Not-Yet" at the Teatro Cómico where she introduced her new dance, the Chotiston, which was a mixture of the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] and the [[Chotis]]. While in Barcelona, she was followed by an old friend, Robert Wiene, a German film director, who wanted Ruth to star on in his latest film based on the love affair of one of the most gallant European Sovereigns and the most beautiful colored dancer in Europe at the moment. Filming wrapped up by the end of September and the German crew returned to Berlin. Ruth also moved on, in October, to [[Valencia]] to appear in the El Folies-Bergere cabaret, where a painting of herself (and Josephine Baker) hung above the stage. The following month, she travelled to [[Madrid]] to star in, "Noche Loca" at the Teatro Maravillas&lt;ref name="Ruth Bayton en Maravillas"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002123732&amp;page=21&amp;search=Ruth+Bayton&amp;lang=en|title=Ruth Bayton en Maravillas|publisher=Nuevo Mundo (Madrid)}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a white American orchestra with a salary of $800 and musical scores composed by the famous [[Francisco Alonso]]. After hours, she performed at the exclusive Maipu-Pigall's nightclub, where King Alfonso and the Primo de Rivera was noted to frequent.&lt;ref name="Maipu Pigall's"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0031068738&amp;page=6&amp;search=Ruth+Bayton&amp;lang=en|title=Maipu Pigall's|publisher=El Liberal}}&lt;/ref&gt; That winter, before she could accept Louis Douglas's offer to appear in his Black Follies revue at the Teatro Comedia, Paul Derval, director of the [[Folies Bergere]], invited her to return to Paris for the new season, as Josephine was leaving for a world tour.

===France (1928–1930)===

Rehearsals for "La Grande Folie" began in February in-between her appearances at the Casanova nightclub. Meanwhile, however, she was approached by the director of the Folies-Wagram, a new musichall to be inaugurated the following month with "Revue Wagram", but Ruth turned him down. But early March, after two weeks at the Folies-Bergere, moved on to the Folies-Wagram. Avoiding Paul Derval for the next three months, she appeared with Marie Dubas dancing in the finale of the first act with tall and graceful, slim ankles, shapely well molded thighs, willowy but well developed body covered in the right proportion of blue ostrich feathers. But the rumors of her affair with the Spanish Monarch began to resurface, when her German film was released in on April 12. The Spanish government offered the German producers $187, 000 to destroy the film, or at least prevent it from appearing in France and Spain.&lt;ref name="The Afro-American"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5X49AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XisMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=281%2C13136569|title=Ruth Bayton's Romance with King Revealed|publisher=The Afro-American}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was making conquests in high society and on her string was Germany's wealthiest bankers. She lived at the Hotel Ambassador with a fine $10,000 [[Hispano-Suiza]] driven by a chauffeur and two maids. Something she would have never accomplished in America. "Absolutely impossible," she later remarked to a visiting journalist, "I would have never been given the opportunity. I love Paris, the German people have been very kind, and so have the folks in Spain." After working at Floresco Bonbonniere, she spent the summer in [[Deauville]], dancing at the seaside casinos and appearing at the racetracks with a new admirer Armand Rochefoucauld, 'Marquis de Deauville'. At the Concert Mayol cabaret in late November Ruth was back dancing beside Marie Dubas in, "Cochon Qui Sommeille" (The Slumbering Pig) before returning for a  quick appearance in Berlin's Barberina Kabarett, where she complained that the audience would try to grab her she danced. But the constant gloomy presence of the strongly emerging right-wing movement which was bent on purging the decadence of [[Weimar Germany]]. This was, of course, the infant Nazi movement and to them Ruth represented the both decadence and racial impurity in Germany.

In January, Ada 'Bricktop' Smith, left behind her old establishment of the Grand Duc, and opened Chez Bricktop's on the Place Pigalle. Besides Edith Wilson and [[Zaidee Jackson]], Ruth returned from the German capital to appear. During this time, she purchased an apartment at 77 Champs-Elysees, once briefly occupied by Jo Baker herself. Soon she ran into Leon Abbey and his orchestra, and joined him on his Spanish tour to play in [[Seville]] which was hosting the Exposición Ibero-Americana. There was lots of money to be made as American tourists filled the nightclubs and theatres of the Andalucian city. There was also Barcelona's Exposició Internacional where they made an appearance on the Expo grounds. On her own however, Ruth also returned to Madrid and danced through the winter at the Maipu-Pigall's cabaret, which was known to be frequented by the Spanish monarch. On March 8, she rejoined Abbey's band in London to appear at the Deauville Restaurant. After two weeks, Leon was deported back to Paris for not obtaining his work permits before arriving in Britain. That summer, after an invitation while appearing in London, returned to Paris for the Theatre Apollo where she appeared with the dramatic singer, Damia and the American dancer Jack Forester in the new 'oriental-themed' revue "Revue Milliardaire".&lt;ref name="Revue Milliardaires"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7639989b/f4.item.r=Ruth%20Bayton.zoom|title=Courrier des Theatres|publisher=Paris-Soir}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, Ruth was chosen for the Oriental-style finale of the first act as [[Scheherazade]] in the 'Slave Merchant' sketch. After hours, she would dance the tango and mingle amongst her Spanish friends at the El Garron cabaret. After the triumphal revue closed in August, she joined Sam Wooding's band in "La Jungle Enchante" at the Theatre Olympia before moving over to the Theatre Marigny on September 7. In December 1930, as France prepared itself for the upcoming Exposition Coloniale, Ruth returned to New York to try her luck back in America to showcase her talents that were so well publicized in Europe.

=== Return to United States (1931–1932)===

Upon arriving, she bought a spacious apartment in the elite [[Sugar Hill, Manhattan|Sugar Hill]] district near Harlem, but was immediately offered to return to France to accompany [[Noble Sissle]]'s Orchestra at the Restaurant des Ambassadeurs. However, the French authorities were making determined efforts to reduce the number foreign workers, including overseas musicians, in their country. Ruth got wind of a rumor that suggested that Sissle's band would only be able permitted to fulfill the second half of its booking if 50 percent of its personnel were replaced was replaced with French artists. This proved to be the truth, and Ruth immediately declined the offer, remaining in New York to open a small boutique selling precious perfumes and fur wraps, until she got bored with the idea of being a businesswoman. The idea of being away from the stage brought her back into the nightlife, appearing in some of Harlem's popular establishments like [[Savoy Ballroom]] and the [[Small's Paradise]] in "Ethel Baird's Revue". However, her large fortune she accumulated abroad quickly faded away as she was unable to work under the same standards as she had in Europe. Early 1932, Ruth was offered a role in a floorshow at a ritzy [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] cabaret and struck it rich again when she foiled a holdup and was awarded handsomely.&lt;ref name="Ex-King's Playgirl Gone Missing"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9gMnAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OwMGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2286%2C2967539|title=Ex-King's Playgirl Gone Missing|publisher=The Afro-American}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November, she was appearing in [[Newark, New Jersey]] and renting rooms from the mother of an old friend, Crackshot Hackley. It was there she got into an argument with one the tenants, John Burtt, white director of the Lafayette Theatre. This ended in Ruth beating him with a dog chain from one her numerous pets. The fight later involved Crackshot and his mother.&lt;ref name="Famed Actress, Noted for Beauty, In Free for All"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%2023/Pittsburgh%20PA%20Courier/Pittsburgh%20PA%20Courier%201932/Pittsburgh%20PA%20Courier%201932%20a%20-%200344.pdf|title=Famed Actress In Free For All|publisher=The Pittburgh Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this scandal, Ruth packed her bags and informed her family she was moving to Spain (under a new stage name).

===Spain (1933–1937)===

In February 1933, French press announced her return to France on the SS Lafayette. They were most enthusiastic about the return of their 'Belle Creole', but the depression arrived in Europe that winter, causing the economy to fall apart and public demonstrations all across France. Despite business in [[Montmartre]] to becoming rather slow, she was found performing at the Rio-Rita Cabaret. Ruth's appearances began to become sparse and she was later departed for Deauville, entertaining at the Bar du Soleil and Casino de Deauville. 79-year old Cora E. Rollins of [[Chicago]], who spent the weekend visiting her son-in-law, Alex Carpenter, orchestra director of the Casino, ran into Ruth, whom she had met as a child in Philadelphia. Mrs. Rollins: "Miss Bayton tried to persuade me to try my luck at the tables, but as I'm admittedly a bad loser, declined." Josephine Baker, who was also appearing at the Bar Soleil was  enamored with Ruth's German banker lover, who was visiting and tried to become close with her old buddy in order to receive an introduction. But Ruth was no longer interested in reconnecting with her old cohort and wasn't naive about Jo's motives and snubbed her old friend. Soon afterwards, she departs to Spain and takes up residence in Madrid, where she continues working under another alias until [[Francisco Franco]] staged a military coup in [[Spanish Morocco]] on the 17th of July 1936, which made its way to south-western Spain quickly capturing southern and northwestern Spain. The country began to split into numerous factions, which quickly turned this [[Spanish Civil War|small coup into a civil war]]. Back home, her family was worried sick about her whereabouts. They hadn't heard anything from her, since her return in 1933, when she stopped writing home. During the spring of 1937, they were still unable to contact Ruth when her Uncle George died. Soon however, there were strange rumors that she escaped into South America.&lt;ref name="Ruth Bayton or the ghost of Modernity and Jazz."&gt;{{cite news|url=https://palomitasenlosojos.com/2013/01/02/ruth-bayton-o-el-fantasma-de-la-modernidad-y-el-jazz/|title=Ruth Bayton o el fantasma de la modernidad y el jazz.|publisher=Palomitas en los Ojos}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed by the summer, when she wrote home finally, her letters listed having arrived from [[Buenos Aires]]. Like many Spanish artists, she had escaped to [[Argentina]], achieving huge success, both theatrically and romantically.

===Argentina and later life (1938–1950)===

During the summer of 1938, she even (for some unknown reason) stood trial at the Palacio de Justicia: "By order of Mr. Investigating Judge for Criminal Matters in the capital of Argentina, Dr. Antonio L. Beiuti, is quoted calls and summons Ruth "Virginia" Bayton, so that within thirty days, computed from the first publication of this, appear to be right in the cause for false testimony that followed, failing to declare rebellious if not done." She remained in Argentina until the [[Spanish Civil War]] ended in 1939, however found it difficult to work under Franco's strict regime, and sometime after the outbreak of the German invasion of Poland, returned home to Buenos Aires, despite its pro-German attitude. Shortly after the military coup during July 1943, Ruth returned to the United States for a brief visit.

After WWII ended and shortly after [[Juan Peron]]'s rise to power, Ruth left to tour war-torn Europe early 1946. That spring, she left Europe from London aboard the SS John Ericsson back to New York, entertaining American troops and refugees along the way. She maintained a residence in New York until late 1947, afterwards relocating to [[Los Angeles]], California where she eventually passed away, at some unknown date, although it's believed to be sometime during the late-1950s.

[[File:Die Gartenlaube (1875) b 469.jpg|thumb|''Schnorrer of Poland'' in [[Leipzig]], Germany From: [[Die Gartenlaube]] (1875)]]
'''''Schnorrer''''' ([[wikt:שנאָרער|שנאָרער]]; also spelled '''''shnorrer''''') is a [[Yiddish]] term meaning "[[beggar]]" or "sponger".&lt;ref&gt;''jewishencyclopedia.com'' -

|title=Schnorrer
|accessdate=24 June 2009

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Schnorrer'' also occurs in [[German language|German]] to describe a [[freeloader]] who frequently asks for little things, like cigarettes or little sums of money, without offering a return. The [[English language|English]] usage of the word denotes a sly chiseler who will get money out of his acquaintances any way he can, often through an air of entitlement. A ''schnorrer'' is distinguished from an ordinary beggar by dint of his boundless [[chutzpah]]. Like "moocher", "schnorrer" does not apply to direct [[beggar|begging]] or destitution, but rather a habit of getting things (food, tools) by politely or insistently borrowing them with no intention of return.

The term, which is used in a [[pejorative]] or [[irony|ironic]] sense, can also be used as a [[backhanded compliment]] to someone's perseverance, cleverness, or thrift. For instance, [[Azriel Hildesheimer]], known for his travels around [[Europe]] to spread his [[rabbi]]nical wisdom to the poor, and for his refusal to accept payment for his services, was sometimes referred to as the "international ''schnorrer''" for his reliance on the local community to house and feed him wherever he went. Alternatively, [[Theodor Herzl]] described his early Eastern European immigrant supporters among the ''[[Ostjuden]]'', as his "army of ''schnorrers''".&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], ''A History of the Jews'', p.398-99: "Herzl found himself visited by shabby, excitable Jews from distant parts, to the dismay of his fashionable wife, who grew to detest the very word Zionism. Yet these were the men who became the foot soldiers, indeed the NCOs and officers, in the Zionist legion; Herzl called them his 'army of schnorrers'. The 'army' met publicly for the first time on 29 August 1897..."&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Israel Zangwill]] later described a ''schnorrer'' as a beggar who would chide a donor for not giving enough. The [[Schnorrer Club of Morrisania]] was a [[German-American]] social club in the [[Bronx, New York]].

Schnorrers sometimes begged for the dowries of poor women (Hakhnasat Kallah); a practice which was allowed even when it disrupted the public study of the [[Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;''jewishvirtuallibrary.org'' - [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02291.html Begging and Beggars]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the word is the origin of the modern [[Hebrew]] verb לשנורר (leshnorer), which can be roughly defined as "getting small things without offering return."

'''Shelem'''({{lang-fa|شلم }} ''Shělěm''), also called '''Rok''' or similar, is an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[trick-taking game|trick-taking]] [[card game]] with four players in two partnerships, bidding and competing against each other. It is similar to [[Spades (card game)|Spades]]{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and [[Hokm]], but bidding and [[trump (cards)|trump]] are declared in every hand by the bidding winner. Both the name and the point structure of this game are similar to the American game [[Rook (card game)|Rook]], there being a possible connection between the two games, although it is not clear as from which game it derives.&lt;ref name=penguin&gt;{{Citation

==Etymology==
The word shelem comes from the French word chelem (slam in English), as used in [[French tarot]], which means winning all the tricks in the round. The term slam is used in [[trick-taking game]]s such as [[Contract bridge|Bridge]], [[Spades]] and [[Whist]].

Each player receives 12 cards in batches of 4. The remaining 4 cards form a ''widow'', to be taken up by the player who makes a contract. Starting with [[eldest hand]], the players bid (in multiples of 5) for the privilege of taking up the widow and making trumps. The minimum bid is 100, and there are 165 points in the game. A player who does not want to overbid the previous bid may pass, but cannot bid again later in the same round. The highest bidder becomes ''declarer'', takes up the widow, and discards 4 cards face down to return to the original number of cards (12). The discarded pile becomes the declarer's team's first trick (including any points).

Declarer leads to the first trick. The suit of the card led becomes the trump suit. The remainder of the deal is played according to the standard trick-play rules as in [[Whist]] or [[Hokm]]. The cards discarded by the highest bidder count for declarer's party as in most comparable games, or for the winner of the last trick as in [[Rook (card game)|Rook]].&lt;!-- David Parlett does not say anything about this point. If someone knows which is correct, it can be stated here. --&gt;

Each party makes the card-points in tricks won plus 5 points for every trick. If declarer's party is successful, they score what they made, or 330 points if they win all tricks (i.e., achieve a shelem or slam). If they are not successful, they lose what they bid, doubled if they make less than their opponents. The opponents always score precisely what they made. There's no penalty for scoring points above the bid amount.

==Variations==
* Instead of declaring trumps with the first card played, declarer may also choose one of the following modes of play:
** In the '''Nares''' variation, the hierarchy of cards in trick-play is reversed and there are no trumps
** '''Ace-Nares''' is like Nares, but the aces are still the highest cards in trick-play.
** '''Sarres''': Sarres is plays like the normal game, ace down to 2 except that there is no ruling card in this game.
* The aces may be worth 15 card-points each, resulting in a total 185 points in the game.

==Glossary==
*'''Seesawing (Arreh keshi)''' - the situation when no bidding suit remains, except in the bidder hands and the bidder mate is holding and playing another winning suit from high to low, helping the bidder get rid of his holes.
*'''Khâli kardan'''- the situation were the claiming team can't succeed to get their bid value.
*'''Hole'''- A suit or sometimes suits which are the bid-winner player weak points.
*'''Hole-Free''' - When the bid-winner player has no weakness in his hand, his hand is called ''Hole-Free'' hand.
*'''Molali Koor''' - Literally means: Blind Clergy Ali's Hand. It is a hand that Shelems no matter what the teammate has. This hand is hole-free and usually happens a couple of times in a 1200-point tournament. 
*'''Jozve Khaan''' - Literally means: Booklet reader, and refers to players who have read the booklet of Shelem.
*'''Poisson distribution of hands''' - Refers to the equally distributed hands by means of their power. 
*'''Zamin''' - Literally means: Ground. The initial four cards which are set aside by the dealer.
*'''NaderShelem'''- Term given to the situation when the "hakem" forgets his "hokm".
*'''Chagh Kardan (khorak)'''- to play a card which has a point: 5, 10 or ace
*'''Daste Panke'''- Literally means: Fan Hand - term given to hand that is so good it wins the round even if you randomly play the cards (which happens if a fan is blowing at the cards instead of a player playing the hand)

'''''Suikoden Tierkreis''''' ({{nihongo|'''''Gensō Suikoden Tierkreis'''''|幻想水滸伝ティアクライス||with "Tierkreis" being [[German language|German]] for "[[Zodiac]]"}} is a [[role-playing video game]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] developed and published by [[Konami]] as part of the ''[[Suikoden]]'' series.  It was released in December 2008 in Japan, and released in English in Europe and North America in March 2009.  The game's development was led by project head Osamu Komuta, who had previously been a planner for ''[[Suikoden Tactics]]'', with a music staff composed of Norikaku Miura, [[Yoshino Aoki]], [[Masaharu Iwata]], and Kaori Komuro.  The game features the opening and ending theme songs "Tears in the Sky" and "Tierkreis" respectively, each performed by Japanese [[Japanese idol|pop idol]] [[Satomi Takasugi]].

Created as a spin-off of the main series of games, ''Suikoden Tierkreis'' was made to explore one of the myriad of worlds that exist in the ''Suikoden'' metaverse. Following the game's main theme of "the infinite possibility of future", players must assume the role of a young protagonist who gathers the combined forces of 108 heroes to attempt to defeat a powerful entity known as The One King, leader of The Order of the One True Way, who seeks to control the world by spreading his doctrine that all fate is predetermined and all people have no control of their lives.

==Gameplay==
[[File:suikodenteirkreis.jpg|thumb|left|A battle scene. Character information is on the top screen, while gameplay is shown on the bottom.]]
''Suikoden Tierkreis'' is a traditional [[JRPG]] where the player must navigate through three-dimensional environments and complete story-based objectives to advance the narrative. Taking advantage of the [[Nintendo DS]]' dual screens, gameplay, text, and menu options are often displayed on the bottom screen. On the field, the top screen shows a landscape image of the player's current location, along with the name of that location and season information. During battle the top screen also displays character information such as hit points, magic points, etc. Players move their character through the game using either the directional pad or the [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]] wand to take advantage of the DS' touchscreen function. While advancing through the game, the player must interact with non-player characters to move the story forward and allow new scenarios to become available for play, as well as to discover new items and areas.

During gameplay, players will randomly encounter enemy creatures every few steps while in hostile areas. Battles in ''Suikoden Tierkreis'' use a [[turn-based strategy|turn-based]] approach where players input commands for all active characters in their party before each combat round, with the corresponding actions taking place in accordance with each character's "speed" rating. A player's party may consist of up to four characters at a time, with special combination skills becoming available depending on which specific characters are included. When a player defeats a group of enemies, they are awarded experience points that go toward increasing their party member's levels, thereby making them stronger and able to use more special skills in battle. Defeated enemies may also provide trade items that can be sold for money to purchase goods in-game such as restorative items and better equipment that will allow the player to battle even stronger enemies. By using the DS' [[Wi-Fi]] function, two players each with their own game card can connect to each other to exchange characters and items, as well as gain access to unique battle scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cordeira, Jim |url=http://www.gaming-age.com/cgi-bin/previews/preview.pl?sys=nds&amp;game=suikoden_tierkreis |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215100030/http://gaming-age.com/cgi-bin/previews/preview.pl?sys=nds&amp;game=suikoden_tierkreis |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 15, 2009 |title=Suikoden Tierkreis Preview |date=February 11, 2009 |publisher=Gaming Age |accessdate=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The game is set in a world with several diverse nations and tribes and inhabited by a range of creatures including humans, Roar (similar to the Kobolds and Nay-Kobolds of previous games), Porpos-kin (small, penguin/dolphin like creatures), and Auster (a race of horned giants).

The game opens as the leader of 108 heroes engages the main antagonist known as "The One King" in battle. It is currently unknown whether the defeat shown in the introduction precedes the game or if the game is actually a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] leading to that scene. The game is set in a parallel world to the main world of the series, which is one of the many worlds in the Suikoden multiverse, known collectively as the Infinity.

The protagonist is an energetic young man from Citro Village who eventually ends up fighting a mysterious organization that preaches a [[fatalist]] philosophy in which the future is predetermined.

The concept of the Infinity has been previously explored in other Suikoden games: monsters from another dimension are summoned by [[Windy (Suikoden)|Windy]] and [[Leknaat]] in ''[[Suikoden (video game)|Suikoden I]]'', and by [[Luc (Suikoden)|Luc]] and [[List of Suikoden III characters|Sarah]] in ''[[Suikoden III]]''; [[Nash Latkje]], [[Humphrey Mintz]], and [[Futch]] visit ''The World of Wings and Scales'' in ''[[Gensō Suikogaiden|Suikogaiden II]]'', a parallel world where only dragons exist, while dragons are only able to exist in the main ''Suikoden'' world via the Dragon Rune, one of the 27 True Runes; the Fog Ship Guide, who appears in ''[[Suikoden IV]]'', hails from another world; and the final battle of ''[[Suikoden Tactics]]'' takes place in the ''World of Emptiness'', a parallel world from which monsters are summoned.  Additionally, it is implied that [[List of recurring characters in Suikoden|recurring characters]] Viki, Yuber, and Pesmerga likely come from parallel worlds.

==Characters==
{{main|List of characters in Suikoden Tierkreis}}

The player takes on the role of an unnamed character from Citro Village. Events in the game lead to the hero working to assemble the 108 heroes to oppose the powerful, cult-like society called The Order of the One True Way, which tries to force its principles on other nations under the mantra of "One World! One Future!" The leader of the Order intends to summon the being known as The One King with the power of the Chronicles, memories of different worlds, in hopes of becoming part of The One King's world, where everything is predetermined.

No characters from previous installments of the ''Suikoden'' series return for ''Tierkreis''.

==Development==
''Suikoden Tierkreis'' was directed by Osamu Komuta, who had previously served as a programmer in ''[[Suikoden IV]]'' and a planner in ''[[Suikoden Tactics]]''.  Kazuyoshi Tsugawa, who had penned ''[[Suikoden V]]'', also served as head writer.  Takahiro Sakiyama, the director of ''Suikoden V'', took part in this game's development as the lead planner.

The English version received "generally favorable reviews" according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=MC /&gt; [[IGN]] granted the game with an Editor's Choice award.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; Although the website found the game's overall presentation and production to be good, they felt longtime fans of the series may find it too different, commenting that "Suikoden Tierkreis may not be a pocket-sized representation of what hardcore series fans have grown to love, but it’s still one of the deepest and fully produced RPGs on the system, and a serious showpiece."&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;  Editors at ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' conversely found fault with the game's core gameplay and simple battle system, but still found it to have a good storytelling technique, remarking that "As much as [I] grumble about its flaws, Tierkreis's epic scope and engaging narrative did keep [me] playing, eager to see what would happen next."&lt;ref name="NP" /&gt;  [[GameSpot]] called the game "a brisk, beautiful role-playing experience", commenting on the game's "fantastic" visuals and music but panning the main character's "atrocious" English voice acting and lack of initial Wi-Fi support until the player is well into the game.&lt;ref name="GS" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3001">'''The Bear Club''' was an online community dedicated to [[teddy bears]].

==History==

'''The Bear Club''' was launched in July 2007 by two teachers and a writer from Derbyshire in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebearclub.co.uk/assets/files/teddy_bears-1.pdf Derby Evening Telegraph, 03.08.07, p26, Robin Johnson] {{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The site has been featured in a number of British and international press, including [[BBC Radio 1]], [[BBC Radio 2]],&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130505142527/http://thebearclub.co.uk/about.php The Bear Club website, About] &lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' Media Monkey,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2008/aug/21/teddybearolympics Guardian Media Monkey, 21.08.08]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Telegraph Online'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/howaboutthat/2603320/The-teddy-bear-Olympics.html The Telegraph Online, 21.08.08]&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the main sponsor for the past two years of the Taiwanese Teddy Bear Association (TWTBA) Teddy Bear Show &amp; Creative Awards.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

Taking its inspiration from the growing popularity of mainstream [[social networking]] sites, The Bear Club brought teddy bear ownership and collecting into the modern age and was a niche community which drew members from all age groups and from around the world.

==Clan leaders==

An integral part of joining The Bear Club was choosing to belong to one of the [[clans]].  There were eight clan leaders and each one was based on the eight species of wild [[bear]] - [[giant panda]] (Bai Bo), [[sun bear]] (Bruang), [[brown bear]] (Kodi), [[Asiatic black bear]] (Basindo), [[polar bear]] (Nanook), [[sloth bear]] (Aswail), [[spectacled bear]] (Buka) and [[American black bear|black bear]] (Kinamon).  Each clan leader has its own distinct character and all feature in The Bear Club's ongoing story, ''Tales From a Forgotten Room''.

==Membership==

Membership to The Bear Club was free, and like many of the mainstream social networking sites it generates income through [[advertising]] and [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] revenue. While there were two levels of membership, Silver and Gold, both were still free of cost. Once you applied, you were automatically given a Silver membership. As soon as you became an active member, through posting or updating your profile, you were given a Gold membership, which allowed access to the rest of the sites available features. 

==Teddy bear blogs==

Teddy bear [[blogs]] on the site typically include photographs of [[teddy bears]] on holiday, at home or in unusual places and are often accompanied by a blog entry as if written by the bear itself.

'''''The Hobbit''''' is an [[interactive fiction|illustrated text adventure]] computer game released in {{vgy|1982}} for the [[ZX Spectrum]] home computer and based on the book ''[[The Hobbit]]'', by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. It was developed at [[Beam Software]] by Philip Mitchell and Dr. Veronika Megler&lt;ref name=TheRegister&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.reghardware.com/2012/11/18/hobbit_author_veronika_megler_reminisces/ | title=Author of 80's classic The Hobbit didn't know game was a hit | publisher=The Register | date=2012-11-18 | author=Simon Sharwood | accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Original game packaging&lt;/ref&gt; and published by [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]]. It was later converted to most [[home computers]] available at the time including the [[Commodore 64]], [[BBC Micro]] and [[Oric]] computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Personal Computer Games|date=February 1984|issue=3|pages=4|url=https://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/PersonalComputerGames/Issue03/Pages/PersonalComputerGames0300004.jpg|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By arrangement with the book publishers, a copy of the book was included with each game sold.

The [[parsing|parser]] was very advanced for the time and used a subset of English called ''Inglish''.&lt;ref name="maher20121116"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.filfre.net/2012/11/the-hobbit/ | title=The Hobbit | work=The Digital Antiquarian | date=2012-11-16 | accessdate=10 October 2014 | author=Maher, Jimmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HobbitFandom"&gt;[http://playitagainproject.org/ruminations-on-the-hobbit-fandom/ Ruminations On "The Hobbit" Fandom] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010063858/http://playitagainproject.org/ruminations-on-the-hobbit-fandom/ |date=2014-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When it was released most adventure games used simple verb-noun parsers (allowing for simple phrases like 'get lamp'), but Inglish allowed one to type advanced sentences such as "ask [[Gandalf]] about the curious map then take sword and kill troll with it". The parser was complex and intuitive, introducing pronouns, adverbs ("viciously attack the goblin"), punctuation and prepositions and allowing the player to interact with the game world in ways not previously possible.

==Gameplay==
Many locations are illustrated by an image, based on originals designed by Kent Rees. On the tape version, to save space, each image was stored in a compressed format by storing outline information and then [[flood fill]]ing the enclosed areas on the screen.&lt;ref name="PGarrat"&gt;[https://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/ZXComputing/Issue8304/Pages/ZXComputing830400076.jpg "The Hobbit: Phil Garratt, after a brief sojourn in Middle Earth, takes time off to tell us what he found there"] Garratt, Phil (1983) ''ZX Computing'' issue 8304, page 76&lt;/ref&gt; The slow CPU speed meant that it would take up to several seconds for each scene to draw. The disk-based versions of the game used pre-rendered, higher-quality images.

The game has an innovative text-based physics system, developed by Veronika Megler.&lt;ref name="HobbitLady"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avventuretestuali.com/interviste/megler-eng/ | title=The Hobbit and his Lady | work=L'avventura è l'avventura | date=April 2002| accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects, including the characters in the game, have a calculated size, weight, and solidity. Objects can be placed inside other objects, attached together with rope and damaged or broken. If the main character is sitting in a barrel and this barrel is then picked up and thrown through a trapdoor, the player would go through.

Unlike other works of interactive fiction, the game is also in real time, insofar as a period of idleness causes the "WAIT" command to be automatically invoked and the possibility of events occurring as a result. This can be suppressed by entering the "PAUSE" command, which stops all events until a key is pressed.

The game has a cast of [[non-player characters]] (NPCs) entirely independent of the player and bound to precisely the same game rules. They have loyalties, strengths, and personalities that affect their behaviour and cannot always be predicted. The character of [[Gandalf]], for example, would roam freely around the game world (some fifty locations), picking up objects, getting into fights and being captured.

The volatility of the characters, coupled with the rich physics and impossible-to-predict fighting system, enabled the game to be played in many different ways, though this would also lead to problems (such as an important character being killed early on). There are numerous possible solutions and with hindsight, the game might be regarded as one of the first examples of [[emergent gameplay]]. This also resulted, however, in many bugs; for example, during development Megler found that the animal NPCs killed each other before the player arrived. The game's documentation warned that "Due to the immense size and complexity of this game it is impossible to guarantee that it will ever be completely error-free". Melbourne House issued a version 1.1 with some fixes, but with another bug that resulted in the game being [[unwinnable]], forcing it to release version 1.2, and the company never fixed all bugs.{{r|maher20121116}}

==Reception==
''The Hobbit'' was a bestseller in the UK on the ZX Spectrum in 1983&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Melbourne House Advertisement|journal=Sinclair User|date=April 1983|issue=13|pages=4|url=https://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/SinclairUser/Issue013/Pages/SinclairUser01300004.jpg|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both the C64 and BBC the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/C+VG/Issue028/Pages/CVG02800163.jpg "Chart Toppers"], [[C&amp;VG]] issue 28, page 163,&lt;/ref&gt; The game won the 1983 [[Golden Joystick Award]] for best strategy game.&lt;ref name="C&amp;VG"&gt;[https://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/C+VG/Issue029/Pages/CVG02900015.jpg "The Golden Joystick Award"], [[C&amp;VG]] issue 29, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; The game was also a huge commercial success, selling over 100,000 copies in its first two years at a retail price of £14.95.&lt;ref name="adventuring1984"&gt;[[Mike Gerrard]]: ''Adventuring into an Unknown World.'' In: The Guardian, 1984-08-30, section Micro Guardian/Futures, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no records of sales figures but in an article from March 1985 it was estimated in the range of 100,000 to 200,000&lt;ref&gt;[https://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/C+VG/Issue041/Supplement/CVG041Supplement06.jpg], [[C&amp;VG]] issue 41&lt;/ref&gt; and a figure of 500,000 copies is possible, making it an "excellent candidate for the bestselling text adventure of all time, challenged, if at all, only by Infocom’s ''[[Zork I]]''"{{r|maher20121116}}. The use of images on many of the locations as opposed to mostly text-only adventure games of the time, the flexibility of the ''Inglish'' parser, the innovative independence of the non-player characters, the popularity of Tolkien's work, all attributed to the game's phenomenal success.

To help players a book called "A guide to playing The Hobbit" by David Elkan was published in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;David Elkan: ''A Guide to Playing the Hobbit.'' Melbourne House, 1984, {{ISBN|0-86161-161-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developer Beam Software followed up ''The Hobbit'' with 1985's ''[[Lord of the Rings: Game One]]'', 1987's ''[[Shadows of Mordor|Shadows of Mordor: Game Two of Lord of the Rings]]'', and 1989's ''The Crack of Doom''. They would also reuse Inglish in "[[Sherlock (video game)|Sherlock]]".

In 1986 a parody of the game was released by [[CRL Group|CRL]], ''[[The Boggit]]''.

A phrase from the game which has entered [[popular culture]] is "Thorin sits down and starts singing about gold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell |first=Stuart |url=https://archive.org/stream/your-sinclair-72/YourSinclair_72_Dec_1991#page/n27/mode/2up |title= Top 100 Speccy Games |journal=[[Your Sinclair]] |issue= 72 |date= December 1991 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the game is mentioned in [[Nick Montfort]]'s, ''Twisty Little Passages'', a book exploring the history and form of the interactive fiction genre.

''[[Discworld Noir]]'' references ''The Hobbit'': when the protagonist, Lewton, discovers that someone concealed themselves in a wine barrel, he wonders why that brings to mind the phrases "You wait – time passes" and "Thorin sits down and starts singing about gold."

[[File:Cows on Selsley Common - geograph.org.uk - 192472.jpg|thumb|Cows on [[Selsley Common]]. The "tragedy of the commons" is one way of accounting for [[overexploitation]].]]

The '''tragedy of the commons''' is a term used in [[social science]] to describe a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action. The concept and phrase originated in an essay written in 1833 by the British economist [[William Forster Lloyd]], who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on [[common land]] (also known as a "common") in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name=forster&gt;{{Cite book |title=Two lectures on the checks to population |last=Lloyd |first=William Forster |publisher=Oxford University |year=1833 |isbn= |location=England |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/twolecturesonch00lloygoog |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept became widely known over a century later due to an article written by the American ecologist and philosopher [[Garrett Hardin]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=hardin68 /&gt;  In this modern economic context, [[commons]] is taken to mean any shared and unregulated resource such as [[Carbon dioxide#In the Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[Great Pacific garbage patch|oceans]], [[river|rivers]], [[fish stocks]], or even an office refrigerator.

It has been argued {{By whom|date=September 2018}} that the very term 'tragedy of the Commons' is a misnomer, since 'the commons' referred to land resources with rights jointly owned by members of a community, and no individual outside the community had any access to the resource. However, the term is now used in social science and economics when describing a problem where ''all'' individuals have equal and open access to a resource. Hence, 'tragedy of open access regimes' or simply 'the open access problem' are more apt terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Daly |first1=Herman E. |last2=Farley |first2=Joshua |authorlink1=Herman Daly |date=2011 |title=Ecological Economics.

The 'tragedy of the commons' is often cited in connection with [[sustainable development]], meshing economic growth and environmental protection, as well as in the [[Global warming controversy|debate over global warming]]. It has also been used in analyzing behavior in the fields of [[economics]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[game theory]], [[politics]], [[taxation]] and [[sociology]].

Although common resource systems have been known to collapse due to overuse (such as in [[over-fishing]]), many examples have existed and still do exist where members of a community with access to a common resource co-operate or regulate to exploit those resources prudently without collapse.&lt;ref name="Robert Wade 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Management|first1=National Research Council (U S. ) Panel on Common Property Resource|title=Proceedings of the Conference on Common Property Resource Management, April 21-26, 1985|date=1986|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cCkrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=Common+property+resource+management+in+South+Indian+Villages#v=onepage&amp;q=Common%20property%20resource%20management%20in%20South%20Indian%20Villages&amp;f=false|publisher=National Academies|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dlc.dlib.indiana.edu"&gt;Susan Jane Buck Cox - "No tragedy on the Commons" ''Journal of Environmental Ethics'', Vol 7, Spring 1985 [http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3113/buck_NoTragedy.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elinor Ostrom]] was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for demonstrating exactly this concept in her book Governing the Commons, which included examples of how local communities were able to do this without top-down regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2009/ostrom-facts.html|title=Elinor Ostrom - Facts|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lloyd's pamphlet===
In 1833, the English economist [[William Forster Lloyd]] published a pamphlet which included a hypothetical example of over-use of a common resource. This was the situation of cattle herders sharing a common parcel of land on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze, as was the custom in English villages. He postulated that if a herder put more than his allotted number of cattle on the common, [[overgrazing]] could result. For each additional animal, a herder could receive additional benefits, but the whole group shared damage to the commons. If all herders made this individually rational economic decision, the common could be depleted or even destroyed, to the detriment of all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lloyd |first=William Forster |title=Two Lectures on Population |year=1833 |jstor=1972412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, [[ecology|ecologist]] [[Garrett Hardin]] explored this [[social dilemma]] in his article "The Tragedy of the Commons", published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1243–1248 |year=1968 |pmid=5699198 |pmc= |author1=Hardin |first1=G|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/162/3859/1243.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abstract: "The population problem has no technical solution; it requires a fundamental extension in morality".&lt;/ref&gt; The essay derived its title from the pamphlet by [[William Forster Lloyd|Lloyd]], which he cites, on the over-grazing of common land.

Hardin discussed problems that cannot be solved by technical means, as distinct from those with solutions that require "a change only in the techniques of the [[natural science]]s, demanding little or nothing in the way of change in [[Value (personal and cultural)|human values]] or ideas of [[morality]]". Hardin focused on human population growth, the use of the Earth's [[natural resource]]s, and the welfare state.&lt;ref name="Intolerable"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hardin |first=G. |authorlink=Garrett Hardin |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=162 |issue=3859 |date=1968-12-13 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/162/3859/1243.full.pdf |quote=it is the role of education to reveal to all the necessity of abandoning the freedom to breed. Only so, can we put an end to this aspect of the tragedy of the commons. |pages=1243–1248 |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |pmid=5699198 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardin argued that if individuals relied on themselves alone, and not on the relationship of society and man, then the number of children had by each family would not be of public concern. Parents breeding excessively would leave fewer descendants because they would be unable to provide for each child adequately. Such negative feedback is found in the animal kingdom.&lt;ref name="Intolerable" /&gt; Hardin said that if the children of improvident parents starved to death, if overbreeding was its own punishment, then there would be no public interest in controlling the breeding of families.&lt;ref name="Intolerable" /&gt; Hardin blamed the [[welfare state]] for allowing the tragedy of the commons; where the state provides for children and supports overbreeding as a fundamental human right, [[Malthusian catastrophe]] is inevitable. Consequently, in his article, Hardin lamented the following proposal from the [[United Nations]]:
{{quote|text= The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] describes the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society. [Article 16&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights |date=10 December 1948 |accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;] It follows that any choice and decision with regard to the size of the family must irrevocably rest with the family itself, and cannot be made by anyone else. |source= Statement on Population by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]&lt;ref name="U Thant Statement"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Levels and trends of contraceptive use as assessed in 2002 |publisher=United Nations Publications |last=United Nations. Dept. of Economic and Social Affairs. Population Division |quote=some have argued that it may be inferred from the rights to privacy, conscience, health and well-being set forth in various United Nation's conventions […] Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children (United Nations, 1968) |year=2004 |page=126 |isbn=978-92-1-151399-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNkRbI8EAJgC }}&lt;/ref&gt; |sign= [[U Thant]]}}

In addition, Hardin also pointed out the problem of individuals acting in rational self-interest by claiming that if all members in a group used common resources for their own gain and with no regard for others, all resources would still eventually be depleted. Overall, Hardin argued against relying on [[conscience]] as a means of policing commons, suggesting that this favors [[selfish]] individuals&amp;nbsp;– often known as [[free rider problem|free riders]]&amp;nbsp;– over those who are more altruistic.

In the context of avoiding [[over-exploitation]] of [[Common-pool resource|common resources]], Hardin concluded by restating [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s [[Maxim (saying)|maxim]] (which was quoted by [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]), "freedom is the recognition of necessity". He suggested that "freedom" completes the tragedy of the commons. By recognizing resources as commons in the first place, and by recognizing that, as such, they require management, Hardin believed that humans "can preserve and nurture other and more precious freedoms".

===The "Commons" as a modern resource concept===
Hardin's article was the start of the modern use of "Commons" as a term connoting a shared resource. As Frank van Laerhoven &amp; Elinor Ostrom have stated: "Prior to the publication of Hardin’s article on the tragedy of the commons (1968), titles containing the words 'the commons', 'common pool resources,' or 'common property' were very rare in the academic literature." They go on to say: "In 2002, Barrett and Mabry conducted a major survey of biologists to determine which publications in the twentieth century had become classic books or benchmark publications in biology. They report that Hardin’s 1968 article was the one having the greatest career impact on biologists and is the most frequently cited".&lt;ref&gt;Traditions and Trends in the Study of the Commons Frank van Laerhoven &amp; Elinor Ostrom International Journal of the Commons Vol 1, no 1 October 2007, pp. 3-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

===Metaphoric meaning===
Like Lloyd and [[Thomas Malthus]] before him, Hardin was primarily interested in the problem of [[Human overpopulation|human population growth]]. But in his essay, he also focused on the use of larger (though finite) resources such as the Earth's atmosphere and oceans, as well as pointing out the "negative commons" of pollution (i.e., instead of dealing with the deliberate privatization of a positive resource, a "negative commons" deals with the deliberate commonization of a negative cost, pollution).

As a [[metaphor]], the tragedy of the commons should not be taken too literally. The "tragedy" is not in the word's conventional or theatric sense, nor a condemnation of the processes that lead to it. Similarly, Hardin's use of "commons" has frequently been misunderstood, leading him to later remark that he should have titled his work "The Tragedy of the Unregulated Commons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2006/07/26/life/will-commons-sense-dawn-again-in-time/ |title=Will commons sense dawn again in time? &amp;#124; The Japan Times Online |publisher=Search.japantimes.co.jp |date=2006-07-26 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hardin |first=Garrett |title=Extensions of "The Tragedy of the Commons" |journal=Science |date=May 1, 1998 |volume=280 |issue=5364 |pages=682–683 |doi=10.1126/science.280.5364.682 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/280/5364/682.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metaphor illustrates the argument that free access and unrestricted demand for a finite resource ultimately reduces the resource through [[over-exploitation]], temporarily or permanently. This occurs because the benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals or groups, each of whom is motivated to maximize use of the resource to the point in which they become reliant on it, while the costs of the exploitation are borne by all those to whom the resource is available (which may be a wider class of individuals than those who are exploiting it). This, in turn, causes demand for the resource to increase, which causes the problem to snowball until the resource collapses (even if it retains a capacity to recover). The rate at which depletion of the resource is realized depends primarily on three factors: the number of users wanting to consume the common in question, the consumptiveness of their uses, and the relative robustness of the common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=1227745 |title=Brigham Daniels, Emerging Commons Tragic Institutions |journal=Environmental Law |volume=37 |date=2007 |pages=515–571 at 536 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same concept is sometimes called the "tragedy of the fishers", because fishing too many fish before or during breeding could cause stocks to plummet.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Bowles: Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution, [[Princeton University Press]], pp. 27–29 (2004) {{ISBN|0-691-09163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern commons===
The ''tragedy of the commons'' can be considered in relation to environmental issues such as [[sustainability]]. The commons dilemma stands as a model for a great variety of resource problems in society today, such as water, forests,&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Andersson [http://wildfirenews.com/oregon "Tragedy of the Common Forest"] Oregon Daily Emerald&lt;/ref&gt; fish, and [[non-renewable energy]] sources such as oil and coal.

Situations exemplifying the "tragedy of the commons" include the overfishing and destruction of the [[Grand Banks]], the destruction of [[salmon]] runs on rivers that have been dammed – most prominently in modern times on the [[Columbia River]] in the [[Northwest United States]], and historically in [[North Atlantic]] rivers – the devastation of the sturgeon fishery – in modern Russia, but historically in the United States as well – and, in terms of water supply, the limited water available in arid regions (e.g., the area of the [[Aral Sea]]) and the [[Los Angeles]] water system supply, especially at [[Mono Lake]] and [[Owens Lake]].

In economics, an [[externality]] is a cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit.  Negative externalities are a well-known feature of the "tragedy of the commons".  For example, driving cars has many negative externalities; these include [[pollution]], [[carbon emissions]], and traffic accidents. Every time 'Person A' gets in a car, it becomes more likely that 'Person Z'{{spaced ndash}} and millions of others{{spaced ndash}} will suffer in each of those areas.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Dunber and Steven D. Levitt [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/magazine/20wwln-freakonomics-t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin "Not-So-Free-Ride"] The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;  Economists often urge the government to adopt policies that "internalize" an externality.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, William. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uhBkp5rmrXgC&amp;pg=PA80 Environmental Economics for Tree Huggers and Other Skeptics]'', p. 80 (Island Press 2012): "Economists often say that externalities need to be 'internalized,' meaning that some action needs to be taken to correct this kind of market failure."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application to evolutionary biology===
A parallel was drawn recently between the tragedy of the commons and the competing behaviour of parasites that through acting selfishly eventually diminish or destroy their common host.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000452/http://eao.igc.gulbenkian.pt/ENS/dionisio_evol_econ_rivalry_excludability.pdf The tragedy of the commons, the public goods dilemma, and the meaning of rivalry and excludability in evolutionary biology] ''Francisco Dionisio and Isabel Gordo'' Evolutionary Ecology Research 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has also been applied to areas such as the evolution of [[virulence]] or [[sexual conflict]], where males may fatally harm females when competing for matings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kokkonuts.org/wp-content/uploads/Sexdeathtragedy.pdf Sex, death and tragedy] ''Daniel J.

==Commons dilemma==
{{anchor|The Commons Dilemma}}
The ''commons dilemma'' is a specific class of [[social dilemma]] in which people's short-term selfish interests are at odds with long-term group interests and the [[common good]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Druzin |first=Bryan |title=A Plan to strengthen the Paris Agreement |url=https://works.bepress.com/bryan_druzin/18/ |journal=Fordham Law Review |volume=84 |pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In academia, a range of related terminology has also been used as shorthand for the theory or aspects of it, including ''resource dilemma'', ''take-some dilemma'', and ''[[common pool resource]]''.

Commons dilemma researchers have studied conditions under which groups and communities are likely to under- or [[over-harvest]] common resources in both the laboratory and field. Research programs have concentrated on a number of motivational, strategic, and structural factors that might be conducive to management of commons.

In [[game theory]], which constructs mathematical models for individuals' behavior in strategic situations, the corresponding "game", developed by Hardin, is known as the Commonize Costs&amp;nbsp;– Privatize Profits Game ([[CC–PP game]]).

===Psychological factors===
Kopelman, Weber, &amp; Messick (2002), in a review of the experimental research on cooperation in commons dilemmas, identify nine classes of independent variables that influence cooperation in commons dilemmas: social motives, gender, payoff structure, uncertainty, power and status, group size, communication, causes, and frames. They organize these classes and distinguish between psychological individual differences (stable personality traits) and situational factors (the environment). Situational factors include both the task (social and decision structure) and the perception of the task.&lt;ref&gt;Kopelman, Weber, &amp; Messick, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirical findings support the theoretical argument that the cultural group is a critical factor that needs to be studied in the context of situational variables.&lt;ref&gt;Gelfand &amp; Dyer, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than behaving in line with economic incentives, people are likely to approach the decision to cooperate with an appropriateness framework.&lt;ref&gt;Weber et al., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; An expanded, four factor model of the Logic of Appropriateness,&lt;ref&gt;Kopelman, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myers &amp; Kopelman, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the cooperation is better explained by the question: "What does a person like me (identity) do (rules) in a situation like this (recognition) given this culture (group)?"

===Strategic factors===
[[Strategy|Strategic]] factors also matter in commons dilemmas. One often-studied strategic factor is the order in which people take harvests from the resource. In simultaneous play, all people harvest at the same time, whereas in sequential play people harvest from the pool according to a predetermined sequence&amp;nbsp;– first, second, third, etc. There is a clear order effect in the latter games: the harvests of those who come first&amp;nbsp;– the leaders&amp;nbsp;– are higher than the harvest of those coming later&amp;nbsp;– the followers. The interpretation of this effect is that the first players feel entitled to take more. With sequential play, individuals adopt a first come-first served rule, whereas with simultaneous play people may adopt an equality rule. Another strategic factor is the ability to build up reputations. Research {{By whom|date=December 2011}} found that people take less from the common pool in public situations than in anonymous private situations. Moreover, those who harvest less gain greater prestige and influence within their group.

===Structural factors===
Much research has focused on when and why people would like to structurally rearrange the commons to prevent a tragedy. Hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of the commons that "Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all."&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, 1244&lt;/ref&gt; One of the proposed solutions is to appoint a leader to regulate access to the common. Groups are more likely to endorse a leader when a common resource is being depleted and when managing a common resource is perceived as a difficult task. Groups prefer leaders who are elected, democratic, and prototypical of the group, and these leader types are more successful in enforcing cooperation. A general aversion to autocratic [[leadership]] exists, although it may be an effective solution, possibly because of the fear of power abuse and corruption.

The provision of rewards and punishments may also be effective in preserving common resources. Selective punishments for overuse can be effective in promoting domestic water and energy conservation&amp;nbsp;– for example, through installing water and electricity meters in houses. Selective rewards work, provided that they are open to everyone. An experimental carpool lane in the Netherlands failed because car commuters did not feel they were able to organize a carpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Vugt |first=M. |last2=van Lange |first2=P.

==Solutions==
{{see also|Externality#Possible solutions}}
Articulating solutions to the tragedy of the commons is one of the main problems of [[political philosophy]]. In many situations, locals implement (often complex) social schemes that work well. The best governmental solution may be to do nothing. When these fail, there are many possible governmental solutions such as privatization, internalizing the externalities, and regulation.

===Non-governmental solution===
Sometimes the best governmental solution may be to do nothing. [[Robert Axelrod]] contends that even self-interested individuals will often find ways to cooperate, because collective restraint serves both the collective and individual interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Axelrod |first=Robert |year=1984 |title=The Evolution of Cooperation |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02121-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NJZBCGbNs98C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist G. N. Appell criticized those who cited Hardin to "impos[e] their own economic and environmental rationality on other social systems of which they have incomplete understanding and knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Appell, G. N. (1993). [http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/handle/10535/4532 Hardin's Myth of the Commons: The Tragedy of Conceptual Confusions]. Working Paper 8. Phillips, ME: Social Transformation and Adaptation Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist [[Elinor Ostrom]], who was awarded 2009's [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] for her work on the issue, and others revisited Hardin's work in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ostrom |first1=Elinor |last2=Burger |first2=Joanna |last3=Field |first3=Christopher B. |last4=Norgaard |first4=Richard B. |last5=Policansky |first5=David |year=1999 |title=Revisiting the Commons: Local Lessons, Global Challenges |url= http://dusk2.geo.orst.edu/prosem/Ostrom_etal1999.pdf|journal=Science |volume=284 |issue= 5412|pages=278–282 |doi=10.1126/science.284.5412.278 |pmid=10195886|format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; They found the tragedy of the commons not as prevalent or as difficult to solve as Hardin maintained, since locals have often come up with solutions to the commons problem themselves.&lt;ref name="urlOstrom revisits the commons in Science"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iuinfo.indiana.edu/HomePages/041699/text/ostrom.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182446/http://www.iuinfo.indiana.edu/HomePages/041699/text/ostrom.htm |archivedate=2012-03-05 |title=Ostrom 'revisits the commons' in 'Science' |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it was found that a commons in the Swiss Alps has been run by a collective of farmers there to their mutual and individual benefit since 1517, in spite of the farmers also having access to their own farmland. In general, it is in the users of a commons interests to keep the common running and complex social schemes are often invented by the users for maintaining them at optimum efficiency.&lt;ref name=beyond /&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/10/12/elinor-ostrom-commons-nobel-economics-opinions-contributors-vernon-l-smith.html|title=Governing The Commons|first=Vernon L.|last=Smith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, geographer Douglas L. Johnson remarks that many [[nomadic pastoralism|nomadic pastoralist]] societies of Africa and the Middle East in fact "balanced local stocking ratios against seasonal rangeland conditions in ways that were ecologically sound", reflecting a desire for lower risk rather than higher profit; in spite of this, it was often the case that "the nomad was blamed for problems that were not of his own making and were a product of alien forces."&lt;ref name="johnson1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Douglas L. |date=1993 |title=Nomadism and Desertification in Africa and the Middle East |journal=GeoJournal |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=51–66 |url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/382/art%253A10.1007%252FBF00815903.pdf?auth66=1421130745_ae3711f8ec80384f3be245bd003e8be5&amp;ext=.pdf |doi=10.1007/bf00815903}}{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independently finding precedent in the opinions of previous scholars such as [[Ibn Khaldun]] as well as common currency in antagonistic cultural attitudes towards non-sedentary peoples,&lt;ref name="johnson1993" /&gt; governments and international organizations have made use of Hardin's work to help justify restrictions on land access and the eventual [[sedentarization]] of pastoral nomads despite its weak empirical basis. Examining relations between historically nomadic [[Bedouin]] Arabs and the [[Syria]]n state in the 20th century, [[Dawn Chatty]] notes that "Hardin's argument […] was curiously accepted as the fundamental explanation for the degradation of the [[steppe]] land" in development schemes for the arid interior of the country, downplaying the larger role of agricultural [[overexploitation]] in [[desertification]] as it melded with prevailing nationalist ideology which viewed nomads as socially backward and economically harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chatty |first=Dawn |date=2010 |title=The Bedouin in Contemporary Syria: The Persistence of Tribal Authority and Control |journal=Middle East Journal |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=29–69 |url=https://www.academia.edu/4240985/Tribes_of_Syria |doi=10.3751/64.1.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elinor Ostrom]], and her colleagues looked at how real-world communities manage communal resources, such as fisheries, land irrigation systems, and farmlands, and they identified a number of factors conducive to successful resource management. One factor is the resource itself; resources with definable boundaries (e.g., land) can be preserved much more easily. A second factor is resource dependence; there must be a perceptible threat of resource depletion, and it must be difficult to find substitutes. The third is the presence of a community; small and stable populations with a thick social network and social norms promoting conservation do better.&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;Elinor Ostrom: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByXM47Ri1Kc ''Beyond the tragedy of commons'']. Stockholm whiteboard seminars. (Video, 8:26 min.)&lt;/ref&gt; A final condition is that there be appropriate community-based rules and procedures in place with built-in incentives for responsible use and punishments for overuse. When the commons is taken over by non-locals, those solutions can no longer be used.&lt;ref name="urlOstrom revisits the commons in Science" /&gt;

===Governmental solutions===
Governmental solutions may be necessary when the above conditions are not met (such as a community being too big or too unstable to provide a thick social network). Examples of government regulation include privatization, regulation, and internalizing the externalities.

====Privatization====
One solution for some resources is to convert common good into private property, giving the new owner an incentive to enforce its sustainability. [[libertarianism|Libertarians]] and [[classical liberalism|classical liberals]] cite the tragedy of the commons as an example of what happens when [[John Locke|Lockean]] property rights to homestead resources are prohibited by a government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Robert J. |last=Smith |title=Resolving the Tragedy of the Commons by Creating Private Property Rights in Wildlife |url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/1981/11/cj1n2-7.pdf |publisher=[[Cato Institute]] |series=[[Cato Journal]] |volume=1 |issue=2 |date=Fall 1981 |pages=439–468}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the solution to the tragedy of the commons is to allow individuals to take over the property rights of a resource, that is, to privatize it.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Locke]], "Sect. 27" and following sections in [https://web.archive.org/web/20070304114414/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/locke/locke2/locke2nd-a.html#Sect.%2025.#Sect.%2027. ''Second Treatise of Government''] (1690). Also available [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7370 here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, this solution was attempted in the [[Inclosure Acts]].

====Regulation====
In a typical example, governmental regulations can limit the amount of a common good that is available for use by any individual. Permit systems for extractive economic activities including mining, fishing, hunting, livestock raising and timber extraction are examples of this approach. Similarly, limits to pollution are examples of governmental intervention on behalf of the commons. This idea is used by the [[United Nations]] [[Moon Treaty]], [[Outer Space Treaty]] and [[Law of the Sea Treaty]] as well as the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Convention]] which involves the international law principle that designates some areas or resources the [[Common Heritage of Mankind]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Frakes, The Common Heritage of Mankind Principle and the Deep Seabed, Outer Space, and Antarctica: Will Developed and Developing Nations Reach a Compromise? Wisconsin International Law Journal. 2003; 21:409&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hardin's essay, he proposed that the solution to the problem of overpopulation must be based on "mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon" and result in "relinquishing the freedom to breed". Hardin discussed this topic further in a 1979 book, ''Managing the Commons,'' co-written with [[John A. Baden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecobooks.com/books/commons.htm |title=Managing the Commons by Garrett Hardin and John Baden |publisher=Ecobooks.com |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He framed this prescription in terms of needing to restrict the "[[reproductive rights|reproductive right]]", to safeguard all other [[rights]]. Several countries have a variety of [[Antinatalistic politics|population control laws]] in place.

German historian [[Joachim Radkau]] thought Hardin advocates strict management of common goods via increased government involvement or international regulation bodies.&lt;ref name="Rad"&gt;Radkau, Joachim. Nature and Power. A Global History of the Environment. Cambridge University Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An asserted impending "tragedy of the commons" is frequently warned of as a consequence of the adoption of policies which restrict [[Property#Theories of property|private property]] and espouse expansion of public property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |authorlink=Natalia Mirovitskaya, Marvin S.

====Internalizing externalities====
Privatization works when the person who owns the property (or rights of access to that property) pays the full price of its exploitation. As discussed above negative externalities (negative results, such as air or water pollution, that do not proportionately affect the user of the resource) is often a feature driving the tragedy of the commons. ''Internalizing the externalities'', in other words ensuring that the users of resource pay for all of the consequences of its use, can provide an alternate solution between privatization and regulation. One example is gasoline taxes which are intended to include both the cost of road maintenance and of air pollution. This solution can provide the flexibility of privatization while minimizing the amount of government oversight and overhead that is needed.

==Criticism==
The environmentalist [[Derrick Jensen]] claims the tragedy of the commons is used as [[propaganda]] for [[private ownership]].&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Derrick (2007), "Endame Vol 1: The Problem of Civilisation" and "Endame Vol II: Resistance" (Seven Stories Press)&lt;/ref&gt;  He says it has been used by the political [[right wing]] to hasten the final enclosure of the "common resources" of [[third world]] and indigenous people worldwide, as a part of the [[Washington Consensus]].  He argues that in true situations, those who abuse the commons would have been warned to desist and if they failed would have punitive sanctions against them.  He says that rather than being called "The Tragedy of the Commons", it should be called "the Tragedy of the Failure of the Commons".

Hardin's work was also criticised&lt;ref name="urlwww.econ.cam.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/faculty/dasgupta/ |authorlink=Partha Dasgupta |first=Partha |last=Dasgupta |title=Human Well-Being and the Natural Environment |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; as historically inaccurate in failing to account for the [[demographic transition]], and for failing to distinguish between [[Common-pool resource|common property]] and [[Open access (infrastructure)|open access]] resources.&lt;ref name=Ciriacy&gt;Ciriacy-Wantrup S.V., Bishop R.C., 1975. "Common Property" as a Concept in Natural Resources Policy. Nat. Res. J. 15, 713–727&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Carl Dahlman argues that commons were effectively managed to prevent overgrazing.&lt;ref name="urlSpringerLink"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/wm68g57188j282u4/ |title= The tragedy of the commons that wasn't: On technical solutions to the institutions game|accessdate= | doi=10.1007/BF01357919 |volume=12 |issue= 3|year=1991 |journal=Population and Environment |pages=285–296 | last1 = Dahlman | first1 = Carl J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Susan Jane Buck Cox argues that the common land example used to argue this economic concept is on very weak historical ground, and misrepresents what she terms was actually the "triumph of the commons": the successful common usage of land for many centuries. She argues that social changes and agricultural innovation, and not the behaviour of the commoners, led to the demise of the commons.&lt;ref name="dlc.dlib.indiana.edu"/&gt; 

Some authors, like [[Yochai Benkler]], say that with the rise of the Internet and digitalisation, an economics system based on commons becomes possible again. He wrote in his book ''[[The Wealth of Networks]]'' in 2006 that cheap computing power plus networks enable people to produce valuable products through non-commercial processes of interaction: "as human beings and as social beings, rather than as market actors through the price system". He uses the term 'networked [[information economy]]' to describe a "system of production, distribution, and consumption of information goods characterized by decentralized individual action carried out through widely distributed, nonmarket means that do not depend on market strategies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Benkler, Yochai |title=The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-300-11056-2 |oclc= |doi= |page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0Q0mAEACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also coined the term '[[commons-based peer production]]' to describe collaborative efforts based on sharing information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Steven Johnson (author)|Steven Johnson]] |coauthors= |title=The Internet? We Built That |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/magazine/the-internet-we-built-that.html?src=dayp |quote=The Harvard legal scholar Yochai Benkler has called this phenomenon 'commons-based peer production'. |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=September 21, 2012 |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of commons-based peer production are [[free and open source software]] and [[open-source hardware]].

==Comedy of the commons==
In certain cases, exploiting a resource more may be a good thing. Carol M. Rose, in a 1986 article, discussed the concept of the "comedy of the commons", where the public property in question exhibits "increasing returns to scale" in usage (hence the phrase, "the more the merrier"), in that the more people use the resource, the higher the benefit to each one. Rose cites as examples commerce and group recreational activities. According to Rose, public resources with the "comedic" characteristic may suffer from under-investment rather than over usage.&lt;ref name="rose"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2827&amp;context=fss_papers |title=The Comedy of the Commons: Commerce, Custom, and Inherently Public Property |author=Rose, Carol M. |journal=Faculty Scholarship Series, Yale Law School |year=1986 |volume=Paper 1828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Un Argentino en New York''''' (international, [[English language|English]] title: '''''An Argentine in New York''''') is a [[1998 in film|1998]] [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[film]] directed by [[Juan José Jusid]] and starring [[Guillermo Francella]] and [[Natalia Oreiro]]. It is the story of an Argentine adolescent girl who travels to [[New York City|New York]], and decides to stay and live there. Her father makes the decision to go to New York, a place where he has never been, to meet his daughter and try to bring her back to [[Buenos Aires]]. During his journey he’ll discover that his daughter has grown, formed a music band and met an [[United States|American]] man who she loves.

==Plot==
''Un Argentino en New York'' tells us the story of Franco Ricci ([[Guillermo Francella]]) and his daughter Veronica ([[Natalia Oreiro]]). Franco is a [[porteño]] who is very sentimental, a musician, separated and with a couple of dreams. Veronica, a brave young girl, attractive and intelligent, who always obtains what she wants.

While Veronica was traveling through New York, she surprisingly decided to stay and live in the city. When Franco, her father, hears the news, he decides to travel and pay her a visit with the goal of bringing her back to [[Argentina]].

Even though it’s hard for Franco to admit it, he’ll discover that in the past months Veronica has grown and is more mature. She has formed a music band called ''The Verónikos'', they debuted in a café and they have shown that they could succeed in the music industry. She has also fallen in love of an [[United States|American]] boy, which will bring jealousy to her father.

The movie takes place in [[New York City|New York]], a vertiginous city and unknown to Franco, which will bring all different types of hilarious adventures. After the whole journey through [[Manhattan]], it will bring all sorts of feelings between father and daughter, which will change their lives.

Between laughs and tears, ''Un Argentino en New York'' shares with us the journey in which a father realizes that her daughter is no longer a teenager, and has turned into a woman.
