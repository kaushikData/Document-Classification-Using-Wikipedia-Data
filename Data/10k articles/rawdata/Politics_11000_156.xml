      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3663">{{About|the political rallying cry|the Italian extra-parliamentary organization|Lotta Continua|the album by [[Big Youth]]|A Luta Continua (The Struggle Continue)}}

'''''A luta continua''''' (in [[English language|English]]: ''the struggle continues'') was the rallying cry of the [[FRELIMO]] movement during [[Mozambique]]’s [[Mozambican War of Independence|war for independence]]. The phrase is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (the official language of the former Portuguese colony) and was used by FRELIMO leader [[Samora Machel]] to cultivate popular support against the Portuguese colonial presence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4619939.stm "Mozambique celebrates costly freedom" BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;

Machel became the first president of an independent Mozambique in 1975 and continued to use the phrase ''a luta continua'' as an unofficial national motto. Posters bearing the phrase can still be found on the walls of [[Maputo]], the nation’s capital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/19/world/mozambique-rethinking-its-dreams.html “Mozambique rethinking its dreams” New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/dailynews/columnists/bernard_fernandez/20070121_inq_travel_TR1MAP.html Mozambique]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in popular media==
The phrase has also been used as the title of a 1971 film on the struggle for Mozambican independence&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200709280457.html “A luta continua” AllAfrica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and as the title of a Mozambique-inspired song popularized by South African singer [[Miriam Makeba]] and written for her by her daughter [[Bongi Makeba|Bongi]] after she attended the independence ceremony of Mozambique in 1975&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE_XSfjSFTw "A Luta Continua on VARA television, 1979"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/558/profile.htm “Mama Africa” Weekly Al-Ahram] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506235510/http://www.weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/558/profile.htm |date=May 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then released on the album ''[[Welela]]'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/12/arts/home-entertanment-recordings-recent-releases.html "New York Times Review"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the phrase appears at the end of the final credits of four films directed by [[Jonathan Demme]]:
* ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'' (1993)
* ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991)
* ''[[Married to the Mob]]'' (1988)
* ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]'' (1986)

==Use by activist movements==

The phrase appeared on T-shirts worn by [[LGBT rights]] activists at the funeral of [[David Kato]] in [[Uganda]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE70R0HS20110128?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0|title = Scuffles at funeral of Uganda gay activist|publisher = Reuters|date = Jan 28, 2011 &lt;!-- 3:21pm GMT --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A luta continua is also widely used in [[Nigeria]] by students and activists. Protests, riots, and other actions to demand for the rights of Nigerian students are termed as "Aluta". It is the motto of the all-Nigerian Students Union across all academic institutions of higher education. It is generally given in full: "A luta continua; a vitória é certa", meaning "The struggle continues; victory is certain".

Increased usage of the term has also been noted during the 2016 South African [[Fees Must Fall]] protests.

'''Anova–Nationalist Brotherhood''' ({{lang-gl|ANOVA–Irmandade Nacionalista, '''Anova'''}}) is a political party of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. Formed in 2012, under the guidance of historical leader [[Xosé Manuel Beiras]], Anova was formed by [[Encontro Irmandiño]] (2012 split of the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc|BNG]]), the [[Galician People's Front|FPG]], [[Movemento pola Base]] (small 2009 split of the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc|BNG]]), the [[Galician Workers Front]] (2012 split of the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc|BNG]]) and independent militants. Anova defines itself as a [[galician nationalism|Galician nationalist]], [[socialism|socialist]], [[feminism|feminist]], [[Galician independence|Galician independentist]], [[ecologism|ecologist]] and [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] organization. Its internal organization is run by assemblies.

==History==
To contest the [[Galician parliamentary election, 2012|2012 Galician parliamentary election]], Anova decided to form a coalition with the [[United Left (Galicia)|United Left]], [[Equo]], and the [[Espazo Ecosocialista Galego]]. The coalition was called [[Galician Left Alternative]]; it won 9 seats (5 [[United Left (Galicia)|United Left]], 4 Anova), becoming the third-largest party in the [[Galician Parliament]], displacing the Galician Nationalist Bloc, and coming second in most of the major cities of Galicia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.es/elecciones/gallegas/2012/abci-beiras-irrumpe-parlamento-201210211434.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 a critical political organization within the party, called [[Cerna (political organization)|CERNA]], was created. CERNA left the party after the results of the second National Assembly of Anova.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.galiciahoxe.com/vivir-hoxe-galicia/gh/criticos-anova-constituense-nun-grupo-chamado-cerna-piden-un-cambio-radical/idEdicion-2014-06-29/idNoticia-877436/|title=Os críticos de Anova constitúense nun grupo chamado 'Cerna' e piden|last=Gallego|first=Grupo El Correo|website=Galicia Hoxe - Noticias en galego a diario|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.farodevigo.es/galicia/2014/10/27/militantes-cerna-anova-crearan-nueva/1120219.html|title=Los militantes de Cerna se van de Anova y crearán una nueva formación política|last=Vigo|first=Faro de|website=www.farodevigo.es|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brazilian Cultural Center''' ({{lang-pt|Centro Cultural Brasileiro}}, abbreviated '''CCB''') is an institution subordinated to the Brazilian diplomatic missions in each country, being the main instrument for the execution of the Brazilian cultural policy abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plusnews.org/pt/Report.aspx?ReportId=81074 São Tomé e Príncipe: Campanha com jeito de espetáculo, PlusNews news]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agencialusa.com.br/index.php?iden=818 Moçambicano assume centro cultural brasileiro em Maputo, Agência Lusa news]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly it was known as the '''Center of Brazilian Studies''' or '''Center for Brazilian Studies''' (''Centro de Estudos Brasileiros''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dc.mre.gov.br/box-02/lima-centro-cultural-brasil-peru dc.mre.gov.br] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719224903/http://www.dc.mre.gov.br/box-02/lima-centro-cultural-brasil-peru |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are Brazilian Cultural Centers currently in [[Angola]], [[Bolivia]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Guinea Bissau]], [[Guyana]], [[Haiti]], [[Italy]], [[Lebanon]], [[Mexico]], [[Mozambique]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[South Africa]], [[Spain]], [[Suriname]], the [[United States]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dc.mre.gov.br/lingua-e-literatura/centros-culturais-do-brasil# |title=Brazilian Cultural Centers directions, Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website |access-date=2010-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818161008/http://www.dc.mre.gov.br/lingua-e-literatura/centros-culturais-do-brasil# |archive-date=2010-08-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceb-barcelona.org/os_outros_cebs.htm Brazilian Cultural Centers directions, Brazilian Cultural Center Barcelona website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802025856/http://www.ceb-barcelona.org/os_outros_cebs.htm |date=August 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centers are also home to the [[CELPE-Bras]] exams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inep.gov.br/download/celpebras/2010/Postos_de_aplicacao.pdf Authorized institutions for the application of CELPE-Bras exams, as of 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Canada Health Act''''' ('''CHA''') ({{lang-fr|Loi canadienne sur la santé}}) (the ''Act'') is a piece of [[Government of Canada]] [[legislation]], adopted in 1984, which specifies the conditions and criteria with which the provincial and territorial [[health insurance]] programs must conform in order to receive federal [[transfer payment]]s under the [[Canada Health Transfer]]. These criteria require universal coverage of all insured services (for all "insured persons").&lt;ref name="chal9"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada Health Act, Section 9|publisher=Government of Canada|author=|date=1984-04-01|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-6/page-3.html#docCont|accessdate=2012-12-14|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Insured health services" include hospital services, physician services, and surgical-dental services provided to insured persons, if they are not otherwise covered, for example by provincial [[workers' compensation]] programmes.&lt;ref name="chal2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada Health Act, Section 2|publisher=Government of Canada|author=|date=1984-04-01|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-6/page-1.html#docCont|accessdate=2012-12-14|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Act'' deals only with how the system is financed. The act also deals with professional people like students.  Because of the constitutional division of powers among levels of government in [[Canadian federalism]], adherence to CHA conditions is voluntary. However, the fiscal levers have helped to ensure a relatively consistent level of coverage across the country. Although there are disputes as to the details, the ''Act'' remains highly popular.

In popular discussion, the ''Act'' is often conflated with the [[Health care in Canada|health care system]] in general. However, the ''Act'' is silent about how care should be organized and delivered, as long as its criteria are met. The ''Act'' states that "the primary objective of Canadian health care policy is to protect, promote and restore the physical and mental well-being of residents of Canada and to facilitate reasonable access to health services without financial or other barriers."&lt;ref name="chal3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada Health Act, Section 3|publisher=Government of Canada|author=|date=1984-04-01|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-6/page-2.html#docCont|accessdate=2012-12-14|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cause for debate is the scope of what should be included as "insured services". For historical reasons, the CHA's definition of insured services is largely restricted to care delivered in hospitals or by physicians. As care has moved from hospitals to home and community, it increasingly has been moving beyond the terms of the ''Act''. International data shows that approximately 70% of Canadian health expenditures are paid from public sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Canadian Institute for Health Information]]|date=September 27, 2005|title=CIHI exploring the 70-30 split|publisher=|url=https://secure.cihi.ca/estore/productSeries.htm?pc=PCC292|isbn=1-55392-655-2|accessdate=2010-12-15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; placing Canada below the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] average.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]|year=2010|title=OECD Health Data 2010: How Does Canada Compare|publisher=|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/33/38979719.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2010-12-15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, health insurance covers surgery and services, including psychotherapy, in clinics and doctors' offices as well as dental surgery at dental offices and laboratory tests.

==History: Federalism==
{{main|Canadian federalism}}
[[Canada]] is a [[Federalism|federal]] country in which power is distributed between the national government and the ten provinces. The division of power was spelled out in the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act 1867]]'' [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/index.html] (renamed the ''Constitution Act, 1867'' in 1982). Section 92(7) lists as one of the "exclusive powers of provincial legislatures" "The Establishment, Maintenance, and Management of Hospitals, Asylums, Charities, and Eleemosynary Institutions in and for the Province, other than Marine Hospitals."&lt;ref&gt;Canada, {{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/index.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2010-11-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605081725/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/index.html|archivedate=2010-12-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the mismatch between fiscal resources and fiscal capacity became increasingly problematic. If Canadians were to have similar levels of service, it would be necessary for the national government to somehow equalize the ability to pay for it. Yet attempts by the national government to implement programs directly encountered resistance from the provinces. This resulted in several legal battles. In a few cases, where there was agreement that the federal government should take the lead, adverse court decisions were handled by amending the constitution (e.g., in 1940, in response to a court decision that federal unemployment insurance was unconstitutional, the ''Constitution Act, 1867'' was amended to give the national Parliament jurisdiction over unemployment insurance).&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2005/2005scc56/2005scc56.html Reference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121041537/http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2005/2005scc56/2005scc56.html|date=November 21, 2007}} re Employment Insurance Act (Can.), ss. 22 and 23, 2005 SCC 56, [2005] 2 [[Supreme Court of Canada]] 669.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Constitution Act'' does give potential powers over elements of health care to the federal government through various clauses (e.g., quarantine), but the role of the federal government has been highly debated. As summarized by a Senate Committee led by Michael Kirby,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology|date=March 2001|title=The Health of Canadians – The Federal Role, Interim Report, Volume One – The Story So Far|publisher=Canada|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/com-e/pdf-e/interim-soci-e.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; the federal government has a number of roles to play, including assisting the provinces in paying for health services. Although this has not been tested in court, the federal government has assumed that it is entitled to use its spending powers to set national standards. However, the extent to which 'strings' can be (and are) attached to federal transfers has remained contentious, and most federal governments have been unwilling to antagonize the provinces.

===Health insurance before the CHA===
The development of Canadian health insurance [http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/hist/medicare/medic00e.shtml] has been well described by Malcolm Taylor, who participated in many of the negotiations in addition to studying it as an academic.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm G. Taylor. ''The Seven Decisions That Created the Canadian Health Insurance System and Their Outcomes''. Second edition. McGill-Queen's University Press, 1987. {{ISBN|978-0-7735-0629-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health care is delivered privately but largely administered and funded publicly by provinces, consistent with their jurisdictional authority. Funded privately until the mid-to-late 20th century, Taylor notes that many Canadians "daily faced the potentially catastrophic physical and financial consequence of unpredictable illness, accident, and disability," and providers, unwilling to deny needed care, had growing bad debts. A number of efforts to establish social insurance systems failed due to provincial opposition to federal incursion into their jurisdiction. These included the 1937 [[Rowell-Sirois Commission]] on Dominion-Provincial Relations, and the 1945 Green Book proposals of Prime Minister [[Mackenzie King]] as part of the post-World War II reconstruction. At the same time, Canada resembled other developed economies in its receptivity to a more expansive government role in improving [[Welfare state|social welfare]], particularly given the widespread sacrifices during [[World War II]] and the still active memories of the [[Great Depression]].

Following the collapse of the conference proposals in 1946, in 1947, the social democratic premier of [[Saskatchewan]], [[Tommy Douglas]] of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) established Canada's first publicly funded hospital insurance plan. Other provinces - including [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], and [[Ontario]], introduced their own insurance plans, with varying degrees of coverage, and varying degrees of success. When [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] joined Canada, it brought along its system of [[cottage hospital]]s. These policy initiatives increased pressure on the federal government, flush with post-war financial resources, to buy-in to health care both for its electoral appeal and to extend public financing to provinces whose citizens did not yet have full coverage for hospital care.

The federal government initially acted through its spending power; in 1948, it introduced a series of National Health Grants to directly provide funds to the provinces/territories for such purposes as hospital construction, professional training, and public health.  This increased the number of hospital beds but did not address the issue of how their operating costs would be covered.  The result was that the Progressive Conservative government of [[John Diefenbaker]], who also happened to represent Saskatchewan, introduced and passed (with all-party approval) the ''[[Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act]] of 1957''. This shared the costs of covering hospital services. By the start date (July 1, 1958) five provinces—Newfoundland, [[Manitoba]], Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia—had programs in place which could receive the federal funds. By January 1, 1961, when [[Quebec]] finally joined, all provinces had universal coverage for hospital care.

Saskatchewan decided to take the money released by the federal contributions to pioneer again, and following lengthy consultations with but also strong opposition from the provincial medical association, introduced a plan to insure physician costs (The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Plan). By this time, Douglas had moved to national politics, as leader of the federal New Democratic Party (NDP), The provincial plan precipitated a [[Saskatchewan doctors' strike|strike]] by the province's physicians (1962). It was eventually settled, but the CCF lost the 1964 election to Liberal Ross Thatcher. The plan, however, remained popular, and encouraged other provinces to examine similar programs. A policy debate ensued, with some arguing for universal coverage, and others (particularly the [[Canadian Medical Association]]) arguing for an emphasis on voluntary coverage, with the government assisting only those who could not afford the premiums. Three provinces - BC, Alberta, and Ontario - introduced such programs.

The federal reaction was to appoint a Royal Commission on Health Services. First announced by Prime Minister Diefenbaker in December 1960, it was activated in the following June. Its chair was [[Emmett Matthew Hall|Justice Emmett Hall]], the chief justice of Saskatchewan, and a lifelong friend of Mr. Diefenbaker. Three years later, following extensive hearings and deliberations, it released an influential report, which recommended that Canada establish agreements with all provinces to assist them in setting up comprehensive, universal programs for insuring medical services, on the Saskatchewan model, but also recommended adding coverage for prescription drugs, prosthetic services, home care services, as well as optical and dental services for children and those on public assistance. (None of these have yet been added to the formal national conditions, although most provinces do have some sort of coverage for these services.)

By this time, the Liberals, under [[Lester B. Pearson]] were in power. Following intense debate, the Pearson government introduced the ''Medical Care Act'' which was passed in 1966 by a vote of 177 to two. These two Acts established a formula whereby the federal government paid approximately 50% of approved expenditures for hospital and physician services. (The actual formula was a complex one, based on a combination of average national expenditures and spending by each province. In practice, this meant that higher-spending provinces received more federal money, but that it represented a lower proportion of their expenditures, and vice versa for lower-spending provinces.) By 1972, all provinces and territories had complying plans. However, the fiscal arrangements were seen as both cumbersome and inflexible. By 1977, a new fiscal regimen was in place.

===Change in fiscal arrangements: the 1977 act===
In 1977, HIDS, the ''Medical Care Act'', and federal funds for post-secondary education (also under provincial jurisdiction) were combined into a new ''Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements and Established Programs Financing Act of 1977'' (known as EPF). This legislation de-coupled the legislation governing the amount of the federal transfer from the legislation establishing the terms and conditions to be met to receive it.

Under this new arrangement, cost sharing was no more. Provinces/territories now had more flexibility, as long as the federal terms and conditions continued to be met.  The federal government had more predictability. Rather than an open-ended commitment, EPF established a per capita entitlement (not adjusted for age-sex or other demographic factors) which would be indexed to inflation. This money would go into provincial general revenues. To simplify a complex formula, the EPF entitlement could be seen as consisting of two components. Part of the funds were in the form of "tax transfers" whereby "the federal government agreed with provincial and territorial governments to reduce its personal and corporate income tax rates, thus allowing them to raise their tax rates by the same amount. As a result, revenue that would have flowed to the federal government began to flow directly to provincial and territorial governments."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Health Canada]]|year=2002|title=The Canada Health and Social Transfer|publisher=Canada|url= http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/2002/2002_care-soinsbk1_e.html|accessdate=2007-12-26|format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AThe+Canada+Health+and+Social+Transfer&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2002&amp;as_yhi=2002&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218032141/http://hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/2002/2002_care-soinsbk1_e.html|archivedate=December 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transfer could not be reversed by subsequent governments, meaning that the federal government had no fiscal leverage over this component of the transfer. (Indeed, there has been an ongoing controversy as to whether this component should even be considered part of the federal contribution.)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Raisa Deber|date=July 11, 2000|title=Who Wants To Pay For Health Care|volume=163|issue=1|journal=[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/163/1/43|accessdate=2007-12-26|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of the entitlement was in the form of cash grants. Although the per capita amount was intended to be escalated to inflation, subsequently, the federal government tried to deal with its fiscal position by unilaterally first reducing and then freezing the inflation escalator. As the cash portion threatened to disappear, in 1996, the federal government combined the EPF transfers with another cost-shared program, the Canada Assistance Plan (CAP), to form the [[Canada Health and Social Transfer]] (CHST). This enabled the federal government to both cut the total transfers (by approximately the amount in the CAP) while retaining a 'cash floor' on the total amount. In 2004, these transfers were split into the Canada Health Transfer (CHT) and the Canada Social Transfer. The federal Department of Finance publishes brief guides to these programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Department of Finance|url=http://www.fin.gc.ca/FEDPROV/hise.html|title=A Brief History of the Health and Social Transfers|work=Federal provincial cost sharing programs|publisher=Canada|accessdate=2007-12-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217155935/http://www.fin.gc.ca/FEDPROV/hise.html|archivedate=2007-12-17|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, many argue that there has been no explicit federal transfer for health care since 1977, since these programs are no longer tied to specific spending.

The second component of the federal plan, specification of the terms and conditions which provincial/territorial insurance plans must meet, continued to be those established in HIDS and the Medical Care Act. (Note that there were almost no conditions attached to the CAP or post-secondary education components of the transfers.) The genesis of the CHA was recognition of the extent to which the federal ability to control provincial behaviour had been reduced. One particular problem was the absence of any provision for graduated withholding of the federal contribution. Because there was little desire to withhold the full contribution for minor violations of terms and conditions, provinces increasingly were permitting extra billing for insured services. In response to the resulting political uproar, the federal government again turned to [[Emmett Matthew Hall|Justice Emmett Hall]] and asked him to report on the future of medicare. His 1979 report, 'Canada's National-Provincial Health Program for the 1980s' noted some of the areas recommended in his earlier report which had not yet been acted on, and warned that accessibility to health care was being threatened through rising user fees. The federal response was to pass the 1984 ''Canada Health Act'' which replaced both HIDS and the Medical Care Act and clarified the federal conditions.

==The 1984 act==
On December 12, 1983, the ''Canada Health Act'' was introduced by the Liberal government, under [[Pierre Trudeau|Trudeau]], spearheaded by then Minister of Health [[Monique Bégin]]. As she noted, the government decided not to expand coverage (e.g., to mental health and public health), but instead to incorporate much of the language from the HIDS and Medical Care Acts.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Begin. Medicare: Canada's Right to Health. 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-88890-219-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Canada Health Act'' was passed unanimously by Parliament in 1984, and received Royal Assent on 1 April. Following election of a Conservative government under [[Brian Mulroney]] in September 1984, in June 1985, after consultation with the provinces, new federal Health Minister [[Jake Epp]] wrote a letter to his provincial counterparts that clarified and interpreted the criteria points and other parts of the new act.

===Key features of the CHA===
The [[preamble]] of the ''Act'' states that the objective of [[Health care in Canada|Canadian Health Care policy]] is "that continued access to quality health care without financial or other barriers will be critical to maintaining and improving the health and well-being of Canadians. The primary objective of the ''Act'' is "to protect, promote and restore the physical and mental well-being of residents of Canada and to facilitate reasonable access to health services without financial or other barriers." (Section 3).

To do so, the ''Act'' lists a set of criteria and conditions that the provinces must follow in order to receive their federal transfer payments: Public administration, Comprehensiveness, Universality, Portability, and Accessibility. There is also a requirement that the provinces ensure recognition of the federal payments and provide information to the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/2002/2002_care-soinsbk4_e.html|title=Canada Health Act Overview, 2002|accessdate=2007-12-26|author=[[Health Canada]]|date=November 25, 2002|work=About Health Canada|publisher=Canada|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217093738/http://hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/2002/2002_care-soinsbk4_e.html|archivedate=December 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An overview published by the federal government clarifies the conditions as follows:

====Public administration====
The health insurance plans must be "administered and operated on a non-profit basis by a public authority, responsible to the provincial/territorial governments and subject to audits of their accounts and financial transactions." (Section 8). This condition is the most frequently misunderstood; it does not deal with delivery, but with insurance. However, it does reduce the scope for private insurers to cover insured services (although they are still able to cover non-insured services, and/or non-insured persons).

====Comprehensiveness====
The health care insurance plans must cover "all insured health services provided by hospitals, medical practitioners or dentists" (Section 9). The ''Act'' lists, in the Definitions (Section 2), what is meant by insured services - in general, this retains the restriction to hospital and physician services arising from the earlier legislation.  The provinces are allowed, but not required, to insure additional services. Note that the CHA refers to "surgical dental services" but only if these must be provided within a hospital. In practice, this almost never occurs, and the annual health expenditure data published by the [[Canadian Institute for Health Information]] (CIHI) confirm that Canadian dental services are almost entirely financed privately. Lobbying by other providers, including nurses, led the act to speak of 'practitioners' rather than physicians; physician services had to be covered, but provinces were allowed, but not required, to define other health professions as qualifying under the ''Act''. To date, this provision has been used only occasionally; for example, some provinces have added [[Midwifery]], which means that their services are also fully publicly paid for.

====Universality====
All insured persons must be covered for insured health services "provided for by the plan on uniform terms and conditions" (Section 10). This definition of insured persons excludes those who may be covered by other federal or provincial legislation, such as serving members of the Canadian Forces or Royal Canadian Mounted Police, inmates of federal penitentiaries, persons covered by provincial workers' compensation, and some Aboriginal people. Some categories of resident, such as landed immigrants and Canadians returning to live in Canada from other countries, may be subject to a waiting period by a province or territory, not to exceed three months, before they are classified as insured persons; this waiting period arises from the portability provisions.&lt;ref name="chal10"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada Health Act, Section 10|publisher=Government of Canada|author=|date=1984-04-01|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-6/page-3.html#docCont|accessdate=2012-12-14|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portability====
Because plans are organized on a provincial basis, provisions are required for covering individuals who are in another province. The conditions attempt to separate temporary from more permanent absences by using three months as the maximum cut-off. As the above-mentioned summary clarifies, "Residents moving from one province or territory to another must continue to be covered for insured health care services by the "home" province during any minimum waiting period, not to exceed three months, imposed by the new province of residence. After the waiting period, the new province or territory of residence assumes health care coverage." The portability provisions are subject to inter-provincial agreements; there is variation in what is considered emergency (since the portability requirement does not extend to elective services), in how out-of-country care is covered (since there is no 'receiving' province), in how longer absences are dealt with (e.g., students studying in another province), whether the care will be paid for at home province or host province rates, and so on.

====Accessibility====
Finally, the insurance plan must provide for "reasonable access" to insured services by insured persons, "on uniform terms and conditions, unprecluded, unimpeded, either directly or indirectly, by charges (user charges or extra-billing) or other means (age, health status or financial circumstances);" (Section 12.a). This section also provides for "reasonable compensation for...services rendered by medical practitioners or dentists" and payments to hospitals that cover the cost of the health services provided. Note that neither reasonable access nor reasonable compensation are defined by the ''Act'', although there is a presupposition that certain processes (e.g., negotiations between the provincial governments and organizations representing the providers) satisfy the condition.  The ''Act'' allows for dollar-for-dollar withholding of contributions from any provinces allowing user charges or extra-billing to insured persons for insured services. As noted below, this provision was effective in 'solving' the extra-billing issue.

====Additional conditions====
Section 13 lists two additional conditions which must be met by the province in order to receive its full share of the federal transfers. The first condition is that the federal Minister of Health is entitled to specific information relating to a province's insured &amp; extended health care services. This information is used in drafting annual reports, presented to parliament, on how the province administered its health care services over the previous year. Again, there was - and continues to be - controversy as to how detailed this information should be.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The second condition is that the province must "give recognition" to the federal government "in any public documents, or in any advertising or promotional material, relating to insured health services and extended health care services in the province" (Section 13.b). Again, this is controversial.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Violations and penalties===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
In order to document compliance with the ''Act'', the federal [[Minister of Health (Canada)|Minister of Health]] annually reports to the [[Canadian Parliament]] on how the ''Act'' has been administered by each province over the course of the previous fiscal year.

For non-compliance with any of the five criteria listed above, the federal government may withhold all or a part of the transfer payment with "regard to the gravity of the default" (Section 15). Thus far all non-compliance issues have been settled through discussion or negotiation. Some{{who|date=February 2015}} argue that the federal government has not actively attempted to enforce these conditions, with particular issues around handling of portability (e.g., the reduction of coverage for residents while traveling abroad) and comprehensiveness (e.g., de-insuring of some medical procedures).

In accordance with section 20, if a province  were to violate the prohibition on extra-billing or user charges, the corresponding amount of that collected would be deducted from the transfer payment. Details about these amounts are available from the Canadian government websites.

One aspect of the ''Act'' was provision for reimbursement of funds withheld for extra-billing and user charges if these were eliminated within three years. Although often contentious (e.g., Ontario's physicians went on strike), all provinces complied with the provisions of the ''Act''. Although the amounts withheld were relatively modest—financial penalties totaling $246,732,000 were withheld from the provinces in the first two years—provinces found it difficult to resist the pressure. (They found that many interest groups seeking additional funds would argue that it could be afforded if the province/territory eliminated their extra billing/user fees. Faced with multiple claims on the same pot, most provinces decided that the easiest path was to eliminate these charges.)

In 1993, British Columbia allowed approximately 40 medical practitioners to use extra-billing in their practices. In response, the federal government reduced B.C.'s EPF payments by a total of $2,025,000 over the course of four years.

In 1996, Alberta had their EPF payment reduced by a total of $3,585,000 over the course of a few years due to the use of private clinics that charged user fees. Newfoundland suffered the loss of $323,000 until 1998 and Manitoba lost a total of $2,056,000 until 1999 from user fees being charged at private clinics. Nova Scotia has also forgone EPF payment for their use of user fees in private clinics.

As required by section 23 of the ''Canada Health Act'', the Government of Canada publishes a yearly report describing the extent to which each province and territory has complied with the Act.

==Weaknesses of the CHA==
[[Pro-choice]] advocates have pointed out that the ''Canada Health Act'' fails to meet its criteria in providing access to abortion. Abortion, as a medical service, does not meet the basic principles of the ''Act'': public administration, comprehensiveness, universality, portability, and accessibility. Joyce Arthur concludes that "Abortion services fail at least 4 out 5 of these tests." The delivery of abortion services fails comprehensiveness because clinics are not equally funded, universality because of lack of equal access across the country and especially in rural areas, portability because abortion is excluded from the standard reciprocal billing between provinces, accessibility because of lack of clinics in some provinces, and possibly public administration because private clinics are forced to administer its costs.&lt;ref name="cha-fail"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada Health Act Violates Abortion Services: Five Basic Principles Not Met|publisher=Pro Choice Action Network|first=Joyce|last=Arthur|date=November 2001|url=http://www.prochoiceactionnetwork-canada.org/articles/healthact.shtml|accessdate=2012-12-14|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, general oral health care is not included in the ''Act''. Most Canadians receive oral health care through privately operated dental clinics and pay for services through insurance or by paying for it themselves. Some dental services are covered through government dental programs.

Future [[Saskatchewan]] [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] [[Ryan Meili]] stated "Extra-billing in Ontario, private MRIs in Saskatchewan and user fees in Quebec: violations of the ''Canada Health Act'' are on the rise across the country. Canadian doctors are concerned about the impact of this trend not only on their patients, but on our public health care system as well".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/ryan-meili/canada-health-act_b_9610424.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''"cash-for-questions affair"''' was a political scandal of the 1990s in the [[United Kingdom]].

It began in October 1994 when ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper alleged that [[London]]'s most successful parliamentary lobbyist,&lt;ref name="indy1996"&gt;{{cite news |first=Christian |last=Wolmar |authorlink=Christian Wolmar |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/greers-lobby-empire-crashes-1315281.html |title=Greer's lobby empire crashes |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=20 December 1996 |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Greer]] of Ian Greer Associates had bribed two [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Members of Parliament in exchange for asking [[parliamentary questions]] and performing other tasks on behalf of the Egyptian owner of [[Harrods]] department store, [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]].&lt;ref name=claim&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/conservatives/story/0,,536101,00.html|title=Tory MPs were paid to plant questions says Harrods chief|work=The Guardian|date=20 October 1994|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''[[The Guardian]]'''s report alleged that Al-Fayed had approached the paper and accused Ian Greer of paying then-MPs [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] and [[Tim Smith (UK politician)|Tim Smith]] to table parliamentary questions on his behalf at £2,000 a time.&lt;ref name=claim/&gt; Smith resigned immediately after admitting to accepting payments from Al-Fayed himself, but not from Greer as ''The Guardian'' had alleged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/tim-smith-does-the-decent-thing-1275195.html|title=Tim Smith does the decent thing|work=The Independent|date=27 March 1997|accessdate=8 March 2010 | location=London | first=Christian | last=Wolmar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton and Greer immediately issued libel writs in the [[Courts of England and Wales#High Court|High Court]] against ''The Guardian'' to clear their names.&lt;ref name=liar&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1996/oct/01/hamiltonvalfayed.davidhencke|title=A liar and a cheat – Disgraced former minister and lobbyist abandon £10m case at last minute|work=The Guardian|date=8 March 2010|accessdate=8 March 2010 | location=London | first=David | last=Hencke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The furore prompted the then-prime minister [[John Major]] to instigate the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life|Nolan Committee]], to review the issue of standards in public life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/the-attack-on-sleaze-nolan-committee-expected-to-look-at-outside-interests-1445481.html|title=The Attack on Sleaze: Nolan committee expected to look at outside interests|work=The Independent|date=24 October 1994|accessdate=8 March 2010 | location=London | first=Donald | last=MacIntyre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six weeks later in December 1994, in a private letter to the chairman of the parliamentary watchdog the Members' Interests Committee, Mohamed Al-Fayed alleged that he had paid Hamilton, in addition to the original allegations that Ian Greer was the paymaster. Hamilton denied this new allegation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

The [[Defamation Act 1996]] was designed to alter the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], and allows an MP to waive parliamentary privilege. This would have permitted Hamilton to give evidence in court concerning statements he made in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref name=dates/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2230.00087/abstract|title='Only Flattery is Safe': Political Speech and the Defamation Act 1996|accessdate=8 March 2010 | doi=10.1111/1468-2230.00087|volume=60|journal=Modern Law Review|pages=388–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, at the end of September 1996, three days before Hamilton's and Greer's libel actions were due to start, three of Mohamed Al-Fayed's employees claimed that they had processed cash payments to the two men. Hamilton and Greer denied these new allegations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Hamilton and Greer withdrew their libel action on 30 September 1996.&lt;ref name=dates&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/196466.stm|title=UK Politics: Talking Politics – Neil Hamilton – A chronology|work=BBC News|accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=19 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton's and Greer's withdrawal of their libel actions provoked an avalanche of condemnation of the two men in the British press, led by ''The Guardian''. [[Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|Parliament]] initiated an official inquiry into the affair, to be led by Sir [[Gordon Downey]].&lt;ref name=dates/&gt;

In December 1996, Ian Greer's lobbying company collapsed.&lt;ref name="indy1996"/&gt;

Downey began his inquiry in early 1997, but before he published his report Prime Minister [[John Major]] [[Prorogation Act 1867|prorogued]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; parliament for [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|a general election]], to be held on 1 May 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Boyd Hunt, ''Trial by Conspiracy: Story of How Mohamed Al-Fayed and "The Guardian" Put an Innocent Man in the Dock - and Why'' p.29, Greenzone Publishing, October 1998 {{ISBN|0473051230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith resigned from parliament on 25 March, and stood down in the general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tim-smith-thrust-back-to-obscurity-1275235.html|website=Independent|accessdate=14 May 2017|title=Tim Smith Thrust Back to Obscurity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/22/hamiltonvalfayed|website=Guardian|accessdate=14 May 2017|title=Chronology - How the scandal unfolded}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the election, former BBC reporter [[Martin Bell]] stood in Hamilton's Cheshire constituency of [[Tatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tatton]] as an independent candidate on an "anti-corruption" platform. Bell easily defeated Hamilton with the assistance of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], who both withdrew their candidates and supplied party workers to help Bell's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Hunt, ''Trial by Conspiracy'' p.31, Greenzone Publishing, October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Gordon Downey published his 900-page report in early July 1997, clearing Ian Greer, Neil Hamilton, and Tim Smith of ''The Guardian'''s original allegations that Ian Greer had paid the two MPs to table questions. However, Downey decreed that the three Fayed employees' testimony that they had processed cash payments to Hamilton amounted to "compelling evidence", though he did not accept their claims to have processed cash payments to the lobbyist Greer.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Hunt, ''Trial by Conspiracy'' p.311, Greenzone Publishing, October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the [[Standards and Privileges Committee]] published its conclusions in relation to complaints made by ''The Guardian'' and Mohamed Al Fayed, which concluded:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmselect/cmstnprv/240vii/sp0703.htm|title=COMPLAINTS FROM MR MOHAMED AL FAYED,THE GUARDIAN AND OTHERS AGAINST 25 MEMBERS AND FORMER MEMBERS|publisher=Parliament|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Michael Brown (British politician)|Michael Brown]]
:"Mr Brown failed to register an introduction payment from Mr Greer in relation to US Tobacco."
:"Mr Brown persistently and deliberately failed to declare his interests in dealing with Ministers and officials over the [[Skoal (tobacco)|Skoal Bandits]] issue."
:"Mr Brown has expressed regret for these omissions."

*Sir [[Peter Hordern]]
:He had no obligation to disclose to Ministers the interests of his colleagues.
:Although the extent to which he declared his own interests on [[House of Fraser]] matters fell well short of the terms of the 1974 Resolution, there is no evidence that Ministers and officials were misled by this.
:The spirit of the rules would have been better observed had Sir Peter made a separate Register entry in respect of Mr Al Fayed's hospitality, but this omission was not improper by the standards accepted at the time.
:The allegation that Sir Peter tabled questions for cash is without substance and has been withdrawn.

*Sir [[Andrew Bowden]]:
:There is insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegation that Sir Andrew received, or demanded, cash payments from Mr Al Fayed in return for lobbying services.
:The election donation of £5,319 from Mr Greer was intended as a reward for lobbying and Sir Andrew probably knew it came originally from Mr Al Fayed.
:Sir Andrew failed to register, as he should have done, this election campaign donation.
:Sir Andrew failed to declare his interests in dealings with Ministers and officials over House of Fraser, and, in one case, gave a positively misleading explanation for his representations.

*Sir [[Michael Grylls]]
:Sir Michael received payments from Mr Greer (though not in cash) which were neither introduction commissions nor fees associated with the Unitary Tax Campaign.
:It is not possible to conclude that these payments originated from Mr Al Fayed, although Sir Michael actively participated in the Greer lobbying operation.
:Sir Michael deliberately misled the Select Committee on Members' Interests in 1990 by seriously understating the number of commission payments he had received; and by omitting to inform them of other fees received from Mr Greer.
:Sir Michael persistently failed to declare his interests in dealings with ministers and officials over the House of Fraser.
:Sir Michael's action in taking a commission payment for introducing a constituent to Mr Greer was unacceptable.
:There is insufficient evidence to show that Sir Michael solicited business for Mr Greer in expectation of commission payments.

*Mr [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]]
:Mr Smith accepted cash payments directly from Mr Al Fayed of between £18,000 and £25,000 in return for lobbying services. There is no evidence to indicate that he received cash from Mr Al Fayed indirectly through Mr Greer.
:The way in which these payments were received and concealed fell well below the standards expected of members of parliament.
:The allegation that Mr Smith was paid to initiate an Adjournment debate in 1986 is not substantiated.
:Mr Smith's financial interest in relation to House of Fraser was only registered in January 1989 when it had been publicly exposed by Mr Rowland; and then only hesitantly for a period of two and a half weeks. This has to be seen as a disingenuous attempt at concealment. On any view, this was a totally unacceptable form of registration by Mr Smith.
:Mr Smith persistently and deliberately failed to declare his interests in dealings with ministers and officials over House of Fraser issues.
:To his credit, Mr Smith eventually admitted receiving payments, although not until he was asked in 1994; and he expressed his regrets for the non-registration and non-declaration of interests."Smith accepted cash payments directly from Mr Al Fayed of between £18,000 and £25,000 in return for lobbying services...persistently and deliberately failed to declare his interests in dealings with Ministers and officials over House of Fraser issues... Mr Smith's conduct fell seriously below the standards which the House is entitled to expect ... had he still been a Member we would recommend a substantial period of suspension from the service of the House"

== Hamilton vs Al-Fayed ==
In 1998 Neil Hamilton issued a writ for libel against Mohamed al-Fayed, over allegations that Al-Fayed had made on a [[Channel 4]] documentary programme broadcast in January 1997. In late 1999 the trial began at the High Court.  Hamilton lost and was ordered to pay costs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Two months later, in February 2000, ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' reported that shortly before Hamilton's libel action Mohamed Al-Fayed had acquired reams of privileged legal papers stolen from the chambers of Hamilton's barristers. Hamilton immediately lodged an appeal against his libel defeat.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

In late 2000, Hamilton's appeal was heard at the [[Courts of England and Wales#Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]].  The three judges dismissed Hamilton's appeal on the grounds that Fayed's acquisition of the stolen papers would not have materially affected the outcome of the trial.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

In 2001 Neil Hamilton declared bankruptcy.

== Riddick and Treddinick ==
Though the term "cash for questions affair" is used to refer to the events that followed the publication of ''The Guardian'''s story, it was not the first time that a British newspaper had accused MPs of taking bribes to table questions.  Three months earlier, in July 1994, a 'sting' operation by [[The Sunday Times (UK)|''The Sunday Times'']] reported that two Conservative MPs [[Graham Riddick]] and [[David Tredinnick (politician)|David Treddinick]] had accepted cheques for £1,000 for agreeing to table a parliamentary question.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cashforquestions-mps-suspended-by-commons-1616440.html Cash-for-questions MPs suspended by Commons] (retrieved 25 February 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The two were suspended from parliament for 10 and 20 days respectively, Mr Riddick receiving a shorter 'sentence' due to his apparent decision to [[Non-apology apology|apologise]] quickly and return his cheque [[Bribery|bribe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19950421/ai_n13978206 Cash-for-questions MPs suspended by Commons]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riddick lodged a formal complaint with the [[Press Complaints Commission]] (PCC). Basing its decisions on the information compiled by the Commons' Privileges Committee the PCC found in Riddick's favour. The commission judged that ''The Sunday Times'' failed to make clear to its readers that its approach to Riddick had been on the basis of a legitimate consultancy, not on the basis of a one-off payment in return for asking a question and that there was no justification for the newspaper's resort to subterfuge.  This overturned a ruling two years earlier by the PCC in favour of ''The Sunday Times'' when Riddick had been unaware that the PCC was investigating the matter.  The PCC apologised to Riddick for 'this serious breach of our procedures.'&lt;ref&gt;Huddersfield Examiner, 27 March 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199495/cmhansrd/1995-04-20/Debate-4.html |title=Column 371 |work=Hansard |date=20 April 1995 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605021756/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199495/cmhansrd/1995-04-20/Debate-4.html |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Union for South Tyrol was founded on 2 October 1989 by the merger of the nationalist [[South Tyrolean Homeland Federation]] of [[Eva Klotz]] (2.3% in the [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol regional election, 1988|1988 provincial election]]), the [[national liberalism|national-liberal]] [[Freedom Party of South Tyrol]] led by [[Gerold Meraner]] and right-wing splinters from the [[South Tyrolean People's Party]] led by [[Alfons Benedikter]].&lt;ref name="Pallaver2007"&gt;{{Citation |first=Günther |last=Pallaver |title=Südtirols politische Parteien 1945-2005 |work=Die Region Trentino-Südtirol im 20. Jahrhundert — 1: Politik und Institutionen |language=German |year=2007 |page=613 |url=http://www.uibk.ac.at/politikwissenschaft/team/homepage-mitarbeiter/webpage-guenther-pallaver/pdf/pallaver_591-628_tedesco.pdf}} &lt;br&gt; or {{Citation |first=Günther |last=Pallaver |title=I partiti politici in Alto Adige dal 1945 al 2005 |work=La Regione Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol nel XX secolo — I: Politica e Istituzioni |language=Italian |year=2007 |page=583 |url=http://www.uibk.ac.at/politikwissenschaft/team/homepage-mitarbeiter/webpage-guenther-pallaver/pdf/pallaver_561-600.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol regional election, 1993|1993 provincial election]] the party won 4.8% of the vote and gained 2 seats in the Provincial Council, one for Klotz and one for Benedikter. In the [[Italian general election, 1996|1996 general election]] the party had its best result ever (7.7% for party list and 19.2% in single-seat constituencies), because the [[South Tyrolean People's Party]] had formed an alliance with some Italian parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://elezionistorico.interno.it/enti.php?tp=C&amp;dt=21/04/1996&amp;cta=I&amp;ord=3&amp;sut1=6&amp;sut2=0&amp;sut3=0&amp;sut4=0&amp;liv=1&amp;descE=%20Circoscrizione:%20TRENTINO%20ALTO%20ADIGE&amp;descA={{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol regional election, 1998|1998 provincial election]] the UfS won 5.5% and [[Andreas Pöder]], party secretary since 1994, was elected for the first time to the Council, along with Klotz. This was a turning point for the party as Pöder started to gain influence over Klotz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consiglio-bz.org/it/archivio_storico.htm |accessdate=August 13, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509191227/http://www.consiglio-bz.org/it/archivio_storico.htm |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol provincial elections, 2003|2003 provincial election]], the UfS won 6.8% of the vote and gained 2 seats in the Provincial Council.

In May 2007, during a heated party congress, Pöder was re-elected party president with 76 votes in favour and 70 against. This led to a split led by Kloz, who launched a new strictly separatist movement named [[South Tyrolean Freedom]] (STF).

In the [[Italian general election, 2008 (Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol)|2008 general election]], severely damaged by the split and by the competition of [[Die Freiheitlichen]] (9.4%), the UfS gained only 4.2% of the vote in the Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elezioni.bz.it/camerprov_li_vg.htm |accessdate=August 13, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301074837/http://www.elezioni.bz.it/camerprov_li_vg.htm |archivedate=March 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol provincial elections, 2008|2008 provincial election]] the party got only 2.3% of the vote and one elect in the Provincial Council, while STF and Die Freiheitlichen won the 14.3% and the 4.9% of the vote, respectively.

The UfS renamed itself to '''Citizens' Union for South Tyrol''' (BUfS) on 12 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suedtirolnews.it/wap/d/artikel/2011/05/12/aus-unfion-fuer-suedtirol-wird-buergerunion.html?type=10&amp;cHash=b7becd9862f49f52e91bcfa51c073667 d: SüdtirolNews - News aus Südtirol&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319223518/http://www.suedtirolnews.it/wap/d/artikel/2011/05/12/aus-unfion-fuer-suedtirol-wird-buergerunion.html?type=10&amp;cHash=b7becd9862f49f52e91bcfa51c073667 |date=March 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the forthcoming [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol provincial elections, 2013|2013 provincial election]] the BUfS will run as part of a three-party list, along with [[Ladins Dolomites]], a centre-left outfit, and [[We South Tyroleans]], a left-wing split from Die Freiheitlichen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://altoadige.gelocal.it/cronaca/2013/08/09/news/egger-si-presenta-alle-elezioni-con-poder-e-ladins-1.7556003 |title=Egger si presenta alle elezioni con Pöder e Ladins |newspaper=Alto Adige |date=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The joint list won 2.1% of the vote and Pöder was re-elected to the Provincial Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.provinz.bz.it/vote/landtag2013/results/home_ld_vg.htm |title=Landtagswahlen 2013: Endgültige Ergebnisse |publisher=Autonome Provinz Bozen Südtirol |accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Italian general election, 2018 (Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol)|2018 general election]] was [[Lega Nord|League]] supported by BUfS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.salto.bz/de/article/28022018/poeder-empfiehlt-die-lega|title=Pöder empfiehlt die Lega|date=28 February 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tageszeitung.it/2018/02/28/poeder-waehlt-salvini/|title=Pöder wählt Salvini  –   Die Neue Südtiroler Tageszeitung|website=www.tageszeitung.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
Since the exit of [[Eva Klotz]], the UfS tried to renew its image and to present itself as a [[centrism|centrist]]-[[conservatism|conservative]] party. The [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol provincial elections, 2008|2008]] party programme included defense of [[family values]], protection of the [[Environmental policy|environment]], and a moderately [[economic liberalism|liberal economic]] policy, along with the historic goal of separating South Tyrol from Italy in order to re-unify it with old [[County of Tyrol|historic Tyrol]] composed from South, North and East Tyrol, founding the ''[[Tyrol–South Tyrol–Trentino Euroregion|Europaregion Tirol]]'' (North-and East-Tyrol are actually parts of [[Austria]]).

More recently, the party re-branded itself as a [[centrism|centrist]], to some extent [[centre-left politics|centre-left]], party and distanced from its original [[separatism]] and the parties of the "German right".&lt;ref name="AA-2013-09-28"/&gt; In 2011 Pöder said that, were he a German citizen, he would be a [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stol.it/Artikel/Politik-im-Ueberblick/Lokal/Sozialdemokrat-Andreas-Poeder-Neustart-mit-BuergerUnion |title="Sozialdemokrat" Andreas Pöder: Neustart mit BürgerUnion |newspaper=Stol.it |date=12 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714150821/http://www.stol.it/Artikel/Politik-im-Ueberblick/Lokal/Sozialdemokrat-Andreas-Poeder-Neustart-mit-BuergerUnion |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 declaered: "Don't call us German right, we are a centrist movement".&lt;ref name="AA-2013-10-09"/&gt;

'''Democratic liberalism''' aims to reach a synthesis of [[democracy]] which is the participation of the people in the power, and [[liberalism]], a political and/or social philosophy advocating the freedom of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/liberalism|title=the definition of liberalism|website=www.dictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It arose after [[World War I]] (with most major nations enacting [[universal suffrage]]), and its main question was how to get the population involved and interested in politics outside of elections.    

The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)]] describe their ideology as giving "power to the people"; they are against the concentration of power in unaccountable bodies. They propose decentralisation of power out of Westminster, and electoral and parliamentary reform, to create a system of tiered government structures to make decisions at what they see as the right level, including regional assemblies, the European Union, and international organisations. The Liberal Democrats want to protect civil liberties, and oppose state intervention in personal affairs.

Craig Duncan says in his ''Democratic Liberalism: The Politics of Dignity'' that:

{{cquote|One important question concerns whether to have a direct democracy (in which citizens themselves propose and vote on laws) or a representative democracy (in which elected offices perform these functions). To a large extent this question is settled by pragmatic considerations (direct democracies are better suited to small city-states than to today’s large nationstates), but a dignity-based case is not wholly silent here. I do not believe that the demands of dignity require direct democracy, for to say that citizens are competent beings capable of responsible choice is not to say they are all competent to judge the various issues requiring political attention, from taxes to defense to education to the environment and so on. A representative democracy instead, and more accurately, presumes citizens are first and foremost competent to choose leaders who are themselves competent at judging these issues. This is not to say that the ideal of direct democracy has no relevance, however. Since in fact many private citizens do have competent knowledge of a variety of issues, especially those that directly implicate their interests, a representative democracy should also create significant space for citizen input into its deliberative practices (via open hearings and other public forums, say).}}

==History==
[[File:Cdndepartmentdefense.jpg|thumb|left|230px|[[National Defence Headquarters (Canada)|National Defence Headquarters]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]]]
The Department of National Defence was established by the [[National Defence Act]], which merged the [[Department of Militia and Defence (Canada)|Department of Militia and Defence]] (which was created in 1906 when the British Army withdrew its forces stationed in Canada), the [[Department of Naval Services]] (the department responsible for the administration of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]), and the [[Air Board (Canada)|Air Board]] (which oversaw aviation in Canada). The National Defence Act was passed by the [[Parliament of Canada]] on June 28, 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gough|first=Barry|title=Historical Dictionary of Canada|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0-8108-5496-1|authorlink=Barry M. Gough|page=xxxvii}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 December 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
[[Image:Defence_Team_Organisational_Structure_2014.jpg|right|400px]]

Both the Canadian Armed Forces (military) and the Department of National Defence (civilian civil servants) are, although two separate organizations, known collectively as '''The Defence Team''' as both institutions work closely together in the defence of Canada. The Minister of National Defence, as the member of cabinet responsible to Parliament for National Defence, heads the Defence Team. The Department of National Defence is headed by the Deputy Minister of National Defence. Under the Deputy Minister are a variety of associate deputy and assistant deputy ministers who are responsible for various aspects of the department (human resources, policy, etc.). The Deputy Minister is appointed by the Governor General on behalf of the Queen of Canada ([[Queen-in-Council]]) on the [[advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=AboutDND&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/about-notresujet/index-eng.asp | title=The Deputy Minister of National Defence | publisher=Department of National Defence | date=February 1, 2012 | accessdate=March 8, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301004725/http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/about-notresujet/index-eng.asp | archivedate=March 1, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-5/page-2.html#h-6 | title=National Defence Act | publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada | year=2012 | accessdate=September 2, 2012 | pages=R.S., c. N-4, s. 7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian Armed Forces, as a separate and distinct organization, is headed by the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Canada)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], and reporting to him are the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Air Force, and a variety of other commands. There are also a variety of offices and support organizations which report to both the Chief of Defence Staff and the Deputy Minister. 

The [[Monarchy in Canada|Canadian Sovereign]], represented by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], is responsible for appointing the Minister, Deputy Minister, and Chief of Defence Staff on the recommendation of the [[Queen's Privy Council of Canada]]. Although not part of the Defence Team organizational structure, the legal military [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] within the Canadian Forces originates from the Queen of Canada as [[Commander-in-Chief of Canada|Commander-in-Chief]] (represented by the Governor General), through the Chief of the Defence Staff to all military officers by virtue of their holding of the Queen’s Commission, and thus through them to all members of the Canadian Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/about-org-structure/chief-of-defence-staff.page | title=Role of the Chief of Defence Staff | publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada | date=17 April 2014 | accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defence portfolio==
{{Main|Minister of National Defence (Canada)}}

The Minister of National Defence is responsible for the entire Defence Portfolio comprising several organizations, including the [[Canadian Armed Forces]], the [[Communications Security Establishment]], [[Defence Research and Development Canada]], and the Department of National Defence, amongst others. The department is not responsible for all of these organizations itself, but rather exists to support the minister in carrying out all of his duties within the Defence Portfolio. The Canadian Forces are a distinct and separate entity from the Department of National Defence.&lt;ref name=AboutDND/&gt;

The '''''dérive''''' ({{IPA-fr|de.ʁiv|lang}}, "drift") is a revolutionary strategy originally put forward in the "Theory of the Dérive" (1956) by [[Guy Debord]], a member at the time of the [[Letterist International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beach-Beneath-Street-Situationist-International/dp/1844677206|title=The Beach Beneath the Street: The Everyday Life and Glorious Times of the Situationist International|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|date=2011-06-20|publisher=Verso Books|isbn=9781844677207|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debord defines the ''dérive'' as "a mode of experimental behavior linked to the conditions of urban society: a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiances."&lt;ref name="Debord1958Definitions"&gt;Guy Debord (1958) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/definitions.html Definitions]''. Internationale Situationniste #1 (Paris, June 1958). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an unplanned journey through a landscape, usually [[city|urban]], in which participants drop their everyday relations and "let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there". Though solo ''dérives'' are possible, Debord indicates &lt;blockquote&gt;that the most fruitful numerical arrangement consists of several small groups of two or three people who have reached the same level of awareness, since cross-checking these different groups' impressions makes it possible to arrive at more objective conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/theory.html|title=Theory of the Derive|last=Debord|first=Guy|date=1956|website=Situationist International Online|access-date=2016-07-12|translator=Ken Knabb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The ''dérive''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s goals include studying the terrain of the city (psychogeography) and emotional disorientation, both of which lead to the potential creation of [[Situationist International#Etymology and usage|Situations]].

==History==

The concept of the ''dérive'' has its origins in the [[Letterist International]], an [[avant-garde]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] collective based in [[Paris]]. The ''dérive'' was a critical tool for understanding and developing the theory of [[psychogeography]], defined as the "specific effects of the geographical environment (whether consciously organized or not) on the emotions and behavior of individuals."&lt;ref name="Debord1958Definitions"/&gt;

The ''dérive'' continued to be a critical concept in the theories of the [[Situationist International]], a radical group of [[avant-garde|avant-garde artists]] and political theorists that was formed out of the Letterist International, CoBrA, and the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]] in the 1950s. For the Situationists, the ''dérive'' was a revolutionary technique to combat the malaise and boredom of the [[The Society of the Spectacle|society of the spectacle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Society-Spectacle-Guy-Debord/dp/0934868077|title=Society of the Spectacle|last=Debord|first=Guy|date=1984-12-12|publisher=Black &amp; Red,U.S.|isbn=9780934868075|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dérives'' are necessary, according to Situationist theory, because of the increasingly predictable and monotonous experience of [[everyday life]] in [[advanced capitalism]].&lt;ref name="Debord1956Theory"&gt;Guy Debord (1956) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/theory.html Theory of the Dérive]''. Les Lèvres Nues #9 (Paris, November 1956).
Reprinted in Internationale Situationniste #2 (Paris, December 1958). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt; Debord observes in his ''Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography'':

{{blockquote|The sudden change of ambiance in a street within the space of a few meters; the evident division of a city into zones of distinct psychic atmospheres; the [[path of least resistance]] that is automatically followed in aimless strolls (and which has no relation to the physical contour of the terrain); the appealing or repelling character of certain places — these phenomena all seem to be neglected. In any case they are never envisaged as depending on causes that can be uncovered by careful analysis and turned to account.|Guy Debord, ''Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography''&lt;ref name="Debord1955Introduction"&gt;Guy Debord (1955) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/presitu/geography.html Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography]''. Les Lèvres Nues #6 (Paris, September 1955). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Praxis==
Several groups have adopted the concept of the ''dérive'' and applied it in their own form, including many modern organizations, most notably the [[Loiterers Resistance Movement]] (Manchester), the [[London Psychogeographical Association]], [[Wrights &amp; Sites|Wrights and Sites]] (notably the misguided drifts of [http://www.mythogeography.com/ mythogeographer Phil Smith)], and the [[Providence Initiative for Psychogeographic Studies]]. Since 2003 in the [[United States]], separate events known as the [[Providence Initiative for Psychogeographic Studies]] and [[Psy-Geo-Conflux]] have been dedicated to action-based participatory experiments similar to the ''dérive'' within the context of psychogeography.

==Technology==
A smartphone app named Dérive was developed in the 21st century by a team including  Eduardo Cachucho and Babak Fakhamzadeh. The smartphone app shows a series of simple geography-based directions such as "follow a red vehicle" to create the dérive.&lt;ref&gt; Dérive app, http://deriveapp.com/s/v2/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Edirimanne Corea Family Union''' ('''ECFU''') is a group set up to 'foster interaction' among the members of the powerful Corea family
in the island of [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name="Edirimanne Corea Family Union"&gt;{{cite web |title=Reference to ECFU in the Daily News, Sri Lanka on 29 July,2003 |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2003/07/29/new26.html|accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Corea family is one of the leading families of Sri Lanka. They trace their ancestry to [[Dominicus Corea]] also known as Edirille Rala who was crowned King of [[Kotte]] and [[Sitawaka]] in Sri Lanka - Dominicus Corea was born in Colombo in 1565.

Dominicus Corea, the warrior king, rebelled against the colonial [[Portugal|Portuguese]] forces and waged war against them.&lt;ref name="King Dominicus Corea"&gt;{{cite web|title=Narrates a whole sum account of the events surrounding Edirille Rala| url=http://vernoncorea.wordpress.com/2011/07/17/king-dominicus-corea-of-kotte-article-by-deva-corea/|accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually captured by the Portuguese and executed on July 14, 1596, at the age of 31 in [[Colombo]]. "Such was the sad end of Domingos Corea, Edirimana Suriya Bandara, the greatest [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] of his day," said Sri Lankan historian John M. Seneviratna. 'Great Warriors like Mayadunne, Veediya Bandara, Seethawaka Rajasinghe, Vimaladharmasuriya I, Senarath, Rajasinghe II, Nikapitiye Bandara and Edirille Rala who fought the Portuguese to preserve our territorial integrity and kept the Portuguese at bay despite all odds,' wrote Janaka Perera in the Asian Tribune.&lt;ref name="warrior"&gt;{{cite web |title=Reference to Edirille Rala in the Asian Tribune article by Janaka Perera |url=http://www.asiantribune.com/node/9442|accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Corea Family from Chilaw==
Kumari Jayawardena, the Sri Lankan author, writing about the Coreas observed: 'Unconnected to the liquor trade but making their money on plantation ventures was the Corea Family of Chilaw, an influential [[govigama]] group with a history going back to Portuguese rule when they were warriors to Sinhala kings. During Dutch and British rule, members of the family were officials serving the state in various ways and rewarded with titles. Some members of the family took to the legal and medical professions, most notably the sons of Charles Edward Corea (a solicitor), who were active in local politics and in the Chilaw Association which campaigned against British land policies - especially the Waste Lands Ordinance, and for political reforms. The most active of Corea's sons was C.E. (Charles Edgar) who spoke up for peasant rights and was militant in his stand against the government. He was President of the Ceylon National Congress in 1924. C.E. Corea's brother, Alfred Ernest, was a doctor and the youngest Victor Corea was a lawyer who achieved fame for leading a campaign (and going to jail) in 1922 to protest the Poll Tax on all males; he was the first President of the Ceylon Labour Union led by A.E. Goonesinha and was active in the Ceylon Labour Party. While being professionals and political activists, the Coreas were also important landowners. '&lt;ref name="Coreas"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kumari Jayawardena in her book 'Nobodies to Somebodies - The Rise of the Colonial Bourgeoisie in Sri Lanka,' writes about the Coreas on page 194 (Sanjiva Books)|url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/archive/20090628/review.htm|accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ECFU group according to the Daily News of Sri Lanka was set up in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="ECFU"&gt;{{cite web |title=Reference in the Daily News, Sri Lanka on 29 July,2003 |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2003/07/29/new26.html|accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Corea family that hails from Chilaw and has produced freedom fighters, members of the Legislative Council, State Council, House of Representatives, the diplomatic corps, broadcasting and print media and professionals in many fields, are knit together by an active family union.&lt;ref name="Corea Family"&gt;{{cite web |title=Reference in the Sunday Times, Sri Lanka on 5 September, 2010 |url=http://sundaytimes.lk/100905/Plus/plus_30.html|accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various buildings in Chilaw have been named after [[Srikuradas Charles Shirley Corea]] and [[Harindra Corea]] who represented the town as members of parliament. [[Charles Edgar Corea]] and [[Victor Corea]] tirelessly campaigned for the freedom of Sri Lanka - from British rule. They founded the Chilaw Association and were founder members of the Ceylon National Congress.

They were also elected members of the [[Legislative Council of Ceylon]]. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] recognising the contribution made by the Coreas to the independence movement in Ceylon, visited Chilaw and stayed with the Corea Family in a house called 'Sigiriya' during his only visit to the island in 1927.&lt;ref name="Mahatma Gandhi"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gandhi at Sigiriya - article in the Daily News, Sri Lanka|url=http://chilaw-and-gandhi.tripod.com/id3.html|accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent Annual General Meeting of the Edirimanne Corea Family Union and Members' Day-Out was held at the Leisure Lounge of the 'Ambalama' in Hanwella and the old and the young took their chance to meet, greet, unwind, relax and carry home memories of the warmth and intimacy of a family legacy. Singing, dancing and games replete with prizes and surprises filled the air. Nearly one-hundred members of the Corea family met to elect the following Office Bearers for 2010/2011 :

Patron: Dr Vijaya Corea; President: Dr Eugene Corea; Vice Presidents: Nirmali Jayasekera and Surangani Ameresekere; Secretary: Neville S. Weerasekera; Asst Secretary: Patsy Abeyasekera; Treasurer: Suvendreni Y.

==Quotes about the Edirimane Corea Family Union==
'The Corea Family Union was formed with the descendants of Dominicus Corea, alias Edirille Rala who had rendered an immortal service to protect the country from Portuguese invasion. It is notable to write that the Corea Union is open to all the descendants of Dominicus Corea.'
- Dr. Mirando Obeysekere, Daily News, Sri Lanka.

{{Anglicanism}}
The '''English Reformation''' was a series of events in 16th-century England by which the [[Church of England]] broke away from the authority of the Pope and the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. These events were, in part, associated with the wider process of the European [[Protestant Reformation]], a religious and political movement that affected the practice of Christianity across western and central Europe during this period. Many factors contributed to the process: the decline of [[feudalism]] and the rise of [[nationalism]], the rise of the [[common law]], the invention of the [[printing press]] and increased circulation of the [[Bible]], and the transmission of new knowledge and ideas among scholars, the upper and middle classes and readers in general. However, the various phases of the English Reformation, which also covered [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]], were largely driven by changes in government policy, to which public opinion gradually accommodated itself.

Based on [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s desire for an annulment of his marriage (first requested of [[Pope Clement VII]] in 1527), the English Reformation was at the outset more of a political affair than a theological dispute. The reality of political differences between Rome and England allowed growing theological disputes to come to the fore.&lt;ref name=scruton1996p470&gt;{{cite book | last = Scruton | first = Roger | author-link = Roger Scruton | title = A Dictionary of Political Thought | publisher = Macmillan | date = 1996 | page = 470 | isbn = 9780333647868 | ref=harv}} "The Reformation must not be confused with the changes introduced into the Church of England during the 'Reformation Parliament' of 1529–36, which were of a political rather than a religious nature, designed to unite the secular and religious sources of authority within a single sovereign power: the Anglican Church did not until later make any substantial change in doctrine."&lt;/ref&gt; Until the break with Rome, it was the Pope and general councils of the Church that decided [[doctrine]]. Church law was governed by [[canon law]] with final jurisdiction in Rome. Church taxes were paid straight to Rome, and the Pope had the final word in the appointment of bishops.

The break with Rome was effected by a series of acts of Parliament passed between 1532 and 1534, among them the 1534 [[Acts of Supremacy|Act of Supremacy]], which declared that Henry was the "Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England".&lt;ref name="bray"&gt;Bray Gerald (ed) ''Documents of the English Reformation'' James Clarke &amp; C° Cambridge p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; (This title was renounced by [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] in 1553 in the process of restoring papal jurisdiction; when [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] reasserted the royal supremacy in 1559, her title was [[Supreme Governor]].)&lt;ref name="bray"/&gt; Final authority in doctrinal and legal disputes now rested with the monarch, and the papacy was deprived of revenue and the final say on the appointment of bishops.

The [[theology]] and [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] of the Church of England became markedly [[Protestant]] during the reign of Henry's son [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] largely along lines laid down by Archbishop [[Thomas Cranmer]]. Under Mary, the whole process was reversed and the Church of England was again placed under papal jurisdiction. Soon after, Elizabeth reintroduced the Protestant faith but in a more moderate manner. The structure and theology of the church was a matter of fierce dispute for generations.

The violent aspect of these disputes, manifested in the [[English Civil War]]s, ended when the last Roman Catholic monarch, [[James II of England|James II]], was deposed, and Parliament asked [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] to rule jointly in conjunction with the [[English Bill of Rights]] in 1688 (in the "[[Glorious Revolution]]"), from which emerged a church polity with an [[State religion|established church]] and a number of [[Nonconformism|non-conformist]] churches whose members at first suffered various [[civil disabilities]] that were removed over time. The legacy of the past Roman Catholic Establishment remained an issue for some time, and still exists today. A substantial minority remained Roman Catholic in England, and in an effort to disestablish it from British systems, their church organisation remained illegal [[Catholic Church in England and Wales#Nineteenth century|until the 19th century]].

==Background==

===Henry VIII: marriages and desire for a male heir===
[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger, Around 1497-1543 - Portrait of Henry VIII of England - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|King [[Henry VIII of England]] by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]. [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]], Madrid.]]
[[File:Catherine aragon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Catherine of Aragon]], Henry VIII's first wife. Attributed to [[Joannes Corvus]], [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].]]

[[Henry VIII]] acceded to the English throne in 1509 at the age of 17. He made a dynastic marriage with [[Catherine of Aragon]], widow of his brother [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], in June 1509, just before his coronation on [[Midsummer|Midsummer's Day]]. Unlike his [[Henry VII of England|father]], who was secretive and conservative, the young Henry appeared the epitome of chivalry and sociability. An observant [[Roman Catholic]], he heard up to five [[Mass (liturgy)|masses]] a day (except during the hunting season); of "powerful but unoriginal mind", he let himself be influenced by his advisors from whom he was never apart, by night or day. He was thus susceptible to whoever had his ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Susan |last=Brigden |author-link=Susan Brigden |title=New Worlds, Lost Worlds: The Rule of the Tudors, 1485–1603 |publisher=Allen Lane |date=2000 |quote=[He ...believed he that he could keep his own secrets... but he was often deceived and he deceived himself.] |page=103 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This contributed to a state of hostility between his young contemporaries and the [[Lord Chancellor]], Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]]. As long as Wolsey had his ear, Henry's Roman Catholicism was secure: in 1521, he had defended the Roman Catholic Church from [[Martin Luther]]'s accusations of [[heresy]] in a book he wrote—probably with considerable help from the conservative [[Bishop of Rochester]] [[John Fisher]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ryrie|first1=Alec|title=The Age of Reformation: The Tudor and Stewart Realms 1485–1603|date=2009|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Harlow|isbn=978-1405835572|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;—entitled ''The [[Defence of the Seven Sacraments]]'', for which he was awarded the title "Defender of the Faith" (''[[Fidei Defensor]]'') by [[Pope Leo X]]. (Successive English and British monarchs have retained this title to the present, even after the Anglican Church broke away from Roman Catholicism, in part because the title was re-conferred by Parliament in 1544, after the split.) Wolsey's enemies at court included those who had been influenced by [[Lutheran]] ideas,{{sfn|Brigden|2000|p=111}} among whom was the attractive, charismatic [[Anne Boleyn]].

Anne arrived at court in 1522 as [[maid of honour]] to Queen Catherine, having spent some years in France being educated by [[Queen Claude]] of France. She was a woman of "charm, style and wit, with will and savagery which made her a match for Henry."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brigden|2000|p=111}}. Her music book contained an illustration of a [[falcon]] pecking at a [[pomegranate]]: the falcon was her badge, the pomegranate, that of Granada, Catherine's badge.&lt;/ref&gt; Anne was a distinguished French conversationalist, singer, and dancer. She was cultured and is the disputed author of several songs and poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women of the English Renaissance and Reformation|last=Warnicke|first=Retha|publisher=Praeger|year=1983|isbn=|location=|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1527, Henry wanted his marriage to Catherine [[Declaration of nullity|annulled]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Marshall | first = Peter | title = Heretics and Believers: A History of the English Reformation | publisher = Yale University Press | page = 164 | date = 2017 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=M7S_DgAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 0300170629 | ref=harv}} "Henry wanted an annulment—a formal and legal declaration of the marriage's invalidity.

[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anne Boleyn]], Henry VIII's second wife, by an unknown artist. National Portrait Gallery, London.]]

Henry claimed that this lack of a male heir was because his marriage was "blighted in the eyes of God".&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Phillips, ''Untying the Knot: A Short History of Divorce'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991), p.&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine had been his [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|late brother]]'s wife, and it was therefore [[Affinity (canon law)#Mosaic law|against biblical teachings]] for Henry to have married her ([[Leviticus]] 20:21); a special [[dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] from [[Pope Julius II]] had been needed to allow the wedding in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lacey, ''The Life and Times of Henry VIII'', (Book Club Associates, 1972), p17&lt;/ref&gt; Henry argued the marriage was never valid because the biblical prohibition was part of unbreakable divine law, and even popes could not dispense with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 166–167}}: "Inconveniently for Henry, another Old Testament verse ([[Yibbum|Deut. 25:5]]) seemingly qualified the Levitical prohibition, commanding a man to take to wife his deceased brother's widow, if there had been no child."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1527, Henry asked [[Pope Clement VII]] to annul the marriage, but the Pope refused. According to [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], the pope could not annul a marriage on the basis of a [[canonical impediment]] previously dispensed. Clement also feared the wrath of Catherine's nephew, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], whose troops earlier that year had [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked Rome]] and briefly taken the Pope prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;T.&amp;nbsp;A.

===Parliamentary debate and legislation===
In 1529, the King summoned [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] to deal with annulment, thus bringing together those who wanted reform but who disagreed what form it should take; it became known as the [[English Reformation Parliament|Reformation Parliament]]. There were common lawyers who resented the privileges of the clergy to summon [[laity]] to their courts;{{Sfn| Haigh | p = 73}} there were those who had been influenced by Lutheranism and were hostile to the theology of Rome; [[Thomas Cromwell]] was both. Henry's chancellor, [[Thomas More]], successor to Wolsey, also wanted reform: he wanted new laws against heresy.{{sfn|Brigden|2000|p=116}}

[[File:Cromwell,Thomas(1EEssex)01.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex]] (c. 1485–1540), Henry VIII's chief minister 1532–40.]]
Cromwell was a lawyer and a member of Parliament—a Protestant who saw how Parliament could be used to advance the Royal Supremacy, which Henry wanted, and to further Protestant beliefs and practices Cromwell and his friends wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = MacCulloch | first = Diarmaid | author-link = Diarmaid MacCulloch | title = The Reformation: A History | publisher = Penguin Books | date = 2003 | page = 199 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dikJzCnL7eUC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 978-0-14-303538-1 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his closest friends was [[Thomas Cranmer]], soon to be made an [[archbishop]].

In the matter of the annulment, no progress seemed possible. The Pope seemed more afraid of Emperor Charles V than of Henry. Anne and Cromwell and their allies wished simply to ignore the Pope, but in October 1530 a meeting of clergy and lawyers advised that Parliament could not empower the archbishop to act against the Pope's prohibition. Henry thus resolved to bully the [[priest]]s.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | pp = 105–106}}

===Actions by Henry against English clergy===
Having brought down his chancellor, Cardinal Wolsey, Henry VIII finally resolved to charge the whole English clergy with praemunire to secure their agreement to his annulment. The [[Statute of Praemunire]], which forbade obedience to the authority of the Pope or of any foreign rulers, enacted in 1392, had been used against individuals in the ordinary course of court proceedings. Now Henry, having first charged Queen Catherine's supporters, Bishops [[John Fisher]], [[Nicholas West]] and [[Henry Standish]] and [[Archdeacon of Exeter]], Adam Travers, decided to proceed against the whole clergy.&lt;ref&gt;T.&amp;nbsp;A. Morris, ''Europe and England in the Sixteenth century'', (Routledge, 1998), p.&amp;nbsp;172.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry claimed £100,000 from the [[Convocation of the English Clergy|Convocation]] of [[Province of Canterbury|Canterbury]] (a representative body of English clergy) for their pardon, which was granted by the Convocation on 24 January 1531. The clergy wanted the payment spread over five years, but Henry refused. The convocation responded by withdrawing their payment altogether and demanded Henry fulfill certain guarantees before they would give him the money. Henry refused these conditions. He agreed only to the five-year period of payment and added five articles that specified that:
# The clergy recognise Henry as the "sole protector and Supreme Head of the Church and clergy of England"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tanner | first = J. R. | author-link = Joseph Robson Tanner | title = Tudor Constitutional Documents A.D. 1485–1603: With an Historical Commentary | publisher = Cambridge University Press | edition = 2nd | date = 1930 | page = 17 | isbn = 1107679400 | ref=harv}}. Tanner gives this as "their singular protector, only and supreme lord, and, as far as the law of Christ allows, even Supreme Head".&lt;/ref&gt;
# The King had spiritual [[jurisdiction]]
# The privileges of the Church were upheld only if they did not detract from the [[royal prerogative]] and the laws of the realm
# The King pardoned the clergy for violating the statute of praemunire, and
# The laity were also pardoned.

In Parliament, Bishop Fisher championed Catherine and the clergy; he had inserted into the first article the phrase "...as far as the word of God allows..."{{Sfn|Brigden|2000|p=118}}{{Sfn|Tanner|1930}}{{page needed|date=September 2018}} In Convocation, however, [[William Warham]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], requested a discussion but was met by a stunned silence; then Warham said, "He who is silent seems to consent," to which a clergyman responded, "Then we are all silent." The Convocation granted consent to the King's five articles and the payment on 8 March 1531. That same year, Parliament passed the Pardon to Clergy Act 1531.

===Further legislative acts===
The breaking of the power of Rome proceeded little by little. In 1532, Cromwell brought before Parliament the ''[[Supplication Against the Ordinaries]]'', which listed nine grievances against the Church, including abuses of power and Convocation's independent legislative power. Finally, on 10 May, the King demanded of Convocation that the Church renounce all authority to make laws. On 15 May, the [[Submission of the Clergy]] was subscribed, which recognised [[Acts of Supremacy|Royal Supremacy]] over the Church so that it could no longer make canon law without royal licence—i.e., without the King's permission—thus emasculating it as a law-making body. (Parliament subsequently passed this in 1534 and again in 1536.) The day after this, More resigned as chancellor, leaving Cromwell as Henry's chief minister. (Cromwell never became chancellor. His power came—and was lost—through his informal relations with Henry.)

Several acts of Parliament then followed. The Act in Conditional Restraint of Annates proposed that the clergy pay no more than 5 percent of their first year's revenue ([[annates]]) to Rome. This was initially controversial and required that Henry visit the [[House of Lords]] three times to browbeat the [[House of Commons of England|Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;After prolonged debate in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], it was clear they would not reach unanimity over the Bill—so Henry ordered a division. He commanded those in favour of his success and the "welfare of the realm" to one side of the House, and those who opposed him and the Bill to the other. Thus, he obtained a majority.&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=December 2018}}

[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger - Sir Thomas More - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas More]], with [[John Fisher]] the leader of political resistance against the break with Rome. Both were executed in 1535.]]

The [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals|Act in Restraint of Appeals]], drafted by Cromwell, apart from outlawing appeals to Rome on ecclesiastical matters, declared that

{{quote|This realm of England is an Empire, and so hath been accepted in the world, governed by one Supreme Head and King having the dignity and royal estate of the Imperial Crown of the same, unto whom a body politic compact of all sorts and degrees of people divided in terms and by names of Spirituality and Temporality, be bounden and owe to bear next to God a natural and humble obedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Elton | first = G.

This declared England an independent country in every respect. English historian [[Geoffrey Elton]] called this act an "essential ingredient" of the "Tudor revolution" in that it expounded a theory of [[national sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Elton | first = G.

Finally in 1534, the [[Acts of Supremacy]] made Henry "supreme head in earth of the Church of England" and disregarded any "usage, custom, foreign laws, foreign authority [or] prescription".{{Sfn|Elton|1982|pp=364–365}}

Meanwhile, having taken Anne to France on a pre-nuptial honeymoon, Henry married her in [[Westminster Abbey]] in January 1533. This was made easier by the death of Archbishop Warham, a strong opponent of an annulment. Henry appointed Thomas Cranmer to succeed him as Archbishop of Canterbury. Cranmer was prepared to grant the annulment of the marriage to Catherine as Henry required, going so far as to pronounce the judgment that Henry's marriage with Catherine was against the law of God on 23 May.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, pp. 59–63&lt;/ref&gt; Anne gave birth to a daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]], in September 1533. The Pope responded to the marriage by [[Excommunication#The Catholic Church|excommunicating]] both Henry and Cranmer from the Roman Catholic Church (11 July 1533).&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia, [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07222a.htm Henry VIII]. Accessed 21 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry was excommunicated again in December 1538.

Consequently, in the same year the Act of First Fruits and Tenths transferred the taxes on ecclesiastical income from the Pope to the Crown. The [[Act Concerning Peter's Pence and Dispensations]] outlawed the annual payment by landowners of [[Peter's Pence|one penny]] to the Pope. This Act also reiterated that England had "no superior under God, but only your Grace" and that Henry's "imperial crown" had been diminished by "the unreasonable and uncharitable usurpations and exactions" of the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford E. Lehmberg, ''The Reformation Parliament, 1529–1536'' (Cambridge University Press, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

In case any of this should be resisted, Parliament passed the [[Treasons Act 1534]], which made it high treason punishable by death to deny Royal Supremacy. The following year, Thomas More and John Fisher were executed under this legislation. Finally, in 1536, Parliament passed the [[Act against the Pope's Authority]], which removed the last part of papal authority still legal. This was Rome's power in England to decide disputes concerning [[Scripture]].

== Early reform movements ==
{{History of Christianity in England}}

The break with Rome was not, by itself, a Reformation.&lt;ref name=scruton1996p470/&gt; However, the political break with Rome was inseparable from the success of Protestantism. English Catholicism was strong and popular in the early 1500s, and while there were those who held Protestant sympathies, they would have remained a religious minority if political events had not intervened.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 20,28}}

An earlier reform movement that anticipated some Protestant teachings but remained outside the religious mainstream was [[Lollardy]]. Derived from the writings of [[John Wycliffe]], a 14th-century theologian and Bible translator, Lollardy stressed the [[prima scriptura|primacy of Scripture]] and emphasised the [[sermon|preaching of the word]] over the [[Eucharist|sacrament of the altar]], holding the latter to be but a [[Memorialism|memorial]].{{sfn|Brigden|2000|p=86f}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Duffy | first = Eamon | author-link = | title = The Stripping of the Altars: Traditional Religion in England, c. 1400 – c. 1580 | publisher = Yale University Press | edition = 2nd | date = 2005 | orig-year = 1992 | pages = xxi–xxii| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=K48k6JIcPrUC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 978-0-300-10828-6 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Protestants, the early Lollards lacked access to the [[printing press]] and failed to gain a foothold among the church's most popular communicators, the [[friar]]s. Unable to gain access to the levers of power, the Lollards were much reduced in numbers and influence by the 15th century. They sometimes faced investigation and persecution and rarely produced new literature after 1450.{{Sfn|MacCulloch|2003|p=36}} Lollards could still be found—especially in London and the [[Thames Valley]], in [[Essex]] and [[Kent]], [[Coventry]], [[Bristol]] and even in the [[Northern England|North]]—and many would be receptive to Protestant ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens AG, ''Lollards and Protestants in the Diocese of York 1509–1558'' (London 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

More respectable and orthodox calls for reform came from [[Renaissance humanists]], such as [[Erasmus]] (who lived in England for a time), [[John Colet]], [[Dean of St Paul's]], and Thomas More. Humanists downplayed the role of rites and ceremonies in achieving salvation and criticised the superstitious veneration of [[relic]]s. Erasmus and Colet emphasised a simple, personal piety and a return ''[[ad fontes]]'', back to the sources of Christian faith—the scriptures as understood through textual and linguistic scholarship.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 29–32}} Colet's commentaries on the [[Pauline epistles]] emphasized [[double predestination]] and the worthlessness of human works. Anne Boleyn's own religious views were shaped by French humanists such as [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]], whose 1512 commentaries on Paul's epistles stated that human works were irrelevant to [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] five years before Luther published the same views.{{Sfn|MacCulloch|2003|pp=112–111}}{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 164}}

Humanist scholarship provided arguments against [[papal primacy]] and support for the claim that popes had usurped powers that rightfully belonged to kings. In 1534, [[Lorenzo Valla]]'s ''On the [[Donation of Constantine]]''—which proved that one of the pillars of the papacy's temporal authority was a hoax—was published in London. Cromwell paid for an English translation of [[Marsiglio of Padua]]'s ''[[Defensor pacis]]'' in 1535. The conservative [[Stephen Gardiner]] used Marsiglio's theory of a unitary realm to defend the royal supremacy.{{Sfn|Haigh | 1993 | p = 123}}

By the early 1520s, the views of German reformer [[Martin Luther]] were known and disputed in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = MacCulloch | first = Diarmaid | title = Thomas Cranmer: A Life | publisher = Yale University Press | date = 1996 | location = London | pages = 27 | isbn = 0-300-06688-0 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main plank of [[Theology of Martin Luther|Luther's theology]] was [[sola fide|justification by faith alone]] rather than by [[Merit (Christianity)|good works]]. In this view, only [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], itself a gift from God, can secure the [[Grace in Christianity|grace]] of God. Justification by faith alone threatened the whole basis of the Roman Catholic [[Sacrament of Penance|penitential system]] with its doctrine of [[purgatory]], [[prayer for the dead]], [[indulgence]]s, and the [[Sacrifice|sacrificial]] character of the [[Mass in the Catholic Church|mass]].{{Sfn|MacCulloch|2003|pp=119–122,130}}{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 126}} Early Protestants portrayed Catholic practices such as confession to priests, [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]], and requirements to [[Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church|fast]] and keep vows as burdensome and spiritually oppressive. Not only did purgatory lack any biblical basis according to Protestants, but the clergy were accused of using fear of purgatory to make money from prayers and masses. Catholics countered that justification by faith alone was a "licence to sin".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 146}}  

Protestant ideas were popular among some parts of the English population, especially among academics and merchants with connections to continental Europe.{{Sfn|MacCulloch|2003|pp=202–203}} The first open demonstration of support for Luther took place at [[Cambridge]] in 1521 when a student defaced a copy of the [[Exsurge Domine|papal bull of condemnation]] against Luther.{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 124}} Also at Cambridge was a group of reform-minded university students that met at the White Horse tavern from the mid-1520s, known by the moniker "Little Germany". Its members included [[Robert Barnes (martyr)|Robert Barnes]], [[Hugh Latimer]], [[John Frith]], [[Thomas Bilney]], [[George Joye]] and [[Thomas Arthur (dramatist)|Thomas Arthur]].{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 58}}

[[File:Tyndale Bible Stevage.jpeg|right|thumb|The Tyndale Bible was the basis for later English translations.]]

The publication of [[William Tyndale]]'s English New Testament in 1526 helped to spread Protestant ideas. Printed abroad and smuggled into the country, the [[Tyndale Bible]] was the first English Bible to be mass produced; there were probably 16,000 copies in England by 1536. Tyndale's translation was highly influential, forming the basis of all later English translations.{{Sfn|MacCulloch|2003|p=203}} An attack on traditional religion, Tyndale's translation included an epilogue explaining Luther's theology of justification by faith, and many translation choices were designed to undermine traditional Catholic teachings. Tyndale translated the Greek word ''charis'' as ''favour'' rather than ''grace'' to de-emphasize the role of grace-giving sacraments. His choice of ''love'' rather than ''charity'' to translate ''[[agape]]'' de-emphasized good works. When rendering the Greek verb ''[[Metanoia (theology)|metanoeite]]'' into English, Tyndale used ''[[Repentance (Christianity)|repent]]'' rather than ''do penance''. The former word indicated an internal turning to God, while the latter translation supported the sacrament of confession.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 132}} 

As chancellor, Thomas More pursued an aggressive campaign against heresy. Between 1530 and 1533, [[Thomas Hitton]] (England's first Protestant martyr), Thomas Bilney, [[Richard Bayfield]], [[John Tewkesbury]], [[James Bainham]], [[Thomas Benet (martyr)|Thomas Benet]], [[Thomas Harding]], John Frith and Andrew Hewet were burned to death.{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 186}} In 1531, [[William Tracy (JP)|William Tracy]] was posthumously convicted of heresy for denying purgatory and affirming justification by faith, and his corpse was disinterred and burned.{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | p = 188}}

While Protestants were only a small portion of the population, the growing rift between the King and papacy gave Protestants a new sense of confidence. Heretical ideas were openly discussed, and militant [[iconoclasm]] was seen in Essex and Suffolk between 1531 and 1532.{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | pp = 189–190}} Because they tended to oppose royal supremacy, traditionalists were on the defensive, while Protestants found opportunities to form new alliances with government officials.{{Sfn | Marshall | 2017 | pp = 203–204}}

== Henrician Reformation ==
=== Moderate reform ===
[[File:Thomas Cranmer by Gerlach Flicke.jpg|right|thumb|[[Thomas Cranmer]] (1489–1556), Henry VIII's Archbishop of Canterbury and editor and co-author of the first and second [[Book of Common Prayer|Books of Common Prayer]].]]

In order to promote and defend the Royal Supremacy, Henry VIII embraced the language of the continental Reformation and relied on men with Protestant sympathies, such as Thomas Cromwell and Thomas Cranmer, to carry out his religious program. The King's personal religious views, however, remained largely traditional. Historian [[George W. Bernard|G. W. Bernard]] writes that Henry's religious policies were purposely ambiguous in order to foster religious compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bernard | first = G. W. | author-link = George W. Bernard | title = The Church of England c.1529–c.1642 | journal = History | volume = 75 | issue = 244 | page = 185 | publisher = Wiley | date = June 1990 | jstor = 24420971 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 1529, Henry VIII was using the language of reform openly—speaking of Rome's "vain and superfluous ceremonies" and blaming the papacy for numerous wars and heresies. At Anne Boleyn's urging, he was also reading Protestant books, such as [[Simon Fish]]'s ''Supplication for the Beggars'' and Tyndale's ''[[The Obedience of a Christian Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Marshall | 2017 | p = 176–177,179}}: Borrowing from Luther, Tyndale argued that papal and clerical claims to independent power were unscriptural and that the king's "law is God's law". In 1531, Henry sought, through [[Robert Barnes (martyr)|Robert Barnes]], Luther's opinion on his annulment; the theologian did not approve.&lt;/ref&gt; After Warham's death, Cranmer was made Archbishop of Canterbury (with papal consent) in 1533.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 205}} Cranmer's shift to Protestantism was borne partly by his membership of the team negotiating for the annulment, finally came through his stay with [[Andreas Osiander]] in [[Nuremberg]] in 1532. (Cranmer also secretly married Osiander's niece.){{Sfn| MacCulloch | 1996 | p = 69}} Even then the position was complicated by the fact that Lutherans were not in favour of the annulment. Cranmer (and Henry) felt obliged to seek assistance from [[Strasbourg]] and [[Basel]], which brought him into contact with the more radical ideas associated with [[Huldrych Zwingli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| MacCulloch | 1996 | pp = 60f}}: Martin Bucer of Strasbourg was one of the European theologians who influenced Cranmer and the second prayer book, while Simon Grynaeus of Basel gave Cranmer his introduction to Swiss Calvinistic thought.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1534, a new Heresy Act ensured that no one could be punished for speaking against the pope and also made it more difficult to convict someone of heresy; however, [[sacramentarian]]s and [[Anabaptist]]s continued to be vigorously persecuted.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 208,221}} What followed was a period of doctrinal confusion as both conservatives and reformers attempted to shape the church's future direction.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 238}} The reformers were aided by Cromwell. In January 1535, the King made Cromwell his [[vicegerent]] in spirituals. Effectively the King's [[vicar general]], Cromwell's authority was greater than that of bishops. Even the Archbishop of Canterbury answered to Cromwell.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 215}} Largely due to Anne Boleyn's influence, a number of Protestants were appointed bishops between 1534 and 1536. These included Latimer, [[Thomas Goodrich]], [[John Salcot]], [[Nicholas Shaxton]], [[William Barlow (bishop of Chichester)|William Barlow]], [[John Hilsey]] and [[Edward Foxe]].{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 216–217}} Protestant bishops remained a minority, however.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 218}}

Cromwell's programme, assisted by Anne Boleyn's influence over episcopal appointments, was not merely against the clergy and the power of Rome. He persuaded Henry that safety from political alliances that Rome might attempt to bring together lay in negotiations with the German Lutheran princes of the [[Schmalkaldic League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Brigden |2000 | p = 107}}: Henry was no innocent: he sought influence in European affairs and, in pursuance of it, his relationship with the French was ambivalent and essentially treacherous.&lt;/ref&gt; There also seemed to be a possibility that Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, might act to avenge his rejected aunt (Queen Catherine) and enforce the Pope's excommunication. The negotiations did not lead to an alliance, but it brought Lutheran ideas to England.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 125}}

In 1536, Convocation adopted the first doctrinal statement for the Church of England, the [[Thirty-nine Articles#Ten Articles (1536)|Ten Articles]]. This was followed by the ''[[Thirty-nine Articles#Bishops' Book (1537)|Bishops' Book]]'' in 1537. These established a semi-Lutheran doctrine for the church. Justification by faith, qualified by an emphasis on good works following justification, was a core teaching. The traditional seven [[sacrament]]s were reduced to three only—[[baptism]], [[Eucharist]] and [[penance]]. Catholic teaching on [[Intercession of saints|praying to saints]], purgatory and the use of [[Religious images in Christian theology|images]] in worship was undermined.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 254–256}} 

[[File:StPaul'sCross.jpg|right|thumb|St Paul's Cross (in the lower left corner of the painting) was a prominent [[preaching cross]] on the grounds of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]].]]

In August 1536, the same month the Ten Articles were published, Cromwell issued a set of Royal Injunctions to the clergy. Minor [[Calendar of saints|feast days]] were changed into normal work days, including those celebrating a [[Dedications in the Church of England|church's patron saint]] and most feasts during harvest time (July through September). The rationale was partly economic as too many holidays led to a loss of productivity and were "the occasion of vice and idleness".{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 129}} In addition, Protestants considered feast days to be examples of superstition.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 241}} Clergy were to discourage [[pilgrimage]]s and instruct the people to give to the poor rather than make offerings to images. The clergy were also ordered to place Bibles in both English and Latin in every church for the people to read.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 130}} This last requirement was largely ignored by the bishops for a year or more due the lack of any authorised English translation. The only complete vernacular version was the [[Coverdale Bible]] finished in 1535 and based on Tyndale's earlier work. It lacked royal approval, however.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 241–242}}

Historian [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]] in his study of ''The Later Reformation in England, 1547–1603'' argues that after 1537, "England's Reformation was characterized by its hatred of images, as [[Margaret Aston]]'s work on iconoclasm and [[iconophobia]] has repeatedly and eloquently demonstrated."&lt;ref&gt;Diarmaid MacCulloch, ''The Later Reformation in England, 1547–1603'' (2nd ed. 2001) p 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1538, the famous [[Rood of Grace]] was condemned as a mechanical fraud and destroyed at [[St Paul's Cross]]. In July, the statues of [[Our Lady of Walsingham]], [[Our Lady of Ipswich]], and other Marian images were burned at [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] on Cromwell's orders. In September, Cromwell issued a second set of Royal Injunctions ordering the destruction of images to which pilgrimage offerings were made, the prohibition of lighting candles before images of saints, and the preaching of sermons against the veneration of images and relics. He once again instructed each parish to acquire an English Bible.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 134}}

===Dissolution of the monasteries===
[[File:Fichale.jpg|thumb|right|Remains of [[Finchale Priory]], a Benedictine monastery near Durham that was closed in 1535]]
{{Main|Dissolution of the Monasteries}}

For Cromwell and Cranmer, a step in the Protestant agenda was attacking [[monasticism]], which was associated with the doctrine of purgatory.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 131}} While the King was not opposed to [[religious house]]s on theological grounds, there was concern over the loyalty of the monastic orders, which were international in character and resistant to the Royal Supremacy.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2018 | p = 226}} The [[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscan Observant]] houses were closed in August 1534 after that order refused to repudiate papal authority. Between 1535 and 1537, 18 [[Carthusian]]s were killed for doing the same.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 141}}  

The Crown was also experiencing financial difficulties, and the wealth of the church, in contrast to its political weakness, made confiscation of church property both tempting and feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Herbert Maynard | author-link = | title = Pre-Reformation England | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | date = 1938 | location = London | pages = vii | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Zo6wCwAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 9781349004065 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seizure of monastic wealth was not unprecedented; it had happened before in 1295, 1337, and 1369.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 131}} The Church owned between one-fifth and one-third of the land in all England; Cromwell realised that he could bind the [[Landed gentry|gentry]] and nobility to Royal Supremacy by selling to them the huge amount of Church lands, and that any reversion to pre-Royal Supremacy would entail upsetting many of the powerful people in the realm.{{Sfn|Elton|1991|p=142}} 

In 1534, Cromwell initiated a [[Dissolution of the Monasteries#Visitation of the monasteries|visitation of the monasteries]] ostensibly to examine their character, but in fact, to value their assets with a view to expropriation.{{Sfn| Smith | 1938 | p = vii}} The visiting commissioners claimed to have uncovered sexual immorality and financial impropriety amongst the [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s, which became the ostensible justification for their suppression.{{Sfn|Elton|1991|p=142}} There were also reports of the possession and display of false relics, such as [[Hailes Abbey]]'s vial of the [[Blood of Christ|Holy Blood]], upon investigation announced to be "honey clarified and coloured with saffron".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2018 | p = 269}} The ''[[Compendium Competorum]]'' compiled by the visitors documented ten pieces of the [[True Cross]], seven portions of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]'s milk and numerous saints' girdles.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2018 | p = 229}}

Leading reformers, led by Anne Boleyn, wanted to convert monasteries into "places of study and good letters, and to the continual relief of the poor", but this was not done.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2018 | p = 232}} In 1536, the [[Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535|Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act]] closed smaller houses valued at less than £200 a year.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 130}} Henry used the revenue to help build coastal defences (''see [[Device Forts]]'') against expected invasion, and all the land was given to the Crown or sold to the aristocracy.{{Additional citation needed|date= September 2018 |reason= Coastal defences are not mentioned in Haigh.}} Thirty-four houses were saved by paying for exemptions. Monks and nuns affected by closures were transferred to larger houses, and monks had the option of becoming [[secular clergy]].{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | pp = 144–145}}

[[File:The Chapel, Forde Abbey - geograph.org.uk - 1287934.jpg|thumb|right|The [[chapter house]] of [[Forde Abbey]], a Cistercian monastery closed in 1539 and converted into a country house]]

The Royal Supremacy and the abolition of papal authority had not caused widespread unrest, but the attacks on monasteries and the abolition of saints' days and pilgrimages provoked violence. Mobs attacked those sent to break up monastic buildings. Suppression commissioners were attacked by local people in several places.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | pp = 143–144}} In [[Northern England]], there were a series of uprisings against the dissolutions in late 1536 and early 1537. The [[Lincolnshire Rising]] occurred in October 1536 and culminated in a force of 40,000 rebels assembling at [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]]. They demanded an end to taxation during peacetime, the repeal of the [[statute of uses]], an end to the suppression of monasteries, and that heresy be purged and heretics punished. Henry refused to negotiate, and the revolt collapsed as the nervous gentry convinced the common people to disperse.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | pp = 145–146}} 

The [[Pilgrimage of Grace]] was a more serious matter. The revolt began in October at [[Yorkshire]] and spread to the other northern counties. Around 50,000 strong, the rebels under [[Robert Aske (political leader)|Robert Aske]]'s leadership restored 16 of the 26 northern monasteries that had been dissolved. Due to the size of the rebellion, the King was persuaded to negotiate. In December, the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] offered the rebels a pardon and a parliament to consider their grievances. Aske then sent the rebels home. The promises made to them, however, were ignored by the King, and Norfolk was instructed to put the rebellion down. Forty-seven of the Lincolnshire rebels were executed, and 132 from the Pilgrimage of Grace. In [[Southern England]], smaller disturbances took place in [[Cornwall]] and [[Walsingham]] in 1537.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | pp = 147–149}}

The failure of the Pilgrimage of Grace only sped up the process of dissolution and may have convinced Henry VIII that all religious houses needed to be closed. In 1540, the last monasteries were dissolved, wiping out an important element of traditional religion.{{Sfn|MacCulloch|2003|p=201}} Former monks were given modest pensions from the [[Court of Augmentations]], and those that could sought work as parish priests. Former nuns received smaller pensions and, as they were still bound by vows of chastity, forbidden to marry.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2018 | p = 282}} Henry personally devised a plan to form at least thirteen new dioceses so that most counties had one based on a former monastery (or more than one), though this scheme was only partly carried out. New dioceses were established at [[Bristol]], [[Gloucester]], [[Oxford]], [[Peterborough]], [[Diocese of Westminster (Church of England)|Westminster]] and [[Chester]], but not, for instance, at [[Shrewsbury]], [[Leicester]] or [[Waltham Abbey (abbey)|Waltham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mackie | first = J.

===Reformation reversed===
According to historian [[Peter Marshall (historian)|Peter Marshall]], Henry's religious reforms were based on the principles of "unity, obedience and the refurbishment of ancient truth."{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 266}} Yet, the outcome was disunity and disobedience. Impatient Protestants took it upon themselves to further reform. Priests said mass in English rather than Latin and were marrying in violation of [[clerical celibacy]]. Not only were there divisions between traditionalists and reformers, but Protestants themselves were divided between establishment reformers who held Lutheran beliefs and radicals who held Anabaptist and Sacramentarian views.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 269–270}} Reports of dissension from every part of England reached Cromwell daily—developments he tried to hide from the King.{{sfn|Brigden|2000|p=132}} 

In September 1538, Bishop [[Stephen Gardiner]], a leading conservative, returned to England from three years in France. Almost immediately, official religious policy began to drift in a conservative direction.{{Sfn| MacCulloch | 1996 | p = 229}} This was due in part to the eagerness of establishment Protestants to disassociate themselves from religious radicals. In September, two Lutheran princes, the [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]] and [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Landgrave of Hesse]], sent warnings of Anabaptist activity in England. A commission was swiftly created to seek out Anabaptists.{{Sfn| MacCulloch | 1996 | p = 231}} 

Henry personally presided at the trial of [[John Lambert (Protestant martyr)|John Lambert]] in November 1538 for denying the [[real presence]] of Christ in the Eucharist. At the same time, he shared in the drafting of a proclamation ordering Anabaptists and Sacramentaries to get out of the country or face death. Discussion of the real presence (except by those educated in the universities) was forbidden, and priests who married were to be dismissed.{{sfn|Brigden|2000|p=132}}{{Sfn| MacCulloch | 1996 | p = 233}} It was becoming clear that the King's views on religion differed from those of Cromwell and Cranmer. Henry made his traditional preferences known during the [[Easter Triduum]] of 1539, where he crept to the cross on [[Good Friday]].{{Sfn | MacCulloch | 1996 | p = 241}} Later that year, Parliament passed the [[Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]] reaffirming Roman Catholic beliefs and practices such as [[transubstantiation]], clerical celibacy, [[Confession (religion)|confession]] to a priest, [[votive mass]]es, and withholding [[communion wine]] from the laity.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 153}}

On 28 June 1540 Cromwell, Henry's longtime advisor and loyal servant, was executed. Different reasons were advanced: that Cromwell would not enforce the Act of Six Articles; that he had supported Robert Barnes, Hugh Latimer and other heretics; and that he was responsible for Henry's marriage to [[Anne of Cleves]], his fourth wife. Many other arrests under the Act followed.{{sfn|Brigden|2000|p=135}} On 30 July, the reformers Barnes, [[William Jerome]] and [[Thomas Gerrard]] were burned at the stake. In a display of religious impartiality, [[Thomas Abell]], [[Richard Featherstone]] and [[Edward Powell]]—all Roman Catholics—were [[hanged and quartered]] while the Protestants burned.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 280–281}} European observers were shocked and bewildered. French diplomat [[Charles de Marillac]] wrote that Henry's religious policy was a "climax of evils" and that:  

{{quote|[I]t is difficult to have a people entirely opposed to new errors which does not hold with the ancient authority of the Church and of the Holy See, or, on the other hand, hating the Pope, which does not share some opinions with the Germans. Yet the government will not have either the one or the other, but insists on their keeping what is commanded, which is so often altered that it is difficult to understand what it is.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 281}}}}

[[File:Chantry Chapel, Wakefield Bridge (7568910296).jpg|thumb|right|The 14th-century [[Chantry Chapel of St Mary the Virgin, Wakefield|Chantry Chapel of St Mary the Virgin]] in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Chantries were endowments that paid priests to say [[Requiem|masses for the dead]] to lessen their time in purgatory.]]

Despite setbacks, Protestants managed to win some victories. In May 1541, the King ordered copies of the [[Great Bible]] to be placed in all churches; failure to comply would result in a £2 fine. Protestants could celebrate the growing access to vernacular scripture as most churches had Bibles by 1545. The King also continued to endorse the iconoclastic policies of 1538 and was angry over the North's continued attachment to shrines and pilgrimage.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 284}}{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 158}} Furthermore, Cranmer survived formal charges of heresy in the [[Prebendaries' Plot]] of 1543.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 286–287}} 

Traditionalists, nevertheless, seemed to have the upper hand. By the spring of 1543, Protestant innovations had been reversed, and only the break with Rome and the dissolution of the monasteries remained unchanged.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 161}} In May 1543, a new formulary was published to replace the ''Bishops' Book''. This ''[[King's Book]]'' rejected justification by faith alone and defended traditional ceremonies and the use of images.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 160}} This was followed days later by passage of the [[Act for the Advancement of True Religion]], which restricted Bible reading to men and women of noble birth. Henry expressed his fears to Parliament in 1545 that "the Word of God, is disputed, rhymed, sung and jangled in every ale house and tavern, contrary to the true meaning and doctrine of the same."&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, A.G. ''Reformation and Society'' (Thames and Hudson 1966) p.&amp;nbsp;103&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the spring of 1544, the conservatives appeared to be losing influence once again. In March, Parliament made it more difficult to prosecute people for violating the Six Articles. Protestants achieved small victories with the authorisation of Cranmer's English [[Litany]] in June 1544 and a ''King's Primer'' in May 1545, which became the only authorised prayer book in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt| Haigh | 1993 | p = 162}} argues that the Litany and ''Primer'' were largely traditional devotions and that the popularity of the ''Primer'' "suggest a continued vitality in conventional religion." {{harvtxt| Marshall | 2017 | pp = 291, 293}}, however, argues that both the Litany and ''Primer'' were reformed in outlook, especially in their reduced emphasis on the invocation of saints. They were successful, he writes, in "taking an old-fashioned form and subverting its traditional purposes."&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of the conservative [[Edward Lee (bishop)|Edward Lee]] in September 1544, the Protestant [[Robert Holgate]] replaced him as Archbishop of York.{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 292}} In December 1545, the King was empowered to seize the property of [[chantries]] (endowments created to provide [[Requiem|masses for the dead]]). While Henry's motives were largely financial (England was at war with France and desperately in need of funds), the passage of the Chantries Act was "an indication of how deeply the doctrine of purgatory had been eroded and discredited".{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 294}}

In 1546, the conservatives were once again in the ascendent. A series of controversial sermons preached by the Protestant [[Edward Crome]] set off a persecution of Protestants that the traditionalists used to effectively target their rivals. It was during this time that [[Anne Askew]] was tortured in the [[Tower of London]] and burnt at the stake. Even Henry's last wife, [[Katherine Parr]], was suspected of heresy but saved herself by appealing to the King's mercy. With the Protestants on the defensive, traditionalists pressed their advantange by banning Protestant books.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | pp = 165–166}} 

The conservative persecution of Queen Katherine, however, backfired.{{Sfn| MacCulloch | 1996 | p = 356}} By November 1546, there were already signs that religious policy was once again tilting towards Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt| MacCulloch | 1996 | pp = 356–357}} argues that Cranmer believed that, had he lived, Henry would have pursued a radical iconoclastic policy and a transformation of the mass into a Protestant communion service.&lt;/ref&gt; The King's will provided for a [[regency]] council to rule after his death, which would have been dominated by traditionalists, such as the Duke of Norfolk, Lord Chancellor [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Wriothesly]], Bishop Gardiner and Bishop [[Cuthbert Tunstall|Tunstall]].{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 166}} After a dispute with the King, Bishop Gardiner, the leading conservative churchman, was disgraced and removed as a councilor. Later, the Duke of Norfolk, the most powerful conservative nobleman, was arrested.{{Sfn| MacCulloch | 1996 | p = 359}} By the time Henry died in 1547, the Protestant [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]], brother of [[Jane Seymour]], Henry's third wife (and therefore uncle to the future Edward VI), managed—by a number of alliances with influential Protestants such as [[John Dudley|Lord Lisle]]—to gain control over the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]].{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | pp = 166–167}}

==Edward's Reformation==
[[File:Portrait of Edward VI of England.jpg|thumb|King Edward VI of England, in whose reign the reform of the Anglican Church moved in a more Protestant direction.]]
When Henry died in 1547, his nine-year-old son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], inherited the throne. Edward was a precocious child who had been brought up as a Protestant, but was initially of little account politically.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, Diarmaid.  ''The Boy King'' University of California Press (2002) pp. 35ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Marshall | 2017 | p = 291}}: Edward's tutors included the reformers [[John Cheke]], [[Richard Cox (bishop)|Richard Cox]] and [[Roger Ascham]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]] was made Lord Protector. He was commissioned as virtual regent with near sovereign powers. Now made [[Duke of Somerset]], he proceeded at first hesitantly, partly because his powers were not unchallenged. When he acted it was because he saw the political advantage in doing so.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 169}}

&lt;!-- Iconoclasm--the destruction of images and statues, was widespread and attracted popular action.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Aston, ''England's Iconoclasts: Volume I: Laws Against Images'' (1988) &lt;/ref&gt; what is this saying exactly? "popular action" was still discouraged; the local authorities, lay and church, were meant to take the action.  Don't reference to a whole book. page #s needed. --&gt;The 1547 injunctions against images were a more tightly drawn version of those of 1538, but they were more fiercely enforced, at first informally, and then by instruction. All images in churches were to be dismantled. [[Stained glass]], [[shrines]] and statues were defaced or destroyed. [[Rood]]s, and often their lofts and screens, were cut down and bells were taken down. [[Vestments]] were prohibited and either burned or sold. [[Chalice (cup)|Chalices]] were melted down or sold.&lt;ref name= Duffy480-485&gt;{{harvnb| Duffy | 2005 | p = 480–485}}. Among many examples: in [[Haddenham, Cambridgeshire]], a chalice, [[paten]] and processional cross were sold and the proceeds devoted to flood defences; in the wealthy Rayleigh parish, £10 worth of plate was sold to pay for the cost of the required reforms—the need to buy a parish chest, Bible and communion table.&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement of the clergy to be [[clerical celibacy|celibate]] was lifted. Processions were banned and ashes and palms were prohibited.{{Sfn| Duffy | 2005 | p = 461}} [[Chantry|Chantries]] (endowments to provide masses for the dead) were abolished completely. How well this was received is disputed. Modern historian [[Arthur Geoffrey Dickens|A.G. Dickens]] contends that people had "...ceased to believe in intercessory masses for souls in purgatory",&lt;ref&gt;''The English Reformation'' (2nd ed. 1989) p.&amp;nbsp;235&lt;/ref&gt; while others, such as [[Eamon Duffy]], argue that the demolition of chantry chapels and the removal of images coincided with the activity of royal visitors.{{Sfn| Duffy | 2005 | p = 481}} The evidence is often ambiguous.&lt;ref name= Duffy481&gt;{{harvnb| Duffy | 2005 | p = 481}}: In Ludlow in Shropshire the parishioners complied with the orders to remove the rood and other images in 1547, and in that same year spent money on making up the canopy to be carried over the Blessed Sacrament on the feast of Corpus Christi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1549 Cranmer introduced a [[Book of Common Prayer]] in English, which while to all appearances kept the structure of the Mass, altered the theology so that the holy gifts of consecrated bread and wine were not offered to God as a sacrifice although he was well aware that this had been the Church's doctrine since the late 2nd century (it would be restored by Scottish non-Jurors of the Episcopal Church of Scotland and the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States in 1789). In 1550 stone altars were replaced by wooden communion tables, a very public break with the past, as it changed the look and focus of church interiors.{{Sfn| Duffy | 2005 | p = 472}}

Less visible, but still influential, was the new ordinal—which provided for Protestant ministers rather than Roman Catholic priests, an admittedly conservative adaptation of Bucer's draft;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| MacCulloch | 1996 | p = 461}}: Bucer had provided for only one service for all three orders of deacons, priests and bishops&lt;/ref&gt; its Preface explicitly mentions the historic succession but it has been described as "... another case of Cranmer's opportunist adoption of medieval forms for new purposes."{{Sfn | MacCulloch | 1996 | p =}} In 1551, the episcopate was remodelled by the appointment of Protestants to the bench. This removed the refusal of some bishops to enforce the regulations as an obstacle to change.

Henceforth, the Reformation proceeded apace. In 1552, the prayer book—which the conservative Bishop [[Stephen Gardiner]] had approved from his prison cell as being "patient of a Catholic interpretation"—was replaced by a second, much more radical prayer book that altered the service to remove any sense that the Eucharist was a material sacrifice offered to God while keeping the belief that it was a sacrifice of thanksgiving and praise (in word). Edward's Parliament also repealed his father's Six Articles.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The enforcement of the new liturgy did not always take place without a struggle. Conformity was the order of the day, but in [[East Anglia]] and in [[Devon]] there were [[Prayer Book rebellion|rebellions]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''The Voices from Morebath'' Duffy (Yale 2001), p.&amp;nbsp;127f. The vicar of Morebath in Devon recorded the doings of the parish during the whole period, noting the compliant destruction of items previously paid for by sacrificial fundraising, and the singular resistance over the new prayer book. The parish paid for five men to join the rebellion at St. David's Down outside Exeter&lt;/ref&gt; as also in Cornwall, to which many parishes sent their young men; they were put down only after considerable loss of life. In other places the causes of the rebellions were less easy to pin down,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brigden|2000|p=185}} cites economic causes relating to enclosure legislation. MacCulloch calls the risings "baffling".&lt;/ref&gt; but by July throughout southern England, there was "quavering quiet," which burst out into "stirs" in many places, most significantly in [[Kett's Rebellion]] in [[Norwich]].

Apart from these more spectacular pieces of resistance, in some places chantry priests continued to say prayers and landowners to pay them to do so. Opposition to the removal of images was widespread—so much so that when during the Commonwealth, [[William Dowsing]] was commissioned to the task of image breaking in [[Suffolk]], his task, as he records it, was enormous.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Dixon, Andrew, p.&amp;nbsp;38&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kent]] and the southeast, compliance was mostly willing and for many, the sale of vestments and plate was an opportunity to make money (but it was also true that in London and Kent, Reformation ideas had permeated more deeply into popular thinking).

The effect of the resistance was to topple Somerset as Lord Protector, so that in 1549 it was feared by some that the Reformation would cease. The prayer book was the tipping point. But Lisle, now made Earl of Warwick, was made Lord President of the Privy Council and, ever the opportunist (he died a public Roman Catholic), he saw the further implementation of the reforming policy as a means of defeating his rivals.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 176}}

[[File:S95ReformationDestructionEly.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|Reformation-Vandalized statue in the Lady Chapel of [[Ely Cathedral]]]]

Outwardly, the destruction and removals for sale had changed the church forever. Many churches concealed their vestments and their silver,&lt;ref name= Duffy490&gt;{{harvnb| Duffy | 2005 | p = 490}}: Some of them were simply reclaimed by the gentry who had, in fact, lent them to the church; at Long Melford, Sir John Clopton, a patron of the church, bought up many of the images, probably to preserve them.&lt;/ref&gt; and had buried their stone altars. There were many disputes between the government and parishes over church property. Thus, when Edward died in July 1553 and the Duke of Northumberland attempted to have the Protestant [[Lady Jane Grey]] made Queen, the unpopularity of the confiscations gave Mary the opportunity to have herself proclaimed Queen, first in Suffolk, and then in London to the acclamation of the crowds.

==Marian Restoration==
[[File:Mary I of England.jpg|right|thumb|Queen Mary I of England restored the English allegiance to Rome.]]
From 1553, under the reign of Henry's Roman Catholic daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], the Reformation legislation was repealed and Mary sought to achieve the reunion with Rome. Her first Act of Parliament was to [[Ex post facto law|retroactively]] validate Henry's marriage to her mother and so legitimise her claim to the throne.

Achieving her objective was, however, not straightforward. Before reunion with Rome could occur, church property disputes had to be settled—which, in practice, meant letting those who had bought former church property keep it. Cardinal [[Reginald Pole]] arrived in November 1554 to become Archbishop of Canterbury in Cranmer's place. Mary could have had Cranmer, imprisoned as he was, tried and executed for treason—he had supported the claims of Lady Jane Grey—but she resolved to have him tried for [[heresy]]. His recantations of his Protestantism would have been a major coup. Unhappily for her, he unexpectedly withdrew his recantations at the last minute as he was to be burned at the stake, thus ruining her government's propaganda victory.{{Sfn|MacCulloch|2003|pp=281–282}}

If Mary was to secure England for Roman Catholicism, she needed an heir. On the advice of the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor]] she married his son, [[Philip II of Spain]]; she needed to prevent her Protestant half-sister Elizabeth from inheriting the Crown and thus returning England to Protestantism. There was opposition, and even a rebellion in Kent (led by [[Wyatt's Rebellion|Sir Thomas Wyatt]]); even though it was provided that Philip would never inherit the kingdom if there was no heir, received no estates and had no coronation.{{Sfn|MacCulloch|2003|p=281}} He was there to provide an heir. But she never became pregnant, and likely suffered from cancer. Ironically, another blow fell. Pope Julius died and his successor, [[Pope Paul IV]], declared war on Philip and recalled Pole to Rome to have him tried as a heretic. Mary refused to let him go. The support she might have expected from a grateful Pope was thus denied.{{Sfn|MacCulloch|2003|pp=284–285}} 

After 1555, the initial reconciling tone of the regime began to harden. The medieval heresy laws were restored. The [[Marian Persecutions]] of Protestants ensued and 283 Protestants were burnt at the stake for heresy. This resulted in the Queen becoming known as ''Bloody Mary'', due to the influence of [[John Foxe]], one of the [[Marian exiles|Protestants who fled]] Marian England. [[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Foxe's ''Book of Martyrs'']] recorded the executions in such detail that it became Mary's epitaph; [[Convocation of the English Clergy|Convocation]] subsequently ordered that Foxe's book should be placed in every cathedral in the land. In fact, while those who were executed after the revolts of 1536, and the St David's Down rebellion of 1549, and the unknown number of monks who died for refusing to submit, may not have been tried for heresy, they certainly exceeded that number by some amount. Even so, the heroism of some of the martyrs was an example to those who witnessed them, so that in some places it was the burnings that set people against the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Byford, "The Birth of a Protestant Town: the Process of Reformation in Tudor Colchester 1530–80", in ''The Reformation in English Towns 1500–1640'', ed. Collinson and Craig (Macmillan 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a slow consolidation in Roman Catholic strength in Mary's latter years. The reconciled Roman Catholic [[Edmund Bonner]], [[Bishop of London]], produced a catechism and a collection of homilies. Printing presses produced primers and other devotional materials, and recruitment to the English clergy began to rise after almost a decade. Repairs to long-neglected churches began. In the parishes "...restoration and repair continued, new bells were bought, and churches' ales produced their bucolic profits."{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 234}} Commissioners visited to ensure that altars were restored, roods rebuilt and vestments and plate purchased. Moreover, Pole was determined to do more than remake the past. He insisted on scripture, teaching and education, and on improving the clergy's moral standards.

It is difficult to determine how far previous reigns had broken Roman Catholic devotion, with its belief in the saints and in purgatory, but certainties—especially those that drew public financial support—had been shaken. [[Benefaction]]s to the church did not return significantly. Trust in clergy who had changed their minds and were now willing to leave their new wives—as they were required to do—was bound to have weakened.

Few monasteries, [[chantry|chantries]], and guilds were reinstated. "Parish religion was marked by religious and cultural sterility,"&lt;ref&gt;Dickens ''The English Reformation'' (1989 ed.) p.&amp;nbsp;309f&lt;/ref&gt; though some have observed enthusiasm, marred only by poor harvests that produced poverty and want.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 214}} Full restoration of the Roman Catholic faith in England to its pre-Reformation state would take time. Consequently, Protestants secretly ministering to underground congregations, such as [[Thomas Bentham]], were planning for a long haul, a ministry of survival.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 235}} Mary's death in November 1558, childless and without having made provision for a Roman Catholic to succeed her, would undo her consolidation.

==Elizabethan Settlement==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2018}}
{{Main|Elizabethan Religious Settlement}}
Following Mary's childless death, her half-sister [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] inherited the throne. One of the most important concerns during Elizabeth's early reign was [[Christianity|religion]]. Elizabeth could not be Roman Catholic, as that church considered her illegitimate. At the same time, she had observed the turmoil brought about by Edward's introduction of radical Protestant reforms. Communion with the Roman Catholic Church was again severed by Elizabeth. She relied primarily on her chief advisors, Sir William Cecil, as her Secretary of State, and [[Nicholas Bacon (courtier)|Sir Nicholas Bacon]], as the [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal]], for direction on the matter. Chiefly she supported her father's idea of reforming the church but made some minor adjustments. In this way, Elizabeth and her advisors aimed at a church that included most opinions.

Two groups were excluded. Roman Catholics who remained loyal to the Pope after he excommunicated the Queen in 1570 would not be tolerated. They were, in fact, regarded as traitors, because the Pope had refused to accept Elizabeth as Queen of England. Roman Catholics were given the hard choice of being loyal either to their church or their country. For some priests it meant life on the run, in some cases death for treason.

The other group not to be tolerated was people who wanted reform to go much further, and who finally gave up on the Church of England. They could no longer see it as a true church. They believed it had refused to obey the Bible, so they formed small groups of convinced believers outside the church. The government responded with imprisonment and exile to try to crush these "separatists".

The Church of England itself contained three groups. Those who believed the form of the church was just what it should be included leaders like John Jewel and Richard Hooker. A second group looked for opportunities to reintroduce some Roman Catholic practices. Under the Stuart kings they would have their chance. The third group, who came to be called ''Puritans'', wanted to remove remaining traces of the old ways. The Stuart kings were to give them a rough passage. At the end of Elizabeth's reign, the Church of England was firmly in place, but held the seeds of future conflict.
[[File:Darnley stage 3.jpg|thumb|left|Queen Elizabeth I of England reached a moderate religious settlement.]]
[[Parliament of England|Parliament]] was summoned in 1559 to consider the Reformation Bill and to create a new church. The Reformation Bill defined the [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|Communion]] as a [[Consubstantiation|consubstantial]] celebration as opposed to a [[transubstantiation|transubstantial]] celebration, included abuse of the pope in the [[litany]], and ordered that ministers (meaning ordained clergy) should not wear the [[surplice]] or other Roman Catholic vestments. It allowed the clergy – deacons, priests and bishops – to marry, banned images from churches, and confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the [[Church of England]].

The Bill met heavy resistance in the [[House of Lords]], as Roman Catholic bishops as well as the lay peers voted against it. They reworked much of the Bill, changed the litany to allow for a transubstantial belief in the Communion and refused to grant Elizabeth the title of Supreme Head of the Church. Parliament was [[prorogued]] over Easter, and when it resumed, the government entered two new bills into the Houses—the [[Act of Supremacy 1558|Act of Supremacy]] and the [[Act of Uniformity 1558|Act of Uniformity]].

===Act of Supremacy 1558===
[[Act of Supremacy 1558|This Act]] made null and void (with certain specific exceptions) the Marian act of 1554 that had repealed all Henry VIII's legislation from 1529 onwards, which had denied the authority of the See of Rome&lt;ref&gt;Bray, Gerald. ''Documents of the English Reformation'' James Clarke &amp; C° (1994) p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; and also confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Supreme Governor was a suitably equivocal title that made Elizabeth head of the Church without ever saying she was. This was important for two reasons: (1) it satisfied those who felt that a woman could not rule the church, and (2) it acted in a conciliatory way toward English Roman Catholics. For the clergy, Elizabeth's changes were more wholesale than those of her half-brother, Edward, had been. All but one ([[Anthony Kitchin]]) of the bishops lost their posts, a hundred fellows of Oxford colleges were deprived; many dignitaries resigned rather than take the oath. The bishops who were removed from the ecclesiastical bench were replaced by appointees who would agree to the reforms. Since the government was concerned that continuity of Orders continue without a break Mathew Parker was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury by two bishops who had been consecrated in the mid-1530s using the Pontifical and two with the English Ordinal of 1550.

On the question of images, Elizabeth's initial reaction was to allow crucifixes and candlesticks and the restoration of roods, but some of the new bishops whom she had elevated protested. In 1560 [[Edmund Grindal]], one of the Marian exiles now made [[Bishop of London]], was allowed to enforce the demolition of rood lofts in London and in 1561 the Queen herself ordered the demolition of all lofts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Haigh | 1993 | p = 244}}: She herself retained a cross and candlesticks in her own chapel.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the determination to prevent any further restoration was evidenced by the more thoroughgoing destruction of [[rood]]s, [[vestments]], stone altars, [[doom (painting)|dooms]], statues and other ornaments. The queen also appointed a new [[Privy Council]], removing many Roman Catholic counsellors by doing so. Under Elizabeth, factionalism in the Council and conflicts at court greatly diminished. The Act of Supremacy was passed without difficulty.

===Act of Uniformity 1558===
The [[Act of Uniformity 1558]], which forced people to attend Sunday service in a parish church with a new version of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], passed by only three votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Haigh | 1993 | pp = 237–241}}: No bishops voted in favour, two were prevented from voting at all and two other ecclesiastics were absent. The majority were all laymen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Guy ''Tudor England'' (OUP 1988) p.&amp;nbsp;262&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill of Uniformity was more cautious than the initial Reformation Bill. It revoked the harsh laws proposed against Roman Catholics, it removed the abuse of the pope from the litany and kept the wording that allowed for both consubstantial and transubstantial interpretations of the presence of Christ in the Eucharist without making any declaration about the matter (transubstantion is actually condemned in the Thirty-Nine Articles).

After Parliament was dismissed, Elizabeth and Cecil drafted the Royal Injunctions. These were additions to the settlement, and largely stressed continuity with the Catholic past – clergy were ordered to wear the surplice and the use of the cope was allowed in cathedrals and collegiate chapels – especially since all the clergy upon her accession the throne were Roman Catholic. Men were ordained to the three traditional orders of deacon, priest and bishop and so referred to in the Prayer Book Rites. The Ornaments Rubric states that the ornaments of the church and ministers thereof shall remain as they were in the second year of the reign of Edward VI, i.e. in 1548, when Mass was still celebrated (the Oxford Movement in the 19th century interpreted this as permission to wear chasubles, dalmatics and other vestments). Wafers, as opposed to ordinary baker's bread, were to be used as the bread at Communion. Communion would be taken kneeling. The Black Rubric denied the real and essential presence of Christ in the consecrated elements but allowed kneeling as long as this act did not imply adoration. The Queen had it removed. There had been opposition to the settlement in rural England, which for the most part was largely Roman Catholic, so the changes aimed for acceptance of the settlement. What succeeded more than anything else was the sheer length of Elizabeth's reign; while Mary had been able to impose her programme for a mere five years, Elizabeth had forty-five. Those who delayed, "looking for a new day" when restoration would again be commanded, were defeated by the passing of years.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 245}}

===Puritans and Roman Catholics===
{{Puritans}}
Elizabeth's reign saw the emergence of [[Puritan]]ism, which encompassed those Protestants who, whilst they agreed that there should be one national church, felt that the church had been but partially reformed. Puritanism ranged from hostility to the content of the Prayer Book and "popish" ceremony, to a desire that [[Ecclesiastical polity|church governance]] be radically reformed. Grindal was made [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1575 and chose to oppose even the Queen in his desire to forward the Puritan agenda. He ended a 6,000-word reproach to her with, "Bear with me, I beseech you Madam, if I choose rather to offend your earthly majesty than to offend the heavenly majesty of God."{{Sfn|MacCulloch|2003|p=384}} He was placed under house arrest for his trouble and though he was not deprived, his death in 1583 put an end to the hopes of his supporters.

Grindal's successor, [[John Whitgift|Archbishop Whitgift]], more reflected the Queen's determination to discipline those who were unprepared to accept her settlement. A conformist, he imposed a degree of obedience on the clergy that apparently alarmed even the Queen's ministers, such as Lord Burghley.{{Sfn|MacCulloch|2003|p=385}} The Puritan cause was not helped even by its friends. The pseudonymous "[[Martin Marprelate]]" tracts, which attacked conformist clergy with a libellous humorous tone, outraged senior Puritan clergy and set the government on an unsuccessful attempt to run the writer to earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacCulloch|2003|p=387}}: "John Cant" (Whitgift) was accused of sodomitical relations with the Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; The defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 incidentally made it more difficult for Puritans to resist the conclusion that since God "blew with his wind and they were scattered" he could not be too offended by the religious establishment in the land.{{Sfn|MacCulloch|2003|p=387}}

On the other side, there were still huge numbers of Roman Catholics. Some conformed, bending with the times, hoping that there would be a fresh reverse. Vestments were still hidden, golden candlesticks bequeathed, chalices kept. The Mass was still celebrated in some places{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 253}} alongside the new Communion service but was more difficult than before. Both Roman Catholic priests and laity lived a double life, apparently conforming, but avoiding taking the oath of conformity. Only as time passed did recusancy—refusal to attend Protestant services—became more common. Jesuits and seminary priests, trained in Douai and Rome to make good the losses of English priests, encouraged this.

By the 1570s, an underground church was growing fast as the Church of England became more Protestant and less bearable for Roman Catholics who were still a sizeable minority.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 267}} Only one public attempt to restore the old religion occurred: the [[Rising of the North|Rising of the Northern earls]] in 1569. It was a botched attempt; in spite of tumultuous crowds who greeted the rebels in [[Durham, England|Durham]], the rebellion did not spread. The assistance they sought did not materialise, their communication with allies at Court was poor. They came nowhere near to freeing [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]], whose presence might have rallied support, from her imprisonment in Tutbury.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt| Haigh | 1993 | p = 256}} argues that the initial impetus for the rebellion was scarcely religious at all, but political; what swelled support, however, was a rejection of the Prayer Book and a desire to restore the Mass.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church's refusal to countenance occasional attendance at Protestant services, as well as the excommunication of Elizabeth by [[Pope Pius V]] in 1570, presented the choice to Roman Catholics more starkly. The arrival of the seminary priests, while it was a lifeline to many Roman Catholics, brought further trouble. Elizabeth's ministers took steps to stem the tide: fines for refusal to attend church were raised from 12&amp;nbsp;d. per service to £20 a month, fifty times an artisan's wage; it was now treason to be absolved from schism and reconciled to Rome; the execution of priests began—the first in 1577, four in 1581, eleven in 1582, two in 1583, six in 1584, fifty-three by 1590, and seventy more between 1601 and 1608.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Haigh | 1993 | pp = 262f}}: "...England judicially murdered more Roman Catholics than any other country in Europe."&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|MacCulloch|2003|p=392}} It became treasonable for a Roman Catholic priest ordained abroad to enter the country. Because the papacy had called for the deposing of the Queen, the choice for moderate Roman Catholics lay between treason and damnation. The [[List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation]] was extensive.

There is some distance between legislation and its enforcement. The governmental attacks on [[recusancy]] were mostly upon the gentry. Few recusants were actually fined; the fines that were imposed were often at reduced rates; the persecution eased; priests came to recognise that they should not refuse communion to occasional conformists.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 264}} The persecutions did not extinguish the faith, but they tested it sorely. The huge number of Roman Catholics in [[East Anglia]] and the [[Northern England|North]] in the 1560s disappeared into the general population in part because recusant priests largely served the great Roman Catholic houses, which alone could hide them.{{Sfn| Haigh | 1993 | p = 265}} Without the Mass and pastoral care, yeomen, artisans and husbandmen fell into conformism. Roman Catholicism, supported by foreign or expatriate priests, came to be seen as treasonous.

==Legacy==
{{Main|English Civil War}}
By the time of Elizabeth's death a third party had emerged, "perfectly hostile" to Puritans but not adherent to Rome. It preferred the revised [[Book of Common Prayer]] of 1559, which was without some of the matters offensive to Roman Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Proctor F. and Frere W. H., ''A New History of the Book of Common Prayer'' (Macmillan 1965) p.&amp;nbsp;91f.&lt;/ref&gt; The recusants had been removed from the centre of the stage. The new dispute was now between the Puritans (who wished to see an end of the prayer book and episcopacy), and this third party (the considerable body of people who looked kindly on the Elizabethan Settlement, who rejected ''[[prophesyings]]'', whose spirituality had been nourished by the Prayer Book and who preferred the governance of bishops).&lt;ref&gt;Judith Maltby, ''Prayer Book and People in Elizabethan and Early Stuart England'' (Cambridge 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was between these two groups that, after Elizabeth's death in 1603, a new, more savage episode of the Reformation was in the process of gestation. During the reigns of the Stuart kings, [[James I of England|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], the battle lines were to become more defined, leading ultimately to the [[English Civil War]], the first on English soil to engulf parts of the civilian population. The war was only partly about religion, but the abolition of prayer book and episcopacy by a Puritan Parliament was an element in the causes of the conflict. As historian MacCulloch has noted, the legacy of these tumultuous events can be recognised, throughout the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] (1649–60) and [[the Restoration]] that followed it, and beyond. This third party was to become the core of the restored Church of England, but at the price for further division.

==Historiography==
{{Further|Historiography of the United Kingdom}}
The historiography of the English Reformation has seen vigorous clashes among dedicated protagonists and scholars for five centuries.  The main factual details at the national level have been clear since 1900, as laid out for example by [[James Anthony Froude]],&lt;ref&gt;Froude, ''History of England from the Fall of Wolsey to the Defeat of the Spanish Armada,'' (12 volumes, 1893) [https://archive.org/search.php?query=Froude%2C%20"Wolsey" online free]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Albert Pollard]].&lt;ref&gt;R.A.F. Pollard, ''Henry VIII'' (1905) [https://archive.org/details/henryviii00pollgoog online free]; Pollard, ''The History of England from the Accession of Edward VI to the Death of Elizabeth, 1547–1603'' (1910) [https://archive.org/details/historyofenglandfr00polluoft online free].&lt;/ref&gt;

Reformation historiography has seen many schools of interpretation with Protestant, Catholic, Anglican historians using their own religious perspectives.{{Sfn| Vidmar | 2005}} In addition there has been a highly influential [[Whig history|Whig]] interpretation, based on liberal secularized Protestantism, that depicted the Reformation in England, in the words of Ian Hazlitt, as "the midwife delivering England from the Dark Ages to the threshold of modernity, and so a turning point of progress".  Finally among the older schools was a neo-Marxist interpretation that stressed the economic decline of the old elites in the rise of the landed gentry and middle classes. All these approaches still have representatives, but the main thrust of scholarly historiography since the 1970s falls into four groupings or schools, according to Hazlett.&lt;ref&gt;W. Ian Hazlett, "Settlements: The British Isles" in Thomas A.  Brady, Jr.  et al. eds. ''Handbook of European History 1400–1600: Late Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Reformation'' (volume 2 1995) pp. 2:455–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey Elton]] leads the first faction with an agenda rooted in political historiography. It concentrates on the top of the early modern church-state looking at it at the mechanics of policymaking and the organs of its implementation and enforcement.  The key player for Elton was not Henry VIII, but rather his principal Secretary of State Thomas Cromwell.  Elton downplays the prophetic spirit of the religious reformers in the theology of keen conviction, dismissing them as the meddlesome intrusions from fanatics and bigots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Arthur J. |last=Slavin |title=G. R. Elton: On Reformation and Revolution |journal=The History Teacher |volume=23 |issue=4 |year=1990 |pages=405–431 |jstor=494396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Christopher |last=Haigh |title=Religion |journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society |volume=7 |year=1997 |pages=281–299 |jstor=3679281 |postscript=none}} deals with Elton.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, Geoffrey Dickens and others were motivated by a primarily religious perspective. They prioritize the religious and subjective side of the movement.  While recognizing the Reformation was imposed from the top, just as it was everywhere else in Europe, it also responded to aspirations from below.  Dickens has been criticized for underestimating the strength of residual and revived Roman Catholicism, but has been praised for his demonstration of the close ties to European influences. In the Dickens school, [[David Loades]] has stressed the theological importance of the Reformation for Anglo-British development.&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Dickens, John Tonkin, and Kenneth Powell, eds., ''The Reformation in historical thought'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

Revisionists comprise a third school, led by [[Christopher Haigh]], [[Jack Scarisbrick]] and numerous other scholars.  Their main achievement was the discovery of an entirely new corpus of primary sources at the local level, leading them to the emphasis on Reformation as it played out on a daily and local basis, with much less emphasis on the control from the top they emphasize turning away from elite sources they emphasize local parish records, diocesan files, guild records, data from boroughs, the courts, and especially telltale individual wills.

Finally, [[Patrick Collinson]] and others have brought much more precision to the theological landscape, with Calvinist Puritans who were impatient with the Anglican caution sent compromises.  Indeed, the Puritans were a distinct subgroup who did not comprise all of Calvinism.  The Church of England thus emerged as a coalition of factions, all of them Protestant inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Cust and Ann Hughes, eds., ''Conflict in early Stuart England: studies in religion and politics 1603–1642'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

All the recent schools have decentered Henry VIII, and minimized hagiography. They have paid more attention to localities, Catholicism, radicals, and theological niceties.  On Catholicism, the older schools overemphasized [[Thomas More]] (1470–1535), to the neglect of other bishops and factors inside Catholicism.  The older schools too often concentrated on elite London, the newer ones look to the English villages.{{Sfn| Duffy | 2006}}

'''Environmental migrants''' are people who are forced to leave their home region due to sudden or long-term changes to their local environment.  These are changes which compromise their well-being or secure livelihood. Such changes are held to include increased [[droughts]], [[desertification]], [[sea level rise]], and disruption of seasonal [[weather]] patterns (i.e. [[monsoon]]s[[Environmental migrant#cite note-Terminski.2C Bogumil 2011-1|&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]). Climate refugees may choose to flee to or migrate to another country, or they may migrate internally within their own country.[[Environmental migrant#cite note-Myers-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

The term "environmental migrant" is used somewhat interchangeably with a range of similar terms, such as '''ecological refugee''', '''environmental refugee''', '''climate refugee''', '''forced environmental migrant''', '''environmentally motivated migrant''', '''climate change refugee''', '''environmentally displaced person (EDP)''', '''disaster refugee''', '''environmental displacee''', '''eco-refugee''', '''ecologically displaced person''', or '''environmental-refugee-to-be (ERTB)'''.&lt;ref&gt;Boano, C., Zetter, R., and Morris, T., (2008). Environmentally Displaced People: Understanding the linkages between environmental change, livelihoods and forced migration, [[Refugee Studies Centre]] Policy Brief No.1 (RSC: Oxford), pg.4&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''climate exiles''' has been used to refer to those climate migrants who may be in danger of becoming [[Statelessness|stateless]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The distinctions between these terms are contested.

Despite problems in formulating a uniform and clear-cut definition of 'environmental migration', such a concept has increased as an issue of concern in the 2000s as [[policy]]-makers, environmental and social scientists attempt to conceptualize the potential societal [[Effects of global warming|effects of climate change]] and general [[environmental degradation]]. "Unless it is assumed" in order to consider a person a climate refugee, nature or the environment could be considered the persecutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berlin-institut.org/fileadmin/user_upload/handbuch_texte/pdf_Renaud_Environmental.pdf|title=Environmental Degradation and Migration|last=Renaud, Fabrice et. al|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705141123/http://www.berlin-institut.org/fileadmin/user_upload/handbuch_texte/pdf_Renaud_Environmental.pdf|archive-date=2016-07-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition and concept ==
Climate refugees do not really fit into any of the legal [[Refugee#Legal definition|definitions of a refugee]]. Not all climate refugees migrate from their home country, on occasion they are just displaced within their country of origin. Moreover, the refugees aren't leaving their homes because of fear they will be persecuted, or because of "generalized violence or events seriously disturbing public order."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/46f7c0ee2.pdf |page19&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the definition of who is a refugee was expanded since its first international and legally binding definition in [[1951 Refugee Convention|1951]] people who are forced to flee due to environmental change are still not offered the same legal protection as refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, Lindsey. ( 16 February 2012).  ''[http://www.stimson.org/spotlight/treading-water-climate-change-the-maldives-and-de-territorialization/ Treading Water: Climate Change, the Maldives, and De-territorialization]''. Stimson Centre.  Retrieved 25 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "environmental refugee" was first proposed by [[Lester Brown]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L., Mcgrath, P., and Stokes, B., (1976). twenty two dimensions of the population problem, Worldwatch Paper 5, Washington DC: [[Worldwatch Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM) proposes the following definition for environmental migrants:&lt;ref name="iom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iom.int/jahia/webdav/shared/shared/mainsite/about_iom/en/council/94/MC_INF_288.pdf|title=DISCUSSION NOTE: MIGRATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Environmental migrants are persons or groups of persons who, for compelling reasons of sudden or progressive changes in the environment that adversely affect their lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move either within their country or abroad."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Climate refugees or climate migrants are a subset of environmental migrants who were forced to flee "due to sudden or gradual alterations in the [[natural environment]] related to at least one of three impacts of [[climate change]]: [[sea-level rise]], [[extreme weather]] events, and [[drought]] and [[water scarcity]]."&lt;ref&gt;Global Governance Project. (2012). [http://www.glogov.org/?pageid=80 Forum on Climate Refugees]. Retrieved on 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The [[International Organisation for Migration]] proposes three types of environmental migrants:
*''Environmental emergency migrants'': people who flee temporarily due to an environmental disaster or sudden environmental event. (Examples: someone forced to leave due to a hurricane, tsunami, earthquake, etc.)
*''Environmental forced migrants'': people who have to leave due to deteriorating environmental conditions. (Example: someone forced to leave due to a slow deterioration of their environment such as [[deforestation]], coastal deterioration, etc.)
*''Environmental motivated migrants'' also known as ''environmentally induced economic migrants'': people who choose to leave to avoid possible future problems. (Example: someone who leaves due to declining crop productivity caused by desertification)

&lt;blockquote&gt;“those displaced temporarily due to local disruption such as an avalanche or earthquake; those who migrate because environmental degradation has undermined their livelihood or poses unacceptable risks to health; and those who resettle because [[land degradation]] has resulted in desertification or because of other permanent and untenable changes in their habitat.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berlin-institut.org/fileadmin/user_upload/handbuch_texte/pdf_Renaud_Environmental.pdf|title=Environmental Degradation and Migration|last=Renaud, Fabrice et. al.|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705141123/http://www.berlin-institut.org/fileadmin/user_upload/handbuch_texte/pdf_Renaud_Environmental.pdf|archive-date=2016-07-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This type of migrant is displaced from their home state when their environment rapidly changes. They are displaced when disastrous events occur, such as tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, and other natural disasters occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://climatemigration.org.uk/understanding-a-slow-disaster-getting-to-grips-with-slow-onset-disasters-and-what-they-mean-for-migration-and-displacement/|title=Understanding a slow disaster: getting to grips with slow-onset disasters, and what they mean for migration and displacement -|date=4 February 2015|access-date=26 February 2017|language=en-US|newspaper=Climate &amp; Migration Coalition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enumeration ==

=== Global statistics ===
There have been a number of attempts over the decades to enumerate environmental migrants and refugees. Jodi Jacobson (1988) is cited as the first researcher to enumerate the issue, stating that there were already up to 10 million ‘Environmental Refugees’. Drawing on ‘worst-case scenarios’ about sea-level rise, she argued that all forms of ‘Environmental Refugees’ would be six times as numerous as political refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, J.L. (1988). Environmental Refugees: a Yardstick of Habitability, Worldwatch paper 86, Worldwatch Institute, Washington DC, page 38&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1989, [[Mostafa Kamal Tolba|Mustafa Tolba]], Executive Director of UNEP, was claiming that 'as many as 50 million people could become environmental refugees' if the world did not act to support sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mostafa Kamal Tolba|Tolba, M. K.]] (1989). Our biological heritage under siege. Bioscience 39, 725–728, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC 1990: 20) declared that the greatest single consequence of climate change could be migration, ‘with millions of people displaced by shoreline erosion, coastal flooding and severe drought’.&lt;ref&gt;Warner K and Laczko F. (2008). ‘Migration, Environment and Development: New Directions for Research’, in Chamie J, Dall’Oglio L (eds.), International Migration and Development, Continuing the Dialogue: Legal and Policy Perspectives, IOM, page 235&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1990s, British environmentalist, [[Norman Myers]], became the most prominent proponent of this ‘maximalist’ school (Suhrke 1993). Noting, that "environmental refugees will soon become the largest group of involuntary refugees".&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;Myers, Norman. "Environmental Refugees: A Growing Phenomenon ." Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences 357.1420 (2002): 609. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he stated that there were 25 million environmental refugees in the mid-1990s, further claiming that this figure could double by 2010, with an upper limit of 200 million by 2050 (Myers 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N. (1997). ‘Environmental Refugees’, Population and Environment 19(2): 167–82&lt;/ref&gt; Myers argued that the causes of environmental displacement would include desertification, lack of water, salination of irrigated lands and the depletion of biodiversity. He also hypothesised that displacement would amount to 30m in China, 30m in India, 15m in Bangladesh, 14m in Egypt, 10m in other delta areas and coastal zones, 1m in island states, and with otherwise agriculturally displaced people totalling 50m by 2050.&lt;ref name="Myers, N 1995"&gt;Myers, N. and Kent, J. (1995). Environmental Exodus: an Emergent Crisis in the Global Arena, (Climate Institute{{Who|date=December 2011}}: Washington DC)&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Myers has suggested that the figure by 2050 might be as high as 250 million.&lt;ref name="Christian Aid 2007"&gt;Christian Aid (2007). ‘Human Tide: The Real Migration Crisis’ (CA: London), page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Natural disasters caused by climate change.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|A map showing where natural disasters caused/aggravated by [[global warming]] may occur, and thus where environmental refugees would be created{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}]]
These claims have gained significant currency, with the most common projection being that the world will have 150–200 million climate change refugees by 2050. Variations of this claim have been made in influential reports on climate change by the IPCC (Brown 2008: 11)&lt;ref name="iom.int"&gt;Brown, O (2008). ‘Migration and Climate Change’, [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] Migration Research Series, paper no.31, www.iom.int&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change (Stern et al. 2006: 3),&lt;ref&gt;Stern, N. (Ed.) (2006). The Economics of Climate Change: The Stern Review, [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by NGOs such as Friends of the Earth,&lt;ref&gt;[[Friends of the Earth]], ‘A Citizen's Guide to Climate Refugees, Fact Sheet Four: Predictions of Climate Refugees to 2050’ (FOTE: London), 2007: 10&lt;/ref&gt;  Greenpeace Germany (Jakobeit and Methmann 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Jakobeit, C., and Methmann, C. (2007). Klimafluchtlinge – Die Verleugnete Katastrophe, Greenpeace, Hamburg&lt;/ref&gt; and Christian Aid;&lt;ref name="Christian Aid 2007"/&gt;  and inter-governmental organisations such as the Council of Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Assembly Doc. 11084, 23 October 2006, The Problem of Environmental Refugees: 1&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO,&lt;ref&gt;[http://publishing.unesco.org/details.aspx?Code_Livre=4839 UNESCO (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; IOM (Brown 2008) and UNHCR.&lt;ref&gt;UNHCR (2002), ‘A critical time for the environment’, Refugees No.127. Geneva.&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman Myers is the most cited researcher in this field, who found that 25 million environmental migrants existed in 1995 in his work (Myers &amp; Kent 1995),&lt;ref name="Myers, N 1995"/&gt; which drew upon over 1000 sources.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of the Earth, A Citizen's Guide to Climate Refugees, Fact Sheet Four: Predictions of Climate Refugees to 2050&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Vikram Kolmannskog]] has stated that Myers’ work can be ‘criticized for being inconsistent, impossible to check and failing to take proper account of opportunities to adapt’ (2008: 9).&lt;ref&gt;Kolmannskog, V (2008). Future Floods of Refugees, ([[Norwegian Refugee Council]]: Oslo)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Myers himself has acknowledged that his figures are based upon ‘heroic extrapolation’ (Brown 2008: 12).&lt;ref name="iom.int"/&gt; More generally, Black has argued that there is ‘surprisingly little scientific evidence’ that indicates that the world is ‘filling-up with environmental refugees’ (1998: 23).&lt;ref&gt;Black, R. (1998). Refugees, Environment and Development, Harlow: Longman&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Francois Gemenne has stated that: 'When it comes to predictions, figures are usually based on the number of people living in regions at risk, and not on the number of people actually expected to migrate. Estimates do not account for adaptation strategies [or] different levels of vulnerability' (Gemenne 2009: 159).&lt;ref&gt;Gemenne, F (2009). ‘Environmental Migration: Normative Frameworks and Policy Prescriptions’, Doctoral Thesis, Sciences-Po, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia and the Pacific ===

According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, more than 42 million people were displaced in Asia and the Pacific during 2010 and 2011, more than twice the population of Sri Lanka. This figure includes those displaced by storms, floods, and heat and cold waves. Still others were displaced by drought and sea-level rise. Most of those compelled to leave their homes eventually returned when conditions improved, but an undetermined number became migrants, usually within their country, but also across national borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) – Norwegian Refugee Council |url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CFA06/(httpPublications)/D558B66C3B055DE0C12578A7002C0FE1?OpenDocument |title=Displacement due to natural hazard-induced disasters: Global estimates for 2009 and 2010 |publisher=Internal-displacement.org |date= |accessdate=23 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301165512/http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CFA06/(httpPublications)/D558B66C3B055DE0C12578A7002C0FE1?OpenDocument |archivedate=1 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate-induced migration is a highly complex issue which needs to be understood as part of global migration dynamics. Migration typically has multiple causes, and environmental factors are intertwined with other social and economic factors, which themselves can be influenced by environmental changes. Environmental migration should not be treated solely as a discrete category, set apart from other migration flows. A 2012 Asian Development Bank study argues that climate-induced migration should be addressed as part of a country's development agenda, given the major implications of migration on economic and social development. The report recommends interventions both to address the situation of those who have migrated, as well as those who remain in areas subject to environmental risk. It says: "To reduce migration compelled by worsening environmental conditions, and to strengthen the resilience of at-risk communities, governments should adopt policies and commit financing to social protection, livelihoods development, basic urban infrastructure development, and disaster risk management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beta.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2012/addressing-climate-change-migration.pdf |title=Addressing Climate Change Migration in Asia &amp; the Pacific 2012 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=23 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406002645/http://beta.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2012/addressing-climate-change-migration.pdf |archivedate=6 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it is maintained that the poor populate areas that are most at risk for environmental destruction and climate change, including coastlines, flood-lines, and steep slopes. As a result, climate change threatens areas already suffering from extreme poverty. "The issue of equity is crucial. Climate affects us all, but does not affect us all equally," UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told delegates at a climate conference in Indonesia.&lt;ref name="World Vision"&gt;[http://www.worldvision.ca/ContentArchives/content-stories/Pages/EnvironmentalRefugees "Environmental Refugees."] World Vision Canada. N.p., n.d. Web. 15 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Africa is also one of the world regions where environmental displacement is critical largely due to droughts and other climate-related eventualities.&lt;ref&gt;Adamo, S.;  de Sherbinin, A.

In [[Minqin]] county, [[Gansu Province]], "10,000 people have left the area and have become ''shengtai yimin'', 'ecological migrants'".&lt;ref name="Water Scarcity in China"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7d6f69ea-bc73-11e2-b344-00144feab7de.html#axzz2TMae0Kjs | title=China: High and dry: Water shortages put a brake on economic growth | publisher=Financial Times | date=14 May 2013 | accessdate=15 May 2013 | author=Hook, Leslie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a claim of a [[Kiribati]] man of being a "climate change refugee" under the [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] (1951) was determined by the New Zealand High Court to be untenable.&lt;ref name="THC1"&gt;{{cite web| work= NZLII |title= Teitiota v Chief Executive of the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment [2013] NZHC 3125 (26 November 2013)|url= http://www.nzlii.org/nz/cases/NZHC/2013/3125.html| accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.vernonrive.co.nz/PointSource/Climate_refugees_revisited_a_closer_look_at_the_Tuvalu_deci.aspx | title= "Climate refugees" revisited: a closer look at the Tuvalu decision | publisher= Point Source | date= 14 August 2014 | quote=  | author= Vernon Rive | accessdate= 11 February 2015 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150211073607/http://www.vernonrive.co.nz/PointSource/Climate_refugees_revisited_a_closer_look_at_the_Tuvalu_deci.aspx | archivedate= 11 February 2015 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Refugee Convention did not apply as there is no persecution or serious harm related to any of the five stipulated convention grounds. The Court rejected the argument that the international community itself (or countries which can be said to have been historically high emitters of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases) were the “persecutor” for the purposes of the Refugee Convention.&lt;ref name="THC1"/&gt;
This analysis of the need for the person to identify persecution of the type described in the Refugee Convention does not exclude the possibility that a people for countries experiencing severe impacts of climate change can come with the Refugee Convention. However, it is not the climate change event itself, rather the social and political response to climate change, which is likely to create the pathway for a successful claim. The New Zealand Immigration and Protection Tribunal and the High Court, “there is a complex inter-relationship between natural disasters, environmental degradation and human vulnerability. Sometimes a tenable pathway to international protection under the Refugee Convention can result. Environmental issues sometimes lead to armed conflict. There may be ensuing violence towards or direct repression of an entire section of a population.

In 2014 attention was drawn to an appeal to the [[New Zealand]] Immigration and Protection Tribunal against the deportation of a Tuvaluan family on the basis that they were "climate change refugees", who would suffer hardship resulting from the environmental degradation of [[Tuvalu]].&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite web| last = Rick| first = Noack | title= Has the era of the ‘climate change refugee’ begun?| work=Washington Post |date=7 August 2014|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/08/07/has-the-era-of-the-climate-change-refugee-begun/|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the subsequent grant of residence permits to the family was made on grounds unrelated to the refugee claim.&lt;ref name=PS&gt;{{cite web | last= Rive | first= Vernon | title= "Climate refugees" revisited: a closer look at the Tuvalu decision | publisher= Point Source | date= 14 August 2014 | url= http://www.vernonrive.co.nz/PointSource/Climate_refugees_revisited_a_closer_look_at_the_Tuvalu_deci.aspx | accessdate= 11 February 2015 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150211073607/http://www.vernonrive.co.nz/PointSource/Climate_refugees_revisited_a_closer_look_at_the_Tuvalu_deci.aspx | archivedate= 11 February 2015 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family was successful in their appeal because, under the relevant immigration legislation, there were "exceptional circumstances of a humanitarian nature" that justified the grant of resident permits as the family was integrated into New Zealand society with a sizeable extended family which had effectively relocated to New Zealand.&lt;ref name=PS/&gt;

==== Alaska ====
There have been 178 Alaskan communities threatened by erosion of their land. The annual temperature has steadily increased over the last fifty years, with Alaska seeing it double (compared to the rate seen across the rest of the United States) to the rate of 3.4 degrees, with an alarming 6.3 degrees increase for the winters over the past fifty years. Many of the communities residing in these areas have been living off the land for generations. There is an eminent threat of loss of culture and loss of tribal identity with these communities.&lt;ref&gt;BARTH, BRIAN. "Before It's Too Late." ''Planning'' 82.8 (2016): 14–20. ''Academic Search Complete''. Web. 21 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[Army Corps of Engineers]] identified four Alaskan villages which need to relocate due to the risk of flooding and erosion. More villages were added to this list between 2003 and 2016. One of the villages, [[Shishmaref, Alaska|Shishmaref]], has 650 people who are at risk of becoming the first American community climate refugees. However, relocation is proving difficult because there is no governmental institutional framework that exists for the aid of climate refugees in the United States. The Obama administration promised to fund $50.4 billion to help with relocation efforts in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mintpressnews.com/alaskan-villagers-may-become-first-climate-change-refugees-town-swallowed-rising-sea/219576/|title=Alaskan Villagers May Become First ‘Climate Change Refugees’ As Town Swallowed By Rising Sea|last=Dreams|first=Lauren McCauley {{!}} Common|date=2016-08-18|work=MintPress News|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Louisiana ====
[[Isle de Jean Charles, Louisiana]], home to the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw First Nation, is being depopulated with federal grant money, due to saltwater intrusion and sea level rise.  This Indigenous Nation residing on the Isle de Jean Charles is facing the effects of climate change. The resettlement of this community of around 100, exists as the first migration of a total community in the state of Louisiana. This state has lost almost 2000 square miles of its coast within the last 87 years and now an alarming rate of almost 16 square miles a year is disappearing. In early 2016, a 48-million-dollar grant was the first allocation of federal tax dollars to aid a community suffering from direct impact of climate change. Louisiana has lost land mass comparable to the size of the state of Delaware revealing land mass loss that is at a rate faster than many places in the world. The resettlement plan for the Isle de Jean Charles is at the forefront of responding to climate change without destroying the community that resides within.&lt;ref&gt;Guillot, Craig.

=== South America ===
{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}

Many peer-reviewed articles analyzing migration in South America have found multiple types of linkages between climate change and its effect on migration.The effects and results vary based on the type of climatic change, socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics of migrants and the distance and direction of the migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Clark|last2=Bilsborrow|first2=Richard|date=2013-08-01|title=Environmental Influences on Human Migration in Rural Ecuador|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13524-012-0192-y|journal=Demography|language=en|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1217–1241|doi=10.1007/s13524-012-0192-y|issn=0070-3370|pmc=3661740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most climate migration studies are done in the developed world, scientists have called for more quantitative research within the developing world, including South America.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thiede|first=Brian|last2=Gray|first2=Clark|last3=Mueller|first3=Valerie|title=Climate variability and inter-provincial migration in South America, 1970–2011|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959378016303909|journal=Global Environmental Change|volume=41|pages=228–240|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2016.10.005|pmid=28413264|pmc=5389124|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migration in South America does not always increase as a result of increased environmental threats but is affected by factors such as climate variability and land suitability. These migrations happen either gradually or suddenly but are typically directed from rural to urban areas.  Inter-provincial migration is shown to not be as heavily influenced by environmental changes whereas migration outside of the home country is heavily influenced by environmental changes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The results of a climactic event catalyzing migration change depending on the onset of the event, however, climate change related events such as drought and hurricanes augment or increase youth migration. Youth are more likely to migrate as a response to climate-related events. As a result, children who have been displaced are found to travel shorter distances to find work in rural destinations versus further to an urban area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baez|first=Javier|last2=Caruso|first2=German|last3=Mueller|first3=Valerie|last4=Niu|first4=Chiyu|date=2017-02-01|title=Droughts augment youth migration in Northern Latin America and the Caribbean|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-016-1863-2|journal=Climatic Change|language=en|volume=140|issue=3–4|pages=423–435|doi=10.1007/s10584-016-1863-2|issn=0165-0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers suggest a review of the terms that define who is an environmental migrant since policy-making bodies and intergovernmental agencies most affect responses when an environmental event causes people to migrate. Because of the increase in interest in this topic in the past decade some people call for a measure called preventive resettlement. The cases in which preventive resettlement appear appropriate is typically discerned by local and governmental bodies. Others call for an increase in social programs to both prevent and help in a migration event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1690464881?accountid=12725|title=Climate-Induced Resettlement: Environmental Change and the Planned Relocation of Communities|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and legal perspectives==
{{See also|Adaptation to global warming}}
The [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM) expects the scale of global migration to rise as a result of accelerated climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iom.int/jahia/Jahia/activities/by-theme/migration-climate-change-environmental-degradation/cache/offonce;jsessionid=6D506CB9A6A2EBACAD3BA42BFFC8D346.worker02 International Organization for Migration's Perspective on Migration and Climate Change] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090808223542/http://www.iom.int/jahia/Jahia/activities/by-theme/migration-climate-change-environmental-degradation/cache/offonce;jsessionid=E438C13570779EEF244FD50EF6862717.worker02 |date=8 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It, therefore, recommends policymakers around the world to take a proactive stance on the matter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;International Organization for Migration: [http://www.iom.int/jahia/Jahia/policy Key Principles for Policy Making on Migration, Climate Change &amp; the Environmental Degradation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310183200/http://www.iom.int/jahia/Jahia/policy |date=10 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IOM is composed of 146 member states and 13 observer states and "works closely with governments in promoting migration management that ensures humane and orderly migration that is beneficial to migrants and societies."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Additionally, When interviewing Oliver- Smith, an anthropologist and member of the UN group, [[National Geographic Magazine]] noted that "there are at least 20 million environmental refugees worldwide, the [UN] group says – more than those displaced by war and political repression combined." Therefore, it is imperative that we begin to recognize this recent division of refugee.&lt;ref name="Lovgren"&gt;Lovgren, Stefan. "Climate Change Creating Millions of "Eco Refugees," UN Warns." Daily Nature and Science News and Headlines | National Geographic News. N.p., 18 October 2005. Web. 13 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Environmental Justice Foundation]] (EJF) has argued that the people who will be forced to move due to climate change currently have no adequate recognition in international law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page590.html "No place like home – climate refugees"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107061956/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page590.html |date=7 November 2009 }}, The Environmental Justice Foundation, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The EJF contends that a new multilateral legal instrument is required to specifically address the needs of "climate refugees" in order to confer protection to those fleeing environmental degradation and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/03/global-warming-climate-refugees "Global warming could create 150 million climate refugees by 2050"] John Vidal, The Guardian, 3 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; They have also asserted that additional funding is needed to enable developing countries to adapt to climate change. [[Sujatha Byravan]] and Sudhir Chella Rajan have argued for the use of the  term 'climate exiles' and for international agreements to provide them political and legal rights, including citizenship in other countries, bearing in mind those countries' responsibilities and capabilities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E0DE1230F93AA35756C0A9639C8B63 "Before the Flood"] Sujatha Byravan and Sudhir Chella Rajan, [[The New York Times]], 9 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://epw.in/epw/uploads/articles/14119.pdf "Warming up to Immigrants: An Option for US Climate Policy"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Sujatha Byravan and Sudhir Chella Rajan, Economic and Political Weekly, 7 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/resources/journal/24_3/features/001.html "The Ethical Implications of Sea-Level Rise Due to Climate Change"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813155135/http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/resources/journal/24_3/features/001.html |date=13 August 2011 }} Sujatha Byravan and Sudhir Chella Rajan, Ethics &amp; International Affairs, Volume 24.3 (Fall 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, climate change may lead to conflict arising between countries that as a result of flooding or other conditions produce a large number of refugees, and bordering countries that build fences to keep out these refugees. The [[Bangladesh–India border]] is largely separated via a fence, and case studies suggest the possibility of violent conflict arising due to people fleeing from areas suffering from the destruction of [[arable land]]. Current migration has already resulted in low-scale conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Litchfield|first=William Alex|title=Climate Change Induced Extreme Weather Events &amp; Sea Level Rise in Bangladesh leading to Migration and Conflict|url=http://www1.american.edu/ted/ice/Bangladesh.html|work=[[American University]]|publisher=ICE Case Studies|accessdate=19 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720133948/http://www1.american.edu/ted/ice/Bangladesh.html|archivedate=20 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that sea levels will increase with up to 0.6 meters by 2100. This will cause populations to wipe out entirely. Small areas may have nothing left. This could lead to the loss of millions of refugees. Refugee organizations have taken on cases of many different refugees. The Organization for Refugees Asylum and Migration (ORAM) is designed to help refugees in seeking status and resettlement. They are designed to help refugees overcome the Refugee process. ORAM’s main goal is to protect the vulnerable refugees for the laws put on refugee and help end the refugee asylum process. There is a ton of legal action taken against refugees. Political laws are put on the refugees to either harm or hurt the refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/climate-refugee/|title=climate refugee|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-06-17|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global perceptions from possible countries of asylum ===
Reaction as for the possible acceptance of possible environmental migrants is mixed, this is because of countries dealing with other domestic problems. For example, India, which has a population of over 1 billion people, is building an [[Indo-Bangladeshi barrier|India-Bangladesh barrier]]. While the stated purpose of the barrier is to deter drug trade, the barrier may also help prevent the possible refuge of 20 million Bangladeshis who may be displaced by future climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/30/rich-west-climate-change|title=UK should open borders to climate refugees, says Bangladeshi minister|last=Grant|first=Harriet|date=4 December 2009|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=|work=|last2=Randerson|first2=James|last3=Vidal|first3=John|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a contrast to Canada in which public pressure is slowly building to create policies that will allow accommodation and better planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Sheila|year=2010|title=Environmental Migrants and Canada's Refugee Policy|url=|journal=Refuge: Canada's Periodical on Refugees|volume=27|pages=|via=Academic ONEfile}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/immigration/2014/11/05/ottawa_urged_to_open_doors_to_climate_migrants.html|title=Ottawa urged to open doors to ‘climate migrants’ {{!}} Toronto Star|last=Keung|first=Nicholas|date=|website=thestar.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalobserver.com/2015/10/30/exodus-climate-refugees-has-just-begun-where-will-they-go|title=Mass migration crisis likely to get much worse|last=Dinshaw|first=Fram|date=30 October 2015|website=National Observer|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/immigration/2016/03/11/environmental-migrants-breathing-easier-in-canada.html|title=Environmental migrants breathing easier in Canada {{!}} Toronto Star|website=thestar.com|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September 2016, [[Justin Trudeau|Prime Minister Trudeau]] of Canada told the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants that plans just for resettlement would not be enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalobserver.com/2016/09/20/opinion/climate-refugees-we-don%E2%80%99t-have-plan|title=Climate refugees?

Asylum is the freedom of prosecution in the country the people want to be in. Different countries have their own rules and laws of asylum. The United States, for example, has a system recognized by federal and international laws. France was the first country to constitute the right to asylum. So the right to asylum differs in different nations. There is a still fight for the right to asylum in some areas of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unric.org/en/latest-un-buzz/28883-the-invisible-climate-refugees|title=The invisible climate refugees|work=United Nations Regional Information Centre for Western Europe (UNRIC)|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perspective of countries taking immigrants ===
In the UK, research is being done on how climate change’s impact on countries that are emigrated to will vary due to the infrastructure of those countries. They want to put into place policies so that those who have to migrate could go throughout Europe, and have solid emergency planning in place so that the people being displaced would have a swift and quick plan of escape once their environment can no longer handle inhabitants-slow or sudden onset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perkiss|first=Stephanie|year=2010|title=Environmental Refugees: An Accountability Perspective|url=|journal=University of Wollongong|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end goal of this work is to determine the best course of action in the event of various environmental catastrophes.

==Popular culture==

[[File:World Climate Refugee Camp in Hannover.jpg|200px|right|thumb|German artist [[Hermann Josef Hack]]'s ''World Climate Refugee Camp'' in Hannover displaying 600 small climate refugee tents.]] The notion of 'environmental migrant', and particularly 'climate refugee', has gained traction in popular culture. A documentary entitled ''Climate Refugees'' has been released. "Climate Refugees" is an Official Selection for the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sundance.bside.com/2010/films/climaterefugees_sundance2010 Climate Refugees at Sundance Film Festival 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328014331/http://sundance.bside.com/2010/films/climaterefugees_sundance2010 |date=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Short Documentary Academy Award Nominee, [[Sun Come Up (film)|Sun Come Up]] (2011), tells the story of Carteret islanders who are forced to leave their ancestral land in response to climate change and migrate to war-torn Bougainville &lt;ref name="Sun Come Up"&gt;"[http://www.suncomeup.com/film/Home Sun Come Up: Home]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}."

[[File:Forum_for_Peace_and_Reconciliation_logo.png|thumb|Stylised design combining a [[dove of peace]] and a hand extended for a [[handshake]] of reconciliation]]
The '''Forum for Peace and Reconciliation''' ({{lang-ga|an Fóram um Shíocháin agus Athmhuintearas}}&lt;ref name=tearma&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tearma.ie/Search.aspx?term=an+F%C3%B3ram+um+Sh%C3%ADoch%C3%A1in+agus+Athmhuintearas | title = an Fóram um Shíocháin agus Athmhuintearas | work = téarma.ie – Dictionary of Irish Terms | publisher = [[Foras na Gaeilge]] and [[Dublin City University]] | accessdate = 20 Nov 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a forum established by the [[government of Ireland]] in October 1994 as part of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]].&lt;ref name="Gillespie2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillespie|first=Gordon|title=The A to Z of the Northern Ireland Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-4dFuaeAlvkC&amp;pg=PA110|accessdate=4 February 2012|date=2009-09-30|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6882-3|pages=110–111|chapter=Forum for Peace and Reconciliation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initiation==
The Forum was envisaged in paragraph 11 of the [[Downing Street Declaration]] of December 1993:&lt;ref name="background"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fusio.ie/web1/forum/background.html|title=Background to the Forum|year=1996|publisher=Forum for Peace and Reconciliation|accessdate=7 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990223194325/http://www.fusio.ie/web1/forum/background.html|archivedate=23 February 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dsd"&gt;[http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=8734 Joint Declaration 1993 (Downing St. Declaration)] [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs]], Ireland&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Irish Government would make their own arrangements within their jurisdiction to enable democratic parties to consult together and share in dialogue about the political future. The Taoiseach's intention is that these arrangements could include the establishment, in consultation with other parties, of a Forum for Peace and Reconciliation to make recommendations on ways in which agreement and trust between both traditions in Ireland can be promoted and established.

Preparations for the forum were triggered by the ceasefires announced in September 1994 by the [[Irish republicanism|republican]] [[Provisional IRA]] and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] [[Ulster Volunteer Force|UVF]] and [[Ulster Defence Association|UDA]], whose associated political parties were thus invited to the forum.&lt;ref name="background"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1994/10/12/00006.asp Dáil 12 Oct 1994 p.6]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sinn Féin]] accepted, while the loyalist [[Progressive Unionist Party|PUP]] and [[Ulster Democratic Party|UDP]] rejected, as did the mainstream [[Ulster unionist|unionist]] [[Ulster Unionist Party|UUP]] and [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]]. The presence of Sinn Féin alongside constitutional nationalist and centrist parties was considered a significant "confidence building measure";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/ira-ceasefire-reynolds-says-statement-means-no-going-back-the-view-from-dublin-1445926.html|title=IRA Ceasefire: Reynolds says statement means 'no going back': The view from Dublin|last=Murdoch|first=Alan|date=1 September 1994|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/2505319.stm|title=Another case of talks fatigue?|last=Devenport|first=Mark|date=22 November 2002|work=[[BBC Online]]|quote=Last time the Forum met its purpose was to welcome Sinn Féin into the ranks of democratic politics.|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; substantive negotiations involving the unionist parties and the British government would not begin till the following year. The British ambassador was invited to the opening of the forum, but there was no other British involvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1994/dec/01/forum-for-peace-and-reconciliation HC Deb 1 December 1994 vol 250 cc1315-6]&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[terms of reference]] were:&lt;ref name="tr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fusio.ie/web1/forum/reference.html|title=Terms of Reference|publisher=Forum for Peace and Reconciliation|accessdate=5 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991002163451/http://www.fusio.ie/web1/forum/reference.html|archivedate=2 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is being established by the Government in accordance with their intentions as expressed in the Joint Declaration, for as long as is necessary, to consult on and examine ways in which lasting peace, stability and reconciliation can be established by agreement among all the people of Ireland, and on the steps required to remove barriers of distrust, on the basis of promoting respect for the equal rights and validity of both traditions and identities. It will also explore ways in which new approaches can be developed to serve economic interests common to both parts of Ireland, including in the framework of [[European Union]]. It will be a fundamental guiding principle of the Forum and of participation in it that all differences relating to the exercise of the right of self-determination of the people of Ireland, and to all other matters, will be resolved exclusively by peaceful and democratic means. The purposes of the Forum will be to provide, as far as possible, an opportunity to both major traditions as well as to others, to assist in identifying and clarifying issues which could most contribute to creating a new era of trust and co-operation on the island. Participation in the Forum will be entirely without prejudice to the position on constitutional issues held by any Party.

==Regular sessions==
The forum's structure was modelled on the [[New Ireland Forum]] of 1983–84.  It was chaired by [[Catherine McGuinness]], then a judge of the [[Circuit Court (Ireland)|Circuit Court]], and had a secretariat with six members.&lt;ref name="members"/&gt;
. McGuinness' Protestant background was hoped to encourage unionist engagement with the forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/03/world/presbyterians-in-peace-forum-tell-their-fears-of-dublin.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm|title=Presbyterians, in Peace Forum, Tell Their Fears of Dublin|last=Clarity|first=James F.|date=3 April 1995|work=The New York Times|page=7|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It first met in [[Saint Patrick's Hall]] in [[Dublin Castle]] on 28 October 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1994/10/26/00010.asp Dáil 26 Oct 1994 p.10]&lt;/ref&gt; It had 41 plenary sessions and commissioned several reports, and subcommittees began drafting responses to the reports.&lt;ref name="pr2002"/&gt;  After the publication of the [[Joint Framework Document]] in February 1995, this became the focus of much of the Forum's deliberations.&lt;ref name="background" /&gt;

The forum was drafting a final report "Paths to a Political Settlement: Realities, Principles and Requirements", which was leaked to the press on 2 February 1996.&lt;ref name="pr2002"/&gt; It was believed that Sinn Féin was objecting to the report's recognition of the "[[principle of consent]]"/"Unionist veto".&lt;ref name="Gillespie2009"/&gt; The Forum published the draft in its "95% agreement" state.&lt;ref name="pr2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fprreport"&gt;See [[#draftreport|Publications]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canary Wharf bombing]] on 9 February ended the IRA ceasefire and, with the continued participation of Sinn Féin in question, the Forum was adjourned.&lt;ref name="Gillespie2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pr2002"/&gt;

===Obstacles in the South to Reconciliation===
Paragraph 6 of the Downing Street Declaration stated in part:&lt;ref name="dsd"/&gt;
:In recognition of the fears of the Unionist community and as a token of his willingness to make a personal contribution to the building up of that necessary trust, the Taoiseach will examine with his colleagues any elements in the democratic life and organisation of the Irish State that can be represented to the Irish Government in the course of political dialogue as a real and substantial threat to their way of life and ethos, or that can be represented as not being fully consistent with a modern democratic and pluralist society, and undertakes to examine any possible ways of removing such obstacles.
Several of the reports the Forum commissioned addressed this issue, and a subcommittee was established on Obstacles in the South to Reconciliation.&lt;ref name="dail20000405"&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2000/04/05/00022.asp Dáil 5 April 2000 p.22]&lt;/ref&gt; It considered the reports and made a draft report recommending changes to the [[Constitution of Ireland]], as well as changing the [[Amhrán na bhFiann|Irish national anthem]] and [[Flag of Ireland|tricolour flag]].&lt;ref name="ind435478"/&gt; Details of its draft proposals were leaked in 1998.&lt;ref name="ind435478"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/threatening-to-sound-death-knell-for-the-angelus-bell-435478.html|title=Threatening to sound death knell for the Angelus bell|last=Dowling|first=Brian|date=11 August 1998|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/drop-the-angelus-and-axe-anthem-435502.html|title=Drop the Angelus and axe anthem|last=Dowling|first=Brian|date=11 August 1998|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Forum was revived in 2002, the draft report was not published as it was felt the intervening events had rendered it obsolete.&lt;ref name="pr2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dail20000405"/&gt;

===Delegates===
There were separate delegations for each political party with elected representatives in either the [[Republic of Ireland]] or [[Northern Ireland]], as well as [[independent (politician)|independent]]s, with "a democratic mandate and a commitment to resolving political differences by exclusively peaceful and democratic means".&lt;ref name="background"/&gt;  Unionist and loyalist parties refused to participate as delegates, though some unionists made presentations to the delegates in the public sessions. The delegations were proportional to parties' electoral strength, as follows:&lt;ref name="members"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fusio.ie/web1/forum/members.html|title=Members of the Forum|publisher=Forum for Peace and Reconciliation|accessdate=5 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990504122003/http://www.fusio.ie/web1/forum/members.html|archivedate=4 May 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later work==
The [[Northern Ireland Forum]] established in 1996 became the focus of the peace process, with the relevance of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation called into question.&lt;ref name="Gillespie2009"/&gt; After the IRA restored its ceasefire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.4ni.co.uk/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=6624|title=Irish Government to reconvene Peace Forum|date=8 November 2002|work=Northern Ireland News|publisher=4NI|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1997, new Taoiseach [[Bertie Ahern]] envisaged further meetings "on an occasional basis".&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1997/11/18/00004.asp Dáil 18 November 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; One was held on 5 December 1997, at which Ahern broached the possibility of amending [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/06/world/dublin-says-it-might-drop-claim-to-north-in-future.html|title=Dublin Says It Might Drop Claim to North in Future|last=Clarity|first=James F.|date=6 December 1997|work=The New York Times|page=8|accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]] this was effected by [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|a 1999 referendum]]. Based on the results of 1996 elections to the Northern Ireland Forum, invitations to the 1997 meeting were received and accepted by the [[Northern Ireland Women's Coalition]] and [[Labour Party of Northern Ireland (1998)|Labour Party of Northern Ireland]] (LPNI) as well as the previous parties.&lt;ref name="pr2002"/&gt; [[Maurice Hayes]] replaced Gordon Wilson among the independent Senators.&lt;ref name="pr2002"/&gt;

Asked about the Forum in 1999, Ahern said:&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1999/11/24/00024.asp Dáil 24 Nov 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;
:I said that I believed, in the context of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, it would be preferable to see the primary axis for future island-wide consultation being the joint parliamentary forum and the independent consultative forum, envisaged in paragraphs 18 and 19, respectively, of [[North-South Ministerial Council|strand two]] of the Good Friday Agreement. In that event, while it would be a matter for the chairperson and the participating parties, I envisage a final concluding meeting of the forum.
There were suggestions that it be revived in 2000 after [[Executive of the 1st Northern Ireland Assembly|the suspension of the Northern Ireland Executive]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2000/03/29/00032.asp Dáil 29 Mar 2000 p.32]&lt;/ref&gt; and again in December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2000/12/13/00007.asp Dáil 13 Dec 2000 p.7]&lt;/ref&gt; Ahern said at the time, "It might come to that point but there are some other ideas we must try first. If it is going nowhere however, I will consider it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/ahern-blair-in-bid-to-restart-north-process-379721.html|title=Ahern, Blair in bid to restart North process|last=McKenna|first=Gene|date=2 March 2000|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reconvened in late 2002 after further suspension of the Assembly following spying allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/2324583.stm |publisher=BBC |date=14 October 2002 |title=Reid set to suspend assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.4ni.co.uk/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=6403|title=Cross-border peace forum is 'waste of time' says Nesbitt - Northern Ireland News|last=McG|first=G|date=27 November 2002|work=Northern Ireland News|publisher=4NI|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Catherine McGuinness had in the meantime been appointed to the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]], Maurice Hayes replaced her as chairman.&lt;ref name="pr2002"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Government_Press_Office/Government_Press_Releases_2008/Government_Press_Releases_2002/Reconvening_of_Forum_for_Peace_and_Reconciliation.html |title=Reconvening of Forum for Peace and Reconciliation |date=7 November 2002 |publisher=Department of the Taoiseach |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710080237/http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Government_Press_Office/Government_Press_Releases_2008/Government_Press_Releases_2002/Reconvening_of_Forum_for_Peace_and_Reconciliation.html |archivedate=10 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the 1997 delegates, the LPNI was absent while the [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party]] was present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sluggerotoole.com/2002/11/28/forum-for-peace-and-reconciliation/ Forum for Peace and Reconciliation] [[Slugger O'Toole]]&lt;/ref&gt; One session discussed the [[Holy Cross dispute]] in Belfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/holy-cross-priest-reveals-loyalist-death-threats-85272.html|title=Holy Cross priest reveals loyalist death threats|date=22 January 2003|work=BreakingNews.ie|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forum's 2002–3 meetings failed to ameliorate the deadlock in the peace process.&lt;ref name="Gillespie2009"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13439">'''Government Accountability Office investigations of the Department of Defense''' (DoD) are typically [[audit]]s in which the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), the [[United States Congress]]' investigative arm, studies how the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] spends taxpayer dollars. Since the GAO is accountable only to the legislative branch, it is in a unique position to investigate the military; no other agency can audit Federal departments with the same degree of independence from the President. However, the GAO is still subject to influence from powerful members of Congress.  As of March 2016, the DoD was the only government agency to have failed every audit since all government agencies were required to pass such audits by the [[Chief Financial Officers Act]] of 1990.&lt;ref name="Smithberger"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smithberger|first1=Mandy|title=Will the Pentagon Ever Be Able to Be Audited?|url=http://www.pogo.org/straus/issues/defense-budget/2016/will-the-pentagon-ever-be.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/|website=Project on Government Oversight|accessdate=2016-12-01|date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two examples of major GAO investigations in the 2000s were the audits of [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and Defense Department airline reimbursements.

==Major investigations==

===Operation Iraqi Freedom===
GAO investigations into Operation Iraqi Freedom revealed a number of accounting problems, ranging from the mundane to the severe. Pay irregularities were a chronic problem. In 2004 the GAO reported that 450 of the 481 [[Army National Guard]] soldiers from six [[Special Forces]] units had at least one pay problem associated with their mobilization impacting 94 percent of the soldiers. The report found that the DoD's inability to provide timely and accurate payments to these soldiers, many of whom risked their lives in [[Iraq]] or [[Afghanistan]], distracted them from their missions, imposed financial hardships on the soldiers and their families and may reduce retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Procurement]] irregularities included [[Halliburton]] charging the government $5 for hot meals they got from a Kuwaiti subcontractor, Timimmi, for $3 each.  In one camp in July 2003 they "billed the government for an average 42,000 meals a day but served only 14,000. In a seven-month period, alleged overcharging in that camp totalled $16m."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Teather|first1=David|title=Halliburton suspends bill for army meals: 'Overcharging' by Cheney's old firm becomes election issue|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/feb/18/iraq.usa|accessdate=2017-02-27|publisher=The Guardian|date=2004-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the investigation into Iraqi Freedom progressed, it began turning up worse and worse procurement problems. GAO [[auditor]]s caught the Department selling new chemical and biological protective garments on the Internet for $3 each. At the same time, the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] was buying identical garments elsewhere for more than $200 apiece. Other accounting snafus resulted in the [[United States Army|Army]] losing track of 56 [[airplane]]s, 32 [[tank]]s, and 36 [[FGM-148 Javelin|Javelin]] missile command launch-units.  In May 2003 SFGATE reported $1 trillion missing.&lt;ref name="SFGATE"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abate|first1=Tom|title=Military waste under fire / $1 trillion missing -- Bush plan targets Pentagon accounting|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Military-waste-under-fire-1-trillion-missing-2616120.php|accessdate=2017-02-27|publisher=SFGATE|date=2003-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAO found that the waste encountered in Iraq is symptomatic of a wider inventory-control problem. More than 200 inventory-control systems at the Defense Department still are not integrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The GAO notes, "Poor communication between services within the Department of Defense and improper accounting results in the disposal of needed spare parts and the purchase of duplicative parts worth millions of dollars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/defazio/102699DERelease.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406033457/http://www.house.gov/defazio/102699DERelease.htm |archivedate=2005-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airline reimbursements===
A more recent GAO investigation revealed $100 million in wasted airline fees. The [[Associated Press]] notes that the Defense Department spent an estimated $100 million for airline tickets that were not used over six years and failed to seek refunds even though the tickets were reimbursable. The Department also reimbursed employees for airline tickets that had been purchased by the Department. To demonstrate how easy it was to have the Pentagon pay for airline travel, the investigators posed as Defense employees, had the department generate a ticket and showed up at the ticket counter to pick up a boarding pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Defense Department drops $100M on unused airline tickets|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/news/2004-06-09-pentagon-flights_x.htm|accessdate=2017-02-27|publisher=USA Today|date=2004-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAO also uncovered several incidences of airline-related fraud. One DoD traveler used a Department account number to pay for more than 70 airline tickets totaling more than $60,000. He then sold them at a discount to coworkers and family members for personal travel. Another employee admitted to "accidentally" claiming reimbursement for $10,000 worth of airline tickets that had been paid for by the Department.

==GAO influence over Defense Department reform==

===Defense Department responses to investigations===
There is evidence that GAO investigations are encouraging the Department to reform. The Halliburton contract was re-negotiated and assigned directly to Timimmi. And Dov Zakheim, chief financial officer for the Pentagon, said, "We are overhauling our financial management system precisely because people like &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Comptroller General of the United States|GAO Comptroller General]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[David M. Walker (U.S. Comptroller General)|David Walker]] are rightly critical of it".&lt;ref name="SFGATE"/&gt;

These audits appear to have been more effective at prompting reform than the Defense Department's own initiatives. In 1989, the Department began attempting to unify more than 2,000 overlapping systems used for billing, inventory, and personnel. But after spending $20 billion, the initiative was abandoned. Gregory Kutz, director of GAO's financial management division, noted the Pentagon's weak fiscal control over its subsidiaries – the Army, [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] – saying, "The [Pentagon's] inability to even complete an audit shows just how far they have to go."&lt;ref name="SFGATE"/&gt;

===Threats to GAO independence===
Scholars believe, however, that the GAO's authority could be undermined in the wake of a landmark case, Walker vs. Cheney. This Federal lawsuit pertained to a GAO investigation into the Bush Administration's Energy Task Force. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Cheney]] refused to disclose which individuals and groups met with the Task Force, prompting Walker to sue for the information in Federal court. In December 2002, the court ruled for Cheney.

Congressional pressure persuaded Walker to abandon appeals. Having vowed to "go to the mat," he originally planned to pursue the case further. But according to the [[w:Center for Effective Government|Center for Effective Government]],

The [[Center for Effective Government]] reported that, "Sen. [[Ted Stevens]] (R-AK), chairman of the Appropriations Committee, met with GAO Comptroller General David Walker earlier in [2003], and sources have reported that sharp cuts in the GAO $440 million budget were threatened if the lawsuit was pursued further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GAO Authority Undermined|url=http://www.foreffectivegov.org/node/1244|website=foreffectivegov.org|publisher=Center for Effective Government|accessdate=2017-02-27|date=2003-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAO was designed to be independent, and Walker cites several factors insulating his agency from political pressure. In a Roll Call op-ed, he remarks, "To begin with, our location in the legislative branch gives us some distance from the executive branches we audit and oversee. Moreover, the head of GAO serves a 15-year term, which gives the agency a continuity of leadership that is rare in the federal government. GAO's independence is further safeguarded by the fact that its workforce consists of career civil servants hired on the basis of their knowledge, skill, and ability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=David M.|title=GAO Answers the Question: What's in a Name?|url=http://www.gao.gov/about/rollcall07192004.pdf|website=Government Accountability Office|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=2017-02-27|date=2004-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the GAO, like all federal agencies, is subject to Congress' budgetary power. According to ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', "Walker did say . . . that several lawmakers have threatened in the past year to cut agency funding if it persisted with the controversial lawsuit. He also said the budget threat was among a number of factors that tipped his Feb. 7 decision to halt litigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Brand | first1 = Peter | last2 = Bolton | first2 = Alexander
| title = GOP Threats Stopped GAO  From Filing Suit Against Cheney | url=http://rense.com/general34/gao.htm|accessdate=2017-02-27|agency=The Hill|date=2003-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to tell whether curtailed GAO independence will threaten Defense Department reform. Some aspects of Defense Department accounting have resisted reform for decades. Danielle Brian, director of the nonprofit [[Project on Government Oversight]], says, "Waste has become ingrained in the Defense budget because opposition to defense spending is portrayed as unpatriotic, and legislators are often more concerned about winning Pentagon [[pork barrel|pork]] than controlling defense waste."&lt;ref name="SFGATE"/&gt;

But even Representatives who generally support Defense spending seem to be getting fed up with the problem. Representative [[Thomas M. Davis]], R-Virginia, asked the Pentagon to present 11 documents relating to contracts in Iraq, among them papers that would prove whether Halliburton benefited from its association with Cheney. And Rep. [[Jimmy Duncan (U.S. politician)|John Duncan]], R-Tenn., of the House Committee on Government Reform recently said, "I've always considered myself to be a pro-military type person, but that doesn't mean I just want to sit back and watch the Pentagon waste billions and billions of dollars."&lt;ref name="SFGATE"/&gt;

Supporters of the GAO investigations like to point out the disparity between the GAO budget and military expenses. The GAO's [[fiscal year|Fiscal Year]] 2016 annual budget was $555 million, with "Measurable financial benefits from GAO work:	$63.4 billion--a return of about $112 on every dollar invested in GAO."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2016 | title=GAO at a Glance|url=http://www.gao.gov/about/gglance.html|website=Government Accountability Office|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, GAO reports show that the Defense Department's 2,200 overlapping financial systems cost $18 billion a year to operate.&lt;ref name="SFGATE"/&gt;

In March 2016, the [[Project on Government Oversight]] reported that, "The Department of Defense remains the only federal agency that can't get a clean audit".

'''''Heaven and Earth: Global Warming – The Missing Science''''' is a [[popular science]] book published in 2009 and written by Australian [[geologist]], [[professor]] of [[mining geology]] at [[Adelaide University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The University of Adelaide Staff Directory|url=http://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/ian.plimer|publisher=University of Adelaide|date=28 March 2010|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mining company director [[Ian Plimer]]. It disputes the [[scientific consensus on climate change]], including the view that [[global warming]] is "very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic (man-made) greenhouse gas concentrations"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf | title=IPCC AR4 Summary for Policymakers | publisher=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and asserts that the debate is being driven by what the author regards as irrational and unscientific elements.

The book received what ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper called "glowing endorsements" from the conservative press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Age|title=The sceptic's shadow of doubt|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/the-sceptics-shadow-of-doubt-20090501-aqa1.html?page=-1|accessdate=30 March 2010|date=2 May 2009|first=Adam|last=Morton | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Australian]]'' said it gave "all the scientific ammunition climate change skeptics could want."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sceptic-spells-doom-for-alarmists/story-e6frg6xo-1225700037091 |title=Sceptic spells doom for alarmists &amp;#124; The Australian |publisher=www.theaustralian.com.au |accessdate=2010-03-28 |date=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviewers criticised the book as unscientific, inaccurate, based on obsolete research, and internally inconsistent. Ideas in it have been described as "so wrong as to be laughable".&lt;ref name= "ashley"/&gt;

''Heaven and Earth'' was a bestseller in Australia when published in May 2009, and is in its seventh printing, according to the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.connorcourt.com/catalog1/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=7&amp;products_id=103&amp;zenid=3c05f7db155e1ae050c97e9597f00e44 |title=Heaven and Earth Global Warming...

== Background ==
''Heaven and Earth'' is a sequel to a previous work by Plimer called ''A Short History of Planet Earth''. Published in 2001, ''A Short History'' was based on a decade's worth of radio broadcasts by Plimer aimed mainly at rural Australians. It became a bestseller and won a [[Eureka Prize]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eureka: A Short History of Planet Earth|url=http://eureka.australianmuseum.net.au/7F923342-9A53-0F79-BF02023316166B60|accessdate=20 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016052918/http://eureka.australianmuseum.net.au/7F923342-9A53-0F79-BF02023316166B60|archive-date=16 October 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Plimer was unable to find any major publisher willing to publish his follow-up book. He attributed this to there being "a lot of fear out there. No one wants to go against the popular paradigm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Senior|first=Antonia|title=Blunt warning about greens under the bed|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article6725471.ece|newspaper=The Times|date=24 July 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plimer turned to [[Connor Court Publishing]]. The company has a history of publishing books on "culture, justice and religion", including many books on [[Christianity]] and [[Catholicism]] in particular. It has also published fellow Australian [[climate change skeptic]] [[Garth Paltridge]]'s book, ''The Climate Caper'', which likewise criticises the climate change consensus and the "politicisation of science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ballan publisher in heaven after coup|url=http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/ballan-publisher-in-heaven-after-coup/1553105.aspx?storypage=0|work=The Courier|date=28 June 2009|accessdate=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Crikey]],'' an Australian [[webzine]], commented that the publication of ''Heaven and Earth'' was a coup for conservatives, and said of the publisher: "The conservatives have a new friend in publishing".&lt;ref name="crikey"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2009/04/20/plimers-heaven-and-earth-a-conservative-coup/ |title=Plimer’s Heaven and Earth: a conservative coup? |accessdate=2009-08-09 |publisher=crikey.com.au |author=Andrew Dodd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Plimer, he wrote ''Heaven and Earth'' after being "incensed by increasing public acceptance of the idea that humans have caused global warming" and set out to "knock out every single argument we hear about climate change." Although he does not dispute that climate change is happening, he argues that "It's got nothing to do with the atmosphere, it's about what happens in the galaxy" and that climate is driven by the sun, the Earth's orbit and plate tectonics rather than the levels of atmospheric [[greenhouse gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="adl"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jenkin|first=Cara|title=Humans are `not hurting' the climate|url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,25325285-5006301,00.html|work=The Advertiser|date=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plimer says his book is for the "average punter in the street" who can "smell something is wrong in the climate debate but can't put a finger on what."&lt;ref name="age"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/the-sceptics-shadow-of-doubt-20090501-aqa1.html?page=-1 |title=The sceptic's shadow of doubt |publisher=theage.com.au |accessdate=2009-05-22 | location=Melbourne | first=Adam | last=Morton | date=2 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have regularly questioned Plimer about his commercial interests in the mining industry,&lt;ref name="coi"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,25555783-5018662,00.html |title=AdelaideNow... Why I'd put global warming on ice |publisher=www.news.com.au |accessdate=2009-08-30 | date=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he defends the independence of his views, saying that these commercial interests do not colour his arguments, which are based on pure science. Critics note that Plimer has opposed a [[carbon emission trading|carbon trading]] scheme in Australia, saying that "it would probably destroy [the mining industry] totally".&lt;ref name="destroy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/business/items/200811/s2416977.htm |title=Lateline Business - 11/11/2008: Ian Plimer joins Lateline Business |publisher=www.abc.net.au |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
In the book, Plimer likens the concept of human-induced climate change to [[creationism]] and asserts that it is a "fundamentalist religion adopted by urban [[atheism|atheists]] looking to fill a yawning spiritual gap plaguing the West". Environmental groups are claimed to have filled this gap by having a romantic view of a less developed past. The book is critical of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), which he claims has allowed "little or no geological, archeological or historical input" in its analyses.&lt;ref name="age" /&gt; If it had, the book asserts, the IPCC would know cold times lead to dwindling populations, social disruption, extinction, disease and catastrophic droughts, while warm times lead to life blossoming and economic booms – suggesting that global warming, whether or not caused by humans, should be welcomed.&lt;ref name="age" /&gt;

The book is critical of political efforts to address climate change and argues that extreme environmental changes are inevitable and unavoidable.&lt;ref name="adl" /&gt; Meteorologists have a huge amount to gain from climate change research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2008/s2554129.htm |title=Lateline - 27/04/2009: Ian Plimer discusses his book denying global warming |publisher=www.abc.net.au |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the book claims, and they have narrowed the climate change debate to the atmosphere, whereas the truth is more complex. Money would be better directed to dealing with problems as they occur rather than making expensive and futile attempts to prevent climate change.

The book differs from the scientific consensus in contending that the [[Great Barrier Reef#Climate change|Great Barrier Reef]] will benefit from rising seas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/stories/s2655036.htm |title=Unleashed: Legislative time bomb |publisher=www.abc.net.au |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there is no correlation between [[Greenhouse effect#Greenhouse gases|carbon dioxide]] levels and temperature, and that 98% of the greenhouse effect is due to [[Greenhouse effect#Greenhouse gases|water vapour]].

In the book, Plimer asserts that the current theory of human-induced global warming is not in accord with history, archaeology, geology or astronomy and must be rejected, that promotion of this theory as science is fraudulent, and that the current alarm over climate change is the result of bad science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Akerman |first=Piers |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21540128-5007146,00.html |title=ABC scaremongering on the environment &amp;#124; Opinion |publisher=News.com.au |date=12 April 2007 |accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/cool-heads-missing/2007/04/05/1175366406378.html |title=Cool heads missing in the pressure cooker – Environment |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date= 2007-04-06|accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that [[climate model]]s focus too strongly on the effects of [[carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]], rather than factoring in other issues such as [[solar variation]],&lt;ref name="sheehan" /&gt; the effect of [[Cloud feedback|clouds]],&lt;ref name="pl-787"/&gt; and unreliable [[Instrumental temperature record|temperature measurements]].&lt;ref name="pl-787"/&gt;

== Reception and criticism ==
''Heaven and Earth'' received substantial coverage in the Australian and international media. It produced a highly polarised response from reviewers, with members of the conservative press&lt;ref name="age" /&gt; praising the book and many scientists criticising it. A ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' columnist called the book "a damning critique" of the theory of man-made global warming,&lt;ref name=Strassel /&gt; while the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' writer and activist [[George Monbiot]] listed some of the book's errors with the comment: "Seldom has a book been more cleanly murdered by scientists than Ian Plimer's ''Heaven and Earth'', which purports to show that manmade climate change is nonsense. Since its publication in Australia it has been ridiculed for a hilarious series of schoolboy errors, and its fudging and manipulation of the data."&lt;ref name="Monbiot" /&gt;

=== Reactions from scientists ===
Canadian broadcaster [[John Moore (broadcaster)|John Moore]] said it was "widely criticised by fellow scientists as just another collection of denier hits."&lt;ref name="criticized"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2009/07/16/john-moore-one-world-government-and-global-warming-climate-change-whatever.aspx |title=One world government and global warming/climate change/whatever |accessdate=2009-07-24 |publisher=National Post |author=John Moore |date=May 2009 |quote=book that has been widely criticised by fellow scientists as just another collection of denier hits |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/5iQw7vsEY?url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2009/07/16/john%2Dmoore%2Done%2Dworld%2Dgovernment%2Dand%2Dglobal%2Dwarming%2Dclimate%2Dchange%2Dwhatever.aspx |archive-date=21 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Adelaide Advertiser]]'' stated that among other scientists, "Plimer is all but out in the cold".&lt;ref name="coi"/&gt;

Barry Brook of [[University of Adelaide|Adelaide University's]] Research Institute for Climate Change and Sustainability, who is at the same university as Plimer and has debated climate change issues with him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independentweekly.com.au/news/local/news/general/ian-plimer-a-question-of-faith/1495699.aspx?storypage=0 |title=Ian Plimer: A question of faith - Local News - News - General - The Independent Weekly |publisher=independentweekly.com.au |accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; described the book as a case study "in how not to be objective" and accused Plimer of using "[[Cherry picking (fallacy)|selective evidence]]". Brook said that Plimer's "stated view of climate science is that a vast number of extremely well respected scientists and a whole range of specialist disciplines have fallen prey to delusional self-interest and become nothing more than unthinking ideologues. Plausible to conspiracy theorists, perhaps, but hardly a sane world view, and insulting to all those genuinely committed to real science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Verity|title=Climate sceptics ready to storm heaven with earth's geological history|work=The Australian|date=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that Plimer's assertions about man's role in climate change were "naive, reflected a poor understanding of climate science, and relied on recycled and distorted arguments that had been repeatedly refuted."&lt;ref name="brook-pl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bravenewclimate.com/2009/04/23/ian-plimer-heaven-and-earth/ |title=Ian Plimer – Heaven and Earth |accessdate=2009-07-05 |publisher=BraveNewClimate.com |author=Barry Brook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brook also suggested that many of the scientific authors cited by Plimer actually support the consensus view and that their work is misrepresented in Plimer's book.&lt;ref name="brook-pl"/&gt; Susannah Eliott, the chief executive of the [[Australian Science Media Centre]], encouraged colleagues to read the book and comment on it, but took the view that "there isn't anything new in there, they are all old arguments".&lt;ref name="Peddie" /&gt;

Many reviewers highlighted factual and sourcing problems in ''Heaven and Earth''. [[Colin Woodroffe]], a coastal geomorphologist at the [[University of Wollongong]], and a lead chapter author for the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] [[AR4]], wrote that the book has many errors and will be "remembered for the confrontation it provokes rather than the science it stimulates." Woodroffe noted Plimer's "unbalanced approach to the topic," and concluded that the book was not written as a contribution to any scientific debate, and was evidently not aimed at a scientific audience.&lt;ref name=aussmc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aussmc.org.au/IanPlimerclimatebook.php|title=RAPID ROUNDUP: New book by Ian Plimer doubts human-induced climate change – experts respond|publisher=Australian Science Media Centre|date=21 April 2009|accessdate=20 July 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829095234/http://www.aussmc.org.au/IanPlimerclimatebook.php|archivedate=29 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Veron|Charlie Veron]], former chief scientist at the [[Australian Institute of Marine Science]], said every original statement Plimer makes in the book on coral and coral reefs is incorrect, and that Plimer "serve[s] up diagrams from no acknowledged source, diagrams known to be obsolete and diagrams that combine bits of science with bits of fiction."&lt;ref name="age" /&gt;

[[David Karoly]], an [[Meteorology#Dynamic meteorology|atmospheric dynamicist]] at [[Melbourne University]] and a lead author for the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSSYD334528|title=Scientists say Australian carbon targets too weak|first=James|last=Grubel|publisher=Reuters|date=8 September 2008|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; accused Plimer of misusing data in the book and commented that "it doesn't support the answers with sources."&lt;ref name="age" /&gt; Karoly reviewed the book and concluded: "Given the errors, the non-science, and the nonsense in this book, it should be classified as [[science fiction]] in any library that wastes its funds buying it. The book can then be placed on the shelves alongside [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[State of Fear]]'', another science fiction book about climate change with many footnotes. The only difference is that there are fewer scientific errors in ''State of Fear''."&lt;ref name="scifi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2009/2593166.htm |title=Heaven + Earth – review by David Karoly |accessdate=2009-07-11 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian G. Enting]], a mathematical physicist at [[MASCOS]], [[University of Melbourne]] and author of ''[[Twisted, The Distorted Mathematics of Greenhouse Denial]]'', similarly criticised what he described as numerous misrepresentations of the sources cited in the book and charged that Plimer "fails to establish his claim that the human inﬂuence on climate can be ignored, relative to natural variation."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.org.au/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=91|format=PDF|title=Ian Plimer’s ‘Heaven + Earth’ — Checking the Claims |publisher=ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematics and Statistics of Complex Systems (MASCOS)|date=10 June 2009|accessdate=20 July 2009|last=Enting|first=Ian G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enting compiled a list of over 100 errors in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|accessdate=30 March 2010|publisher=University of Melbourne|title=Ian Plimer's 'Heaven + Earth'—Checking the Claims|url=http://www.complex.org.au/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=91|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Ashley (astronomer)|Michael Ashley]], an astronomer at the [[University of New South Wales]], criticised the book at length in a review for ''The Australian'' in which he characterised the book as "largely a collection of contrarian ideas and conspiracy theories that are rife in the blogosphere. The writing is rambling and repetitive; the arguments flawed and illogical." He accused Plimer of having "done an enormous disservice to science, and the dedicated scientists who are trying to understand climate and the influence of humans, by publishing this book. It is not "merely" atmospheric scientists that would have to be wrong for Plimer to be right. It would require a rewriting of biology, geology, physics, oceanography, astronomy and statistics. Plimer's book deserves to languish on the shelves along with similar pseudo-science such as the writings of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] and [[Erich von Däniken]]."&lt;ref name="ashley"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ashley|first=Michael|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/ian-plimer-heaven-and-earth/story-e6frg8no-1225710387147 |title=No science in Plimer's primer |accessdate=2009-07-11 |work=The Australian |date=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm Walter, the Director of the Australian Centre for [[Astrobiology]], [[University of New South Wales]], commented on Plimer's "fallacious reasoning," noting the "blatant and fundamental contradictions" and inconsistencies in the book. Walter told [[ABC Radio National]] that Plimer's interpretation of the literature is confused and that Plimer "bit off more than he can chew." According to Walter, "reviewing this book has been an unpleasant experience for me. I have been a friendly colleague of Plimer's for 25 years or more. ... But..., in my opinion, he has done a disservice to science and to the community at large."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2009/2586947.htm|title=Heaven + Earth – review by Malcolm Walter|publisher=The Science Show – ABC Radio National|date=6 June 2009|accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same network, [[geophysicist]] [[Kurt Lambeck]], currently president of the [[Australian Academy of Science]], said that the book was "sloppy" and that it "is not a work of science; it is an opinion of an author who happens to be a scientist."&lt;ref name="Lambeck"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/ockhamsrazor/stories/2009/2589206.htm|title=Comments on Heaven and Earth: Global Warming: The Missing Science|publisher=The Science Show – ABC Radio National|date=7 June 2009|accessdate=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chris Turney]], a researcher of prehistoric climate changes, of the [[University of Exeter]]'s Department of Geography, stated the book was "a cacophony of climate skeptic arguments that have been discredited by decades of research." He described the number of errors in the book as "disturbingly high": "statements that are at best ambiguous and in many cases plain wrong are repeated, figures purporting to demonstrate climate change is all natural are erroneous, time and spatial scales are mixed up . . . the list goes on." Turney comments that Plimer "badly mistreats" the history of the development of climate science, "regurgitating" the fringe idea of [[global cooling]] to portray "recent concerns over warming [as] just another case of alarmism." He concludes that "Plimer's thesis of inaction is a course we follow at our peril."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turney|first=Chris|title=Grievous heavenly harm|work=The Age|date=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[Earth (magazine)|Earth]]'' magazine, emeritus [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] geologist Terry Gerlach commented that the book "illustrates one of the pathways by which myths, misrepresentations and spurious information get injected into the climate change debate." He highlighted Plimer's inaccurate claims about volcanic emissions of carbon dioxide and noted that Plimer had failed to provide estimates of present-day global carbon dioxide emission rate from volcanoes. In Gerlach's view, this was ironic considering that the book professes to provide the "missing science" on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voices: Volcanic versus anthropogenic carbon dioxide: The missing science|author=Gerlach, Terry|date=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retired meteorologist [[William Kininmonth (meteorologist)|William Kininmonth]], a long-standing critic of climate change theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fyfe|first=Melissa|title=The global warming sceptics|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/11/26/1101219743320.html|work=The Age|date=27 November 2004|accessdate=21 July 2009 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported the book in a commentary published in ''The Australian'' in which he wrote that "Plimer's authoritative book provides the excuse and impetus to re-examine the scientific fundamentals [of climate change]."&lt;ref name="Kininmonth"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kinimonth|first=William|title=Cold, hard facts dispel theories on warming|work=The Australian|date=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leigh Dayton, science writer for ''[[The Australian]]'', expressed dismay at Plimer for having "boarded the denialist ark" and described his arguments, such as his claims that scientists had been playing along with the view of human-induced climate change "in order to keep the research dollars flowing", as "a load of old [[codswallop]]". Dayton criticised Plimer's "shaky assumptions" and "misinformation", describing his assertion that the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]'s scientists "whip up scary agenda-driven scenarios" as "fanciful".&lt;ref name="wobbly"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25433327-7583,00.html |title=Denialist ark a wobbly craft |accessdate=2009-08-09 |publisher=The Australian |author=Leigh Dayton |date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Times]]'', [[Bob Ward (communications director)|Bob Ward]] called the book an angry, bitter and error-strewn polemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article6804961.ece |title=Heaven and Earth by Ian Plimer - Times Online |publisher=timesonline.co.uk |accessdate=2009-08-30 | location=London | date=22 August 2009 | first=Bob | last=Ward}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that Plimer "uses geology as an excuse to conclude the opposite of mainstream climate science", and that it is "hard to work out how and why he managed to produce such a controversial and flawed account."

''The Australian's'' coverage of ''Heaven and Earth'' attracted criticism from [[Robert Manne]], a lecturer on politics at [[La Trobe University]] in [[Melbourne]], who criticised the "gushing praise" given the book. Manne deplored the willingness of ''The Australian'' to "give books such as [Plimer's] the kind of enthusiastic welcome hundreds of others published in this country every year cannot dream of receiving", calling this "a grave intellectual, political and moral mistake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Manne|first=Robert|title=Cheerleading for zealotry not in the public interest|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25380219-7583,00.html|work=The Australian|date=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[George Monbiot]] criticised ''[[The Spectator]]'' for featuring ''Heaven and Earth'' as a cover story, calling it "one of the gravest misjudgments in journalism this year" since "a quick check would have shown that [the book is] utter nonsense".&lt;ref name="Monbiot"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/jul/09/george-monbiot-ian-plimer|title=Spectator recycles climate rubbish published by sceptic|first=George|last=Monbiot|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 July 2009|accessdate=30 March 2010 | location=London|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10081">[[File:Helen Marot 1904.jpg|thumb|right|Helen Marot was a progressive librarian and labor movement activist.]]
'''Helen Marot''' (June 9, 1865 – June 3, 1940) was an American writer, librarian, and labor organizer. She is best remembered for her efforts to address child labor and improve the working conditions of women. She was from [[Philadelphia]] and became active in investigating working conditions among children and women. As a librarian, she worked at several important institutions and helped organize the Free Library of Economics and Political Science in 1897. Marot was a member of the [[Women's Trade Union League]]. She later organized the Bookkeepers, Stenographers and Accountants Union in New York. In 1912, she was part of a commission that investigated the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire]]. She was an active writer and her articles about the [[labor movement]] appeared in many periodicals of the day.

==Early life==
Marot was born on June 9, 1865 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She grew up in an affluent family and received a [[Quakers|Quaker]] education. From 1895 to 1896, Marot was the literary editor of ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'' where she was responsible for answering literary queries to the magazine. During this time, she compiled a 288-page reader's guide containing over 5,000 books. Included were some 170 author summaries.&lt;ref name="Nutter"/&gt;

==Early library work==
Marot left ''Ladies' Home Journal'' in April 1896 to organize the King Library of the Church of the Redeemer in [[Andalusia, Pennsylvania]]. In September 1896 she worked as a librarian in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] as a cataloger. She stayed at the library for three years. The head librarian at the time, Enos L. Doan, remarked on her work: "She brought to it taste and literary discrimination of a high order—qualities which, in addition to her thorough technical training, gave her unusual efficiency in the performance of her duties."&lt;ref name="Nutter"/&gt;

==The Free Library of Economics and Political Science==
In 1897 Marot, along with Dr. [[George M. Gould]] and Innes Forbes, opened a private library specializing in works on social and economic topics. The Free Library of Economics and Political Science concentrated on issues relating to social and economic reform and was greatly influenced by The Fabian Society, a [[socialism|socialist]] organization. It was located on the second floor of a department store on Filbert Street in Philadelphia.

The ''[[Philadelphia Record]]'' described the library in its pages on June 15, 1897:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Philadelphia has been enriched with a library distinctively modern and progressive in spirit... The new library forms an important supplement to the municipal system, since the topics of the day and the problems of the industrial and sociological world cannot be thoroughly followed by an institution for the general circulation of books. With its proposed technical classification of magazine literature and an accessible collection of pamphlets and volumes, the Library of Economics should become a powerful factor for civic and social education in the community and Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="Gaudioso"&gt;Gaudioso, M. (1992). Helen Marot: Librarian, 1865-1901. (Order No. 1350082, San Jose State University). ProQuest Dissertations and Theses.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marot explained the importance of the library in 1902: "It was founded on the idea that freely offered opportunities from education in economics and political science make directly for a more intelligent public opinion and a higher citizenship."&lt;ref name="Gaudioso"/&gt;

The collection included foreign and domestic literature. It consisted of six hundred books, over two thousand pamphlets, and ninety-one periodicals. This literature, more particularly the periodicals, was not found elsewhere and thus met a most specific community need. The entire collection was donated by individuals and various organizations such as [[American Academy of Political and Social Science]], [[Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences]], Church Social Union, Civic Club of Philadelphia, Direct Legislation League, ''[[Englishwoman's Review]]'', Fabian Society, Humboldt Publishing Company, [[Independent Labour Party]], [[Indian Rights Association]], Labor Exchange, and Land Nationalization League, among others.

To keep up to date with current information, the library collected news clippings and government publications, reports of labor societies, and other similar works. Indeed, a considerable part of the collection consisted of government, state, and municipal reports received from the United States government, the different states, the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], and [[New South Wales]]. Although the collection was small, teachers, students, and library patrons found its classified and indexed pamphlets and magazine literature concerning present-day problems to be satisfactory.

In addition, the patrons could purchase books and were permitted to check out books when they were unable to come to the reading room during library hours. The library was open daily from 11 a.m. until 6 p.m. and on Sunday, until 10 p.m. The small library soon became "the center of liberal thought in Philadelphia"—a popular gathering place for Philadelphian reformers and socialists. In addition to the usual work of a special library, public and private lectures and classes were given to different associations. Besides being the chairwoman of the library committee, Marot was also on the lectures committee, which were all well attended, the rooms being, in fact, more than filled.

The first lecture addressed the topic of "The Economics of Socialism." It was given free on October 30, 1897 by [[Ramsay MacDonald|James R. MacDonald]] of the London [[Fabian Society]] and future [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. At the second meeting, on February 8, 1898, Professor [[Joseph French Johnson]], Dr. [[Henry Rogers Seager]], Charles Richardson, and Professor William I. Hull discussed and lectured on "Education in Economics." On March 19, 1898 a lecture on "Economic Education, the Salvation of Society" was given by Dr. [[Daniel Garrison Brinton|Daniel G. Brinton]].

Through her library, Helen Marot participated in educating Philadelphians to social changes and pursued the socialist cause for building a more just and humane society with perseverance, courage, and a combination of hardheaded realism and guileless romanticism.&lt;ref name="Gaudioso"/&gt;

==Labor and publishing work==

In 1899 she published ''A Handbook of Labor Literature'' and also conducted and investigation for the [[Industrial Commission|U.S. Industrial Commission]] into working conditions in the custom tailoring trades in Philadelphia. In 1902 Marot investigated child labor in New York City for the [[Association of Neighborhood Workers]] and helped form the [[New York Child Labor Committee]]. With [[Florence Kelley]] and [[Josephine Clara Goldmark]] she drew up a report on child labor in the city that influential in the passage of the [[1903 Compulsory Education Act]] by the state legislature.&lt;ref name="Nutter"&gt;Nutter, K. (2010). Helen Marot. American National Biography. Available from: Gale Virtual Reference Library, Ipswich, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 Marot became executive secretary of the New York branch of the national [[Women's Trade Union League]]. Marot also was responsible for creating the Bookkeepers, Stenographers and Accountants Union of New York. She was the organizer and leader of the first great strike of shirtwaist makers and dressmakers (1909–10) under the banner of the new [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]].

In 1913, Marot resigned from her work with the trade union league. In 1914, she published ''American Labor Unions'' (1914), a work on the syndicalist [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. She then served on the editorial board of ''[[The Masses]]'' (1916–17), a radical journal. After, she then served on the staff of ''[[The Dial]]'' (1918–20). She was also a member of the [[Commission on Industrial Relations|U.S. Industrial Relations Commission]] (1914–16).&lt;ref name="Nutter"/&gt;

Helen Marot lived with her life partner, progressive educational reformer [[Caroline Pratt (educator)|Caroline Pratt]], until her death in on June 3, 1940, in New York, New York.

An '''industrial policy''' of a country, sometimes denoted '''IP''', is its official strategic effort to encourage the development and growth of part or all of the [[manufacturing]] sector as well as other sectors of the economy.{{sfn|Graham|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=My9sL1iKQm8C&amp;pg=PA3 3]}}{{sfn|Bingham|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nyF0zNh68ooC&amp;pg=PA21 21]}}{{sfn|Rodrik|2004|p=2. Rodrik uses the term in a more extended fashion, such as to encompass "non-traditional activities in agriculture or services. There is no evidence that the types of market failures that call for industrial policy are located predominantly in industry" }} The government takes measures "aimed at improving the competitiveness and capabilities of domestic firms and promoting structural transformation."{{sfn|UNCTAD|UNIDO|2011|p=34}} A country's [[infrastructure]] (transportation, telecommunications and [[energy industry]]) is a major part of the manufacturing sector that often has a key role in IP.&lt;ref&gt;For the relations between industrial policy and infrastructure, see Koh, Jae Myong (2018) ''Green Infrastructure Financing: Institutional Investors, PPPs and Bankable Projects'', Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 12–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial policies are sector-specific, unlike broader macroeconomic policies. Examples of the latter, which are horizontal, economy-wide policies, are tightening credit and taxing capital gains. Traditional examples of industrial policy that involves vertical, sector-specific policies, include protecting textiles from imports and subsidizing export industries. More contemporary industrial policies include measures such as support for linkages between firms and support for upstream technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wear|first1=Andrew|title=Industry policy emerges from globalisation resurgent and more important than ever|url=http://www.themandarin.com.au/74425-industry-policy-emerges-from-globalisation-resurgent/|website=The Mandarin|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial policies are [[economic interventionism|interventionist]] measures typical of [[mixed economy]] countries.

Many types of industrial policies contain common elements with other types of interventionist practices such as [[trade policy]] and [[fiscal policy]]. An example of a typical industrial policy is [[import-substitution-industrialization]] (ISI), where trade barriers are temporarily imposed on some key sectors, such as manufacturing.{{sfn|Krugman|1987}} By selectively protecting certain industries, these industries are given time to learn ([[learning by doing]]) and upgrade. Once competitive enough, these restrictions are lifted to expose the selected industries to the international market.{{sfn|Gereffi|Wyman|1990}}

== History ==
The traditional arguments for industrial policies go back as far as the 18th century. Prominent early arguments in favor of selective protection of industries were contained in the 1791 ''[[Report on the Subject of Manufactures]]''{{sfn|Hamilton|1827}} of US economist and politician [[Alexander Hamilton]], as well as the work of German economist [[Friedrich List]].{{sfn|List|1909}} List's views on [[free trade]] were in explicit contradiction to those of Adam Smith,{{sfn|List|1909|loc=Book III, [http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/List/lstNPE31.html#Book%20III,%20Chapter%2031 Chapter 31: The System of Values of Exchange (Falsely Termed by the School, the 'Industrial' System)—Adam Smith]}} who, in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', said that "the most advantageous method in which a landed nation can raise up artificers, manufacturers, and merchants of its own is to grant the most perfect freedom of trade to the artificers, manufacturers, and merchants of all other nations."{{sfn|Smith|1904|loc=Book IV, [http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN19.html#IV.9.24 Chapter 9, para. 24]}} The arguments of List and others were subsequently picked up by scholars of early [[development economics]] such as [[Albert Hirschman]] and [[Alexander Gerschenkron]], who called for the selective promotion of ''key sectors'' in overcoming economic backwardness.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The relationship between government and industry in the United States has never been a simple one, and the labels used in categorizing these relationships at different times are often misleading if not false. In the early nineteenth century, for example, "it is quite clear that the laissez faire label is an inappropriate one."{{sfn|Prince|Taylor|1982|p=283}} In the US, an industrial policy was explicitly presented for the first time by the [[Jimmy Carter]] administration in August 1980, but it was subsequently dismantled with the election of [[Ronald Reagan]] the following year.{{sfn|Graham|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=My9sL1iKQm8C&amp;pg=PA27 27]}}

Historically, there is a growing consensus that most developed countries, including United Kingdom, United States, Germany, and France, have intervened actively in their domestic economy through industrial policies.{{sfn|Chang|2002}} These early examples are followed by interventionist [[Import substitution industrialization|ISI]] strategies pursued in Latin American countries such as Brazil, Mexico or Argentina.{{sfn|Gereffi|Wyman|1990}} More recently, the rapid growth of East Asian economies, or the [[newly industrialized countries]] ([[Newly industrialized country|NICs]]), has also been associated with active industrial policies that selectively promoted manufacturing and facilitated technology transfer and industrial upgrading.{{sfn|Wade|2003}} The success of these state-directed industrialization strategies are often attributed to [[developmental state]]s and strong bureaucracies such as the Japanese [[MITI]].{{sfn|Johnson|1982}} According to [[Princeton University|Princeton]]'s [[Atul Kohli]], the reason Japanese colonies such as [[Korea under Japanese rule|South Korea]] developed so rapidly and successfully was down to Japan exporting to its colonies the same centralised state development that it had used to develop itself.{{sfn|Kohli|2004}} Precisely speaking, South Korea's development can be explained by the fact that it followed the similar industrial policies that UK, US and Germany implemented, and South Korea adopted Export-Oriented Industrialization (EOI) policy from 1964 based on its own decision contrary to the Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) policy touted by international aid organizations and experts at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Koh 2018, pp. 28–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these domestic policy choices, however, are now seen as detrimental to free trade and are hence limited by various international agreements such as [[WTO]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures|TRIMs]] or [[TRIPS]]. Instead, the recent focus for industrial policy has shifted towards the promotion of local [[business cluster]]s and the integration into global [[value chain]]s.{{sfn|Humphrey|Schmitz|2000}}

During the [[Reagan administration]], an economic development initiative called [[Project Socrates]] was initiated to address US decline in ability to compete in world markets.  Project Socrates, directed by Michael Sekora, resulted in a computer-based competitive strategy system that was made available to private industry and all other public and private institutions that impact economic growth, competitiveness and trade policy.  A key objective of Socrates was to utilize advanced technology to enable US private institutions and public agencies to cooperate in the development and execution of competitive strategies without violating existing laws or compromising the spirit of "[[free market]]".   President Reagan was satisfied that this objective was fulfilled in the Socrates system.  Through the advances of innovation age technology, Socrates would provide "voluntary" but "systematic" coordination of resources across multiple "economic system" institutions including industry clusters, financial service organizations, university research facilities and government economic planning agencies.  While the view of one US President and the Socrates team was that technology made it virtually possible for both to exist simultaneously, the industrial policy vs. free market debate continued as later under the [[George H. W. Bush administration]], Socrates was labeled as industrial policy and de-funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Esther | last = Smith | title = DoD Unveils Competitive Tool: Project Socrates Offers Valuable Analysis | date = 5 May 1988 | work = Washington Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Markoff |first= John |date= 10 May 1990 |title= Technology Official Quits At Pentagon |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/10/business/technology-official-quits-at-pentagon.html |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate= 25 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|Financial Crisis of 2007–08]], many countries around the world  – including the US, UK, Australia, Japan and most countries of the European Union – have adopted industry policies. However contemporary industry policy generally accepts globalisation as a given, and focuses less on the decline of older industries, and more on the growth of emergent industries. It often involves government working collaboratively with industry to respond to challenges and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wear|first1=Andrew|title=Industry policy emerges from globalisation resurgent and more important than ever|url=http://www.themandarin.com.au/74425-industry-policy-emerges-from-globalisation-resurgent/|website=The Mandarin|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; China is a prominent case where the central and subnational governments intervene in nearly all economic sectors and processes. Even though market mechanisms have gained in importance, the state control prevails. In order to catch-up and even overtake industrialised countries technologically, China's "state activities even extend to efforts to prevent the dominance of foreign investors and technologies in areas considered to be of key significance such as the strategic industries and the new technologies"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Heilmann |first= Sebastian (ed.)|year= 2017 |title= China's Political System|p=240|url= https://www.merics.org/en/merics-analysis/chinas-political-system/ |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield }}&lt;/ref&gt; including robotics and new energy vehicles.

== Criticism ==
The main criticism against industrial policy arises from the concept of [[government failure]]. Industrial policy is seen as harmful as governments lack the required information, capabilities and incentives to successfully determine whether the benefits of promoting certain sectors above others exceeds the costs and in turn implement the policies.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance, regarding the medias industries: Violaine Hacker, « Citoyenneté culturelle et politique européenne des médias : entre compétitivité et promotion des valeurs », Nations, Cultures et Entreprises en Europe, sous la direction de Gilles Rouet, Collection Local et Global, L’Harmattan, Paris, pp. 163–84&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[East Asian Tigers]] provided successful examples of [[heterodox]] interventions and [[protectionist]] industrial policies,{{sfn|Amsden|1992}} industrial policies such as import-substitution-industrialization ([[Import substitution industrialization|ISI]]) have failed in many other regions such as Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. Governments, in making decisions with regard to electoral or personal incentives, can be captured by vested interests, leading to industrial policies supporting local [[rent-seeking]] political elites while distorting the efficient allocation of resources by market forces.{{sfn|Pack|Saggi|2006}}

== Debates on the 'how to' of IP ==
Despite criticism, there is a consensus in recent development theory that says state interventions may be necessary when [[market failure]]s occur.{{sfn|Rodrik|2009}} Market failures often exist in the form of [[externalities]] and [[natural monopolies]]. Such market failures maybhinder the emergence of a well-functioning market and corrective industrial policies{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} are required to ensure the allocative efficiency of a free market. Even relatively sceptical economists now recognise that public action can boost certain development factors "beyond what market forces on their own would generate."{{sfn|Rodrik|2004|p=1. "Perhaps not surprisingly, this recognition is now particularly evident in those parts of the world where market-oriented reforms were taken the farthest and the disappointment about the outcomes is correspondingly the greatest – notably in Latin America" }} In practice, these interventions are often aimed at regulating networks, public [[infrastructure]], [[R&amp;D]] or correcting [[information asymmetries]]. While the current debate has shifted away from dismissing industrial policies overall, the best ways of promoting industrial policy are still widely debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Five Major Debates on Industrial Policy |url= http://www.enterprise-development.org/page/industrial-policy#Debates |publisher= The Donor Committee for Enterprise Development |accessdate= 25 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One question is which kinds of industrial policy are most effective in promoting economic development. For example, economists debate whether developing countries should focus on their comparative advantage by promoting mostly resource- and labour-intensive products and services, or invest in higher-productivity industries, which may only become competitive in the longer term.{{sfn|Lin|Chang|2009}}

Debate also surrounds the issue whether government failures are more pervasive and severe than market failures.{{sfn|Khan|2003}} Some argue that the lower the government accountability and capabilities, the higher the risk of political capture of industrial policies, which may be economically more harmful than existing market failures.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Krause|2009}}

Of particular relevance for developing countries are the conditions under which industrial policies may also contribute to poverty reduction, such as a focus on specific industries or the promotion of linkages between larger companies and smaller local enterprises.{{sfn|Altenburg|2011}}

The '''Kehilla''' (pl. ''Kehillot'') is the local Jewish communal structure that was reinstated in the early twentieth century as a modern, secular, and religious sequel of the [[Qahal]] in Central and Eastern Europe, more particularly in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland's Second Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], during the interwar period (1918–1940), in application of the [[national personal autonomy]].

Unlike the ancient Qahal/Kehilla, abolished in the Russian Empire by Tsar Nicholas I in 1844,&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Abramson]], [http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/sympo/02summer/pdf2/abramson_large.pdf The end of intimate insularity: new narratives of Jewish history in the post-Soviet era], in Acts of Symposium “Construction and Deconstruction of National Histories in Slavic Eurasia,” at Sapporo, Japan, on July 10–13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; the modern Kehilla council was elected like a municipal council, with lists of candidates presented by the various Jewish parties: [[Agudat Yisrael]], the [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|religious]] and non religious [[Zionism|Zionists]], but also the marxist [[Bundism|Bundists]] and [[Poale Zion|Poalists]], the liberal-minded secularist [[Folkspartei|Folkists]], etc.

The initial project, as submitted by the Jewish delegations to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference in 1919]], was to constitute a National Jewish Council for each state, out of representatives from the various kehilla councils, like the former [[Council of Four Lands]].&lt;ref name="stopnicka"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stopnicka Heller|first=Celia|title=On the edge of destruction: Jews of Poland between the two World Wars|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1993|pages=383|isbn=978-0-8143-2494-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GmVt-O3AR34C&amp;pg=PA162|accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gitelman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gitelman|first=Zvi Y.|title=The emergence of modern Jewish politics: Bundism and Zionism in Eastern Europe|publisher=Univ of Pittsburgh Press|year=2003|pages=275|isbn=978-0-8229-4188-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jXNbzsp0XY8C&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Kehilla during the interwar Lithuanian Republic==
On March 4, 1920, a Law on kehillot was published in Lithuania, in which the kehilla was defined as a body recognized by public law with the right to impose taxes and to issue ordinances dealing with religious matters, education and philanthropy.&lt;ref name="gitelman"/&gt;

==The Warsaw Kehilla during the Second Polish Republic==
&lt;!--===During the Russian Empire===
*From 1871 to 1896, the president of the [[Warsaw]] kehilla was the assimilationist Ludvik Natanson.&lt;ref name="stopnicka"/&gt; --&gt;

In 1924, the [[Agudat Yisrael|Agudist]] candidate, [[Eliahu Kirshbraun]], was elected as president and [[Jacob Trokenheim]], another Agudist, as vice-president. The only other candidate for presidency was the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|Bundist]] [[Henryk Ehrlich]]. Finally, the kehilla executive reflected the composition of the council: 7 Orthodox, 6 Zionists, 1 Folkist, 1 Bundist. The Bund boycotted the 1931 elections in protest over the introduction by the Polish government, in order to favour its Agudist allies, of a “paragraph 20” in the Kehillot regulations which provided the Kehilla electoral commission with the possibility to reject a number of Agudat's opponents who were in their opinion not religious enough. In 1936, the Bund had now 15 seats out of 50 and Ehrlich was again candidate to the presidency, he got 16 votes, the [[Zionism|Zionist]] candidate Yitshak Schipper 10, and the Agudist Jacob Trokenheim won by a plurality of 19 votes.&lt;ref name="bacon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bacon|first=Gershon C.|title=The politics of tradition.

The '''Ku Klux Klan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|uː|_|ˈ|k|l|ʌ|k|s|_|ˈ|k|l|æ|n|,_|ˈ|k|j|uː}}),{{Efn|Commonly mispronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|uː|_|ˈ|k|l|ʌ|k|s|_|ˈ|k|l|æ|n}}.}} commonly called the '''KKK''' or simply the '''Klan''' and commonly misspelled as the '''Klu Klux Klan''', refers to three distinct secret movements at different points in time in the history of the [[United States]]. Each has advocated [[Extremism|extremist]] [[reactionary]] positions such as [[white supremacy]], [[white nationalism]], [[Nativism (politics)|anti-immigration]] and—especially in later iterations—[[Nordic race#Nordicism|Nordicism]]&lt;ref name="petersen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petersen|first1=William|title=Against the Stream: Reflections of an Unconventional Demographer|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FHlTJ6HbY50C&amp;dq=klu+klux+klan+nordicism|access-date=May 8, 2016|isbn=9781412816663}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guterl"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pratt Guterl|first1=Matthew|title=The Color of Race in America, 1900-1940|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CkF66YfhblwC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=klu+klux+klan+nordicism#v=onepage&amp;q=klu%20klux%20klan%20nordicism&amp;f=false|isbn=9780674038059}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[anti-Catholicism]].  Historically, the KKK used [[terrorism]]—both physical assault and murder—against groups or individuals whom they opposed.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, Patrick (Editor), 2006. ''Ku Klux Klan America's First Terrorists Exposed'', p. 210. {{ISBN|1-4196-4978-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All three movements have called for the "purification" of [[Society of the United States|American society]] and all are considered [[Far-right politics|right-wing extremist]] organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Rory McVeigh, ''The Rise of the Ku Klux Klan: Right-Wing Movements and National Politics'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew N.

''The Ku Klux Klan and Related American Racialist and Antisemitic Organizations: A History and Analysis'', p. 100. McFarland.&lt;/ref&gt;  In each era, membership was secret and estimates of the total were highly exaggerated by both friends and enemies.

The first Klan flourished in the [[Southern United States]] in the late 1860s, then died out by the early 1870s. It sought to overthrow the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] state governments in the South during the [[Reconstruction Era]], especially by using violence against [[African Americans|African-American]] leaders. With numerous autonomous chapters across the South, it was suppressed around 1871, through [[Third Enforcement Act|federal law enforcement]]. Members made their own, often colorful, costumes: robes, masks and [[Pointed hat|conical hats]], designed to be terrifying and to hide their identities.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Klanwatch Project (2011), illustrations, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Frantz Parsons, "Midnight Rangers: Costume and Performance in the Reconstruction-Era Ku Klux Klan". ''Journal of American History'' 92.3 (2005): 811–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second group was founded in the South in 1915 and it flourished nationwide in the early and mid-1920s, including urban areas of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Western United States|West]]. Taking inspiration from [[D. W. Griffith]]'s 1915 silent film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'', which mythologized the founding of the first Klan, it employed marketing techniques and a [[Golden age of fraternalism|popular fraternal organization structure]]. Rooted in local Protestant communities, it sought to maintain [[white supremacy]], often took a pro-[[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] stance, and it opposed [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and [[Jews]], while also stressing its opposition to the [[Catholic Church]] at a time of high emigration from the mostly Catholic nations of [[Central Europe]] and [[Southern Europe]].&lt;ref name="Kelly Baker 2011" /&gt; This second organization was funded by selling its members a standard white costume. It used K-words which were similar to those used by the first Klan, while adding [[cross burning]]s and mass parades to intimidate others. It rapidly declined in the later half of the 1920s.

The third and current manifestation of the KKK emerged after 1950, in the form of localized and isolated groups that use the KKK name. They have focused on opposition to the [[civil rights movement]], often using violence and murder to suppress activists. It is classified as a [[hate group]] by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].&lt;ref&gt;Both the [http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/ Anti-Defamation League] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003050902/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/ |date=October 3, 2012 }} and the [http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/ku-klux-klan/ Southern Poverty Law Center] include it in their lists of hate groups.

==Overview: Three Klans==
===First KKK===
{{See also|Nathan Bedford Forrest#Ku Klux Klan membership}}
The first Klan was founded in [[Pulaski, Tennessee]], sometime between December 1865 and August 1866 by six former officers of the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/history.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=4&amp;item=kkk |title=Ku Klux Klan&amp;nbsp;– Extremism in America |publisher=Anti-Defamation League |access-date=February 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212043142/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/history.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=4&amp;item=kkk |archivedate=February 12, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  as a fraternal social club inspired at least in part by the then largely defunct [[Sons of Malta]]. It borrowed parts of the initiation ceremony from that group, with the same purpose: "ludicrous initiations, the baffling of public curiosity, and the amusement for members were the only objects of the Klan," according to Albert Stevens in 1907.&lt;ref name="Stevens, Albert C. 1907"&gt;Stevens, Albert C.

The manual of rituals was printed by Laps D. McCord of Pulaski.&lt;ref name="dixonsomeofitsleaderstennessean"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dixon|first1=Thomas Jr.|title=The Ku Klux Klan: Some of Its Leaders|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/119491892/?terms=%22John%2BW.%2BMorton%22%2B%22ku%2Bklux%2Bklan%22|access-date=September 28, 2016|work=The Tennessean|date=August 27, 1905|via=[[Ancestry.com#Newspapers.com|Newspapers.com]]|registration=yes|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Cyclopædia of Fraternities'' (1907), "Beginning in April, 1867, there was a gradual transformation&amp;nbsp;... The members had conjured up a veritable Frankenstein. They had played with an engine of power and mystery, though organized on entirely innocent lines, and found themselves overcome by a belief that something must lie behind it all&amp;nbsp;— that there was, after all, a serious purpose, a work for the Klan to do."&lt;ref name="Stevens, Albert C. 1907" /&gt;

Although there was little organizational structure above the local level, similar groups rose across the South and adopted the same name and methods{{clarify|date=March 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;Trelease, ''White Terror'' (1971), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Klan groups spread throughout the South as an [[Insurgency|insurgent]] movement promoting resistance and [[white supremacy]] during the [[Reconstruction Era]]. For example, Confederate veteran [[John W. Morton (Tennessee politician)|John W. Morton]] founded a chapter in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="tennesseanobit"&gt;{{cite news|title=John W.

In 1870 and 1871, the federal government passed the [[Enforcement Acts]], which were intended to prosecute and suppress Klan crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wormser|first=Richard|title=The Enforcement Acts (1870-71)|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_enforce.html|publisher=PBS: Jim Crow Stories|access-date=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Klan had mixed results in terms of achieving its objectives. It seriously weakened the black political establishment through its use of assassinations and threats of violence; it drove some people out of politics. On the other hand, it caused a sharp backlash, with passage of federal laws that historian [[Eric Foner]] says were a success in terms of "restoring order, reinvigorating the morale of Southern Republicans, and enabling blacks to exercise their rights as citizens".&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ''Reconstruction '' (1988) p 458&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[George C. Rable]] argues that the Klan was a political failure and therefore was discarded by the Democratic leaders of the South. He says:

{{quote|the Klan declined in strength in part because of internal weaknesses; its lack of central organization and the failure of its leaders to control criminal elements and sadists. More fundamentally, it declined because it failed to achieve its central objective – the overthrow of Republican state governments in the South.&lt;ref&gt;George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'' (2007) pp. 101, 110–11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the Klan was suppressed, similar insurgent [[paramilitary]] groups arose that were explicitly directed at suppressing Republican voting and turning Republicans out of office: the [[White League]], which started in Louisiana in 1874; and the [[Red Shirts (United States)|Red Shirts]], which started in Mississippi and developed chapters in the Carolinas. For instance, the Red Shirts are credited with helping elect [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] as governor in South Carolina. They were described as acting as the military arm of the Democratic Party and are attributed with helping white Democrats regain control of state legislatures throughout the South.&lt;ref&gt;George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there were thousands of Confederate veterans in what were called rifle clubs.

===Second KKK===
{{See also|Ku Klux Klan in Canada}}
[[File:KKK night rally in Chicago c1920 cph.3b12355.jpg|thumb|KKK night rally in Chicago, c. 1920]]
In 1915, the second Klan was founded atop [[Stone Mountain]], Georgia by [[William Joseph Simmons]]. While Simmons relied on documents from the original Klan and memories of some surviving elders, the revived Klan was based significantly on the wildly popular film, ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''. The earlier Klan had not worn the white costumes or burned crosses; these were aspects introduced in the film. When the film was shown in Atlanta in December of that year, Simmons and his new klansmen paraded to the theater in robes and pointed hoods – many on robed horses – just like in the movie. These mass parades would become another hallmark of the new Klan that had not existed in the original Reconstruction-era organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A 1905 Silent Movie Revolutionizes American Film—and Radicalizes American Nationalists|publisher=Southern Hollows podcast|url=http://www.southernhollows.com/episodes/birthofanation|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1921, it adopted a modern business system of using full-time paid recruiters and appealed to new members as a fraternal organization, of which many examples were [[Golden age of fraternalism|flourishing]] at the time. The national headquarters made its profit through a monopoly of costume sales, while the organizers were paid through initiation fees. It grew rapidly nationwide at a time of prosperity. Reflecting the social tensions pitting urban versus rural America, it spread to every state and was prominent in many cities. The second KKK preached "One Hundred Percent Americanism" and demanded the purification of politics, calling for strict morality and better enforcement of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. Its official rhetoric focused on the threat of the [[Catholic Church]], using [[Anti-Catholicism in the United States|anti-Catholicism]] and [[nativism (politics)|nativism]].&lt;ref name=pegram&gt;Thomas R. Pegram, ''One Hundred Percent American: The Rebirth and Decline of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s'' (2011), pp. 47–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Its appeal was directed exclusively at white Protestants; it opposed Jews, blacks, Catholics, and newly arriving Southern European immigrants such as [[Italians]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly J. Baker, ''Gospel According to the Klan: The KKK's Appeal to Protestant America, 1915–1930'' (2011), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Some local groups threatened violence against rum runners and notorious sinners; the violent episodes generally took place in the South.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1992 ed., pp. 241–242.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Red Knights (organization)|Red Knights]] were a militant group organized in opposition to the KKK and responded violently to KKK provocations on several occasions.&lt;ref name=MacLean&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-509836-5| last = MacLean| first = Nancy| title = Behind the Mask of Chivalry: The Making of the Second Ku Klux Klan| date = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Klan was a formal [[fraternal and service organizations|fraternal organization]], with a national and state structure. During the resurgence of the second Klan during the 1920s, its publicity was handled by the [[Southern Publicity Association]]—within the first six months of the Associations national recruitment campaign, Klan membership had increased by 85,000.&lt;ref name=Blee&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-94292-9| last = Blee| first = Kathleen M.| title = Women of the Klan: Racism and Gender in the 1920s| date = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak in the mid-1920s, the organization claimed to include about 15% of the nation's eligible population, approximately 4–5 million men. Internal divisions, criminal behavior by leaders, and external opposition brought about a collapse in membership, which had dropped to about 30,000 by 1930. It finally faded away in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2730 |title=Ku Klux Klan in the Twentieth Century |author=Lay, Shawn |website=[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]] |publisher=[[Coker College]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Klan organizers also operated in Canada, especially in [[History of Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan]] in 1926–28, where Klansmen denounced immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]] as a threat to Canada's British heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Sher, ''White Hoods: Canada's Ku Klux Klan'' (1983), pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James M. Pitsula, ''Keeping Canada British: The Ku Klux Klan in 1920s Saskatchewan'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third KKK===
The "Ku Klux Klan" name was used by numerous independent local groups opposing the [[civil rights movement]] and [[desegregation]], especially in the 1950s and 1960s. During this period, they often forged alliances with Southern police departments, as in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]; or with governor's offices, as with [[George Wallace]] of Alabama.&lt;ref name="McWhorter"&gt;McWhorter 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of KKK groups were convicted of murder in the deaths of civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964 and children in the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham]] in 1963.

As of 2016, researchers estimate that there are just over 30 active Klan groups exist in the United States,&lt;ref name="TatteredRobes"&gt;''[https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/combating-hate/tattered-robes-state-of-kkk-2016.pdf Tattered Robes: The State of the Ku Klux Klan in the United States]'', Anti-Defamation League (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; with about 130 chapters.&lt;ref name="SPLCKlan"&gt;[https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/ku-klux-klan Extremist Files: Ku Klux Klan], Southern Poverty Law Center (last accessed October 21, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of total collective membership range from about 3,000&lt;ref name="TatteredRobes" /&gt; to between 5,000–8,000.&lt;ref name="SPLCKlan" /&gt; In addition to its active membership, the Klan has an "unknown number of associates and supporters."&lt;ref name="TatteredRobes" /&gt;

Today, many sources classify the Klan as a "subversive or terrorist organization".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/default.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=4&amp;item=kkk |title=About the Ku Klux Klan |publisher=Anti-Defamation League |access-date=January 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226085812/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/default.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=4&amp;item=kkk |archivedate=December 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Virginia Tech"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/16/us/inquiry-begun-on-klan-ties-of-2-icons-at-virginia-tech.html|title=Inquiry Begun on Klan Ties Of 2 Icons at Virginia Tech|date=November 16, 1997|work=New York Times|page=138|access-date=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee, Jennifer"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/06/us/06bowers.html|title=Samuel Bowers, 82, Klan Leader Convicted in Fatal Bombing, Dies |last=Lee|first=Jennifer|date=November 6, 2006|work=New York Times|access-date=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brush, Pete"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/05/28/supremecourt/main510317.shtml|title=Court Will Review Cross Burning Ban|last=Brush|first=Pete|date=May 28, 2002|publisher=CBS News|access-date=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1997, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents arrested four members of the True Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Dallas for conspiracy to commit robbery and for conspiring to blow up a natural gas processing plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dallas.fbi.gov/history.htm Dallas.FBI.gov "Domestic terrorism by the Klan remained a key concern"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305075543/http://dallas.fbi.gov/history.htm |date=March 5, 2010 }}, FBI, Dallas office&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the city council of [[Charleston, South Carolina]] passed a resolution declaring the Klan a terrorist organization.&lt;ref name="Charleston"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c0wPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=J4YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6460,2081194&amp;dq=klan+terrorist-organization&amp;hl=en|title=Klan named terrorist organization in Charleston|date=October 14, 1999|publisher=Reuters|access-date=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a professor at the [[University of Louisville]] began a campaign to have the Klan declared a terrorist organization in order to ban it from campus.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5030023|title=Ban the Klan?

University Alabama Press.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Six [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] veterans from [[Pulaski, Tennessee]] created the original Ku Klux Klan on December 24, 1865, during the [[Reconstruction Era in the United States|Reconstruction]] of the South after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Horn 1939, p. 9. The founders were John C. Lester, John B. Kennedy, James R. Crowe, Frank O. McCord, Richard R. Reed, and J. Calvin Jones.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Walter J., ''Ku Klux Klan: Its Origins, Growth and Disbandment'', p. 27, 1905, Neale Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The name was formed by combining the Greek ''{{lang|grc-Latn|[[kyklos]]}}'' (''κύκλος'', ''circle'') with ''[[clan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Horn 1939, p. 11, states that Reed proposed ''{{lang|grc|κύκλος}}'' (''{{lang|grc-Latn|kyklos}}'') and Kennedy added ''clan''. Wade 1987, p. 33 says that Kennedy came up with both words, but Crowe suggested transforming ''{{lang|grc|κύκλος}}'' into ''{{lang|grc-Latn|kuklux}}''.&lt;/ref&gt; The group was known for a short time as the "Kuklux Clan". The Ku Klux Klan was one of a number of secret, oath-bound organizations using violence, which included the Southern Cross in [[New Orleans]] (1865) and the [[Knights of the White Camelia]] (1867) in [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;W. E. B. Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America: 1860–1880'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1935; reprint, The Free Press, 1998, pp. 679–680.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians generally classify the KKK as part of the post-Civil War [[insurgent]] violence related not only to the high number of veterans in the population, but also to their effort to control the dramatically changed social situation by using extrajudicial means to restore white supremacy. In 1866, Mississippi Governor [[William L. Sharkey]] reported that disorder, lack of control, and lawlessness were widespread; in some states armed bands of Confederate soldiers roamed at will. The Klan used public violence against black people and their allies as intimidation. They burned houses and attacked and killed [[black people]], leaving their bodies on the roads.&lt;ref&gt;W.E.B. Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America: 1860–1880'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1935; reprint, The Free Press, 1998, p. 671–675.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anti-kkk-cartoon.jpg|thumb|A political cartoon depicting the KKK and the Democratic Party as continuations of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]]]
At an 1867 meeting in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], Klan members gathered to try to create a hierarchical organization with local chapters eventually reporting to a national headquarters. Since most of the Klan's members were veterans, they were used to such military hierarchy, but the Klan never operated under this centralized structure. Local chapters and bands were highly independent.
[[File:NathanBedfordForrest.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]]]

Former Confederate Brigadier General [[George Gordon (Civil War General)|George Gordon]] developed the ''Prescript'', which espoused white supremacist belief. For instance, an applicant should be asked if he was in favor of "a white man's government," "the reenfranchisement and emancipation of the white men of the South, and the restitution of the Southern people to all their rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albany.edu/faculty/gz580/his101/kkk.html |title=Ku Klux Klan, Organization and Principles, 1868 |publisher=[[State University of New York at Albany]] |access-date=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is a reference to the [[Ironclad Oath]], which stripped the vote from white persons who refused to swear that they had not borne arms against the Union.

Confederate General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] was elected the first [[Grand Wizard]], and claimed to be the Klan's national leader.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Battle from the Start: The Life of Nathan Bedford Forrest |last=Wills |first=Brian Steel |year=1992 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |location=New York, New York|page=336|isbn=978-0-06-092445-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an 1868 newspaper interview, Forrest stated that the Klan's primary opposition was to the [[Loyal Leagues]], [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] state governments, people such as Tennessee governor [[William Gannaway Brownlow]], and other "[[carpetbagger]]s" and "[[scalawag]]s".&lt;ref&gt;''The Sun''. "Civil War Threatened in Tennessee." September 3, 1868: 2; ''The Charleston Daily News''. "A Talk with General Forrest." September 8, 1868: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that many Southerners believed that blacks were voting for the Republican Party because they were being hoodwinked by the Loyal Leagues.&lt;ref&gt;Cincinnati ''Commercial'', August 28, 1868, quoted in Wade, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; One Alabama newspaper editor declared "The League is nothing more than a nigger Ku Klux Klan."&lt;ref&gt;Horn 1939, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Gordon's and Forrest's work, local Klan units never accepted the Prescript and continued to operate autonomously. There were never hierarchical levels or state headquarters. Klan members used violence to settle old personal feuds and local grudges, as they worked to restore general white dominance in the disrupted postwar society. The historian Elaine Frantz Parsons describes the membership:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lifting the Klan mask revealed a chaotic multitude of antiblack vigilante groups, disgruntled poor white farmers, wartime [[guerrilla]] bands, displaced Democratic politicians, illegal whiskey distillers, coercive moral reformers, sadists, rapists, white workmen fearful of black competition, employers trying to enforce labor discipline, common thieves, neighbors with decades-old grudges, and even a few freedmen and white Republicans who allied with Democratic whites or had criminal agendas of their own. Indeed, all they had in common, besides being overwhelmingly white, southern, and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], was that they called themselves, or were called, Klansmen.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons 2005, p. 816.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Wikisource|Interview with Nathan Bedford Forrest}}
Historian [[Eric Foner]] observed: "In effect, the Klan was a military force serving the interests of the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic party]], the [[planter class]], and all those who desired restoration of white supremacy. Its purposes were political, but political in the broadest sense, for it sought to affect power relations, both public and private, throughout Southern society. It aimed to reverse the interlocking changes sweeping over the South during Reconstruction: to destroy the Republican party's infrastructure, undermine the Reconstruction state, reestablish control of the black labor force, and restore racial subordination in every aspect of Southern life.&lt;ref name="Foner425"&gt;Foner 1988, p. 425–426.&lt;/ref&gt; To that end they worked to curb the education, economic advancement, [[voting rights]], and [[right to keep and bear arms]] of blacks.&lt;ref name="Foner425" /&gt; The Klan soon spread into nearly every Southern state, launching a reign of terror against Republican leaders both black and white. Those political leaders assassinated during the campaign included Arkansas Congressman [[James M. Hinds]], three members of the South Carolina legislature, and several men who served in constitutional conventions".&lt;ref&gt;Foner 1988, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klan members adopted masks and robes that hid their identities and added to the drama of their night rides, their chosen time for attacks. Many of them operated in small towns and rural areas where people otherwise knew each other's faces, and sometimes still recognized the attackers by voice and mannerisms. "The kind of thing that men are afraid or ashamed to do openly, and by day, they accomplish secretly, masked, and at night."&lt;ref&gt;W.E.B. Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America: 1860–1880'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1935; reprint, The Free Press, 1998, pp. 677–678.&lt;/ref&gt; The KKK night riders "sometimes claimed to be ghosts of Confederate soldiers so, as they claimed, to frighten superstitious blacks. Few freedmen took such nonsense seriously."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877'' (1988) p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Klan attacked black members of the [[Union League|Loyal Leagues]] and intimidated Southern Republicans and [[Freedmen's Bureau]] workers. When they killed black political leaders, they also took heads of families, along with the leaders of churches and community groups, because these people had many roles in society. Agents of the Freedmen's Bureau reported weekly assaults and murders of blacks.

"Armed guerrilla warfare killed thousands of Negroes; political riots were staged; their causes or occasions were always obscure, their results always certain: ten to one hundred times as many Negroes were killed as whites." Masked men shot into houses and burned them, sometimes with the occupants still inside. They drove successful black farmers off their land. "Generally, it can be reported that in North and South Carolina, in 18 months ending in June 1867, there were 197 murders and 548 cases of aggravated assault."&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America: 1860–1880'' pp. 674–675.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George W. Ashburn.jpg|thumb|[[George W. Ashburn]] was assassinated for his pro-black sentiments.]]
Klan violence worked to suppress black voting, and campaign seasons were deadly. More than 2,000 people were killed, wounded, or otherwise injured in [[Louisiana]] within a few weeks prior to the Presidential election of November 1868. Although [[St. Landry Parish]] had a registered Republican majority of 1,071, after the murders, no Republicans voted in the fall elections. White Democrats cast the full vote of the parish for President Grant's opponent. The KKK killed and wounded more than 200 black Republicans, hunting and chasing them through the woods. Thirteen captives were taken from jail and shot; a half-buried pile of 25 bodies was found in the woods. The KKK made people vote Democratic and gave them certificates of the fact.&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America: 1860–1880'', pp.680–681.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the April 1868 [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] gubernatorial election, [[Columbia County, Georgia|Columbia County]] cast 1,222 votes for Republican [[Rufus Bullock]]. By the [[United States presidential election, 1868|November presidential election]], Klan intimidation led to suppression of the Republican vote and only one person voted for [[Ulysses S. Grant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-694 |title=Ku Klux Klan in the Reconstruction Era |author=Bryant, Jonathan M |website=[[The New Georgia Encyclopedia]] |publisher=[[Georgia Southern University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klansmen killed more than 150 African Americans in a county{{which|date=March 2018}} in [[Florida]], and hundreds more in other counties.{{which|date=March 2018}} Florida Freedmen's Bureau records provided a detailed recounting of Klansmen's beatings and murders of freedmen and their white allies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Newton, ''The Invisible Empire: The Ku Klux Klan in Florida'', pp. 1–30. Newton quotes from the ''Testimony Taken by the Joint Select Committee to Enquire into the Condition of Affairs in the Late Insurrectionary States'', Vol. 13. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1872. Among historians of the Klan, this volume is also known as ''The KKK testimony''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Milder encounters, including some against white teachers, also occurred. In [[Mississippi]], according to the Congressional inquiry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of these teachers (Miss Allen of Illinois), whose school was at Cotton Gin Port in [[Monroe County, Mississippi|Monroe County]], was visited ... between one and two o'clock in the morning on March 1871, by about fifty men mounted and disguised. Each man wore a long white robe and his face was covered by a loose mask with scarlet stripes. She was ordered to get up and dress which she did at once and then admitted to her room the captain and lieutenant who in addition to the usual disguise had long horns on their heads and a sort of device in front. The lieutenant had a pistol in his hand and he and the captain sat down while eight or ten men stood inside the door and the porch was full. They treated her "gentlemanly and quietly" but complained of the heavy school-tax, said she must stop teaching and go away and warned her that they never gave a second notice. She heeded the warning and left the county.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes 1920, pp. 157–158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1868, two years after the Klan's creation, its activity was beginning to decrease.&lt;ref name="Horn-p375"&gt;Horn 1939, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; Members were hiding behind Klan masks and robes as a way to avoid prosecution for freelance violence. Many influential Southern Democrats feared that Klan lawlessness provided an excuse for the federal government to retain its power over the South, and they began to turn against it.&lt;ref name="Wade-p102"&gt;Wade 1987, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; There were outlandish claims made, such as Georgian [[B. H. Hill]] stating "that some of these outrages were actually perpetrated by the political friends of the parties slain."&lt;ref name="Horn-p375" /&gt;

===Resistance===
{{Wikisource|Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871}}
Union Army veterans in mountainous [[Blount County, Alabama]] organized "the anti-Ku Klux". They put an end to violence by threatening Klansmen with reprisals unless they stopped whipping Unionists and burning black churches and schools. Armed blacks formed their own defense in [[Bennettsville, South Carolina]] and patrolled the streets to protect their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 1988, p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

National sentiment gathered to crack down on the Klan, even though some Democrats at the national level questioned whether the Klan really existed, or believed that it was a creation of nervous Southern Republican governors.&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Many southern states began to pass anti-Klan legislation.&lt;ref name=Ranney2006&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ranney|first1=Joseph A|title=In the Wake of Slavery: Civil War, Civil Rights, and the Reconstruction of Southern Law|date=Jan 1, 2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0275989729|pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1871, [[Pennsylvania]] Republican Senator [[John Scott (Pennsylvania)|John Scott]] convened a Congressional committee which took testimony from 52 witnesses about Klan atrocities, accumulating 12 volumes. In February, former Union General and Congressman [[Benjamin Butler|Benjamin Franklin Butler]] of Massachusetts introduced the [[Third Enforcement Act|Civil Rights Act of 1871]] (Ku Klux Klan Act). This added to the enmity that Southern white Democrats bore toward him.&lt;ref&gt;Horn 1939, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; While the bill was being considered, further violence in the South swung support for its passage. The [[Governor of South Carolina]] appealed for federal troops to assist his efforts in keeping control of the state. A [[Meridian race riot of 1871|riot and massacre]] occurred in a [[Meridian, Mississippi]] courthouse, from which a black state representative escaped by fleeing to the woods.&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1987, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1871 Civil Rights Act allowed the President to suspend ''[[habeas corpus]].''&lt;ref name="Scaturro"&gt;{{cite web|last=Scaturro |first=Frank |title=The Presidency of Ulysses S.

In 1871, President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] signed Butler's legislation. The Ku Klux Klan Act and the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]] were used by the federal government to enforce the civil rights provisions for individuals under the constitution. The Klan refused to voluntarily dissolve after the 1871 Klan Act, so President Grant issued a suspension of ''habeas corpus'' and stationed federal troops in nine South Carolina counties. The Klansmen were apprehended and prosecuted in federal court. Judges [[Hugh Lennox Bond]] and George S. Bryan presided over the trial of KKK members in Columbia, South Carolina during December 1871.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, United States Circuit Court (4th Circuit).

===End of the first Klan===
Klan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest boasted that the Klan was a nationwide organization of 550,000 men and that he could muster 40,000 Klansmen within five days notice. However, the Klan had no membership rosters, no chapters, and no local officers, so it was difficult for observers to judge its membership.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''. "N. B. Forrest." September 3, 1868.&lt;/ref&gt; It had created a sensation by the dramatic nature of its masked forays and because of its many murders.

In 1870, a federal grand jury determined that the Klan was a "[[terrorist]] organization"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isbn.nu/toc/9780807119532 |title=''White Terror: The Ku Klux Klan Conspiracy and Southern Reconstruction'' by Allen W. Trelease (Louisiana State University Press: 1995) }}&lt;/ref&gt; and issued hundreds of indictments for crimes of violence and terrorism. Klan members were prosecuted, and many fled from areas that were under federal government jurisdiction, particularly in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Trelease 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people not formally inducted into the Klan had used the Klan's costume to hide their identities when carrying out independent acts of violence. Forrest called for the Klan to disband in 1869, arguing that it was "being perverted from its original honorable and patriotic purposes, becoming injurious instead of subservient to the public peace".&lt;ref&gt;Quotes from Wade 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Stanley Horn]] argues that "generally speaking, the Klan's end was more in the form of spotty, slow, and gradual disintegration than a formal and decisive disbandment".&lt;ref&gt;Horn 1939, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; A Georgia-based reporter wrote in 1870: "A true statement of the case is not that the Ku Klux are an organized band of licensed criminals, but that men who commit crimes call themselves Ku Klux".&lt;ref&gt;Horn 1939, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NCG-WilliamHolden.jpg|thumb|upright|Gov. [[William Woods Holden|William Holden]] of North Carolina.]]
In many states, officials were reluctant to use black militia against the Klan out of fear that racial tensions would be raised.&lt;ref name="jimcrow-stories"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_enforce.html |title=The Rise and Fall of Jim Crow—The Enforcement Acts (1870–1871) |author=Wormser, Richard |website= |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |access-date=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican [[Governor of North Carolina]] [[William Woods Holden]] called out the militia against the Klan in 1870, adding to his unpopularity. This and extensive violence and fraud at the polls caused the Republicans to lose their majority in the state legislature. Disaffection with Holden's actions contributed to white Democratic legislators impeaching him and removing him from office, but their reasons for doing so were numerous.&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1987, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klan operations ended in South Carolina&lt;ref&gt;Wade, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; and gradually withered away throughout the rest of the South. Attorney General [[Amos Tappan Ackerman]] led the prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1987, p. 109, writes that by 1874, "For many, the lapse of the enforcement acts was justified since their reason for being—the Ku-Klux Klan—had been effectively smashed as a result of the dramatic showdown in South Carolina".&lt;/ref&gt;

Foner argues that:

{{quote|By 1872, the federal government's evident willingness to bring its legal and coercive authority to bear had broken the Klan's back and produced a dramatic decline in violence throughout the South. So ended the Reconstruction career of the Ku Klux Klan.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ''Reconstruction'' (1988) p. 458–459.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

New groups of insurgents emerged in the mid-1870s, local paramilitary organizations such as the [[White League]], [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], saber clubs, and rifle clubs, that intimidated and murdered black political leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1987, p. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt; The White League and Red Shirts were distinguished by their willingness to cultivate publicity, working directly to overturn Republican officeholders and regain control of politics.

In 1882, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[United States v. Harris]]'' that the Klan Act was partially [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. It ruled that Congress's power under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] did not include the right to regulate against private conspiracies. It recommended that persons who had been victimized should seek relief in state courts, which were entirely unsympathetic to such appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/opeds/historylesson1.pdf |format=PDF |title=History Lesson |author=Balkin, Jack M. |year=2002 |publisher=[[Yale University]] |access-date=February 27, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054220/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/opeds/historylesson1.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klan costumes, also called "[[Ku Klux Klan regalia and insignia|regalia]]", disappeared from use by the early 1870s,&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;109&lt;/ref&gt; after Grand Wizard Forrest called for their destruction as part of disbanding the Klan. The Klan was broken as an organization by 1872.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_enforce.html "The Rise and Fall of Jim Crow: The Enforcement Acts, 1870–1871", Public Broadcast Service].

==Second Klan: 1915–1944==

===Refounding in 1915===
In 1915 the film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' was released, mythologizing and glorifying the first Klan and its endeavors. The second Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1915 by [[William Joseph Simmons]] at [[Stone Mountain]], near Atlanta, with fifteen "charter members".&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Various Shady Lives of the Ku Klux Klan|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898581,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|quote=An itinerant Methodist preacher named William Joseph Simmons started up the Klan again in Atlanta in 1915. Simmons, an ascetic-looking man, was a fetishist on fraternal organizations. He was already a "colonel" in the [[Woodmen of the World]], but he decided to build an organization all his own. He was an effective speaker, with an affinity for alliteration; he had preached on "Women, Weddings and Wives," "Red Heads, Dead Heads and No Heads," and the "Kinship of Kourtship and Kissing." On Thanksgiving Eve 1915, Simmons took 15 friends to the top of Stone Mountain, near Atlanta, built an altar on which he placed an American flag, a Bible and an unsheathed sword, set fire to a crude wooden cross, muttered a few incantations about a "practical fraternity among men," and declared himself Imperial Wizard of the Invisible Empire of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.|date=April 9, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its growth was based on a new anti-immigrant, [[Anti-Catholicism in the United States|Anti-Catholic]], [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibitionist]] and [[anti-Semitic]] agenda, which reflected contemporary social tensions, particularly recent immigration. The new organization and chapters adopted regalia featured in ''The Birth of a Nation''; membership was kept secret by wearing masks in public.

====''The Birth of a Nation''====
[[File:Birth-of-a-nation-poster-color.jpg|thumb|Movie poster for ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''. It has been widely noted for inspiring the revival of the Ku Klux Klan.]]
Director [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''The Birth of a Nation'' glorified the original Klan. The film was based on the book and play ''[[The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan]]'', as well as the book ''[[The Leopard's Spots]]'', both by [[Thomas Dixon Jr.]] Much of the modern Klan's iconography is derived from it, including the standardized white costume and the [[Cross burning|lighted cross]]. Its imagery was based on Dixon's romanticized concept of old England and Scotland, as portrayed in the novels and poetry of Sir [[Walter Scott]].  The film's influence was enhanced by a false claim of endorsement by President [[Woodrow Wilson]].  Dixon was an old friend of Wilson's and, before its release, there was a private showing of the film at the [[White House]].  A publicist claimed that Wilson said, "It is like writing history with lightning, and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true." Wilson strongly disliked the film and felt he had been tricked by Dixon. The White House issued a denial of the "lightning" quote, saying that he was entirely unaware of the nature of the film and at no time had expressed his approbation of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Milton Cooper Jr.|title=Woodrow Wilson: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOZVsyO4K2cC&amp;pg=PA273|year=2011|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|pages=272–273|isbn=9780307277909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second Klan saw threats from every direction. According to historian Brian R. Farmer, "two-thirds of the national Klan lecturers were Protestant ministers".&lt;ref&gt;Brian R. Farmer, ''American Conservatism: History, Theory and Practice'' (2005), p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Klan's energy went into guarding the home, and historian Kathleen Blee says that its members wanted to protect "the interests of white womanhood".&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen M. Blee, ''Women of the Klan: Racism and Gender in the 1920s'' (2008), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Simmons published the pamphlet ''ABC of the Invisible Empire'' in Atlanta in 1917; in it, he identified the Klan's goals as "to shield the sanctity of the home and the chastity of womanhood; to maintain white supremacy; to teach and faithfully inculcate a high spiritual philosophy through an exalted ritualism; and by a practical devotedness to conserve, protect and maintain the distinctive institutions, rights, privileges, principles and ideals of a pure Americanism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McWhirter|first=Cameron|title=Red Summer: The Summer of 1919 and the Awakening of Black America|date=2011|publisher=Henry Holt and Company, LLC|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8050-8906-6|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such moral-sounding purpose underlay its appeal as a fraternal organization, recruiting members with a promise of aid in settling in the new urban societies of rapidly growing cities such as Dallas and Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Jackson, ''The Ku Klux Klan in the Cities''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organization===
New Klan founder [[William Joseph Simmons|William J. Simmons]] joined 12 different fraternal organizations and [[Ku Klux Klan recruitment|recruited for the Klan]] with his chest covered with fraternal badges, consciously modeling the Klan after fraternal organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898581,00.html |title=Nation: The Various Shady Lives of The Ku Klux Klan |work=TIME |date=April 9, 1965 |access-date=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klan organizers called "[[Kleagle]]s" signed up hundreds of new members, who paid initiation fees and received KKK costumes in return. The organizer kept half the money and sent the rest to state or national officials. When the organizer was done with an area, he organized a rally, often with burning crosses, and perhaps presented a Bible to a local Protestant preacher. He left town with the money collected. The local units operated like many fraternal organizations and occasionally brought in speakers.

Simmons initially met with little success in either recruiting members or in raising money, and the Klan remained a small operation in the Atlanta area until 1920. The group produced publications for national circulation from its headquarters in Atlanta: ''Searchlight'' (1919–24), ''Imperial Night-Hawk'' (1923–24), and ''The Kourier''.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1992 ed., p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ImperialNighthawkVol.1No.77|title=Imperial Nighthawk Vol. 1 No.8|first=|last=Knights of the Ku Klux Klan|date=January 1, 1923|publisher=Atlanta, Ga: Knights of the Ku Klux Klan|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/kourier/oclc/1755269|title=The Kourier|first=|last=Ku Klux Klan (1915- )|date=January 1, 1924|publisher=|via=Open WorldCat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceived moral threats===
The second Klan grew primarily in response to issues of declining morality typified by [[divorce]], [[adultery]], defiance of Prohibition, and criminal gangs in the news every day.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly J. Baker, ''Gospel According to the Klan: The KKK's Appeal to Protestant America, 1915–1930'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a response to the growing power of Catholics and [[American Jews]] and the accompanying proliferation of non-Protestant cultural values.  The Klan had a nationwide reach by the mid-1920s, with its densest per capita membership in [[Indiana]]. It became most prominent in cities with high growth rates between 1910 and 1930, as rural Protestants flocked to jobs in [[Detroit]] and [[Dayton]] in the Midwest, and [[Atlanta]], [[Dallas]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], and [[Houston]] in the South. Close to half of Michigan's 80,000 Klansmen lived in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1967, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the KKK swore to uphold American values and Christian morality, and some Protestant ministers became involved at the local level. However, no Protestant denomination officially endorsed the KKK;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth T. Jackson|title=The Ku Klux Klan in the City, 1915-1930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkgwSauBgTwC&amp;pg=PA18|date= 1992|publisher=Ivan R. Dee|page=18|isbn=9781461730057}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, the Klan was repeatedly denounced by the major Protestant magazines, as well as by all major secular newspapers. Historian Robert Moats Miller reports that "not a single endorsement of the Klan was found by the present writer in the Methodist press, while many of the attacks on the Klan were quite savage&amp;nbsp;... the Southern Baptist press condoned the aims but condemned the methods of the Klan." National denominational organizations never endorsed the Klan, but they rarely condemned it by name. Many nationally and regionally prominent churchmen did condemn it by name, and none endorsed it.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Moats Miller, "A Note on the Relationship between the Protestant Churches and the Revived Ku Klux Klan." ''Journal of Southern History'' (1956) pp: 355-368 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2954550 in JSTOR], quotes p 360, 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rapid growth===
In 1920 Simmons handed the day-to-day activities of the national office over to two professional publicists, [[Mary Elizabeth Tyler|Elizabeth Tyler]] and [[Edward Young Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Newton, ''The Ku Klux Klan in Mississippi: A History'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The new leadership invigorated the Klan and it grew rapidly. It appealed to new members based on current social tensions, and stressed responses to fears raised by defiance of Prohibition and new sexual freedoms. It emphasized [[History of antisemitism in the United States|anti-Jewish]], [[Anti-Catholicism in the United States|anti-Catholic]], [[anti-immigrant]] and later [[anti-communism|anti-Communist]] positions. It presented itself as a fraternal, nativist and strenuously patriotic organization; and its leaders emphasized support for vigorous enforcement of [[Prohibition]] laws. It expanded membership dramatically to a 1924 peak of 1.5 million to 4 million, which was between 4-15% of the eligible population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Hatred and Profits: Under the Hood of the Ku Klux Klan*|url = http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/127/4/1883|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date = November 1, 2012|issn = 0033-5533|pages = 1883–1925|volume = 127|issue = 4|doi = 10.1093/qje/qjs028|first = Roland G.|last = Fryer|first2 = Steven D.|last2 = Levitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1920s, most of its members lived in the Midwest and West. Nearly one in five of the eligible Indiana population were members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It had a national base by 1925. In the South, where the great majority of whites were Democrats, the Klansmen were Democrats. In the rest of the country, the membership comprised both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and Democrats, as well as [[Independent voter|independents]]. Klan leaders tried to infiltrate political parties; as Cummings notes, "it was non-partisan in the sense that it pressed its nativist issues to both parties."

{{quote|Klan leaders hope to have all major candidates competing to win the movement's endorsement. ... The Klan's leadership wanted to keep their options open and repeatedly announced that the movement was not aligned with any political party. This non-alliance strategy was also valuable as a recruiting tool. The Klan drew its members from Democratic as well as Republican voters. If the movement had aligned itself with a single political party, it would have substantially narrowed its pool of potential recruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen D. Cummings|title=Red States, Blue States, and the Coming Sharecropper Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4NNBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119|year=2008|page=119|access-date=February 27, 2016|isbn=9780875866277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Rory M. McVeigh|Rory McVeigh]] has explained the Klan's strategy in appealing to members of both parties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rory McVeigh|title=The Rise of the Ku Klux Klan: Right-wing Movements and National Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKerOfTH5hkC&amp;pg=PA184|year=2009|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|page=184|access-date=February 27, 2016|isbn=9780816656196}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Religion was a major selling point. Baker argues that Klansmen seriously embraced Protestantism as an essential component of their white supremacist, anti-Catholic, and paternalistic formulation of American democracy and national culture. Their cross was a religious symbol, and their ritual honored Bibles and local ministers. No nationally prominent religious leader said he was a Klan member.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly J. Baker, ''Gospel According to the Klan: The KKK's Appeal to Protestant America, 1915–1930'' (University Press of Kansas, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists Fryer and Levitt argue that the rapid growth of the Klan in the 1920s was partly the result of an innovative [[multi-level marketing]] campaign. They also argue that the Klan leadership focused more intently on monetizing the organization during this period than fulfilling the political goals of the organization. Local leaders profited from expanding their membership.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Prohibition====
Historians agree that the Klan's resurgence in the 1920s was aided by the national debate over Prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;Pegram, ''One Hundred Percent American'', pp. 119-56.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Prendergast says that the KKK's "support for [[Prohibition in the United States#National Prohibition|Prohibition]] represented the single most important bond between Klansmen throughout the nation".&lt;ref&gt;Prendergast 1987, pp. 25–52, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The Klan opposed bootleggers, sometimes with violence. In 1922, two hundred Klan members set fire to saloons in [[Union County, Arkansas]]. Membership in the Klan and in other Prohibition groups overlapped, and they sometimes coordinated activities.&lt;ref&gt;Barr 1999, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urbanization===
[[File:theendkkk.jpg|thumb|"The End" Referring to the end of Catholic influence in the US. ''[[Klansmen: Guardians of Liberty]]'' 1926]]
A significant characteristic of the second Klan was that it was an organization based in urban areas, reflecting the major shifts of population to cities in both the North and the South. In Michigan, for instance, 40,000 members lived in [[Detroit]], where they made up more than half of the state's membership. Most Klansmen were lower- to middle-class whites who were trying to protect their jobs and housing from the waves of newcomers to the industrial cities: immigrants from Southern Europe and Eastern Europe, who were mostly Catholic or Jewish; and black and white migrants from the South. As new populations poured into cities, rapidly changing neighborhoods created social tensions. Because of the rapid pace of population growth in industrializing cities such as Detroit and Chicago, the Klan grew rapidly in the Midwest. The Klan also grew in booming Southern cities such as Dallas and Houston.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;Jackson 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the medium-size industrial city of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in the 1920s, the Klan ascended to power quickly but declined as a result of opposition from the Catholic Church. There was no violence and the local newspaper ridiculed Klansmen as "night-shirt knights". Half of the members were [[Swedish Americans]], including some first-generation immigrants. The ethnic and religious conflicts among more recent immigrants contributed to the rise of the Klan in the city. Swedish Protestants were struggling against Irish Catholics, who had been entrenched longer, for political and ideological control of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Parker, "'Night-Shirt Knights' in the City: The Ku Klux Klan in 1920s Worcester, Massachusetts", ''New England Journal of History'', Fall 2009, Vol. 66 Issue 1, pp. 62–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some states, historians have obtained membership rosters of some local units and matched the names against city directory and local records to create statistical profiles of the membership. Big city newspapers were often hostile and ridiculed Klansmen as ignorant farmers. Detailed analysis from Indiana showed that the rural stereotype was false for that state:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Indiana's Klansmen represented a wide cross section of society: they were not disproportionately urban or rural, nor were they significantly more or less likely than other members of society to be from the working class, middle class, or professional ranks. Klansmen were [[Protestantism|Protestants]], of course, but they cannot be described exclusively or even predominantly as [[fundamentalism|fundamentalists]]. In reality, their religious affiliations mirrored the whole of white Protestant society, including those who did not belong to any church.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1991, p 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Klan attracted people but most of them did not remain in the organization for long. Membership in the Klan turned over rapidly as people found out that it was not the group which they had wanted. Millions joined, and at its peak in the 1920s, the organization claimed numbers that amounted to 15% of the nation's eligible population. The lessening of social tensions contributed to the Klan's decline.

===Costumes and the burning cross===
[[File:Ku Klux Klan members and a burning cross, Denver, Colorado, 1921.jpg|thumb|[[Cross burning]] was introduced by [[William Joseph Simmons|William J. Simmons]], the founder of the second Klan in 1915.]]
The distinctive white costume permitted large-scale public activities, especially parades and cross-burning ceremonies, while keeping the membership rolls a secret. Sales of the costumes provided the main financing for the national organization, while initiation fees funded local and state organizers.

The second Klan embraced the burning [[Latin cross]] as a dramatic display of symbolism, with a tone of intimidation.&lt;ref name="Greenhouse"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/29/us/supreme-court-roundup-free-speech-or-hate-speech-court-weighs-cross-burning.html?pagewanted=all|title=Supreme Court Roundup; Free Speech or Hate Speech?

Its lighting during meetings was often accompanied by prayer, the singing of [[hymn]]s, and other overtly religious symbolism.&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{cite book |title=The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America |last=Wade |first=Wyn Craig |year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA|page=185|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6O_XYBMhNYAC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=cross+burning+religious+kkk#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|access-date=May 3, 2011 |isbn=978-0-19-512357-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his novel ''The Clansman'', Thomas Dixon Jr. borrows the idea that the first Klan had used [[Crann Tara|fiery crosses]] from 'the call to arms' of the Scottish Clans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/z3xhhv4 |title=Were Scots responsible for the Ku Klux Klan? |last=Oliver |first=Neil |author-link=Neil Oliver |last2=Frantz Parsons |first2=Elaine |website=[[bbc.co.uk]]|access-date=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and film director D.W. Griffith used this image in ''The Birth of a Nation''; Simmons adopted the symbol wholesale from the movie, and the symbol and action have been associated with the Klan ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cecil Adams |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1038/why-does-the-ku-klux-klan-burn-crosses |title=Why does the Ku Klux Klan burn crosses? |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=June 18, 1993 |access-date=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===
By the 1920s, the KKK developed a women's auxiliary, with chapters in many areas. Its activities included participation in parades, cross lightings, lectures, rallies, and boycotts of local businesses owned by Catholics and Jews. The Women's Klan was active in promoting Prohibition, stressing liquor's negative impact on wives and children. Its efforts in public schools included distributing Bibles and petitioning for the dismissal of Roman Catholic teachers. As a result of the Women's Klan's efforts, Texas would not hire Catholic teachers to work in its public schools. As sexual and financial scandals rocked the Klan leadership late in the 1920s, the organization's popularity among both men and women dropped off sharply.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen M. Blee, ''Women of the Klan: Racism and Gender in the 1920s'' (University of California Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political role===
[[File:klan-sheet-music.jpg|thumb|left|Sheet music to "We Are All Loyal Klansmen", 1923]]
The members of the first Klan in the South were exclusively [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. The second Klan expanded with new chapters in cities in the Midwest and West, and reached both Republicans and Democrats, as well as men without a party affiliation.   The goal of Prohibition in particular helped the Klan and some Republicans to make common cause in the North.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R. Pegram, "Hoodwinked: The Anti-Saloon League and the Ku Klux Klan in 1920s Prohibition Enforcement." ''Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era'' 7.1 (2008): 89-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Klan had numerous members in every part of the United States, but was particularly strong in the South and Midwest. At its peak, claimed Klan membership exceeded four million and comprised 20% of the adult white male population in many broad geographic regions, and 40% in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;Marty Gitlin, ''The Ku Klux Klan: A Guide to an American Subculture'' (2009) p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Klan also moved north into Canada, especially [[Saskatchewan]], where it opposed Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Sher, ''White Hoods: Canada's Ku Klux Klan'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indiana, members were American-born, white Protestants and covered a wide range of incomes and social levels. The [[Indiana Klan]] was perhaps the most prominent Ku Klux Klan in the nation. It claimed more than  30% of white male Hoosiers as members.&lt;ref name=nicfh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforhistory.org/indiana_history_main7.html|title=Indiana History Chapter Seven|publisher=Northern Indiana Center for History|access-date=October 7, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411163028/http://www.centerforhistory.org/indiana_history_main7.html|archivedate=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 it supported Republican [[Edward L. Jackson|Edward Jackson]] in his successful campaign for governor.&lt;ref name="Library" /&gt;

Catholic and liberal Democrats—who were strongest in northeastern cities—decided to make the Klan an issue at the [[1924 Democratic National Convention]] in New York City. Their delegates proposed a resolution indirectly attacking the Klan; it was defeated by one vote out of 1,100.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Slayton, ''Empire Statesman: The Rise and Redemption of Al Smith'' (2001) pp 211-13&lt;/ref&gt; The leading presidential candidates were [[William Gibbs McAdoo]], a Protestant with a base in the South and West where the Klan was strong, and New York Governor [[Al Smith]], a Catholic with a base in the large cities. After weeks of stalemate and bitter argumentation, both candidates withdrew in favor of a compromise candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lee N. |last=Allen |title=The McAdoo Campaign for the Presidential Nomination in 1924 |journal=Journal of Southern History |year=1963 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=211–228 |jstor=2205041 |doi=10.2307/2205041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Douglas B. |last=Craig |title=After Wilson: The Struggle for the Democratic Party, 1920–1934 |year=1992 |location=Chapel Hill |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |at=ch. 2–3 |isbn=978-0-8078-2058-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Children with Dr. Samuel Green, Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon, July 24, 1948.jpg|thumb|Two children wearing Ku Klux Klan robes and hoods stand on either side of Dr. [[Samuel Green (Ku Klux Klan)|Samuel Green]], a Ku Klux Klan [[Grand Dragon]], at [[Stone Mountain, Georgia]] on July 24, 1948.]]
In some states, such as Alabama and California, KKK chapters had worked for political reform. In 1924, Klan members were elected to the city council in [[Anaheim, California]]. The city had been controlled by an entrenched commercial-civic elite that was mostly [[German Americans|German American]]. Given their tradition of moderate social drinking, the German Americans did not strongly support Prohibition laws&amp;nbsp;— the mayor had been a saloon keeper.

Led by the minister of the First Christian Church, the Klan represented a rising group of politically oriented non-ethnic Germans who denounced the elite as corrupt, undemocratic and self-serving. The historian Christopher Cocoltchos says the Klansmen tried to create a model, orderly community. The Klan had about 1,200 members in [[Orange County, California]]. The economic and occupational profile of the pro and anti-Klan groups shows the two were similar and about equally prosperous. Klan members were Protestants, as were most of their opponents, but the latter also included many [[Catholic Germans]]. Individuals who joined the Klan had earlier demonstrated a much higher rate of voting and civic activism than did their opponents. Cocoltchos suggests that many of the individuals in Orange County joined the Klan out of that sense of civic activism. The Klan representatives easily won the local election in Anaheim in April 1924. They fired city employees who were known to be Catholic, and replaced them with Klan appointees. The new city council tried to enforce Prohibition. After its victory, the Klan chapter held large rallies and initiation ceremonies over the summer.&lt;ref name="Cocoltchos" /&gt;

The opposition organized, bribed a Klansman for the secret membership list, and exposed the Klansmen running in the state primaries; they defeated most of the candidates. Klan opponents in 1925 took back local government, and succeeded in a special election in recalling the Klansmen who had been elected in April 1924. The Klan in Anaheim quickly collapsed, its newspaper closed after losing a libel suit, and the minister who led the local [[Klavern]] moved to Kansas.&lt;ref name="Cocoltchos"&gt;Christopher N. Cocoltchos, "The Invisible Empire and the Search for the Orderly Community: The Ku Klux Klan in Anaheim, California", in Shawn Lay, ed. ''The invisible empire in the West'' (2004), pp. 97-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the South, Klan members were still Democratic, as it was essentially a one-party region for whites. Klan chapters were closely allied with Democratic police, sheriffs, and other functionaries of local government. Due to [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement]] of most African Americans and many poor whites around the start of the 20th century, the only political activity for whites took place within the Democratic Party.

In Alabama, Klan members advocated better public schools, effective [[Prohibition]] enforcement, expanded road construction, and other political measures to benefit lower-class white people. By 1925, the Klan was a political force in the state, as leaders such as [[J. Thomas Heflin]], [[David Bibb Graves]], and [[Hugo Black]] tried to build political power against the Black Belt wealthy [[Planter (American South)|planters]], who had long dominated the state.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, with Klan support, [[Bibb Graves]] won the Alabama governor's office. He was a former Klan chapter head. He pushed for increased education funding, better public health, new highway construction, and pro-labor legislation. Because the Alabama state legislature refused to redistrict until 1972, and then under court order, the Klan was unable to break the planters' and rural areas' hold on legislative power.

Scholars and biographers have recently examined Hugo Black's Klan role. Ball finds regarding the KKK that Black "sympathized with the group's economic, nativist, and anti-Catholic beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;Howard Ball, ''Hugo L. Black: cold steel warrior'' (1996) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Newman says Black "disliked the Catholic Church as an institution" and gave over 100 anti-Catholic speeches in his 1926 election campaign to KKK meetings across Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;Roger K. Newman, ''Hugo Black: A Biography'' (1997) pp 87, 104&lt;/ref&gt; Black was elected US senator in 1926 as a Democrat. In 1937 President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] appointed Black to the Supreme Court without knowing how active in the Klan he had been in the 1920s. He was confirmed by his fellow Senators before the full KKK connection was known; Justice Black said he left the Klan when he became a senator.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, ''Hugo L. Black: Cold Steel Warrior'' (1996) p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance and decline===
[[File:D. C. Stephenson Grand Dragon of the Klu Klux Klan in Indiana, c 1922.jpg|thumb|upright|[[D. C. Stephenson]], Grand Dragon of the [[Indiana Klan]]. His conviction in 1925 for the murder of [[Madge Oberholtzer]], a white schoolteacher, led to the decline of the Indiana Klan.]]

Many groups and leaders, including prominent Protestant ministers such as [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] in Detroit, spoke out against the Klan, gaining national attention. The Jewish [[Anti-Defamation League]] was formed in the early 20th century in response to attacks on [[American Jews|Jewish Americans]], including the lynching of [[Leo Frank]] in Atlanta, and the Klan's campaign to prohibit private schools (which was chiefly aimed at Catholic parochial schools). Opposing groups worked to penetrate the Klan's secrecy. After one civic group in Indiana began to publish Klan membership lists, there was a rapid decline in the number of Klan members. The [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) launched public education campaigns in order to inform people about Klan activities and lobbied in Congress against Klan abuses. After its peak in 1925, Klan membership in most areas began to decline rapidly.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

Specific events contributed to the Klan's decline as well. In Indiana, the scandal surrounding the 1925 murder trial of Grand Dragon [[D. C. Stephenson]] destroyed the image of the KKK as upholders of law and order. By 1926 the Klan was "crippled and discredited."&lt;ref name="Library"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/library/2848.htm|title=Ku Klux Klan in Indiana|publisher=Indiana State Library|date=November 2000|access-date=September 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; D. C. Stephenson was the Grand Dragon of Indiana and 22 northern states. In 1923 he had led the states under his control in order to break away from the national KKK organization. At his 1925 trial, he was convicted of second-degree murder for his part in the rape, and subsequent death, of [[Madge Oberholtzer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianahistory.org/library/manuscripts/collection_guides/m0264.html |title=D. C. Stephenson manuscript collection |publisher=Indiana Historical Society |access-date=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Stephenson's conviction, the Klan declined dramatically in Indiana.

The historian Leonard Moore says that a failure in leadership caused the Klan's collapse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Stephenson and the other salesmen and office seekers who maneuvered for control of Indiana's Invisible Empire lacked both the ability and the desire to use the political system to carry out the Klan's stated goals. They were uninterested in, or perhaps even unaware of, grass roots concerns within the movement. For them, the Klan had been nothing more than a means for gaining wealth and power. These marginal men had risen to the top of the hooded order because, until it became a political force, the Klan had never required strong, dedicated leadership. More established and experienced politicians who endorsed the Klan, or who pursued some of the interests of their Klan constituents, also accomplished little. Factionalism created one barrier, but many politicians had supported the Klan simply out of expedience. When charges of crime and corruption began to taint the movement, those concerned about their political futures had even less reason to work on the Klan's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1991, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Kkk1928.jpg|thumb|left|Ku Klux Klan members march down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. in 1928]]
In Alabama, KKK [[vigilantes]] launched a wave of physical terror in 1927. They targeted both blacks and whites for violations of racial norms and for perceived moral lapses.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers et al., pp. 432–433.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a strong backlash, beginning in the media. [[Grover C. Hall]], Sr., editor of the ''[[Montgomery Advertiser]]'' from 1926, wrote a series of editorials and articles that attacked the Klan. (Today the paper says it "waged war on the resurgent [KKK]".)&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/99999999/CUSTOMERSERVICE01/91026023/History-Montgomery-Advertiser "History of the Montgomery Advertiser"].

The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved November 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other newspapers kept up a steady, loud attack on the Klan, referring to the organization as violent and "un-American". Sheriffs cracked down on activities. In the [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928 presidential election]], the state voters overcame their initial opposition to the Catholic candidate [[Al Smith]], and voted the Democratic Party line as usual.

Although in decline, a measure of the Klan's influence was still evident when it staged its march along [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1928. By 1930, Klan membership in Alabama dropped to less than 6,000. Small independent units continued to be active in the industrial city of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]].

KKK units were active through the 1930s in parts of Georgia, with a group of "night riders" in [[Atlanta]] enforcing their moral views by flogging people who violated them, whites as well as blacks. In March 1940, they were implicated in the beating murders of a young white couple taken from their car on a lovers lane, and flogged a white barber to death for drinking, both in East Point, a suburb of Atlanta. More than 20 others were "brutally flogged." As the police began to investigate, they found the records of the KKK had disappeared from their East Point office. The cases were reported by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''&lt;ref name="records"&gt;[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1940/03/24/page/19/article/klans-records-vanish-in-face-of-terror-quiz "Klan's Records Vanish in Terror Quiz/Floggers Linked to Killings in Lovers Lane"], ''Chicago Tribune,'' 24 March 1940; accessed 3 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and the NAACP in its ''[[Crisis]]'' magazine,&lt;ref name="crisis"&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=October 1940 |title=Sixth Lynching |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA324 |magazine=[[The Crisis]] |publisher=[[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=323–324}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as local papers.

Three lynchings of black men by whites (no KKK affiliation is known) took place in the South that year: [[Elbert Williams]] was the first NAACP member known to be killed for civil rights activities: he was murdered in [[Brownsville, Tennessee]] for working to register blacks to vote, and several other activists were run out of town; [[Jesse Thornton]] was lynched in [[Luverne, Alabama]] for a minor social infraction; and 16-year-old [[Lynching of Austin Callaway|Austin Callaway]], a suspect in the assault of a white woman, was taken from jail in the middle of the night and killed by six white men in [[LaGrange, Georgia]].&lt;ref name="crisis" /&gt; In January 2017, the police chief and mayor of LaGrange apologized for their offices' failures to protect Callaway, at a reconciliation service marking the anniversary of his death.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/26/us/lagrange-georgia-callaway-1940-lynching/ |title='Justice failed Austin Callaway': Town attempts to atone for 1940 lynching |author=Emanuella Grinberg |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/nightly-news-full-broadcast-january-27th-864596547728|title=Nightly News Full Broadcast (January 27th)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Labor and anti-unionism====
In major Southern cities such as [[Birmingham, Alabama]], Klan members kept control of access to the better-paying industrial jobs and opposed unions. During the 1930s and 1940s, Klan leaders urged members to disrupt the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO), which advocated industrial unions and accepted African-American members, unlike earlier unions. With access to dynamite and using the skills from their jobs in mining and steel, in the late 1940s some Klan members in Birmingham used bombings to destroy houses in order to intimidate upwardly mobile blacks who moved into middle-class neighborhoods. "By mid-1949, there were so many charred house carcasses that the area [College Hills] was informally named Dynamite Hill."&lt;ref name=Carry /&gt;

Activism by these independent KKK groups in Birmingham increased as a reaction to the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s. Independent Klan groups violently opposed the civil rights movement.&lt;ref name=Carry&gt;Diane McWhorter, ''Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama, The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution'', New York: Touchstone Book, 2002, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; KKK members were implicated in the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] on a Sunday in September 1963, which killed four African-American girls and injured 22 other people. Members of the [[Communist Workers' Party (United States)|Communist Workers' Party]] came to North Carolina to organize textile workers and pushed back against racial discrimination there, taunting the KKK, resulting in the 1979 [[Greensboro massacre#Background|Greensboro massacre]].&lt;ref name=wayback /&gt;&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite web| title='Death to the Klan' March|url=http://ncpedia.org/death-klan-march|website=NCpedia | publisher= [[North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources]]| access-date= 26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National changes==
In 1939, after experiencing several years of decline due to the [[Great Depression]], the [[Grand Wizard|Imperial Wizard]] [[Hiram Wesley Evans]] sold the national organization to [[James A. Colescott]], an Indiana [[veterinary physician]], and [[Samuel Green (Ku Klux Klan)|Samuel Green]], an Atlanta [[Obstetrics|obstetrician]]. They could not revive the Klan's declining membership. In 1944, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] filed a lien for $685,000 in back taxes against the Klan, and Colescott dissolved the organization that year. Local Klan groups closed down over the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Georgia Orders Action to Revoke Charter of Klan.

After [[World War II]], the folklorist and author [[Stetson Kennedy]] infiltrated the Klan; he provided internal data to media and law enforcement agencies. He also provided secret code words to the writers of the ''[[Superman (radio)|Superman]]'' radio program, resulting in episodes in which [[Superman]] took on the KKK. Kennedy stripped away the Klan's mystique and trivialized its rituals and code words, which may have contributed to the decline in Klan recruiting and membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=von Busack |title=Superman Versus the KKK |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/07.02.98/comics-9826.html |work=MetroActive |access-date=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, Kennedy wrote a bestselling book about his experiences, which further damaged the Klan.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historiography of the second Klan===

The historiography of the second Klan of the 1920s has changed over time. Early histories were based on mainstream sources of the time, and since the late 20th century, other histories have been written drawing from records and analysis of members of the chapters - in social histories.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Fox, "Changing interpretations of the 1920s Klan: A selected historiography" in Fox, ''Everyday Klansfolk: White Protestant Life and the KKK in 1920s Michigan'' (2012), Introduction [https://www.amazon.com/Everyday-Klansfolk-White-Protestant-Michigan-ebook/dp/B007P56JBW/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas R.

====Anti-modern interpretations====
[[File:Ku Klux Klan parade7.jpg|thumb|Ku Klux Klan parade in [[Washington, D.C.]], September 1926 ]]

The KKK was a secret organization; apart from a few top leaders, most members never identified as such and wore masks in public. Investigators in the 1920s used KKK publicity, court cases, exposés by disgruntled Klansman, newspaper reports, and speculation to write stories about what the Klan was doing. Almost all the major national newspapers and magazines were hostile to its activities. The historian Thomas R. Pegram says that published accounts exaggerated the official viewpoint of the Klan leadership, and repeated the interpretations of hostile newspapers and the Klan's enemies. There was almost no evidence in that time regarding the behavior or beliefs of individual Klansmen. According to Pegram, the resulting popular and scholarly interpretation of the Klan from the 1920s into the mid-20th century, emphasized its Southern roots and the violent vigilante-style actions of the Klan in its efforts to turn back the clock of modernity. Scholars compared it to [[fascism]] in   Europe.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Chalmers, ''Hooded Americanism: The First Century of the Ku Klux Klan, 1865–1965'' (1965) p 322&lt;/ref&gt;  Amann states that, "Undeniably, the Klan had some traits in common with European fascism--chauvinism, racism, a mystique of violence, an affirmation of a certain kind of archaic traditionalism--yet their differences were fundamental. ... [the KKK] never envisioned a change of political or economic system."&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Amann, "A 'Dog in the Nighttime' Problem: American Fascism in the 1930s," ''History Teacher''  19#4 (1986), pp. 559-584 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/493879  online] at  p 562.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pegram says this original interpretation:

{{quote|Depicted the Klan movement as an irrational rebuke of modernity by undereducated, economically marginal bigots, religious zealots, and dupes willing to be manipulated by the Klan's cynical, mendacious leaders. It was, in this view, a movement of country parsons and small-town malcontents who were out of step with the dynamism of twentieth-century urban America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pegram|first=Thomas R.|title=One Hundred Percent American: The Rebirth and Decline of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aplUFE1XIcQC&amp;pg=PA222|page=222|access-date=February 27, 2016|isbn=9781566639224|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====New social history interpretations====
The "[[social history]]" revolution in historiography from the 1960s explored history from the bottom up. In terms of the Klan, it developed evidence based on the characteristics, beliefs, and behavior of the typical membership, and downplayed accounts by elite sources.&lt;ref&gt;Pegram, ''One Hundred Percent American,'' p 225&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonard J. Moore, "Good Old-Fashioned New Social History and the Twentieth-Century American Right," ''Reviews in American History'' (1996) 24#4 pp: 555-573 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v024/24.4moore.html online].&lt;/ref&gt; Historians discovered membership lists and the minutes of local meetings from KKK chapters scattered around the country. They discovered that the original interpretation was largely mistaken about the membership and activities of the Klan; the membership was not anti-modern, rural or rustic and consisted of fairly well educated middle-class joiners and community activists. Half the members lived in the fast-growing industrial cities of the period: Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Denver, and Portland, Oregon, were Klan strongholds during the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth T. Jackson, ''The Ku Klux Klan in the City, 1915–1930'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies developed as social history find that in general, the KKK membership in these cities was from the stable, successful middle classes, with few members drawn from the elite or the working classes. Pegram, reviewing the studies, concludes, "the popular Klan of the 1920s, while diverse, was more of a civic exponent of white Protestant social values than a repressive hate group."&lt;ref&gt;Pegram, ''One Hundred Percent American'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=aplUFE1XIcQC&amp;pg=PA225 p.225]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly J. Baker{{who|date=September 2018}} argues that religion was critical – the KKK based its hatred on a particular brand of Protestantism that resonated with mainstream Americans: "Members embraced Protestant Christianity and a crusade  to save America from  domestic as well as foreign threats."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly J. Baker, ''Gospel According to the Klan: The KKK's Appeal to Protestant America, 1915-1930'' (2017) p 11&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indiana and Alabama====
In Indiana, traditional political historians focused on notorious leaders, especially [[D. C. Stephenson]], the Grand Dragon of the [[Indiana Klan]], whose conviction for 1925 kidnap, rape, and murder of [[Madge Oberholtzer]] helped destroy the Ku Klux Klan movement nationwide. In his history of 1967, Kenneth Jackson already described the Klan of the 1920s as associated with cities and urbanization, with chapters often acting as a kind of fraternal organization to aid people coming from other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''The Klan in the Cities,'' 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

Social historian Leonard Moore titled his monograph ''Citizen Klansmen'' (1997) and contrasted the intolerant rhetoric of the group's leaders with the actions of most of the membership. The Klan was white Protestant, established Americans who were fearful of change: represented by new immigrants and black migrants to the North. They were highly suspicious of Catholics, Jews and blacks, who they believed subverted ideal Protestant moral standards. Violence was uncommon in most chapters. In Indiana, KKK members directed more threats and economic blacklisting primarily against fellow white Protestants for transgressions of community moral standards, such as adultery, [[Domestic violence|wife-beating]], [[gambling]] and heavy drinking. Up to one third of Indiana's Protestant men joined the order making it, Moore argued, "a kind of interest group for average white Protestants who believed that their values should be dominant in their community and state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonard J. Moore|title=Citizen Klansmen: The Ku Klux Klan in Indiana, 1921–1928|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a1eSbL0kxk8C&amp;pg=PA188|year=1997|publisher=U. North Carolina Press|page=188|access-date=February 27, 2016|isbn=9780807846278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore says that they joined:

{{quote|because it stood for the most organized means of resisting the social and economic forces that had transformed community life, undermined traditional values, and made average citizens feel more isolated from one another and more powerless in their relationships with the major institutions that governed their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Citizen Klansmen'' p 188&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Northern Indiana's industrial cities had attracted a large Catholic population of European immigrants and their descendants. They established the [[University of Notre Dame]], a major Catholic college near South Bend. In May 1924 when the KKK scheduled a regional meeting in the city, Notre Dame students blocked the Klansmen and stole some KKK regalia. The next day the Klansmen counterattacked. Finally the college president and the football coach [[Knute Rockne]] kept the students on campus to avert further violence.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Hope. ''The Story of Notre Dame'' (1999) ch 26 [http://archives.nd.edu/hope/hope26.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the semi-fictional account {{Cite book|title=Notre Dame vs. The Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan|last=Tucker|first=Todd|publisher=Loyola Pr|year=2004|isbn=978-0829417715|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alabama, some young white urban activists joined the KKK to fight the old guard establishment. [[Hugo Black]] was a member before becoming nationally famous; he focused on anti-Catholicism.  But in rural Alabama the Klan continued to operate to enforce [[Jim Crow]]; its members resorted more often to violence against blacks for infringements of the social order of white supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Feldman, ''Politics, Society, and the Klan in Alabama, 1915–1949'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial terrorism was used in smaller towns to suppress black political activity; Elbert Williams of [[Brownsville, Tennessee]] was lynched in 1940 for trying to organize black residents to register and vote. That year, Jesse Thornton of [[Luverne, Alabama]] was lynched for failing to address a police officer as "Mister."&lt;ref&gt;"Sixth Lynching", ''The Crisis,'' October 1940, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later Klans: 1950s–present==

===1950s–1960s: post-war opposition to civil rights===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Poster35.jpg|thumb|[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] propaganda poster (''Freedom, American style'', 1950, by Nikolay Dolgorukov and [[Boris Efimov]]), showing the KKK's lynchings of blacks. {{ifdc|File:Poster35.jpg|log=2012 June 7}}]] --&gt;
After the decline of the national organization, small independent groups adopted the name "Ku Klux Klan," along with variations.  They had no formal connection to the second KKK, except for the fact that they copied its terminology and costumes.  Beginning in the 1950s, for instance, individual Klan groups in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], began to resist social change and blacks' efforts to improve their lives by bombing houses in transitional neighborhoods.  The white men worked in mining and steel industries, with access to these materials.  There were so many bombings of blacks' homes in Birmingham by Klan groups in the 1950s that the city was nicknamed "[[Bombingham]]".&lt;ref name="McWhorter" /&gt;

During the tenure of [[Bull Connor]] as police commissioner in Birmingham, Klan groups were closely allied with the police and operated with impunity. When the [[Freedom Riders]] arrived in Birmingham in 1961, Connor gave Klan members fifteen minutes to attack the riders before sending in the police to quell the attack.&lt;ref name="McWhorter" /&gt; When local and state authorities failed to protect the Freedom Riders and activists, the federal government began to establish intervention and protection.

In states such as Alabama and [[Mississippi]], Klan members forged alliances with governors' administrations.&lt;ref name="McWhorter" /&gt; In Birmingham and elsewhere, the KKK groups bombed the houses of [[civil rights]] activists. In some cases they used physical violence, intimidation and assassination directly against individuals. Continuing [[disfranchisement]] of blacks across the South meant that most could not serve on juries, which were [[all-white juries|all-white]] and demonstrably biased verdicts and sentences.

[[File:FBI Poster of Missing Civil Rights Workers.jpg|thumb|[[Andrew Goodman|Goodman]], [[James Chaney|Chaney]], and [[Michael Schwerner|Schwerner]] were three civil rights workers abducted and murdered by members of the Ku Klux Klan.]]
According to a report from the [[Southern Regional Council]] in [[Atlanta]], the homes of 40 black Southern families were bombed during 1951 and 1952. Some of the bombing victims were social activists whose work exposed them to danger, but most were either people who refused to bow to racist convention or were innocent bystanders, unsuspecting victims of random violence.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton 1994, p. 562–563.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the more notorious murders by Klan members in the 1950s and 1960s:
* The 1951 Christmas Eve bombing of the home of [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) activists [[Harry T. Moore|Harry and Harriette Moore]] in [[Mims, Florida]], resulting in their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/454.html "Who Was Harry T. Moore?"]&amp;nbsp;— ''The Palm Beach Post'', August 16, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1957 murder of [[Willie Edwards|Willie Edwards Jr]]. Klansmen forced Edwards to jump to his death from a bridge into the [[Alabama River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Major W. |last=Cox |authorlink= |title=Justice Still Absent in Bridge Death |url=http://www.majorcox.com/columns/edwards1.htm |work=[[Montgomery Advertiser]] |date=March 2, 1999 |access-date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126110805/http://majorcox.com/columns/edwards1.htm |archivedate=November 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1963 assassination of NAACP organizer [[Medgar Evers]] in Mississippi. In 1994, former Ku Klux Klansman [[Byron De La Beckwith]] was convicted.
* The [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] in September 1963 in Birmingham, Alabama, which killed four [[African-American]] girls and injured 22 people. The perpetrators were Klan members [[Robert Chambliss]], convicted in 1977, [[Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr.]] and [[Bobby Frank Cherry]], convicted in 2001 and 2002. The fourth suspect, [[Herman Cash]], died before he was indicted.
* The 1964 [[murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner]], three civil rights workers,  in Mississippi. In June 2005, Klan member [[Edgar Ray Killen]] was convicted of [[manslaughter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kris |last=Axtman |authorlink= |title=Mississippi verdict greeted by a generation gap |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0623/p01s03-ussc.html |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |publisher= |date=June 23, 2005 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1964 murder of two black teenagers, [[Mississippi Cold Case#Moore and Dee murders|Henry Hezekiah Dee]] and [[Mississippi Cold Case#Moore and Dee murders|Charles Eddie Moore]] in Mississippi. In August 2007, based on the confession of Klansman [[Charles Marcus Edwards]], [[James Ford Seale]], a reputed Ku Klux Klansman, was convicted. Seale was sentenced to serve three life sentences. Seale was a former Mississippi policeman and sheriff's deputy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.findlaw.com/usatoday/docs/crights/usseale12407ind.html |title=Reputed Klansman, Ex-Cop, and Sheriff's Deputy Indicted For The 1964 Murders of Two Young African-American Men in Mississippi; U.S. v.

* The 1965 Alabama murder of [[Viola Liuzzo]]. She was a Southern-raised [[Detroit]] mother of five who was visiting the state in order to attend a civil rights march. At the time of her murder, Liuzzo was transporting Civil Rights marchers related to the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma to Montgomery March]].
* The 1966 firebombing death of NAACP leader [[Vernon Dahmer]], Sr., 58, in Mississippi. In 1998 former Ku Klux Klan wizard [[Samuel Bowers]] was convicted of his murder and sentenced to life. Two other Klan members were indicted with Bowers, but one died before trial, and the other's indictment was dismissed.
* On July 1966, in [[Bogalusa, Louisiana]], a stronghold of Klan activity, Clarence Triggs was found murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2009/klan-murder-shines-light-bogalusa-la|title=Klan Murder Shines Light on Bogalusa, La.|last=Keller|first=Larry|date=May 29, 2009|work=Intelligence Report|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1967 multiple bombings in Jackson, Mississippi of the residence of a [[Methodism|Methodist]] activist, Robert Kochtitzky, the [[synagogue]] and the residence of [[Rabbi]] Perry Nussbaum. These were carried out by  Klan member Thomas Albert Tarrants III, who was convicted in 1968. Another Klan bombing was averted in Meridian the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Jack. (1993).

====Resistance====
There was considerable resistance among African Americans and white allies to the Klan. In 1953, newspaper publishers [[W. Horace Carter]] ([[Tabor City, North Carolina]]), who had campaigned for three years, and Willard Cole ([[Whiteville, North Carolina]]) shared the [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] citing "their successful campaign against the Ku Klux Klan, waged on their own doorstep at the risk of economic loss and personal danger, culminating in the conviction of over one hundred Klansmen and an end to terrorism in their communities."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Public-Service "Public Service"]. The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved November 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1958 incident in [[North Carolina]], the Klan burned crosses at the homes of two [[Lumbee]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for associating with white people, and threatened more actions. When the KKK held a nighttime rally nearby, they were quickly surrounded by hundreds of armed Lumbee. Gunfire was exchanged, and the Klan was routed at what became known as the [[Battle of Hayes Pond]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingalls 1979; {{cite web |url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/ref/nchistory/jan2005/jan05.html |title=January 1958&amp;nbsp;– The Lumbees face the Klan |author=Graham, Nicholas |date=January 2005 |website= |publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) had paid informants in the Klan, for instance in Birmingham in the early 1960s, its relations with local law enforcement agencies and the Klan were often ambiguous. The head of the FBI, [[J. Edgar Hoover]], appeared more concerned about Communist links to civil rights activists than about controlling Klan excesses against citizens. In 1964, the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]] program began attempts to infiltrate and disrupt civil rights groups.&lt;ref name="McWhorter" /&gt;

As 20th-century Supreme Court rulings extended federal enforcement of citizens' [[civil rights]], the government revived the [[Enforcement Acts]] and the [[Klan Act]] from Reconstruction days. Federal prosecutors used these laws as the basis for investigations and indictments in the 1964 [[murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.smu.edu/dsimon/Change-CivRts2.html |title=The Civil Rights Movement, 1964–1968 |access-date= |author=Simon, Dennis M |publisher=[[Southern Methodist University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050827194827/http://faculty.smu.edu/dsimon/Change-CivRts2.html |archivedate=August 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1965 murder of [[Viola Liuzzo]]. They were also the basis for prosecution in 1991 in ''[[Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic]]''.

In 1965, the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] started an investigation on the Klan, putting in the public spotlight its front organizations, finances, methods and divisions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1965|title=Ku Klux Klan Probe Begun|url=https://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal65-875-26759-1261051|journal=CQ Almanac|edition=21|volume=|pages=1517–1525|access-date=August 14, 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s–present===
[[File:Kkk-march-violence.jpg|thumb|Violence at a Klan march in [[Mobile, Alabama]], 1977]]
After federal legislation was passed prohibiting legal segregation and authorizing enforcement of protection of voting rights, KKK groups began to oppose court-ordered [[desegregation busing|busing to desegregate schools]], [[affirmative action]], and the more open [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] authorized in the 1960s. In 1971, KKK members used bombs to destroy 10 school buses in [[Pontiac, Michigan]]. By 1975, there were known KKK groups on most college campuses in Louisiana as well as at [[Vanderbilt University]], the [[University of Georgia]], the [[University of Mississippi]], the [[University of Akron]], and the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref name="imperialwizardofkkk"&gt;{{cite news|title='Ladies' Become Vocal in Ku Klux Klan |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/22745082/?terms=%22vanderbilt%2Buniversity%22%2B%22ku%2Bklux%2Bklan%22 |newspaper=The Post-Crescent (Appleton, Wisconsin) |date=May 23, 1975 |page=9|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|access-date = July 15, 2015 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Massacre of Communist Workers Party protesters====
{{Main|Greensboro massacre}}
On November 3, 1979, five communist protesters were killed by KKK and [[American Nazi Party]] members in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] in what is known as the [[Greensboro massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2004/11/18/remembering_the_1979_greensboro_massacre_25 |title=Remembering the 1979 Greensboro Massacre: 25 Years Later Survivors Form Country's First Truth and Reconciliation Commission |work=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=November 18, 2004|access-date=August 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Communist Workers' Party (United States)|Communist Workers Party]] had sponsored a rally against the Klan in an effort to organize predominantly black industrial workers in the area.&lt;ref name=wayback &gt;Mark Hand (November 18, 2004).

====Jerry Thompson infiltration====
Jerry Thompson, a newspaper reporter who infiltrated the KKK in 1979, reported that the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]] efforts were highly successful. Rival KKK factions accused each other's leaders of being [[FBI informant]]s. William Wilkinson of the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, was revealed to have been working for the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson also related that KKK leaders showed great concern about a series of civil lawsuits filed by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], claiming damages amounting to millions of dollars. These were filed after KKK members shot into a group of African Americans.&lt;!-- which event is this? --&gt; Klansmen curtailed their activities in order to conserve money for defense against the lawsuits. The KKK also used lawsuits as tools; they filed a libel suit in order to prevent the publication of a paperback edition of Thompson's book, but were unsuccessful.

====Chattanooga, Tennessee shooting====
In 1980, three KKK members shot four elderly black women (Viola Ellison, Lela Evans, Opal Jackson, and Katherine Johnson) in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], following a KKK initiation rally. A fifth woman, Fannie Crumsey, was injured by flying glass in the incident. Attempted murder charges were filed against the three KKK members, two of whom—Bill Church and Larry Payne—were acquitted by an [[all-white jury]]. The third defendant, Marshall Thrash, was sentenced by the same jury to nine months on lesser charges. He was released after three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=r59bGyH4lOAC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=1980+chattanooga+kkk+shootings |title=The White Separatist Movement in the United States: "White Power, White Pride!" |author=Betty A.

====Michael Donald lynching====
After [[Lynching of Michael Donald|Michael Donald was lynched]] in 1981 in [[Alabama]], the FBI investigated his death. The US Attorney prosecuted the case. Two local KKK members were convicted for his murder, including Henry Francis Hays, who was sentenced to death. With the support of attorneys [[Morris Dees]] of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) and State Senator Michael A. Figures, Donald's mother Beulah Mae Donald sued the KKK in civil court in Alabama. Her lawsuit against the [[United Klans of America]] was tried in February 1987.&lt;ref name="jesse" /&gt; After exhausting the appeals process, Hays was executed by [[electric chair]] for Donald's death in Alabama on June 6, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Klansman sheds tears for victim before execution|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/564664/Ex-Klansman-sheds-tears-for-victim-before-execution.html?pg=all|access-date=June 15, 2016|work=Deseret News|date=June 6, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time since 1913 that a white man had been executed in Alabama for a crime against an African American.&lt;ref name="age" /&gt;

The all-white jury found the Klan responsible for the lynching of Donald and ordered the Klan to pay US$7 million, but the KKK did not have sufficient funds to pay the fine.

====Neo-Nazi alliances and Stormfront====
{{Main|Stormfront (website)}}
In 1995, [[Don Black (white supremacist)|Don Black]] and Chloê Hardin, the ex-wife of the KKK Grand Wizard [[David Duke]], began a small [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) called [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]]. In the 21st century, Stormfront has become a prominent online forum for [[white nationalism]], [[Neo-Nazism]], [[hate speech]], [[racism]], and [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/12/5/143556/393 "RedState, White Supremacy, and Responsibility"], ''[[Daily Kos]],'' December 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FOX"&gt;[[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,86338,00.html "Circling the Wagons in Georgia"], [[Fox News]], May 8, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2001/dtv2001-0023.html "WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center: Case No. DTV2001-0023"], [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], January 13, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke has an account on Stormfront which he uses to post articles from his own website. He also polls forum members for opinions and questions, in particular during his internet broadcasts. Duke has worked with Don Black on numerous projects including [[Operation Red Dog]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manana.com/dominica.htm Captmike works undercover with the US Government to stop the invasion of the Island Nation of Dominica], manana.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadiancontent.ca/articles/031401reddog.html Operation Red Dog: Canadian neo-nazis were central to the planned invasion of Dominica in 1981] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217200558/http://www.canadiancontent.ca/articles/031401reddog.html |date=February 17, 2007 }}, canadiancontent.ca.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Current developments====
The modern KKK is not one organization; rather it is composed of small independent chapters across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/default.asp |title=About the Ku Klux Klan&amp;nbsp;– Extremism in America |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725122657/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/default.asp |archivedate=July 25, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1999 ADL report, the KKK's estimated size then was "No more than a few thousand, organized into slightly more than 100 units."&lt;ref name=adl-ak-kkk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/backgrounders/american_knights_kkk.asp |title=Church of the American Knights of the KKK |access-date=July 28, 2010 |date=October 22, 1999 |website= |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901094652/http://www.adl.org/backgrounders/american_knights_kkk.asp |archivedate=September 1, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), which monitors extremist groups, estimated that there were "at least 29 separate, rival Klan groups currently active in the United States, and they compete with one another for members, dues, news media attention and the title of being the true heir to the Ku Klux Klan."&lt;ref name="Stack"&gt;Liam Stack, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/kkk-leader-death-frank-ancona.html Leader of a Ku Klux Klan Group Is Found Dead in Missouri], ''New York Times'' (February 13, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of independent chapters has made KKK groups more difficult to infiltrate, and researchers find it hard to estimate their numbers. Analysts believe that about two-thirds of KKK members are concentrated in the [[Southern United States]], with another third situated primarily in the lower [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].&lt;ref name=adl-ak-kkk /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/map/hate.jsp |title=Active U.S. Hate Groups |website=Intelligence Report |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406181750/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/map/hate.jsp |archivedate=April 6, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adl-kkk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/default.asp |title=About the Ku Klux Klan&amp;nbsp;– Extremism in America |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |access-date=July 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725122657/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/default.asp |archivedate=July 25, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Klan has expanded its recruitment efforts to white supremacists at the international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sify.com/news/ku-klux-klan-warns-race-war-if-obama-wins-news-international-jegv8yeajcg.html |title=Ku Klux Klan warns race war if Obama wins |date=November 3, 2008 |publisher=[[Sify|Sify News]] |access-date=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some time, the Klan's numbers have been steadily dropping. This decline has been attributed to the Klan's lack of competence in the use of the [[Internet]], their history of violence, a proliferation of competing [[hate group]]s, and a decline in the number of young [[racism|racist]] activists who are willing to join groups at all.&lt;ref name="Slate 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Brian|title=Ku Klux Kontraction: How did the KKK lose nearly one-third of its chapters in one year?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/03/ku_klux_klan_in_decline_why_did_the_kkk_lose_so_many_chapters_in_2010_.html|access-date=March 25, 2012|newspaper=[[Slate Magazine]]|date=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2016 analysis by the SPLC, hate groups in general are on the rise in the United States.&lt;ref name="splc2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2016/year-hate-and-extremism|title=The Year in Hate and Extremism|publisher=Southern Poverty Law }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ADL published a report in 2016 that concluded: "Despite a persistent ability to attract media attention, organized Ku Klux Klan groups are actually continuing a long-term trend of decline. They remain a collection of mostly small, disjointed groups that continually change in name and leadership."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/assets/pdf/combating-hate/tattered-robes-state-of-kkk-2016.pdf Tattered Robes: The State of the Ku Klux Klan in the United States], Anti-Defamation League (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, however, the number of KKK chapters nationwide grew from 72 to 190. The SPLC released a similar report stating that "there were significant increases in Klan as well as [[Black separatism|black separatist]] groups."&lt;ref name="splc2016" /&gt;

Recent KKK membership campaigns have stimulated people's anxieties about [[illegal immigration]], urban crime, [[civil union]]s, and [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0209/p02s02-ussc.html |title=Anti-Immigrant Sentiments Fuel Ku Klux Klan Resurgence |author=Knickerbocker, Brad |date=February 9, 2007 |website=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 J. Keith Akins argued that, "Klan literature and propaganda is rabidly [[homophobic]] and encourages violence against [[gays]] and [[lesbians]]&amp;nbsp;... Since the late 1970s, the Klan has increasingly focused its ire on this previously ignored population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ku Klux Klan: America's Forgotten Terrorists |author=Akins, J. Keith |website=Law Enforcement Executive Forum |page=137 |date=January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many KKK groups have formed strong alliances with other white supremacist groups, such as [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]]. Some KKK groups have become increasingly "nazified", adopting the look and emblems of [[white power skinhead]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/affiliations.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=4&amp;item=kkk |title=Ku Klux Klan&amp;nbsp;– Affiliations&amp;nbsp;– Extremism in America |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |access-date=July 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729144311/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/affiliations.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=4&amp;item=kkk |archivedate=July 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) has provided legal support to various factions of the KKK in defense of their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights to hold public rallies, parades, and marches, as well as their right to field political candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A.C.L.U. Lawsuit Backs Klan In Seeking Permit for Cross |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 16, 1993 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/16/us/aclu-lawsuit-backs-klan-in-seeking-permit-for-cross.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006202846/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/16/us/aclu-lawsuit-backs-klan-in-seeking-permit-for-cross.html |archivedate=October 6, 2010 }} The [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] professes a mission to defend the constitutional rights of all groups, whether [[left-wing politics|left]], [[centrism|center]], or right.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Imperial Wizard]] of the Traditionalist American Knights, Frank Ancona, was fatally shot in [[Missouri]] in February 2017, several days after disappearing. The [[coroner]] declared his death a [[homicide]]. Ancona's wife and stepson were charged with [[first-degree murder]] in connection with the killing. The prosecutor in the case believes that the killing "happened because of a marital dispute" and was not connected to Ancona's Klan participation.&lt;ref name="Stack" /&gt; Ancona's group "was not considered the largest or the most influential iteration of the Klan, but he was skilled at attracting the spotlight."&lt;ref name="Stack" /&gt;

==Outside the United States==
Aside from the Ku Klux Klan in Canada, there have been various attempts to organize KKK chapters outside the United States.

In [[Australia]] in the late 1990s, former [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]] member Peter Coleman established branches throughout the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/358783.stm|title=Ku Klux Klan sets up Australian branch|date=June 2, 1999|publisher=BBC News|access-date=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ansley|first=Greg|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=7865|title=Dark mystique of the KKK|date=June 5, 1999|publisher=''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''|access-date=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and circa 2012 the KKK has attempted to infiltrate other political parties such as [[Australia First Party|Australia First]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jensen|first=Erik|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/we-have-infiltrated-party-kkk-20090709-der4.html|title=We have infiltrated party: KKK|date=July 10, 2009|publisher=''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''|access-date=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recruitment activity has also been reported in the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hosken|first=Andy|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/366114.stm|title= KKK plans 'infiltration' of the UK|date=June 10, 1999|publisher=BBC News|access-date=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; dating back to the 1960s when [[Robert Relf]] was involved in establishing a British KKK.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations'', 2002, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]], a KKK-related group, ''Ritter des Feurigen Kreuzes'', was established in the 1920s. After the Nazis took over Germany, the group disbanded and its members joined the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politische-bildung-brandenburg.de/node/8756|title=Orden der Ritter vom feurigen Kreuz|website=www.politische-bildung-brandenburg.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another German KKK-related group, the European White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, has organized and it gained notoriety in 2012 when the German media reported that two police officers who held membership in the organization would be allowed to keep their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-police-kept-jobs-despite-ku-klux-klan-involvement-a-847831.html |title=German Police Kept Jobs Despite KKK Involvement |work=''[[Der Spiegel]] |date=2 August 2012 |first=Florian |last=Gathmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/369733/20120802/ku-klux-klan-nsu-germany-neo-nazi.htm |title=Ku Klux Klan: German Police Officers Allowed to Stay on Job Despite Links with European Branch of White Supremacists |work=[[International Business Times]] |date=July 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rt.com/news/kkk-police-germany-neo-nazi-760/ |title='KKK cops' scandal uncovered amid German neo-Nazi terror probe |work=[[RT (TV network)|Russia Today]] |date=3 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A KKK group was even established in [[Fiji]] in the early 1870s by white settlers, although it was put down by the British who, although not officially established as Fiji's colonial rulers, had played a leading role in establishing a new constitutional monarchy that was being threatened by the Fijian Klan.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Gravelle, ''Fiji's Times: A History of Fiji'', Suva: The Fiji Times, 1988, pp. 120-124&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], the website of a group called Imperial Klans of Brazil was shut down in 2003, and the group's leader was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/noticias/0,,OI158042-EI306,00-Jovem+ligado+a+Ku+Klux+Klan+e+detido+em+Sao+Paulo.html|title=Jovem ligado Ku Klux Klan detido em So Paulo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Titles and vocabulary==
{{Main|Kloran|Ku Klux Klan titles and vocabulary}}
Membership in the Klan is secret. Like many fraternal organizations, the Klan has signs that members can use to recognize one another.  In conversation, a member may use the acronym ''AYAK'' (Are you a Klansman?) to surreptitiously identify himself to another potential member. The response ''AKIA'' (A Klansman I am) completes the greeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/hate_symbols/acronyms_KIGY.asp |title=A Visual Database of Extremist Symbols, Logos and Tattoos |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |access-date=July 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815051939/http://www.adl.org/hate_symbols/acronyms_KIGY.asp |archivedate=August 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its varied history, the Klan has coined many words&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod 1997, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; beginning with "Kl", including:
* '''Klabee'''&amp;nbsp;— treasurers
* '''Klavern'''&amp;nbsp;— local organization
* '''Imperial Kleagle'''&amp;nbsp;— recruiter
* '''Klecktoken'''&amp;nbsp;— initiation fee
* '''Kligrapp'''&amp;nbsp;— secretary
* '''Klonvokation'''&amp;nbsp;— gathering
* '''[[Kloran]]'''&amp;nbsp;— ritual book
* '''Kloreroe'''&amp;nbsp;— delegate
* '''Imperial Kludd'''&amp;nbsp;— chaplain

All of the above terminology was created by William Joseph Simmons, as part of his 1915 revival of the Klan.&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1987, p. 142. "'It was rather difficult, sometimes, to make the two letters fit in,' he recalled later, 'but I did it somehow.'"&lt;/ref&gt; The Reconstruction-era Klan used different titles; the only titles to carry over were "[[Grand Wizard|Wizard]]" for the overall leader of the Klan and "Night Hawk" for the official in charge of security.

The Imperial Kludd was the chaplain of the Imperial Klonvokation and he performed "such other duties as may be required by the Imperial Wizard."

The Imperial Kaliff was the second highest position after the [[Grand Wizard|Imperial Wizard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chester L. Quarles&lt;!--|author-link=Chester L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1120">'''Leninist Group in the Iraqi Communist Movement''' ({{lang-ar|الفريق اللينيني في الحركة الشيوعية العراقية}}) was a grouping of [[Iraq]]i [[communist]] exiles, dissidents from the [[Iraqi Communist Party]]. The main leaders of the group were two university professors at the [[University of Algiers]], Khalid Abdullah as-Salam and Khalil al-Jazairi. Towards the late 1980s, the group began issuing a broadsheet publication, ''Nashrah''.&lt;ref name="ism"&gt;Ismael, Tareq Y. ''The Rise and Fall of the Communist Party of Iraq''. [[Cambridge]]/[[New York City|New York]]: Cambridge University Press, 2008. p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

The group signed an appeal of leftist and democratic exiles in the [[Ba'ath Party|Baath]]ist newspaper ''[[Al-Thawra (newspaper)|at-Thawra]]'' in December 1991. In the wake of the [[Gulf War|1991 war]], the Iraqi government issued a pardon for Iraqi exiles. As-Salam and al-Jazairi both returned to Iraq.&lt;ref name="ism"/&gt;

'''Loita Armada Revolucionaria''' ({{lang-en|italic=yes|Revolutionary Armed Struggle}}) was an armed [[Galician nationalism|Galician nationalist]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Galician independence|independentist]] organisation. Linked to the political party [[Galician Party of the Proletariat]] and the organization [[Galiza Ceibe-OLN]], the group was formed in 1978 and carried out several attacks around [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], such as bank assaults and bombing campaigns.

==History==
LAR made its first action on 28 July 1978, with the burning of some trucks in [[Santiago de Compostela]]. Shortly after, the band tried to assault, unsuccessfully, a [[tinderbox]] in [[Noia]]. LAR also made another armed actions, the best known were the robbery of a subsidiary of the [[Caja de Ahorros]] de [[Ourense]], attributed to [[Antom Árias Curto]] and the placement of explosives in the works of the ''[[Autopista AP-9|Highway AP-9]]'' (September 17, 1979).

In 1980, an important police raid led to the arrest of several members of the organization, including prominent activists and writers, among them writer and poet [[Xosé Luís Méndez Ferrín]]. The rest of the militants took refuge in Portugal. The detainees was applied antiterrorist law in force, remaining 10 days in solitary confinement, which reported being tortured.&lt;ref&gt;Xosé Manuel del Caño (2005): ''Conversas con Méndez Ferrín. Historia, literatura, nación.'' Edicións Xerais, [[Vigo]].&lt;/ref&gt; After the arrest only two of the detained were released without charge. The rest of the detainees entered different prisons of [[Galiza]], although later they would be subject of dispersion, applied by the Spanish legal system for the cases of terrorism, being relocated first in [[Madrid]] and then in [[Segovia]]. The organization in support of Galician prisoners, ''[[Xuntas Galegas pola Amnistía]]'' was formed as a result of the arrests. In 1981 the majority of the prisoners were released, although 5 of them remained in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Nieto Pereira, [[Xosé Cid Cabido]], [[Antom Árias Curto]], Edelmiro Domingues, Francisco Atanes and Arturo Estévez.&lt;/ref&gt; The trial took place in April 1982 in the [[Audiencia Nacional]] at [[Madrid]], and resulted in the conviction of all the remaining prisoners.

The government of [[Felipe González]] declared an [[amnesty]] for all the LAR prisoners in 1983. After the release of most of its members, the group announced its dissolution in 1984.

==Aftermath==
Loita Armada Revolucionaria was the first armed organization fighting for the independence of Galicia. Later, [[Liga Armada Galega]], ''[[Exército Guerrilheiro do Povo Galego Ceive]]'' and more recently [[Resistência Galega]] would follow the steps of LAR. The group had been linked with other independentist organizations active in Spain, such as [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]].

{{Politics of Malta}}

A referendum on divorce was held in [[Malta]] on 28 May 2011. Voters were asked whether they approved of a new law to introduce allowing divorces, as at that time, Malta was one of only three countries in the world (along with the [[Philippines]] and the [[Vatican City]])&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; in which divorce was not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ggvZ-jF8tctPa7jhyr6eQ3oBqWJA?docId=CNG.d73a80696980e3b5a3d31c519ccb3846.4e1|title=Malta to hold divorce referendum in May (AFP) |date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was approved by 53% of voters, resulting in a law allowing divorce under certain conditions being enacted later in the year.

==Background==
A [[private member's bill]] was tabled in the [[Maltese House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by [[Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando]], a [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalist]] Member of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlament.mt/file.aspx?f=14019 Motion No. 206 – Private Members Bill – Civil Code (Amendt) Bill – (1st Reading) – Presented by Hon Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando MP and Hon Evarist Bartolo MP (the Eleventh Parliament)]&lt;/ref&gt; The text of the bill, which had been changed twice, did not provide for the holding of a referendum. This was eventually provided for through a separate Parliamentary resolution under the [[Referenda Act (Malta)|Referenda Act]] authorising a [[non-binding referendum|facultative, non-binding referendum]] to be held.

The Catholic Church in Malta encouraged a "no" vote through a [[pastoral letter]] issued on the Sunday before the referendum day.&lt;ref name="ABC-Australia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/05/31/3231202.htm?section=justin|title=Malta votes to introduce divorce laws|publisher=ABC (Australia)|date=31 May 2011|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complaints were made that religious pressure was being brought to bear upon voters.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Around 8 per cent of marriages in Malta are already [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulled]] by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/27/malta-votes-on-divorce-catholic-church|title=Malta prepares to vote in historic referendum to allow divorce|publisher=The Guardian|date=27 May 2011|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Question==
Ballot papers had both English and [[Maltese language|Maltese]] questions printed on them. The English version of the question put to voters was as follows:

{{blockquote|Do you agree with the introduction of the option of divorce in the case of a married couple who has been separated or has been living apart for at least four (4) years, and where there is no reasonable hope for reconciliation between the spouses, whilst adequate maintenance is guaranteed and the children are protected?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doi.gov.mt/EN/gazetteonline/2011/03/gazts/GG%2030.3.pdf Writ by the President of Malta dated 28th March, 2011] Department of Information&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The question, which resembled the proposal approved by Irish voters in the [[Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Irish divorce referendum of 1995]], was somewhat controversial. It was claimed that it did not reflect the content of the private member's bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/referendum-question-does-not-reflect-divorce-bill-–-tonio-fenech |title=Referendum question does not reflect divorce bill – Tonio Fenech |publisher=Malta Today |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=30 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525190415/http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/referendum-question-does-not-reflect-divorce-bill-%E2%80%93-tonio-fenech |archivedate=25 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Market socialism''' is a type of [[economic system]] involving the public, [[cooperative]] or [[social ownership]] of the [[means of production]] in the framework of a [[market economy]]. Market socialism differs from [[Economic planning|non-market]] [[socialism]] in that the market mechanism is utilized for the allocation of [[capital good]]s and the means of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= O'Hara|first= Phillip |title= Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2 |publisher= [[Routledge]]|date=September 2000|isbn= 978-0415241878|page = 71|quote=Market socialism is the general designation for a number of models of economic systems. On the one hand, the market mechanism is utilized to distribute economic output, to organize production and to allocate factor inputs. On the other hand, the economic surplus accrues to society at large rather than to a class of private (capitalist) owners, through some form of collective, public or social ownership of capital.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Alan E.

Although economic proposals involving social ownership with [[Factor markets (economics)|factor markets]] have existed since the early 19th century, the term "market socialism" only emerged in the 1920s during the [[socialist calculation debate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Steele|first= David Ramsay |title= From Marx to Mises: Post Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation |publisher= Open Court|date=September 1999|isbn= 978-0875484495|page = 177|quote= It was in the early 1920s that the expression ‘market socialism’ (marktsozialismus) became commonplace.

Early models of market socialism trace their roots to the work of [[Adam Smith]] and the theories of [[classical economics]], which consisted of proposals for cooperative enterprises operating in a free-market economy. The aim of such proposals was to eliminate exploitation by allowing individuals to receive the [[To each according to his contribution|full product of their labor]] while removing the market-distorting effects of concentrating ownership and wealth in the hands of a small class of private owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= McNally|first= David |title= Against the Market: Political economy, market socialism and the Marxist critique |publisher= Verso|year= 1993|isbn= 978-0-86091-606-2|page = 44|quote=...by the 1820s, 'Smithian' apologists for industrial capitalism confronted 'Smithian' socialists in a vigorous, and often venomous, debate over political economy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among early advocates of market socialism were the [[Ricardian socialist]] economists and [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] philosophers. In the early 20th century, [[Oskar Lange]] and [[Abba Lerner]] outlined a neoclassical model of socialism which included a role for a central planning board (CPB) in setting prices equal to [[marginal cost]] to achieve [[Pareto efficiency]]. Even though these early models did not rely on genuine markets, they were labeled "market socialist" for their utilization of financial prices and calculation. In more recent models proposed by American neoclassical economists, public ownership of the means of production is achieved through public ownership of [[Equity (finance)|equity]] and social control of investment.

==Theoretical history==
{{Economic systems sidebar|by ideology}}

===Classical economics===
The key theoretical basis for market socialism is the negation of the underlying expropriation of surplus value present in other, exploitative, modes of production. Socialist theories that favored the market date back to the [[Ricardian socialism|Ricardian socialists]] and [[Anarchist economics|anarchist economists]], who advocated a free-market combined with public ownership or [[Mutualization|mutual ownership]] of the means of production.

Proponents of early market socialism include the [[Ricardian socialism|Ricardian socialist economists]], the classical liberal philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] and the anarchist philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. These models of socialism entailed "perfecting" or improving the market-mechanism and free-price system by removing distortions caused by exploitation, private property and alienated labor.

This form of market socialism has been termed "free-market socialism" because it does not involve planners.&lt;ref&gt;''Property and Prophets: the evolution of economic institutions and ideologies'', E.

==== John Stuart Mill ====
Mill's early [[Philosophy and economics|economic philosophy]] was one of [[free market]]s. Later he altered his views toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his ''Principles of Political Economy'' in defence of a socialist outlook, and defending some socialist causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Mill's ''Principles'', first published in 1848, was one of the most widely read of all books on economics in the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the case of [[Oxford University]] it was the standard text until 1919, when it was replaced by [[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Marshall's ''Principles of Economics'']].

Mill promoted substituting capitalist businesses with [[worker cooperatives]]. He says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The form of association, however, which if mankind continue to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and work-people without a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected and removable by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Principles of Political Economy with some of their Applications to Social Philosophy, IV.7.21 [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/101#Mill_0199_1342 John Stuart Mill: Political Economy, IV.7.21]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Mutualism====
[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] developed a theoretical system called [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], which attacks the legitimacy of existing [[property rights]], [[subsidies]], [[corporations]], [[banking]], and [[Renting|rent]]. Proudhon envisioned a decentralized market where people would enter the market with equal power, negating [[wage slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mutualist.blogspot.com/2006/01/eugene-plawiuk-on-anarchist-socialism.html|title=Eugene Plawiuk on Anarchist Socialism|author=Kevin Carson|date=19 January 2006|work=Mutualist Blog: Free Market Anti-Capitalism|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents believe that cooperatives, credit unions, and other forms of worker ownership would become viable without being subject to the [[Sovereign state|state]]. Market socialism has also been used to describe some [[individualist anarchist]] works&lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin, ''Ghost of Anarcho-Syndicalism''; [[Robert Graham (historian)|Robert Graham]], ''The General Idea of Proudhon's Revolution''.&lt;/ref&gt; which argue that free markets help workers and weaken capitalists.

====American anarchism====
For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster "[i]t is apparent&amp;nbsp;... that [[Proudhon]]ian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of [[Josiah Warren]] and [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]&amp;nbsp;... [[William B. Greene]] presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html |title=Native American Anarchism: A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism |author=Eunice Minette Schuster |date= |work=againstallauthority.org |accessdate=2 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214200513/http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html |archivedate=February 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josiah Warren]] is widely regarded as the first American [[anarchist]],&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;Palmer, Brian (2010-12-29) [http://www.slate.com/id/2279457/ What do anarchists want from us?], ''[[Slate.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, ''The Peaceful Revolutionist'', was the first anarchist periodical published,&lt;ref&gt;William Bailie, {{cite web|url=http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/warren/1stAmAnarch.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204155505/http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/warren/1stAmAnarch.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }} ''Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist  –  A Sociological Study'', Boston: Small, Maynard &amp; Co., 1906, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; an enterprise for which he built his own printing press, cast his own type, and made his own printing plates.&lt;ref name="bailie20"/&gt;

Warren was a follower of [[Robert Owen]] and joined Owen's community at [[New Harmony, Indiana]]. Josiah Warren termed the phrase "[[Cost the limit of price]]", with "cost" here referring not to monetary price paid but the labor one exerted to produce an item.&lt;ref&gt;"A watch has a ''cost'' and a ''value''. The COST consists of the amount of labor bestowed on the mineral or natural wealth, in converting it into metals…". Warren, Josiah. ''Equitable Commerce''&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, "[h]e proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce".&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt; He put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental "labor for labor store" called the [[Cincinnati Time Store]] where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor. The store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]. These included "[[Utopia, Ohio|Utopia]]" and "[[past and present anarchist communities#Modern Times (1851 to late 1860s)|Modern Times]]". Warren said that [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]' ''The Science of Society'', published in 1852, was the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren's own theories.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Madison. "Anarchism in the United States". ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 6, No. 1. (Jan., 1945), p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later [[Benjamin Tucker]] fused the economics of Warren and Proudhon and published these ideas in ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' calling them "Anarchistic-Socialism".&lt;ref name="Benjamin Tucker p. 404"&gt;''Benjamin Tucker. ''Instead of a Book'', p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker said: "[T]he fact that one class of men are dependent for their living upon the sale of their labour, while another class of men are relieved of the necessity of labour by being legally privileged to sell something that is not labour. . . . And to such a state of things I am as much opposed as any one. But the minute you remove privilege. . . every man will be a labourer exchanging with fellow-labourers . . . What Anarchistic-Socialism aims to abolish is usury . . . it wants to deprive capital of its reward"''.&lt;ref name="Benjamin Tucker p. 404"/&gt;''

===Neoclassical economics===

====Early 20th century====
Beginning in the early twentieth century, [[neoclassical economic theory]] provided the theoretical basis for more comprehensive models of market socialism. Early neoclassical models of socialism included a role for a central planning board (CPB) in setting prices equal [[marginal cost]] to achieve [[Pareto efficiency]]. Even though these early models did not rely on genuine markets, they were labeled "market socialist" for their utilization of financial prices and calculation. Alternative outlines for market socialism involve models where socially owned enterprises or producer co-operatives operate within [[free market]]s under the criterion of profitability. In recent models proposed by American neoclassical economists, public ownership of the means of production is achieved through public ownership of [[Equity (finance)|equity]] and social control of investment.

The earliest models of neoclassical socialism were developed by [[Leon Walras]], [[Enrico Barone]] (1908)&lt;ref&gt;F. Caffé (1987), "Barone, Enrico", ''The [[New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', {{ISBN|978-1-56159-197-8}}, v. 1, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Barone, "Il Ministro della Produzione nello Stato Collettivista", ''Giornale degli Economisti'', 2, pp. 267–93, trans. as "The Ministry of Production in the Collectivist State", in [[F. A. Hayek]], ed. (1935), ''Collectivist Economic Planning'', {{ISBN|978-0-7100-1506-8}} pp. 245–90.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oskar R. Lange]] (c. 1936).&lt;ref&gt;Robin Hahnel (2005), ''Economic Justice and Democracy'', Routlege, {{ISBN|978-0-415-93344-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=m3QMGLrRbSAC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=%22Economic+Justice+and+Democracy%22+Hahnel+%22usually+called+market+socialist+models%22&amp;ei=VoSPSp_PK5iSlQSElPirBw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 170]&lt;/ref&gt; Lange and [[Fred M. Taylor]] (1929)&lt;ref&gt;Fred M. Taylor (1929). "The Guidance of Production in a Socialist State", ''American Economic Review'', 19(1), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1809581 pp. 1–8].&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that central planning boards set prices through "trial and error", making adjustments as shortages and surpluses occurred rather than relying on a [[free price mechanism]]. If there were shortages, prices would be raised; if there were surpluses, prices would be lowered.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Skousen (2001), ''Making Modern Economics'', M.E. Sharpe, {{ISBN|978-0-7656-0479-8}},[https://books.google.com/books?id=QV2OJqbt45oC&amp;pg=PA414&amp;dq=Skousen+%22Making+of+Modern+Economics%22+%22channeled+through+a+central+planning+board%22&amp;ei=hIaPSp7dMIvKlQTO4tixBw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false pp. 414–15].&lt;/ref&gt; Raising the prices would encourage businesses to increase production, driven by their desire to increase their profits, and in doing so eliminate the shortage. Lowering the prices would encourage businesses to curtail production to prevent losses, which would eliminate the surplus. Therefore, it would be a simulation of the market mechanism, which Lange thought would be capable of effectively managing supply and demand.&lt;ref&gt;[[János Kornai]] (1992), ''The Socialist System: the political economy of communism'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-828776-6}}, p. 476.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Lange model|Lange–Lerner model]] was often labelled as "market socialism", it is better described as "market simulation" because factor markets did not exist for the allocation of capital goods. The objective of the Lange–Lerner model was explicitly to replace markets with a non-market system of resource allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Steele|first= David Ramsay |title= From Marx to Mises: Post Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation |publisher= Open Court|date=September 1999|isbn= 978-0875484495|page = 151|quote= Finally, there is the curious circumstance that Lange’s system is widely hailed as a pioneering effort in the theory of market socialism, when it is demonstrably no such thing: even the name ‘market socialism’ predates Lange, and Lange’s system is explicitly a proposal to replace the market with a non-market system.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Aslund|first= Anders |title= Market Socialism Or the Restoration of Capitalism? |publisher= Cambridge University Press|date=1992|isbn= 9780521411936|page = 20|quote= Usually Oskar Lange is regarded as the originator of the concept of market socialism, in spite of the fact that he never spoke of market socialism and would not have been the first if he had. In fact, Lange's model involves only a partial market simulation for the trial-and-error iterative construction of a central plan, which belongs to the set of decentralization procedures in central planning.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H. D. Dickinson published two articles proposing a form of market socialism: "Price Formation in a Socialist Community" (''The Economic Journal'' 1933) and "The Problems of a Socialist Economy" (''The Economic Journal'' 1934). Dickinson proposed a mathematical solution whereby the problems of a socialist economy could be solved by a central planning agency. The central agency would have the necessary statistics on the economy, as well as the capability of using statistics to direct production. The economy could be represented as a system of equations. Solution values for these equations could be used to price all goods at marginal cost and direct production. Hayek (1935) argued against the proposal to simulate markets with equations. Dickinson (1939) adopted the Lange-Taylor proposal to simulate markets through trial and error.

The Lange-Dickinson version of market socialism kept capital investment out of the market. Lange (1926 p65) insisted that a central planning board would have to set capital accumulation rates arbitrarily. Lange and Dickinson saw potential problems with bureaucratization in market socialism. According to Dickinson "the attempt to check irresponsibility will tie up managers of socialist enterprises with so much red tape and bureaucratic regulation that they will lose all initiative and independence" Dickinson 1938 p214). In the Economics of Control (1944) Abba Lerner admitted that capital investment would be politicized in market socialism.

====Late 20th century====
Economists active in the former Yugoslavia, including Czech-born [[Jaroslav Vanek]] and Croat-born [[Branko Horvat]], promoted a model of market socialism dubbed the ''Illyrian model'', where firms were socially owned by their employees and structured on [[workers' self-management]] and competed with each other in open and free markets.

American economists in the latter half of the 20th century developed models based such as "Coupon Socialism" (by the economist [[John Roemer]]) and "[[Economic Democracy#Market models|Economic Democracy]]" (by the philosopher [[David Schweickart]]).

[[Pranab Bardhan]] and [[John Roemer]] proposed a form of Market Socialism where there was a "stock market" that distributed shares of the capital stock equally among citizens. In this stock market, there is no buying or selling of stocks, which leads to negative externalities associated with a concentration of capital ownership. The Bardhan and Roemer model satisfied the main requirements of both socialism (workers own all the factors of production{{spaced ndash}}not just labour) and market economies (prices determine efficient allocation of resources). A New Zealand economist, Steven O'Donnell, expanded on the Bardhan and Roemer model and decomposed the capital function in a general equilibrium system to take account of entrepreneurial activity in market socialist economies. O'Donnell (2003) set up a model that could be used as a blueprint for transition economies, and the results suggested that although market socialist models were inherently unstable in the long term, in the short term they would provide the economic infrastructure necessary for a successful transition from planned to market economies.

In the early 21st century, the [[Marxian economist]] [[Richard D. Wolff]] refocused Marxian economics giving it a microfoundational focus. The core idea was that transition from capitalism to socialism required the reorganization of the enterprise from a top-down hierarchical capitalist model to a model where all key enterprise decisions (what, how, and where to produce and what to do with outputs) were made on a one-worker, one vote basis. Wolff called them workers self-directed enterprises (WSDEs). How they would interact with one another and with consumers was left open to democratic social decisions and could entail markets or planning or likely mixtures of both.

===Anti-equilibrium economics===
Another form of market socialism has been promoted by critics of [[central planning]] and generally, of neoclassical [[general equilibrium theory]]. The most notable of these economists were [[Alec Nove]] and [[Janos Kornai]]. In particular, Alec Nove proposed what he called feasible socialism, a mixed economy consisting of state-run enterprises, autonomous publicly owned firms, cooperatives and small-scale private enterprise operating in a market economy that included a role for macroeconomic planning.&lt;ref&gt;Feasible Socialism: Market or Plan – Or Both: http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Ratner/Feassoc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==
A number of market socialist elements have existed in various economies.

The economy of the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] is widely considered to be a model of market-based socialism, which was based on the predominance of socially-owned cooperatives, worker self-management and market allocation of capital.

Some of the economic reforms introduced by  leader of [[Czechoslovakia]] [[Alexander Dubček]] during the [[Prague Spring]] included elements of market socialism.&lt;ref&gt;''Reform Rule in Czechoslovakia: The Dubcek Era 1968-1969'', Galia Golan, Cambridge University Press, 1971, ISBN [https://books.google.com/books?id=dpROAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP2&amp;lpg=PP2&amp;dq=alexander+dubcek+reformism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JM4KTmHURJ&amp;sig=Q7aPGJNd1jXnGPTZbQo6Mmagw5Q&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVrJiejPLUAhVHrxoKHWARD3E4ChDoAQgiMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=alexander%20dubcek%20reformism&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon Cooperative Corporation]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] and [[Coop (Italy)|Coop corporation]] in [[Italy]] are widely cited as highly successful co-operative enterprises based on worker- or consumer-ownership and democratic management.

[[Peter Drucker]] described the U.S. system of regulated pension funds providing capital to financial markets as "pension fund socialism".&lt;ref&gt;''The unseen revolution: how pension fund socialism came to America'', Peter Ferdinand Drucker, Harper Collins, 1976, {{ISBN|978-0-06-011097-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William H. Simon]] characterized pension fund socialism as "a form of market socialism", concluding that it was promising but perhaps with prospects more limited than those envisioned by its enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;William H. Simon, "Prospects for Pension Fund Socialism", ''Corporate control and accountability: changing structures and the dynamics'' J McCahery, et al., Oxford University Press, 1995, ISBN [https://books.google.com/books?id=RPo4_dUeHAAC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=pension.fund.socialism.is.a.form.of.market.socialism&amp;ei=r5KPSs3wGpPOlQSSwv27Bw#v=onepage&amp;q=pension.fund.socialism.is.a.form.of.market.socialism&amp;f=false p. 167]&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[Cuba]]n economy under the rule of [[Raúl Castro]] has been described as attempting market socialist reforms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12565417 Cuba inches towards market socialism&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar policies to the market socialist proposal of a [[social dividend]] and [[Basic income guarantee|basic income]] scheme have been implemented on the basis of public ownership of natural resources in Alaska ([[Alaska Permanent Fund]]) and in Norway ([[The Government Pension Fund of Norway]]).

[[Belarus]] ruled by [[Alexander Lukashenko]] is described as market-socialist&lt;ref&gt;The Market-Socialist Country https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10611991.2016.1222209?journalCode=mpet20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to political ideologies==

===Marxism–Leninism===
The phrase "market socialism" has occasionally been used in reference to any attempt by a [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type planned economy]] to introduce market elements into its economic system. In this sense, "market socialism" was first attempted during the 1920s in the Soviet Union as the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) before being abandoned. Later, elements of "market socialism" were introduced in [[Hungary]] (where it was nicknamed "[[goulash communism]]"), [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]] (see [[Titoism]]) in the 1970s and 1980s. The contemporary [[Economy of Belarus]] has been described as a "market socialist" system. The [[Soviet Union]] attempted to introduce a market system with its [[perestroika]] reforms under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. During the later stages there was talk within top circles that the USSR should move toward a market-based socialist system.

Historically, these kinds of "market socialist" systems attempt to retain state ownership of the ''commanding heights of the economy'', such as heavy industry, energy, and infrastructure, while introducing decentralised decision making and giving local managers more freedom to make decisions and respond to market demands. Market socialist systems also allow private ownership and [[entrepreneur]]ship in the service and other secondary economic sectors. The [[Market (economics)|market]] is allowed to determine prices for consumer goods and agricultural products, and farmers are allowed to sell all or some of their products on the open market and keep some or all of the profit as an incentive to increase and improve production.

===Socialism with Chinese characteristics===
{{main|Socialism with Chinese characteristics|Socialist market economy}}

The term ''market socialism'' has been used to refer to reformed economic systems in [[Marxist–Leninist]] [[Socialist state|states]], most notably in reference to the contemporary economy of the [[People's Republic of China]], where a [[free price system]] is used for the allocation of capital goods in both the state and private sectors. However, Chinese political and economic proponents of the "[[socialist market economy]]" do not consider it to be a form of market socialism in the neoclassical sense&lt;ref name=Duan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nodo50.org/cubasigloXXI/congreso06/conf3_zhonquiao.pdf|format=pdf|title=Market Economy and Socialist Road|author=Duan Zhongqiao|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many Western economists and political scientists question the degree to which this model constitutes a form of market socialism, often preferring to describe it as "[[state capitalism]]".&lt;ref name="Market socialism or Capitalism? Evidence from Chinese Financial Market Development"&gt;''Market socialism or Capitalism? Evidence from Chinese Financial Market Development, 2005'', by Du, Julan and Xu, Chenggang. April 2005. International Economic Association 2005 Round Table on Market and Socialism, April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although similar in name, market socialism differs markedly from the "[[socialist market economy]]" and "[[socialist-oriented market economy]]" models practiced in the contemporary [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]], respectively. Officially these economic systems represent market economies that are in the long-term process of transition toward socialism.&lt;ref name="links.org.au"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://links.org.au/node/14 | title=Socialism and the market: China and Vietnam compared | author= Michael Karadjis | work= | publisher=Links International Journal for Socialist Renewal | accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key differences between models of market socialism and the Chinese and Vietnamese models include the role of private investment in enterprises, the lack of a social dividend or basic income system to equitably distribute state profits among the population, and the existence and role of financial markets in the Chinese model – markets which are absent in the market socialist literature.&lt;ref name="Market socialism or Capitalism? Evidence from Chinese Financial Market Development"/&gt;

The Chinese experience with [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]] is frequently referred to as a "socialist market economy" where the "commanding heights" are state-owned, but a substantial portion of both the state and private sectors of economy are governed by free market practices, including a stock exchange for trading equity, and the utilization of indirect macroeconomic market mechanisms (i.e. [[fiscal policy|fiscal]], [[monetary policy|monetary]] and [[Industrial policies]]) to influence the economy in the same manner governments affect the economy in capitalist economies. The free-market is the arbitrator for most economic activity, with economic planning being relegated to macro-economic government indicative planning that does not encompass the microeconomic decision-making that is left to the individual organizations and state-owned enterprises. This model includes a significant amount of privately owned firms that operate as a business for profit, but only for consumer goods and services.&lt;ref name="adb.org"&gt;[http://www.adb.org/Documents/Events/2004/PRC_Planning_System_Reform/chow1.pdf "The Role of Planning in China's Market Economy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607083510/http://www.adb.org/Documents/Events/2004/PRC_Planning_System_Reform/chow1.pdf |date=2011-06-07 }}, presented before the "International Conference on China's Planning System Reform", March 24 and 25, 2004 in Beijing, by Prof. Gregory C. Chow, Princeton University.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Chinese system, directive planning based on mandatory output requirements and quotas were displaced by free-market mechanisms for most of the economy, including both the state and private sectors, although the government engages in [[indicative planning]] for large state enterprises.&lt;ref name="adb.org"/&gt; In comparison with the Soviet-type planned economy, the Chinese socialist market model is based on the [[corporatization]] of state institutions, transforming them into joint-stock companies. As of 2008, there were 150 state-owned corporations directly under the central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/07/08/china-enterprises-state-lead-cx_jrw_0708mckinsey.html | work=Forbes | title=Reassessing China's State-Owned Enterprises | date=July 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These state-owned corporations have been reformed and become increasingly dynamic and a major source of revenue for the state in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id%3Dfto031620081407384075 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711045431/https://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto031620081407384075 |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David A.

This economic model is defended from a [[state capitalism#Use by socialists|Leninist]] perspective, which states that a planned socialist economy can only emerge after first developing the basis for socialism through the establishment of a market economy and commodity-exchange economy, and that socialism will only emerge after this stage has exhausted its historical necessity and gradually transforms itself into socialism.&lt;ref name=Duan/&gt; Proponents of this model argue that the economic system of the former USSR and its [[Eastern bloc|satellite states]] attempted to go from a natural economy to a planned economy by decree, without passing through the necessary market economy phase of development.&lt;ref name=vn&gt;Vuong, Quan-Hoang.

===Anarchism===
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)|Left-wing market anarchism}}
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|Portrait of philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) by [[Gustave Courbet]]. Proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], and influenced many later [[individualist anarchist]] and social anarchist thinkers.]]

The French philosopher [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]] is the first person to call himself an "[[wikt:anarchist|anarchist]]", and considered among its most influential theorists. He is considered by many to be the "father of anarchism".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Guerin, ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member of the [[French Parliament]] after the [[French Revolution of 1848|revolution of 1848]], whereon he referred to himself as a "[[federalist]]".&lt;ref&gt;Binkley, Robert C. Realism and Nationalism 1852-1871. Read Books. p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; His best-known assertion is that ''[[Property is Theft!]]'', contained in his first major work, ''[[What Is Property?|What is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and Government]]''  (''Qu'est-ce que la propriété? Recherche sur le principe du droit et du gouvernement''), published in 1840. The book's publication attracted the attention of the French authorities. It also attracted the scrutiny of [[Karl Marx]], who started a correspondence with its author. The two influenced each other: they met in Paris while Marx was exiled there. Their friendship finally ended when Marx responded to Proudhon's ''[[The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty]]'' with the provocatively titled ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]''. The dispute became one of the sources of the split between the anarchist and [[Marxism|Marxian]] wings of the [[International Working Men's Association]]. Mutualism is an [[economics|economic theory]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[anarchist school of thought|school of thought]] that advocates a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mutualist.org/ |title=Introduction |publisher=Mutualist.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate, just high enough to cover administration.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David. 1987. "Mutualism." The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism is based on a [[labor theory of value]] that holds that when labor or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility".&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraph 15.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mutualism originated from the writings of philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. Mutualists oppose the idea of individuals receiving an income through loans, investments, and rent, as they believe these individuals are not laboring. Though Proudhon opposed this type of income, he expressed that he had never intended ''"''to forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I think that all these manifestations of human activity should remain free and voluntary for all: I ask for them no modifications, restrictions or suppressions, other than those which result naturally and of necessity from the universalization of the principle of reciprocity which I propose".&lt;ref&gt;''Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem'', Edited by Henry Cohen. Vanguard Press, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; Insofar as they ensure the worker's right to the full product of their labor, mutualists support [[Market (economics)|markets]] (or [[artificial market]]s) and [[property]] in the product of labor. However, they argue for conditional titles to land, whose ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called "possession"),&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Clarence Lee. [http://www.panarchy.org/swartz/mutualism.6.html What is Mutualism? VI. Land and Rent]&lt;/ref&gt; thus advocating [[personal property]], but not [[private property]].

[[Josiah Warren]] is widely regarded as the first American [[anarchist]],&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;Palmer, Brian (2010-12-29) [http://www.slate.com/id/2279457/ What do anarchists want from us?], ''[[Slate.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, ''The Peaceful Revolutionist'', was the first anarchist periodical published.&lt;ref name="bailie20"&gt;William Bailie, {{cite web|url=http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/warren/1stAmAnarch.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204155505/http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/warren/1stAmAnarch.pdf |archivedate=February 4, 2012 }} ''Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist  –  A Sociological Study'', Boston: Small, Maynard &amp; Co., 1906, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster "It is apparent...that [[Proudhon]]ian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of [[Josiah Warren]] and [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]...[[William B.

While not against the market and property he was firmly against capitalism as it was, in his eyes, a state-supported monopoly of social capital (tools, machinery, etc.) which allows owners to exploit their employees, i.e. to avoid paying workers the full value of their labour. He thought that the "labouring classes are deprived of their earnings by usury in its three forms, interest, rent and profit". Therefore, "''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' will abolish interest; it will abolish profit; it will abolish monopolistic rent; it will abolish taxation; it will abolish the exploitation of labour; it will abolish all means whereby any labourer can be deprived of any of his product". This stance puts him squarely in the libertarian socialist tradition and, unsurprisingly, Tucker referred to himself many times as a socialist and considered his philosophy to be "[a]narchistic socialism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG5 "Benjamin Tucker: Capitalist or Anarchist"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107013451/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG5 |date=2012-01-07 }} in ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' by Various Authors&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The economic principles of Modern Socialism are a logical deduction from the principle laid down by Adam Smith in the early chapters of his "Wealth of Nations,"  –  namely, that labor is the true measure of price...Half a century or more after Smith enunciated the principle above stated, Socialism picked it up where he had dropped it, and in following it to its logical conclusions, made it the basis of a new economic philosophy...This seems to have been done independently by three different men, of three different nationalities, in three different languages: Josiah Warren, an American; Pierre J. Proudhon, a Frenchman; Karl Marx, a German Jew...That the work of this interesting trio should have been done so nearly simultaneously would seem to indicate that Socialism was in the air, and that the time was ripe and the conditions favorable for the appearance of this new school of thought...So far as priority of time is concerned, the credit seems to belong to Warren, the American,  –  a fact which should be noted by the stump orators who are so fond of declaiming against Socialism as an imported article."

[[File:BenjaminTucker.jpg|left|thumb|[[Benjamin Tucker]], American [[individualist anarchist]]]]
[[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchist]] [[Emile Armand]] shows clearly opposition to capitalism and centralized economies when he said that the individualist anarchist "inwardly he remains refractory – fatally refractory – morally, intellectually, economically (The capitalist economy and the directed economy, the speculators and the fabricators of single systems are equally repugnant to him.)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/library/emile-armand/life-activity.html |title="Anarchist Individualism as a Life and Activity" by Emile Armand |publisher=Spaz.org |date=2002-03-01 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued for a pluralistic economic logic when he said that "Here and there everything happening – here everyone receiving what they need, there each one getting whatever is needed according to their own capacity. Here, [[Gift economy|gift]] and [[barter]] – one product for another; there, exchange – product for representative value. Here, the producer is the owner of the product, there, the product is put to the possession of the collectivity".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/emile-armand-anarchist-individualism-and-amorous-comradeship#toc19 Émile Armand. ''Anarchist Individualism and Amorous Comradeship'']&lt;/ref&gt;
The Spanish individualist anarchist [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]] thought that ""capitalism is an effect of government; the disappearance of government means capitalism falls from its pedestal vertiginously...That which we call capitalism is not something else but a product of the State, within which the only thing that is being pushed forward is profit, good or badly acquired. And so to fight against capitalism is a pointless task, since be it [[State capitalism]] or Enterprise capitalism, as long as Government exists, exploiting capital will exist. The fight, but of consciousness, is against the State".&lt;ref&gt;"el capitalismo es sólo el efecto del gobierno; desaparecido el gobierno, el
capitalismo cae de su pedestal vertiginosamente.... Lo que llamamos capitalismo no es otra cosa que el producto del Estado, dentro del cual lo único que se cultiva es
la ganancia, bien o mal habida. Luchar, pues, contra el capitalismo es tarea inútil, porque sea Capitalismo de Estado
o Capitalismo de Empresa, mientras el Gobierno exista, existirá el capital que explota. La lucha, pero de conciencias,
es contra el Estado."[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt; His view on class division and [[technocracy]] are as follows "Since when no one works for another, the profiteer from wealth disappears, just as government will disappear when no one pays attention to those who learned four things at universities and from that fact they pretend to govern men. Big industrial enterprises will be transformed by men in big associations in which everyone will work and enjoy the product of their work. And from those easy as well as beautiful problems anarchism deals with and he who puts them in practice and lives them are anarchists.... The priority which without rest an anarchist must make is that in which no one has to exploit anyone, no man to no man, since that non-exploitation will lead to the limitation of property to individual needs".&lt;ref&gt;"¿La propiedad? ¡Bah! No es problema. Porque cuando nadie trabaje para nadie, el acaparador de la riqueza desaparece, como ha de desaparecer el gobierno cuando nadie haga caso a los que aprendieron cuatro cosas en las universidades y por ese sólo hecho pretenden gobernar a los hombres. Porque si en la tierra de los ciegos el tuerto es rey, en donde todos ven y juzgan y disciernen, el rey estorba. Y de lo que se trata es de que no haya reyes porque todos sean hombres. Las grandes empresas industriales las transformarán los hombres en grandes asociaciones donde todos trabajen y disfruten del producto de su trabajo. Y de esos tan sencillos como hermosos problemas trata el anarquismo y al que lo cumple y vive es al que se le llama anarquista...El hincapié que sin cansancio debe hacer el anarquista es el de que nadie debe explotar a nadie, ningún hombre a ningún hombre, porque esa no-explotación llevaría consigo la limitación de la propiedad a las necesidades individuales."[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt;

See Gary Chartier, "Advocates of Freed Markets Should Oppose Capitalism," "Free-Market Anti-Capitalism?" session, annual conference, [[Association of Private Enterprise Education]] (Cæsar's Palace, Las Vegas, NV, April 13, 2010); Gary Chartier, [http://c4ss.org/content/1738 "Advocates of Freed Markets Should Embrace 'Anti-Capitalism'"]; Gary Chartier, [http://invisiblemolotov.wordpress.com/2009/09/12/socialist-ends-market-means/ ''Socialist Ends, Market Means: Five Essays'']. Cp. Tucker, "Socialism."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-corporatism|anti-corporatist]], anti-hierarchical, pro-labor positions in economics; [[anti-imperialism]] in foreign policy; and thoroughly liberal or radical views regarding such cultural issues as gender, sexuality, and race.

The genealogy of contemporary market-oriented left-libertarianism – sometimes labeled "left-wing market anarchism"&lt;ref&gt;Chris Sciabarra is the only scholar associated with this school of left-libertarianism who is skeptical about anarchism; see Sciabarra's ''Total Freedom''&lt;/ref&gt; – overlaps to a significant degree with that of [[Left-libertarianism#The Steiner-Vallentyne school|Steiner–Vallentyne left-libertarianism]] as the roots of that tradition are sketched in the book ''The Origins of Left-Libertarianism''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Vallentyne]] and [[Hillel Steiner]]. ''The origins of Left Libertarianism''. Palgrave. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Carson–Long-style left-libertarianism is rooted in 19th-century [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and in the work of figures such as [[Thomas Hodgskin]] and the [[individualist anarchist]]s [[Benjamin Tucker]] and [[Lysander Spooner]]. While with notable exceptions market-oriented libertarians after Tucker tended to ally with the political right, relationships between such libertarians and the [[New Left]] thrived in the 1960s, laying the groundwork for modern left-wing market anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Roderick T. (2006). "[https://mises.org/daily/2099 Rothbard's 'Left and Right': Forty Years Later]."  Rothbard Memorial Lecture, Austrian Scholars Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; Left wing market anarchism identifies with [[left-libertarianism]] (or left-wing libertarianism)&lt;ref name="leftlib"&gt;Related, arguably synonymous, terms include ''libertarianism'', ''left-wing libertarianism'', ''egalitarian-libertarianism'', and ''libertarian socialism''.

By early 1979, the MEK had organized themselves and recreated armed cells, especially in Tehran. The MEK (together with other guerilla organizations) helped overthrow the Pahlavi regime. The correspondents for ''Le Monde'' reported that "In the course of two decisive and dramatic days, the guerilla organizations, both Marxist and non-Marxist, had managed to bring down the Pahlavi monarchy." ''Ayandegan'', the independent mass-circulation daily, wrote that it had been predominantly the Feda'iyan and the MEK that had defeated the Imperial Guards. ''Kayhan'', the mass-circulation evening paper, said that the MEK, the Feda'iyan and other left-wing guerillas had played the decisive role in the final battles of 11 February. The first person to speak at length on national television immediately after the revolution was the father of three killed members of MEK, Khalilollah Rezai. One of the first persons to address Iran on Radio Tehran was a MEK spokesman who congratulated the country for the revolution and hailed 'His highness Ayatollah Khomeini as a glorious fighter (mojahed)'. The MEK had managed to emerge from the underground onto the public arena. Although it would soon enter into conflict with Khomeini.&lt;ref name="ri"/&gt;

Allied with [[President of Iran|President]] [[Abolhassan Banisadr]], the group clashed with the ruling [[Islamic Republican Party]] while avoiding direct and open criticism of Khomeini until June 1981, when they declared war against the [[Government of Islamic Republic of Iran]] and initiated a number of bombings and assassinations targeting the clerical leadership.&lt;ref name="DUP"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ideology and Power in the Middle East: Studies in Honor of George Lenczowski|author=Peter J.

The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran was founded on 5 September 1965 by six former members of the Liberation or [[Freedom Movement of Iran]], students at Tehran University, including Mohammad Hanifnejad, Saied Mohsen and Ali-Asghar Badizadegan. The MEK offered a "a modern, democratic interpretation of Islam, with a decidedly nationalist political perspective". This differed from other opposition groups during this time, which including nationalists, Marxists, and fundamentalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Iran's National Security Doctrine|p=86|publisher=Troubador Publishers|year=2013|author=Manshour Varasteh |isbn= 978-1780885575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MEK opposed the rule of Shah, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], considering him corrupt and oppressive, and considered the Liberation Movement too moderate and ineffective.{{Sfn |Abrahamian |1982 |p=489}} Although the MEK are often regarded as devotees of Ali Shariati, in fact, their pronouncements preceded Shariati's, and they continued to echo each other throughout the late 1960s and the early 1970s.{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1989|pp=81–126}}

In its first five years, the group primarily engaged in ideological work.{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=88}} According to historian Ervand Abrahamian, their thinking aligned with what was a common tendency in Iran at the time&amp;nbsp;– a kind of [[Political radicalism|radical]], [[political Islam]] based on a [[Marxist]] reading of history and politics. The group's main source of inspiration was the Islamic text [[Nahj al-Balagha]] (a collection of analyses and aphorisms attributed to [[Imam Ali]]). Despite some describing a Marxist influence, the group never used the terms "socialist" or "communist" to describe themselves. systematically a radical interpretation of Shii Islam. During the 1970s, the MEK propagated radical Islam through some of [[Ali Shariati]]'s works (as opposed to their own prints, which were banned in Iran at the time). The MEK (and Shariati) claimed that Islam should oppose feudalism and capitalism; should eradicate inhumane practices; should treat all as equal citizens, and should socialize the means of production.{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1989|pp=81–126}} The MEK generously adopted elements of [[Marxism]] in order to update and modernize their interpretation of radical Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Maziar Behrooz, ''Rebels With A Cause: The Failure of the Left in Iran'', page vi&lt;/ref&gt;

During August–September 1971, [[SAVAK]] managed to strike a great blow to the MEK, arresting many members and executing the senior members including its co-founders.&lt;ref name="Ḥaqšenās"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title =COMMUNISM iii.

Some surviving members restructured the group by replacing the central cadre with a three-man [[central committee]]. Each of the three central committee members led a separate branch of the organization with their [[Clandestine cell system|cells]] independently storing their own weapons and recruiting new members.{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1992|p=136}} Two of the original central committee members were replaced in 1972 and 1973, and the replacing members were in charge of leading the organization until the internal purge of 1975.&lt;ref name="Ḥaqšenās" /&gt;

On 30 November 1970 a failed attempt was made to kidnap the U.S. Ambassador to Iran, [[Douglas MacArthur II]]. MEK gunmen ambushed MacArthur's limousine while he and his wife were en route their house. Shots were fired at the vehicle and a hatchet was hurled through the rear window, however MacArthur remained unharmed. On 9 February 1979, four of the assailants were sentenced to life imprisonment for acts of terrorism and sixteen other received confinements up to ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Newton|first=Michael|title=The Encyclopedia of Kidnappings|entry=MacArthur, Douglas II (Intended victim)|date=2002|isbn=9781438129884|series=Facts on File Crime Library|page=178|publisher=Infobase Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Abedin |first1=Mahan |title=Mojahedin-e-Khalq: Saddam's Iranian Allies - Jamestown |url=https://jamestown.org/program/mojahedin-e-khalq-saddams-iranian-allies/ |website=Jamestown Foundation |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By August 1971, the MEK’s Central Committee included Reza Rezai, Kazem Zolanvar, and Brahram Aram. Up until the death of the then leader of the MEK in June 1973, Reza Rezai, there was no doubt about the group’s Islamic identity. &lt;ref name="Vahabzadeh"/&gt;

===Schism (1971-1979)===

Although the Muslim MEK had rejected recruiting Marxists, the death and imprisonment of its leaders from 1971 to 1973 led to the inclusion of Marxist members to its Central Committee. In 1972, Zolanvar’s arrest led to the inclusion of Majid Sharif Vaquefi; and in 1973, Taqi Sahram replaced Rezai after his death. Reforms within the group started at this time, with Taghi Shahram, Hossein Rohani, and Torab Haqshenas playing key roles in creating the Marxist-Leninist MEK that would later become [[Peykar]]. By early 1972, Shah security forces had shattered the MEK, with most members being executed, killed, or imprisoned. The organization’s leader, Massoud Rajavi, was also held in prison until January 1979. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mujahedin-E Khalq (MEK) Shackled by a Twisted History|author= Lincoln P. Bloomfield Jr. |year=2013|publisher=University of Baltimore College of Public Affairs|isbn=978-0615783840|pages=15-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1973, the members of the Marxist-Leninist MEK launched an “internal ideological struggle”. Members that did not convert to Marxism were expelled or reported to SAVAK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vahabzadeh|first1=Peyman|title=Guerrilla Odyssey: Modernization, Secularism, Democracy, and the Fadai Period of National Liberation In Iran, 1971–1979|date=2010|publisher=Syracuse University Press|pages=167–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new group adopted a Marxist, more secular and extremist identity. These members appropriated the MEK name, and in a book entitled ''Manifesto on Ideological Issues'', the central leadership declared "that after ten years of secret existence, four years of armed struggle, and two years of intense ideological rethinking, they had reached the conclusion that Marxism, not Islam, was the true revolutionary philosophy."{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1982|p=493}}

This led to two rival Mujahedin, each with its own publication, its own organization, and its own activities.{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1982|pp=493–4}} The new group was known initially as the Mujahedin M.L. (Marxist-Lenninist). A few months before the Iranian Revolution the majority of the Marxist Mujahedin renamed themselves "[[Peykar]]" (Organization of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class) on 7 December 1978 (16&amp;nbsp;Azar, 1357). This name derived from the "[[League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class]]", which was a left-wing group in Saint Petersburg, founded by [[Vladimir Lenin]] in the autumn of 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Tortured Confessions'', University of California Press (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;151&lt;/ref&gt; Later during the Iranian revolution, [[Peykar]] merged with some Maoist groups{{which|which groups|date=October 2018}}.{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1989|p=144-145}} From 1973 to 1979, the Muslim MEK survived partly in the provinces but mainly in prisons, particularly Qasr Prison where Massoud Rajavi was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ervand |last=Abrahamian |title=Radical Islam: The Iranian Mojahedin |publisher=I.B. Tauris|year=1989|isbn=978-1-85043-077-3|pages=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group conducted several assassinations of U.S. military personnel and civilians working in Iran during the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chapter 6 -- Terrorist Organizations |url=https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2006/82738.htm |website=www.state.gov |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Combs |first1=Cindy C. |last2=Slann |first2=Martin W. |title=Encyclopedia of Terrorism, Revised Edition |date=2009 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=9781438110196 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7fT0BQxwDsC&amp;pg=PA188 |accessdate=11 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1973 and 1975, the Marxist-Leninist MEK increased their armed operations in Iran. In 1973 they engaged in two street battles with Tehran police. Also in 1973 they bombed ten buildings including Plan Organization, Pan-American Airlines, Shell Oil Company, Hotel International, Radio City Cinema, and an export company owned by a Baha’i businessman. In February 1974 they launched an attack against a police station in Isafahan. In April 1974 they bombed the reception hall, Oman Bank, gates of the British embassy, and offices o Pan-Americal Oil company in protest of the Sultan of Oman’s state visit. A communiqué by the organization declared that the actions had been to show solidarity with the people of Dhofar. On 19 April 1974, they attempted to bomb the SAVAK centre at Tehran University.

According to [[George Cave (CIA agent)|George Cave]], CIA's former Chief of Station in Tehran, MEK [[death squad|hit squad]] members impersonated road workers and buried an [[improvised explosive device]] under the road that Brig. Gen. Harold Price regularly used. When he was spotted, the operative detonated the bomb, destroying the vehicle and crippling Price for the rest of his life.

In May 11, 1976, the Washington Post reported that in January of that year, “nine terrorists convicted of murdering the three American colonels… were executed.

In 2005, the Department of State also attributed the assasinations of Americans in Iran to [[Peykar]]. The Country Reports issued on April 2006 stated that "A Marxist element of the MEK murdered several of the Shah´s US security advisers prior to the Islamic Revolution". According to [[Lincoln P.

The MEK also blames a Marxist splinter [[Peykar]] for these Americans killed in Iran. While in prison, after learning of these events, [[Massoud Rajavi]] wrote a book referring to [[Peykar]] as "pseudo-leftists opportunists" whose military operations had killed US citizens in a bid to "challenge" and outmaneuver the "genuine" MEK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mujahedin-E Khalq (MEK) Shackled by a Twisted History|p=18-9|publisher=University of Baltimore College of Public Affairs |year=2013|author1= Lincoln P.

==="The political phase" (1979–1981)===
After the Islamic Revolution, the MEK grew quickly, becoming "a major force in Iranian politics" and considered by many foreign diplomats as "the largest, the best disciplined and the most heavily armed of all the opposition organizations."&lt;ref name="auto15"/&gt;

The group supported the revolution in it's initial phases.&lt;ref name=twquarterly&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sreberny-Mohammadi|first=Annabelle|author2=Ali Mohammadi|title=Post-Revolutionary Iranian Exiles: A Study in Impotence|journal=Third World Quarterly|date=January 1987|volume=9|issue=1|pages=108–129|jstor=3991849|doi=10.1080/01436598708419964}}&lt;/ref&gt; MEK launched an unsuccessful campaign supporting total abolition of Iran's standing military, [[Islamic Republic of Iran Army]], in order to prevent a [[coup d'état]] against the system. They also claimed credit for infiltration against the [[Nojeh coup plot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zabir|first1=Sepehr|title=The Iranian military in revolution and war|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|page=125|isbn=978-0-415-61785-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the People's Mujahedin of Iran refused to participate in the referendum to ratify the constitution where [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] had called upon "all good Muslims to vote 'yes'."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As a result, Khomeini subsequently refused [[Massoud Rajavi]] and PMOI members to run in the [[Iranian presidential election, 1980]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Iran: Outlaw, Outcast, Or Normal Country?|author1=Kenneth Katzman|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|year=2001|isbn=978-1-56072-954-9|editor=Albert V.

In the immediate aftermath of the [[1979 Islamic Revolution]], the MEK was suppressed by Khomeini's revolutionary organizations and harassed by the [[Hezbollah of Iran|Hezbollahi]], who attacked meeting places, bookstores, and kiosks of the Mujahideen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakhash|first1=Saul|title=The reign of the ayatollahs|date=1990|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-06890-6|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b-7CAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=2014-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of 1981, several PMOI members and supporters went into exile.

By early 1981, Iranian authorities then closed down MEK offices, outlawed their newspapers, prohibited their demonstrations, and issued arrest warrants for the MEK leaders, forcing the organization go underground once again.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt; 

In 1981, a mass execution of political prisoners was carried out by the Islamic Republic, and the MEK fled splitting into four groups. One of the groups went underground remaining in Iran, the second group left to Kurdistan, the third group left to other countries abroad, and the remaining member were arrested, imprisoned or executed. Thereafter, the MEK took armed opposition against Khomeini's Islamic Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernard|first1=Cheryl|title=Breaking the Stalemate: The Case for Engaging the Iranian Opposition|date=2015|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0692399378 |page=109|url= |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the year 1980, clerics close to Khomeini were openly referring to the MEK as "''[[Munafiqun|monafeghin]]''", "''[[Kafir|kafer]]''", and "''elteqatigari''". The MEK, instead accused Khomeini of "monopolizing power", "hijacking the revolution", "trampling over democratic right", and "plotting to set up a fascistic one-party dictatorship".&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

In February 1980 concentrated attacks by ''hezbollahi'' pro-Khomeini militia began on the meeting places, bookstores and newsstands of Mujahideen and other leftists&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs'' (1984) p.&amp;nbsp;123.&lt;/ref&gt; driving the Left underground in Iran. Hundreds of MEK supporters and members were killed from 1979 to 1981, and some 3,000 were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3632|title=TKB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June 1981, MEK organized a peaceful demonstration in Tehran. Khomeini’s Revolutionary Guards surpressed the demonstration, which resulted in 50 deaths, 200 injured, and 1000 arrested.&lt;ref name="auto13"/&gt;

On 30 August a bomb was detonated killing the elected President [[Mohammad-Ali Rajai|Rajai]] and Premier [[Mohammad Javad Bahonar]]. A secretary of the [[Supreme National Security Council]] and active member of the Mujahedin, [[Massoud Keshmiri]], was identified as the perpetrator.&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt; The reaction to both bombings was intense with many arrests and executions of Mujahedin and other leftist groups, but "assassinations of leading officials and active supporters of the government by the Mujahedin were to continue for the next year or two."{{Sfn|Moin|2001|p=243}}

According to Ervand Abrahamian, the MEK attacked the regime for "disrupting rallies and meetings, banning newspapers and burning down bookstores, rigging elections and closing down Universities; kidnapping imprisoning, and torturing political activists; reviving [[SAVAK]] and using the tribunals to terrorize their opponents, and engineering the American hostage crises to impose on the nation the ‘medieval’ concept of the velayat-e faqih."&lt;ref name="auto18"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piazza|first1=James A.|date=October 1994|title=The Democratic Islamic Republic of Iran in Exile|journal=Digest of Middle East Studies|volume=3|issue=4|pages=14|doi=10.1111/j.1949-3606.1994.tb00535.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Iraqi invasion of Iran]] in 1980, MEK called [[Saddam Hussein]] an "aggressor" and a "[[dictator]]".&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt;

In 1981, the MEK formed the [[National Council of Resistance of Iran]] (NCRI) with the stated goal of uniting the opposition to the Iranian government under one [[umbrella organization]]. The MEK says that in the past 25 years, the NCRI has evolved into a 540-member parliament-in-exile, with a specific platform that emphasizes [[free elections]], [[gender equality]] and equal rights for ethnic and religious minorities. The MEK claims that it also advocates a free-market economy and supports peace in the Middle East. However, the [[FBI]] claims that the NCRI "is not a separate organization, but is instead, and has been, an integral part of the [MEK] at all relevant times" and that the NCRI is "the political branch" of the MEK, rather than vice versa. Although the MEK is today the main organization of the NCRI, the latter previously hosted other organizations, such as the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran]].&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt;

The foundation of the [[National Council of Resistance of Iran]] (NCRI) and the MEK´s participation in it allowed Rajavi to assume the position of chairman of the resistance to the Islamic Republic. Because other opposition groups were banned from legal political process and forced underground, the MEK´s coalition build among these movements allowed for the construction of a legitimate opposition to the Islamic Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piazza|first1=James A.|date=October 1994|title=The Democratic Islamic Republic of Iran in Exile|journal=Digest of Middle East Studies|volume=3|issue=4|pages=13–14|doi=10.1111/j.1949-3606.1994.tb00535.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many MEK sympathizers or middle-level organizers were detained and executed after June 1981. The MEK claims that over 100,000 of its members have been killed and 150,000 imprisoned by the regime, but there is no way to independently confirm these figures.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Ambassador Lincoln Bloomfield describes this period in an article in The National Interest Magazine "when confronted with growing resistance in the spring of 1981 to the restrictive new order that culminated in massive pro-democracy demonstrations across the country invoked by MEK leader Massoud Rajavi on June 20, Khomeini's reign was secured at gunpoint with brute force, driving Iran's first and only freely elected president, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, underground and into permanent exile. This fateful episode was described by Ervand Abrahamian as a "reign of terror"; Marvin Zonis called it "a campaign of mass slaughter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/what-washington-doesnt-get-about-iran-16411?page=show|title=What Washington Doesn't Get about Iran|last=Sepehrrad|first=Lincoln P. Bloomfield Jr., Ramesh|newspaper=The National Interest|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Massoud Rajavi issued a statement shortly after it went into exile. This statement, according to James Piazza, identified the MEK not as a rival for power but rather a vanguard of popular struggle:&lt;ref name="auto19"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piazza|first1=James A.|date=October 1994|title=The Democratic Islamic Republic of Iran in Exile|journal=Digest of Middle East Studies|volume=3|issue=4|pages=9–43|doi=10.1111/j.1949-3606.1994.tb00535.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Our struggle against Khomeini is not the conflict between two vengeful tribes. It is the struggle of a revolutionary organisation against a totalitarian regime... This struggle, as I said, is the conflict for liberating a people; for informing and mobilizing a people in order to overthrow the usurping reaction and to build its own glorious future with its own hands| author=[[Massoud Rajavi]]}}

In 1982, the Islamic Republic cracked down MEK operations within Iran. This pre-emptive measure on the part of the regime provoked the MEK into escalating its paramilitary programs as a form of opposition.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; By June 1982, Iraqi forces had ceased military occupation of Iranian territories. [[Massoud Rajavi]] stated that "there was no longer any reason to continue the war and called for an immediate truce, launching a campaign for peace inside and outside of Iran."&lt;ref name="auto25"/&gt; 

In January 1983, then Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq [[Tariq Aziz]] and [[Massoud Rajavi]] signed a peace communique that co-outlined a peace plan "based on an agreement of mutual recognition of borders as defined by the 1975 Algiers Agreement." According to James Piazza, this peace initiative became the NCRI´s first diplomatic act as a "true government in exile."&lt;ref name="auto19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Book|last1=Varasteh |first1=Manshour|title=Understanding Iran's National Security Doctrine |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2AVR16hSwAwC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=Tariq+Aziz++Massoud+Rajavi#v=onepage&amp;q=Tariq%20Aziz%20%20Massoud%20Rajavi&amp;f=false |isbn=9781780885575|date=2013-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the meeting, Rajavi claimed that the Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, had been "the only person calling for the continuation of the [Iran-Iraq] war."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/10/world/iraqi-visits-iranian-leftist-in-paris.html|title=IRAQI VISITS IRANIAN LEFTIST IN PARIS|publisher=|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1983-01-10|last1=Times|first1=Special to the New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the majority of the MEK leadership and members fled to France, where it operated until 1985. In June 1986, France, then seeking to improve relations with Iran, expelled the MEK and the organization relocated to Iraq. MEK representatives contend that their organization had little alternative to moving to Iraq considering its aim of toppling the Iranian clerical government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Iran: The organization of Iran|title=Iran: Outlaw, Outcast, Or Normal Country?|p=101–102|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|year=2001|author1=Kenneth Katzman|editor=Albert V.

==== Operation ''Eternal Light'' and 1988 executions ====
{{Further|Operation Mersad|1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners}}
[[File:Saddam Hussein..jpg|thumb|Rajavi shaking hands with [[Saddam Hussein]]]]
In 1986, after French Prime Minister [[Jacques Chirac]] struck a deal with Tehran for the release of French hostages held prisoners by the Hezbollah in Lebanon, the MEK was forced to leave France and relocated to Iraq. Investigative journalist [[Dominique Lorentz]] has related the 1986 capture of French hostages to an alleged blackmail of France by Tehran concerning the [[Iranian nuclear program|nuclear program]].&lt;ref name="auto23"/&gt;

According to James Piazza, Khomeini intended the MEK to be exiled to an obscure location that would weaken their position. However, Iraq hastened to court the MEK "prior to its ousting". The MEK moved its base to [[Mehran]]. The [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] took an "extensive aerial bombing campaign to push the MEK from their position," and the MEK retaliated with a bombing spree.&lt;ref name="auto24"/&gt;

Near the end of the [[Iran–Iraq War|1980–88 war between Iraq and Iran]], a military force of 7,000 members of the MEK, armed and equipped by Saddam's Iraq and calling itself the National Liberation Army of Iran (NLA), went into action. On July 26, 1988, six days after Ayatollah Khomeini had announced his acceptance of the UN-brokered ceasefire resolution, the NLA advanced under heavy Iraqi air cover, crossing the Iranian border from Iraq. It seized and razed to the ground the Iranian town of [[Islamabad-e Gharb]]. As it advanced further into Iran, Iraq ceased its air support and Iranian forces cut off NLA supply lines and counterattacked under cover of fighter planes and helicopter gunships. On July 29 the NLA announced a voluntary withdrawal back to Iraq. The MEK claims it lost 1,400 dead or missing and the Islamic Republic sustained 55,000 casualties (either IRGC, Basij forces, or the army). The Islamic Republic claims to have killed 4,500 NLA during the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Hiro, Dilip, ''The Longest War'' (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;246–7&lt;/ref&gt; The operation was called ''Foroughe Javidan'' (Eternal Light) by the MEK and the counterattack [[Operation Mersad]] by the Iranian forces.

Following the operation, a large number of prisoners from the MEK, and a lesser number from other leftist opposition groups [[1988 executions of Iranian prisoners|were executed]]. The number of those executed remains a point of contention, with the numbers ranging between 1,400 and 30,000.

On the night of Saturday 18 June 1988, Iraq launched the [[Operation Forty Stars ]] with the help of the MEK. With 530 aircraft sorties and heavy use of [[Sarin|nerve gas]], they attacked to the Iranian forces in the area around Mehran, killing or wounding 3,500 and nearly destroying a Revolutionary Guard division. &lt;ref name=csis10&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/9005lessonsiraniraqii-chap10.pdf|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|title=The Lessons of Modern War – Volume II: Iran–Iraq War|chapter=The Combination of Iraqi offensives and Western intervention force Iran to accept a cease-fire: September 1987 to March 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-war Saddam era (1988–2003) ===
{{See also|1991 uprisings in Iraq}}
In the following years the MEK conducted several high-profile assassinations of political and military figures inside Iran, including [[Asadollah Lajevardi]], the former warden of the Evin prison, in 1998, and deputy chief of the [[Iranian Armed Forces]] [[General Staff]] [[Brigadier General]] [[Ali Sayyad Shirazi]], who was assassinated on the doorsteps of his house on April 10, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Combs|first1=Cindy C.|last2=Slann|first2=Martin|title=Encyclopedia of terrorism|date=2002|publisher=Facts On File|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-8160-4455-9|page=188|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7fT0BQxwDsC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1992, the MEK attacked 10 embassies, including the Iranian Mission to the United Nations in New York. Some of the attackers were armed with knives, firebombs, metal bars, sticks, and other weapons. In the various attacks, they took hostages, burned cars and buildings, and injured multiple Iranian ambassadors and embassy employees. There were additional injuries, including to police, in other locations. The MEK also caused major property damage. There were dozens of arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/06/world/iran-rebels-hit-missions-in-10-nations.html |title=Iran Rebels Hit Missions in 10 Nations |last=Mcfadden |first=Robert D. |date=April 6, 1992 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iranian [[Ministry of Intelligence (Iran)|Ministry of Intelligence]] (MOIS) cracked down on MEK activity, carrying out what a US [[Federal Research Division]], Library of Congress Report referred to as "psychological warfare."&lt;ref&gt;"Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security: A Profile." A Report Prepared by the Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, Washington, December 2012. pp. 26–28 [https://fas.org/irp/world/iran/mois-loc.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Katzman, many analysts believe that the MEK lacks sufficient strength or support to seriously challenge the Iranian government's grip on power; however the government is concerned about MEK activities such that the latter is a major target of Iran's internal security apparatus and its campaign of assassinating opponents abroad. The Iranian government is believed to be responsible for killing MEK members, [[Kazem Rajavi]] on 24 April 1990 and Mohammad-Hossein Naghdi, a NCRI representative on 6 March 1993.{{CN|date=October 2018}}

According to the [[United States Department of State]] and the Foreign Affairs group of the [[Parliament of Australia]], MEK, sheltered in Iraq by Saddam Hussein, assisted the Republican Guard in brutally suppressing the 1991 nationwide uprisings against Baathist regime.&lt;ref name="bdt45cgf112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"/&gt; [[Maryam Rajavi]] has been reported by former MEK members as having said, "Take the Kurds under your tanks, and save your bullets for the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Iranian Revolutionary Guards]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/sloth/2003-07-15.html|title=The Cult of Rajavi|website=|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5io7JmBgv?url=http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/sloth/2003-07-15.html|archivedate=August 5, 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=August 3, 2009|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2003 French arrests ====
In June 2003 French police raided the MEK's properties, including its base in [[Auvers-sur-Oise]], under the orders of anti-terrorist magistrate [[Jean-Louis Bruguière]], after suspicions that it was trying to shift its base of operations there. 160 suspected MEK members were then arrested. In response, 40 supporters began [[hunger strike]]s to protest the arrests, and ten [[Self-immolation|immolated]] themselves in various European capitals. French Interior Minister [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] declared that the MEK "recently wanted to make France its support base, notably after the intervention in Iraq", while [[:fr:Pierre de Bousquet de Florian|Pierre de Bousquet de Florian]], head of France's domestic intelligence service, claimed that the group was "transforming its [[Val d'Oise]] centre [near Paris]... into an international terrorist base".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=France investigates Iran exiles |publisher=BBC News|date=June 22, 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3010422.stm |accessdate=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police found $1.3 million in [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100 bills]] in cash in their offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/18/world/french-arrest-150-from-iranian-opposition-group.html |title=French Arrest 150 From Iranian Opposition Group |last=Sciolino |first=Elaine |date=June 18, 2003 |work=The New York Times |access-date=August 4, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 160 MEK members arrested on terror charges in France in 2003 were investigated by courts and fully exonerated in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mujahedin-E Khalq (MEK) Shackled by a Twisted History|author= Lincoln P.

U.S. Senator [[Sam Brownback]], a Republican from Kansas and chairman of the Foreign Relations subcommittee on South Asia, then accused the French of doing "the Iranian government's dirty work". Along with other members of [[United States Congress|Congress]], he wrote a letter of protest to President [[Jacques Chirac]], while longtime MEK supporters such as [[Sheila Jackson-Lee]], a Democrat from Texas, criticized Maryam Radjavi's arrest.&lt;ref name="Rubin" /&gt;

Following orders from MEK and in protest to the arrests, about ten members including [[Neda Hassani]], [[Self-immolation|set themselves on fire]] in front of French embassies abroad and two of them died. French authorities released MEK members as a result.&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt;

During the [[Iraq War]], the [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|coalition forces]] bombed MEK bases and forced them to surrender in May 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The A to Z of Middle Eastern Intelligence|isbn=978-0-8108-7070-3|authors=Ephraim Kahana, Muhammad Suwaed |year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. troops later posted guards at its bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/9158/ |title=Mujahadeen-e-Khalq (MEK) |first=Holly |last=Fletcher |date=April 8, 2008 |publisher=CFR |accessdate=2013-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606084954/http://www.cfr.org/publication/9158/ |archivedate=June 6, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. military also protected and gave logistical support to the MEK as U.S. officials viewed the group as a high value source of intelligence on Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZB9F74tiE-kC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=saddam+hussein+mek#v=onepage&amp;q=saddam%20hussein%20mek&amp;f=false |title=The United States and Iran: Sanctions, wars and the policy of dual containment |isbn=978-0-415-77396-6 |author=Fayazmanesh |first=Sasan |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

After the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], MEK camps were bombed by the U.S., resulting in at least 50 deaths. It was later revealed that the U.S. bombings were part of an agreement between the Iranian government and Washington. In the agreement Tehran offered to oust some al-Qaeda suspects if the U.S. came down on the MEK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mojtahedzadeh |first1=Hajar|title=The Real Face of Realpolitik: Camp Ashraf and the U.S. FTO|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/hajar-mojtahedzadeh/the-real-face-of-realpoli_b_892469.html|website=Huffingtonpost.com|publisher=The World Post|accessdate=1 July 2015|date=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 August 2003, MEK bombed the [[United Nations]] compound in Iraq, prompting UN withdrawal from the country.&lt;ref name="RAND" /&gt;

In 2010, Iranian authorities sentenced to death five members of the MEK who were arrested during [[2009 Iranian presidential election protests]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2010/01/ashoura-protesters-risk-execution-iran-20100108/ |title=Ashoura Protesters Risk Execution in Iran |accessdate=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, the [[Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal]] issued an arrest warrant for 39 MEK members, including Massoud and Maryam Rajavi, for [[crimes against humanity]] committed while suppressing the [[1991 uprisings in Iraq]].&lt;ref name="cah"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Muhanad Mohammed|editor=Rania El Gamal; David Stamp|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE66A0A0|title=Iraqi court seeks arrest of Iranian exiles|date=11 July 2010|access-date=28 December 2016|publisher=[[Reuters]]|newspaper=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iran's nuclear programme ====

{{See also|Iran–Israel proxy conflict}}
The MEK and the NCRI revealed the existence of [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran's nuclear program]] in a press conference held on 14 August 2002 in Washington DC. MEK representative [[Alireza Jafarzadeh]] stated that Iran is running two top-secret projects, one in the city of [[Natanz]] and another in [[IR-40|a facility located in Arak]], which was later confirmed by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;ref name="nuc"&gt;{{citation|authors=Sasan Fayazmanesh|series=Routledge Studies in Middle Eastern Politics|title=The United States and Iran: Sanctions, Wars and the Policy of Dual Containment|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-97687-3|pages=120–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists [[Seymour Hersh]] and [[Connie Bruck]] have written that the information was given to the MEK by Israel. Among others, it was described by a senior IAEA official and a monarchist advisor to [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Reza Pahlavi]], who said before MEK they were offered to reveal the information, but they refused because it would be seen negatively by the people of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Seymour Hersh|title=Chain of Command: The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2004|isbn=978-0-06-019591-5|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/03/06/exiles-6|title=Exiles: How Iran's Expatriates are Gaming the Nuclear Threat|journal=The New Yorker|author=Connie Bruck|date=6 March 2006|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar accounts could be found elsewhere by others, including comments made by US officials.&lt;ref name="nuc" /&gt;

However, all of their subsequent claims turned out to be false. For instance, on 18 November 2004, MEK representative Mohammad Mohaddessin used satellite images to falsely state that a new facility exists in northeast [[Tehran]], named "Center for the Development of Advanced Defence Technology".&lt;ref name="nuc" /&gt;

In 2010 the NCRI claimed to have uncovered a secret nuclear facility in Iran. These claims were dismissed by US officials, who did not believe the facilities to be nuclear. In 2013, the NCRI again claimed to have discovered a secret underground nuclear site.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/11/us-nuclear-iran-exiles-idUSBRE96A0KZ20130711 |title=Exiled dissidents claim Iran building new nuclear site &amp;#124; Reuters |author=Nicholas Vinocur and Fredrik Dahl|publisher=reuters.com|accessdate=2015-02-07|newspaper=Reuters |date=2013-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the MEK were accused by the Iranian government and US officials, who spoke to [[NBC News]] on condition of anonymity, of being financed, trained, and armed by [[Mossad|Israel's secret service]] to assassinate Iranian nuclear scientists.&lt;ref name="rockcenter.nbcnews.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel's Mossad Trained Assassins of Iran Nuclear Scientists, Report Says|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-s-mossad-trained-assassins-of-iran-nuclear-scientists-report-says-1.411945|accessdate=18 November 2015|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cockburn|first1=Patrick|title=Just who has been killing Iran's nuclear scientists?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/just-who-has-been-killing-irans-nuclear-scientists-8861232.html|accessdate=18 November 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former CIA [[case officer]] in the Middle East, [[Robert Baer]] argued that MEK agents trained by Israel were the only plausible perpetrators for such assassinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borger|first1=Julian|title=Who is responsible for the Iran nuclear scientists attacks?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/12/iran-nuclear-scientists-attacks|accessdate=18 November 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relocation from Iraq ====
On January 1, 2009 the U.S. military transferred control of [[Camp Ashraf]] to the Iraqi government. On the same day, Prime Minister [[Nuri al-Maliki]] announced that the militant group would not be allowed to base its operations from Iraqi soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Abigail |last=Hauslohner |title=Iranian Resistance Group a Source of Contention in Iraq |work=Time Magazine |date=January 5, 2008 |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1869532,00.html |accessdate=2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 MEK moved from Camp Ashraf to [[Camp Hurriya]] in [[Baghdad]] (a onetime U.S. base formerly known as [[Camp Liberty]]). A rocket and mortar attack killed 5 and injured 50 others at Camp Hurriya on February 9, 2013. MEK residents of the facility and their representatives and lawyers appealed to the [[UN Secretary-General]] and U.S. officials to let them return to Ashraf, which they say has concrete buildings and shelters that offer more protection.

In 2013, the United States pushed to MEK to relocate to [[Albania]], but the organization rejected the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author= Ashish Kumar Sen|title=U.S. pushes Iranian dissidents to accept Albanian asylum offer|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/18/us-iranian-dissidents-accept-albanian-asylum-offer/|work=Washington Times|date=18 March 2013|access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MEK eventually accepted to move about 3,000 members to Albania, and the U.S. donated $20 million to the U.N. refugee agency to help them resettle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Pamela Dockins|title=US Praises Albania for MEK Resettlement|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/18/us-iranian-dissidents-accept-albanian-asylum-offer/|work=VOA|date=14 February 2016|access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 September 2016, the more than 280 MEK members remaining were relocated to Albania.&lt;ref name="reuters 2016-09-09" /&gt; In May 2018, [[MSNBC]] aired never-before-seen footage of the MEK's secret base in Albania, described as a "massive military-style complex".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=On Assignment with Richard Engel|url=https://twitter.com/OARichardEngel/status/1000162744518217733|publisher=MSNBC|date=25 May 2018|access-date=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation is located in [[Manëz]], [[Durrës County]], where they have been protested by the locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Durrës locals protest MEK members' burial in local cemetery|url=http://www.tiranatimes.com/?p=137041|work=Tirana Times|date=9 May 2018|access-date=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the year before [[John R.

==== 2018 ====

As of 2018, MEK operatives are believed to be still conducting [[covert operation]]s inside Iran &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The MEK's man inside the White House|url=https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/the-mek-s-man-inside-the-white-house-1242310723567?playlist=associated|series=On Assignment with Richard Engel|work=MSNBC|date=25 May 2018|access-date=26 May 2018|author=Richard Engel}}&lt;/ref&gt; to overthrow Iran's government.&lt;ref name="Five lessons from the de-listing of MEK as a terrorist group"/&gt; [[Seymour Hersh]] reported that "some American-supported covert operations continue in Iran today," with the MEK's prime goal of removing the current Iranian government.&lt;ref name="Five lessons from the de-listing of MEK as a terrorist group"/&gt;

In January 2018, Iranian president [[Hassan Rouhani]] phoned French president [[Emmanuel Macron]], asking him to order kicking the MEK out of its base in [[Auvers-sur-Oise]], alleging that the MEK stirred up the [[2017–18 Iranian protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/rouhani-calls-on-macron-to-act-over-anti-iran-terrorists-in-france|title=Rouhani calls on Macron to act over anti-Iran 'terrorists' in France|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102215915/https://www.timesofisrael.com/rouhani-calls-on-macron-to-act-over-anti-iran-terrorists-in-france/|archivedate=2 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, [[Belgian police]] arrested a man and a woman charged with an alleged plot to bomb the MEK meeting in Paris, amidst Rouhani's state visit to Austria and Switzerland. Later an Iranian diplomat working in the Iranian embassy in Vienna was arrested in Germany, suspected of having been in contact with the two arrested in Belgium. Iran responded that the arrests were a "[[False flag|false flag ploy]]" and the two arrested in Belgium are in fact known members of the MEK.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-attacks-belgium-iran-austria/iran-says-belgium-arrests-are-a-plot-to-sabotage-rouhani-europe-visit-idUSKBN1JT1BC|title=Iran says Belgium arrests are a plot to sabotage Rouhani Europe visit|newspaper=Reuters|authors=Francois Murphy and John Irish|editor=William Maclean|date=3 July 2018|access-date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2018, the French government officially and publicly blamed Iran's Intelligence Service for the failed attack against the MEK.

== Ideology ==
=== Before the revolution ===
According to Katzman, the MEK's early ideology is a matter of dispute, while scholars generally describe the MEK's ideology as an attempt to combine "[[Islam]] with revolutionary [[Marxism]]", today the organization claims that it has always emphasized Islam, and that Marxism and Islam are incompatible. Katzman writes that their ideology "espoused the creation of a [[classless society]] that would combat world [[imperialism]], international [[Zionism]], [[colonialism]], exploitation, racism, and multinational corporations." &lt;ref name="Katzman99"/&gt;

Historian Ervand Abrahamian observed that MEK were "consciously influenced by Marxism, both [[Neo-Marxism|modern]] and [[Classical Marxism|classical]]", but they always denied being Marxists because they were aware that the term was colloquial to '[[atheistic]] materialism' among Iran's general public. The Iranian regime for the same reason was "eager to pin on the Mojahedin the labels of Islamic-Marxists and Marxist-Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radical Islam: The Iranian Mojahedin|last=Abrahamian|first=Ervand|publisher=I.B. Tauris|year=1989|isbn=978-1-85043-077-3|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Abrahamian, it was the first Iranian organization to develop systematically a modern revolutionary interpretation of Islam that "differed sharply from both the old conservative Islam of the traditional clergy and the new populist version formulated in the 1970s by Ayatollah Khomeini and his disciples."&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Radical Islam: The Iranian Mojahedin|last=Abrahamian|first=Ervand|publisher=I.B. Tauris|year=1989|isbn=978-1-85043-077-3|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James Piazza, MEK worked towards the creation, by armed popular struggle, of a society in which ethnic, gender, or class discrimination would be obliterated.&lt;ref name="auto17"/&gt;

Abrahamian said that the MEK's early ideology constituted a "combination of Muslim themes; Shii notions of martyrdom; [[Classical Marxism|classical Marxist]] theories of class struggle and historical determinism; and [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxist]] concepts of armed struggle, guerilla warfare and revolutionary heroism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ervand |last=Abrahamian |title=Radical Islam: The Iranian Mojahedin |publisher=I.B. Tauris|year=1989|isbn=978-1-85043-077-3|pages=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MEK, however, claim that this misrepresents their ideology in that Marxism and Islam are incompatible, and that the MEK has always emphasized Islam.(Katzman p.&amp;nbsp;99)

The MEK's ideology of revolutionary [[Twelver|Shiaism]] is based on an interpretation of Islam so similar to that of [[Ali Shariati]] that "many concluded" they were inspired by him. According to historian Ervand Abrahamian, it is clear that "in later years" that Shariati and "his prolific works" had "indirectly helped the Mujahedin."{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1982|p=490}}

In the group's "first major ideological work," ''Nahzat-i Husseini'' or [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]]'s Movement, authored by one of the group's founders, Ahmad Reza'i, it was argued that ''Nezam-i Towhid'' (monotheistic order) sought by the prophet Muhammad, was a commonwealth fully united not only in its worship of one God but in a classless society that strives for the common good. "Shiism, particularly Hussein's historic act of martyrdom and resistance, has both a revolutionary message and a special place in our popular culture."{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1982|p=491}}

As described by Abrahamian, one Mojahedin ideologist argued

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Reza'i further argued that the banner of revolt raised by the Shi'i [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imams]], especially [[Ali]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hassan]], and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]], was aimed against feudal landlords and exploiting merchant capitalists as well as against usurping [[Rashidun Caliphate|Caliphs]] who betrayed the ''Nezam-i-Towhid''. For Reza'i and the Mujahidin it was the duty of all muslims to continue this struggle to create a '[[classless society]]' and destroy all forms of [[capitalism]], [[despotism]], and [[imperialism]]. The Mujahidin summed up their attitude towards religion in these words: 'After years of extensive study into Islamic history and Shi'i ideology, our organization has reached the firm conclusion that Islam, especially Shi'ism, will play a major role in inspiring the masses to join the revolution. It will do so because Shi'ism, particularly [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]]'s historic act of resistance, has both a revolutionary message and a special place in our popular culture."&lt;ref&gt;Keddle, Nikki R. ''Modern Iran: Roots and Results of Revolution'', First Edition. New Haven Connecticut: Yale University Press, 2006. 220–221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== After the revolution ===

[[File:Gathering 3.jpg|thumb|MEK demonstrators carrying [[Lion and Sun]] flags and those of 'National Liberation Army of Iran']]
The MEK claims to have disassociated itself from its former revolutionary ideology in favor of liberal democratic values, however they fail to "present any track record to substantiate a capability or intention to be democratic".&lt;ref name="Terrornomics73"&gt;{{citation|title=Terrornomics|editor=David Gold|page=73|isbn=978-1-317-04590-8|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|chapter=An Analysis of the Role of the Iranian Diaspora in the Financial Support System of the ''Mujahedin-e-Khalq''|author=Mark Edmond Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kenneth Katzman, the organization publicly espouses principles that include "democracy, human rights protections, free market economics, and Middle East peace", however, some analysts dispute that are genuinely committed to what they state.&lt;ref name="Katzman99"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Iran: The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran|title=Iran: Outlaw, Outcast, Or Normal Country?|p=99|publisher=Nova Publishers|year=2001|author1=Kenneth Katzman|editor=Albert V. Benliot|isbn=978-1-56072-954-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 [[U.S. Department of State]] annual report states that their ideology is a blend of [[Marxism]], [[Islamism]] and [[feminism]].&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{citation|authors=Christopher C. Harmon, Randall G. Bowdish|title=The Terrorist Argument: Modern Advocacy and Propaganda|chapter=Advertising: The People's Mujahideen e Khalq|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2018|isbn=978-0-8157-3219-8|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Masoud Banisadr, "[l]ooking at the original official ideology of the group, one notices some sort of [[Political opportunism|ideological opportunism]] within their 'mix and match' set of beliefs".&lt;ref name="Barker" &gt;{{cite book|title=Revisionism and Diversification in New Religious Movements|author=Eileen Barker|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-06361-2|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;According to the guardian, in 1992 the state department declared that the leadership of MEK "never practices democracy within their organisation".Most Iranian people who were in communication with MEK said that the organization is not likely to be criticized by opposite opinion and power.&lt;ref name=McGreal/&gt;

=== View on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict ===
{{See also|Black September#Iranian guerillas}}
In the beginning, MEK used to criticize the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] for allying with [[Israel]] and [[Apartheid]] South Africa,{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1992|p=98}} calling them racist states and demanding cancellation of all political and economic agreements with them.{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1992|p=185}} MEK opposed [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Dennis Piszkiewicz|series=Praeger Security International|title=Terrorism's War with America: A History|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97952-2|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[anti-Zionist]].&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt;

The Central Cadre established contact with the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO), by sending emissaries to Paris, Dubai, and Qatar to meet PLO officials. In one occasion, seven leading members of MEK spent several months in the PLO camps in Jordan and Lebanon.{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1992|p=127}} On 3 August 1972, they bombed the Jordanian embassy as a means to revenge [[King Hussein]]'s unleashing his troops on the PLO in 1970.{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1992|p=140}}

After their exile, the MEK changed into an 'ally' of [[Israel]] in pursuit of its ideological [[Political opportunism|opportunism]].&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authors=Thomas Juneau, Sam Razavi|series=Routledge Studies in Middle Eastern Politics|title=Iranian Foreign Policy Since 2001: Alone in the World|year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-01389-9|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MEK leader [[Maryam Rajavi]] publicly met with the [[President of the State of Palestine]], [[Mahmoud Abbas]] on 30 July 2016 in Paris, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Abbas-MEK meeting made waves everywhere but Palestine|url=http://al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/08/meeting-abbas-iran-opposition-rajavi.html|author=Marian Houk|date=9 August 2016|access-date=5 December 2016|publisher=Al-Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== View on the United States ===
Before their exile, the MEK preached "[[anti-imperialism]]" both before and after revolution. The Mojahedin Organization praised writers such as [[Jalal Al-e-Ahmad|Al-e Ahmad]], [[Gholam-Hossein Sa'edi|Saedi]] and [[Shariati]] for being "anti-imperialist".{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1992|p=229}} Rajavi in his presidential campaign after revolution used to warn against what he called the "imperialist danger".{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1992|p=197}} The matter was so fundamental to MEK that it criticized the Iranian government on that basis, accusing the Islamic Republic of "capitulation to imperialism" and being disloyal to democracy that according to [[Massoud Rajavi|Rajavi]] was the only means to "safeguard from American imperialism".{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1992|p=209}} However, after exile, Rajavi toned down the issues of [[imperialism]], [[social revolution]], and [[classless society]]. Instead he stressed on human rights and respect for "[[personal property]]",{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1992|p=245}} as opposed to "[[private property]]", which [[capitalists]] consider to be identical to "personal property" while Marxists do not.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Following the [[September 11 attacks]], the organization publicly condemned the event but its members at the camps reportedly rejoiced and called it "God's revenge on America".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Elaine Sciolino]]|title=Iranian Opposition Movement's Many Faces|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/30/world/iranian-opposition-movement-s-many-faces.html|date=30 June 2003|access-date=25 June 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organization of Iranian American Communities (OIAC) which is allied with MEK claimed that [[2018 missile strikes against Syria|US-led airstrikes]] on alleged Syrian chemical weapons facilities saved many lives.&lt;ref name="voanews001"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yazdian |first1=Payam |last2=Bahraminejad |first2=Shahram |last3=Lipin |first3=Michael |title=Iranian Opposition Groups: Syria Strikes Saved Lives |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/iranian-opposition-groups-say-syria-strikes-saved-lives/4348440.html |website=voanews |accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1993, President-elect Clinton wrote a private letter to the Massoud Rajavi, in which he set out his support for the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Tarock|title=The Superpowers' Involvement in the Iran-Iraq War |date=1998|publisher=Nova Science Publishers Inc |isbn=978-1560725930|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has also received support United States officials including [[Tom Ridge]], [[Howard Dean]], [[Michael Mukasey]], [[Louis Freeh]], [[Hugh Shelton]], [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Guiliani]], [[John R.

=== The 'ideological revolution' and the issue of women's rights ===
On 27 January 1985, [[Rajavi]] appointed [[Maryam Rajavi|Maryam Azodanlu]] as his co-equal leader. The announcement, stated that this would give women equal say within the organization and thereby 'would launch a great ideological revolution within Mojahedin, the Iranian public and the whole Muslim World'. At the time Maryam Azodanlu was known as only the younger sister of a veteran member, and the wife of [[Mehdi Abrishamchi]]. According to the announcement, Maryam Azodanlu and Mehdi Abrishamchi had recently divorced in order to facilitate this 'great revolution'. As a result, the marriage further isolated the Mojahedin and also upset some members of the organization. This was mainly because, the middle class would look at this marriage as an indecent act which to them resembled [[wife-swapping]]. (especially when Abrishamchi declared his own marriage to [[Musa Khiabani]]'s younger sister). The fact that it involved women with young children and the wives of close friends was considered a taboo in traditional Iranian culture. The effect of this incident on secularists and modern intelligentsia was equally outrageous as it dragged a private matter into the public arena. Many criticized Maryam Azodanlu's giving up her own maiden name (something most Iranian women did not do and she herself had not done in her previous marriage). They would question whether this was in line with her claims of being a staunch feminist.{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1982|p=251–253}}

According to Iranian-Armenian historian [[Ervand Abrahamian]], "the Mojahedin, despite contrary claims did not give women equal representation within their own hierarchy. The book of martyrs indicates that women formed 15 percent of the organization's rank-and-file, but only 9 percent of its leadership. To rectify this, the Mojahedin posthumously revealed some of the rank and file women martyrs especially those related to prominent figures, into leadership positions."{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1982|p=233–234}}

According to [[Country Reports on Terrorism]], in 1990 the second phase of the 'ideological revolution' was announced during which all married members were ordered to [[divorce]] and remain celibate, undertaking a vow of "eternal divorce", with the exception of Massoud and Maryam Rajavi. Shortly thereafter, all children (about 800)&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt; were separated from their parents and sent abroad to be adopted by members of the group in Europe or North America.&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Iranian Weapons of Mass Destruction: The Birth of a Regional Nuclear Arms Race?|series=Praeger Security International Series|authors=Anthony H. Cordesman, Adam C. Seitz|publisher=ABC-LIO|year=2009|isbn=978-0-313-38088-4|pages=325–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, "self-divorce" was declared as the further phase of the 'ideological revolution'. During this process all members were forced to surrender their [[individuality]] to the organization and change into "[[ant]]-like human beings", i.e. following orders by their [[instinct]].&lt;ref name="Barker" /&gt;

== Disinformation campaign against the MEK ==

According to Katzman, the Iranian regime is concerned about MEK activities and are a major target of Iran's internal security apparatus and its campaign as assassinating opponents abroad. The Iranian regime is believed to be responsible for killing NCR representative in 1993, and [[Massoud Rajavi]]'s brother in 1990. The MEK claims that in 1996 a shipment of Iranian mortars was intended for use by Iranian agents against [[Maryam Rajavi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Iran: Outlaw, Outcast, Or Normal Country?|author1=Kenneth Katzman|publisher=Nova Publishers|year=2001|isbn=978-1-56072-954-9|editor=Albert V. Benliot|p=104|chapter=Iran: The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shah’s regime waged a propaganda campaign against the MEK, accusing them "of carrying out subversive acts at the behest of their foreign patrons" and claiming that "the shot-outs and bombings caused heavy casualties among bystanders and innocent civilians, especially women and children." It also obtained "public confessions" that accused former colleagues of crimes including sexual promiscuity. The regime claimed that the MEK were "unbelievers masquerading as Muslims", and used the Koranic term "monafeqin" (hypocrites) to describe them. This label was also later used by the Islamic Republic to discredit the MEK.&lt;ref name="ri"&gt;{{cite book |first=Ervand |last=Abrahamian |title=Radical Islam: The Iranian Mojahedin |publisher=I.B. Tauris|year=1989|isbn=978-1-85043-077-3|pages=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Manshour Varasteh]], [[Ministry of Intelligence|VAVAK]] is directing and financing a misinformation campaign carried out through former opponents of the regime including the MEK.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Understanding Iran's National Security Doctrine|author =Manshour Varasteh |publisher=Troubador Publishing |year=2013|isbn=978-1780885575|pages=100| url=https://books.google.com/?id=2AVR16hSwAwC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=mojahedin+misinformation#v=onepage&amp;q=mojahedin%20misinformation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Washington Examiner]] also stated that the MEK (and [[National Council of Resistance of Iran]]) have been the constant target of smear campaigns launched and managed by the Iranian regime.

According to the [[National Council of Resistance of Iran]], in 1994 the [[Ministry of Intelligence]] (MOIS) was responsible for the bombing at the [[1994 Imam Reza shrine bomb explosion|Imam Reza shrine]] in Mashhad. The bombing killed 25 and wounded at least 70 people. The Iranian regime blamed the MEK. According to the [[National Council of Resistance of Iran | NCRI]], in a trial in November 1999, interior minister Abdullah Nouri admitted that the Iranian regime had carried out the attack in order to confront the MEK and tarnish its image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Alireza Jafarzadeh|title=The Iran Threat: President Ahmadinejad and the Coming Nuclear Crisis |year=2008|publisher= St. Martin's Griffin|page=205–6|isbn=978-0230601284 |quote="the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), composed of moderate secular muslims}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Yonah Alexander]], [[Ministry of Intelligence]] (MOIS) agents have conducted "intelligence gathering, disinformation, and subversive operations against individual regime opponents and opposition governments. ... According to European intelligence and security services, current and former MEK members, and other dissidents, these intelligence networks shadow, harass, threaten, and ultimately, attempt to lure opposition figures and their families back to Iran for prosecution."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The New Iranian Leadership: Ahmadinejad, Terrorism, Nuclear Ambition, and the Middle East (Praeger Security International)|author = Yonah Alexander, Milton Hoenig |publisher=Praeger |year=2007|isbn=978-0275996390|pages=22| url=https://books.google.com/?id=_ac30INKAu4C&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=mek+mois#v=onepage&amp;q=mek%20mois&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A December 2012 report by the US library of Congress’s Federal Research Division profiling the MOIS describes how the MOIS reruited former MEK members and “used the to launch a disinformation campaign against the MEK.”&lt;ref&gt; “Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security: A Profile”, A Report Prepared by the Federal Research Division, Library of Congress under an Interagency Agreement witht eh Combating Terroism Technical Support Ofice’s Irregular Warfare Support Program, December 2012, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; One Iranian expatriate living in Europe provided court testimony detailing his prior work as a paid agent of the MOIS, including an assignment specifically supporting “an extensive campaign to convince [[Human Rights Watch]] that PMOI [MEK] is engaged in human rights abuses” in which the agents “encouraged them [HRW] to prepare a report in this regard”.&lt;ref name="Bloomfield p38"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mujahedin-E Khalq (MEK) Shackled by a Twisted History|author= Lincoln P.

According [[Abbas Milani]], lobbyists paid for by the Iranian regime campaigned against delisting the MEK calling it a "dangerous cult"&lt;ref name="auto14"&gt;{{citation|url=https://nationalinterest.org/commentary/the-inside-story-americas-favorite-terrorist-group-5776|first=Abbas|last=Milani|title=The Inside Story of America's Favorite Terrorist Group|work=The National Interest|access-date=1 August 2018|date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, U.S. District Court charged two alleged Iran agents of "conducting covert surveillance of Israeli and Jewish facilities in the United States and collecting intelligence on Americans linked to a political organization that wants to see the current Iranian government overthrown." During the court process, it was revealed that the two alleged agents of Iran had mostly gathered information concerning activities involving the MEK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/ec9c2b547c5043938d1bdba4a4f724b9|title=2 alleged agents of Iran arrested for spying in US|work=The National Interest|access-date=1 August 2018|date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assassination of MEK members outside Iran ==

From1989 to 1993, the Islamic Republic of Iran carried out numerous assassinations of MEK members. Between March and June 1990, three MEK members were assassinated in [[Turkey]]. In 24 February 1990, Dr [[Kazem Rajavi]] (a National Council member) was assassinated in [[Geneva]]. In January 1993, an MEK member was murdered in Baghdad.&lt;ref name="auto26"/&gt;

In March 1993, the[[National Council of Resistance of Iran | NCRI]]’s spokesman was murdered in [[Italy]]. In May 1990, a MEK member was murdered in [[Cologne]]. In February 1993, a MEK member was murdered in [[Manila]]. In April 1992, a MEK member was murdered in the [[Netherlands]]. In August 1992, a MEK member was murdered in [[Karachi]]. In March 1993, two assassins on motorcycles murdered NCRI representative Mohammad Hossein Naqdi in [[Italy]]. {{cn|date=November 2018}} This led to the [[European Parliament]] issuing a condemnation of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] for political murder.&lt;ref name="auto26"/&gt;

In May 1994, Islamic Republic agents assassinated two MEK members in [[Iraq]]. In May 1995, five MEK members were assassinated in Iraq. In 1996, two MEK members were murdered in [[Turkey]] (including NCRI member Zahra Rajabi); in the same year two MEK members were killed in [[Pakistan]] and another one in Iraq.&lt;ref name="auto26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Union, Resolution on Iranian human rights violations, O.J.

=== Assassination attempts ===

In September 23 1991, an attempt was carried out to assassinate [[Massoud Rajavi]] in [[Baghdad]]. In August 1992, a MEK member was kidnapped and brought to Iran. In September 1992, MEK offices in Baghdad were broken into. In January 1993, a MEK bus was bombed without casualties. Towards the end of 1993, anonymous gunmen attacked [[Air France]] offices and the French embassy in Iran after France allowed [[Maryam Rajavi]] and 200 MEK members to enter France.&lt;ref name="auto26"/&gt;

== Ties to foreign actors ==
=== State-sponsorship ===
==== Before exile ====
By 1978, Western intelligence agencies maintained that the MEK was supported by foreign states, based on evidence of receiving funds from [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]] led by [[Muammar Gaddafi]], as well as [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], then under control of [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|Ba'athists]]. The MEK was also more remotely tied to the [[Soviet Union]] intelligence agency [[KGB]], whose connections largely related to "weapons supply, techniques, electronic training, some funding and general support", according to the informed intelligence sources talking to ''The Washington Post''.&lt;ref name="auto11"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1978/12/31/shahs-effort-to-form-new-cabinet-falters/71814083-5b54-476c-b72b-900d0a7d68c7/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.4f5a34ed959b|first=William|last=Branigin|title=Shah's Effort to Form New Cabinet Falters|work=The Washington Post|access-date=1 August 2018|date=31 December 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1979, the MEK developed ties with the KGB. There were "sufficient evidence" to assume that an alliance between KGB and Iranian Marxists including MEK was real.&lt;ref name="Chubin"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Shahram|last=Chubin|title=Gains for Soviet Policy in the Middle East|journal=International Security|volume=6|number=4|date=Spring 1982|page=139; 143|doi=10.2307/2538681|jstor=2538681}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Vladimir Kuzichkin]], a KGB officer based in Tehran between 1977 and 1982 before defecting to the [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]], the Soviet agency put officer Vladimir Fisenko in charge of direct communication with the MEK. The organization tended to avoid contacts inside Iran, despite dedicating a safe house telephone line for "emergency meetings" and mainly maintained ties to the agency via European offices. Kuzichkin says the MEK asked them for arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Vladimir|last=Kuzichkin|title=Inside the KGB: Myth and Reality|translator=Thomas B. Beattie|publisher=Pantheon Books|date=1990|pages=260–261|isbn=978-0233986166}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Abbas Milani]], In the course of a clandestine meeting, the MEK informed the Soviets that they have obtained the documents and case of Ahmad Moggarrebi, an Imperial Iranian Army general who was executed for espionage for the Soviets by the Shah's regime.&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt; The KGB headquarters in Moscow ordered Tehran station to do a document exchange immediately, offering a list of [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) agents in Iran to the group.&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt; Mohammad Reza Sa'adati, a senior MEK member who was in charge of the liaison, met with KGB's Tehran operatives three times to rehearse the exchange; and he was provided with some equipment, including a special dark glasses that allowed him to see whether he was under surveillance.&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt; But when the exchange meeting was taking place, Sa'adati and Soviets were arrested in a raid by security forces.&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt; The Iranian intelligence may have been aware of the contact because the KGB contacted MEK over the embassy phone.&lt;ref name="Milani"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Milani|first1=Abbas|title=Eminent Persians: The Men and Women who Made Modern Iran, 1941-1979|volume=1|date=2008|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, N.Y.|isbn=978-0815609070|pages=467}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Holliday (academic)|Fred Holliday]] says the event collapsed the links between the two,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Fred|last=Halliday|title=Review: The Hidden War: A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan by Artem Borovik; Inside the KGB: Myth and Reality by Vladimir Kuzichkin; Iran and the Cold War: The Azerbaijan Crisis of 1946 by Louise d'Estrange Fawcett|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=25|number=3|date=August 1993|page=508|jstor=163964}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Shahram Chubin]] argues that it contributed to prosecution of [[Tudeh Party of Iran]] as well.&lt;ref name="Chubin"/&gt;

==== After exile ====
On 7 January 1986, the MEK leaders sent a twelve-page letter to the "comrades" of [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], asking for temporary asylum and a loan of [[United States dollar|$]]300 million to continue their "revolutionary anti-imperialist" actions. It is not clear how the Soviets responded, according to Milani.&lt;ref name="auto14"/&gt; Anna Polishchuk, a student of Milani at [[Stanford University]] who made a research on [[Hoover Institution]]'s documents containing the correspondence for the first time, states that the Soviets denied the request for money but offered limited support.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://news.stanford.edu/2017/02/23/iranian-studies-program-cultivates-students-passion-history/|first=Alex|last=Shashkevich|title=Iranian Studies Program cultivates student's passion for history|work=Stanford University News|access-date=1 August 2018|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israel]]'s foreign intelligence agency [[Mossad]] maintains connections with the MEK, dating back to the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Iran's Nuclear Program and the Israeli-Iranian Rivalry in the Post Revolutionary Era|first=Farhad|last=Rezaei|first2=Ronen|last2=Cohen|journal=British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies|volume=41|number=4|year=2014|doi=10.1080/13530194.2014.942081|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyeran Jo, associate professor of [[Texas A&amp;M University]] wrote in 2015 that the MEK is supported by the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hyeran Jo|year=2015|title=Compliant Rebels: Rebel Groups and International Law in World Politics|isbn=978-1-107-11004-5|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-state actors ===
The MEK found their best friends among secular left-wing groups.{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1992|p=154}}

Its members were trained and armed by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) and [[Fatah]],&lt;ref name="cp" /&gt; with whom they "fought side by side in Jordan during the events of [[Black September]]".&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt;

The [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman]] (PFLO) and [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen|South Yemen]]'s Marxist state also provided the MEK with radio stations and printing presses.{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1992|p=154}} The MEK sent five trained members into South Yemen to fight in the [[Dhofar Rebellion]] against Omani and Iranian forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sepehr Zabir|title=The Left in Contemporary Iran (RLE Iran D)|date=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-136-81263-7|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Intelligence and operational capabilities ==
During the years MEK was based in Iraq, it was closely associated with the intelligence service ''[[Iraqi Intelligence Service|Mukhabarat]]'' (IIS),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Neela|last=Banerjee|first2=Douglas|last2=Jehjuly|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/22/world/after-the-war-intelligence-us-said-to-seek-help-of-ex-iraqi-spies-on-iran.html|title=After the War: Intelligence; U.S. Said to Seek Help of Ex-Iraqi Spies on Iran|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=1 August 2018|date=22 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=Karl R.

An unclassified report published by US Army's University of Military Intelligence in 2008, states that the MEK operates a [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|HUMINT]] network within Iran, which is "clearly a MEK core strength". It has started a debate among intelligence experts that "whether western powers should leverage this capability to better inform their own intelligence picture of the Iranian regime’s goals and intentions".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a495015.pdf|id=OMB No. 0704-0188|author=2LT Connor Norris|title=Mujahideen-e-Khalq (MEK) Part I: Genesis and Early Years|publisher=United States Army Intelligence Center, University of Military Intelligence|access-date=1 August 2018|date=27 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Rick Francona]] told ''Foreign Policy'' in 2005 that the MEK teams could work in conjunction with collection of intelligence and identifying agents. US security officials maintain that the organization has a record of exaggerating or fabricating information, according to ''Newsweek''. [[David Kay]] believes that "they’re often wrong, but occasionally they give you something".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2005/11/02/with-friends-like-these-4/|first=Erik|last=Sass|title=With Friends Like These|work=Foreign Policy|access-date=1 August 2018|date=2 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
American government sources told ''Newsweek'' in 2005 that [[United States Department of Defense|the Pentagon]] is planning to utilize MEK members as [[informant]]s or give them training as [[Spy|spies]] for use against Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.newsweek.com/looking-few-good-spies-122699?webSyncID=51731583-22e9-1495-4461-c36c6d9a1d5a&amp;sessionGUID=b77de3db-02a4-24b0-0bd2-73e5a8e044a9|first=Mark|last=Hosenball|title=With Friends Like These|work=Newsweek|access-date=1 August 2018|date=13 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MEK is able to conduct "telephone intelligence" operations effectively, i.e. gathering intelligence through making phone calls to officials and government organizations in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Ronen|last=Cohen|title=The Rise and Fall of the Mojahedin Khalq, 1987-1997: Their Survival After the Islamic Revolution and Resistance to the Islamic Republic of Iran|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-84519-270-9|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ariane M. Tabatabai, MEK's "capabilities to conduct terrorist attacks may have decreased in recent years", however, it is "suspected of having carried out [[Assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists|attacks against Iranian nuclear scientists]], with alleged support from Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Other side of the Iranian coin: Iran's counterterrorism apparatus|author=Ariane M.

== Propaganda campaign ==
From the very beginning, the MEK pursued a dual strategy of using armed struggle and [[propaganda]] to achieve its goals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Buchta|first1=Wilfried|title= Who rules Iran?: the structure of power in the Islamic Republic|publisher=The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, The Konrad Adenauer Stiftung| place=Washington DC|year=2000|isbn=978-0-944029-39-8|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its "prolific" international propaganda machine has been successful in misleading a considerable portion of the Western media since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Buchta|first1=Wilfried|title=Who rules Iran?: the structure of power in the Islamic Republic|publisher=The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, The Konrad Adenauer Stiftung|place=Washington DC|year=2000|isbn=978-0-944029-39-8|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s and the 1990s, their propaganda was mainly targeted against the officials in the establishment.&lt;ref name="BOP166"&gt;{{citation|authors=Christopher C.

The organization has made its propaganda campaign global since the beginning of the 21st century, using its "extensive overseas support structure".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|editor-last1=Ciment|editor-first1=James|title=World Terrorism: An Encyclopedia of Political Violence from Ancient Times to the Post-9/11 Era|chapter=Directory of Terrorist Groups and Individuals: Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MEK or MKO)|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-1-317-45152-5|page=859|quote=Aside from its operations inside Iran, MEK has run a global propaganda campaign since 2000. MEK has an extensive overseas support structure.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivan Sascha Sheehan conducted a [[content analysis]] research on [[opinion piece]]s of major news publications between 2003 and 2012, examining how the group promoted its [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]] in the media, concluding that "even marginalized actors who persist and strategically nurture small opportunities [e.g. MEK] can exert influence and expand the discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Ivan Sascha Sheehan|title=Challenging a Terrorist Tag in the Media: Framing the Politics of Resistance and an Iranian Opposition Group|journal=Digest of Middle East Studies|volume=22|number=2|pages=229–261|year=Fall 2013|doi=10.1111/dome.12033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher C. Harmon]] and Randall G. Bowdish, in a [[case study]] on the MEK's propaganda campaign published by the [[Brookings Institution Press]] in 2018, argue that today the organization spends an unspecified but considerable amount of their money –estimated to be in millions of Euros– annually on propaganda, in order to influence officials in various countries and "focuses its propaganda more upon audiences outside Iran than in, despite their dream of liberating that country from the current government".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authors=Christopher C. Harmon, Randall G. Bowdish|title=The Terrorist Argument: Modern Advocacy and Propaganda|chapter=Advertising: The People's Mujahideen e Khalq|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2018|isbn=978-0-8157-3219-8|pages=165–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[U.S. State Department]] work summarizes the MEK "propaganda line" roughly as follows: "[T]he Iranian government is bad, the PMOI is against the Iranian government, the Iranian government represses the PMOI, therefore, the PMOI and its leader Rajavi are good and worth of support."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editors=Lisa Parks, Shanti Kumar|title=Planet TV: A Global Television Reader|publisher=New York University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8147-6691-0|page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs|French Foreign Ministry]] condemned the group's "intense campaign of influence and [[disinformation]]" in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=France lashes out at Iranian opposition group|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-france-lashes-out-at-iranian-opposition-group-2014jun27-story.html|work=Associated Press|via=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=27 June 2014|access-date=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their propaganda aims to present them as a "democratic alternative" to the current Iranian government which defends [[Western world|Western]] values such as [[secularism]] and [[women's rights]]. It also to tries erase its history of [[anti-Zionism]] and [[anti-Americanism]], as well as [[totalitarian]] ideology and terrorist practices. As part of its public propaganda campaign, the MEK distributes numerous publications, reports, books, bulletins, and open letters to influence the media and Western parliamentarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Buchta|first1=Wilfried|title=Who rules Iran?: the structure of power in the Islamic Republic|publisher=The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, The Konrad Adenauer Stiftung| place=Washington DC|year=2000|isbn=978-0-944029-39-8|pages=114–115, 218}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Like so many politically successful violent organizations, MEK ranges widely in its public relations work", by shipping books, brochures, CDs and T-shirts with their leaders' photos to influential offices around the world they have made themselves known to newspaper offices, parliamentarians, lobbyists and government experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authors=Christopher C. Harmon, Randall G. Bowdish|title=The Terrorist Argument: Modern Advocacy and Propaganda|chapter=Advertising: The People's Mujahideen e Khalq|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2018|isbn=978-0-8157-3219-8|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of the campaign is also targeted against the MEK defectors and critics of the Rajavis inside the organization, making [[personal attacks]] against them and spreading false [[rumors]] that they collaborated with the intelligence apparatus of Iranian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Masoud Kazemzadeh|title=Islamic Fundamentalism, Feminism, and Gender Inequality in Iran Under Khomeini|publisher=University Press of America|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7618-2388-9|page=63|quote=When the democratic and progressive members of the opposition made the smallest criticisms of Rajavi, the whole PMOI propaganda machinery would commence vicious personal attacks against them and spread false rumors that they were collaborating with the fundamentalist regime's Ministry of Intelligence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media activity ===
The organization owns a free-to-air satellite [[television network]] named ''Vision of Freedom'' ([[Simaye Azadi|Sima-ye-Azadi]]), launched in 2003 in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Mehdi Semati|title=Media, Culture and Society in Iran: Living with Globalization and the Islamic State|volume=5|series= Iranian Studies|pages=99–100|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=978-1-135-98156-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It previously operated ''Vision of Resistance'' analogue television in Iraq in the 1990s, accessible in western provinces of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Summary of World Broadcasts (SWB)|chapter=Part 4: The Middle East, Africa, and Latin America|page=E-1|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation. Monitoring Service|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also had a radio station, ''Radio Iran Zamin'', that was closed down in June 1998.&lt;ref name="BIP"&gt;{{citation|authors=Christopher C. Harmon, Randall G. Bowdish|title=The Terrorist Argument: Modern Advocacy and Propaganda|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2018|isbn=978-0-8157-3219-8|pages=8–9, 12, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to buy legitimacy, MEK sometimes combines the features of the leaflet and the extended interview with purchasing usually full page, thus expensive ad space for their propaganda in major-circulation newspapers such as the ''[[New York Times]]'', the ''[[Washington Post]]'', and the ''[[Washington Times]]''. Harmon and Bowdish describe the advertisements as "well-designed" and "distinctive".&lt;ref name="BIP" /&gt;

==== Social media ====
The organization is active on social media, most notably [[Twitter]]. It runs an isolated cluster of apparently "full-time activists" and [[spambot]]s, which interact only with each other.&lt;ref name="ssrn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sm" /&gt; The cluster makes efforts to position itself as an organisation of [[human rights defender]]s. However, these efforts are rarely reciprocated, signaling their insularity.&lt;ref name="ssrn" /&gt; According to digital research by the UK-based ''Small Media Foundation'', the cluster's "dependence on [[spambot|automated bots]] to disseminate information demonstrates that although the MEK is taking social media sites seriously as a platform for broadcasting news and propaganda, they lack the supporter network necessary to make a significant impact within the Iranian Twittersphere. As a result, the MEK is making use of automated bots to artificially inflate its follower count, and create an illusion of influence amongst Iranian [[Twitter]] users".&lt;ref name="sm"&gt;{{citation|title=Ashton Talks, and the MEK Spams – Social Media Monitoring|publisher=Small Media Foundation|url=https://storify.com/smallmedia/ashton-talks-mek-spams|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161208135503/https://storify.com/smallmedia/ashton-talks-mek-spams|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 December 2016|date=24 March 2013|access-date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''National Council of Resistance of Iran'', ''Mohajedin.org'', ''Maryam-Rajavi.com'',

=== Crowd renting ===
[[File:Non-Iranian rent-a-crowd black people in PMOI rally.jpg|thumb|African-American rent-a-crowd people with People's Mujahedin of Iran banners in demonstrations in front of headquarters of the United Nations, New York City.]]
According to [[Kenneth R. Timmerman]], the group regularly organizes rent-a-crowd protests worldwide and hires [[heckler]]s.&lt;ref&gt;* {{citation|title=Hired Hecklers (MEK)|url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1487713/posts|work=[[Free Republic]]|date=19 September 2005|access-date=24 November 2016}}

In 2013 [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] published diaries of a Kyrgyz student based in Prague who was recruited to travel to Paris for a MEK rally, in which most of the "protesters" were like her.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Diary Of An MKO Rent-A-Crowd Demonstrator|url=http://www.rferl.org/a/iran-mko-ncri-rally-diary/25029410.html|work=[[RFE/RL]]|date=30 June 2013|access-date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Rubin]] has described the story as indicative of a lack of support for the MEK.&lt;ref name="Michael Rubin"&gt;{{citation|author=Michael Rubin|title=Yes, Mujahedin al-Khalq Is a Dishonest Cult|url=https://dev.commentarymagazine.com/foreign-policy/middle-east/iran/yes-mujahedin-al-khalq-is-a-dishonest-cult/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230001744/https://dev.commentarymagazine.com/foreign-policy/middle-east/iran/yes-mujahedin-al-khalq-is-a-dishonest-cult/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 December 2016|work=[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]|date=7 July 2013|access-date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Guardian]] reported that around half of the some 4,000 attendees of MEK's 2018 gathering were "bored-looking" Poles, Czechs, Slovakians, Germans and Syrians refugees, many of whom "snoozed under trees during speeches". The non-Iranians who were bussed in to the event, responded to a campaign on Facebook that promised a travel to Paris for a mere €25, food and accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Arron Merat and Julian Borger|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/30/rudy-giuliani-mek-iran-paris-rally|title=Rudy Giuliani calls for Iran regime change at rally linked to extreme group|work=The Guardian|date=30 June 2018|accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to [[Cheryl Benard]] ''et al'', despite impressiveness of the group's financial and logistical abilities, such mobilizations are unlikely and implausible because all demonstrators cannot be bought in exchange for exhausting rallies and public figures attending may face "vituperation" for supporting the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Cheryl Benard, Austin Long, Angel Rabasa and Eli Sugarman|title=Breaking the Stalemate: The Case for Engaging the Iranian Opposition|year=2015|publisher=Metis Analytics|page=115|isbn=978-0-692-39937-8|quote=Third, the organization is able to mobilize substantial support internationally. Its annual rally in Paris attracts thousands of participants every year, including major public figures. Its detractors explain this attendance through the financial incentives it alleges the participants receive and the expensive machinery of preparation (multiple bus convoys ferrying attendees from other European cities and countries, rent of a huge hall, perfect choreography of the day-long event and glamorous speakers) but even assuming this is correct, this hardly diminishes the impressiveness of the group's financial and logistical abilities, both of which are critical to effective political action. Moreover, it is unlikely that such large numbers of people would attend the rather exhausting day-long rally if they did not feel sincerely supportive of the group, or that all of the highly distinguished American and European dignitaries would compromise their reputations and subject themselves to the borderline slanderous vituperation of their critics if their support of the MEK cause were not sincerely meant. Given their biographies, positions and financial success in life, the accusation that all of these people can be bought for an airline ticket to Paris and a speaker's honorarium seems implausible}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegations of Indoctrination ===
Upon entry into the group, new members are [[indoctrinate]]d in ideology and a [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist history]] of Iran. All members are required to participate in weekly "ideologic cleansings".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Iranian Weapons of Mass Destruction: The Birth of a Regional Nuclear Arms Race?|series=Praeger Security International Series|authors=Anthony H.

=== Paid advocacy ===
MEK is known for its long-term [[lobbying]] effort, especially in the [[Lobbying in the United States|United States]],&lt;ref name="hdot" /&gt; where it competes against the [[National Iranian American Council]].&lt;ref name="adr" /&gt; It spent heavily to remove itself from the list of [[United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|Foreign Terrorist Organizations]], having paid high-profile officials upwards of $50,000 for each appearance to give speeches calling for delisting.&lt;ref name="adr"&gt;{{citation|title=The Politics and Practice of Religious Diversity: National Contexts, Global Issues|series=Routledge Advances in Sociology|authors=Andrew Dawson|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-1-317-64864-2|pages=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victoria Toensing|DiGenova &amp; Toensing]] and [[Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld]] are among the advocacy groups paid by the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Iranian Terrorist Group M.E.K.

In February 2015, ''[[The Intercept]]'' published that [[Bob Menendez]], [[John McCain]], [[Judy Chu]], [[Dana Rohrabacher]] and [[Robert Torricelli]] received campaign contributions from MEK supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/02/26/long-march-yellow/|title=Long March of the Yellow Jackets: How a One-Time Terrorist Group Prevailed on Capitol Hill|work=The Intercept|author=Ali Gharib, Eli Clifton|date=26 February 2015|access-date=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, [[Daniel Benjamin]] who held office as the [[Coordinator for Counterterrorism]] between 2009 and 2012, told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that the MEK offered him money in exchange for his support, as they try "to buy pretty much anyone".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/world/middleeast/john-bolton-regime-change-iran.html|title=M.E.K.: The Group John Bolton Wants to Rule Iran|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Nilo Tabrizy|date=7 May 2018|access-date=20 May 2018|quote=The amusing thing is that the MEK will try to buy pretty much anyone, you know.

== Human rights record ==
[[Ministry of Justice (Iraq)|Iraqi Ministry of Justice]] maintains that the MEK had committed human right abuses in the 1990s against Iraqi dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Iraq's Insurgency and the Road to Civil Conflict|author=Anthony H.

In a 2004 public release, [[Amnesty International]] stated it continues to receive reports of human rights violations carried out by the MEK against its own members.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Further Information on UA 318/03 (EUR 44/025/2003, 5 November 2003) "Disappearance" / fear for safety /forcible return New concern: fear of execution/unfair trial|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|date=20 August 2004|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/96000/mde130322004en.pdf|access-date=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) issued a report named "No Exit: Human Rights Abuses Inside the MKO Camps", describing [[prison]] camps run by the MEK and severe [[human rights violations]] committed by the group against its members, ranging from prolonged incommunicado and [[solitary confinement]] to beatings, [[verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[psychological abuse]], [[Forced confession|coerced confessions]], threats of [[execution]], and [[torture]] that in two cases led to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=No Exit: Human Rights Abuses Inside the MKO Camps|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=May 2005|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/mena/iran0505/iran0505.pdf|access-date=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report prompted a response by the MEK and four [[Members of the European Parliament|European MPs]] named "Friends of a Free Iran" (FOFI), who published a counter-report in September 2005.&lt;ref name="fofi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncr-iran.org/images/stories/advertising/ep%20report-with%20cover.pdf|format=PDF|title=People's Mojahedin of Iran – Mission report|accessdate=2006-08-29|publisher=Friends of Free Iran – European Parliament|year=2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620060931/http://ncr-iran.org/images/stories/advertising/ep%20report-with%20cover.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that HRW had "relied only on 12 hours [sic] interviews with 12 suspicious individuals", and stated that "a delegation of MEPs visited Camp Ashraf in Iraq" and "conducted impromptu inspections of the sites of alleged abuses." [[Alejo Vidal-Quadras Roca]] ([[People's Party (Spain)|PP]]), one of the [[Vice-President of the European Parliament|Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament]], alleged that Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) was the source of the evidence against the MEK.&lt;ref name="fofi" /&gt; In a letter of May 2005 to HRW, the senior US military police commander responsible for the Camp Ashraf area, Brigadier General David Phillips, who had been in charge during 2004 for the protective custody of the MEK members in the camp, disputed the alleged human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Tahar Boumedra|year=2013|title=The United Nations and Human Rights in Iraq, The Untold Story of Camp Ashraf|publisher=New Generation Publishing|isbn=978-1-909740-64-8|pages=16–23|quote=I directed my subordinate units to investigate each allegation.

Each report of torture, kidnapping and psychological depravation turned out to be unsubstantiated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Rights Watch released a statement in February 2006, stating "We have investigated with care the criticisms we received concerning the substance and methodology of the [No Exit] report, and find those criticisms to be unwarranted". It provided responses to the FOFI document, whose findings "have no relevance" to the HRW report.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Statement on Responses to Human Rights Watch Report on Abuses by the Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO)|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=14 February 2006|access-date=11 June 2017|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2006/02/14/statement-responses-human-rights-watch-report-abuses-mojahedin-e-khalq-organization?_ga=2.29931135.1513883160.1500019089-1666524046.1479911309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, the [[United Nations]] special envoy to Iraq, [[Martin Kobler]], accused the leaders the group of [[human rights abuses]], an allegation the MEK dismissed as "baseless" and "[[cover-up]]". The United Nations spokesperson defended Kobler and his allegations, stating "We regret that MEK and its supporters continue to focus on public distortions of the U.N.'s efforts to promote a peaceful, humanitarian solution on [[Camp Ashraf]] and, in particular, its highly personalized attacks on the U.N. envoy for Iraq".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-iraq-dissidents-idUSL1N0FM1UI20130716|title=U.N. envoy accuses Iran group's leaders in Iraq of rights abuses|date=16 July 2013|access-date=11 June 2017|newspaper=Reuters|author=Louis Charbonneau|editor=Mohammad Zargham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyeran Jo, in her work examining humanitarian violations of rebel groups to international law, states that MEK has not accepted [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) visits to its detention centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hyeran Jo|year=2015|title=Compliant Rebels: Rebel Groups and International Law in World Politics|isbn=978-1-107-11004-5|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fraud and money laundering ==
Other than funds provided by foreign states (such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] under [[Saddam Hussein]]), the organization raises money through [[fraud]] and [[money laundering]].&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt; According to a [[RAND Corporation]] policy conundrum, MEK supporters seek donations at public places, often showing "gruesome pictures" of [[Human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran|human rights victims in Iran]] and claiming to raise money for them but funnelling it to MEK.&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt; A 2004 report by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) states that the organization is engaged "through a complex international money laundering operation that uses accounts in Turkey, Germany, France, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates".&lt;ref name="FBI2004" /&gt;

=== French case ===
From 1981 to 1986, the MEK headquarters was placed in [[France]], then expelled to Iraq and in 2003 returned to France in order to the compound in Auvers sur Oise France. The extensive property and cash holdings of People’s Mujahideen Khalq led French police to invade the compound in June 2003. A police superintendent within the Interior Ministry’s OCLCIFF pointed to the organization’s 2003 arrival in Auvers sur Oise and the financial fraud by MEK based on ongoing observation.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

In 2003, [[French judiciary courts|French judiciary]] charged twenty-four members of the group including [[Maryam Rajavi]] for "associating with wrongdoers in relation with a terrorist undertaking", lifting the probes in 2006 except for nine members still investigated for possible money laundering. All charges including money laundering were dropped in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Irish and Chine Labbe|editor=Ralph Boulton|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-iran-ncri-idUSKBN0HC1OR20140917|title=France drops case against Iranian dissidents after 11-year probe|date=17 September 2014|access-date=28 December 2016|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
In [[Germany]], a sham charity was used by the MEK to support "asylum seekers and refugees" but the money went to MEK. Another front organization collected funds for "children whose parents had been killed in Iran" in sealed and stamped boxes placed in city centers, each taking [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 600–700 a day with 30 to 40 people used in each city for the operation. In 1988, the Nuremberg MEK front organization was uncovered by [[Federal Police (Germany)|police]], and the tactic was exposed. Initially, [[Alliance '90/The Greens|The Greens]] supported these organizations while it was unaware of their purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Terrornomics|editor=David Gold|pages=73–74|isbn=978-1-317-04590-8|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|chapter=An Analysis of the Role of the Iranian Diaspora in the Financial Support System of the ''Mujahedin-e-Khalq''|author=Mark Edmond Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2001, a joint FBI-[[Cologne]] police operation discovered what a 2004 report calls "a complex fraud scheme involving children and social benefits", involving the sister of [[Maryam Rajavi]].&lt;ref name="FBI2004"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FBI%20-%20REPORT.pdf|title=2004 MUJAHEDIN—E KHALQ (MEK) CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION|date=29 November 2004|access-date=20 December 2016|work=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[High Court]] ruled to close several MEK compounds after investigations revealed that the organization fraudulently collected between [[United States dollar|$]]5 million and $10 million in [[Welfare in Germany|social welfare benefits for children]] of its members sent to Europe.&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt;

=== The Netherlands ===
MEK operated a sham charity in the Netherlands, called "Society for Solidarity with the Iranian People" ({{lang-nl|Stichting Solidariteit met Iraanse Mensen}}) or simply SIM. In 1992, [[Wageningen]] police officers briefly arrested two SIM money-collectors for aggressive behavior. In 1993, SIM unsuccessfully tried to obtain license from the Central Bureau for Fundraising (CBF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Theo Klein|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/collectanten-beschuldigd-van-misleiden-publiek~b7b4b9c1/|title=Collectanten beschuldigd van misleiden publiek|date=9 December 1994|access-date=28 July 2018|publisher=[[Volkskrant]]|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[General Intelligence and Security Service]] (AIVD) revealed that SIM was in fact fundraising for the MEK, and its bank accounts were frozen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trouw.nl/home/stichting-wij-steunen-geen-terrorisme~af629086/|title=Stichting: Wij steunen geen terrorisme|date=20 June 2003|access-date=28 September 2016|publisher=[[Trouw]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
It operated a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based sham charity, namely "Iran Aid", which "claimed to raise money for Iranian refugees persecuted by the Islamic regime" and was later revealed to be a [[Front organization|front]] for its military wing.&lt;ref name="Terrornomics73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibtimes"&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Tovrov|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/mek-pays-us-officials-where-do-iranian-exiles-get-their-money-214388|title=MEK Pays US Officials, But Where Do The Iranian Exiles Get Their Money?|date=29 March 2012|access-date=28 September 2016|publisher=[[International Business Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]] closed it down&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=David Leigh|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/31/iran.usa|title='Tank girl' army accused of torture|date=30 May 2005|access-date=28 September 2016|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; after finding no "verifiable links between the money donated by the British public [approximately [[Pound sterling|£]]5 million annually] and charitable work in Iran."&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt;

with "providing and [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiring]] to provide material support or resources to a [[Foreign Terrorist Organization]]".&lt;ref name="Terrornomics73"/&gt;

On 19 November 2004, two front organizations called the "Iranian–American Community of Northern
Virginia" and the "Union Against Fundamentalism" organized demonstrations in front of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]] in [[Washington, DC]] and transferred funds for the demonstration, some [[United States dollar|$]]9,000 to the account of a Texas MEK member. Congress and the bank in question were not aware that the demonstrators were actually providing material support to the MEK.&lt;ref name="Terrornomics73"/&gt;

== Forgery ==
An annual report by [[California Department of Justice]] in 2004, asserts that "[m]embers of the MEK were arrested for operating a Los Angeles-based immigration and [[visa fraud]] ring, which enabled members of the group to enter the United States illegally... By using forged documents and fictitious stories of political persecution, the ring was able to assist hundreds of individuals entering the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Patrick N.

==Islamic Republic of Iran allegations against the MEK==

On 28 June 1981, a bomb detonated at the [[Islamic Republican Party]] headquarters -called [[Hafte Tir bombing]]- in [[Tehran]] killed 73, including the party's secretary-general, 4 [[Cabinet of Iran|cabinet ministers]], 10 vice ministers and 27 members of the [[Parliament of Iran]].&lt;ref name="hrq204" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronologies"&gt;{{Citation|authors=Barry Rubin, Judith Colp Rubin|title=Chronologies of Modern Terrorism|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] accused the MEK who didn't disavow their role &lt;ref name="auto27"/&gt;. Iran's security forces blamed the United States and "internal mercenaries".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=33 HIGH IRANIAN OFFICIALS DIE IN BOMBIMG AT PARTY MEETING; CHIEF JUDGE IS AMONG VICTIMS|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/29/world/33-high-iranian-officials-die-bombimg-party-meeting-chief-judge-among-victims.html|newspaper=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kenneth Katzman, "there has been much speculation among academics and observers that these bombings may have actually been planned by senior IRP leaders, to rid themselves of rivals within the IRP."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Iran: The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran|title=Iran: Outlaw, Outcast, Or Normal Country?|p=101|publisher=Nova Publishers|year=2001|author1=Kenneth Katzman|editor=Albert V. Benliot|isbn=978-1-56072-954-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ervand Abrahamian]], "whatever the truth, the Islamic Republic used the incident to wage war on the Left opposition in general and the Mojahedin in particular."&lt;ref name="auto20"/&gt;

In April 1992, Iranian authorities carried out an air raid against MEK bases in Iraq. The [[Islamic Republic Party | IRI]] claimed that the attack had been in retaliation to the MEK targeting Iranian governmental and civilian targets. The MEK and Iraq denied the allegations,  claiming that Iran had “invented this attack on its territory to cover up the bombardment of the Mojahedin bases on Iraqi territory”.&lt;ref name="auto26"/&gt;

== Status among Iranian opposition ==
According to Abrahamian, by 1989 many foreign diplomats considered MEK to be "the largest, the best disciplined, and the most heavily armed of all the opposition organizations".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;In 1994 rival exiled groups question the organizations's claim that it would hold free elections after taking power in Iran, pointing to its designation of a "[[president-elect]]" as an evidence of neglecting Iranian people.&lt;ref name="opposition" /&gt;Kenneth Katzman wrote in 2001 that the MEK is "Iran's most active opposition group".&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Iran: The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran|title=Iran: Outlaw, Outcast, Or Normal Country?|p=97|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|year=2001|author1=Kenneth Katzman|editor=Albert V. Benliot|isbn=978-1-56072-954-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 report published by the [[Brookings Institution]], concludes that the organization appears to be undemocratic and lacking popularity but maintains an operational presence in Iran, acting as a [[proxy war|proxy]] against Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Which Path to Persia?: Options for a New American Strategy toward Iran|chapter=Toppling Tehran|authors=Kenneth M.

It has no political base in the country, although it appears to have an operational presence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perception by Iranian people ===
A wide range of sources states that the MEK has little or no popular support among Iranian people. The most frequent reason cited for it, is that their alliance with [[Saddam Hussein]] during [[Iran–Iraq War]], and attacking Iranian conscripted soldiers and civilians, is viewed as [[treason]] or [[betrayal]] within the homeland. These sources include journalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Yeganeh Torbati|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-iran-opposition-idUSL1N1F610K|title=Former U.S. officials urge Trump to talk with Iranian MEK group|date=16 January 2017|access-date=20 July 2017|agency=Reuters|quote=The MEK's supporters present the group as a viable alternative to Iran's theocracy, though analysts say it is unpopular among Iranians for its past alignment with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and attacks on Iranian soldiers and civilians.|newspaper=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13447429|title=Iranian dissidents in Iraq: Where will they all go?|journal=The Economist|date=11 April 2009|access-date=15 June 2018|quote=In return, the PMOI made attacks on Iran itself, which is why Iranians of all stripes tend to regard the group as traitors.}}&lt;/ref&gt; academic works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vanguard of the Imam: Religion, Politics, and Iran's Revolutionary Guards|author=Afshon Ostovar|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-049170-3|pages=73–74|quote=Unsurprisingly, the decision to fight alongside Saddam was viewed as traitorous by the vast majority of Iranians and destroyed the MKO's standing in its homeland.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Magdalena Kirchner|title=Western Foreign Policy and the Middle East|chapter='A good investment?'

However, this claim is difficult to prove considering MEK supporters are persecuted in Iran.&lt;ref name="auto26"/&gt;  

The [[RAND Corporation]] policy conundrum on the group, suggests that between 1979 and 1981 it was the most popular dissident group in Iran, however, the former reputation is diminished to the extent that it is now "the only entity less popular" than the Iranian government.&lt;ref name="RAND" /&gt;

=== Relationship with other Iranian opposition groups ===

The group kept a friendly relationship with the only other major Iranian [[urban guerrilla]] group, the [[Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas]] (OIPFG).{{Sfn|Abrahamian|1982|p=491}}

An October 1994 report by the [[U.S. Department of State]] notes that other Iranian opposition groups do not cooperate with the organization because they view it as "undemocratic" and "tightly controlled" by its leaders.&lt;ref name="opposition"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Iran: The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran|title=Iran: Outlaw, Outcast, Or Normal Country?|p=104–105|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|year=2001|author1=Kenneth Katzman|editor=Albert V. Benliot|isbn=978-1-56072-954-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its anti-[[Mohammad Reza Shah|Shah]] stance before the revolution, the MEK is not close to [[Monarchism in Iran|monarchist opposition]] groups and [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Reza Pahlavi]], Iran's deposed crown prince.&lt;ref name="opposition" /&gt; Commenting on MEK, Pahlavi said in an interview: "I cannot imagine Iranians ever forgiving their behavior at that time [siding with Saddam Hussein's Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war]... If the choice is between this regime and the MEK, they will most likely say the mullahs."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Late Shah's Son Wants a Democratic Revolution in Iran|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-06-19/iran-s-ex-prince-pahlavi-wants-a-democratic-revolution|work=Bloomberg|date=19 June 2018|access-date=20 June 2018|author=Eli Lake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran's deposed [[President of Iran|president]], [[Abolhassan Banisadr]], ended his alliance with the group in 1984, denouncing its stance during the [[Iran–Iraq War]].&lt;ref name="opposition" /&gt;

The [[National Resistance Movement of Iran]] (NAMIR), led by [[Shapour Bakhtiar]], never maintained a friendly relationship with the MEK. In July 1981, NAMIR rejected any notion of cooperation between the two organizations and publicly condemned them in a communiqué issued following the meeting between
Iraqi Foreign Minister, [[Tareq Aziz]] and Rajavi in January 1983, as well as the "Holy and Revolutionary" nature of Rajavis in April 1984.&lt;ref name="Khonsari"&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Khonsari|first=Mehrdad|date=1995|title=The National Movement of the Iranian Resistance 1979–1991: The role of a banned opposition movement in international politics|type=Ph.D. thesis|publisher=[[London School of Economics and Political Science]]|url=http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/2837/|page=289–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, following to ceasefire between Iran and Iraq and a quarter of his follower's absence, Rajavi declared the second phase of the “Ideological Revolution”.

=== Scholarly views ===
A policy conundrum published by [[RAND Corporation]], investigating "Application of Cult Theory to the MEK", describes authoritarian and charismatic leadership, [[psychological manipulation]], intense ideological exploitation and isolation, sexual control, emotional isolation, degrading [[peer pressure]], deceptive recruitments, [[forced labor]], [[sleep deprivation]], [[physical abuse]], and lack of exit options within the group as cultic tendencies.&lt;ref name="RAND"/&gt;

Academics specializing in a wide variety of the social sciences believe that the MEK is an example of a [[cult]]. Such scholars include the following:

In 1997, the United States put the MEK on the [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations]].&lt;ref name="bdt45cgf112" /&gt; The Clinton administration reported the [[Los Angeles Times]] that “The inclusion of the People’s Mojahedin was intended as a goodwill gesture to Tehran and its newly elected president, Mohammad Khatami."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Iran's National Security Doctrine|p=93-94|publisher=Troubador Publishers|year=2013|author=Manshour Varasteh |isbn= 978-1780885575}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/22/world/middleeast/iranian-opposition-group-mek-wins-removal-from-us-terrorist-list.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=8D85BEE3471E83299CEE05AFB80B3AD7&amp;gwt=pay&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/its-time-to-lift-the-terror-tag-from-iranian-opposition-group-mek&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bdt45cgf112"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1569788,00.html|title=Iran's Armed Opposition Wins a Battle — In Court|last=Graff|first=James|date=December 14, 2006|work=Time|accessdate=April 13, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428210515/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1569788%2C00.html|archivedate=April 28, 2011|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2004 the United States also considered the group as "noncombatants" and "protected persons" under the [[Geneva Conventions]] because most members had been living in a refugee camp in Iraq for more than 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/28/politics/mek-terror-delisting/ |title=Iranian exile group removed from U.S. terror list |publisher=CNN |date=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the European Union, pressured by Washington, added MEK to its terrorist list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/amir-taheri-france-paints-an-abstract-picture-to-please-iran-1.359636 |first=Amir |last=Taheri |title=France paints an abstract picture to please Iran |newspaper=[[Gulf News]] |date=June 25, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice denied MEK its request to be delisted &lt;ref name=UPI2009/&gt;, while MEK leaders then began a lobbying campaign to be removed from the list by promoting itself as a viable opposition to the clerical in Iran.

MEK had a "strong" base in US who tried to remove the group from the U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations and consequently turning it into a legetimate actor.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; In 2011, several former senior U.S. officials, including Homeland Security Secretary [[Tom Ridge]], three former chairmen of the U.S. [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], two former directors of the [[CIA]], former commander of [[NATO]] [[Wesley Clark]], two former [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|U.S. Ambassadors to the United Nations]], the former [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[Michael Mukasey]], a former [[White House Chief of Staff]], a former commander of the [[United States Marine Corps]], former U.S. [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Frances Townsend]], and U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]'s retired National Security Adviser General [[James L.

In April 2012, [[Seymour Hersh]] reported that the U.S. [[Joint Special Operations Command]] had trained MEK operatives at a secret site in [[Nevada]] from 2005 to 2009. According to Hersh, MEK members were trained in intercepting communications, cryptography, weaponry and small unit tactics at the Nevada site until President Barack Obama took office in 2009.&lt;ref name=hersh&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.alternet.org/world/154938/seymour_hersh%3A_us_training_iranian_terrorists_in_nevada|title=Seymour Hersh: U.S. Training Iranian Terrorists in Nevada|journal=Alternet|first=Amy |last=Goodman |author-link=Amy Goodman |date=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hersh also reported additional names of former U.S. officials paid to speak in support of MEK, including former CIA directors [[James Woolsey]] and [[Porter Goss]]; New York City Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]]; former Vermont Governor [[Howard Dean]]; former [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation]] [[Louis Freeh]] and former U.N.

According to [[Alex Carlile, Baron Carlile of Berriew|Lord Alex Carlile]], the organization was put on the terrorist list "solely because the mullahs insisted on such action if there was to be any dialogue between Washington and Tehran".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/12/iran-protest-mek|title=Iran fears the MEK's influence, as its protests over terror delisting show|last=Carlile|first=Alex|date=12 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Iranian American Council]] rejects the idea, citing that the organization was listed since the [[United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations]] was established in 1997 and it was also listed on [[Patterns of Global Terrorism]] report prior to 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.niacouncil.org/site/DocServer/MEK_Factsheet.pdf|title=MEK Factsheet|work=National Iranian American Council|access-date=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Removal of the designation ===
The United Kingdom lifted the MEK's designation as a terrorist group in June 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/proscribed-terror-groups-or-organisations--2 |title=Proscribed terrorist groups or organisations |date=15 July 2016 |publisher=[[Home Office]] |format=PDF |access-date=27 September 2016 |quote=The Mujaheddin e Khalq (MeK) also known as the Peoples' Mujaheddin of Iran (PMOI) was removed from the list of proscribed groups in June 2008 as a result of judgments of the [[List of tribunals in the United Kingdom#Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission|POAC]] and the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the [[Council of the European Union]] on January 26, 2009, after what the group called a "seven-year-long legal and political battle."&lt;ref name=UPI2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Runner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters2009/&gt; It was also lifted in the United States following a decision by U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]]&lt;ref name="NYT 2012" /&gt; on September 21, 2012 and lastly in Canada on December 20, 2012.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

The US Appeals Court brief of July 16, 2010 cited the MeK’s petition arguing that more than a decade earlier, in 2001, it had ceased military operations against the Iranian regime, disbanded military units and renounced violence, and had turned over its weapons to US forces in Iraq in 2003.&lt;ref name="Bloomfield p18"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mujahedin-E Khalq (MEK) Shackled by a Twisted History|author= Lincoln P. Bloomfield Jr. |year=2013|publisher=University of Baltimore College of Public Affairs|isbn=978-0615783840|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of the European Union removed the group's terrorist designation following the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]]'s 2008 censure of France for failing to disclose new alleged evidence of the MEK's terrorism threat.&lt;ref name=Runner/&gt; Delisting allowed MEK to pursue tens of millions of dollars in frozen assets&lt;ref name=Reuters2009/&gt; and lobby in Europe for more funds. It also removed the terrorist label from MEK members at Camp Ashraf in Iraq.&lt;ref name=UPI2009/&gt;

On 28 September 2012 the U.S. State Department formally removed MEK from its official list of terrorist organizations, beating an October 1 deadline in an MEK lawsuit.&lt;ref name="NYT 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gpo.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-10-04/pdf/2012-24505.pdf|date=4 October 2012|title=Federal Register /Vol. 77, No. 193 /Thursday, October 4, 2012 /Notices 60741 10 17 CFR 200.30–3(a)(12)|accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of State Clinton said in a statement that the decision was made because the MEK had renounced violence and had cooperated in closing their Iraqi paramilitary base. An official denied that lobbying by well-known figures influenced the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Quinn |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/28/iraq-iran-mek-idUSL1E8KSF3B20120928?type=marketsNews |title=US drops Iranian MEK dissident group from terrorism list |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delisting of the Mujahedin-e Khalq|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/09/198443.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some former U.S. officials vehemently reject the new status and believe the MEK has not changed its ways.&lt;ref name="THS"&gt;{{citation|title=Terrorism and Homeland Security|author=Jonathan R.

37 individuals including [[Ervand Abrahamian]], [[Shaul Bakhash]], [[Juan Cole]] and [[Gary Sick]] among others, published "Joint Experts' Statement on the Mujahedin-e Khalq" on ''[[Financial Times]]'' voicing their concerns regarding MEK delisting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/563a29aa-c378-11e0-b163-00144feabdc0|title=Joint Experts' Statement on the Mujahedin-e Khalq|newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Iranian American Council]] denounced the decision, stating it "opens the door to Congressional funding of the M.E.K. to conduct terrorist attacks in Iran" and "makes war with Iran far more likely."&lt;ref name="NYT 2012" /&gt; Iran state television also condemned the delisting of the group, saying that the U.S. considers MEK to be "good terrorists because the U.S. is using them against Iran."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/29/iran-condemns-us-mek-terror-delisting |title=Iran condemns US for 'double standards' over MEK terror de-listing |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time, every seat in the county was held by Labour (red) after this election.{{efn|name=OMara}}]]

The '''People's Republic of South Yorkshire''' or the '''Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire''' were nicknames often given to [[South Yorkshire]] under the left-wing local governments of the 1980s, especially the [[municipal socialism|municipal socialist]] administration of [[Sheffield City Council]] led by [[David Blunkett]], used by both detractors and supporters of the councils.&lt;ref name="Municipal Socialism"&gt;{{cite book|quote=[...] local politics in Sheffield were dominated by a particular form of radical municipal socialism, gaining the city a brief but prestigious reputation as the Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire.|title=Redundant Masculinities? Employment Change and White Working Class Youth|author=Linda McDowell|year=2011|isbn=1444355597}}&lt;/ref&gt; The councils pursued a social policy radically different from that of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s national government, following more closely along the lines of [[Militant tendency]]-dominated [[Liverpool City Council]] and the [[Greater London Council]] led by [[Ken Livingstone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Payling|first=Daisy|date=2014-12-01|title=‘Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire’: Grassroots Activism and Left-Wing Solidarity in 1980s Sheffield|url=https://academic.oup.com/tcbh/article-abstract/25/4/602/1638229/Socialist-Republic-of-South-Yorkshire-Grassroots|journal=Twentieth Century British History|volume=25|issue=4|pages=602–627|doi=10.1093/tcbh/hwu001|issn=0955-2359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression was coined by Max Williams, a leader writer at the Yorkshire Evening Post, although it was soon adopted by supporters of the council's left-wing policies.&lt;ref name="Star"&gt;{{cite news|quote=The steel city - much of its steel industry wrecked under Thatcher - was at the heart of what used to be proudly called the Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire.|date=2012-08-31|title=Generations Unite|author=Peter Lazenby|newspaper=Morning Star|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/news/content/view/full/123313}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]] was the only seat in South Yorkshire where the Conservative Party was a significant political force, the remaining seats being Labour safe seats or [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]–Labour marginals.&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;{{cite book|year=1985|title=The Atlas of British Politics|page=135|quote=The Conservatives can win only one seat in the so-called "Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire".|author=Robert Waller|isbn=0709936095}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheffield City Council and the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Authority were solidly left wing, remaining [[socialist]] even as [[Thatcherism]] became the dominant political ideology in the country as a whole.

Sheffield City Council constructed large [[council estates]] with large numbers of communal blocks of flats based on the [[streets in the sky]] philosophy, including the [[Park Hill, Sheffield|Park Hill]] complex,&lt;ref name="MIS"&gt;{{cite book|page=65|title=Made in Sheffield: An Ethnography of Industrial Work and Politics|author=Massimiliano Mollona|year=2009|isbn=1845455517}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the borough councils of South Yorkshire set up an extensive network of subsidised transport under the [[South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive]].&lt;ref name="Transport"&gt;{{cite book|quote=In contrast Labour did have effective control of public transport in the metropolitan counties following the 1981 elections, and their aim, indeed the achievement of the 'Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire', was to run a cheap, efficient and extensive public transport service.|year=1991|title=The State or the market: politics and welfare in contemporary Britain|page=281|author1=Martin Loney  |author2=Robert Bocock |lastauthoramp=yes |isbn=0803986424}}&lt;/ref&gt; The councils also took more confrontational steps against the Conservative Westminster government. [[Rate-capping rebellion#Sheffield|Sheffield refused to set a budget]] in the [[rate-capping rebellion]], while South Yorkshire declared itself a [[nuclear-free zone]] and a [[demilitarized zone]].&lt;ref name="NFZ"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1983|journal=Local Government Review|volume=147|page=99|quote=Councillor Irvine Patnick, the leader of the minority Tory group on the South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council, apparently makes regular reports to the national chairman of his party and other Conservative high-ups on the situation in that beleaguered county which he refers to either as the Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire or (since the authority declared South Yorks to be a demilitarised and nuclear-free zone) Peace County.|author=Justice of the Peace Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] flew on [[Sheffield Town Hall]] on [[May Day]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/pip/mseyw/ |title=Radio 4 - Factual&amp;nbsp;— Children of the Red Flag |publisher=BBC |date=2006-10-16 |accessdate=2009-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106175739/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/pip/mseyw/ |archivedate=2012-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the city signed a [[peace treaty]] with the city of [[Donetsk]] in the [[Ukrainian SSR]], at that point on the other side of the [[Iron Curtain]].&lt;ref name="NFZ"/&gt; Both groups of policies - the practical and the symbolic - were sometimes cited as reasons for the nickname. The [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] moved to [[National Union of Mineworkers headquarters|headquarters in Sheffield]] in 1983 in the run-up to the decisive [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|1984–85 miners' strike]], and the area subsequently became one of the main centres of the strike.&lt;ref name="Milne"&gt;{{cite book|year=2004|quote=Sheffield, at the centre of the country's largest coalfield and renowned at the time as the capital of the 'socialist republic of South Yorkshire', offered by far the best deal and it was there that the NUM set up shop in the spring of 1983.|title=[[The Enemy Within (1994 book)]]|page=170|author=Seumas Milne|isbn=1844675084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it lost some of its relevance following the Labour Party's shift towards [[New Labour]] and the expulsion of the [[far-left]] elements of the party, along with the replacement of [[Thatcherism]] with the more moderate [[Majorism]] and [[Blairism]], the name remains in use for the area, which is still dominated by the political left. Up until and including the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], the only seat in South Yorkshire not held by Labour was Sheffield Hallam; which was held at the time of the election by the-then Leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister]], [[Nick Clegg]]. However, despite not winning, the seat did experience an increase in the Labour vote and the Labour Party candidate Oliver Coppard significantly reduced then-Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg's majority from 15,284 votes to just 2,353 votes.&lt;ref name="Hallam"&gt;{{cite book|year=2002|quote=The 'Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire' has not always been as solidly Labour as it is now, with just one Liberal Democrat seat in the shape of Sheffield Hallam breaking the monopoly.|page=302|isbn=0415268338|title=Almanac of British Politics|author=Bryon Criddle|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/main-topics/politics/south-yorkshire-results-labour-hold-barnsley-and-rotherham-heartlands-1-7250383|author=James Reed|title=South Yorkshire results: Labour hold Barnsley and Rotherham heartlands|date=8 May 2015|newspaper=Yorkshire Post|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
Labour, supported by the left-wing group [[Momentum (organisation)|Momentum]], gained Sheffield Hallam at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 snap general election]] for the first time in their history, while also retaining all of their existing South Yorkshire seats, meaning that Labour controlled every seat in South Yorkshire for the first time. The Labour candidate [[Jared O'Mara]] won a majority of 2,125 votes over Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg, and Clegg's loss was one of the major high-profile losses on the night of 8 June 2017. O'Mara was suspended from the Labour Party on 25 October 2017 after it emerged that he had made derogatory comments online about women and homosexuals, years prior to his election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/18/jared-omara-labour-mp-sheffield-hallam-defeated-nick-clegg|title=Jared O'Mara, the pub-owning first-time MP who won Nick Clegg’s seat |date=18 June 2017|accessdate=27 October 2017|newspaper=The Observer|first=Rachel|last=Cooke}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=OMara|[[Jared O'Mara]], who won Sheffield Hallam as the Labour candidate in 2017, has since been suspended from the party.}}

As of 2017, all four [[metropolitan borough]] councils – [[Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council|Barnsley]], [[Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council|Doncaster]], [[Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council|Rotherham]] and [[Sheffield City Council|Sheffield]] – are under Labour control, and the Conservatives do not hold a single seat in Rotherham or Sheffield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/main-topics/politics/yorkshire-s-council-election-results-in-full-success-for-labour-and-tories-1-7251476|author1=Lindsay Pantry  |author2=John Roberts |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Yorkshire’s council election results in full: Success for Labour and Tories|date=8 May 2015|newspaper=Yorkshire Post|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council is currently suspended following the [[Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal]] and the executive is in the hands of Government-appointed commissioners.

In [[international relations]], a '''rapprochement''', which comes from the [[French language|French]] word ''rapprocher'' ("to bring together"), is a re-establishment of cordial relations, as between two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/rapprochement|title=rapprochement - definition of rapprochement in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the political scene of an individual country, rapprochement means the bringing together of diverse political factions as, for example, during [[Metapolitefsi#Metapolitefsi through Democracy: The transition that worked|metapolitefsi]] in [[Greece]]. 
Other examples of its use are the mending of [[Sino-American relations|relations]] between the [[United States]] under [[Richard Nixon]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] from 1972 onwards.  Additionally, the period known as [[détente]], or "relaxation", between the United States and the Soviet Union during the 1970s was a time of rapprochement.

'''Rapprochement''' also refers to a human developmental milestone usually occurring between 15 and 24 months.  The child moves away from and then returns to the mother for reassurance&lt;ref&gt;Rapprochement subphase of the separation individuation process., Margaret Mahler, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''RespectAbility''' is an [[United States|American]] [[nonpartisanism|nonpartisan]] [[nonprofit]] organization dedicated to empowerment and self-advocacy for individuals with [[Disability|disabilities]]. Its official mission is to fight stigmas and advance opportunities for people with disabilities. Started by one-time [[political consulting|political consultant]] [[Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi]] and philanthropists [[Donn Weinberg]] (its founding chairperson, from ''The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation'') and [[Shelly Cohen]] in 2013. Its chairperson is Calvin Harris,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.respectability.org/2017/07/11/calvin-harris/&lt;/ref&gt; who has a background in [[social justice]], [[public policy]] and [[philanthropy]]. ''RespectAbility'' is currently headquartered in [[Rockville, Maryland]].

The organization was recognized for its innovation by Slingshot.&lt;ref&gt;http://ejewishphilanthropy.com/introducing-the-slingshot-class-of-2014-2015/&lt;/ref&gt; It is also recognized by Guide Star at the Platinum level for its inclusion, transparency and excellence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.guidestar.org/profile/46-2840232)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, a flag was flown over the United States Capitol in honor of RespectAbility's work on behalf of Americans with disabilities.

On June 3, 2018 the Maryland General Assembly gave an Official Citation to RespectAbility for its dedication and commitment to the inclusion of people with disabilities.

Sulam presented RespectAbility with the Advocacy Leadership Award in June 2018.

== Education and employment for persons with disabilities ==
RespectAbility is working to expand education and employment opportunities for people with disabilities and its president, Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi, has published hundreds of articles on disability issues. On [[C-SPAN]] she outlined many of their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4680316/respectability-president-jennifer-laszlo-mizrahis-opening-remarks|title=RespectAbility President Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi’s Opening Remarks|website=C-SPAN.org|language=English|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; RespectAbility has worked with 46 governors to help advance and realign state programs to help people with disabilities obtain competitive, integrated employment opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://curemedical.com/respectability-takes-a-stand-for-disabilities/|title=RespectAbility Advances Job Opportunities for People with Disabilities - Cure Medical|date=2017-08-02|work=Cure Medical|access-date=2017-12-07|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://curemedical.com/respectability-takes-a-stand-for-disabilities/|title=RespectAbility Advances Job Opportunities for People with Disabilities - Cure Medical|date=2017-08-02|work=Cure Medical|access-date=2017-12-07|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; RespectAbility has provided testimony on disability employment in all 50 states and at the federal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.dol.gov/odep/topics/date/RespectAbility_DOL_Advisory_Committee_Testimony_04-15-16_FINAL.pdf |title=RespectAbility – Public Testimony Submission: The Department of Labor Advisory Committee on Increasing Competitive, Integrated Employment for Individuals with Disabilities |last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disabled Persons in media and movies ==
RespectAbility is working to change the narrative in Hollywood to ensure accurate and positive media portrayals of people with disabilities. RespectAbility is working with several partners within the entertainment industry on the full inclusion of people with disabilities, both in front and behind the camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.respectability.org/identifying-models-success/|title=Identifying Models of Success - Respect Ability|work=Respect Ability|access-date=2017-12-07|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their publication, Disability &amp; Criminal Justice Reform: Keys to Success&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.respectability.org/2016/06/20/disability-and-criminal-justice-reform-keys-to-success|title=Disability and Criminal Justice Reform: Keys to Success|date=2016-06-20|work=Respect Ability|access-date=2017-12-08|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was featured on [[PBS]] [[PBS NewsHour|NewsHour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/prisoners-with-disabilities-lack-scaffolding-for-success/|title=Prisoners with disabilities lack ‘scaffolding for success’|website=PBS NewsHour|language=English|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Political outreach and advocacy ==
RespectAbility is the parent organization for www.TheRespectAbilityReport.org, which covers the intersection of politics and public policy. It covered all the presidential candidates in the 2016 presidential campaign. Their political advocacy was featured in a segment on the PBS NewsHour,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/candidates-offer-americans-disabilities-growing-voting-bloc|title=What the candidates offer to Americans with disabilities, a growing voting bloc|website=PBS NewsHour|language=English|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Diane Rehm Show]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dianerehm.org/shows/2015-07-13/the-americans-with-disabilities-act-25-years-later|title=The Americans With Disabilities Act 25 Years Later - Diane Rehm|work=Diane Rehm|access-date=2017-12-08|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; page 1 of ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/us/politics/hillary-clinton-speech.html|title=Hillary Clinton Outlines Vision of More Job Opportunities for People With Disabilities|last=Flegenheimer|first=Matt|date=2016-09-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-08|last2=Chozick|first2=Amy|language=English|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and page 1 of ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clinton-makes-an-unusual-push-to-win-over-disabled-people-and-their-families/2016/09/21/41f15962-8012-11e6-8d0c-fb6c00c90481_story.html|title=Clinton makes an unusual push: To win over disabled people and their families|last=Wagner|first=John|date=2016-09-21|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-12-08|last2=Phillip|first2=Abby|language=English|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NPR]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/09/22/495000558/clinton-puts-focus-on-56-million-invisible-disabled-voters|title=Clinton Puts Focus On 56 Million 'Invisible' Voters With Disabilities|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; HME News,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hmenews.com/article/qa-respectability-s-jennifer-laszlo-mizrahi|title=Q&amp;A: RespectAbility’s Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi {{!}} HME News|website=www.hmenews.com|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Atlantic]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/disability-2016-election/426798/|title=A Reporting Project Puts Disabilities on the Political Agenda|last=Perry|first=David M.|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-12-08|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other publications.

==Controversy==

The organization has come under fire due to its CEO [[Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi]]'s comments about race and the 2016 election. Although Mizrahi was making a highly technical (and probably incorrect) point about what might turn the election in favor of Hillary Clinton, multiple [[disability rights]] bloggers objected to Mizrahi's comments.&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;Intersectional Justice: Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi's Post on White Voters and Disability [http://www.thismess.net/2016/09/intersectional-justice-jennifer-lazlo.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RespectAbility, Class and Race Privilege, and Leveling the Erring Field [https://talesfromthecripblog.com/2016/09/28/respectability-class-and-race-privilege-and-leveling-the-erring-field/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://disabilitythinking.com/disabilitythinking/2016/9/26/whats-the-problem What's the Problem?]&lt;/ref&gt; After Mizrahi's September 21, 2016 comments on her ''personal'' [[Facebook]] page, the organization stated Mizrahi did not speak for the organization on matters of that type in her personal blog.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; However, the following day, Mizrahi spoke on behalf of RespectAbility USA when she was quoted on [[CNN]] about white disabled voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/hillary-clinton-economy-disabled/ Clinton ignores Trump, delivers speech on helping disabled]&lt;/ref&gt; In response, RespectAbility issued an apology, which many disabled bloggers felt was a non-apology since she never actually apologized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.respectability.org/2016/09/23/public-apology/|title=Public Apology - Respect Ability|date=2016-09-23|work=Respect Ability|access-date=2017-12-08|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the organization issued a more detailed apology amidst pressure from the disability community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-open-letter-to-the-disability-organization-respectability_us_57e88457e4b05d3737be6276|title=An Open Letter To The Disability Organization RespectAbility On Racism And Apologies|last=Blahovec|first=Sarah|date=2016-09-26|website=Huffington Post|language=English|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harriet Tubman Collective, have called out RespectAbility and Mizrahi on their social media platforms, for her racism, and appropriation of the work of their members, who are disabled black women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/HTCollective/posts/1658826824414755?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBroicJ4CA1ijh88TPBmMreta7TJRzY0qQIrBrJXPgPwkUEoheH9nWNhPlAFGeKqhq5ygzxUs8Jb47QFbSWdwovh1SCcQkFZx0a4IdOTcwloWGSSCNumAnWqRvvgJk1IEY0pNGWw4FCbpOzEDWfKa_pHHVLOO8-CDiGw8X6EGOLCwo02fGKlXU&amp;__tn__=H-R|title=Harriet Tubman Collective|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
On August 16, 2017, the organization orchestrated an event called “Diversity, Equity and Equality in Hollywood” alongside [[Hollywood]] [[Film producer|producer]] [[Jonathan Murray]], known for his [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] winning show ''[[Born This Way (TV series)|Born This Way]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.respectability.org/2017/08/07/diversity-equity-and-equality-in-hollywood-breakfast/|title=Diversity, Equity and Equality in Hollywood Breakfast|date=2017-08-07|work=Respect Ability|access-date=2017-12-08|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with this, a [[focus group]] was held where people joined and talked about existing [[Badge of shame|stigma]] and [[perception]]s of persons with disabilities among Hollywood decision makers. The focus group was featured in [[Ability (magazine)|Ability Magazine.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://abilitymagazine.com/focus-group-a-candid-look-at-disability-inclusion|title=ABILITY Magazine - Focus Group — A Candid Look at Disability Inclusion|date=2017-10-09|work=ABILITY Magazine|access-date=2017-12-08|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 2017, RespectAbility held a summit at [[Rayburn House Office Building|Rayburn House]] on [[Capitol Hill]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disability-advocates-stage-capitol-hill-summit-hollywood-inclusion-1026701|title=Disability Advocates Stage Capitol Hill Summit on Hollywood Inclusion|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Washington, D.C.]], with speakers focussing on advocating for persons with disabilities in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnialive.com/articles/empire-casting-director-leah-daniels-butler-confirmed-to-speak-at-respectability-summit|title=“Empire” Casting Director Leah Daniels-Butler Confirmed to Speak at RespectAbility Summit|last=Alive|first=MNI|website=www.mnialive.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whartondc.com/article.html?aid=3609|title=Wharton Club Of DC|website=www.whartondc.com|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Revolutionary Communist Party of India''' ({{lang-as|ভাৰতৰ বিপ্লৱী কমিউনিষ্ট পাৰ্টি}} {{lang-bn|ভারতের বিপ্লবী কমিউনিষ্ট পার্টি}}  {{lang-ml|റെവല്യൂഷനറി കമ്മ്യൂണിസ്റ്റ് പാർട്ടി ഓഫ് ഇന്ത്യ}}) (abbreviated '''RCPI''', {{lang-as|আৰ.চি.পি.আই.}} {{lang-bn|আর.সি.পি.আই.}} {{lang-ml|ആർ.സി.പി.ഐ.}}) is a small political party in India. The party was founded as the '''Communist League''' by [[Saumyendranath Tagore]] in 1934, breaking away from the [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI). RCPI led armed uprisings after the [[independence of India]], but later shifted to parliamentary politics. The party is active in the [[West Bengal]] and [[Assam]]. The party was represented in the West Bengal [[Second United Front Cabinet]] (1969) as well as in various state government during the [[Left Front (West Bengal)|Left Front]] rule in the state (1977–2011). In Assam the party won four Legislative Assembly seats in 1978, but its political influence has since declined.

==Ideology==
The RCPI works toward a socialist revolution, rather than a [[People's democracy (Marxism–Leninism)|people's democratic revolution]], a national democratic revolution or a [[New Democracy|new democratic revolution]].

The party strives to build socialism under the leadership of the proletariat with active cooperation of other exploited strata of the humanity, including peasants, working intellectuals and non-manual working sections of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcpicommunist.in/p/blog-page_26.html?m=1|title=Constitution of RCPI|website=www.rcpicommunist.in|access-date=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communist League==
S.N. Tagore founded the '''Communist League''' on 1 August 1934.&lt;ref name=pts&gt;Partido de los Trabajadores Socialistas.

As the Indian National Congress dominated the tea gardens of Assam and there was little industrial labour in the province, the Communist League instead sought to organize rice mill workers, horse cart drivers and steamboat labourers.&lt;ref name="Saikia2015136"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arupjyoti Saikia|title=A Century of Protests: Peasant Politics in Assam Since 1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-sNcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136|date=12 August 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-32560-4|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts had meagre results.&lt;ref name="Saikia2015136"/&gt; Notably RCPI made no intents to build the party in the hill areas of [[Assam]].&lt;ref name=c/&gt;

==RCPI and the World War==
The party was organized along [[Leninist]] lines with party cells at the bottom of the party hierarchy and the [[Central Committee]] as its leadership.&lt;ref name="Weiner2015" /&gt; In preparation of the impending World War, the party developed a three-tier leadership structure in order for the party to survive under waves of repression.&lt;ref name=tr /&gt; The third tier was entirely clandestine, prepared to take over the party affairs after arrests of the first two tiers.&lt;ref name=tr /&gt;

The party raised the slogan "Not one [[paisa]], not one man for war". On 4 September 1939 Tagore issued a declaration, labelling the war as an imperialist conflict and called on the Indian workers to turn the imperialist war into civil war.&lt;ref name=pts /&gt; Tagore was arrested and jailed under the [[Defence of India Act, 1939|Defence of India Act]] immediately afterwards.&lt;ref name=pts /&gt;&lt;ref name=tr /&gt; With Tagore in jail, Pannalal Dasgupta became general secretary of the party.&lt;ref name=tr /&gt; He toured Assam, [[Bombay]], [[Madras]] and Bengal.{{cn|date=December 2017}} During the Second World War, peasants influenced by the party were instructed not to sell rice for exportation.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

In 1941 the Third Party Conference of the Communist League of India changed its name to '''Communist Party of India''' (not to be confused with its far more well-known namesake).&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|title=Society and Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c71PAQAAIAAJ|date=April 1995|publisher=Mihir Purkayastha for the ASSSC|pages=1, 4, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1943 the name RCPI was adopted, in order to differentiate itself from the CPI.&lt;ref name=a /&gt; The party positioned itself claiming to be the sole true leftist party in the country, denouncing all other left forces as ideologically bankrupt.&lt;ref name="Chowdhuri2007" /&gt; Overall RCPI avoided collaboration with other left-wing groups.&lt;ref name="Basu1994" /&gt; RCPI labour organizing was done largely outside the [[All India Trade Union Congress]].&lt;ref name="Basu1994" /&gt; It managed to build a core of political cadres and was active building a labour movement amongst workers at the jute mills in the Beliaghata-Narkeldanga area of Calcutta.&lt;ref name="Basu1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nirban Basu|title=The working class movement: a study of jute mills of Bengal, 1937–47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lU7tAAAAMAAJ|year=1994|publisher=K.P.

RCPI differed with CPI on tactical questions during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="Sadasivan1977" /&gt; RCPI denounced the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] as well as declaring the Soviet war with [[Finland]] as 'imperialist'.&lt;ref name="Sadasivan1977" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiner2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Myron Weiner|title=Party Politics in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xz_WCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122|date=8 December 2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-7841-3|pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCPI fully supported the [[Quit India movement]].&lt;ref name="Sadasivan1977" /&gt; The party sought to develop the Quit India movement into a revolutionary upheaval.&lt;ref name=tr /&gt; Most of the known party leaders were arrested, and would remain in detention until the end of the Second World War.&lt;ref name=tr /&gt; Through the Radical Institute, RCPI promoted dissemination of locally produced weaponry to use against British government forces in Assam.&lt;ref name="Saikia2015145" /&gt;

In the "Red Front", in October 1942, [[Saumyendranath Tagore]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The conclusions that we draw from the Quit India movement are the following:

&lt;p&gt;First, the utter bankruptcy of the Congress, the party of the Indian bourgeoisie and its total inability to lead the national movement.

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the complete overthrow of non-violence as a technique of struggle.

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the complete exposure of the National Frontists, the legal Communists, the germ-carriers of anti-revolutionary Stalinism.

&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, the rapid revolutionisation of the masses.

&lt;p&gt;Fifthly, the ripening of the ideological premises for the growth of real leftism as a result of the political development, both national and international.

&lt;p&gt;The national revolution in India has definitely jumped over the hurdles of Gandhism and has scronfully rejected the petty bourgeois Congress Socialism which is at the service of the Indian bourgeoisie.

&lt;p&gt;It has thoroughly exposed the legal communist traitors of the Stalinist and the Royist brand. Only the political line of the Revolutionary Communist Party stands fully vindicated by the development and march of the national revolutionary movement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1945 RCPI raised two key slogans in Assam, 'land to the tiller' (''nangal jar mati tar'') and 'one third share' (''tin bhag''), slogans which became very popular amongst landless peasants and agricultural labourers.&lt;ref name="Saikia20153"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arupjyoti Saikia|title=A Century of Protests: Peasant Politics in Assam Since 1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-sNcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|date=12 August 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-32560-4|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; KBP was able to make some inroads amongst these sectors.&lt;ref name="Saikia2015150"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arupjyoti Saikia|title=A Century of Protests: Peasant Politics in Assam Since 1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-sNcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150|date=12 August 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-32560-4|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Tribal League leaders in Assam, such as Aniram Basumatari and Daben Khaklari, became RCPI members in the mid-1940s.&lt;ref name="Saikia2015168"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arupjyoti Saikia|title=A Century of Protests: Peasant Politics in Assam Since 1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-sNcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA168|date=12 August 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-32560-4|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their presence in the party helped it to make inroads amongst the tribals in Assam.&lt;ref name="Saikia2015168" /&gt;

==Independence and Partition==
As the departure of British colonial rule came closer, RCPI denounced the negotiated independence as a joint conspiracy between British imperialism and the Indian bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name="Chowdhuri2007"/&gt; RCPI stated that Independence obtained in 1947 was a false one.&lt;ref name="Saikia2015159"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arupjyoti Saikia|title=A Century of Protests: Peasant Politics in Assam Since 1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-sNcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159|date=12 August 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-32560-4|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting the official process for independence, RCPI began organizing ''[[panchayat]]s'' (i.e. [[soviet]]s) of workers and peasants in order to convene a Workers and Peasants Constituent Assembly.&lt;ref name=tr/&gt; RCPI denounced the [[Partition of India]] as betrayal and surrender to British imperialism.&lt;ref name="Chowdhuri2007"/&gt; There was a strong Hindu chauvinist trend within RCPI, as alleged by Charles W. Ervin.&lt;ref name=m/&gt; RCPI opposed the [[1946 Cabinet Mission to India]], which wanted placed Assam into the Muslim-majority grouping of provinces.&lt;ref name="Saikia2015134"/&gt; According to Salkia, through its opposition to the Cabinet Mission grouping RCPI was able to carve out "a niche for itself in the mainstream politics of Assam".&lt;ref name="Saikia2015134"/&gt;

In 1946 RCPI discussed a possible merger with the [[Bolshevik-Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma]].&lt;ref name=tr/&gt; The RCPI delegation in the talks consisted of Sudhir Dasgupta, Tarapada Gupta, and Gour Pal.&lt;ref name=tr/&gt; Nevertheless, the merger discussion didn't go through.&lt;ref name=tr/&gt; RCPI refused to join the [[Fourth International]].&lt;ref name=tr/&gt; The BLPI discarded the RCPI line of organizing ''soviets'' as a premature move.&lt;ref name=tr/&gt;

In September 1947 RCPI and BLPI collaborated to build a United Workers Front to challenge the Congress-led trade unions.&lt;ref name=m&gt;''[https://www.marxists.org/francais/clt/1996-2000/CLT61-Feb-1998.pdf Cahiers Leon Trotsky]'', February 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1947 Tagore was elected president of the All India Bank Employees Association, at its conference held in [[Lucknow]].&lt;ref&gt;Syndicate Bank Employees Union (Regd). ''[http://www.sbeu.in/pdf/Looking%20Back%20PDF.pdf Looking Back]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tagore–Dasgupta split==
Tagore was jailed in November 1947.&lt;ref name="Sadasivan1977" /&gt; Tagore was released from prison in 1948.&lt;ref name="Sadasivan1977" /&gt; After his release from jail Tagore argued that armed revolution was premature in India.&lt;ref name="Sadasivan1977" /&gt; But a sector of the party, led by Pannalal Dasgupta, insisted on turning the campaign of building panchayats into a general armed insurrection.&lt;ref name="Sadasivan1977" /&gt;&lt;ref name=tr /&gt;

Dasgupta assembled an All India Party Conference in [[Birbhum]] in 1948.&lt;ref name="Sadasivan1977" /&gt; Tagore requested to resign from the RCPI Central Committee, a request the Birbhum conference rejected.&lt;ref name="Sadasivan1977" /&gt; After the Birbhum conference the followers of Dasgupta began to gather arms and prepare for armed struggle.&lt;ref name=tr /&gt; The developments inside RCPI had an echo in the CPI.&lt;ref name="Saikia2015209"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arupjyoti Saikia|title=A Century of Protests: Peasant Politics in Assam Since 1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-sNcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA209|date=12 August 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-32560-4|pages=209–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dasgupta's view that India was ripe for armed revolution coincided with the position of the new CPI leader [[B.T. Ranadive]].&lt;ref name="Saikia2015209" /&gt;

After the Birbhum conference Tagore, at a public meeting in [[Calcutta]], denounced insurrectional line of Dasgupta.&lt;ref name="Sadasivan1977" /&gt; Tagore's speech pushed the Dasgupta group to issue disciplinary action against him, accepting his resignation from the Central Committee.&lt;ref name="Sadasivan1977" /&gt; Half a year later Tagore gathered his followers for a separate Party Conference, as its 5th Party Congress, in [[Burdwan]].&lt;ref name="Sadasivan1977" /&gt;&lt;ref name=tr /&gt; Thus there were two parallel RCPIs, one led by Dasgupta and one led by Tagore.&lt;ref name="Sadasivan1977" /&gt; Dasgupta represented the majority group in the split.&lt;ref name=m /&gt; It was sometimes known as 'RCPI (Rebel Group)'&lt;ref name="Dept1965" /&gt; or as 'RCPI (Dasgupta)'. The Tagore-led party was known as '[[Revolutionary Communist Party of India (Tagore)|RCPI (Tagore)]]'.

[[File:Sir Garry Sobers 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Garfield Sobers|Sir Garfield Sobers]] in 2012]]
[[Garfield Sobers]], [[List of West Indies cricket captains|captain]] of the [[West Indies cricket team]] and one of the most prominent [[cricket]]ers in the world, outraged many in the [[Caribbean]] in September 1970 when he took part in a friendly [[forms of cricket#Double-wicket cricket|double-wicket]] tournament at [[Harare Sports Club|Salisbury Sports Club]] in [[Rhodesia]] (renamed Zimbabwe in 1980), a country in southern Africa that was [[list of historical unrecognized states|unrecognised]] internationally because of its mostly white minority government. The resulting furore nearly caused him to lose the captaincy, and threatened the unity of the West Indies team itself.

Sobers was captain of the "Rest of the World" team that [[Rest of the World cricket team in England in 1970|toured England]] between May and August 1970 in place of the [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa national team]], whose proposed tour had been [[Sporting boycott of South Africa during the Apartheid era|cancelled]] by English cricketing authorities because of [[apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]]. He accepted an invitation to the Rhodesian competition from [[Eddie Barlow]], a South African member of the Rest of the World team, and arrived in [[Harare|Salisbury]] on the day of the event. To ecstatic applause from the mostly white spectators, Sobers partnered South African [[Test cricket|Test]] captain [[Ali Bacher]] in the tournament, and said afterwards that he had enjoyed himself, though he and Bacher had not won. Having established a personal rapport with the Rhodesian Prime Minister, [[Ian Smith]], Sobers left the next day and returned home to [[Barbados]].

Many in the West Indies were appalled by Sobers' actions, and when he subsequently made positive comments about Smith, Rhodesia and white South African cricketers in press interviews and announced his intention to play more cricket in Rhodesia, the vitriol intensified, with one [[Antigua]]n newspaper branding him a "white black man".&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt; A number of prominent figures, including entire political parties, called for Sobers to be stripped of the West Indies cricket captaincy. [[Guyana|Guyanese]] Prime Minister [[Forbes Burnham]] barred Sobers from Guyana, and Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] of India announced that if Sobers remained in the team, India would pull out of its upcoming [[Indian cricket team in West Indies in 1970–71|tour of the West Indies]]. Sobers argued that as a "professional cricketer and a sportsman, not a politician",&lt;ref name=age17sep/&gt; he had done nothing wrong.

The [[West Indies Cricket Board]] (WICB) contemplated whether it would be better to cancel all matches in Guyana or to sack Sobers; neither prospect was attractive. The crisis ended when [[Eric Williams]], the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, wrote a letter of apology for Sobers to sign, which was relayed to the WICB and several governmental bodies in late October 1970. This was accepted, and the incident was soon largely forgotten. Sobers regained his overwhelming popularity with West Indian cricket fans, continued as team captain until 1972 and retired from cricket two years later. He thereafter retained his stance that politics should not interfere with sport. His Rhodesian visit has been cited as precursoring the [[South African rebel tours]] controversy of the 1980s.

==Background==
[[Garfield Sobers]], from the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Barbados]], was widely regarded as one of the world's finest [[cricket]]ers from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, and is placed by many among the best to ever play the sport.&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt;&lt;ref name=np&gt;{{Harvnb
|Nauright
|Parrish
|2012
|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[all-rounder]], he made his debut for the [[West Indies cricket team]], the multinational side representing the Caribbean in international cricket, at the age of 17 in 1954. He was a regular member of the team for the next two decades. Sobers set a [[Test cricket records|then-world record highest individual score]] of 365 [[Run (cricket)|runs]] [[not out]] during a [[Test cricket|Test match]] against [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] in 1958,&lt;ref name=ls&gt;{{Harvnb
|Lawrence
|Scarlett
|1987
|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became [[List of West Indies cricket captains|captain]] of the West Indies team six years later. In domestic [[first-class cricket]], he was one of the first West Indians to play abroad, representing [[South Australia cricket team|South Australia]] and [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] during the 1960s and 1970s. His [[batting (cricket)|batting]], [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] and [[fielding (cricket)|fielding]] were all regarded as excellent by contemporaries, but his decision making and tactics were occasionally criticised.&lt;ref name=np/&gt;

[[Rhodesia]] was an [[list of historical unrecognized states|unrecognised state]] in southern Africa, run by a predominantly white minority government headed by Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]]. Taking exception to the UK's insistence on [[no independence before majority rule|majority rule as a condition for independence]], Smith's colonial administration had [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] in 1965 following a long dispute over the terms. International uproar and the first ever United Nations economic sanctions had ensued, making Rhodesia deeply isolated. This quarantine variously extended to sports. Rhodesian athletes, including the 1968, 1972 and 1976 [[Rhodesia at the Olympics|Olympic squads]] (which were racially integrated), were barred from international competition on political grounds. Rhodesian cricket and rugby were not greatly affected as these sports largely operated in tandem with South Africa. The [[Rhodesia cricket team]], for example, took part in the annual [[Sunfoil Series|Currie Cup]] tournament against South African provincial sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Geldenhuys
|1990
|pp=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As world opinion hardened against South Africa during the 1960s because of [[apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]], international governing bodies in various sports introduced [[Sporting boycott of South Africa during the Apartheid era|boycotts]] of South African teams and athletes.&lt;ref name=williamson2012/&gt; Until 1976, non-whites were legally barred from the [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa cricket team]], and, as the law required matches to be racially homogenous, this also applied to visiting squads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Odendaal
|2003
|pp=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South African government provoked overseas ire in 1968 when it refused entry to the [[England cricket team]] because its proposed tour party included [[Basil D'Oliveira]], a [[Cape Coloured]]. Amid the ensuing [[D'Oliveira affair|scandal]], [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (which then governed English cricket) called off the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Williamson
|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, a tour of England by the South Africa cricket team was cancelled by the English [[Test and County Cricket Board]] (TCCB) at a week's notice following public protests and immense pressure from the UK government.&lt;ref name=williamson2012/&gt; South Africa did not play another official international cricket match until 1991.&lt;ref name=williamson2012&gt;{{Harvnb
|Williamson
|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TCCB sought to recoup the lost revenues for the 1970 season by hastily organising a replacement series of matches between England and a "[[Rest of the World cricket team in England in 1970|Rest of the World]]" team comprising leading cricketers from around the world. This squad, described by the leading cricket publication ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' as "one of the strongest teams ever to take the field",&lt;ref name=ryderwhish&gt;{{Harvnb
|Ryder-Whish
|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; included five South Africans, five West Indians (including Sobers, as captain), two Pakistanis and a player each from [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[India national cricket team|India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Manley
|1988
|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; It defeated England 4–1 over a tour lasting from late June to late August 1970.&lt;ref name=ryderwhish/&gt;

==Sobers in Rhodesia==
[[File:Ian Smith 1975.jpg|thumb|upright|Rhodesian Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]] attended the tournament and had dinner with Sobers afterwards.|alt=A photograph of Ian Smith]]
[[Eddie Barlow]], one of the South African members of the Rest of the World team, suggested to Sobers towards the end of the English series that the West Indian might like to take part in a friendly [[forms of cricket#Double-wicket cricket|double-wicket]] competition in the Rhodesian capital [[Harare|Salisbury]] on 12 September, the local [[Public holidays in Rhodesia|Pioneers' Day]] holiday.{{#tag:ref|Double-wicket cricket is a variant of the sport in which pairs of players each are pitted against each other. Each team bats for one [[innings]] (comprising a set number of [[over (cricket)|overs]]), bowls for a certain number of overs, and fields for the rest. Getting [[Dismissal (cricket)|out]] causes a batsman to have a set number of runs deducted from his side's score. The winning team is that with the highest final total of runs after all pairs have batted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Ahmed}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="n"|name="doublewicket"}} Barlow was one of several prominent South African cricketers already booked to play. Sobers was initially noncommittal, but decided to go following assurances that Rhodesia did not practise apartheid and there would be no racial discrimination regarding team selection. Sobers' intended participation became public on 7 September when a London newspaper reported on it; widespread condemnation of the West Indian captain followed, but he still travelled, landing in Salisbury early on the day of the event.&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt;

Sobers was enthusiastically received in Salisbury by blacks and whites alike;&lt;ref name=vidn/&gt; he described the reception and hospitality as "wonderful" and "just great".&lt;ref name=herald17sep/&gt; After a few hours' rest, he made his way to [[Harare Sports Club|Salisbury Sports Club]] for the competition, in which he partnered the South African Test captain [[Ali Bacher]], whom he had never met. Sobers received [[Pound sterling|£]]600 for appearing. The largely white capacity crowd gave the Barbadian a hero's welcome, accompanying his walk out to the [[wicket]] with a standing ovation and a chorus of "[[For He's a Jolly Good Fellow]]". Having flown in just that morning, Sobers underperformed, and he and Bacher did not win.&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt; All the same, the other teams formed a [[guard of honour]] for them as they left the field. Bacher found Sobers be "a great guy with no airs or graces";&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Hartman
|2006
|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; he suggested to his teammate that he should consider also playing in South Africa.&lt;ref name=vidn&gt;{{Harvnb
|The Virgin Islands Daily News
|17 September 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobers spent part of the day sitting with Ian Smith in the stands. Both reported enjoying the occasion; Smith, a keen sports fan and a talented player in his day, fondly recounted his "lovely day discussing the great men of cricket" with Sobers in his memoirs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Smith
|1997
|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Sobers recalled the Rhodesian premier as "a tremendous person to talk to".&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt; After the tournament ended, they continued their conversation over dinner.&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt; Smith told Sobers that he was welcome to come back to Rhodesia whenever he liked.&lt;ref name=herald17sep/&gt; Sobers left the next day, after less than 48 hours in the country,&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt; and returned home to Barbados on 15 September 1970.&lt;ref name=herald17sep/&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:Michael Manley.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jamaican politician [[Michael Manley]] was among those who criticised Sobers on his return to the West Indies.|alt=A photograph of Michael Manley]]
Sobers was met in [[Bridgetown]] by an enormous and hostile press storm. "To say there was an uproar in the Caribbean is comprehensively to understate what took place," the Jamaican politician [[Michael Manley]] later wrote in his ''History of West Indies Cricket''.&lt;ref name=manley195&gt;{{Harvnb
|Manley
|1988
|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Antigua Labour Party]]'s ''Workers' Voice'' newspaper damned Sobers as "a white black man"&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt; and charged that by playing in Rhodesia, he had "abdicated his loyalty to Africans everywhere, and all West Indians in particular".&lt;ref name=age17sep&gt;{{Harvnb
|The Age
|17 September 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manley's opinion was that if Sobers did not apologise, he "may not be welcomed anywhere by people who believe that justice is bigger than even sport".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Beckles
|Stoddart
|1995
|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Leslie Walcott|Frank Walcott]] of the [[Barbados Workers' Union]], who was a personal friend of Sobers, publicly called for his captaincy of the West Indies to be revoked, as did many others.&lt;ref name=vidn/&gt; Sobers told reporters at [[Grantley Adams International Airport|Seawell Airport]] that he had "never been bothered about criticism, and I do not see why I should start now".&lt;ref name=herald17sep/&gt; Sympathy for Sobers amid the affair came mainly from his fellow Barbadians. Vernon Jamadar, [[Leader of the Opposition (Trinidad and Tobago)|Leader of the Opposition]] in Trinidad and Tobago, praised Sobers' "calm dignity in response to the primitive savagery of West Indian gutter politicians".&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt;

Sobers told the media that he had played in Rhodesia as he felt it would be good for cricket, particularly after the cancellation of the South African tour of England, and that politics had not entered his mind. He told interviewers that he had had no problems whatsoever in Rhodesia, that sport in Rhodesia appeared to him to be integrated and that he intended to accept Smith's invitation to return there in the future to play more cricket. Reporting Bacher's suggestion of playing in South Africa, Sobers said that he probably would not do so: "I don't know if I would want to get involved in that," he said, "but it does show that South African cricketers are willing to play with and against players of any colour, race or creed."&lt;ref name=vidn/&gt; Sobers said that the white South African members of the Rest of the World squad in England had functioned well as part of the multiracial team,&lt;ref name=vidn/&gt; and that he hoped for a similar Rest of the World series in the Caribbean as he believed West Indian cricket fans would enjoy seeing the South African players.&lt;ref name=age17sep/&gt; He expressed confusion regarding the calls for him to be stripped of his captaincy. "I am a professional cricketer and a sportsman, not a politician," he said.&lt;ref name=age17sep/&gt;&lt;ref name=herald17sep&gt;{{Harvnb
|The Glasgow Herald
|17 September 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I went to play cricket. I don't see why this should affect my position as captain of the West Indies team."&lt;ref name=vidn/&gt;

The crisis deepened on 10 October 1970, when [[Guyana|Guyanese]] Prime Minister [[Forbes Burnham]] announced that Sobers would not be allowed to enter Guyana until he apologised. This was a major issue for the [[West Indies Cricket Board]] (WICB) as the team played at least one Test match a year in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], the Guyanese capital. The [[Jamaica Labour Party]] called for Sobers to resign as captain four days later; [[Indira Gandhi]], the Indian Prime Minister, then announced that if Sobers were not removed from the West Indies team, India would cancel its upcoming [[Indian cricket team in West Indies in 1970–71|tour]] of the West Indies, scheduled for early 1971. The WICB considered its options. Cancelling matches in Guyana might prompt Burnham to instruct Guyanese members of the West Indian team to boycott, and sacking Sobers might cause Barbados to withdraw in protest; either way, the unity of the West Indies team was threatened. Meanwhile, no sign of an apology emanated from Sobers.&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt;

==Apology, resolution and legacy==

Taking matters into his own hands, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago [[Eric Williams]] wrote an apology letter for Sobers to sign, addressed to WICB president Noel Pierce, and had it delivered to the West Indies captain by the Barbadian fast bowler [[Wes Hall]].&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt; The letter explained that Sobers had not known of the "deep feelings of the West Indian people" on Rhodesia, that he now better understood the political issues, and that he would not go to the southern African country again. "I therefore wish to convey to you and the members of the board my sincere regrets for any embarrassment which my action may have caused, and to assure you of my unqualified dedication whenever I may be called upon to represent my country—the West Indies—and my people," it concluded.&lt;ref name=age27oct&gt;{{Harvnb
|The Age
|27 October 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=herald27oct&gt;{{Harvnb
|The Glasgow Herald
|27 October 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sobers signed, and the apology was promptly conveyed to the WICB in late October 1970, with copies also going to the council of the [[West Indies Associated States]] and the prime ministerial offices of Barbados, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica.&lt;ref name=age27oct/&gt; "A grateful Caribbean grabbed the apology with both hands," Manley records—"The thought that [Sobers] might be lost as a consequence of a political gaffe was intolerable. For the great majority, the incident was forgiven and promptly forgotten."&lt;ref name=manley195/&gt;

Sobers regained his former popularity and kept the West Indies cricket captaincy until 1972; he retired from the sport two years later. He was subsequently [[List of cricketers who were knighted|knighted]] by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in 1975 for his services to cricket,&lt;ref name=ls/&gt; and named one of the ten [[Barbadian National Heroes|National Heroes of Barbados]] by the Barbadian government in 1998.&lt;ref name=np/&gt; His controversial visit to Rhodesia has been described by cricket journalist Siddhartha Vaidyanathan as precursoring the West Indian "[[South African rebel tours|rebel tours]]" affair of the early 1980s, in which black cricketers from the Caribbean broke the apartheid sporting boycott and played in South Africa. The West Indian rebel players became wildly popular among South African cricket fans, but were punished at home with bans from all organised cricket (initially for life, but lifted in 1989), compounded by lasting social and professional ostracism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Vaidyanathan
|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sobers retained his stance that politics should not interfere with sport, and was reluctant to criticise the West Indians who toured South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Flanagan
|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the same, he came to regret having gone to Rhodesia because of the scandal he had provoked. "Had I known the furore my visit was to cause," he later said, "I would not have gone."&lt;ref name=williamson&gt;{{Harvnb

The '''Southeast Asia Treaty Organization''' ('''SEATO''') was an [[international organization]] for [[collective security|collective defense]] in [[Southeast Asia]] created by the '''Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty''', or '''Manila Pact''', signed in September 1954 in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]. The formal institution of SEATO was established on 19 February 1955 at a meeting of treaty partners in [[Bangkok]], Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leifer|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's headquarters were also in Bangkok. Eight members joined the organization.

Primarily created to block further [[communism|communist]] gains in Southeast Asia, SEATO is generally considered a failure because internal conflict and dispute hindered general use of the SEATO military; however, SEATO-funded cultural and educational programs left long-standing effects in Southeast Asia. SEATO was dissolved on 30 June 1977 after many members lost interest and withdrew.

==Origins and structure==
[[File:CongressBuilding SEATO.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=A picture of a few SEATO nation leaders in Manila in 1966|The leaders of some of the SEATO nations in front of the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Congress Building]] in [[Manila]], hosted by Philippine President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] on 24 October 1966]]
The Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, or Manila Pact, was signed on 8 September 1954 in [[Manila]],&lt;ref name=Franklin1&gt;{{harvnb|Franklin|2006|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the American [[Truman Doctrine]] of creating anti-communist bilateral and collective defense treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jillson|2009|p=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; These treaties and agreements were intended to create alliances that would contain communist powers ([[China|Communist China]], in SEATO's case).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ooi|2004|pp=338–339}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was considered to have been largely developed by American diplomat and Soviet expert [[George F. Kennan]]. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] (1953–1959) is considered to be the primary force behind the creation of SEATO, which expanded the concept of anti-communist collective defense to Southeast Asia,&lt;ref name=Franklin1/&gt; and then-Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] advocated an Asian equivalent of NATO upon returning from his late-1953 Asia trip.&lt;ref&gt;"Nixon Alone," by Ralph de Toledano, pp. 173–74&lt;/ref&gt; The organization, headquartered in Bangkok, was created in 1955 at the first meeting of the Council of Ministers set up by the treaty, contrary to Dulles's preference to call the organization "ManPac".{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

SEATO was intended to be a Southeast Asian version of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer et al.|2007|p=836}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the military forces of each member would be coordinated to provide for the collective defense of the members' country.  Organizationally, SEATO was headed by the Secretary General, whose office was created in 1957 at a meeting in [[Canberra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Franklin|2006|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Page548&gt;{{harvnb|Page|2003|p=548}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a council of representatives from member nations and an international staff. Also present were committees for economics, security, and information.&lt;ref name=Page548/&gt; SEATO's first Secretary General was [[Pote Sarasin]], a Thai diplomat and politician who had served as Thailand's ambassador to the U.S. between 1952 and 1957,&lt;ref name=Franklin186&gt;{{harvnb|Franklin|2006|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiner|2008|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as Prime Minister of Thailand from September 1957 to 1 January 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/pm_his.htm |title=History of Thai Prime Ministers |publisher=Royal Thai Government |accessdate=22 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426162320/http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/pm_his.htm |archivedate=26 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the NATO alliance, SEATO had no joint commands with standing forces.&lt;ref name=EB60&gt;{{harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica (India)|2000|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, SEATO's response protocol in the event of communism presenting a "common danger" to the member nations was vague and ineffective, though membership in the SEATO alliance did provide a rationale for a large-scale U.S. military intervention in the region during the [[Vietnam War]] (1955–1975).&lt;ref name=Maga&gt;{{harvnb|Maga|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
[[File:SEATO Conference in Manila.gif|thumb|alt=Picture of the 1966 SEATO conference in Manila|1966 SEATO conference in Manila]]
Despite its name, SEATO mostly included countries located outside of the region but with an interest either in the region or the organization itself. They were [[Australia]], [[France]], [[New Zealand]], [[Pakistan]] (including [[East Pakistan]], now [[Bangladesh]]), the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[South Vietnam]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=EB60/&gt;

The Philippines, Thailand and South Vietnam were the only [[Southeast Asia]]n countries that actually participated in the organization. They shared close ties with the United States, particularly the [[Philippines]], and they faced incipient communist insurgencies against their own governments.&lt;ref name="history.state.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), 1954|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1953-1960/SEATO|publisher=Office of the Historian. U.S. Department of State|accessdate=3 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007113024/http://history.state.gov/milestones/1953-1960/SEATO|archivedate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thailand]] became a member upon the discovery of the newly founded "Thai Autonomous Region" (the [[Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture]]) in [[Yunnan]] (in South West China) – apparently feeling threatened by potential Chinese communist subversion on its land.&lt;ref&gt;US PSB, 1953 United States Psychological Studies Board (US PSB). (1953). US Psychological Strategy Based on Thailand, 14 September. Declassified Documents Reference System, 1994, 000556–000557, WH 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Other regional countries like [[Post-independence Burma, 1948–62|Burma]] and [[Indonesia]] were far more mindful of domestic internal stability rather than any communist threat,&lt;ref name="history.state.gov"/&gt; and thus rejected joining it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18430820 Nehru Has Alternative To SEATO]. (5 August 1954). The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842–1954), p. 1. Retrieved 3 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] (including [[Singapore]]) also chose to not participate formally, though it was kept updated with key developments due to its close relationship with the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="history.state.gov"/&gt; The rest of [[Southeast Asia]]n countries: [[North Vietnam]], [[Khmer Rouge]] and [[Pathet Lao]] were prevented from taking part in any international military alliance as a result of the [[Geneva Agreements]] signed 20 July of the same year concluding the end of the [[First Indochina War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:The Final Declaration of The Geneva Conference: On Restoring Peace in Indochina, 21 July 1954]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the lingering threat coming from communist [[North Vietnam]] and the possibility of the [[domino effect|domino theory]] with [[Indochina]] turning into a communist frontier, SEATO got these countries under its protection – an act that would be considered to be one of the main justifications for the U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=Blaxland138&gt;{{harvnb|Blaxland|2006|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kingdom of Cambodia (1953–70)|Cambodia]], however rejected the protection in 1956.&lt;ref name=Grenville366&gt;{{harvnb|Grenville|2001|p=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of SEATO members were not located in [[Southeast Asia]]. To Australia and New Zealand, SEATO was seen as a more satisfying organization than [[ANZUS]] – a collective defense organization with the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=W. Brands, Jr.|first=Henry|title=From ANZUS to SEATO: United States Strategic Policy towards Australia and New Zealand, 1952–1954|journal=The International History Review|date=May 1987|volume= 9|series=No. 2|pages=250–270|doi=10.1080/07075332.1987.9640442}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom and France joined partly due to having long maintained colonies in the region, and partly due to concerns over developments in [[Indochina]]. Pakistan, however, was simply interested in joining over the appeal of potential support for its long struggle against India.&lt;ref name="history.state.gov"/&gt; Last but not least, the U.S. upon perceiving Southeast Asia to be a pivotal frontier for [[Cold War]] geopolitics saw the establishment of SEATO as essential to its [[Cold War]] [[Containment|containment policy]].&lt;ref name="history.state.gov"/&gt;

All in all, the membership reflected a mid-1950s combination of anti-communist Western nations and such nations in Southeast Asia. The United Kingdom, France and the United States, the latter of which joined after the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] ratified the treaty by an 82–1 vote,&lt;ref name=Hearden46&gt;{{harvnb|Hearden|1990|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; represented the strongest Western powers.&lt;ref name=Tarling604&gt;{{harvnb|Tarling|1992|p=604}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canada]] also considered joining, but decided against it in order to concentrate on its [[NATO]] responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Blaxland138"/&gt;

==Military aspects==
[[File:Sabre Mk32s RAAF in Thailand early 1960s.jpg|thumb|250px|Australian No. 79 Squadron Sabres at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand, deployed as part of Australia's commitment to SEATO|alt=A monoplane aircraft with three men and a fuel tanker truck. One of the men is wearing military uniform and the other two are clad only in shorts. The aircraft is mainly painted grey, but is marked with the Royal Australian Air Force roundel and stripes on its tail. The tail of another aircraft of similar appearance is visible in the background.]]

After its creation, SEATO quickly became insignificant militarily, as most of its member nations contributed very little to the alliance.&lt;ref name=Blaxland138/&gt; While SEATO military forces held joint military training, they were never employed because of internal disagreements. SEATO was unable to intervene in [[Laotian Civil War|conflicts in Laos]] because France and the United Kingdom rejected use of military action.&lt;ref name=Grenville366/&gt; As a result, the U.S. provided unilateral support for Laos after 1962.&lt;ref name=Grenville366/&gt; Though sought by the U.S., involvement of SEATO in the [[Vietnam War]] was denied because of lack of British and French cooperation.&lt;ref name=Hearden46/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grenville366/&gt;

Both the United States and Australia cited the alliance as justification for involvement in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=Blaxland138/&gt; U.S. membership in SEATO provided the United States with a rationale for a large-scale U.S. military intervention in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=Maga/&gt; Other countries, such as the UK and key nations in Asia, accepted the rationale.&lt;ref name=Maga/&gt; In 1962, as part of its commitment to SEATO, the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] deployed [[CAC Sabre]]s of its [[No. 79 Squadron RAAF|No. 79 Squadron]] to [[Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base]], Thailand. The Sabres began to play a role in the Vietnam War in 1965, when their air defence responsibilities expanded to include protection of [[United States Air Force|USAF]] aircraft using Ubon as a base for strikes against North Vietnam.&lt;ref name=Stephens36&gt;{{harvnb|Stephens|1995|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Independent Review Panel|title=Report to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence|date=9 July 2004|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/medals/Content/+060%20Reviews%20and%20Reports/Complete%20Ubon%20Report.pdf|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural effects==
[[File:seatostamp.jpg|thumb|right|150px|alt=A picture of a U.S. postage stamp bearing the SEATO emblem|A [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States|1960 U.S. Postage Stamp]] for SEATO]]
In addition to joint military training, SEATO member states worked on improving mutual social and economic issues.&lt;ref name=Franklin183&gt;{{harvnb|Franklin|2006|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such activities were overseen by SEATO's Committee of Information, Culture, Education, and Labor Activities, and proved to be some of SEATO's greatest successes.&lt;ref name=Franklin183/&gt; In 1959, SEATO's first Secretary General, Pote Sarasin, created the [[Asian Institute of Technology|SEATO Graduate School of Engineering]] (currently the Asian Institute of Technology) in Thailand to train engineers.&lt;ref name=Franklin186/&gt; SEATO also sponsored the creation of the Teacher Development Center in Bangkok, as well as the Thai Military Technical Training School, which offered technical programs for supervisors and workmen.&lt;ref name=Franklin188&gt;{{harvnb|Franklin|2006|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; SEATO's Skilled Labor Project (SLP) created artisan training facilities, especially in Thailand, where ninety-one training workshops were established.&lt;ref name=Franklin188/&gt;

SEATO also provided research funding and grants in agriculture and medical fields.&lt;ref name=Franklin189&gt;{{harvnb|Franklin|2006|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, SEATO set up the Cholera Research Laboratory in Bangkok, later establishing a second Cholera Research Laboratory in [[Dhaka|Dhaka, Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name=Franklin189/&gt; The Dhaka laboratory soon became the world's leading [[cholera]] research facility and was later renamed the [[International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Franklin|2006|pp=189–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; SEATO was also interested in literature, and a SEATO Literature Award was created and given to writers from member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ppat.dbp.gov.my/ppat2001/trislipa.htm|title=Literary Trends and Literary Promotions in Thailand|last=Boonkhachorn|first=Trislipa|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and dissolution==
Though Secretary of State Dulles considered SEATO an essential element in U.S. foreign policy in Asia, historians have considered the Manila Pact a failure and the pact is rarely mentioned in history books.&lt;ref name=Franklin1/&gt; In ''The Geneva Conference of 1954 on Indochina'', [[James Cable|Sir James Cable]], a diplomat and naval strategist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1359279/Sir-James-Cable.html|title=Sir James Cable|date=13 October 2001|work=www.telegraph.co.uk|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; described SEATO as "a fig leaf for the nakedness of American policy", citing the Manila Pact as a "zoo of [[paper tiger]]s".&lt;ref name=Franklin1/&gt;

Consequently, questions of dissolving the organization arose. Pakistan withdrew in 1972, after East Pakistan seceded and became Bangladesh on 26 March 1971.&lt;ref name=Page548/&gt; France withdrew financial support in 1975,&lt;ref name=EB60/&gt; and the SEATO council agreed to the phasing out of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thai given mandate to dissolve SEATO |author= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0lQ0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YbkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3661%2C2633318 |newspaper=The Montreal Gazette |date=25 September 1975 |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a final exercise on 20 February 1976, the organization was formally dissolved on 30 June 1977.&lt;ref name=EB60/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almc.army.mil/ALU_INTERNAT/CountryNotes/PACOM/THAILAND.pdf |title=Thailand |author= |date= |work=Army Logistics University |publisher=[[United States Army]] |accessdate=6 July 2012 |quote=Despite the dissolution of the SEATO in 1977, the Manila Pact remains in force and, together with the Thanat-Rusk communiqué of 1962, constitutes the basis of U.S. security commitments to Thailand. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502004607/http://www.almc.army.mil/ALU_INTERNAT/CountryNotes/PACOM/THAILAND.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association of Southeast Asian Nations was founded on the structure and membership of the original SEATO members in Southeast Asia to later include Communist states.

[[File:Dedication page of The Rape of Lucrece by William Shakespeare 1594.jpg|thumb|Shakespeare's printed signature as it appears in ''The Rape of Lucrece'', printed by fellow Stratfordian [[Richard Field (printer)|Richard Field]]]]

The spelling of [[William Shakespeare]]'s name has varied over time. It was not consistently spelled any single way during his lifetime, in manuscript or in printed form. After his death the name was spelled variously by editors of his work, and the spelling was not fixed until well into the 20th century.

The standard spelling of the surname as "Shakespeare" was the most common published form in Shakespeare's lifetime, but it was not one used in his own handwritten signatures. It was, however, the spelling used by the author as a printed signature to the dedications of the first editions of his poems ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' and ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]''. It is also the spelling used in the [[First Folio]], the definitive collection of his plays published in 1623, after his death.

The spelling of the name was later modernised, "Shakespear" gaining popular usage in the 18th century, which was largely replaced by "Shakspeare" from the late 18th through the early 19th century. In the Romantic and Victorian eras the spelling "Shakspere", as used in the poet's own signature, became more widely adopted in the belief that this was the most authentic version. From the mid-19th to the early 20th century, a wide variety of spellings were used for various reasons; although, following the publication of the Cambridge and Globe editions of Shakespeare in the 1860s, "Shakespeare" began to gain ascendancy. It later became a habit of writers who believed that [[Shakespeare authorship question|someone else wrote the plays]] to use different spellings when they were referring to the "real" playwright and to the man from [[Stratford upon Avon]]. With rare exceptions, the spelling is now standardised in English-speaking countries as "Shakespeare".

There are six surviving signatures written by Shakespeare himself. These are all attached to legal documents. The six signatures appear on four documents:
 
* a deposition in the ''[[Bellott v Mountjoy|Bellott v. Mountjoy]]'' case, dated 11 May 1612
* the purchase of a house in [[Blackfriars, London]], dated 10 March 1613  
* the mortgage of the same house, dated 11 March 1613
* his Last Will &amp; Testament, which contains three signatures, one on each page, dated 25 March 1616

The signatures appear as follows:

*Willm Shakp 
*William Shaksper 
*Wm Shakspe 
*William Shakspere 
*Willm Shakspere 
*By me William Shakspeare

Most of these are abbreviated versions of the name, using [[breviograph]]ic conventions of the time. This was common practice. For example [[Edmund Spenser]] sometimes wrote his name out in full (spelling his first name Edmund or Edmond), but often used the abbreviated forms "Ed: spser" or "Edm: spser".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Charles Hamilton (ed), ''The Spenser Encyclopedia'', University of Toronto Press, 1990, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The three signatures on the will were first reproduced by the 18th-century scholar [[George Steevens]], in the form of facsimile engravings. The two relating to the house sale were identified in 1768, and the document itself was acquired by [[Edmond Malone]]. Photographs of these five signatures were published by [[Sidney Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Lee, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=B1UUcEzAKXgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Shakespeare's Handwriting: Facsimiles of the Five Authentic Autograph Signatures]'', London, Smith Elder, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; The final signature was discovered by 1909 by [[Charles William Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Charles William, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=B0hFAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Shakespeare and his London Associates]," ''Nebraska University Studies'', October 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a signature on the fly-leaf of a copy of [[John Florio]]'s translation of the works of Montaigne, which reads "Willm. Shakspere". This is no longer considered genuine, but was accepted by some scholars until the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion, 1550–1950'', Funk &amp; Wagnalls, New York, 1952 pp. 209, 424.&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibly authentic signature appears on a copy of [[William Lambarde]]'s ''Archaionomia'' (1568). Though smudged, the spelling appears to be "Shakspere".&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Schoenbaum|Schoenbaum, Samuel]]. ''William Shakespeare: Records and Images''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1981, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other spellings==
[[File:Shakespeare monument plaque.JPG|thumb|The memorial plaque on Shakespeare's tomb in the [[Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon]]. His name is spelled "Shakspeare". Next to it, the inscription on the grave of his widow [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare)|Anne Hathaway]] calls her the "wife of William Shakespeare".]]
The writer David Kathman has tabulated the variations in the spelling of Shakespeare's name as reproduced in [[Samuel Schoenbaum]]'s ''William Shakespeare: A Documentary Life''. He states that of "non-literary references" in Shakespeare's lifetime (1564–1616) the spelling "Shakespeare" appears 71 times, while "Shakespere" appears second with 27 usages. These are followed by "Shakespear" (16); "Shakspeare" (13); "Shackspeare" (12) and "Shakspere" (8). There are also many other variations that appear in small numbers or as one-offs.&lt;ref name = "kath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shakespeareauthorship.com/name1.html |title=David Kathman, The Spelling and Pronunciation of Shakespeare's Name |publisher=Shakespeareauthorship.com |date= |accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

R.C. Churchill notes that such variations were far from unusual:

{{quote|The name of Sir Walter Raleigh was written by his contemporaries either Raleigh, Raliegh, Ralegh, Raghley, Rawley, Rawly, Rawlie, Rawleigh, Raulighe, Raughlie, or Rayly. The name of Thomas Dekker was written either Dekker, Decker, Deckar, Deckers, Dicker, Dickers, Dyckers, or (interestingly enough) Dickens.&lt;ref name = "church"/&gt;}}

Kathman notes that the spelling is typically more uniform in printed versions than in manuscript versions, and that there is a greater variety of spelling in provincial documents than in metropolitan ones.&lt;ref name = "kath"/&gt;

==Printed spellings==
[[File:Loves labours tp.jpg|thumb|The title page of the 1598 edition of ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' in which the name is spelled "Shakeſpere", using a [[long s]] in the middle.]]

Fifty-eight [[quarto]] (or ''Q'') editions of Shakespeare's plays and five editions of poetry were published before the [[First Folio]]. On 20 of the plays, the author is not credited. On 15 title pages, his name is hyphenated, "Shake{{nbh}}speare", 13 of these spellings being on the title pages of just three plays, ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' ([[Early texts of Shakespeare's works|Q2]] 1598, Q3 1598, Q4 1608, and Q5 1615), ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' (Q2 1598, Q3 1602, Q4 1605, Q5 1612, and Q6 1622), and ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' (Q2 1599, Q3 1604, Q4 1608, and Q5 1613).{{sfn|Matus|1994|p=28}} A hyphen is also present in the first quarto of ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1602) and the second of ''[[King Lear]]'' (1619). The name printed at the end of the poem ''[[The Phoenix and the Turtle]]'', which was published in a collection of verse in 1601, is hyphenated, as is the name on the title page of ''[[Shakespeare's sonnets|Shake-speares Sonnets]]'' (1609). It is used in the [[Cast member|cast list]] of Ben Jonson's ''[[Sejanus His Fall]]'', and in six literary [[allusion]]s published between 1594 and 1623.&lt;ref name = Haney1&gt;John Louis Haney, ''The Name of William Shakespeare'', Egerton, 1906, pp. 27–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The un-hyphenated spelling "Shakespeare" (or Shakeſpeare, with a [[long s]]) appears on 22 of the 58 quartos.&lt;ref name = "kath"/&gt; It is spelled this way in the first quartos of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (1600), ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1600), ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' (1600), ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' (1602), ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' (1609), ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' (1609), ''[[Othello]]'' (1622). The second, or "good", quarto of ''Hamlet'' (1604) also uses this spelling. It is also spelled this way on the misattributed quarto of ''[[Sir John Oldcastle]]'' (1600; 1619) and on the verse collection ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim]]'' (1599).&lt;ref name = Haney1/&gt;

Rarer spellings are "Shak{{nbh}}speare" on the first quarto of ''King Lear'' (1608), and "Shakeſpere", in the first quarto of ''Love's Labour's Lost'' (1598). On the misattributed quarto ''[[A Yorkshire Tragedy]]'' (1608) his name is spelled "Shakſpeare", a spelling that also appears on the quarto of ''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'' (1634), which was published after the First Folio.&lt;ref name = Haney1/&gt;
 
[[James S. Shapiro]] argues that Shakespeare's name was a "typesetter's nightmare" if the spelling without the central "e" is adopted. This is because the conjunction of letters in [[moveable type]] is liable to damage the type, "When setting a "k" followed by a long "s" in italic font—with the name Shakspeare, for example—the two letters could easily collide and the font might snap". He suggests that this is one reason why the form with the "e" in the centre is most commonly used, and why it is sometimes hyphenated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kathman argues that any name that could be divided into two clear parts was liable to be hyphenated, especially if the parts could be interpreted as distinct words.&lt;ref name = "kath"/&gt;

==Spellings in later publications==
[[File:Third folio.JPG|thumb|left|The additional plays section in the 1664 Third Folio, using the spelling that was preferred in the [[Augustan literature|English Augustan era]].]] 
Later editions of Shakespeare's works adopted differing spellings, in accordance with fashions of modernised spelling of the day, or, later, of attempts to adopt what was believed to be the most historically accurate version of the name. When he was referred to in foreign languages, he acquired even more variant spellings. 18th-century French critics were known to use "Shakpear, Shakespehar, Shakespeart, or Shakees Pear."&lt;ref name = "church"&gt;R.C. Churchill, ''Shakespeare and His Betters: A History and a Criticism of the Attempts Which Have Been Made to Prove That Shakespeare's Works Were Written by Others'', Max Reinhardt, London, 1958, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shakespear===
A shift from "Shakespeare" to the modernised spelling "Shakespear" occurs in the second printing of the [[Third Folio]], published in 1664 by [[Philip Chetwinde]]. This retained the original title page, but included a section with additional plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shakes.meisei-u.ac.jp/e-third.html |title=Meisei University Shakespeare database |publisher=Shakes.meisei-u.ac.jp |date=31 August 2007 |accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title page of this new add-on adopted the new spelling.&lt;ref name = "haney"/&gt; It was also adopted by other authors of the [[Restoration literature|Restoration Era]]. [[John Downes (prompter)|John Downes]] and [[Nahum Tate]] both use the spelling.&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton Spencer, ''Shakespeare Improved: The Restoration Versions in Quarto and on the Stage'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by 18th-century writers. Shakespeare's first biographer, [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]], also spelled the name "Shakespear", in his book ''Some Account of the Life &amp;c. of Mr. William Shakespear'' (1709) and in his new edition of the works. This spelling was followed by [[Alexander Pope]] in his edition of the ''Works of Shakespear'' (1725) and [[George Sewell (controversialist)|George Sewell]] (''The Works of Mr. William Shakespear'').&lt;ref name = "jarvis"&gt;Simon Jarvis, ''Scholars and Gentlemen: Shakespearian Textual Criticism and Representations of Scholarly Labour, 1725–1765'', Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling with an "e" at the end persisted, however. Pope's rival [[Lewis Theobald]] retained it in his edition, ''Shakespeare Restored'' (1726), which pointedly rejected attempts to modernise and sanitise the original works.&lt;ref&gt;Theobald adopts Pope's spelling in ''An Answer to Mr. Pope's Preface to Shakespear'', Jarvis, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Shakespear" spelling continued to be used by scholars throughout the 18th century, including [[William Warburton]]. However, many, like Theobald, preferred the First Folio spelling, most notably [[Samuel Johnson]].&lt;ref name = "jarvis"/&gt; "Shakespear" was less widely used into the 19th and 20th centuries, increasingly by advocates of [[English language spelling reform|rational spelling]]. [[William Hazlitt]] used it in his book ''[[Characters of Shakespear's Plays]]''. [[George Bernard Shaw]], a strong advocate of spelling reform, insisted on the use of this spelling in all his publications.&lt;ref name = "haney"/&gt;

===Archaising spellings===

====Shakspeare====
[[File:MaloneAttempttitlepage.jpg|thumb|[[Edmond Malone]] used the spelling "Shakspeare", which was most common in the Georgian era.]]
Archival material relating to Shakespeare was first identified by 18th-century scholars, most notably Edmond Malone, who recorded variations in the spelling of the name. Malone declared a preference for the spelling "Shakspeare", using it in his major publications including his 1790 sixteen-volume edition of the complete works of the playwright. [[George Steevens]] also used this spelling. Steevens and Malone had both examined Shakespeare's will, and were convinced that the final signature was spelled this way, which also conformed to the spelling used on [[Shakespeare's funerary monument|Shakespeare's tomb]]. However, Malone admitted that the signature was difficult to read and that the others were clearly spelled without the final "a".&lt;ref name = "haney"/&gt; This spelling continued to be popular throughout the later [[Georgian period]]. Indeed "virtually every edition" of the playwright's work in the early 19th century before 1840 used this spelling. Even German scholars such as [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] and [[Ludwig Tieck]] adopted it.&lt;ref name = "haney"&gt;John Louis Haney, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TPgjAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Name of William Shakespeare: a Study in Orthography]'', Egerton, 1906, pp. 42–50&lt;/ref&gt;

The antiquarian [[Joseph Hunter (antiquarian)|Joseph Hunter]] was the first to publish all known variations of the spelling of the name, which he did in 1845 in his book ''Illustrations of the Life, Studies, and Writings of Shakespeare''. He gives an account of what was known at the time of the history of the name of Shakespeare, and lists all its variant forms, including the most idiosyncratic instances such as "Shagsper" and "Saxpere". He linked this to a history of the Shakespeare family and its descendants, though he was not able to add much to the material already identified by Edmond Malone.&lt;ref&gt;Charles F. Johnson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cIRlAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Shakespeare and His Critics]'', Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1909, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter noted that "there has been endless variety in the form in which this name has been written." He criticised Malone and Steevens, writing that "in an evil hour they agreed, for no apparent reason, to abolish the e in the first syllable."&lt;ref name = "hunt"&gt;Joseph Hunter, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tnYLAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Illustrations of the Life, Studies, and Writings of Shakespeare]'', London, Nichols, 1845, pp. 5–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter argued that there were probably two pronunciations of the name, a Warwickshire version and a London version, so that "the poet himself might be called by his honest neighbours at Stratford and Shottery, Mr. Shaxper, while his friends in London honoured him, as we know historically they did, with the more stately name of Shakespeare." Kathman argues that while it is possible that different pronunciations existed, there is no good reason to think so on the basis of spelling variations.&lt;ref name = "kath"/&gt;

====Shakspere====
[[File:Knight-1867.JPG|thumb|Title page of Knight's ''Pictorial Shakspere'', 1867 edition.]]
According to Hunter it was in 1785 that the antiquarian [[John Pinkerton]] first revived the spelling "Shakspere" in the belief that this was the correct form as "traced by the poet's own hand" in his signatures.&lt;ref name = "hunt"/&gt; Pinkerton did so in ''Letters on Literature'', published under the pen-name Robert Heron.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Heron, ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EUsJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=%22john+pinkerton%22+shakspere&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YBRxifS5q9&amp;sig=8BWAzTdMKUlkMiMWgdK3CWQkJXo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Yo-9TbnxEpKahQfg-tS2BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=shakespear&amp;f=falseLetters on Literature]'', London, Robinson, 1785. Pinkerton gives no explanation for his adoption of the spelling. The surmise is Hunter's.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a later scholar identified a reference in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' in 1784 to the deplorable "new fashion of writing Shakespeare's name SHAKSPERE", which suggests that the trend had been emerging since Steevens published facsimiles of the signatures in 1778.&lt;ref name = "haney"/&gt; Nevertheless, Pinkerton gave it wide circulation. The "Shakspere" spelling was quickly adopted by a number of writers and in 1788 was given official status by the London publisher Bell in its editions of the plays.&lt;ref name = "haney"/&gt; [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who published a large quantity of influential literature on the playwright, used both this and the "Shakspeare" spelling. His major works were published after his death with the new spelling.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. Raysor, "Coleridge's Manuscript Lectures", ''Modern Philology'', 1924, pp. 17–25.&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling continued to be preferred by many writers during the Victorian era, including the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in ''[[The Germ (periodical)|The Germ]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Germ: The Literary Magazine of the Pre-Raphaelites'', 1998, facsimile reprint, Ashmoleon Museum, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

The matter was widely debated. ''The Gentleman's Magazine'' became the forum for discussion of the topic. There was a heated debate in 1787, followed by another in 1840 when the spelling was promoted in a book by [[Frederic Madden]], who insisted that new manuscript evidence proved that the poet always wrote his name "Shakspere". [[Isaac D'Israeli]] wrote a strongly worded letter condemning this spelling as a "barbaric curt shock". There followed a lengthy correspondence, mainly between John Bruce, who insisted on "Shakspere" because "a man's own mode of spelling his own name ought to be followed" and John William Burgon, who argued that "names are to be spelt as they are spelt in the printed books of the majority of well-educated persons", insisting that this rule authorised the spelling "Shakspeare". Various other contributors added to the debate.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gentleman's Magazine'', Volume 13, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other articles covered the spelling dispute in the 19th century, in which the "Shakspere" spelling generally was promoted on the grounds that it was the poet's own. [[Albert Richard Smith]] in the satirical magazine ''The Month'' claimed that the controversy was finally "set to rest" by the discovery of a manuscript which proved that the spelling changed with the weather, "When the sun shone he made his 'A's, / When wet he took his 'E's."&lt;ref&gt;Albert Smith &amp; [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tKVbAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Month, a view of passing subjects and manners]'', London, 1851, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879 ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article on the dispute, reporting on a pamphlet by [[James Halliwell-Phillipps]] attacking the "Shakspere" trend.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;''[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1879/12/27/93908122.pdf New York Times]'', 27 December 1879.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the most important Victorian Shakespeare publishers and scholars used this spelling, including [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]], whose ''The Pictorial Edition of the Works of Shakspere'' was very popular, and [[Edward Dowden]], in ''Shakspere: a critical study of his mind and art''. In Britain the [[New Shakspere Society]] was founded in 1873 by [[Frederick James Furnivall]] and, in America, the Shakspere Society of Philadelphia adopted the spelling. The former folded in 1894, but the latter still exists under its original name.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Kozusko, "[http://www.borrowers.uga.edu/cocoon/borrowers/request?id=781462 Borrowers and Lenders]," ''The Journal of Shakespeare and Appropriation'', The Shakspere Society of Philadelphia, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling was still common in the early to mid 20th century, for example in Brander Matthews', ''Shakspere as a Playwright'' (1913),&lt;ref&gt;Brander Matthews, ''Shakspere as a Playwright'', Scribner's Sons, New York, 1913&lt;/ref&gt; Alwin Thaler's ''Shakspere to Sheridan'' (1922),&lt;ref&gt;Alwin Thaler, ''Shakspere to Sheridan: A Book about the Theatre of Yesterday and To-Day'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; and T.W. Baldwin's ''Shakspere's five-act structure'' (1947).&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Nosworthy, review in ''The Review of English Studies'', Oxford, 1949, pp. 359–361.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shakespeare===
The spelling "Shakespeare" was vigorously defended by Isaac D'Israeli in his original letter to the ''Gentleman's Magazine''. Joseph Hunter also expressly stated it to be the most appropriate spelling. D'Israeli argued that the printed spellings of the poems would have been chosen by the author. He also insisted that the spelling represents the proper pronunciation, evidenced by puns on the words "shake" and "spear" in Shakespeare's contemporaries. Hunter also argued that the spelling should follow established pronunciation and pointed to the poems, stating that "we possess ''printed evidence'' tolerably uniform from the person himself" supporting "Shakespeare".&lt;ref name = "hunt"/&gt;

Although Dowden, the most influential voice in Shakespearean criticism in the last quarter of the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1989|p=186}}.&lt;/ref&gt; used the spelling "Shakspere", between 1863 and 1866 the nine-volume ''The Works of William Shakespeare'', edited by [[William George Clark]], John Glover, and [[William Aldis Wright]], all Fellows of Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, had been published by the university. This edition (soon generally known as "The Cambridge Shakespeare") spelled the name "Shakespeare". A related edition, including Shakespeare's text from the Cambridge Shakespeare but without the scholarly apparatus, was issued in 1864 as "The Globe Edition". This became so popular that it remained in print and established itself as a standard text for almost a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1989|p=185}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the ubiquity and authority of the Cambridge and Globe editions, backed by the impeccable academic credentials of the Cambridge editors, the spelling of the name as "Shakespeare" soon dominated in publications of works by and about Shakespeare. Although this form had been used occasionally in earlier publications, and other spellings continued to appear, from that point "Shakespeare" gained the dominance which it retains to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1989|p=191}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shakespeare authorship question==
[[File:King Lear Q1.jpg|thumb|left|Title page of the first quarto of ''[[King Lear]]'' (1608) with a hyphenated spelling of the name.]]
When the advocates of the [[Shakespeare authorship question]] began to claim that someone other than Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the plays, they drew on the fact that variant spellings existed to distinguish between the supposed pseudonym used by the hidden author and the name of the man born in Stratford, who is claimed to have acted as a "front man".&lt;ref name = "church"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ironically, the first anti-Stratfordian book uses the "Shakspere" spelling, [[Delia Bacon]]'s ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2i5DAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakspere Unfolded]'', London, Groombridge, 1857.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of different spellings was sometimes simply a convenience, to clarify which "Shakespeare" was being discussed. In other cases it was linked to an argument about the meaning supposed to be attached to "Shakespeare" as a pseudonym. In some instances it arose from a belief that different spelling literally implied, as R.C. Churchill puts it, "that there must have been two men: one, the actor, whom they mostly call 'Shaksper' or 'Shakspere', the other the real author (Bacon, Derby, Rutland, etc.) whom they call 'Shakespeare' or 'Shake-speare' (with the hyphen)." In some cases there were even imagined to be three Shakespeares: the author, the actor and the Stratford man.&lt;ref name = "church"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Percy Allen, ''Anne Cecil, Elizabeth &amp; Oxford: A Study of Relations between these three, with the Duke of Alencon added; based mainly upon internal evidence, drawn from (Chapman's?) A Lover's Complaint; Lord Oxford's (and others) A Hundreth Sundrie Flowers; Spenser's Faery Queen''..., Archer, 1934; Graf Vitzthum, Shakespeare und Shakspere, p. 5ff; [[Louis P. Bénézet]], ''Shakspere, Shakespeare and de Vere'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of spelling for the Stratford man varied. Because he is known to have signed his name "Shakspere" when writing it out in full, this is the spelling sometimes adopted. However, H.N. Gibson notes that outlandish spellings seem sometimes to be chosen purely for the purpose of ridiculing him, by making the name seem vulgar and rustic, a characteristic especially typical of Baconians such as [[Edwin Durning-Lawrence]]:

{{quote|This hatred [of the Stratford man] not only takes the form of violent abuse and the accusation of every kind of disreputable conduct, but also of the rather childish trick of hunting up all the most outlandish Elizabethan variations of the spelling of his name, and filling their pages with "Shagspur", "Shaxpers", and similar atrocities; while Sir Edwin Durning-Lawrence concludes each chapter in his book with the legend "Bacon is Shakespeare" in block capitals.&lt;ref&gt;H.N. Gibson, ''The Shakespeare Claimants: A Critical Survey of the Four Principal Theories concerning the Authorship of the Shakespearean Plays'', Barnes &amp; Noble, New York, 1962, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Some authors claim that the use of a hyphen in early published versions of the name is an indication that it is a pseudonym.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2010|p=255 (225)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that fictional descriptive names (such as "Master Shoe-tie" and "Sir Luckless Woo-all") were often hyphenated in plays, and pseudonyms such as "Tom Tell-truth" were also sometimes hyphenated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Price|2001|pp=59–62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kathman argues that this is not the case, and that real names are as likely to be hyphenated as pseudonyms.&lt;ref name = "kath"/&gt; He states that the pseudonym "[[Martin Marprelate]]" is sometimes hyphenated, but usually not. [[Robert Waldegrave]], who printed the [[Marprelate controversy|Marprelate tracts]], never hyphenated the name, but did hyphenate his own: "If hyphenation was supposed to indicate a pseudonym, it is curious that Waldegrave repeatedly hyphenated his own name while failing to hyphenate an undisputed pseudonym in the same texts."&lt;ref name = "kath"/&gt;

{{Business administration}}

A '''supervisory board''' or '''supervisory committee''', often called ''[[board of directors]]'', is a group of individuals chosen by the [[stockholder]]s of a [[corporation|company]] to promote their interests through the governance of the company and to hire and supervise the executive directors and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]].

[[Corporate governance]] varies between countries, especially regarding the board system. There are countries that have a one-tier board system (like the U.S.) and there are others that have a [[Board of directors#Two-tier system|two-tier board system]] like Germany.

In a one-tier board, all the directors (both [[executive director]]s as well as [[non-executive director]]s) form one board, called the board of directors.

In a two-tier board there is an executive board (all executive directors) and a separate supervisory board (all non-executive directors).

== Germany ==
German corporation law, the ''Aktiengesetz'', requires all public companies (''[[Aktiengesellschaft]]en'') to have two boards:
a management board called a ''[[Vorstand]]'' and a supervisory board called an ''Aufsichtsrat''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In Germany the supervisory board of large corporations is composed of 20 members, 10 of whom are elected by the shareholders, the other 10 being employee representatives.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The supervisory board oversees and appoints the members of the management board and must approve major business decisions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

When a German company has between 500-2,000 employees, the minimum of members a board can consist of is three, and the maximum is 21.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The number of members has to be divisible by three, as stated in the law. In such companies, the workers select one-third of the supervisory board.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

When it comes to internal elections the chairman of supervisory board, the ''Aufsichtsratsvorsitzender'', has two votes in case of a draw.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The supervisory board, in theory, is intended to provide a [[Monitoring and Evaluation|monitoring]] role. However, the appointment of supervisory board members has not been a transparent process and has therefore led to inefficient monitoring and poor corporate governance in some cases (Monks and Minow, 2001).
The discussion about whether a one-tier or a two-tier board system leads to better corporate governance is ongoing in Germany and many other countries. Improvements in corporate governance are often the result of shareholders (such as active private investors or activist investment funds) holding boards (whether one- or two-tier) of companies in which they invest to account.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== China ==
Another example of a two-tier board system: Mainland China

In China's corporation law, the so-called (中华人民共和国公司法), it stipulates a limited liability company (有限责任公司) to have: a board of directors (董事会) and a board of supervisors (监事会).
Regarding the Chinese requirements of a board of supervisors, under Articles 52 to 57 of the Company Law of the People's Republic of China:

*a limited liability company requires to set up a board of supervisors, which shall comprise at least 3 persons. A limited liability company, which has relatively less shareholders or is relatively small in scale, may have 1 or 2 supervisors, and does not have to establish a board of supervisors. The board of supervisors shall include representatives of shareholders and representatives of the employees of the company at an appropriate ratio which shall be specifically stimulated in the Articles of Association. The employees' representatives, who are to serve as members of the board of supervisors, shall be democratically elected by the employees of the company through the meeting of the employees' representatives or employees' meeting, or by any other means. The board of supervisors shall have one chairman, who shall be elected by half or more of all the supervisors. The chairman of the board of supervisors shall convene and preside over the meetings of the board of supervisors. If the chairman of the board of supervisors is unable to or does not perform his duties, the supervisor recommended by half or more of the supervisors shall convene and preside over the meetings of the board of supervisors. No director or senior manager may concurrently work as a supervisor.
*Every term of office of the supervisors shall be 3 years. The supervisors may, after the expiry of their term of office, hold a consecutive term upon re-election. If no reelection is timely carried out after the expiry of the term of office of the supervisors, or the number of the members of the board of supervisors is less than the quorum due to the resignation of some directors from the board of supervisors prior to the expiry of their term of office, the original supervisors shall, before the newly elected supervisors assume their posts, exercise the authorities of the supervisors according to laws, administrative regulations as well as the articles of association.
*The board of supervisors or supervisor of a company with no board of supervisors may exercise the following authorities: (1) checking the financial affairs of the company; (2) supervising the duty-related acts of the directors and senior managers, and bringing forward proposals on the removal of any director or senior manager who violates any law, administrative regulation, the articles of association or any resolution of the shareholders' meeting; (3) demanding any director or senior manager to make corrections if his act has injured the interests of the company; (4) proposing to convening temporary shareholders' meetings, and convening and presiding over shareholders' meetings when the board of directors does not exercise the functions of convening and presiding over the shareholders' meetings as prescribed in this Law; (5) bringing forward proposals at shareholders' meetings; (6) initiating actions against directors or senior managers according to other relevant Article of this Law; and (7) other duties as prescribed by the Articles of Association.
*The supervisors may attend the meetings of the board of directors as non-voting delegates, and may raise questions or suggestions on the matters to be decided by the board of directors. If the board of supervisors or supervisor of the company with no board of directors finds that the company is running abnormally, it (he) may make investigations. Where necessary, it (he) may hire an accounting firm to help it (him), with the relevant expenses being borne by the company.
*The board of supervisors shall hold meetings at least once a year. The supervisors may propose to hold temporary meetings of the board of supervisors. The discussion methods and voting procedures of the board of supervisors shall be prescribed in the articles of association, unless it is otherwise stimulated in this Law. The resolution of the board of supervisors shall be adopted by half or more of the supervisors. The board of supervisors shall make records for the resolutions on the matter it discusses, which shall be signed by the supervisors in presence.
*The expenses necessary for the board of supervisors or the supervisor of a company with no board of supervisors to perform its (his) duties shall be borne by the company.

A '''treasurer''' is the person responsible for running the [[treasury]] of an organization. The adjective for a treasurer is normally "tresorial." The adjective "treasurial" normally means pertaining to a treasury, rather than the treasurer. The significant core functions of a corporate treasurer include cash and liquidity management, risk management, and corporate finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury-management.com/showarticle.php?pubid=4&amp;issueid=121&amp;article=1053&amp;page=showarticle&amp;pageno=1|title=The Functions of a Corporate Treasury|last=Degenhart|first=Dr. Heinrich|date=|website=www.treasury-management.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
{{see also|State treasurer}}
The [[treasury]] of a country is the department responsible for the country's [[economy]], [[finance]] and [[revenue]]. The treasurer is generally the head of the Treasury, although, in some countries (such as the United Kingdom or the United States) the treasurer reports to a [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] or [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. In [[Australia]], the [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] is a senior [[Minister (government)|Minister]] and usually the second most important member of the [[Executive (government)|Government]] after the [[Prime Minister]].

From 1867 to 1993, [[Ministry of Finance (Ontario)|Ontario's Minister of Finance]] was called the Treasurer of Ontario.

Originally the word referred to the person in charge of the [[treasure]] of a [[nobility|noble]]; however, it has now moved into wider use.  In the UK during the 17th Century, a position of [[Lord High Treasurer]] was used on several occasions as the third great officer of [[the Crown]].  Now the title [[First Lord of the Treasury]] is the official title of the British [[Prime Minister]].

==In the Inns of Court==
In the [[Inns of Court]], the professional associations for [[barristers in England and Wales|barristers]] in [[England]] and [[Wales]], the ''[[bencher]]'' or ''Master of the bench'' who heads the Inn for that year holds the title 'Master Treasurer'. This title is similarly used by other legal associations sharing a British heritage, such as the [[Law Society of Upper Canada]].

== Volunteer organizations ==
Many volunteer organizations, particularly [[not-for-profit]] organizations such as [[charities]] and [[theaters]], appoint treasurers who are responsible for conservation of the treasury, whether this be through pricing of a product, organizing [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]], or arranging fundraising events.

The treasurer would also be part of the group which would oversee how the money is spent, either directly dictating expenditure or authorizing it as required. It is their responsibility to ensure that the organization has enough money to carry out their stated aims and objectives, and that they do not overspend, or under spend. They also report to the board meetings and/or to the general membership the financial status of the organization to ensure checks and balances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Robert's Rules of Order]] Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 461, 477-480|edition = 11th|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accurate records and supporting documentation must be kept to a reasonable level of detail that provides a clear audit trail for all transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief|last = Robert III|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82019-9|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 153-155|edition = 2nd|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/inbrief.html|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USAT ''Buford''''' was a combination cargo/passenger ship, originally launched in 1890 as the '''SS ''Mississippi'''''. She was purchased by the [[US Army]] in 1898 for transport duty in the Spanish–American War. In 1919, she was briefly transferred to the [[US Navy]], commissioned as the '''USS ''Buford'' (ID 3818)''', to repatriate troops home after World War I, and then later that year returned to the Army.

In December 1919, nicknamed the ''Soviet Ark'' (or the ''Red Ark'') by the press of the day, the Buford was used by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] and [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] to deport 249 non-citizens to Russia from the United States because of their alleged [[anarchism|anarchist]] or [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] political beliefs.

She was sold to private interests in 1923, contracted in mid-1924 to be the set for [[Buster Keaton]]'s silent film ''[[The Navigator (1924 film)|The Navigator]]'', and finally scrapped in 1929.

==Ship's history==

While under de facto American ownership, she would fly the British flag, due to the economies of the navigation laws of the period.&lt;ref name="kinghorn"&gt;{{Citation | title = The Atlantic Transport Line, 1881–1931: A History with Details on All Ships | last = Kinghorn | first = Jonathan | year = 2012 | publisher = McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers | location = Jefferson, North Carolina and London | ISBN = 978-0-7864-6142-4}}, p.103.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mississippi'' was launched on August 29, 1890&lt;ref name="bonsor"&gt;{{Citation | title = North Atlantic Seaway, vol.3 | last = Bonsor | first = Noel R.

For the first year of her career, the ''Mississippi'' plied the waters between [[London]], [[Swansea]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;The Baltimore Sun, "Port Paragraphs," Nov 28, 1890, pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1892, the ''Mississippi'' was moved to the London-New York route,&lt;ref name=bonsor/&gt; where she remained until she was purchased by the [[U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps|U.S. Army Quartermaster Department]] as part of a seven-ship deal on June 24, 1898, and became an army transport ship, serving in the [[Caribbean]] theater of the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B01EFDA1738E433A25756C2A9609C94699ED7CF&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=June+25%2C+1898+%2B+Mississippi&amp;st=p "Transports For The Army," June 25, 1898, p.2], accessed January 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mississippi'' was assigned the number "25" on July 5, 1898.&lt;ref&gt;The Baltimore Sun, "Rushing Troops South," Jul 6, 1898, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  However, she sailed under her given name until March 2, 1899, the following year, when she was officially renamed the USAT ''Buford'',&lt;ref&gt;The Baltimore Sun, "New Names For Auxiliary Ships," Mar 3, 1899, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  in honor of Gen.

On May 28, 1900,&lt;ref&gt;The Baltimore Sun, "Battleship Kentucky," May 29, 1900, pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Buford'' entered the naval yards of the Newport News Ship-Building Company for a major refitting as a troop-ship for service between the United States and the [[Philippine–American War|Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;''Richmond Dispatch'': [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038614/1900-05-25/ed-1/seq-1/ "Contract for Newport News," May 25, 1900, p.1], accessed January 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Two of her original four masts were removed; the other two were replaced with long masts.&lt;ref name=ATL/&gt; While under conversion, the ''Buford'' would miss the peak of the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. Once back in service in November of that year, the ''Buford'' took up regular service on the [[Pacific]] run from [[San Francisco]] to [[Honolulu]] and [[Guam]] terminating in [[Manila]], and returning via [[Nagasaki]] and [[Honolulu]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annual Reports of the War Department, Vol II, 1906'': [https://books.google.com/books?id=iZUdAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA28 "Regular Trans-Pacific Service" p.28], accessed January 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

At 5:12&amp;nbsp;a.m. on Wednesday, April 18, 1906, the ''Buford'' was in San Francisco when the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|
Great Quake of 1906]] struck. She was taken from the pier into the bay to avoid the resultant fire and was one of three transports - ''Buford'', ''Crook'' and ''Warren'' - used in the harbor as temporary storehouses for the supplies coming into the stricken city by sea in the weeks following the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;''Annual Reports of the War Department, Vol I, 1906'': [http://www.history.army.mil/documents/sfearthquake/GreelyReport.htm "EARTHQUAKE IN CALIFORNIA" - Special Report of Maj.

In September 1906, the ''Buford'' was sent to rescue over 600 passengers and crew from the [[SS Mongolia (1903)|SS ''Mongolia'']], which had pierced her hull after running aground at [[Midway Island]]. Before ''Buford'' arrived on the scene, the ''Mongolia's'' crew had freed her. However, the two ship captains determined it prudent to send the passengers back on ''Buford''. To ensure the safe arrival of ''Mongolia'''s crew, should the passenger steamer's bilge pumps fail to keep pace with the leaks, the ''Buford'' escorted her during the five-day return to Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Hawaiian Star |location=Honolulu, Hawaii |date=28 September 1906 |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015415/1906-09-28/ed-1/ |pages=1, 5 |title=Mongolia Comes Here Leaking/Passengers in Good Spirits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1918, the ''Buford'' underwent another refit to prepare her for transporting [[American Expeditionary Force]] troops home from [[World War I|the war]].

During the next half-year she made four round trip voyages between the United States and France, bringing home over 4700 soldiers. She made one more voyage to the [[Panama Canal Zone]] before she was decommissioned by the Navy on September 2, 1919 and returned to the [[Army Transport Service]].&lt;ref name=ATL/&gt;&lt;ref name="navsource"&gt;''NavSource Online - Section Patrol Craft Photo Archive'': [http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/173818.htm "USAT Buford - ex-USS Buford (ID 3818) - ex-USAT Buford"], accessed January 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deportations==
The ''Buford''{{'}}s most notorious incarnation followed a few months later when she was pressed into service as the "Soviet Ark" (or "Red Ark"). On December 21, 1919, she was used to deport 249 political radicals and other "undesirable" aliens, mostly members of the [[Union of Russian Workers]], to the [[Russian SFSR]]. Also swept up were the fiery anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]].&lt;ref name=sails/&gt; This occurred between the first and second [[Palmer Raids]] of the [[First Red Scare|first "Red Scare"]] period in the U.S. After delivering her charges, the ''Buford'' returned to New York on February 22, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1920/02/23/archives/soviet-ark-returns-buford-can-be-ready-for-another-load-of-reds-by.html "'Soviet Ark' Returns: Buford Can Be Ready for Another Load of Reds by Wednesday" February 23, 1920, p. 8], accessed January 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political context===
During the [[First Red Scare]] in 1919-20 following the Russian Revolution, anti-Bolshevik sentiment quickly replaced the anti-German sentiment of the World War I years. Many politicians and government officials, along with a large part of the press and the public, feared an imminent attempt to overthrow the government of the United States and the creation of a new regime modeled on that of the Soviets. In that atmosphere of public hysteria, radical views as well as moderate dissents were often characterized as un-American or subversive, including the advocacy of labor rights and any less than complementary discussion of American society and its system of government. Close ties between recent European immigrants and radical political ideas and organizations fed those anxieties as well.

The [[Espionage Act of 1917]] made it a crime to interfere with the operation or success of the armed forces of the United States. It effectively criminalized any act or speech that discouraged full compliance with the military draft. Convicted under this law, [[Eugene V. Debs]], a five-time presidential candidate, served 3 years of a 10-year sentence before [[Warren G. Harding|President Warren G. Harding]] commuted his sentence on Christmas Day, 1921. [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] were likewise convicted under the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]] and eventually deported. The [[Anarchist Exclusion Act#Immigration Act of 1918|Immigration Act of 1918]] denied entry into the U.S. and permitted the deportation of non-citizens "who disbelieve in or are opposed to all organized government."

===Voyage===

The ''Buford'' steamed out of [[New York Harbor|New York harbor]] at 6 A. M. on Sunday, December 21, 1919, with 249 "undesirables" on board. Of those, 199 had been seized in the November 7 Palmer Raids. Some were leftists or anarchists, though perhaps as many as 180 were deported because of their membership in the [[Union of Russian Workers]], an anarchist organization which served social and educational functions for many Russian immigrants, had been the principal target of the raids. Other deportees, including the well-known radical leaders [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]], had been detained earlier. All, by act or speech or membership in an organization, fell within the legal definition of anarchist under the [[Anarchist Exclusion Act#Immigration Act of 1918|Immigration Act of 1918]], which did not distinguish between "malignant conspirators and destructive revolutionists" on the one hand or "apostles of peace, preachers of the principle of non-resistance" on the other. All met the law's requirement in that they "believed that no government would be better for human society than any kind of government."&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{Citation | title = The Deportations Delirium of Nineteen-twenty: A Personal Narrative of an Historic Official Experience | last = Post | first = Louis F. | authorlink = Louis Freeland Post | year = 1923 | publisher = Charles H.

Not all the deportees were unhappy to be leaving the United States.

Twenty-four hours after its departure, the ''Buford'''s captain opened sealed orders to learn his projected destination. The captain only learned his final destination while in [[Kiel]] harbor while awaiting repairs and taking on a German pilot to guide the ship through the North Sea minefields, uncleared despite [[Armistice with Germany|Germany's surrender]] a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 6-11&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of State|State Department]] had found it difficult to make arrangements to land in [[Latvia]] as originally planned.

F.W. Berkshire, Supervising Inspector of Immigration, made the journey to oversee the enterprise and, in contrast to his two most famous charges, reported little conflict. A "strong detachment of marines" numbering 58 enlisted men and four officers also made the journey and pistols had been distributed to the crew.&lt;ref name=sails&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/12/21/archives/ark-with-300-reds-sails-early-today-for-unnamed-port-bufords.html "'Ark' with 300 Reds Sails Early Today for Unnamed Port," December 21, 1919], accessed February 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Post, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Buford'' reached [[Hanko]], [[Finland]] at 4:25 pm on Friday, January 16, 1920. The prisoners were kept between decks until they were landed the next day, Saturday, January 17, 1920, at 2 pm.

Finnish White Guards were stationed on each car platform. The party was to be completely isolated until it reached its destination. Once loaded, the train was then held overnight while rumors of the party being killed as they crossed the border caused a diplomatic flurry.&lt;ref name=Viborg/&gt;

The journey began the next day, January 18, but the exiles were sidetracked at [[Vyborg|Viborg]], Finland, remaining confined in their cars, while awaiting the British Prisoners' Relief Mission, which was to cross the Russian frontier at the same time. Delayed by storms, the ''Buford'' began her return voyage that same day.&lt;ref name=Viborg/&gt;

On January 19, the trek continued to Terijoki. Once the deportees had arrived, and after trudging through a heavy snowstorm, a parlay was conducted under white flags of truce between Berkman, guarded by the Finns, and the Russians, out on the ice of the frozen [[Sestra River (Leningrad Oblast)|Systerbak River]], which separated the Finnish and Bolshevist lines.

On May 2, 1921, once again in the Pacific, the ''Buford'' rescued sixty-five passengers and crew from the inferno of the Japanese steam freighter ''Tokuyo Maru'', which had caught fire and burned 60 miles southwest of the mouth of the Columbia River, off [[Tillamook Head]], Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, "One Dead, Seven Missing: Army Transport Rescues Sixty-five From Burning Jap Steamer," May 4, 1921, pg.

In mid 1922, as one of her final duties as a U. S. transport, the ''Buford'' conducted an inspection tour of Northwestern and Alaska Army posts and closed a number of posts in the territory abandoned by the [[United States Department of War|War Department]].&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, "Maj.-Gen. Morton Sails For Alaska," Jun 28, 1922, pg. I-15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the ''Buford'' was sold to John C. Ogden and Fred Linderman of the San Francisco-based Alaskan Siberian Navigation Company.&lt;ref name=ATL/&gt; After a voyage to Alaska and Siberia in the late summer of 1923 and another to the South Seas in early 1924, the ''Buford'' was chartered for three months by silent film comedian [[Buster Keaton]] for use as the principal set of his film ''[[The Navigator (1924 film)|The Navigator]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, "Deep Sea Comedy," May 11, 1924, pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Buford'' had been "discovered" by Keaton's Technical Director [[Fred Gabourie]] while scouting for ships for another, outside project, ''[[The Sea Hawk (1924 film)|The Sea Hawk]]''. Released on October 13, 1924, ''The Navigator'' proved to be Keaton's most financially successful film and one of his personal favorites. After this moment in the limelight, the ''Buford'' slipped into dormancy and would occasionally reappear at the center of several financially dubious schemes.

On February 25, 1929,&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, "Former Transport Buford Reported Sold," February 25, 1929, pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt; it was reported that the ''Buford'' would be scrapped in Yokohama, Japan by Hasegawa Gentaro. She sailed from Los Angeles on May 11, 1929, flying the American flag under the command of Capt. A. G. Laur to meet her final fate.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, "Old Transport To Sail On Last Voyage," May 10, 1929, pg. A-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ulster Unionist Party''' ('''UUP''') is a [[Unionist (Ireland)|unionist]] [[political party]] in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/northern_ireland/4411535.stm |work=BBC News |title=NI parties step on election trail |date=5 April 2005 |accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having gathered support in Northern Ireland during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, the party governed Northern Ireland between 1921 and 1972. It was supported by most unionist voters throughout the conflict known as [[the Troubles]], during which time it was often referred to as the '''Official Unionist Party''' ('''OUP''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/uorgan.htm|title=Abstracts of Organisations - 'U'|date=23 September 2015|work=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]]|publisher=University of Ulster|pages=Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) |nopp=Y|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/parties/pauup.shtml|title=Ulster Unionist Party|year=1997|work=Politics 97|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1905 and 1972 its MPs took the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] whip at Westminster, considered as part of the Conservative Party.

It is currently the fourth-largest party in Northern Ireland, having been overtaken in 2003 by the [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]] and [[Sinn Féin]], and in [[2017 UK general election|2017]] by the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]]. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], the party won two seats in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] and [[South Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|South Antrim]]. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 snap election]], the party lost these two seats, and made no gains.

In 2016, the UUP, the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]] and the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]] decided not to accept the seats on the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] to which they would have been entitled and to form an official opposition to the executive. This marked the first time since 1921 that a [[devolved government]] in Northern Ireland did not include the UUP. The party was led by [[Mike Nesbitt]], but on 3 March 2017 he announced his resignation following the party's poor performance at that year's [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2017|assembly election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-northern-ireland-2017-39147988|title=Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt is to resign|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2 March 2017|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== 1880s to 1921 ===
{{See also|Irish Unionist Alliance}}
The Ulster Unionist Party traces its formal existence back to the foundation of the '''Ulster Unionist Council''' in 1905. Before that, however, there had been a less formally organised [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] (IUA) since the late 19th century, usually dominated by unionists from [[Ulster]]. Modern organised unionism properly emerged after [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s introduction in 1886 of the first of three [[Irish Home Rule Bill|Home Rule Bills]] in response to demands by the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. The IUA was an alliance of Irish [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]], the latter having split from the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] over the issue of [[Irish Home Rule Movement|home rule]]. It was the merger of these two parties in 1912 that gave rise to the current name of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative and Unionist Party]], to which the UUP was formally linked (to varying degrees) until 1985.

From the beginning, the party had a strong association with the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]], a [[Protestant]] [[fraternal organisation]]. The original composition of the Ulster Unionist Council was 25% Orange delegates,&lt;ref&gt;John Harbinson (1973) The Ulster Unionist Party, 1882–1973. Belfast: Blackstaff Press {{ISBN|0-85640-007-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this was reduced through the years. Although most unionist support was based in the geographic area that became Northern Ireland, there were at one time unionist enclaves throughout southern Ireland. Unionists in [[County Cork]] and [[Dublin]] were particularly influential. The initial leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party all came from outside what would later become Northern Ireland; men such as [[Edward James Saunderson|Colonel Saunderson]], [[William St John Fremantle Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|Viscount (later the Earl of) Midleton]] and the Dubliner [[Edward Carson]], all members of the Irish Unionist Alliance. However, after the [[Irish Convention]] failed to reach an understanding on home rule and with the [[partition of Ireland]] under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]], Irish unionism in effect split. Many southern unionist politicians quickly became reconciled with the new [[Irish Free State]], sitting in its [[Seanad]] or joining its political parties. The existence of a separate Ulster Unionist Party became entrenched as the party took control of the new [[government of Northern Ireland]].

[[File:The Road To War Q81759.jpg|thumb|right|Carson inspecting the [[Ulster Volunteers|UVF]], [[F.E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|F.E.Smith]] walking behind him, pre-1914]]
The leadership of the UUP was taken by Sir Edward Carson in 1910. Throughout his 11-year leadership he fought a sustained campaign against Irish Home Rule, including being involved in the formation of the [[Ulster Volunteers]] (UVF) in 1912. In the [[Irish general election, 1918|1918 general election]], Carson switched constituencies from his former seat of [[Dublin University (UK constituency)|Dublin University]] to [[Belfast Duncairn (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast Duncairn]]. Carson strongly opposed the partition of Ireland and the end of unionism as an all-Ireland political force, so he refused the opportunity to be [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]] or even to sit in the [[Northern Ireland House of Commons]], citing a lack of connection with the place. The leadership of the UUP and, subsequently, Northern Ireland, was taken by Sir [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]].

=== The Stormont era: Part of the Conservative Party ===

==== 1920–1963 ====
Until almost the very end of its period of power in [[Northern Ireland]], the UUP was led by a combination of [[landed gentry]] ([[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough]], [[Hugh MacDowell Pollock]] and [[James Chichester-Clark]]), [[aristocracy]] ([[Terence O'Neill]]) and gentrified industrial magnates ([[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon]] and [[John Miller Andrews]] – nephew of [[William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie]]). Only its last [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland|Prime Minister]], [[Brian Faulkner]], was from a middle-class background. During this era, all but 11 of the 149 UUP Stormont MPs were members of the [[Orange Order]], as were all Prime Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sneps.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/1-Dominant-Ethnicity-demography-and-conflict_revision-Dec2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

James Craig governed Northern Ireland from its inception until his death in 1940 and is buried with his wife by the east wing of [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings]]. His successor, J. M. Andrews, was heavily criticised for appointing octogenarian veterans of Craigavon's administration to [[Andrews ministry|his cabinet]]. His government was also believed to be more interested in protecting the statue of Carson at the Stormont Estate than the citizens of Belfast during the [[Belfast blitz]]. A backbench revolt in 1943 resulted in his resignation and replacement by Sir Basil Brooke (later Viscount Brookeborough), although he was recognised as leader of the party until 1946.

Brookeborough, despite having felt that Craigavon had held on to power for too long, was Prime Minister for one year longer. During this time he was on more than one occasion called to meetings of the [[Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland]] to explain his actions, most notably following the 1947 Education Act which made the government responsible for the payment of [[National Insurance]] contributions of teachers in Catholic Church-controlled schools. [[Ian Paisley]] called for Brookeborough's resignation in 1953 when he refused to sack [[Brian Maginess]] and [[Clarence Graham]], who had given speeches supporting re-admitting Catholics to the UUP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nuTC9ZiZZf0C&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=brian+maginess+catholic+membership+uup&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dwld-4fwus&amp;sig=q1ivQcmV9ovm7hOTnBMRgFIKLNI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKh8C9mLjJAhUCew8KHVM4DAEQ6AEIKzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=brian%20maginess%20catholic%20membership%20uup&amp;f=false|title=A Tragedy of Errors|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired in 1963 and was replaced by [[Terence O'Neill]], who emerged ahead of other candidates, [[Jack Andrews]] and Faulkner.

==== 1963–1972 ====
In the 1960s, identifying with the [[civil rights movement]] of [[Martin Luther King]] and encouraged by attempts at reform under O'Neill, various organisations campaigned for civil rights, calling for changes to the system for allocating public housing and the voting system for the local government franchise, which was restricted to (disproportionately Protestant) [[Rates (tax)|rate payers]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ira/conflict/civil.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3eDHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=local+elections+northern+ireland+ratepayers+mostly+protestant&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iQ8tnR3sxW&amp;sig=acVedV0EkuE5BRRJWNwitWBENU0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAmoVChMIjPv3y5LYxwIVa-9yCh2jkwdy#v=onepage&amp;q=local%20elections%20northern%20ireland%20ratepayers%20mostly%20protestant&amp;f=false|title=Human Rights as War by Other Means|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6hFEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=local+elections+northern+ireland+ratepayers+mostly+protestant&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=24iaVcqTg7&amp;sig=H8GzulOAx4FCb4yN2CLispufVho&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBGoVChMIjPv3y5LYxwIVa-9yCh2jkwdy#v=onepage&amp;q=local%20elections%20northern%20ireland%20ratepayers%20mostly%20protestant&amp;f=false|title=Northern Ireland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/recent/troubles/the_troubles_article_01.shtml|title=BBC - History - The Troubles, 1963 to 1985|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neill had pushed through some reforms but in the process the Ulster Unionists became strongly divided. At the [[Northern Ireland general election, 1969|1969 Stormont General Election]] UUP candidates stood on both pro- and anti-O'Neill platforms. Several independent pro-O'Neill unionists challenging his critics, while the [[Protestant Unionist Party]] of Ian Paisley mounted a hard-line challenge. The result proved inconclusive for O'Neill, who resigned a short time later. His resignation was probably caused by a speech of [[James Chichester-Clark]] who stated that he disagreed with the timing, but not the principle, of universal suffrage at local elections.

Chichester-Clark won the [[Ulster Unionist Party leadership election, 1969|leadership election to replace O'Neill]] and swiftly moved to implement many of O'Neill's reforms. Civil disorder continued to mount, culminating in August 1969 when Catholic [[Bogside]] residents clashed with the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] in [[Derry]] because of an [[Apprentice Boys of Derry]] march, sparking days of riots. Early in 1971, Chichester-Clark flew to London to request further military aid following the [[1971 Scottish soldiers' killings]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} When this was all but refused, he resigned to be [[Ulster Unionist Party leadership election, 1971|replaced by Brian Faulkner]].

Faulkner's government struggled though 1971 and into 1972. After [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]], the British Government threatened to remove control of the security forces from the devolved government. Faulkner reacted by resigning with his entire cabinet, and the British Government suspended, and eventually abolished, the [[Northern Ireland Parliament]], replacing it with [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|Direct Rule]].

The liberal unionist group, the [[New Ulster Movement]], which had advocated the policies of Terence O'Neill, left and formed the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] in April 1970, while the emergence of Ian Paisley's [[Protestant Unionist Party]] continued to draw off some working-class and more [[Ulster loyalist]] support.

=== 1972–1995 ===
[[File:Troubled Images Exhibition, Belfast, August 2010 (03).JPG|thumb|right|Ulster Unionist Party, 1974. Troubled Images Exhibition, Linen Hall Library, Belfast, August 2010]]
In June 1973 the UUP won a majority of seats in the new [[Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973|Northern Ireland Assembly]], but the party was divided on policy. The [[Sunningdale Agreement]], which led to the formation of a power-sharing Executive under Ulster Unionist leader [[Brian Faulkner]], ruptured the party. In the 1973 elections to the Executive the party found itself divided, a division that did not formally end until January 1974 with the triumph of the anti-Sunningdale faction. Faulkner was then overthrown, and he set up the [[Unionist Party of Northern Ireland]] (UPNI). The Ulster Unionists were then led by [[Harry West]] from 1974 until 1979. In the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]], the party participated in the [[United Ulster Unionist Coalition]] (UUUC) with [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party|Vanguard]] and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]], successor to the Protestant Unionist Party. The result was that the UUUC won 11 out of 12 parliamentary seats in Northern Ireland on a fiercely anti-Sunningdale platform, although they barely won 50% of the overall popular vote. This result was a fatal blow for the Executive, which soon collapsed.

Up until 1972 the UUP sat with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]], traditionally taking the Conservative parliamentary [[Whip_(politics)|whip]]. To all intents and purposes the party functioned as the Northern Ireland branch of the Conservative Party. In 1972, in protest over the prorogation of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], the Westminster Ulster Unionist MPs withdrew from the alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Keohane (2000), ''Security in British Politics 1945-99'', p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Bell and Anthony Seldon, ''The Heath Government 1970-74: A Reappraisal''&lt;/ref&gt; The party remained affiliated to the [[National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations]], but in 1985, withdrew from it as well, in protest over the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]]. Subsequently, the Conservative Party has [[NI Conservatives|organised separately]] in Northern Ireland, with little electoral success.

Under West's leadership, the party recruited [[Enoch Powell]], who became Ulster Unionist MP for [[South Down (UK Parliament constituency)|South Down]] in [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974]] after defecting from the Conservatives. Powell advocated a policy of 'integration', whereby Northern Ireland would be administered as an integral part of the United Kingdom. This policy divided both the Ulster Unionists and the wider unionist movement, as Powell's ideas conflicted with those supporting a restoration of devolved government to Northern Ireland. The party also made gains upon the break-up of the [[Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party|Vanguard Party]] and its merger back into the Ulster Unionists. The separate [[United Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUUP) emerged from the remains of Vanguard but folded in the early 1980s, as did the UPNI. In both cases the main beneficiaries of this were the Ulster Unionists, now under the leadership of [[James Molyneaux]] (1979–95).

=== Trimble leadership ===
[[David Trimble]] led the party between 1995 and 2005. His support for the [[Belfast Agreement]] caused a rupture within the party into pro-agreement and anti-agreement factions. Trimble served as [[First Minister of Northern Ireland]] in the power-sharing administration created under the [[Belfast Agreement]].

Unusually for a unionist party, the UUP had a Roman Catholic [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLA) (the [[Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly]]), [[John Gorman (NI)|Sir John Gorman]] until the 2003 election. In March 2005, the Orange Order voted to end its official links with the UUP, while still maintaining the same unofficial links as other interest groups.  Trimble faced down Orange Order critics who tried to suspend him for his attendance at a Catholic funeral for a young boy killed by the [[Real Irish Republican Army|Real IRA]] in the [[Omagh bombing]]. In a sign of unity, Trimble and [[President of Ireland]] [[Mary McAleese]] walked into the church together.

{{wikinews|UUP leader loses seat in 2005 UK General Election}}
In the 2001 general election, the Ulster Unionists lost a number of seats belonging to UUP stalwarts; for example, [[John Taylor, Baron Kilclooney|John Taylor]], the former deputy leader of the party, lost his seat of [[Strangford]] to [[Iris Robinson]].

The party's misfortunes continued at the 2005 election. The party held six seats at Westminster immediately before the 2005 general election, down from seven after the previous general election following the defection of [[Jeffrey Donaldson]] in 2004. The election resulted in the loss of five of their six seats. The only seat won by an Ulster Unionist was North Down, by [[Sylvia Hermon]], who had won the seat in the 2001 general election from Robert McCartney of [[UKUP|United Kingdom Unionist Party]]. Only the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] lost more seats in 2005. David Trimble himself lost his seat in [[Upper Bann (UK Parliament constituency)|Upper Bann]] and resigned as party leader soon after. The ensuing [[Ulster Unionist Party leadership election, 2005|leadership election]] was won by [[Reg Empey]].

===Empey leadership===
In May 2006 UUP leader [[Reg Empey]] attempted to create a new assembly group that would have included [[Progressive Unionist Party]] (PUP) leader [[David Ervine]]. The PUP is the political wing of the illegal [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4244082.stm | work=BBC News | title=What is the UVF? | date=14 September 2005 | accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/politicsobituaries/story/0,,1985671,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=David Ervine | first=Henry | last=McDonald | date=8 January 2007 | accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/world/para/uvf.htm Federation of American Scientists] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705094319/https://fas.org/irp/world/para/uvf.htm |date=5 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/ulster/article301681.ece|title= Feuding loyalists bring the fear back to Belfast | work=The Independent | first=David | last=McKittrick | date=26 July 2005 | accessdate=9 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=124|title= MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many in the UUP, including the last remaining MP, [[Sylvia Hermon]], were opposed to the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4772777.stm |work=BBC News |title=Row as Ervine joins UUP grouping |date=15 May 2006 |accessdate=9 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308074312/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4772777.stm |archivedate=8 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4990810.stm | work=BBC News | title=MP 'distressed' over Ervine move | date=17 May 2006 | accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The link was in the form of a new group called the 'Ulster Unionist Party Assembly Group' whose membership was the 24 UUP MLAs and Ervine. Empey justified the link by stating that under the [[d'Hondt method]] for allocating ministers in the Assembly, the new group would take a seat in the Executive from Sinn Féin.

Following a request for a ruling from the DUP's [[Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)|Peter Robinson]], the Speaker ruled that the UUPAG was not a political party within the meaning of the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/5335004.stm | work=BBC News | title=UUP-PUP link 'against the rules' | date=11 September 2006 | accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party did poorly in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2007|2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election]]. The party retained 18 of its seats within the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6435755.stm DUP top in NI assembly election], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 12 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Empey was the only leader of one of the four main parties not to be re-elected on first preference votes alone in the Assembly elections of March 2007.

In July 2008, the UUP and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] announced that a joint working group had been established to examine closer ties. On 26 February 2009, the Ulster Unionist Executive and area council of Northern Ireland Conservatives agreed to field joint candidates in future elections to the House of Commons and European Parliament under the name "[[Ulster Conservatives and Unionists|Ulster Conservatives and Unionists – New Force]]". The agreement meant that Ulster Unionist MPs could have sat in a Conservative Government, renewing the relationship that had broken down in 1974 over the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] and in 1985 over the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7913967.stm | work=BBC News | title=Lady Hermon under 'no pressure' | date=27 February 2009 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Profile: Jim Nicholson | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 12 May 2009| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/8039722.stm | accessdate = 30 May 2009 | first=Mark | last=Devenport}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/2450913/David-Cameron-launches-biggest-Conservative-shake-up-for-decades.html David Cameron launches biggest Conservative shake-up for decades] ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London), 23 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The UUP's sole remaining MP at the time, Sylvia Hermon, opposed the agreement, stating she would not be willing to stand under the UCUNF banner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/hermon-why-she-rejected-tory-deal-14300527.html Hermon: why she rejected Tory deal] ''Belfast Telegraph'', 14 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, Hermon confirmed that she would not be seeking a nomination as a Conservative/UUP candidate for the forthcoming general election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/8529052.stm UUP MP Lady Sylvia Hermon rejects UCUNF candidacy] BBC News, 23 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March 2010, she formally resigned from the party and announced that she would be standing as an independent candidate at the general election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/8586845.stm MP Lady Sylvia Hermon quits Ulster Unionists] BBC News, 25 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the UUP were left without representation in the House of Commons for the first time since the party's creation.

At the [[United Kingdom General Election, 2010|2010 General Election]], UCUNF won no seats in Northern Ireland (while Hermon won hers as an independent). The Ulster Conservatives and Unionists – New Force label was not used again. Following the election, [[Sir Reg Empey]] resigned as leader. He was replaced by [[Tom Elliott (politician)|Tom Elliott]] as party leader in the subsequent [[Ulster Unionist Party leadership election, 2010|leadership election]]. During the leadership election, it emerged that a quarter of the UUP membership came from [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]], an area with about 6% of Northern Ireland's population, the constituency of Tom Elliott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Legal threat to the UUP leadership race ebbs |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/legal-threat-to-the-uup-leadership-race-ebbs-28559410.html |accessdate=16 January 2015 |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dublin-based political magazine, ''[[The Phoenix (magazine)|the Phoenix]]'', described Elliott as a "blast from the past" and said that his election signified "a significant shift to the right" by the UUP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thephoenix.ie/phoenix/subscriber/library/volume-28/issue-25/contents.pdf|title=Phoenix Magazine  - Subscriber - Login|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his election, three 2010 general election candidates resigned: Harry Hamilton, Paula Bradshaw and [[Trevor Ringland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/Troubled-backdrop-to-UUP-conference.6649457.jp|title=Troubled backdrop to UUP conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradshaw and Hamilton subsequently joined the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12189278 | work=BBC News | title=Queen tribute singer Harry Hamilton with Alliance Party | date=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 2011===
The party further declined in the 2011 Assembly elections (standing again as the UUP). It lost two seats and won fewer votes than the nationalist [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) (although it won more seats than the SDLP) and two of its candidates, Bill Manwaring and Lesley Macaulay, subsequently joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. In addition, east of the Bann, it lost seats to the Alliance Party. It was also overtaken by Alliance on Belfast City Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u.tv/News/Magnificent-council-result-for-Alliance/505314e4-dc53-4cb6-8f8f-03d1aad24482|title='Magnificent' council result for Alliance|work=u.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, the Conservative Party chairman, [[Andrew Feldman, Baron Feldman of Elstree|Lord Feldman]], wrote to Elliott to propose a formal and permanent merger of the two parties. The proposal, which had the backing of [[David Cameron]], would have seen the UUP form the backbone of a new party called the Northern Ireland Conservative and Unionist Party (NICUP). Elliott rejected the merger and called the proposed dissolution of the UUP "unacceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15676151 | work=BBC News | title=Conservatives want UUP to disband and form new Tory-led party | date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Elliott was criticised for comments he made in his victory speech where he described elements of [[Sinn Féin]] as "scum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0507/breaking1.html | work=The Irish Times | title=DUP and Sinn Féin top polls in NI Assembly elections | date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elliott resigned in March 2012 saying some people had not given him a 'fair opportunity' to develop and progress many party initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Purdy | first = Martina | title = UUP leader Tom Elliott quitting as party leader | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 9 March 2012 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-17306313 | access-date = 11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mike Nesbitt]] was elected leader on 31 March 2012, beating the only other candidate, [[John McCallister]], by 536 votes to 129.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Mike Nesbitt is new Ulster Unionist leader | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 31 March 2012 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-17572015 | access-date = 11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservatives and the UUP went their separate ways again,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18430849 | work=BBC News | title=Can rebranded Northern Ireland Conservatives deliver? | date=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Northern Ireland Conservatives]] relaunching as a separate party on 14 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.niconservatives.com/news/ni-conservatives-launch-fresh-centre-right-party-belfast | work=NI Conservatives | location=Belfast | title=NI Conservatives launch as fresh, centre-right party, in Belfast | first=Owen | last=Polley | date=14 June 2012 | accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although their MEP seat, held by Jim Nicholson, had its vote percentage decreased slightly in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 European election]], the party managed to make gains in the local elections of that same day. They increased their share by 0.9%, making it the only party to increase its vote share, and gaining 15 seats as a result.

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], the UUP returned to Westminster, gaining the South Antrim seat from the DUP and Fermanagh &amp; South Tyrone (where they had an electoral pact with the DUP not standing) from Sinn Féin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2015/results/northern_ireland | work=BBC News | title=Election 2015 results: Northern Ireland | date=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]] the UUP lost both of its Commons seats, losing South Antrim to the DUP and Fermanagh &amp; South Tyrone to Sinn Féin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2017/results/northern_ireland | work=BBC News | title=Election 2017 results: Northern Ireland | date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party, which saw a significant decrease in its vote share, failed to take any other seats. As such the UUP currently has no representation in the House of Commons.

==Structure==
The UUP is still organised around the Ulster Unionist Council, which was from 1905 until 2004 the only legal representation of the party. Following the adoption of a new Constitution in 2004, the UUP has been an entity in its own right, however the UUC still exists as the supreme decision making body of the Party.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In autumn 2007 the delegates system was done away with, and today all UUP members are members of the Ulster Unionist Council, with entitlements to vote for the Leader, party officers and on major policy decisions.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Each constituency in Northern Ireland forms the boundary of a UUP constituency association, which is made up of branches formed along local boundaries (usually district electoral areas). There are also four 'representative bodies', the [[Ulster Women's Unionist Council]], the [[Ulster Young Unionist Council]], the Westminster Unionist Association (the party's Great Britain branch) and the [[Ulster Unionist Councillors Association]]. Each constituency association and representative body elects a number of delegates to the Executive Committee, which governs many areas of party administration such as membership and candidate selection.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The UUP maintained a formal connection with the Orange Order from its foundation until 2005, and with the [[Apprentice Boys of Derry]] until 1975.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} While the party was considering structural reforms, including the connection with the Order, it was the Order itself that severed the connection in 2004. The connection with the Apprentice Boys was cut in a 1975 review of the party's structure as they had not taken up their delegates for several years beforehand.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Youth wing===
The UUP's youth wing is the [[Young Unionists]], first formed in 2004 as a rebrand of the Ulster Young Unionist Council, which formed in 1946. Many of its members have stayed with the party, such as the present leader of the UUP. Others have left to start other Unionist parties. Having disbanded twice, in 1974 and 2004, the Council was re-constituted by young activists in March 2004. This resulted in the Young Unionists (YU) becoming a representative body of the UUP and subject to its revamp of their Constitution.

[[File:Velleda.jpg|thumb|''Velleda'', as imagined in a 19th-century painting by Charles Voillemot.]]
'''Veleda''' was a [[priest]]ess and [[prophet]] of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] of the [[Bructeri]] who achieved some prominence during the [[Batavian rebellion]] of AD&amp;nbsp;69&amp;ndash;70, headed by the Romanized [[Batavii|Batavian]] chieftain [[Gaius Julius Civilis]], when she correctly predicted the initial successes of the rebels against Roman legions.

==Life==
The name may be Celtic and generic title for a prophetess (from [[Proto-Celtic]] ''*welet-'' "seer", a derivative of the root ''*wel-'' "to see").&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre, Xavier, Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise, 2nd ed., Errance, 2003, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koch, John (ed.), Celtic Culture, ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 1728&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient [[Germanic peoples]] discerned a divinity of prophecy in women and regarded prophetesses as true and living [[goddess]]es. In the latter half of the 1st century AD Veleda was regarded as a [[deity]] by most of the tribes in [[central Germany (geography)|central Germany]] and enjoyed wide influence.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Thurston Peck, ''Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities'', 2nd edition, p. 1640. New York: Cooper Square Publishers, Inc., 1965. Originally published in this form in 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; She lived in a tower near the [[Lippe River]], a tributary of the [[Rhine]].&lt;ref name="Frazer"&gt;Sir James George Frazer, ''The Golden Bough. A Study in Magic and Religion'', One-volume abridged edition, p. 97. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1947. Originally published in this form in 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants of the Roman settlement of Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (now [[Cologne]]) accepted her arbitration in a conflict with the [[Tencteri]], an unfederated tribe of Germany (i.e., one outside the boundary of the [[Roman Empire]]). In her role as arbitrator, the envoys were not admitted to her presence; an interpreter conveyed their messages to her and reported her pronouncements.&lt;ref name="Frazer"/&gt;

The Batavian leader Civilis originally raised his force as an ally of [[Vespasian]] during the Roman power struggle in AD 69, but when he saw the weakened condition of the legions in Romanized Germany he openly revolted. It is not clear whether Veleda merely prophesied the rebellion or actively incited it; given the Germans' adoration of her as a goddess, remote in her tower, the distinction may not have been clear at the time. Early in AD 70 the revolt was joined by Julius Classicus and Julius Tutor, leaders of the Treviri who like Civilis were Roman citizens. The Roman garrison at Novaesium (now [[Neuss]]) surrendered without a fight, as did the one at Castra Vetera (near modern [[Xanten]] in [[Lower Rhine region|Niederrhein]], Germany).&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;Michael Grant, ''The Army of the Caesars'', pp. 207-208. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1974. {{ISBN|0-684-13821-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commander of the Roman garrison, Munius Lupercus, was sent to Veleda, though he was killed en route, evidently in an ambush. Later, when the praetorian trireme was captured, it was rowed upriver on the Lippe as a gift to Veleda.&lt;ref name="Lendering"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.livius.org/va-vh/veleda/veleda.html | title = Veleda | accessdate = December 2, 2006 | last = Lendering | first = Jona | authorlink = Jona Lendering | work = Livius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong show of force by nine Roman legions under [[Mucianus|Gaius Licinius Mucianus]] caused the rebellion to collapse. Civilis was cornered on his home island of [[Batavia (region)|Batavia]] on the lower Rhine by a force commanded by [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]]; his fate is unknown, but in general Cerialis treated the rebels with surprising lenience, so as to reconcile them to Roman rule and military service.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; In Veleda's case, she was left at liberty for several years.

In AD 77 the Romans either captured her, perhaps as a hostage, or offered her asylum. According to [[Statius]], her captor was Rutilius Gallicus.&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''[[Silvae]]'' 1.4, line 90; J.G.W. Henderson, ''A Roman Life: Rutilius Gallicus On Paper and In Stone''. Exeter, UK: University of Exeter Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; A Greek epigram has been found at [[Ardea (RM)|Ardea]], a few kilometres south of [[Rome]], that satirizes her prophetic powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Année Épigraphique'' 1953, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Veleda may have acted in the interest of Rome by negotiating the acceptance of a pro-Roman king by the Bructeri in AD 83 or 84.&lt;ref name="Lendering"/&gt; She was evidently long since deceased by the time [[Tacitus]] wrote his ''Germania'' in AD 98.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Germany'', 8.2. Translation with Commentary by Herbert W. Benario. Warminster, UK: Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd., 1999. {{ISBN|0-85668-716-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In her 1795 novel ''Velleda, ein Zauberroman'' (Velleda, a Magic Novel), [[Benedikte Naubert]] conflated the lives of two contemporaries, [[Boudica]] and Veleda, whom she romanticized as Boadicea and Velleda. In Naubert's work, Velleda is portrayed as a sorceress who offers Boadicea's daughters access to immortality in the magical world of Germanic goddesses, while Boadicea draws her daughters back to the real world. A large extract from Naubert's novel appeared in Shawn C. Jarvis and Jeannine Blackwell's ''The Queen's Mirror'', as did Amalie von Helwig's 1814 story "Die Symbole" (The Symbols), in which she was called Welleda.&lt;ref&gt;Shawn C. Jarvis and Jeannine Blackwell (eds. and trans.), ''The Queen's Mirror. Fairy Tales by German Women, 1780–1900'', pp. 33–74, 117–125. Lincoln, Neb.: University of Nebraska Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8032-6181-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forms "Velleda" and "Welleda" appear to be attempts to render the name in modern German (much as [[Richard Wagner]] rendered [[Odin]] or [[Wōden]] as Wotan in his ''Ring'' cycle).

Other 19th-century works incorporating Veleda/Velleda/Welleda included [[Friedrich de la Motte-Fouqué]]'s 1818 novel, ''Welleda und Gemma''; [[Eduard Sobolewski]]'s 1835 opera ''Velleda''; E.H. Maindron's 1843–44 marble sculpture ''Velleda'', and Franz Sigret's drawing ''Veleda, Prophetess of the Bructeri''.

More recently, Veleda's story was fictionalized by [[Poul Anderson]] in ''Star of the Sea'' (1991) and by [[Lindsey Davis]] in ''[[The Iron Hand of Mars]]'' (1992) and ''[[Saturnalia (Davis novel)|Saturnalia]]'' (2007). Veleda is also referenced as a prophetess turned saint/goddess in ''The Veil of Years'' (2001) by L. Warren Douglas.  She is also a character in ''The Dragon Lord'' (1979), by [[David Drake]].

On November 5, 1872, [[Paul-Pierre Henry|Paul Henry]] of Paris discovered an asteroid that was named [[126 Velleda]] in honor of Veleda.

* [[Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)|Russian Foreign Ministry]]: The text of the document, which was obviously drawn up with Washington's encouragement directly after the United States refused to observe the Russian-US agreements on the Syrian settlement, flagrantly misrepresented the actual state of affairs and had a politically-charged and unbalanced character. The French-proposed document indiscriminately laid the blame for the escalation of tensions in the Syrian Arab Republic solely on the country's authorities and plainly attempted, through a ban on military flights over the city of Aleppo, to afford protection to Jabhat al-Nusra terrorists and the militants that have merged with it, despite the UN member states' obligation to fight the terrorist threat with all available means. The draft resolution completely obscured the fact that the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo was provoked deliberately, when in August and September the militants refused to provide access to humanitarian convoys, threatening to open fire on them. At the same time, the document ignored the need to promptly initiate an intra-Syrian political process, which is being sabotaged by the same Syrian opposition members who are supported and covered by the West in every possible way.&lt;ref name="No6"&gt;{{cite web

* Reaffirms its strong condemnation of the widespread violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the Syrian authorities and pro-government militias, as well as the human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law by non-State armed groups.

* [[Wang Min (diplomat)|Wang Min]] (Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador of China to the UN):&lt;br /&gt;Any action seeking referral to the International Criminal Court should be based on the premise of respect for the judicial sovereignty of States and the principle of complementarity. Historically, China had always held reservations about referring situations to the Court. Although current efforts to seek a political solution were experiencing difficulties, the international community must remain patient.&lt;ref name="No4"&gt;{{cite web

* [[Vitaly Churkin]] (Permanent Representative of Russia to the UN):&lt;br/&gt; although the motivations of delegations supporting the draft resolution and their emotions are understandable, it was difficult to understand France's motivation since that delegation had been fully aware of the end result of tabling the text draft. "P5" unity had been demonstrated through concrete positive results like resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118|2118]] on the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, or resolution [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2139|2139]] on humanitarian issues.

* Commend the United Nation's Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS) personnel for their continued efforts in a dangerous and volatile environment.
* Cease troop movements towards population centres, and all use of heavy weapons in such centres.
* Decide that, if the Syrian authorities have not fully complied with paragraph above within ten days, then it shall impose immediately measures under Article 41 of the UN Charter (complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations&lt;ref name="ArticleVII" /&gt;).

* [[Li Baodong]] (Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of China to the UN):&lt;br/&gt;The draft resolution, however, was counter-productive, as it had uneven content that put pressure on only one party, which would only derail the issue from the track of political settlement and undermine regional peace and stability.&lt;ref name="No3"&gt;{{cite web

* [[Vitaly Churkin]] (Permanent Representative of Russia to the UN):&lt;br/&gt; Instead of levelling insinuations against the Russian Federation, which throughout the conflict had provided key support for the Annan mission, those members had today made "unacceptable statements".  They could have done something to promote dialogue with their Syrian counterparts, rather than fan the flames of conflict, including of Syrian terrorist groups, as they furthered their own "geopolitical designs".&lt;ref name="No3" /&gt;

* [[Vitaly Churkin]] (Permanent Representative of Russia to the UN):&lt;br/&gt; The draft resolution voted down today sought to send an "unbalanced" message to Syria, and it did not accurately reflect the situation there.

* Calls upon all States to exercise vigilance and restraint over the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer to Syria of arms and related materiel of all types, as well as technical training, financial resources or services, advice, or other services or assistance related to such arms and related material.
* Expresses its intention to review Syria's implementation of this resolution within 30 days and to consider its options, including measures under Article 41 of the [[United Nations Charter]] (complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations&lt;ref name="ArticleVII"&gt;{{cite web

'''Water efficiency''' is reducing [[water wastage]] by measuring the amount of water required for a particular purpose and the amount of water used or delivered.&lt;ref name="Vickers, Amy 2002"&gt;Vickers, Amy. “Water Use and Conservation.” Amherst, MA Waterplow Press. June 2002. 434&lt;/ref&gt; Water efficiency differs from [[water conservation]] in that it focuses on reducing waste, not restricting use.&lt;ref name="Waterwise"&gt;[http://www.waterwise.org.uk/pages/save-water.html] Waterwise&lt;/ref&gt; Solutions for water efficiency focus not only on reducing the amount of [[potable water]] used, but also on reducing the use of non-potable water where appropriate (i.e. [[flushing toilet]], [[irrigation|watering landscape]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;https://sftool.gov/learn/about/45/water-efficiency&lt;/ref&gt; It also emphasises the influence consumers can have in water efficiency by making small behavioural changes to reduce water wastage and by choosing more water efficient products.

Examples of water efficient steps includes fixing leaking taps, taking showers rather than baths, installing displacements devices inside toilet cisterns, and using dishwashers and washing machines with full loads. These are things that fall under the definition of water efficiency, as their purpose is to obtain the desired result or level of service with the least necessary water.&lt;ref name="Vickers, Amy 2002" /&gt;

==Importance==
According to the Second [[UN World Water Development Report]], if present levels of consumption continue, two-thirds of the global population will live in areas of water stress by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/wwdr2/table_contents.shtml The 2nd UN World Water Development Report: ‘Water, a shared responsibility’]&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing human demand for water coupled with the effects of climate change mean that the future of our water supply is not secure. As of now, 2.6 billion people do not have safe drinking water. Added to this, are the changes in climate, population growth and lifestyles. The changes in human lifestyle and activities require more water per capita. This tightens the competition for water amongst agricultural, industrial, and human consumption.&lt;ref name="worldwatercouncil.org"&gt;[http://worldwatercouncil.org/index.php?id=25&amp;L=0 WWC]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
In most countries, people have recognized this growing [[water scarcity]] problem. Water efficiency, while not yet a major priority in the agendas of governments, has been a growing concern. Global organizations like the World Water Council,&lt;ref name="worldwatercouncil.org" /&gt; the International Water Management Institute,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/ IWMI] IWMI&lt;/ref&gt; and UNESCO&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/water/ UNESCO Water]&lt;/ref&gt; have been promoting water efficiency alongside water conservation.

The [[Alliance for Water Efficiency]], [http://www.waterwise.org.uk Waterwise], the [http://www.cuwcc.org California Urban Water Conservation Council], and [http://www.smartwatermark.org Smart WaterMark] in Australia, and the [http://www.waterbucket.ca WaterBucket] in Canada are some non-governmental organizations that promote or support water efficiency at national and regional levels.

Governmental organisations such as [[Environment Canada]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), the [[Environment Agency]] in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Department of the Environment and Water Resources]] in [[Australia]], among others, have recognized and created policies and strategies to raise water efficiency awareness. US EPA created its [[WaterSense]] program to encourage water efficiency in the United States through the use of a special label on consumer products.

The People's Republic of China has put forward a 5-year plan (2010-2015) at a cost of Y500 billion ($78.1 billion) to Y600 billion ($93.7 billion) to upgrade most of the 4,000 water plants in China. The government hopes these steps will help to better conserve water and meet demands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Water&amp;rft.jtitle=The+China+Business+Review&amp;rft.au=Anonymous&amp;rft.date=2011-10-01&amp;rft.issn=0163-7169&amp;rft.volume=38&amp;rft.issue=4&amp;rft.spage=6&amp;rft.externalDBID=CHB&amp;rft.externalDocID=2505915221 Chinese Business Review: Water]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian state of [[Haryana]], has implemented State Rural Water Policy 2012; under this policy individual household metered connections would be provided to 50% of the rural population by 2017, to stop water wastage in villages.&lt;ref&gt;Water Preservation in Rural India http://iharnews.com/index.php/government/231-haryana-rural-water-policy-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A part of the industry sector has also recognised the benefits of water efficiency. Such journals as the Water Efficiency Journal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterefficiency.net/we.html Water Efficiency Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; from the US, Water Efficient Solutions Journal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterefficientsolutions.net Water Efficient Solutions Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; and Water Energy and Environment&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy-online.net/ Water Energy and Environment]&lt;/ref&gt; Magazine from the UK, all mainly directed towards the industrial and professional sectors, attest to the growing consciousness of the need to develop more water efficient solutions.

==Water efficient solutions==

{{further|Sustainable living#Water}}

===Residential===
Here are some simple ways to be more water efficient at home
* Turning off the [[Tap (valve)|tap]] while [[brushing teeth]] - a running tap can waste over six liters per minute.
* Putting a displacement device into the toilet cistern.
* Installing [[Water aeration|aerator]]s or flow [[reducer]] (NFR) of less flow on taps/faucet and reducing [[water wastage]].
* Installing water efficient showers in bathrooms for [[bathing]].
* Fixing [[Valve leakage|dripping taps]]. A dripping tap wastes thousands of litres of water a year.
* Using a full load in the [[dishwasher]] and [[washing machine]]. A person should be sure to buy a water efficient model when buying a new machine.
* Having a short shower instead of a bath.
* Washing fruits and vegetables in a bowl rather than under a running tap.
* Using the leftover water to feed [[houseplant]]s.
* Using a watering can or a [[hosepipe]] with a trigger nozzle instead of a sprinkler.
* Using a bucket and sponge when washing the car rather than a running hosepipe.
* Using little amounts of water at every time
* Washing clothing or linens in washing machines rather than washing by hand

Consumers can also voluntarily or with utility or government incentives or mandates purchase water-efficient appliances, such as [[low-flush toilet]]s and [[front-loading washer]]s.  [[Greywater]] can be recycled for toilet flushing or garden use.

===Manufacturing===
According to Savewater!, these are solutions useful to manufacturers:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savewater.com.au/ Savewater!]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identifying and eliminating wastage (such as leaks) and inefficient processes (such as continual spray devices on stop-start production lines). This may be the most low cost area for water savings, as it involves minimal capital outlay. Savings can be made through implementing procedural changes, such as cleaning plant areas with brooms rather than water.
* Changing processes and plant machinery. A retrofit of key plant equipment may increase efficiency. Alternatively, upgrades to more efficient models can be factored into planned maintenance and replacement schedules.
* [[Wastewater#Reuse|Reusing wastewater]]. As well as saving on mains water, this option may improve the reliability of supply, whilst reducing trade waste charges and associated environmental risks.

====Waterless products====
* Using [[waterless car wash]] products to wash cars, boats, motorcycles and bicycles.  This could save up to 150 gallons of water per wash.

===Utilities===
According to US EPA, here are some ideas for communities and utilities:&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, D.C. [http://www.epa.gov/watersense/pubs/community.htm "Using Water Efficiently: Ideas for Communities."] March 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Implementing a water-loss management program (e.g. locate and repair leaks).
* Utilities should strive for universal metering.
* Ensuring that fire hydrants are tamper proof.
* Equipment changes - Setting a good example by using water efficient equipment.
* Installing faucet aerators and low flow shower heads in municipal buildings.
* Replace worn out plumbing fixtures, appliances and equipment with water-saving models.
* Minimizing the water used in space cooling equipment in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. Shut off cooling units when not needed.

Utilities can also modify their billing software to track customers who have taken advantage of various utility sponsored water conservation initiatives (toilet rebates, irrigation rebates, etc.) to see which initiatives provide the greatest water savings for the least cost.

==Water policies and impact assessments==
[[Environmental policy|Environmental policies]] and the difference usages of models that are generated by these enforcements can have significant impacts on the society. Hence, improving policies regarding [[environmental justice]] issues often require local government's decision making, [[public awareness]], and significant amount of scientific tools. Furthermore, it is important to understand that positively impacting policy decisions require more than good intentions, and they necessitate analysis of risk-related information along with consideration of economic issues, ethical and moral principles, legal precedents, political realities, [[cultural belief]]s, [[societal values]], and bureaucratic impediments.&lt;ref name= ref1&gt;Sexton, Ken &amp; Linder, Stephen H. (2010). The Role of Cumulative risk Assessment in Decisions about Environmental Justice. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7, 4037-4049&lt;/ref&gt; Also, ensuring that the rights of people regardless of their age, race, and backgrounds are being protected should not be neglected according to "The Role of Cumulative risk Assessment in Decisions about Environmental Justice." Also, the article suggests that if a policy protects the natural environment but negatively affects those who in the reach of the enforcement of the policy, that policy is subjected to revaluation.&lt;ref name= ref1 /&gt; Researchers suggests racial and socioeconomic disparities in exposure to [[environmental hazard]]s describing the [[demographic]] composition of areas and their proximity to hazardous sites.&lt;ref name= ref2&gt;House, J., Lantz, Paula M., Mero, R., Mohai, P., &amp; Morenoff, J. (2009). Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Residential Proximity to Polluting Industrial Facilities: Evidence from the Americans' Changing Lives Study. American Journal of Public Health | Supplement 3, 2009, Vol 99, No. S3&lt;/ref&gt; Then, any improvements of a social policy and models that are generated by these improvements should reflect the policy-makers' and researchers' environmental justice beliefs. Therefore, researches and social changes should examine the promises and pitfalls associated with the environmental justice struggles, explore implications of proposed solutions, and recognize the fact that tools necessary to sufficiently carry preceding requirements are yet underdeveloped.&lt;ref name= ref3&gt;Annu. Rev. Environ. Resourc. 2009.34:405-430. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org by University of California - Berkeley on 12/11/11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water policies and impact assessments with different cases==

=== Cases ===

====A) Reef Plan (Australia)====
The Reef Plan started as an attempt to come up with a new ways to create models that integrate environmental, economical, and social consequences.&lt;ref name= reef&gt;Smajgl, A., Morris, S., &amp; Heckbert, S. (2008). Water policy impact assessment - combining modelling techniques in the [[great barrier reef]] region. Water Policy, 11(2), 191-202.&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-existing Australian water policies were often criticizes previous models for focusing too much on investment prioritization and economic dimensions when it came to policy impact assessment. However, the policy makers and researchers in Australia now suggest that "sustainability focused policy requires multi-dimensional indicators" that combine different disciplines.&lt;ref name= reef /&gt; The Reef Plan allows the policy makers to identify issues relating to Reef water quality and implement management strategies and actions to conserve and rehabilitate areas such as riparian
zones and wetlands.&lt;ref name= reefsupport&gt;Australian Government.(2003). Reef Plan: For catchments adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Reef Plan, Nine strategies were implemented in the [[Great Barrier Reef]] region. They include self-management approaches, education and extension, economic incentives, planning for natural resources management and land use, regulatory frameworks, research and information sharing, partnership, priorities and targets, and monitoring and evaluation.&lt;ref name= reef /&gt; And such improvements invoked benefits such as:
# more comprehensive picture of the policy impacts. New models projected possible outcomes of different simulation of the proposed policies under various circumstances. In addition, they provided the optimal decisions to be made regarding each outcome through the usage of what is known as computable general equilibrium (CGE) which “integrate dynamics on a catchment scale”&lt;ref name= reef /&gt;&lt;ref name= reefsupport /&gt;
# helping the aggregation of both economics aspects of water and non-monetary elements of water usage.&lt;ref name= reef /&gt;&lt;ref name= reefsupport /&gt;
# acknowledging the fact that farm production should depend on the global dynamics&lt;ref name= reef /&gt;&lt;ref name= reefsupport /&gt;

====B) Conserved Water Statutes(United States)====
Conserved Water Statutes are state policies that were enacted by [[California]], [[Montana]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Oregon]] to conserve water and allocated water resources to meet the needs of increasing demand for water in the dry lands where [[irrigation]] is or was occurring. Conserved Water Statutes helps the states to dismiss the disincentives to conserve water and can do so without damaging pre-existing water rights.&lt;ref name= ref4&gt;Behnampour, L. C. (2011). REFORMING A WESTERN INSTITUTION: HOW EXPANDING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF WATER RIGHTS COULD LESSEN OUR WATER WOES. Environmental Law (Portland), 41(1), 201-232.&lt;/ref&gt; Because any extra amount of water after applying water to a beneficiaries of the pre-existing water policies does not belong to the appropriators, such a condition creates an incentive to use as much water as possible rather than saving.&lt;ref name= ref4 /&gt;&lt;ref name= ref5 /&gt; This obviously causes costs of irrigation to be greater than the optimal amount which makes the policy very inefficient. However, by enacting Conserved Water Statutes, state legislatures are able to address the disincentives to save water.&lt;ref name= ref4 /&gt; The policy allows the appropriators to have rights over the surplus water and enforces them to verify their water savings by the water resources department.&lt;ref name= ref4 /&gt; Out of the four states that adapted the Conserved Water Statutes, Oregon is often renowned to be the most successful.&lt;ref name= ref4 /&gt; According to "How Expanding The Productivity of Water Rights Could Lessen Our Water Woes," Oregon’s Oregon Water Resources Department (OWRD) has been a success because a high percentage of submitted applications submitted, and the OWRD serves as a good intermediaries that help appropriators to conserve water. OWRD’s programs are not only a success because its effectiveness but also because of their efforts to improve the workers’ working conditions.&lt;ref name= ref4 /&gt;&lt;ref name= ref5&gt;http://www.oregon.gov/oha/oei/Pages/cultural-competency.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; According to OWRD's website, the state policies regarding the water rights are divided into Cultural Competency, Traditional Health Worker, [[Coordinated Care Organizations]], and Race, Ethnicity and Language Data Collection.&lt;ref name= ref5 /&gt;

====C) Water pollution in Malaysia====
In [[Malaysia]], the citizens have been experiencing harms from water pollutants in the river that have been accumulating over decades due to fast growing urbanization and industrialization.&lt;ref name= malaysia&gt;Muyibi, S. A., Ambali, A. R., &amp; Eissa, G. S. (2008). Development-induced water pollution in malaysia: Policy implications from an econometric analysis. Water Policy, 10(2), 193-206&lt;/ref&gt; The planners of Malaysia have been trying to coming up with models that indicate the amount of pollutants has grown over time as cities became more industrialized and how these chemicals are distributed in various regions with the usage of econometrics and various scientific tools.&lt;ref name= malaysia /&gt; Such an attempt is encourages in-depth researches because sources should be able to analyzed numerically and give economic evaluations while also evaluating the environment.&lt;ref name= ber&gt;Bernardo, D. J., Mapp, H. P., Sabbagh, G. J., Geleta, S., Watkins, K. B., Elliott, R. L., &amp; Stone, J. F. (1993). Economic and environmental impacts of water quality protection policies. 1. framework for regional analysis. Water Resources Research, 29(9), 3069-3080.&lt;/ref&gt; With abundance of evidences provided by models which reveal the inadequacy of current policies, the Malaysian decisions-makers now recognize that appropriate treatments are necessary in regions that are industrialized to protect the residents from water pollutants.&lt;ref name= malaysia /&gt;&lt;ref name= fao /&gt; As a result, the government seeks to increase public awareness and provide affordable water services to residents by year 2020.&lt;ref name= fao&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/ab776e/ab776e02.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits of impact assessments ===
Successful policies and assessments integrate environmental, economical, and social consequences which provides better models and potential future improvements of the policies. Understanding the importance of water policies and impact assessments is a crucial part of both water justice and environmental justice issues. Not only does it help to protect the quality of water but also the quality of living for humans who are directly affected by the environment.

In addition, successful policies goes beyond water issues. Beneficial policies that are intended to benefit the general public touches upon subjects such as transportation and other environmental policies that may have significant impact on the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name= whole&gt;https://www.wholecommunities.org/pdf/WTJ4text%20and%20cover.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of mere cost-benefit analysis, decisions are made so that they account for the priorities of the people.&lt;ref name= whole /&gt;

Notable benefits of impact assessments is as follows:
* comprehensive picture of the policy impacts. New models projected possible outcomes of different simulation of the proposed policies under various circumstances. In addition, they provided the optimal decisions to be made regarding each outcome through the usage of what is known as computable general equilibrium (CGE) which “integrate dynamics on a catchment scale”&lt;ref name= reef /&gt;&lt;ref name= reefsupport /&gt;
* aggregation of both economics aspects of water and non-monetary elements of water usage.&lt;ref name= reef /&gt;&lt;ref name= reefsupport /&gt;
* acknowledging the fact that farm production should depend on the global dynamics.&lt;ref name= reef /&gt;&lt;ref name= reefsupport /&gt;
* Protection of the human rights of the workers and improvements in working conditions.&lt;ref name= ref4 /&gt;&lt;ref name= ref5 /&gt;
* Provision of data that can be analyzed in terms of the economy, health impacts, and recognition of the need for appropriate treatments.&lt;ref name= malaysia /&gt;&lt;ref name= fao /&gt;

[[File:Duke of Wellington Photo cleaned.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Prime Minister [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] gave the ministry its name in shouting "Who? Who?" as each new cabinet member was announced in the [[House of Lords]]. He died two months before the ministry collapsed.]]
[[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby]] led the "'''Who? Who?'''" '''ministry''', a short-lived British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government which was in power for a matter of months in 1852. Lord Derby was Prime Minister and [[Benjamin Disraeli]] served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. It marked the first time the [[protectionist]] wing of the Conservative Party had taken office since the [[Corn Laws]] schism of 1846. It is also called the '''first Derby–Disraeli ministry''' {{harv|Tout|1910}}.

Early in 1852 [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], by then very deaf, gave Derby's first government its nickname by shouting "'''Who? Who?'''" as the list of inexperienced Cabinet Ministers was read out in the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyhome.co.uk/pms/derby.htm |title=Biography-Edward George Geoffrey Smith Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby (1799–1869) |last=Bloy |first=Marjorie |work=A Web of English History |year=2011 |accessdate=6 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110514090500/http://www.historyhome.co.uk/pms/derby.htm| archivedate= 14 May 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyhome.co.uk/pms/derby.htm|title=A Web of English History|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|1852 vote of no confidence in the government of Lord Derby}}
After the fall of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]'s [[Whig Government 1846-1852|Whig government]] in early 1852, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] leader Lord Derby formed a government. The conservatives had been weakened by the defection of the [[Peelite]]s, and many of the new Cabinet ministers were men of little experience. The government became known as the Who? Who? Ministry due to the lack of prominence of its ministers. The government was in a significant minority, and lasted less than a year, collapsing in December. The [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and Peelites then formed a [[Coalition Government 1852-1855|coalition government]] under the Peelite leader [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]].

Though the government had little impact, it attracted derision through its plethora of new political names, which demonstrated the relative inexperience of the party. Only four members of the Cabinet (Derby himself, St Leonards, Lonsdale, and Herries) were existing [[Privy Councillor]]s and many others were complete political unknowns.

The '''World Water Council''' is an international [[think tank]] founded in 1996, with its headquarters in [[Marseille]], [[France]]. It has 341 members (March 2017) mainly from the [[private sector]] (multinational power, construction, engineering and manufacturing companies), but also from the UN and intergovernmental organizations, [[governments]] and [[ministry (government department)|ministries]], academic institutions, [[international organizations]], [[local governments]], and civil society groups. Founders and constituent members of the World Water Council include the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage, the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]](IUCN), the [[International Water Association]] (IWA), [[AquaFed]] (The International Federation of Private Water Operators), [[Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux]], the United Nations agencies [[UNDP]] and [[UNESCO]], and the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/fileadmin/world_water_council/documents/official_documents/Constitution_By-Laws_2016_2018.pdf World Water Council Constitution &amp; By-Laws]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Its stated mission is "to promote awareness, build political commitment and trigger action on critical water issues at all levels, including the highest decision-making level, to facilitate the efficient [[water conservation|conservation]], protection, [[water development|development]], planning, [[water management|management]], and use of water in all its dimensions on an environmentally [[sustainable]] basis for the benefit of all life on earth."

Every third year the World Water Council organizes the [[World Water Forum]] in close collaboration with the authorities of the hosting country. The Forum is the largest international event in the field of water. The 6th World Water Forum took place in Marseille, France, in 2012 and the 7th World Water Forum in Daegu-Gyeongbuk, Republic of Korea, in April 2015. The 8th World Water Forum took place in Brasilia, Brazil, from 18 to 23 March 2018 under the overarching theme 'Sharing Water'. 

The World Water Council is financed primarily through membership fees, and additional support is provided by the host City of Marseille. Specific projects and programs are financed through donations and grants from governments, international organizations, and [[NGO]]'s.

== Colleges and membership distribution (as of March 2017)==
World Water Council members are divided into 5 colleges:
* College 1: Intergovernmental institutions - 4%
* College 2: Governments and government authorities - 23%
* College 3: Enterprises and facilities - 30%
* College 4: Civil society organizations and water user associations - 17%
* College 5: Professional associations and academic institutions - 26%

== Criticism ==
Critics accuse the World Water Council of promoting the [[water privatization|privatisation of water]] supply, an indication of this is the large influence of financial institutions and global [[water corporation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Maude Barlow and Tony Clarke, "Blue Gold: The Battle Against Corporate Theft of the World's Water" (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian activist [[Tony Clarke (activist)|Tony Clarke]] describes the World Water Council as a [[smoke screen]] for the water lobby. [[Medha Patkar]], an activist from India, gave a passionate speech against privatisation of water at the 2nd World Water Forum in The Hague in 2000.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_5ZbzmymE4]
