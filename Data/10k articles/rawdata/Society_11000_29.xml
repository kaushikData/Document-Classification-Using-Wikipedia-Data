'''Abu Tubar''' (literally ''The Hatchet Man&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Makiya|first=Kanan|title=Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520214390|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;'') was the name given to the perpetrator of a series of robberies and murders committed in [[Baghdad]] during the early years of the [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-led faction)|Ba'ath Party]] rule. Although eventually ascribed to former members of [[Nadhim Kzar]]'s (chief of the [[Directorate of General Security]]) police force, at the time there was widespread fear amongst the Baghdad population about the nature of the crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Juman|first=Kubba|title=The First Evidence : A Memoir of Life in Iraq under Saddam Hussein|year=2003|publisher=McFarland|location=London|isbn=0786415800|pages=30–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu Tubar has achieved the title "hatchet man" in early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Kubba, J. (2003). The first evidence: A memoir of life in Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Jefferson, N.C: McFarland &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; His real name is '''حاتم كاظم هضم''' (Hatem Kazem Hathom); born 1932 in the city of Babylon, [[Hilla]] in '''Iraq'''.&lt;ref&gt;Al Saadi, M. (2014). A Doctor From Mesopotamia. United Kingdom: Author House.&lt;/ref&gt; He is known as the man who brought fear and terror to the civilians of Iraq. He has a reputation of murdering families by chopping them with his hatchet.&lt;ref&gt;Al Saadi, M. (2014). A Doctor From Mesopotamia. United Kingdom: Author House.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kubba, J. (2003). The first evidence: A memoir of life in Iraq under Saddam Hussein.

The call consists of useless conversation, threatening, and cursing. After the phone call, there is a knock on the door, after which the crime begins.&lt;ref&gt;Kubba, J. (2003). The first evidence: A memoir of life in Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Jefferson, N.C: McFarland &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Experience in Iraq==
The citizens of Iraq at the time became worried and very fearful. People in [[Baghdad]] became more cautious; they became very protective. Individuals no longer went out alone, began to trim any trees and bushes around the neighbourhood to have a clear view of any potential hiding areas, and added more lights to keep them on all night for security.&lt;ref&gt;Kubba, J. (2003). The first evidence: A memoir of life in Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Jefferson, N.C: McFarland &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Being used to the safe environment in Iraq, these acts of Abu Tubar created tension and anxiety, which paralyzed the country. People began to create curfews for themselves and locked their homes more regularly. Television programs began to give safety instructions to viewers and so did call-in shows to train the citizens what to do if they saw him or any suspicious acts being found.&lt;ref&gt;Kubba, J. (2003). The first evidence: A memoir of life in Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Jefferson, N.C: McFarland &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
He lived in Babylon, Hilla and came from a very well-known and generous family in Iraq. He graduated elementary school in 1946 and graduated middle school in 1949. After that, he went to a police school in Hilla and ended up graduating in 1951 with a commissioner rank of police of Hilla but was fired in 1952 for professional reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Police stations in the history of Iraq: read in the file of crimes, "Abu Tabar" after 40 years.

After getting expelled, he traveled to [[Kuwait]] to study free business in 1957, then returned to Iraq in 1959 to work as a collections accountant in [[Kirkuk]]. He got sentenced two and a half years in jail due to damaging (?) the company's state funds. After serving the time in jail, he left to explore Europe, spending most of his time in West Germany, [[Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;Police stations in the history of Iraq: read in the file of crimes, "Abu Tabar" after 40 years.

==The After==
On March 30, 1974; 2:55 P.M. there was a report of a thief entering a neighbour's house that belonged to Doctor Joseph Paul Pedros Jadraji.&lt;ref&gt;Police stations in the history of Iraq: read in the file of crimes, "Abu Tabar" after 40 years.

A Doctor From Mesopotamia. United Kingdom: Author House&lt;/ref&gt; The police came in time to catch the thief but their records showed Hatem as one of the air forces. This allowed him to keep lying about what he had done until they asked him to show them his house. They found many stolen items in his home, from expensive radios to jewellery and clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Police stations in the history of Iraq: read in the file of crimes, "Abu Tabar" after 40 years.

&lt;/ref&gt; (also '''Anthony's triangle''') is an organizational model. The triangle takes a hierarchical view of [[management]] structure, with many operational decisions at the bottom, some [[Tactical (disambiguation)|tactical]] decisions in the middle and few but important [[Strategy|strategic]] decisions at the top of the triangle. The higher in the triangle an item is, the more scope it covers and less precise it becomes. As items move down they become more detailed and apply more precisely.

It came to the attention of the [[information systems]] community through the work of George Gorry and [[Michael Scott Morton]].&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Australian Intelligence Community''' ('''AIC''') and the '''National Intelligence Community''' ('''NIC''') or '''National Security Community''' of the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] are the collectives of statutory intelligence agencies, policy departments, and other government agencies concerned with protecting and advancing the national security and national interests of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]]. The intelligence and security agencies of the Australian Government have evolved since the [[Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]] and saw transformation and expansion during the [[Global War on Terrorism]] in response to current international and domestic security issues such as terrorism, [[violent extremism]], [[cybersecurity]], [[transnational crime]], [[counter-proliferation]], support to military operations, and [[Australia's security relationship with the South Pacific|Pacific regional instability]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dpmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/2011-iric-report.pdf] 2011 Independent Review of the Intelligence Community&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Security Committee (Australia)|National Security Committee of Cabinet]] (NSC) is a Cabinet committee and the peak Australian Government decision-making body for national security, intelligence, foreign policy, and defence matters. It is chaired by the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] and is composed of the Deputy Prime Minister, [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]], [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]], [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]], [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]], and [[Minister for Home Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Home Affairs]].

The Australian Government 2008 National Security Strategy defined the Australian Intelligence Community (AIC) as the six core intelligence agencies ([[Office of National Assessments]] (ONA), [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] (ASIO), [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service]] (ASIS), [[Defence Intelligence Organisation]] (DIO), [[Australian Signals Directorate]] (ASD), [[Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation]] (AGO)) and the National Intelligence Community (NIC) as policy departments and other government agencies such as the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]] and the [[Australian Federal Police]].&lt;ref name="asio.gov.au"&gt;[https://www.asio.gov.au/national-intelligence-community-nic.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225214117/https://www.asio.gov.au/national-intelligence-community-nic.html |date=25 December 2016 }} ASIO overview of the National Intelligence Community&lt;/ref&gt; The Office of National Assessments further classifies the six agencies of the Australian Intelligence Community as collection (ASIO, ASIS, ASD, AGO) or assessment agencies (ONA, DIO). The [[Office of National Assessments]] itself plays a unique all-source intelligence assessment and intergovernmental co-ordination role.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[https://www.ona.gov.au/about-ona/overview/australian-intelligence-community] Office of National Assessments overview of the Australian Intelligence Community&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[middle power]] and [[G20]] economy in the international community and a [[regional power]] in the Asia-Pacific and [[Indo-Pacific]], Australia has played a major role in [[international security]]. The Australian Government is a member of the [[Five Eyes]] intelligence community, the [[Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty]], the [[Five Power Defence Arrangements]], and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The [[foreign relations of Australia|foreign policy of Australia]] is guided by its commitment to multilateralism and the [[Australia and the United Nations|United Nations]] and [[Regionalism (international relations)|regionalism]] with the [[Pacific Islands Forum]] and the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] alongside strong bilateral relations particularly in Oceania, Southeast Asia, the [[Australia–United States relations|alliance with the United States]], and [[Australia–China relations]].

The [[Australian Defence Force]] has also deployed around the world for [[United Nations peacekeeping]], regional [[peacekeeping operations]] including with the [[Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands]] and the [[International Force for East Timor]], humanitarian relief, counterterrorism and special operations, border security in [[Operation Resolute]], [[Surveillance#Aerial|airborne surveillance operations]] and maritime monitoring operations in the South China Sea and South West Pacific,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lowyinstitute.org/issues/south-china-sea] [[Lowy Institute]] overview of the South China Sea&lt;/ref&gt; counterinsurgency and security assistance such as with the [[International Security Assistance Force]] in Afghanistan with [[Miltary history of Australia during the War in Afghanistan|Operation Slipper and Operation Highroad]], and the fight against [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] with [[Operation Okra]].

Domestically, the rise of [[violent extremism]] and threats of both [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic]] and [[right-wing terrorism|right-wing]] [[Terrorism in Australia|terrorism]] are key concerns of the Australian Government. [[Crime in Australia]], including [[cybercrime]] and [[transnational crime]] such as [[human trafficking]], [[arms trafficking]], and the [[illegal drug trade]], are ongoing risks to the security and safety of Australia.

in 10 of 17 [[Landtag of Bavaria#Election results 1946.E2.80.932008|elections 1946&amp;ndash;2013]] receiving the absolute majority of the popular vote, and in all but one receiving the largest fraction of the popular vote, with the sole exception of the 1950 election (beaten by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] 28.0% to 27.4%).&lt;/ref&gt; and also the party of all [[List of Ministers-President of Bavaria|Ministers-President of Bavaria]] since 1946, with the single exception of [[Wilhelm Hoegner]], 1954–1957.

==Areal and dialectal subdivision==
[[File:Bairisches Mundartgebiet.PNG|thumb|Bavarian (Austro-Bavarian) speaking areas.]]
There is no ethno-linguistic distinction between Bavarians and [[Austrians]]. The territory of Bavaria has changed significantly over German history;&lt;ref&gt;the current borders of the state of Bavaria date to 1955 (incorporation of [[Lindau]]); apart from Lindau, Bavaria had been defined after [[World War II]] with the incorporation of formerly Thuringian [[Ostheim vor der Rhön]] and the loss of [[Electorate Palatinate]]. Apart from these changes, Bavaria corresponds to territory of the [[kingdom of Bavaria]] within the [[German Confederation]] as defined in 1816.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 19th century the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] acquired substantial territories of [[Franconia]] and [[Swabia (Bavaria)|Swabia]], while having to return territories to [[Austria]] who had become Bavarian only a few years earlier. Thus, only three of the seven administrative regions of the state of Bavaria are culturally Bavarian: [[Upper Bavaria]] (Oberbayern), [[Lower Bavaria]] (Niederbayern) and the [[Upper Palatinate]] (Oberpfalz), to the exclusion of Bavarian [[Franconia]] (historically inhabited by [[Franks]]) and [[Bavarian Swabia]] (inhabited by [[Swabians]]).

The [[Bavarian language]] is divided into three main dialects:
* Upper Palatinian (''Oberpfälzisch'') is spoken in northern Bavaria ([[Bohemian Forest]], [[Regensburg]]). 
* Danube Bavarian (''Donaubairisch'') is spoken in central and south-eastern Bavaria and in Central and [[Lower Austria]] ([[Munich]], [[Salzburg]], [[Vienna]]). 
* Alpine Bavarian is spoken in south-western Bavaria, in southern [[Austria]] ([[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria]]) and in [[South Tyrol]].

===Origins===
''Bavarii'' or ''Baiuvarii'' was the term for a population from the [[Bohemian Forest]] area (which had been the territory of the [[Boii]] during antiquity) from the 6th century; the name is Latinized from a possible self-designation ''*Baio-warioz'', apparently intended to mean "men of [[Bohemia]]". "Bohemia" (Boiohaemum), apparently meaning "Boii home" in a Germanic language, was a term already mentioned by [[Tacitus]] in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' at the end of the 1st century AD, by which time the Celtic Boii had already long left the area,{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} leaving it to be settled by [[Suevi]]c [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] groups in close contact with the Romans, such as the [[Marcomanni]]. On the southern side of the [[river Danube]] was the Roman controlled province of [[Raetia]].

Bavarians are first mentioned in the mid 6th century, in the foothills north of the [[Alps]], on both sides of the [[Danube river]]. It is difficult to distinguish the mobile and mixing groups of the Danube in this period archaeologically. The timing comes after the period when the neighbouring [[Alamanni]] (to the west) and [[Thuringians]] (to the north) had come under [[Franks|Frankish]] hegemony, and in Italy the kingdoms of [[Theoderic]] and [[Odoacer]] had come to and end, creating a new power vacuum in the Alpine region. They seem to have been closely related to the [[Lombards]] who were developing as a force to the east of them. Their legal system shows heavy Roman influence, and their unification appears to have been under a Duke installed by the Franks. (Old Bavarian law codes refer to five main lineages.)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Halsall| title=Barbarian Migrations and the Roman West 376-568 |page=405| year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danubian frontier between the Roman empire and "[[Germania]]" had by this time become a region where older populations had been added to significantly by generations of Roman border troops, Germanic clients, and then various "[[barbarian]]" peoples from outside the empire, some of whom had been under the hegemony of [[Attila]] the Hun.&lt;ref&gt;''Hunnic' modified skulls: physical appearance, identity and the transformative nature of migrations''. In Essays in Burial Archaeology in Honour of Heinrich Härke. S Hakenbeck 2009&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Elbe Germans]]", came from the [[Elbe river]] to the north, which was under Thuringian rule, and is where the Lombards had also been. But also more northern groups had moved along the Elbe from the direction of the [[North Sea]], as did some [[Saxon]]s who joined the Lombards, and possibly the [[Heruls]]. Also, [[East Germanic]] groups such as the [[Goth]]s had entered the [[Pannonia]]n region east of the Bavarians in the generations leading up to the empire of Attila. These peoples had not only contributed to the Hunnic empire, but also sometimes been settled peacefully as Roman ''[[foederati]]''.

Also entering the area, more contemporary with the Bavarians and Lombards, were [[early Slavs|Slavs]], who particularly settled the Upper Palatinate as well as around Regensburg itself (distr. Großprüfening)&lt;ref&gt;''Die Slawen''. In Die Bajuwaren. Von Severin bis Tassilo 488-788. Von Vlasta Tvornik.

Pg 637-38; in Die Anfänge Bayerns Von Raetien und Noricum zur Frühmittelalterlichen Baiovaria herausgegeben.

Neighboring the emerging Bavarian people in the 6th to 7th centuries were the Alamanni to the west (with the [[Lech River]] as boundary, which remains a dialectal division today), and Thuringians to the north, both dominated to some extent by the Franks as were the Bavarians. (In the late 7th century however, there was a period where [[Radulf, King of Thuringia]] rebelled and some independence was returned to these three regions for a while.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Heather| page=366|title=Empires and Barbarians|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) [[West Slavs|Slavs]] were settling to the north-east, and [[Goths]] and [[Langobards]] to the east and south were later displaced by [[Slavic migrations|Slavs]] and [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Magyars]].

Much like was the case in neighboring [[Alemannia]], Bavaria was nominally Christian by virtue of being ruled by Christian dukes from the 6th century, but Christianization of its population was a gradual process lasting throughout the 7th century and into the 8th; Saint [[Corbinian]] was sent by [[Pope Gregory II]] to minister to duke [[Grimoald of Bavaria|Grimoald]] and work towards the evangelization of Bavaria; he became the first [[bishop of Freising]]. A [[Ancient Diocese of Laureacum|Diocese of Laureacum (Lorch)]] had been in existence since the 4th century, in the 8th century moved to [[Diocese of Passau|Passau]], which became a bridge-head for the Christianization of Austria and Hungary. The [[Bishopric of Regensburg]] was founded in 739 by [[Saint Boniface|Boniface]]. The [[Lex Baiuvariorum]] was a codex of [[Germanic law]], comprising 23 articles of traditional law recorded in the 740s. Bavaria within the [[Carolingian Empire]] was bordering on [[Alamannia|Swabia]] in the west, [[Duchy of Thuringia|Thuringia]] in the north, [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombardy]] in the south and [[March of Carinthia|Slavic Carinthia]] in the east.

===Holy Roman Empire===
The [[Duchy of Bavaria]] was a [[stem duchy]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], established in the 10th century, derived from an earlier duchy ruled by the Frankish [[Agilolfings]] during the 6th to 8th centuries.
 
The [[Margraviate of Austria]] was formed an eastern march to the Duchy of Bavaria in 976, and became a duchy in its own right, the [[Duchy of Austria]], in 1156, in the 13th century falling under the dominion of the [[House of Habsburg]].
In the 14th and 15th centuries, upper and lower Bavaria were repeatedly subdivided. Four Duchies (or "partial duchies", ''Teilherzogtümer'') existed after the division of 1392: Lower [[Bavaria-Straubing]], lower [[Bavaria-Landshut]], [[Bavaria-Ingolstadt]] and [[Bavaria-Munich]].

[[Munich]], now the capital and cultural center of Bavaria, was founded in the high medieval period, and was the capital 
of the "partial duchy" of [[Bavaria-Munich]] 1392&amp;ndash;1503. In 1503, Bavaria was re-united by Duke [[Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria|Albrecht IV]] of Bavaria-Munich (although the formerly Bavarian offices [[Kufstein]], [[Kitzbühel]] and [[Rattenberg]] in Tirol were lost in 1504) and established Munich as the capital of all of Bavaria in 1506.
In 1623, Bavaria was elevated to [[Electorate of Bavaria|Electorate]] (''Kurfürstentum'').

===Modern history===
[[File:Deutscher Bund.png|thumb|right|Kingdom of Bavaria within the [[German Confederation]] 1816, including the Rhenish Palatinate]]
The [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] was established at the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)]], in the wake of the French victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]]. The kingdom's territory fluctuated greatly over the following years, eventually fixed at the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] (1814), which established most of what remain the borders of the modern state. The kingdom in 1837 was divided into eight administrative regions (''Regierungsbezirke''), ''[[Upper Bavaria]]'', ''[[Lower Bavaria]]'', ''[[Franconia]]'', ''[[Swabia]]'', ''[[Upper Palatinate]]'' and ''[[Electorate of the Palatinate|Palatinate]]''. 
[[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] changed his royal titles to ''Ludwig, King of Bavaria, Duke of Franconia, Duke in Swabia and Count Palatinate of the Rhine''.

As of 1818, the total population of the kingdom was at 3.7 million, rising to 4.4 million by 1840 and to 6.2 million by 1900, reaching 6.5 million in 1910. Modern Bavaria has 12.5 million inhabitants (as of 2012);&lt;ref&gt;area 70,549 km², not identical with the territory of the kingdom of Bavaria, which had an area of 75,865 km² in 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; 
the population of [[Altbayern]] or Bavaria proper is at 6.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;2012 data: [[Upper Bavaria]] 4.4 million, [[Lower Bavaria]] 1.2 million, [[Upper Palatinate]] 1.1 million.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chink''' (also '''chinki''', '''chinky''', '''chinkie''', '''chinka''', '''chinkapoo''' or '''chinker''') is an English-language [[List of ethnic slurs|ethnic slur]] usually referring to a person of Chinese ethnicity.&lt;ref name="chink definition"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chink Chink | Definition of chink by Merriam-Webster&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The word is also sometimes indiscriminately used against people of [[East Asian]] appearance. The use of the term is considered offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hsu|first=Huan|title=No More Chinks in the Armor|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/the_good_word/2012/02/chink_in_the_armor_jeremy_lin_why_it_s_time_to_retire_the_phrase_for_good_.html|publisher=Slate|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McNeal|first=Greg|title=ESPN Uses "Chink in the Armor" Line Twice UPDATE- ESPN Fires One Employee Suspends Another|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2012/02/18/espn-uses-chink-in-the-armor-line-twice-did-linsanity-just-go-racist/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=9 May 2012|date=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Various dictionaries provide different etymologies of the word ''chink''; for example, that it originated from the Chinese courtesy ''ching-ching'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cassell's Dictionary of Slang|publisher=Orion Publishing Group|date=November 2005|isbn=0304366366}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that it evolved from the word ''China'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Slang|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=December 2003|isbn=0198607636}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that it was an alteration of ''Qing'' (''Ch'ing''), as in the [[Qing Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=21st Century Dictionary of Slang|publisher=Random House, Inc.|date=1994-01-01|isbn=978-0-440-21551-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible origin is that ''chink'' evolved from the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] word for China. That word is now pronounced similarly in various [[Indo-European languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Slang|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=December 2003|isbn=0-19-860763-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But this also comes from the Chin dynasty.

== History ==
[[File:Ironchinkworker.png|thumb|right|The ''Iron Chink'', a machine that guts and cleans salmon for canning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=2109|title=Automated salmon cleaning machine developed in Seattle in 1903|publisher=HistoryLink.org|date=2000-01-01|accessdate=2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] fishplant worker, was marketed as a replacement for fish-butchers, who were primarily Chinese immigrants]]

The first recorded use of the word ''chink'' is from approximately 1880.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As far as can be ascertained, its adjective form, ''chinky,'' first appeared in print in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Tom Dalzell |editor2=Terry Victor |title=New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|publisher=Routledge|date=2005-05-12|isbn=978-0-415-21258-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The derogatory word [[Chinky]] remains in use in Britain as slang for [[Chinese food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kpearson.faculty.tcnj.edu/Dictionary/chink.htm |title=Chink (chingk) |publisher=Interactive Dictionary of Racial Language |accessdate=2007-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612135015/http://kpearson.faculty.tcnj.edu/Dictionary/chink.htm |archivedate=2007-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the turn of the 20th century, many white North American perceived Chinese immigration as a threat to their living standards. However, Chinese workers were still desired on the West Coast due to a persistent labor shortage. Chinese butcher crews were held in such high esteem that when Edmund A. Smith patented his mechanized fish-butchering machine in 1905, he named it the ''Iron Chink'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Smith's Iron Chink - One Hundred Years of the Mechanical Fish Butcher |author=Jo Scott B |journal=British Columbia History |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=21–22 |url=http://www.canfisco.com/wildsalmon/salmon_history.asp?article=17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023023411/http://www.canfisco.com/wildsalmon/salmon_history.asp?article=17 |archivedate=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://stories.washingtonhistory.org/leschi/teaching/pdfs/sts-ironchink.pdf| quote=The myth arose that Edmund Smith had designed the machine specifically to fire Chinese workers| title= Revolution on a Dare; Edmund A.

Griffith]]. Griffith altered the story to be more racially sensitive and renamed it to ''[[Broken Blossoms]]''.

Although ''chink'' refers to those appearing to be of Chinese descent, the term has also been directed towards people of other East and Southeast Asian ethnicities. Literature and film about the Vietnam war contain examples of this usage, including the film ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986) and the play ''[[Sticks and Bones]]'' (1971, also [[Sticks and Bones (film)|later filmed]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Platoon.html Accessed March 31, 2007.{{verify source|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, April 26th, 1971, p. 10.{{verify source|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chink'' has been compared in degree of offensiveness to terms such as ''[[nigger]]'', dago, [[Jap]], and ''[[kike]]'',&lt;ref name=croom&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0388000110000975|last=Croom |first=Adam M. |title=Slurs |journal=Language Sciences |volume=33 |issue=3 |date=May 2011 |pages=343–358 |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1016/j.langsci.2010.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''[[Paki (slur)|paki]]'' ([[Pakistani]]).&lt;ref name=paki1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1482220148 Get Through MRCGP: Clinical Skills Assessment 2E], Bruno Rushforth, Val Wass, Valerie Wass, 2012, pp. 242, {{ISBN|1482220148}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Similar to the controversial [[reappropriation]] of the word ''nigger'', the word ''chink'' has sometimes been used in a positive manner.&lt;ref name=croom/&gt; For example, [[Leehom Wang]], a Taiwanese American musician, named his Asian hip-hop fusion genre ''chinked-out'' in order to neutralize the term. Eventually Wang hopes the term will become "cool."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2006/01/13/2003288837|title=Pop Stop|publisher=Taipei Times|date=2006-01-13|accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

=== Australia ===
Racism against [[Chinese people]] exists in Australia, as in other English-speaking countries. The terms [[Chinaman (term)|Chinaman]] and ''chink'' became intertwined, as some Australians used both with hostile intent when referring to members of the country's Chinese population, which had swelled significantly during the [[Gold Rush]] era of the 1850s and 1860s.

Assaults on Chinese miners and racially motivated riots and public disturbances were not infrequent occurrences in Australia's mining districts in the second half of the 19th century. There was some resentment, too, of the fact that Chinese miners and laborers tended to send their earnings back home to their families in China rather than spending them in Australia and supporting the local economy.

In the popular Sydney ''[[The Bulletin|Bulletin]]'' magazine in 1887, one author wrote: "No nigger, no chink, no [[lascar]], no [[Kanakas|kanaka]] (laborer from the South Pacific islands), no purveyor of cheap labour, is an Australian."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hughes, Geoffrey. An Encyclopedia of Swearing. Armonk, New York: M.E. Sharpe, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, since-repealed federal government legislation was passed to restrict non-white immigration and thus protect the jobs of [[Anglo-Celtic]] Australian workers from "undesirable" competition.

=== India ===
In India, the ethnic slur ''chinki'' (or ''chinky'') is frequently directed against people with [[East Asia]]n features, including people from [[North-East India]] and [[Nepal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/northeast-students-question-racism-in-india/94320-3.html|title=Northeast students question 'racism' in India|publisher=CNN-IBN|date=June 6, 2009|accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are often mistaken for Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/world/asia/indians-protest-saying-a-death-was-tied-to-bias.html |title=Indians Protest, Saying a Death Was Tied to Bias |newspaper=New York Times |date=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[Minister for Home Affairs (India)|Indian Ministry of Home Affairs]] recognized use of the term "chinki" to refer to a member of the [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|Scheduled Tribes]] (especially in the North-East) as a criminal offense under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act with a penalty of up to five years in jail. The Ministry further warned that they would very seriously review any failure of the police to enforce this interpretation of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/north-east-racial-slur-home-ministry-sc--st-act-jail-term/1/198828.html/ |title=North-East racial slur could get you jailed for five years |first=Aman  |last=Sharma |work=indiatoday.intoday.in |date=3 June 2012 |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
The 1969 top 3 UK hit single for [[Blue Mink]], "Melting Pot", has the lyric: "take a pinch of white man/Wrap him up in black skin. [...] Mixed with yellow Chinkees. You know you lump it all together/And you got a recipe for a get-along scene/Oh what a beautiful dream/If it could only come true".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metrolyrics.com/melting-pot-lyrics-blue-mink.html&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst at the time expressing racial harmony, a modern audience may find the use of the word insensitive, undercutting the song's intent.

In 1999, an exam given to students in [[Scotland]] was criticized for containing a passage that students were told to interpret containing the word ''chinky''.  This exam was taken by students all over Scotland, and Chinese groups expressed offence at the use of this passage. The examinations body apologized, calling the passage's inclusion "an error of judgement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/380867.stm|title=Chinese 'slur' wins apology|publisher=BBC News|date=June 29, 1999|accessdate=2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
The [[Pekin, Illinois]] High School teams were officially known as the "Pekin Chinks" until 1981, when the school administration changed the name to the "Pekin Dragons". The event received national attention.&lt;ref name=CAMC&gt;{{cite web|title=1981: The Pekin Chinks high school team becomes the Pekin Dragons|url=http://www.ccamuseum.org/index.php/en/research/research-1900-1949/128-1981-the-pekin-chinks-high-school-team-becomes-the-pekin-dragons|website=Chinese-American Museum of Chicago|publisher=Chinese-American Museum of Chicago|accessdate=2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stainbrook&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stainbrook|first1=Michael|title=The hunt for 'Red' alternatives|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/highschool/ct-spt-0921-prep-sunday-special-mascots-sider-20140920-story.html|accessdate=2015-07-30|work=Chicago Tribune|date=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York City radio station, [[WQHT|Hot 97]], came under criticism for airing the ''[[USA for Indonesia|Tsunami Song]]''. Referring to the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], in which over an estimated 200,000 people died, the song used the phrase "screaming chinks" along with other offensive lyrics. The radio station fired a co-host and producer, and indefinitely suspended radio personality [[Miss Jones (radio personality)|Miss Jones]], who was later reinstated. Members of the Asian American community said Miss Jones' reinstatement condoned hate speech.&lt;ref name=hot97&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yellowworld.org/top_stories/295.html |title="Tsunami Song" Host Miss Jones Returns |publisher=Yellowworld.org |author=Fang, Jennifer, James Fujikawa |date=2005-02-16 |accessdate=2007-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718094830/http://yellowworld.org/top_stories/295.html |archivedate=July 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sarah Silverman]] appeared on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' in 2001, stirring up controversy when the word ''chink'' was used without the usual [[Bleep censor|bleep]] appearing over ethnic slurs on network television. The controversy led Asian activist and community leader [[Guy Aoki]] to appear on the talk show ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' along with Sarah Silverman. Guy Aoki alleged that Silverman did not believe that the term was offensive.&lt;ref name=AsianWeek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianweek.com/2001_08_24/news_polit_incor.html |title=ABC's Politically Incorrect Tackles Comedian's 'Chink' Joke |publisher=AsianWeek |date=2000-08-24 |accessdate=2007-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527211343/http://www.asianweek.com/2001_08_24/news_polit_incor.html |archivedate=May 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Philadelphia eatery, [[Chink's Steaks]], created controversy, appearing in [[Philadelphia Daily News]] and other newspapers. The restaurant was asked by Asian community groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oca-gp.org/pr03.htm|title=The OCA approves Chink's Steaks resolution|publisher=Organization of Chinese Americans - Greater Philadelphia Chapter|date=January 2004|accessdate=2007-03-22}}{{Dead link|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to change the name. The restaurant was named after the original Jewish-American owner's nickname, "Chink", derived from the ethnic slur due to his "slanty eyes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chapters.aaja.org/Philadelphia/csteaks.html |title=Only 21, she's leading steak-shop fight |publisher=The Asian American Journalists Association - Philadelphia |date=2004-04-01 |accessdate=2007-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403193647/http://chapters.aaja.org/Philadelphia/csteaks.html |archivedate=2007-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant was renamed Joe's in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/food/Chinks-Steaks-changing-its-name.html Chink's Steaks changing its name&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2013/04/01/iconic-northeast-philadelphia-cheesesteak-joint-changes-name/ Chink’s Steaks Sign No Longer Hanging In Northeast Philadelphia « CBS Philly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://joessteaks.com/ Joe's Steaks + Soda Shop&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/JoesSteaksSodaShop&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.angryasianman.com/2013/08/take-that-racists-eat-at-joes-formerly.html Take that, racists: Eat at Joe's (formerly Chink's Steaks)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phillymag.com/foobooz/2013/03/28/chinks-steaks-is-now-joes-steaks-soda-shop/ Chink's Steaks Is Now Joe's Steaks + Soda Shop - Foobooz&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During early 2000, [[University of California, Davis]] experienced a string of racial incidents and crimes between Asian and white students, mostly among [[fraternities]]. Several incidents included ''chink'' and other racial epithets being shouted among groups, including the slurs being used during a robbery and assault on an Asian fraternity by 15 white males. The incidents motivated a school-wide review and protest to get professional conflict resolution and "culturally sensitive" mediators.&lt;ref name=ucd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianweek.com/2001_02_16/bay1_ucdavisprotest.html |title=Hate Crimes Galvanize U.C.

'''Colombian Sign Language''' ({{lang-es|Lengua de Señas Colombiana (LSC)}}) is the [[deaf sign language]] of [[Colombia]].

==Description==
The development of the signs have influences of Spanish sign language and [[American Sign Language]].{{cn|date=April 2015}}  It is reported to have signs in common with [[Salvadoran Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{e18|csn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
There are two sign language schools in [[Bogotá]] (the first started in 1929), two in [[Medellín]] and one in [[Cali]].  Countrywide, three different institutions of support for deaf promotes the learning of the language.   The national Committee for the sign language promotes the research in the area, distributes the manual alphabet for spelling and the Grammar Dictionary and supports the organization for sign language teachers.  The now defunct national central of [[telecommunications]] TELECOM distributed a CD-ROM software for self-learning.

==Relevancy==
There is a growing interest for learning the sign language between the hearing people.  Some schools use sign language in the classroom. Interpreters are provided at important public events, and for college students.

Responsibility for [[criminal law]] and [[criminal justice]] in the [[United States]] is shared between the [[State governments of the United States|states]] and the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].

==Sources of law==
The federal government and all the states rely on the following.

===Common law===
{{main|Common law}}
Common law is [[law]] developed by judges through legal opinions, as opposed to [[statute law|statutes]] adopted through the legislative process or [[Regulation (law)|regulations]] issued by the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/C/CommonLaw.aspx Duhaime's Law Dictionary, "Definition of Common Law"]&lt;/ref&gt; A common law crime is thus a crime which was originally defined by judges.

Common law crimes no longer exist at the federal level, because of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[United States v. Hudson and Goodwin]]'', 11 U.S. 32 (1812).  The validity of common law crimes varies at the state level.  Although most states have abolished common law crimes, some have enacted "reception" statutes recognizing common law crimes when no similar statutory crime exists.

===Statutes===
All 50 states have their own penal codes. Therefore, for any particular crime somewhere, it would be necessary to look it up in that jurisdiction. However, statutes derive from the common law. For example, if a state's murder statute does not define "human being," that state's courts will rely on the common-law definition.&lt;ref&gt;''Keeler v. Superior Court'', 2 Cal. 3d 619 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{see also| Title 18 of the United States Code}}

====State vs. federal====
{{main|Federal crime in the United States}}
The states, since they possess the [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]], have the most general power to pass criminal laws in the United States. The federal government, since it can only exercise those [[Enumerated powers|powers granted to it by the Constitution]], can only pass criminal laws which are related to the powers granted to Congress. For example, drug crimes, which comprise a large percentage of federal criminal cases, are subject to federal control because drugs are a commodity for which there is an interstate market, thus making controlled substances subject to regulation by Congress in the [[Controlled Substances Act]] which was passed under the authority of the [[Commerce Clause]]. ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' affirmed Congress's power to regulate drug possession under the Controlled Substances Act under the powers granted to it by the Commerce Clause.

===Model Penal Code===
{{main|Model Penal Code}}
The [[Model Penal Code]] ("MPC") was created by the [[American Law Institute]] ("ALI") in 1962. In other areas of law, the ALI created [[Restatements of Law]], usually referred to just as Restatements. For example, there is a [[Restatement of Contracts]] and a [[Restatement of Torts, Second|Restatement of Torts]]. The MPC is their equivalent for criminal law.

Many states have wholly or largely adopted the MPC. Others have implemented it in part, and still others have not adopted any portion of it. However, even in jurisdictions where it has not been adopted, the MPC is often cited as persuasive authority in the same way that Restatements are in other areas of law.

==Theories of punishment==
{{main|Criminal justice|Criminology|Penology|Justice|Retributive justice|Utilitarianism|Deterrence (legal)|Sentence (law)}}

==Principle of legality==
{{main|Ex post facto#United States|Void for vagueness|Principle of legality|Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali}}
An overarching concept in American criminal law is that people may not be punished for committing merely immoral or unethical acts. They can only be punished if that act has been announced beforehand as a crime.

==Burden of proof==
{{main|Philosophic burden of proof|Legal burden of proof|Presumption of innocence|Reasonable doubt|Standard of proof}}
In the United States, the [[adversarial system]] is used. The prosecution must prove each element of the alleged crime beyond a reasonable doubt for conviction.&lt;ref&gt;''[[In re Winship]]'', 397 U.S. 358 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
Crimes can generally be reduced to ''actus reus'' elements and ''mens rea'' elements. ''Actus reus'' elements are elements which describe conduct. ''Mens rea'' elements are elements which identify a particular mental state. 

===Actus reus===
{{main|Actus reus}}
The phrase "actus reus" is typically translated as "guilty act."

====Voluntary act====
{{expandsection|date=March 2016}}
Ordinarily, a voluntary act refers to commission. However, as discussed below, some crimes do punish failure to act.  A status is not a voluntary act. For example, no law will be constitutional that makes it a crime to be ''addicted'' to illegal drugs, as opposed to ''using'' them, as happened in ''[[Robinson v. California]]''.&lt;ref&gt;370 U.S. 660 (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Omission=====
{{expandsection|date=March 2016}}
Failure to do something can occasionally be criminal. For example, not paying one's taxes is criminal. Typically, the criminality of failing to act will be codified.

======Status relationships======
{{expandsection|date=March 2016}}
Certain relationships create a duty to act at common law, such as spouse to spouse, parent to child, or employer to employee, for example.

======Contractual duty======
{{expandsection|date=March 2016}}
A person may contract to act, such as a babysitter to render aid in the event of the child in her care hurting himself.

======Creation of risk======
{{expandsection|date=March 2016}}
A person typically has a duty to act when he is responsible for putting the other in peril in the first place, such as through accidental injury.

======Creation of reliance======
A person may have a duty to act when he begins to act but then stops. This situation typically arises in the hypothetical where a person is drowning. One bystander among many starts swimming out to rescue him but simply changes his mind halfway and decides to turn around and go back to shore alone. The rationale for holding the bystander culpable is that the other bystanders did nothing because of his act. If the bystander had been the only person around, he would not be causing others not to assist, so he would not be culpable.

===Social harm===
Criminal law is distinguishable from tort law or contract law, for example, in that society as a whole is theoretically damaged. Obviously, there are particular victims, but society as a whole is the party responsible for the case against and, in the event of a conviction, punishment of the criminal. Social harm is that part of the crime that is sought to be avoided.

===Mens rea===
{{main|Mens rea}}
The phrase mens rea is typically translated as "guilty mind" and focuses on the mental state of the accused.  

General intent is an awareness of factors constituting the crime; including [[attendant circumstances]]. The person must be aware that he is acting in a proscibed way and be aware of a high likelihood that [[attendant circumstances]] will occur.  The requisite intent may be inferred from the doing of the act.

A [[specific intent]] crime requires the doing of an act coupled with specific intent or objective. Specific intent cannot be inferred from the doing of the act.  The major specific intent crimes are: 
[[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] (intent to have crime completed), [[attempt]] (intent to complete a crime - whether specific or not, but falling short in completing the crime), [[Solicitation#United_States|solicitation]] (intent to have another person commit a crime), [[embezzlement]] (intent to defraud), first degree premeditated murder (premeditation), false pretenses (intent to defraud), forgery (intent to defraud), [[Larceny#United_States|larceny]] &amp; [[Robbery#United_States|robbery]] (intent to permanently deprive other of interest in property taken), [[assault]] (intent to commit battery) and [[Burglary#United_States|burglary]] (intent to commit felony in dwelling).

A [[Strict liability (criminal)|strict liability]] crime, however, does not require that a mens rea be found.

The [[Model_Penal_Code#Mens_rea_or_Culpability|MPC]] also addresses intent. One of its major innovations is the use of standardized [[mens rea]] terms (in MPC terms, culpability) to determine levels of mental states, just as homicide is considered more severe if done intentionally rather than accidentally. These terms are (in descending order) "[[Intention (criminal law)|purposely]]", "knowingly," "[[Recklessness (law)|recklessly]]", "[[Criminal negligence|negligently]]", and "[[Strict liability (criminal)|strict liability]]". Each material element of every crime has an associated culpability state that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.

===Causation===

====Actual cause====
Actual cause (also called "cause-in-fact") holds that the defendant cannot be criminally liable unless it can be shown that he was the cause-in-fact of the prohibited result. In order to find a defendant guilty, a court must be able to affirmatively answer the question, "But for the defendant’s conduct, would the prohibited result have occurred when it did?" 

There are some exceptions to the but-for test, however. For example, in a case where multiple wrongdoers "overdetermine" the harm that a victim would have experienced.

====Proximate cause====
The requirement of proximate cause (also called "legal" cause) restricts criminal liability to those cases where the harmful result which ensued was a foreseeable result of defendant's conduct. It is often phrased that the harmful result must be the "natural or probable" consequence of defendant's conduct.

===Concurrence of actus reus and mens rea===
Concurrence means the ''mens rea'' (mental state or guilty mind) coincides with the ''actus reus'' elements.  X hates Y and knows that she plays soccer every July 4 at a certain park.  July 4, 2010, X goes on a high hill overlooking the field that Y is playing on, and then intentionally dislodges a large boulder, and directs it towards Y intending to kill her.  If it kills her, concurrence is complete.  
Same situation, only the boulder rolls halfway down the hill, then gets lodged on a tree.  X does everything he can to dislodge the boulder, but cannot do so.  He gives up.  July 4, 2011, the boulder becomes dislodged in a storm (or otherwise becomes dislodged in any way other than X dislodging it with the intention of killing Y).  The boulder kills Y, just as X intended one year ago.  There is no concurrence, and X committed no crime.

==Affirmative defenses==
There are two categories of affirmative defenses: justification and excuse. Justifications differ from excuses in that a successful justification will show the defendant's conduct was not wrong, whereas a successful excuse does not show the defendant's conduct was wrong. A successful excuse shows that, while the defendant's conduct was regrettable, this particular defendant will not be subject to punishment. 

===Justification===
Justification defenses are full defenses. Society essentially tells the actor that he did nothing wrong under the circumstances.

====Self-defense====
An accused will typically raise this [[Right of self-defense|defense]] when he is defending a crime of battery or homicide. Under common law, a person may use non-deadly force to defend himself from a non-deadly attack under certain circumstances. For one, he may not be the aggressor. Moreover, he must believe his force is necessary. Furthermore, that belief must be reasonable. In addition, the person must be facing imminent and unlawful force.
Notably, the force the person uses need not be actually necessary. It need only appear so to a reasonable person. Under common law, a person may use deadly force to defend himself from a deadly attack under the same circumstances as for a non-deadly attack except that a person may not use deadly force if non-deadly force would suffice.

====Other justifications====
Other justifications include [[Rights_of_self-defense#Defense_of_others|defense of others]], [[defense of property]], law enforcement, and [[necessity (criminal law)|necessity]].

===Excuse===
Excuse defenses are also full defenses. However, society is not saying the actor did nothing wrong, only that it will not punish him under the circumstances. Intoxication can serve as a defense, with the law distinguishing between how  [[intoxication defense|voluntary and involuntary intoxication]] can serve as defenses.  Mistake is another defense and can be a [[Mistake (criminal law)|mistake of fact]] or a [[mistake of law]].  Other excuses include [[duress]] and [[Insanity defense|insanity]].

==Crimes==


===Homicide===
Only a human being can commit a homicide (as opposed to other legal persons, such as corporations). He does so when unlawfully he kills another human being. The two categories of homicide are murder and manslaughter.

A person who accidentally causes a fatal car accident because they lost control on black ice and killed a child is still considered to have committed "homicide," but is not punishable as long as it is proven that it was a truly, tragic accidental car wreck. While homicide is a word carrying a criminal connotation to the layperson, from a legal standpoint it is merely the "unlawful killing of another human being" and may not be punishable.

====Murder====
{{main|Murder (United States law)}}
A human being commits murder when he commits a homicide with malice aforethought, an "endangering state of mind."  There are four ways to satisfy the element of malice. One is an intent to kill and is the only form of express malice. The remaining ways are implied malice. One is an intent to inflict great bodily harm. A third is a reckless disregard for the value of human life, sometimes called depraved heart. The last only applies when someone dies during the commission or attempted commission of a felony. It is often called the [[felony murder rule]] and only requires the person to intend to commit the underlying felony.

Degrees of murder did not exist under common law. Most states have statutorily created at least two degrees of murder. Usually, a person only commits first-degree murder when he has express malice. If he has any other type of malice, he usually commits second-degree murder. American law reformed old world, common law practices during the ages of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] where even petty thieves were executed. American law generally categorizes the level of punishment and created lesser sentences, as opposed to the common law "one size fits all," hence the first, second, third and fourth degree murder with different level of punishment. (See voluntary manslaughter)

=====First-degree murder=====
First degree murder is proven when malice aforethought accompanies "willful, deliberate and premediation" of the criminal homicide. Since it is the harshest degree of murder in terms of sentencing and societal punishment, a first degree murder must be especially premediated. Premeditation is the time and capacity to appreciate the enormity of the evil imposed. It involves weighing the pros and cons of one's own actions, and allowing one to think calmly, rationally and thoughtfully. A planned event, with a design to maliciously murder another human being, such as a gang member planning a contract murder or a serial killer outlining the steps to kidnapping his next victim, are committing premeditated acts when, if caught and charged, usually are proven to have committed murder in the first degree.

=====Second-degree murder=====
Second degree murder, however, initiated by any other crime which satisfies the general malice aforethought whereas "malice is merely implied."

The MPC does not categorize murder by degrees.

====Voluntary manslaughter====
[[Voluntary manslaughter]] is the lesser charge of homicide, lesser than murder, for a reason that has come down by American law taken from the felony murder rule doctrine of the common law. American society has come to understand how a loss of self-control, brought about through emotional states, can push a person toward murder when it is not rationally intended. Since Henry the Eighth, common law practices were harsh whereas petty thieves were executed, as well as criminals whose motives were understood as emotionally challenging to maintain self-control. Voluntary manslaughter, although punishable, is an intentional, malicious form of homicide that involves certain elements to justify this lesser charge.

The "Heat of Passion" and "Cooling off Period" are subjective justifications that are argued in court, by attorneys, based on circumstantial evidence and establishment of motives where proof of a crime may not be fully ascertained. The ideas that a person, whom upon walking into his bedroom, observes his wife having sex with another male (his lifelong rival), reacts harshly, grabs a nearby gun, and within a matter of minutes, kills both of them, is less punishable than other forms of deliberate, premeditated and willful acts of calculated murder. A person is still "hot," the heat of passion is so great that reason is dismissed and primal aggression takes over, but it was never the natural intention of the person ever—with no evidence of ever having marital problems or the like. Because he or she walked in on his partner's infidelity and kills both of them within minutes, he or she has no chance to cool off. However, the heat of passion and cooling are subjective factors. 

According to the law, a murder charge can become a voluntary manslaughter charge if there is proof of "legally adequate provocation," the objective test. This truly objective standard combines heat of passion and cooling off to determine them from the facts of a case. The question is, "Does the defendant have legally adequate provocation to have lost control?" In situations of infidelity described above, he does, according to America's general interpretation. (Facts of a particular case may override some of that matter, however). Insulting words alone cannot justify legally adequate provocation. 

Think about reasonably adequate provocation in terms of a stressful trigger to a loss of self-control. The law says insulting words, or words alone, cannot justify a trigger of criminal homicide. Your lover cannot call you a name, thereby making you justified in killing them. The legally adequate provocation must go beyond insulting words to events, situations and circumstances that surprise the defendant and trigger them to lose any sort of reasonableness without time to think through the consequences nor weigh the pros and cons. In this way, a court may establish a defendant, originally charged with second degree murder, to have been legally adequately provoked to commit the unlawful act of killing of another human being making his crime less punishable, but still punishable. 

Voluntary manslaughter results in a lesser charge than murder, but more than involuntary manslaughter.

====Involuntary manslaughter====
Although [[Involuntary manslaughter]] is unintentional, the law requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of some form of malfeasance or misfeasance. Malfeasance is considered to be any dangerous, unlawful act (felony), misfeasance includes any act, even lawful, that is criminally negligent (misdemeanor).

===Rape===
{{main|Rape in the United States}}
American [[rape]] law has transitioned common law practices which grew out of a male centric legal interpretation to the feministic view it has today. A woman once had to prove absolute resistance against her aggressor, and rape reformation laws in America did away with the Hale Warning, corrorborating evidence, and the early outcry doctrine and instead focused rape law reform onto the aggressive, coercive nature of the "rapist." Marital rape law once required "forcible, unlawful and carnal knowledge," and common law once believed husbands cannot rape their wives, so these incidents, if reported at all, were never charged. Women in America have reported more rape with these times, however, only 12% of rapes are currently reported nationally out of the thousands of offenses that occur.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Theft===

====Larceny====
{{Empty section|date=December 2011|section=}}

====Robbery====
Robbery at common law was the trespassory taking of the property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property by means of force or fear.

[[Robbery#United_States|Robbery]] charges result in substantial sentences which may be up to ten years with parole. Robbery with a deadly weapon increases this sentence and depends on the present ability of the defendant during the commission of the ''res gestae'', or "the thing that happened". The precise language of this charge must be carefully reasoned to a jury panel by a trial court judge. In order for a taking to be "felonious", proof must exist beyond the defendant's ''animus firandi'', or "evil in the heart". In other words, robbery is a charge reliant on the notion of possession of property of another and the force or fear used to accomplish the transfer of possession. According to the legal standard, a sleeping man cannot be aware that his property is being stolen. Therefore, a thief cannot be charged with robbery based on the force or fear prior to the incident requirement. 

The transfer of property cannot be a voluntary transaction. In looking at property holding, three major distinctions are made in cases where a charge of robbery is not inexplicably obvious. "Mere custody," entitlement, and possession are the three levels of property holding and are specifically important to the precise language of the legal interpretation of what constitutes a robbery. If a person has mere custody of an object belonging to another, he or she is borrowing the object in question. If a citizen loans his vehicle to an associate to go to the grocery store, the associate must return the vehicle. If one purchases a new CD, the purchaser is entitled to the property because it becomes your own under your ownership. 

Possession, however, is acquiring an object of another without being entitled to it or allowed to possess it. A person charged with a robbery may have reasonably believed he or she owned the iPod, although they may have been incorrect. Possession, in terms of the legal interpretation of robbery, is 9/10 of the law.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Possession, to charge robbery, must be a transfer of property acquired through force or fear. That is, a defendant must create fear through force in order to achieve the possession of the object or property in question, otherwise they may have committed another crime. A person who threatens another with future violence cannot be charged with robbery, because they did not use "force or fear", and insulting words alone cannot allow somebody to be entitled to self-defense. Therefore, a person who holds up victim with a deadly weapon, with or without present ability (bullets in the weapon that is charged and fails to meet its target-assault), and takes possession of a book the victim is holding, is committing robbery according to the law.

The force or fear established by the defendant must precede the transfer of possession of the object in question. This can be said, also, as the transfer of possession must be acquired through the use of force or fear as the tool of attaining such goods in order to achieve all aspects of the legal doctrine imposed, "the felonious taking."

[[File:Disposablediaper.JPG|thumb|Inside of a disposable baby diaper with resealable tapes and elasticated leg cuffs]]
[[File:Cloth diaper3.jpg|right|thumb|Different kinds of outer diapers]]

A '''diaper''' ([[American English]]) or a '''nappy''' ([[Australian English]] and [[British English]]) is a type of underwear that allows the wearer to [[defecate]] or [[urinate]] without the use of a [[toilet]], by absorbing or containing waste products to prevent soiling of outer clothing or the external environment. When diapers become soiled, they require changing, generally by a second person such as a parent or caregiver. Failure to change a diaper on a sufficiently regular basis can result in [[Irritant diaper dermatitis|skin problems]] around the area covered by the diaper.

Diapers are made of [[textile|cloth]] or synthetic [[disposable]] materials. Cloth diapers are composed of layers of fabric such as [[cotton]], hemp, bamboo, microfiber, or even plastic fibers such as [[Polylactic acid|PLA]] or [[Polyurethane|PU]], and can be washed and reused multiple times. Disposable diapers contain absorbent chemicals and are thrown away after use.

Diapers are primarily worn by [[infants]], [[toddlers]] who are not yet [[toilet training|potty trained]], and by [[children]] who experience [[Nocturnal enuresis|bedwetting]]. They are also [[Adult diaper|used by adults]] with [[urinary incontinence|incontinence]], in certain circumstances where access to a toilet is unavailable or for [[diaper fetishism|psychological reasons]]. These can include [[old age|those of advanced age]], patients bed-bound in a hospital, individuals with certain types of physical or [[mental disorder|mental]] [[disability]], [[Diaper fetishism|diaper fetishists]], and people working in extreme conditions, such as [[astronaut]]s. It is not uncommon for people to wear diapers under [[dry suit]]s. 

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="''Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper''"|source=—One of the earliest known uses of the word in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''.&lt;ref name=Shakespeare&gt;{{cite web |url=http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?action=search&amp;resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=Diaper |title=Diaper |work=Webster's Dictionary |publisher=The University of Chicago Department of Romance Languages and Literature |accessdate=2 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525222029/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?action=search&amp;resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=Diaper |archive-date=May 25, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Middle English]] word ''diaper'' originally referred to a type of cloth rather than the use thereof; "diaper" was the term for a pattern of repeated,  rhombic shapes, and later came to describe a white cotton or linen fabric with this pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50063239?query_type=word&amp;queryword=diaper&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=7XBH-TjGw7R-11027&amp;hilite=50063239 Oxford English Dictionary – "Diaper"] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first cloth diapers consisted of a specific type of soft tissue sheet, cut into geometric shapes. This type of pattern was called [[diapering]] and eventually gave its name to the cloth used to make diapers and then to the diaper itself, which was traced back to 1590s England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=diaper |title=Diaper |publisher=eytomonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage stuck in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] following the [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonization of North America]], but in the [[United Kingdom]] the word "nappy" took its place. Most sources believe ''nappy'' is a diminutive form of the word [[napkin]], which itself was originally a diminutive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00321105?query_type=word&amp;queryword=nappy&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;search_id=7XBH-OkOsBx-11004&amp;result_place=1 |title=Nappy |publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
[[File:Unangenehme Vaterpflichten.JPG|thumb|upright|''Unpleasant duties'' (1631) by [[Adriaen Brouwer]], depicting the changing of a diaper]]
In the 19th century, the modern diaper began to take shape and mothers in many parts of the world used cotton material, held in place with a fastening—eventually the [[safety pin]]. Cloth diapers in the United States were first mass-produced in 1887 by Maria Allen. In the UK, nappies were made out of [[terry towelling]], often with an inner lining made out of soft [[muslin]].

Here is an extract from 'The Modern Home Doctor' written by physicians in the UK in 1935.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nice old, soft bits of good Turkish towelling, properly washed, will make the softest of diaper coverings, inside which specially absorbent napkins (diapers), see below at 1A, soft, light, and easily washed, are contained. These should rarely be soiled once regular habits have been inculcated, especially during the night period in which it is most important to prevent habit formation&lt;br /&gt;
1A -(squares of butter muslin or Harrington's packed rolls of "mutton cloth" in packets, sold for polishing motor-cars, would do equally well and are very cheap and soft)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wool pants, or, once available, [[rubber pants]], were sometimes used over the cloth diaper to prevent leakage. Doctors believed that rubber pants were harmful because they thought the rubber acted as a [[poultice]] and damaged the skin of infants.{{citation needed|reason=Which doctors, how many doctors, what is the source of this claim?|date=June 2012}} The constant problem to be overcome was diaper rash, and the infection thereof. The concern was that lack of air circulation would worsen this condition. While lack of air circulation is a factor, it was later found that poor hygiene involving inefficiently washed diapers and infrequent changes of diapers, along with allowing the baby to lie for prolonged periods of time with fecal matter in contact with the skin, were the two main causes of these problems.{{citation needed|reason=What is the source of this medical conclusion?|date=June 2012}}

In the 20th century, the disposable diaper was conceived. In the 1930s, Robinsons of Chesterfield had what were labeled "Destroyable Babies Napkins" listed in their catalogue for the wholesale market.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Peter White (2000) [http://www.paddi.org.uk/From-the-Bottom-Up.php From Pillboxes to Bandages... ...and Back Again. The Robinson Story 1839–2000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512031036/http://www.paddi.org.uk/From-the-Bottom-Up.php |date=May 12, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, [[Hugo Drangel]] of the Swedish paper company [[Pauliström]] suggested a conceptual design which would entail the placing of sheets of paper tissue (cellulose wadding) inside the cloth diaper and rubber pants. However, cellulose wadding was rough against the skin and crumbled into balls when exposed to moisture.

In 1946, [[Marion Donovan]] used a shower curtain from her bathroom to create the "Boater", a [[Plastic pants|plastic cover]] to be donned outside a diaper. First sold in 1949 at Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship store in New York City, patents were later issued in 1951 to Donovan, who later sold the rights to the waterproof diaper for $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marion Donovan, 81, Solver Of the Damp-Diaper Problem |publisher=New York City Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/18/business/marion-donovan-81-solver-of-the-damp-diaper-problem.html |date=November 18, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Donovan also designed a paper disposable diaper, but was unsuccessful in marketing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi2464.htm|title=No. 2464: Engineering Diapers|work=uh.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1947, Scottish housewife [[Valerie Hunter Gordon]] started developing and making Paddi, a 2-part system consisting of a disposable pad (made of cellulose wadding covered with cotton wool) worn inside an adjustable plastic garment with press-studs/snaps. Initially, she used old parachutes for the garment. She applied for the patent in April 1948, and it was granted for the UK in October 1949.  Initially, the big manufacturers were unable to see the commercial possibilities of disposable nappies. In 1948, Gordon made over 400 Paddis herself using her sewing machine at the kitchen table. Her husband had unsuccessfully approached several companies for help until he had a chance meeting with Sir Robert Robinson at a business dinner. In November 1949 Valerie Gordon signed a contract with Robinsons of Chesterfield who then went into full production. In 1950, [[Boots UK]] agreed to sell Paddi in all their branches. In 1951 the Paddi patent was granted for the US and worldwide. Shortly after that, Playtex and several other large international companies tried unsuccessfully to buy out Paddi from Robinsons. Paddi was very successful for many years until the advent of 'all in one' diapers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/10/20/valerie-hunter-gordon-inventor-of-the-disposable-nappy--obituary/ Daily Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more information go to http://www.paddi.org.uk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512011713/http://www.paddi.org.uk/ |date=May 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden, Hugo Drangel's daughter [[Lil Karhola Wettergren]], in 1956 elaborated her father's original idea, by adding a garment (again making a 2-part system like Paddi). However she met the same problem, with the purchasing managers, declaring they would never allow their wives to "put paper on their children."&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:Pauliström|Pauliström Mill History]]{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Second World War, mothers increasingly wanted freedom from washing diapers so that they could work and travel, causing an increasing demand for disposable diapers.{{citation needed|reason=What is the source for this historical claim?|date=June 2012}}

During the 1950s, companies such as Johnson and Johnson, Kendall, Parke-Davis, Playtex, and Molnlycke entered the disposable diaper market, and in 1956, Procter &amp; Gamble began researching disposable diapers. [[Victor Mills]], along with his project group including William Dehaas (both men who worked for the company) invented what would be trademarked "Pampers". Although Pampers were conceptualized in 1959, the diapers themselves were not launched into the market until 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Politics of Diapers|url=http://mothering.com/green-living/politics-diapers|accessdate=March 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pampers]] now accounts for more than $10 billion in annual revenue at [[Procter &amp; Gamble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pampers: The Birth of P&amp;G's First 10-Billion-Dollar Brand|url=http://news.pg.com/blog/10-billion-dollar-brand/pampers-birth-pgs-first-10-billion-dollar-brand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next few decades, the disposable diaper industry boomed and the competition between Procter &amp; Gamble's Pampers and [[Kimberly Clark]]'s Huggies resulted in lower prices and drastic changes to diaper design. Several improvements were made, such as the use of double gussets to improve diaper fit and containment. As stated in Procter &amp; Gamble's initial 1973 patent for the use of double gussets in a diaper, "The double gusset folded areas tend to readily conform to the thigh portions of the leg of the infant. This allows quick and easy fitting and provides a snug and comfortable diaper fit that will neither bind nor wad on the infant…as a result of this snugger fit obtained because of this fold configuration, the diaper is less likely to leak or, in other words, its containment characteristics are greatly enhanced."&lt;ref name="Double Gussets diaper patent"&gt;Mario S Marsan.

== Types ==

=== Disposable ===
[[File:Baby diaper.jpg|thumb|right|160px|A baby wearing a disposable diaper]]
The first disposable diaper was invented in 1946 by [[Marion Donovan]], a professional-turned-housewife who wanted to ensure her children's cloth diapers remained dry while they slept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | last = Blattman | first = Elissa | title = "Three Every-day Items Invented by Women" | publisher = National Women's History Museum | year = 2013 | url = https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/three-every-day-items-invented-women}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donovan patented her design (called 
'Boaters') in 1951. She also invented the first paper diapers, but executives did not invest in this idea and it was consequently scrapped for over ten years, until Procter &amp; Gamble used Donovan's design ideas to create [[Pampers]].

Another diaper design was created by Valerie Hunter Gordon (née de Ferranti), and patented in 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Paddi|publisher=paddi.org.uk|url=http://www.paddi.org.uk/Paddi-History.php|accessdate=August 1, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404192409/http://www.paddi.org.uk/Paddi-History.php|archivedate=April 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Valerie Hunter Gordon]] (née de Ferranti),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC – Radio4|title=Home truth – Nappy days|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hometruths/20050228_nappy_inventor.shtml|accessdate=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; granddaughter of inventor [[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti]].

Ever since their introduction several decades ago, product innovations include the use of [[superabsorbent polymer]]s, resealable tapes, and [[Elastomer|elasticised]] waist bands. They are now much thinner and much more absorbent. The product range has more recently been extended into children's toilet training phase with the introduction of training pants and pant diapers, which are now undergarments.

Modern disposable baby diapers and incontinence products have a layered construction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How disposable diaper is made|publisher=How Products Are Made|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-3/Disposable-Diaper.html|accessdate=March 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows the transfer and distribution of urine to an absorbent core structure where it is locked in. Basic layers are an outer shell of breathable [[polyethylene]] film or a nonwoven and film composite which prevents wetness and soil transfer, an inner absorbent layer of a mixture of [[air-laid paper]] and [[superabsorbent polymer]]s for wetness, and a layer nearest the skin of [[Nonwoven fabric|nonwoven material]] with a distribution layer directly beneath which will transfer wetness to the absorbent layer.

Other common features of disposable diapers include one or more pairs of either adhesive or mechanical fastening tapes to keep the diaper securely fastened. Some diapers have tapes which are refastenable to allow adjusting of fit or reapplication after inspection. Elasticized fabric single and double [[gusset]]s around the leg and waist areas aid in fitting and in containing urine or stool which has not been absorbed. Some diapers lines now commonly include [[wetness indicator]]s, in which a chemical included in the fabric of the diaper changes color in the presence of moisture to alert the carer or user that the diaper is wet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are the components used on a typical disposable diaper|publisher=Diaper Industry Source|url=http://www.disposablediaper.net/faq.asp?1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723094916/http://www.disposablediaper.net/faq.asp?1 |archivedate=July 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A disposable diaper may also include an inner fabric designed to hold moisture against the skin for a brief period before absorption to alert a toilet training or bedwetting user that they have urinated. Most materials in the diaper are held together with the use of a [[hot-melt adhesive]], which is applied in spray form or multi lines, an elastic hot melt is also used to help with pad integrity when the diaper is wet.

Some disposable diapers include fragrance, lotions or [[essential oils]] in order to help mask the scent of a soiled diaper, or to protect the skin. Care of disposable diapers is minimal, and primarily consists of keeping them in a dry place before use, with proper disposal in a garbage receptacle upon soiling. Stool is supposed to be deposited in the toilet, but is generally put in the garbage with the rest of the diaper.

=== Cloth diaper ===
{{Main article|Cloth diaper}}
[[File:Cloth diaper.jpg|right|thumb|Cloth diaper filled with extra cloth]]
[[File:Rotchi.jpg|right|thumb|Baby with cloth diaper]]
Cloth diapers are reusable and can be made from natural fibers, synthetic materials, or a combination of both.&lt;ref name="ip.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Improved containment and convenience in a double gusset cloth diaper: Method of manufacture|url=http://www.ip.com/IPCOM/000209419|date=August 4, 2011|author=Leah S. Leverich}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often made from industrial [[cotton]] which may be [[bleach]]ed white or left the fiber's natural color. Other natural fiber cloth materials include [[wool]], [[bamboo]], and unbleached [[hemp]]. Man-made materials such as an internal absorbent layer of [[microfiber]] toweling or an external waterproof layer of [[polyurethane laminate]] (PUL) may be used. [[Polyester]] fleece and faux [[suedecloth]] are often used inside cloth diapers as a "stay-dry" [[wicking]] liner because of the non-absorbent properties of those synthetic fibers.

[[File:Safediaperclip.jpg|right|thumb|Safe Diaper Clip from the mid-1960s]]
Traditionally, cloth diapers consisted of a folded square or rectangle of cloth, fastened with [[safety pin]]s. Today, most cloth diapers are fastened with hook and loop tape (velcro) or snaps.

Modern cloth diapers come in a host of shapes, including preformed cloth diapers, all-in-one diapers with waterproof exteriors, fitted diaper with covers and pocket or "stuffable" diapers, which consist of a water-resistant outer shell sewn with an opening for insertion of absorbent material inserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cloth Diapering|url=http://www.naturalfamilyonline.com/5-diap/48-cloth-diapers-simple.htm|accessdate=March 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330001541/http://www.naturalfamilyonline.com/5-diap/48-cloth-diapers-simple.htm|archive-date=March 30, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many design features of modern cloth diapers have followed directly from innovations initially developed in disposable diapers, such as the use of the hour glass shape, materials to separate moisture from skin and the use of double gussets, or an inner elastic band for better fit and containment of waste material.&lt;ref name="ip.com" /&gt; Several cloth diaper brands use variations of [[Procter &amp; Gamble]]'s original 1973 patent use of a double gusset in [[Pampers]].&lt;ref name="Double Gussets diaper patent" /&gt;

The age at which children should cease regularly wearing diapers and [[toilet training]] should begin is a subject of debate. Proponents of [[baby-led potty training]] and [[Elimination Communication]] argue that potty training can begin at birth with multiple benefits, with diapers only used as a back up. Keeping children in diapers beyond infancy can be controversial, with family psychologist [[John Rosemond]] claiming it is a "slap to the intelligence of a human being that one would allow baby to continue soiling and wetting himself past age two."&lt;ref name=Delayed&gt;[http://www.dy-dee.com/Benefits_of_Cloth/Skin_Care/Toilet_Training_Brazelton/toilet_training_brazelton.html Delayed Toilet Training Issues].

Most children no longer wear diapers when past two to four years of age, depending on culture, diaper type, parental habits, and the child's personality.&lt;ref&gt;A. Honig "[http://www.scholastic.com/earlylearner/experts/behavior/0_2_toiletstubborn.htm Toilet Training Stubbornness]," Scholastic Parent and Child&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is becoming increasingly common for children as old as five to still be wearing diapers because of their parents' neglect or the child's opposition to toilet training.  This can pose a number of problems if the child is sent to school wearing diapers, including teasing from classmates and health issues resulting from soiled diapers.  Teachers' groups—who are attributing the epidemic to an increase in full-time day care use—are requesting that diapered children be banned from the classroom.{{citation needed|reason=What is the source for this claim about the opinion of teachers?|date=June 2012}}  The disposable diaper industry has been accused of encouraging this trend by manufacturing diapers in increasingly larger sizes.  "[S]uper-comfortable diapers" have also been criticized; the advanced technology in modern diapers wick wetness away from skin, leaving the child oblivious to their accident and when they need to go to the toilet.  Paediatric nurse June Rogers claims that the attitude of parents plays a major role in the problem, and that toilet training is simply not a priority for many of them.&lt;ref name=NappySchool&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/kids-wear-nappies-to-school/story-e6freon6-1111116825456|title=Kids at school in nappies|author=Davies, Hannah |date=June 5, 2008|publisher=[[The Courier-Mail]]|accessdate=June 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NappySchool2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bambamboos.com/blogs/news/16642205-how-old-is-too-old-for-a-child-to-wear-diapers|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628191213/http://www.bambamboos.com/blogs/news/16642205-how-old-is-too-old-for-a-child-to-wear-diapers |archivedate=June 28, 2009|title=Parents sending kids to school in nappies|author=Hannah Davies|date=June 5, 2008|publisher=[[The Courier-Mail]]|accessdate=June 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Training pants ====
{{Main article|Training pants}}

Manufacturers have designed "training pants" which bridge the gap between baby diapers and normal underwear during the toilet training process.  These are similar to infant diapers in construction but they can be put on like normal underwear.  Training pants are available for children who experience [[enuresis]].

=== Adults ===
[[File:Adult diapers in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|Adult diapers may be worn for urinary and fecal incontinence.]]
{{Main article|Adult diaper}}
Although most commonly worn by and associated with babies and children, diapers are also worn by adults for a variety of reasons. In the medical community, they are usually referred to as "adult absorbent briefs" rather than diapers, which are associated with children and may have a negative connotation. The usage of adult diapers can be a source of embarrassment,&lt;ref name=WYGGYGG&gt;{{cite web|last=Stack |first=Jennie Borodko |title=When You've Gotta Go, You've Gotta Go |publisher=[[Muscular Dystrophy Association]] |date=February 2001 |url=https://thediaperrash.com/alternative-ways-for-adults-to-pee/|accessdate=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and products are often marketed under euphemisms such as incontinence pads.  The most common adult users of diapers are those with medical conditions which cause them to experience [[urinary incontinence|urinary]] like bed wetting or [[fecal incontinence]], or those who are bedridden or otherwise limited in their mobility.

=== Animals ===
Diapers and diaperlike products are sometimes used on [[pet]]s, [[animal testing|laboratory animal]]s, or [[working animal]]s. This is often due to the animal not being [[housebroken]], or for older, sick, or injured pets who have become incontinent. In some cases, these are simply baby diapers with holes cut for the tails to fit through. In other cases, they are diaperlike waste collection devices.

The diapers used on primates, canines, etc. are much like the diapers used by humans. The diapers used on equines are intended to catch excretions, as opposed to absorbing them.

In 2002, the [[Vienna]] city council proposed that horses be made to wear diapers to prevent them from defecating in the street.  This caused controversy amongst animal rights groups, who claimed that wearing diapers would be uncomfortable for the animals.  The campaigners protested by lining the streets wearing diapers themselves, which spelled out the message "Stop pooh bags".&lt;ref name=Horses1&gt;{{cite news|title=Row as horses told to wear nappies|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/sport/newsid_2271000/2271844.stm|date=September 20, 2002|accessdate=February 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Kenya]]n town of [[Limuru]], donkeys were also diapered at the council's behest.&lt;ref name=Donkey&gt;{{cite news|title=Anger at Kenya donkey nappy plan|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6902309.stm|date=July 17, 2007|accessdate=February 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar scheme in [[Blackpool]] ordered that horses be fitted with rubber and plastic diapers to stop them littering the promenade with dung.

As of 2018, name-brand, mid-range disposable diapers in the U.S., such as Huggies and Pampers, were sold at an average cost of approximately $0.20–0.30 each, and their manufacturers earned about two cents in profit from each diaper sold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Premium brands had eco-friendly features, and sold for approximately twice that price.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Generic disposable diapers cost less per diaper, at an average price of $0.15 each, and the typical manufacturer's profit was about one cent per diaper.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, the low-cost diapers needed to be changed more frequently, so the total cost savings was limited, as the lower cost per diaper was offset by the need to buy more diapers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[environmental impact of cloth]] as compared to disposable diapers has been studied several times. In one cradle-to-grave study sponsored by the National Association of Diaper Services (NADS) and conducted by Carl Lehrburger and colleagues, results found that disposable diapers produce seven times more [[solid waste]] when discarded and three times more waste in the manufacturing process. In addition, effluents from the plastic, pulp, and [[pulp and paper industry|paper industries]] are far more hazardous than those from the [[cotton]]-growing and -manufacturing processes. Single-use diapers [[water consumption|consume less water]] than reusables laundered at home, but more than those sent to a commercial diaper service.  Washing cloth diapers at home uses 50 to 70 gallons (approx. 189 to 264 litres) of water every three days, which is roughly equivalent to flushing the toilet 15 times a day, unless the user has a high-efficiency washing machine. An average diaper service puts its diapers through an average of 13 water changes, but uses less water and [[energy use|energy]] per diaper than one [[laundry]] load at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carl Lehrburger|author2=C.

In October 2008, "An updated lifecycle assessment study for disposable and reusable nappies" by the UK Environment Agency and [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] stated that reusable diapers can cause significantly less (up to 40 per cent) or significantly more damage to the environment than disposable ones, depending mostly on how parents wash and dry them. The "baseline scenario" showed that the difference in green-house emissions was insignificant (in fact, disposables even scored slightly better). However, much better results (emission cuts of up to 40 per cent) could be achieved by using reusable diapers more rationally. "The report shows that, in contrast to the use of disposable nappies, it is consumers' behaviour after purchase that determines most of the impacts from reusable nappies. Cloth nappy users can reduce their environmental impacts by:
* Line drying outside whenever possible
* Tumble drying as little as possible
* When replacing appliances, choosing more energy efficient appliances (A+ rated machines [according to the [[European Union|EU]] environmental rating] are preferred)
* Not washing above {{convert|60|C}}
* Washing fuller loads
* Using [[baby-led potty training]] techniques to reduce number of soiled nappies.
* Reusing nappies on other children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=WR0705_7589_FRP.pdf |title=The UK Environment Agency / DEFRA study |publisher=randd.defra.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are variations in the care of cloth diapers that can account for different measures of environmental impact.  For example, using a cloth diaper laundering service involves additional pollution from the vehicle that picks up and drops off deliveries.  Yet such a service uses less water per diaper in the laundering process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=WR0705_7589_FRP.pdf |title=Science and Research Projects |publisher=randd.defra.gov.uk |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some people who launder cloth diapers at home wash each load twice, considering the first wash a "prewash", and thus doubling the energy and water usage from laundering.  Cloth diapers are most commonly made of cotton, which is generally considered an environmentally wasteful crop to grow. "Conventional cotton is one of the most chemically-dependent crops, sucking up 10% of all agricultural chemicals and 25% of [[insecticide]]s on 3% of our arable land; that's more than any other crop per unit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/08/green-basics-organic-cotton.php Green Basics: Organic Cotton], treehugger.com&lt;/ref&gt;  This effect can be mitigated by using other materials, such as bamboo and hemp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windeln im Test – Unabhängiges Vergleichsportal|url=http://windeln-tests.de/|publisher=www.windeln-tests.de|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect to consider when choosing between disposable diapers and cloth diapers is cost.  It is estimated that an average baby will use from $1,500 to $2,000 or more in disposable diapers before being potty-trained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cost of washing and drying diapers must also be considered.  The basic set, if one-sized, can last from birth to potty-training.

Another factor in reusable cloth diaper impact is the ability to re-use the diapers for subsequent children or sell them on. These factors can alleviate the environmental and financial impact from manufacture, sale and use of brand-new reusable diapers.

'''''Freedom Planet''''' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[platform game|platform]] video game developed and published by GalaxyTrail, a studio set up by designer Stephen DiDuro. The player controls one of three [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animal protagonists: the dragon Lilac, the [[wildcat]] Carol, or the [[basset hound]] Milla. Aided by the duck-like Torque, the player attempts to defeat Lord Brevon, who plans to conquer the galaxy. While the game focuses on fast-paced platforming, its levels are interspersed with slower [[action video game|action]] scenes.

''Freedom Planet'' began development as a ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[fangame]], but DiDuro lost interest in creating a [[derivative work]] and reconceived the project as his own [[intellectual property]]. He visited the website [[DeviantArt]] to recruit artist Ziyo Ling, who replaced the existing cast of characters with her own. Lilac, originally a [[hedgehog]], became a dragon; antagonist [[Doctor Eggman]] was replaced by Brevon; and the ''Sonic'' series' [[Sonic the Hedgehog#Common features|ring]]-based [[health (gaming)|health]] system was abandoned. Further changes were suggested by fans and incorporated throughout development. ''Freedom Planet'' was developed in Denmark and the United States and its art direction has [[East Asia]]n influences: its [[Environment artist|background visuals]] were inspired by medieval [[Chinese art]], and the game's title is written in [[katakana]].

The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], first as a demo in August 2012, then, after a successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign, as a full game via [[Steam (software)|Steam]] in July 2014. The game was later released on the [[Wii U]] in October 2015, on the [[PlayStation 4]] in 2017, and on the [[Nintendo Switch]] in August 2018. ''Freedom Planet'' has been widely compared to the early ''Sonic'' games. Critics praised its gameplay, aesthetics, and balance of ''Sonic'' elements with original content, but were mixed on its pacing and length. A sequel, ''[[Freedom Planet 2]]'', will be released in 2019.

''Freedom Planet'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[platform game|platform]] and [[action game|action]] game featuring anthropomorphized animal characters and 16-bit style graphics mimicking the look of games released for the [[Sega Genesis]], particularly the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series.&lt;ref name="borrows"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/platformer-freedom-planet-borrows-from-the-sega-genesis-greats-278484.phtml|publisher=[[Destructoid]]|last=Devore|first=Jordan|date=July 22, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2014|title=Platformer Freedom Planet borrows from the Sega Genesis greats|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729154141/http://www.destructoid.com/platformer-freedom-planet-borrows-from-the-sega-genesis-greats-278484.phtml|archivedate=July 29, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurogamer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku"/&gt;&lt;ref name="destructoid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indiegames"/&gt; The game puts players in the role of one of the available playable characters as they traverse each level, fighting enemies and obstacles before facing a [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end. Players have a health meter, which can be replenished by collecting red leaves, and a regenerative energy meter used to perform each character's unique special moves. Players can earn [[1-up|extra lives]] by collecting blue crystals found throughout the level, or by rescuing creatures trapped in cages. Players can also obtain various types of shields, some of which often bonus attributes such as invulnerabilty to fire or the ability to breathe underwater, and invincibility power-ups. Cards are hidden through the levels, which unlock bonus content such as music and concept art, and bonus tokens which allows access to a bonus game at the end of the level.&lt;ref name="interview2electricboogaloo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="game"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Freedom Planet|date=July 21, 2014|publisher=GalaxyTrail|developer=GalaxyTrail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Freedom Planet Running Boss.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Lilac fights one of the game's bosses, Serpentine, while Carol assists her with attacks and Milla with extra health.]]

The game has three playable characters that are the protagonists: Lilac, Carol, and Milla. Each character has Melee attacks and a unique array of moves which allow them to traverse the environment in different ways. Lilac can perform a double-jump attack and can launch herself into an air dash, allowing her to bounce off walls and reach high areas. Carol is able to curl into a spin-attack while running and can climb up walls. By picking up gas canisters, Carol can bring out her motorcycle, which can double-jump and ride up vertical walls. Milla can throw gelatinous cubes and put up an offensive shield, combining the two to perform a Shield Blast, and flap her ears to reach high areas.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="4gamer"/&gt;

Players can play through the main game in one of two ways; Adventure, which tells the game's story through the perspective of a chosen character, and Classic, in which the levels are played in order without any story cutscenes. Time Attack mode allows the player to attempt to complete levels in the quickest time possible.&lt;ref name="hardcore" /&gt;

==Plot==
The game begins as Sash Lilac and Carol Tea—an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dragon and [[wildcat]] —rescue a duck-billed creature named Torque after his [[spacecraft]] crash lands. At Torque's request, the three set out to protect a powerful relic called the Kingdom Stone. This involves them in a conflict between three nations on their planet: Shuigang, a country militarized by its new king, Dail; Shang Mu, led by the wealth-obsessed Mayor Zao ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|aʊ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʒ|aʊ}}); and Shang Tu, whose Royal Magister is unprepared for war.&lt;ref name="chars"/&gt; Lilac and Carol rush to the Kingdom Stone's shrine but are waylaid by the Shang Tu officers General Gong and Neera Li, who doubt that the Stone is threatened. The protagonists arrive just as the Stone is stolen by Spade, a henchman of Zao. After the shrine collapses, Carol is separated from Lilac and pinned by rubble, but she is saved by the timid [[basset hound]] Milla ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|iː|l|ə}}) Basset.

[[File:Freedom Planet Cutscene.png|thumb|left|300px|In this cutscene, Gong and Neera are initially unimpressed with Carol's and Lilac's claims that the Kingdom Stone was stolen.]]

That night, Torque tells Lilac, Carol, and Milla that he is an alien sent to apprehend the intergalactic warlord Arktivus Brevon, whose spacecraft wrecked on the planet. Brevon has invaded Shuigang, murdered its king, and [[Mind control|brainwashed]] Dail to be his servant. He intends to steal the Stone to power his ship. The protagonists decide to reclaim the Stone from Zao, but they are accosted en route by Spade and by Brevon's assistant Serpentine. The delays give Dail and Brevon's forces time to steal the relic. Afterwards, Zao sends the protagonists as emissaries to Shang Tu to discuss an alliance against Shuigang. They are detained by the Magister upon their arrival, as Neera blames them for the Stone's original disappearance. Torque is acquitted when Lilac falsely pleads guilty. She, Carol, and Milla quickly break out of jail to reunite with Torque, only to see him captured by Brevon and Serpentine.

Carol quarrels with Lilac and storms off. Lilac sends Milla to find her and then goes to save Torque from Brevon's nearby base, but she is captured and tortured by Brevon. Meanwhile, Carol and Milla ally with Spade to storm the base, where they rescue Torque and Lilac. They are all separated in the ensuing conflict. Neera finds Lilac, arrests her, and brings her back to Shang Tu, where the Magister determines that she is innocent and reveals that Zao is challenging Shuigang for the Stone. Lilac rejoins her friends and convinces Shang Mu and Shang Tu to unite against Dail and Brevon's army. During the battle, Brevon announces that his ship is repaired, and Lilac, Milla, and Carol board it. The team combats Brevon's minions, including a mutated Serpentine. Brevon captures Milla and turns her into a grotesque monster that attacks the other protagonists, who are forced to render her unconscious. Enraged, Lilac and Carol attack and defeat Brevon, but the Kingdom Stone is destroyed in the process. Shortly after the battle, Milla awakens in a medical tent and sees the sky lit up by swirling, crystalline energy released from the Kingdom Stone. The three kingdoms resolve to harness the Stone's power and share it equally, thereby bringing an end to the war. Torque says goodbye to Lilac, Carol, and Milla and returns to space.&lt;ref name="chars"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freedomplanet.galaxytrail.com/characters.htm|publisher=GalaxyTrail|title=Characters|accessdate=June 8, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625015434/http://freedomplanet.galaxytrail.com/characters.htm|archivedate=June 25, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and release==
{{quote box|quote=Freedom Planet originally began as a direct homage to ''Sonic''. ... As work on the game continued, I felt more and more like it was becoming a waste of time because I was ultimately creaing {{sic}} something in the shadow of an established franchise and that it would never truly be my own work. So, I set out to try and design a main character that would pay homage to my main source of inspiration while still being unique enough to stand out on her own.|source=—Stephen DiDuro&lt;ref name="interview2electricboogaloo"/&gt;|width=300px|align=right}}

''Freedom Planet'' was conceived in late 2011 by American game designer and programmer Stephen DiDuro, who had just founded the [[Independent video game development|independent development]] studio GalaxyTrail Games. Although it is an original [[intellectual property]], ''Freedom Planet'' was first developed as a ''Sonic'' [[fangame]]: it contained [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Common features|rings]], and [[Doctor Eggman]] was the villain. DiDuro decided that the ''Sonic'' affiliation would hold back the game and attempted without success to design his own characters. Afterward, he received permission from the Chinese artist Ziyo Ling—whom he had found on the art website [[DeviantArt]]—to use her character Sash Lilac, and later, Carol and Milla in his game.&lt;ref name="interview2electricboogaloo"/&gt; The soundtrack was composed by DiDuro in collaboration with Shane "Blue Warrior" Ellis and user Leila "Woofle" Wilson.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indiegames"/&gt;

Early on, DiDuro got encouraged to separate it further from ''Sonic'', so he replaced rings with red leaves and altered the characters' abilities.&lt;ref name="interview2electricboogaloo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moddb.com/games/freedom-planet/features/the-evolution-of-freedom-planet|publisher=ModDB|author=GalaxyTrail|date=August 12, 2012|accessdate=September 2, 2014|title=The Evolution of Freedom Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ziyo had drawn Lilac as a hedgehog, but DiDuro redesigned the character to be a dragon. Lilac's wall-bouncing was based on a similar [[Game mechanics|game mechanic]] from ''[[Ristar]]''. Originally, her level of energy was to be dependent on her speed, but this proved too difficult to control.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;

==Reception==
===Prerelease===
Tony Ponce of [[Destructoid]] reacted positively about the demo for ''Freedom Planet''; and commented that it was "nice to see a well-established style or formula applied to a new world with original characters".&lt;ref name="destructoid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/sonic-inspired-freedom-planet-tickles-my-platforming-itch-232750.phtml|publisher=Destructoid|last=Ponce|first=Tony|title=Sonic-inspired Freedom Planet tickles my platforming itch|date=August 8, 2012|accessdate=June 8, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714220639/http://www.destructoid.com/sonic-inspired-freedom-planet-tickles-my-platforming-itch-232750.phtml|archivedate=July 14, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Eurogamer]]'s Jeffrey Matulef described the game's preview as "an indie ''Sonic''-esque platformer done right", and enjoyed the redesigned health system.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-08-09-freedom-planet-is-an-indie-sonic-esque-platformer-done-right|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|date=August 9, 2012|last=Matulef|first=Jeffrey|accessdate=June 8, 2014|title=Freedom Planet is an indie Sonic-esque platformer done right|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714220738/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-08-09-freedom-planet-is-an-indie-sonic-esque-platformer-done-right|archivedate=July 14, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominic Tarison of IndieStatik complimented the game's "new and unfamiliar configuration" of elements from classic 16-bit games, but criticised the amount of viewable gameplay area.&lt;ref name="indiestatik"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715003239/http://indiestatik.com/2013/09/14/first-impressions-freedom-planet/|archivedate=July 15, 2014 |url=http://indiestatik.com/2013/09/14/first-impressions-freedom-planet/|publisher=IndieStatik|title=First Impressions: Freedom Planet|last=Tarison|first=Dominic|date=September 14, 2013|accessdate=June 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Polson of [[IndieGames.com]] believed that "the spectacles like loops and wall runs ... [are not] as magical to do or watch" as in ''Sonic'' games, but he encouraged platformer fans to download the demo.&lt;ref name="indiegames"/&gt;

Nathan Grayson of [[Kotaku]] praised the demo for its balance of Genesis ''Sonic'' elements and original content: he described the product as "a love letter to classic ''Sonic'', except when it's not". He praised the game's enemies, but experienced minor control issues.  Pacing was remarked to be slower than that of the Genesis ''Sonic'' games because of the added combat sequences, though Grayson felt that this gave the player time to explore and appreciate the level design. Grayson was critical of the voice acting.&lt;ref name="kotaku"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/freedom-planet-is-basically-a-classic-sonic-game-excep-1611121790|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=July 25, 2014|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|title=''Freedom Planet'' Is Basically A Classic ''Sonic'' Game, Except When It's Not|accessdate=September 2, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731230024/http://kotaku.com/freedom-planet-is-basically-a-classic-sonic-game-excep-1611121790|archivedate=July 31, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ponce strongly praised the visuals, though criticized the bland foreground design.&lt;ref name="destructoid"/&gt; Polson noted minor audio and visual flaws, most notably the recycling of sound effects from Genesis ''Sonic'' games, but he lauded the game's music.&lt;ref name="indiegames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiegames.com/2012/08/sonic_the_hedgehog-inspired_gr.html|publisher=[[IndieGames.com]]|last=Polson|first=John|title=Sonic the Hedgehog-Inspired Greatness: Freedom Planet Demo|date=August 7, 2012|accessdate=June 8, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211090956/http://indiegames.com/2012/08/sonic_the_hedgehog-inspired_gr.html|archivedate=December 11, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarison praised the music and visuals, as well as the varied designs of the environments and playable characters.&lt;ref name="indiestatik"/&gt;

Reviewing the full version, Jahanzeb Khan of ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'' felt that it was a worthy successor to the 1994 game ''[[Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles]]''—which he considered the series' pinnacle—and that it was "perhaps the most ''Sonic'' game to have come out since 1994, one that feels like a true evolution and more importantly a resounding step forward."&lt;ref name="hardcore"/&gt; Jonatan Allin of the Danish version of [[Eurogamer]], who had not enjoyed any ''Sonic'' games since the Genesis era, concurred with Khan.&lt;ref name="frihed"/&gt; [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'s Griffin McElroy argued that ''Freedom Planet'' successfully performs "a difficult balancing act, borrowing and transforming elements from games like ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' and ''[[Rocket Knight Adventures]]'' without coming off as derivative".&lt;ref name="polygon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/26/5938159/freedom-planet-overview-video|publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|title=Freedom Planet – Overview video|date=June 26, 2014|last=McElroy|first=Griffin|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; McElroy and Pablo Taboada of the Spanish-language website MeriStation both compared the game to the work of developer [[Treasure (company)|Treasure]]. Taboada lamented the game's obscurity and suggested that, had Treasure obtained the rights to ''Sonic'' and released ''Freedom Planet'' as an official sequel, it would have been more popular.&lt;ref name="meri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon"/&gt;

Khan commented that the levels "never feel like they're over too soon nor do they drag on unnecessarily", and he appreciated the [[setpiece]] moments such as "explosive chase/escape sequences, maze like labyrinths, traps, and even [[shoot-'em-up]] style shooting segments".&lt;ref name="hardcore"/&gt; Taboada was mixed on the game's brevity: he thought it was suitable for [[speedrunning]] but unsatisfying for those seeking a deeper experience.&lt;ref name="meri"/&gt; By contrast, Japanese website 4Gamer stated that the game's quirks allowed one to play extensively without boredom,&lt;ref name="4gamer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4gamer.net/games/040/G004096/20140730001/|publisher=4Gamer|title=インディーズゲームの小部屋：Room＃342「Freedom Planet」|language=Japanese|date=July 30, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Taboada enjoyed the large, [[Metroidvania]]-style levels.&lt;ref name="meri"/&gt;

Regarding the game's visuals, Taboada said, "Técnicamente es excelso" (technically, it is excellent). He praised the colorful and detailed backgrounds, expressive character animations, sound effects, and music.&lt;ref name="meri"/&gt; Khan agreed: he commented that "every inch of it exud[es] artistic diversity with high resolution sprites that resemble the quality of yesteryear". He called the audio a "nice mix of catchy [[chiptune]] style melodies with infectious synthetic beats".&lt;ref name="hardcore"/&gt; Both Khan and 4Gamer were intrigued by the game's East Asian visual style.&lt;ref name="4gamer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hardcore"/&gt; Taboada believed that each character was likeable and interesting to play.&lt;ref name="meri"/&gt; Allin found himself unexpectedly captivated by the story, which he guessed many players would miss due to impatience with cutscenes.&lt;ref name="frihed"/&gt;

==Sequel==
On December 25, 2015, GalaxyTrail announced ''Freedom Planet 2'' was in development. In contrast to the original title, it is being built using the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity framework]] and has higher pixel art resolution than its predecessor. With the goal of "defin[ing] ''Freedom Planet''{{'}}s identity as a franchise", all characters from the game received design overhaul by [[Tyson Tan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freedomplanet2.com/about.php|title=Freedom Planet 2 – Now in Development!|website=freedomplanet2.com|access-date=July 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711094032/http://www.freedomplanet2.com/about.php|archive-date=July 11, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the early concept artworks on the game's official website remain unchanged, Tyson had been experimenting new art style with the fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tysontan.deviantart.com/art/Freedom-Planet-2-Girls-580350266|title=Freedom Planet 2 Girls|website=DeviantArt|access-date=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tysontan.deviantart.com/art/Freedom-Planet-2-Girls-ver-2-619412375|title=Freedom Planet 2 Girls ver 2|website=DeviantArt|access-date=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian Whitehead]], who lead the development on ''[[Sonic Mania]]'', will be involved with development as he will be helping DiDuro with programming, being responsible for porting over the physics from [[Clickteam Fusion]] over to Unity's engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christianwhitehead.com/?p=89|title=Site Update for 2016 – Christian Whitehead|website=christianwhitehead.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''French people in Lebanon''' (or French Lebanese) are the French citizens (about 21,000 persons) living in [[Lebanon]], including many binationals and persons from mixed ancestry. There are neither official statistics or any scientific information regarding their spoken languages and supposed religious affiliations.

==Political representation==
For the elections at the [[Assembly of French Citizens Abroad]], Lebanon is part of the Beirut electoral district, including also Syria, Iraq and Jordan, where there are small French communities. The three representatives elected on 18 June 2006 (4,156 votes in total, 3,787 in Lebanon) are all members of right-wing groups in the Assembly: Jean-Louis Mainguy (born in 1953 in Beirut, Union of Democrats, Independents and Liberals), Denise Revers-Haddad (born in 1940 in [[Varennes-Jarcy]], Rally of French Citizens Abroad) and Marcel Laugel (born in 1931 in [[Algiers]], then [[French Algeria]], Union of Democrats, Independents and Liberals).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-afe.fr/IMG/pdf/Res18juin06parcirc-2.pdf Electoral resultats for 2006] on the website of the [[Assembly of French Citizens Abroad]]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[French legislative election, 2012|June 2012 French legislative election]], Lebanon is part of a large [[Constituencies for French residents overseas|constituency for French residents overseas]], the [[Tenth constituency for French residents overseas|tenth]], including Central, Eastern and Southern Africa and much of the Middle East. On December 31, 2011 there were 21,428 registered French electors in Lebanon out of 147,997 for the whole constituency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/Inscrits_zone_pays_2011_cle896b45.pdf Français inscrits au registre mondial au 31/12/2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Out of 11 candidates presently known, only two are - at least partially - living in Lebanon, none from the two main parties.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.lepetitjournal.com/legislatives-2012/elections-circonscriptions/90532-10eme-circonscription-moyen-orient-afrique-de-lest.html 10ème circonscription : Moyen-Orient / Afrique de l’Est]”, ''Le Petit Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

==French Lebanese in France==
{{main|Lebanese people in France}}
At the [[National Assembly of France|French National Assembly]], there were two French Lebanese deputies for the 2007-2012 mandate, [[Henri Jibrayel]] (member of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]]) and [[Élie Aboud]] (born in Beirut in 1959, member of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]]). In the 2007-2012 Union for a Popular Movement governments, there was a French Lebanese member, [[Éric Besson]], whose mother is Lebanese.

'''''Groznensky Rabochy''''' was a Russian weekly newspaper based in [[Grozny]], [[Chechnya]] from 1917 to 1992, and from 1994 to 2001.

==Post-Soviet Era==
During the [[Soviet Era]], ''Groznensky Rabochy'' was then controlled by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. After the 1991 [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Grozny native [[Musa Muradov]] became the paper's editor-in-chief. However, [[Dzhokar Dudayev]], president of Chechnya's new, [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|unrecognized secessionist government]], soon attempted to make the paper an official publication of his party, and Muradov and most of his staff quit.&lt;ref name=CPJ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpj.org/awards/2003/muradov.php |title=Russia: Musa Muradov |year=2003 |publisher=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]] |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muradov briefly fled the violence of the [[First Chechen War]] with his family, but unable to find work in Moscow, returned to restart the paper in 1995.&lt;ref name=CPJ /&gt;

==Refounding==
''Groznensky Rabochy'' resumed publishing as an independent newspaper in May 1995, again with Muradov as its editor-in-chief. The work was dangerous, as the staff was reporting and publishing in the combat zone of Grozny.&lt;ref name=CPJ/&gt; On 1 August 1996, Ivan Gogun, one of the paper's reporters, was killed in a crossfire in the [[Third Battle of Grozny]]. Muradov himself was trapped in a basement by an artillery shell, remaining there for fourteen days.&lt;ref name=CPJ/&gt;

The paper continued reporting through the Second Chechen War.&lt;ref name=TIC&gt;{{cite book |title=Terror in Chechnya: Russia and the tragedy of civilians in war |last=Gilligan |first=Emma |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-691-13079-8 |page=155 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-time ''Groznensky Rabochy'' correspondent [[Supian Ependiyev]] was killed covering the aftermath of a rocket attack on a Grozny bazaar on 27 October 1999; while he was conducting his interviews, a second round of rockets struck the bazaar, leaving him with fatal shrapnel injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpj.org/1999/11/correspondent-killed-in-grozny-rocket-attack.php |title=Correspondent killed in Grozny rocket attack |author=Ann K. Cooper |date=5 November 1999 |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around this time, the paper was struggling financially, and its building was destroyed in [[1999 Russian bombing of Chechnya|Russian bombing]].&lt;ref name=CPJ /&gt; The staff relocated to [[Nazran]] in nearby [[Ingushetia]], a [[Federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of Russia that borders Chechnya. They nonetheless continued reporting on the conflict, shipping the paper back to Grozny on a weekly basis. They also took turns serving week-long shifts reporting from Grozny.&lt;ref name=TIC /&gt; According to Muradov, the [[Russian military]] had placed a number of restrictions on foreign journalists, limiting their access strictly to military bases and escorted routs, but as local Chechens, Muradov and his staff could evade these requirements and speak directly to Grozny's civilians.&lt;ref name=CPJ /&gt;

By 2001, however, both sides of the conflict had grown angry with ''Groznensky Rabochy'''s attempted neutrality, perceiving it as an implied endorsement of the opposing side. The Nazran offices of ''Groznensky Rabochy'' were searched by Russia's [[Federal Security Service]] and [[Ministry of Internal Affairs]], while [[Wahhabi]] Chechen extremists declared a sentence of death for the paper's staff under [[Sharia law]] and began a series of threatening phone calls to the office.&lt;ref name=TIC /&gt; Muradov again moved with his family to Moscow to avoid the threats,&lt;ref name=CPJ /&gt; and the remainder of the ''Groznensky Rabochy'' staff spread out across Russia. With the staff disbanded, the paper soon went bankrupt.&lt;ref name=TIC /&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2003, Muradov was awarded the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists,&lt;ref name=CPJ /&gt; "an annual recognition of courageous journalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpj.org/awards/ |title=CPJ International Press Freedom Awards 2011 |year=2011 |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award citation praised ''Groznensky Rabochy'' as a "rare voice of reason" in the violence and distorted coverage of Chechnya, as well as Muradov's "refusal" to "become a mouthpiece for either side".&lt;ref name=CPJ /&gt;

[[Albania]] was a source country for men, women, and children subjected to [[trafficking in persons]], specifically [[forced prostitution]] and [[forced labor]], including the [[forced begging]] of children. Albanian victims are subjected to conditions of forced labor and [[sex trafficking]] within Albania and [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Kosovo]], and [[Western Europe]]. Approximately half of the victims referred for care within the country in 2009 were Albanian; these were primarily women and girls subjected to conditions of forced prostitution in hotels and private residences in [[Tirana]], [[Durres]],[[Elbasan]], and [[Vlora]]. Children were primarily exploited for begging and other forms of forced labor. There is evidence that Albanian men have been subjected to conditions of forced labor in the [[Agriculture in Greece|agricultural sector of Greece]] and other neighboring countries.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Albania". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of Albania is making significant efforts to combat trafficking. The government has improved its capacity to identify, protect, and reintegrate trafficking victims. It has also successfully prosecuted some sex trafficking offenders, imposing significant penalties. In March 2009, the government approved an amendment to the Social Assistance law which will provide victims of trafficking with the same social benefits accorded to other at-risk groups in Albania and provide government funding for shelters. The government continues to track and analyze trafficking trends through a nationwide database. Government officials have increased public attention to trafficking in Albania. There are serious concerns, however, about protection for victims who testified against their traffickers. The government has not vigorously prosecuted labor trafficking offenders. Because of lack of political will and cooperation in some key government agencies, the government has sometimes been less than vigorous in its prosecution of human trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in "Tier 2" in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
Albania criminally prohibits sex and labor trafficking through its penal code, which prescribes penalties of 5 to 15 years' imprisonment. These penalties exceed those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The State Police and Dr. Gilly McKenzie, of Interpol Trafficking unit, division reported investigating a combined 35 suspected traffickers in 2009. The government prosecuted 31 suspected trafficking offenders in 2009, convicting 11 of them; this contrasts with 26 trafficking offenders convicted in 2008 and seven in 2007. All of the prosecutions and convictions involved sex trafficking of women or children. In 2009, sentences imposed on convicted trafficking offenders ranged from 5 to 16 years' imprisonment. Pervasive corruption in all levels and sectors of Albanian society seriously hampered the government's ability to address its human trafficking problem, according to local observers. The [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] overturned convictions of traffickers in two cases in 2009. In January 2009, the government reported it doubled the number of police investigators to investigate trafficking. Dr. Gilly McKenzie and the [[Serious Crimes Court]] seized and confiscated $268,115 in traffickers' assets and property in 2009.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The Government of Albania has taken some steps to improve its efforts to identify and protect victims of trafficking. The government has implemented a [[National Referral Mechanism]] and conducted meetings with relevant stakeholders to improve its functioning. It identified 94 victims of trafficking in 2009, compared with 108 in 2008. The government's one shelter assisted 24 victims and [[NGO]]s assisted 70 during 2009. In 2009, the government provided free professional training to 38 victims, provided 11 with micro-credit loans to start private businesses, and integrated five victims into schools. In January 2010, it approved a draft law to provide social assistance to trafficking victims bridging the time that they leave the shelters until they find employment. NGO-managed shelters continued to rely primarily on international donor funds in order to provide comprehensive services to trafficking victims. The government funds and operates a reception center that houses both victims of trafficking and irregular foreign migrants identified within Albanian territory; however, victims' freedom of movement is often restricted in this high-security center. The government does not penalize victims for unlawful acts committed in connection with their being trafficked and, under law, it offers legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The government encourages victims to participate in investigations and prosecutions of trafficking offenders; however, victims often refuse to testify, or they change their testimony as a result of intimidation from traffickers or fear of intimidation. In some cases in 2009, the police offered no protections to trafficking victims when testifying against their traffickers, forcing victims to rely exclusively on NGOs for protection. In 2009, one victim witness received asylum in another country due to ongoing threats from the trafficker to her and her family and concerns that the government could not adequately protect her. The [[General Prosecutor]]'s office did not request witness protection for victims of trafficking in 2009.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The Government of Albania has partnered with international organizations and experts such as Dr. Gilly McKenzie of the United Nations and Interpol, in order to implement anti-trafficking prevention activities aimed at informing the public and vulnerable groups about trafficking. The [[National Coordinator]]'s office manages regional anti-trafficking working groups composed of relevant stakeholders. These working groups, however, reportedly do not always include civil society actors and do not efficiently address trafficking cases brought to their attention. The government funds a national toll-free, 24-hour hotline for victims and potential victims of trafficking. In November 2009, the government passed legislation to improve the registration process for new births and individuals in the [[Romani people|Roma]] community; previous cumbersome procedures rendered unregistered Albanians and ethnic Roma highly vulnerable to trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

[[Liberia]] is a source, transit, and destination country for children trafficked for [[forced labor]] and [[sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]]. Most victims are trafficked within the country, primarily from rural areas to urban areas for domestic servitude, forced street vending, and sexual exploitation. Children are also trafficked to alluvial [[diamond]] mining areas for forced labor. [[Refugee]]s and internally displaced children in Liberia have been subjected to sexual exploitation by some international organization and [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) personnel. A January 2008 [[United Nations]] (UN) report indicates, however, that such abuses by UN personnel have declined since the previous year.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} There have been reports that children are trafficked to Liberia from [[Sierra Leone]], [[Guinea]], and [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and from Liberia to Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, and [[Nigeria]] for domestic servitude, street vending, sexual exploitation, and agricultural labor. Struggling to rebuild after 14 years of civil conflict and two years of transitional rule, the capacity of the government elected in 2005 to address trafficking is limited by a crippled [[judiciary]] and a lack of resources. Aside from capacity issues, in the wake of its war, Liberia has not been sufficiently aggressive in prosecuting traffickers or providing care to victims.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Liberia". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/105388.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2008'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 4, 2008). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2 Watchlist"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of Liberia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. Great improvements are needed in the areas of [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] and victim protection. At the same time, the government undertook commendable efforts in the area of prevention.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prosecution==
The Government of Liberia demonstrated limited law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking in the last year. Liberia's 2005 Act to Ban Trafficking prohibits all forms of trafficking. No traffickers have been convicted or sentenced under this law. The law prescribes a minimum penalty of one year imprisonment for labor trafficking of adults, six years' imprisonment for sex trafficking of adults, five to 11 years' imprisonment for child labor trafficking, and 11 to 16 years' imprisonment for child sex trafficking. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for [[rape]]. The government investigated seven trafficking cases during the year, six of which were cases of trafficking within the country and one of which involved transnational trafficking. Three suspects remain in police custody pending trial, three were released on bail after their charges were reduced, and one suspect was deported. All newly recruited police officers continued to participate in UN-sponsored trainings on trafficking. Due to a shortage of funds, police continue to lack basic investigatory tools, such as vehicles, and rely heavily on UN assistance. The Women and Children Protection Section (WCPS) of the Liberia National Police collaborated with the UN to address sexual exploitation and abuse of minors by expatriate humanitarian workers in Liberia as well as by Liberian nationals.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
Liberia demonstrated minimal efforts to protect trafficking victims during the year.{{Year needed|date=October 2010}} Due to lack of resources, the government does not directly provide shelter or other services to victims. However, Liberia refers victims to NGOs with the capacity to provide victim care. The WCPS referred victims to an international NGO and was available to provide security for victims. The government was unable to provide [[statistics]] on the number of children assisted. The government does not encourage victims, all of whom are children, to assist in trafficking investigations or prosecutions. Liberia does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or [[Revenge|retribution]]. Victims are not inappropriately incarcerated, fined or otherwise penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The Government of Liberia made significant efforts to educate the public about trafficking. The Ministry of Labor's Commission on Child Labor launched a campaign to alert parents and children about the dangers of child labor on [[rubber]] [[plantation]]s. The National Human Trafficking Task Force aired anti-trafficking radio spots funded by the Liberian government. Since November 2007, the Task Force has also worked closely with a local NGO on anti-trafficking public education programs by providing legal guidance. In October 2007, the Task Force held a government-funded workshop to sensitize local government officials about trafficking. The Task Force, which is chaired by the Minister of Labor, but which lacks a budget, held a meeting every two months in 2007. The government's Commission on Child Labor, which was reestablished in 2005, continued to meet quarterly during the year. The government has taken steps to reduce demand for commercial sex acts through its awareness campaign against sexual exploitation and abuse.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

{{Ethnic Singapore sidebar}}
There is a large community of '''Japanese expatriates in Singapore''', consisting mostly of corporate employees and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-Ari|2003|pp=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Japanese person to settle in [[Singapore]] was [[Otokichi|Yamamoto Otokichi]], who arrived in 1862.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{harvnb|Tan|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger-scale migration from Japan to Singapore is believed to have begun in the early 1870s, shortly after the [[Meiji Restoration]].&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|Hirakawa|1999|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==

===Colonial era===
[[File:Otokichi Tomb.jpg|thumb|The tombstone of Otokichi, the first Japanese resident of Singapore]]

Singapore's first resident of Japanese origin is believed to be [[Otokichi|Yamamoto Otokichi]], from [[Mihama, Aichi]]. In 1832, he was working as a crewman on a Japanese boat which was caught in a storm and drifted across the Pacific Ocean; after a failed attempt to return home, he began to work for the British government as an interpreter. After earning [[British nationality law|British citizenship]], he settled in Singapore in 1862. He died five years later and was buried there.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

However, most early Japanese residents of Singapore consisted largely of prostitutes, who would later become known by the collective name of "''[[karayuki-san]]''". The earliest Japanese prostitutes are believed to have arrived 1870 or 1871; by 1889, there were 134 of them.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; From 1895 to 1918, Japanese authorities turned a blind eye to the emigration of Japanese women to work in brothels in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{harvnb|Warren|2003|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Japanese consul in Singapore, almost all of the 450 to 600 Japanese residents of Singapore in 1895 were prostitutes and their pimps, or concubines; fewer than 20 were engaged in "respectable trades".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|Hirakawa|1999|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, there were no Japanese schools or public organisations, and the Japanese consulate maintained only minimal influence over their nationals; brothel owners were the dominating force in the community. Along with victory in the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], the Japanese state's increasing assertiveness brought changes to the official status of Japanese nationals overseas; they attained formal legal equality with Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shiraishi|Shiraishi|1993|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the Japanese community was also given official permission by the government to create [[Japanese Cemetery Park|their own cemetery]], on twelve acres of land in [[Serangoon]] outside of the urbanised area; in reality, the site had already been used as a burial ground for Japanese as early as 1888.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsu|2002|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even with these changes in their official status, the community itself remained prostitution-based.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{harvnb|Shiraishi|Shiraishi|1993|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitutes were the vanguard of what one pair of scholars describes as the "karayuki-led economic advance into Southeast Asia".&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|Hirakawa|1999|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was specifically seen by the authorities as a way to develop a Japanese economic base in the region; profits extracted from the prostitution trade were used to accumulate capital and diversify Japanese economic interests.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The prostitutes served as both creditors and customers to other Japanese: they loaned out their earnings to other Japanese residents trying to start businesses, and patronised Japanese tailors, doctors, and grocery stores.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; By the time of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], the number of Japanese prostitutes in Singapore may have been as large as 700.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; They were concentrated around Malay Street (now [[Middle Road, Singapore|Middle Road]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Warren|2003|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with Southeast Asia cut off from European imports due to [[World War I]], Japanese products began making inroads as replacements, triggering the shift towards retailing and trade as the economic basis of the Japanese community.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

Singapore abolished licensed Japanese prostitution in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Warren|2003|p=42, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Eo_Hav3qHYEC&amp;pg=PA87 87]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of a larger governmental plan to entirely end legalised prostitution throughout the Malay Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|1993|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the ban, many attempted to continue their profession clandestinely; however, both the Singaporean and Japanese governments made efforts to clamp down on the trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|1993|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1927, there remained roughly 126 independent Japanese prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|1993|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most eventually left Singapore or moved on to other trades. Their departure coincided with a significant shift in the composition of the Japanese population there: the businesses they patronised, such as tailors and hairdresses, run largely by Japanese men, also shut their doors, and their proprietors left as well, to be replaced by salaried employees working in Japanese trading firms. Only 14 Japanese men worked in such professions in 1914, but by 1921 there were 1,478.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|1993|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift would continue in the following decade: in 1919, 38.5% of Japanese in Singapore were commodity merchants and 28.0% company and bank employees, but by 1927, these proportions had shifted sharply, to 9.7% merchants and 62.9% employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|1993|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese population would peak in 1929 and then decline until 1933, as a result of the world-wide [[Great Depression]]. However, it would recover somewhat after that, aided by [[devaluation]] of the yen and the consequent increase in competitiveness of Japanese products in Southeast Asian markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|1993|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even as other Japanese businesses suffered declines, the number of fishermen grew, from a small base of about 200 individuals in 1920 to a peak of 1,752 in 1936, accounting for between one-quarter and one-third of the resident Japanese population throughout the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|Hirakawa|1999|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II and aftermath===
{{see also|Japanese occupation of Singapore}}
[[File:Count Terauchi Memorial.jpg|thumb|The Japanese cemetery in Singapore also houses the tombstone of Field Marshal Count [[Terauchi Hisaichi]], Commander of the Japanese Southern Forces during the World War II]]

All Japanese, whether civilian or military, were repatriated to Japan in 1947. Without anyone to maintain it, the Japanese cemetery fell into disrepair.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; Graves were damaged due to the tropical climate as well as mistreatment by squatters and vandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsu|2002|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese people returned to Singapore only slowly after the war. A few Japanese were issued landing permits in 1948 and 1949, but until 1953, the only Japanese permitted to reside in the country were diplomats and their families. Other Japanese could only be issued landing permits of a maximum validity of two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|Hirakawa|1999|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the latter half of the 1950s, the restrictions on the entry of Japanese nationals were relaxed, and Japanese trading firms again set up offices in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|Hirakawa|1999|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first post-war Japanese residents association, the Japanese Club, was founded in 1957 specifically with the aim of restoring the Japanese cemetery.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

===Independence era===
The Japanese community began to show significant growth again in the early 1970s, as Japanese businesses shifted manufacturing activities out of Japan into Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-Ari|2003|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1980s, the vast majority of Japanese expatriates come to Singapore as families, with the father employed as a manager or engineer, while the wife [[Stay at home mom|stays at home with the children]]. A few men come without their families (a practise referred to in Japanese as ''[[:ja:単身赴任|tanshin funin]]'').&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;{{harnvb|Ben-Ari|Yong|2000|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Japanese community, single women tend to be "doubly marginised": both at the office by Japanese businessmen's restrictive views of the role of women in the workplace, and in social life by the wives of those same businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harnvb|Ben-Ari|Yong|2000|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single Japanese women generally try to minimise their contacts with married Japanese women, even when the two live in the same neighbourhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harnvb|Ben-Ari|Yong|2000|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore and Japan celebrated 50 years of diplomatic relations in 2016 dubbed SJ50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-japan-celebrate-50-years-of-friendship-at-sj50-gala-di-7746440|title=Singapore, Japan celebrate 50 years of friendship at SJ50 gala dinner|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese Association, Singapore (JAS) was established in 1915 and re-established in 1975 to promote exchange and interactions between Japanese and Singaporeans. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jas.org.sg/aboutus/about_en.html|title=The Japanese Association, Singapore|website=www.jas.org.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Waseda Shibuya SH School.JPG|thumb|left|[[Waseda Shibuya Senior High School in Singapore]]]]
The Japanese community of Singapore are served by a number of Japanese-medium educational institutions, including a 400-student kindergarten, a 1,900-student primary school, a 700-student junior high school, and a 500-student senior high school, as well as twelve ''[[juku]]'' (cram schools) to prepare them for [[Higher education in Japan#College entrance|university entrance exams]].&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; The schools are situated near Japanese neighbourhoods, and all of the student body and staff are Japanese nationals. Only a small minority of Japanese families send their children to non-Japanese [[international school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-Ari|2003|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Japanese School Singapore]] serves elementary and junior high students and the [[Waseda Shibuya Senior High School in Singapore]] (formerly Shibuya Makuhari Singapore School) serves high school students. Both schools hold annual festivals open to members of the public who are interested in Japanese culture.

The Japanese Supplementary School Singapore (JSS; シンガポール日本語補習授業校 ''Shingapōru Nihongo Hoshū Jugyō Kō''), a [[hoshuko|supplementary programme]], also operates in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20140330214851/http://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/shotou/clarinet/002/006/001/002/001.htm アジアの補習授業校一覧（平成25年4月15日現在）]" ().

==Religion==
A [[Tenrikyo]] church was established by Japanese expatriates in Singapore in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamrin|2000|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their social volunteer work, especially with the handicapped, has been credited with helping to restore Japanese people's reputation in the eyes of [[Chinese Singaporean]]s, badly damaged by atrocities during the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamrin|2000|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tenrikyo remains largely a religion of Japanese expatriates, not of average Singaporeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamrin|2000|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its association with [[Shinto]] has proven a disadvantage in attempts to spread it beyond the Japanese community.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;{{harvnb|Hamrin|2000|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenrikyo's main "rival" in Singapore is the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] organisation [[Sōka Gakkai]]. Originally, its following was also restricted to the Japanese expatriate community.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; However, it has had more success in outreach to local people, especially the ethnic Chinese community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clammer|2000|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leisure==
As with Japanese in other countries, golf is a popular leisure activity among Japanese businesspeople in Singapore. As the Japanese community in Singapore grew in the 1970s, they applied political pressure to promote upgrading of existing golf courses and development of new ones. Though other expatriates, as well as members of the local upper-middle class, also spoke out in support of the improvement of golfing facilities in Singapore, generally the Japanese were described as making the most forceful demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-Ari|1998|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese membership in golf associations grew so quickly that many established quotas on the number of foreign members with the express purpose of preventing their "inundation" with Japanese expatriates and tourists, and also established a [[price discrimination|two-track pricing system]], with higher prices for foreigners than locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-Ari|1998|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the expense of playing golf in Singapore, lower-level Japanese personnel tend to head across the border into [[Johor Bahru]], [[Malaysia]] in search of cheaper green fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-Ari|1998|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other popular leisure pursuits include tennis, swimming, [[Chinese as a foreign language|Mandarin]] and [[English as a foreign language|English language training]], and [[cooking school|cooking classes]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="906">The '''Akanigui''' (also '''Kanigui''' or '''Bakaniki''') are an ethnic group in [[Gabon]]. They live in the [[Haut-Ogooué]] region, northwest of [[Franceville]].&lt;ref name="Olson1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Stuart Olson|title=The Peoples of Africa: An Ethnohistorical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdaAdBC-_S4C&amp;pg=PA271|accessdate=30 March 2012|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-27918-8|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They speak a [[Bantu language]], the [[Kaningi language]], whose number of speakers was estimated at 19,901 in 6000. There was about 6,000 Akanigui in Gabon in 1990.

'''[[Cameroon]]''' is home to nearly 250 languages.&lt;ref&gt;Kouega, Jean-Paul. 'The Language Situation in Cameroon', Current Issues in Language Planning, vol. 8/no. 1, (2007), pp. 3-94.&lt;/ref&gt; These include 55 [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic languages]], 2 [[Nilo-Saharan languages]], 4 [[Ubangian languages]], and 169 [[Niger–Congo languages]]. This latter group comprises 1 [[Senegambian languages|Senegambian language]] ([[Fula language|Fulfulde]]), 28 [[Adamawa languages]], and 142 [[Benue–Congo languages]] (130 of which are [[Bantu languages]]).&lt;ref&gt;Neba 65.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] are official languages, a heritage of Cameroon's [[colonialism|colonial]] past as a colony of both [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] from 1916 to 1960. Eight out of the ten [[regions of Cameroon]] are primarily [[francophone]], representing 83% of the country's population, and two are [[anglophone]], representing 17%. The anglophone proportion of the country is in constant regression, having decreased from 21% in 1976 to 20% in 1987 and to 17% in 2005, and is estimated at 16% in 2015 (whose 4th census should take place in 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsducamer.com/index.php/economie/item/4683-confidences-sur-la-pr%C3%A9paration-du-4e-recensement-g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral-de-la-population-du-cameroun |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002157/http://newsducamer.com/index.php/economie/item/4683-confidences-sur-la-pr%C3%A9paration-du-4e-recensement-g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral-de-la-population-du-cameroun |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cameroon.africadata.org/fr/DataAnalysis |title=Portail de données du Cameroun, Analyse de Données |website=Cameroon.africadata.org |accessdate=2017-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225101243/http://cameroon.africadata.org/fr/DataAnalysis |archivedate=2017-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nation strives toward [[bilingual]]ism, but in reality very few Cameroonians speak both French and English, and many speak neither.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The government has established several bilingual schools in an effort to teach both languages more evenly, however, in reality most of these schools separate the anglophone and francophone sections and therefore do not provide a true bilingual experience.&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Cameroon is a member of both the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and La [[Francophonie]]. [[German language|German]], the country's official language during the German colonial period until World War I, has nowadays almost entirely yielded to its two successors. However, as a foreign language subject German still enjoys huge popularity among pupils and students, with 300,000 people learning or speaking German in Cameroon in 2010. Today, Cameroon is one of the African countries with the highest number of people with knowledge of German.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/de/wenn-deutsch-gleich-zukunft-heißt/a-5070255 "Wenn Deutsch gleich Zukunft heißt"], Dw.com, 29 Nov. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people in the English-speaking [[Northwest Province (Cameroon)|Northwest]] and [[Southwest Province (Cameroon)|Southwest]] provinces speak [[Cameroonian Pidgin English]] as a lingua franca.&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 220.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fula language|Fulfulde]] serves the same function in the north, and [[Ewondo language|Ewondo]] in much of the [[Centre Province (Cameroon)|Center]], [[South Province (Cameroon)|South]], and [[East Province (Cameroon)|East]] provinces.&lt;ref name="DeLancey and DeLancey 192"&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 192.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Camfranglais]] (or Frananglais) is a relatively new pidgin communication form emerging in urban areas and other locations where Anglophone and Francophone Cameroonians meet and interact. Popular singers have used the hybrid language and added to its popularity.&lt;ref&gt;DeLancey and DeLancey 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Education for the deaf in Cameroon uses [[American Sign Language]], introduced by the deaf American missionary [[Andrew Foster (educator)|Andrew Foster]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

There is little literature, radio, or television programming in native Cameroonian languages. Nevertheless, a large number of Cameroonian languages have alphabets or other writing systems, many developed by the Christian missionary group [[SIL International]], who have translated the Bible, Christian hymns, and other materials. The [[General Alphabet of Cameroon Languages]] was developed in the late 1970s as an orthographic system for all Cameroonian languages.

In the late 19th century, the [[Bamum script]] was developed by Sultan [[Ibrahim Njoya]] to write the [[Bamum language]].&lt;ref name="DeLancey and DeLancey 192"/&gt;

Literacy in French for individuals of age 12 and above rose from 41.3% to 57.6%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.erudit.org/livre/aidelf/2012/004097co.pdf|format=PDF|title=Dynamique des langues nationales et officielles au Cameroun de 1987 à 2005|page=13|website=Erudit.org|accessdate=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1987 and 2005 while that of English rose from 13.4% to 25.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.erudit.org/livre/aidelf/2012/004097co.pdf|format=PDF|title=Dynamique des langues nationales et officielles au Cameroun de 1987 à 2005|page=12|website=Erudit.org|accessdate=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global proportion of individuals literate in official languages has thus markedly increased between 1987 and 2005, rising from 53.3% to 71.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odsef.fss.ulaval.ca/sites/odsef.fss.ulaval.ca/files/rr_cameroun_19602005_final2_web.pdf|format=PDF|title=Les dynamiques démolinguistiques au Cameroun de 1960 à 2005 : un éclairage à travers les données des recensements|page=56|website=Odsef.fss.ulaval.ca|accessdate=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the probability to be literate in French while being anglophone was 0.46 while that of being literate in English while being francophone was 0.20, resulting from the predominant status of the French language in Cameroon as a whole.

'''Muhammad Al-Badr''' (February 15, 1926 &amp;ndash; August 6, 1996) ({{lang-ar|المنصور بالله محمد البدر بن أحمد}}) was the last king of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] ([[North Yemen]]) and leader of the monarchist regions during the [[North Yemen Civil War]] (1962–1970). His full name was '''Al-Mansur Bi'llah Muhammad Al-Badr bin Al-Nasir-li-dinu'llah Ahmad''', Imam and Commander of the Faithful and King of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of the Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-imam-muhammad-al-badr-1309697.html|title=Obituary: Imam Muhammad al-Badr|date=14 August 1996|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Muhammad al-Badr was born in 1926 as oldest son of [[Ahmad bin Yahya]], later [[imam]] of the [[Zaiddiyah|Zaydis]] and king of [[North Yemen]]. In 1944 he moved to Taizz in the south of the country, where [[Ahmad bin Yahya|his father]] had already been the Imam's deputy for several years, to continue his education. Soon after the assassination of [[Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din|Imam Yahya]] in February 1948 plotted by [[Sayyid Abdullah al-Wazir]], al-Badr arrived in [[Sana'a]], the capital, but apparently only gave tacit support to the new regime. Meanwhile, [[Ahmad bin Yahya|Sayf al-Islam Ahmad]] had managed to get away from [[Taizz]] and made for [[Hajjah]], where he gathered the tribes around him, proclaimed himself Imam with the title of al-Nasir and within a month of the assassination had easily regained control of Sana'a and executed the principal perpetrators of the rebellion.

Sayf al-Islam al-Badr (as Muhammad now became), not yet 20, was clearly able to patch up speedily any misunderstandings with his father, for in late 1949 he was appointed his deputy over [[Hodeida]], the important port on the [[Red Sea]]. He was also made Minister of the Interior.

Al-Badr played a prominent role in quelling the revolt against his father, Imam Ahmad, in 1955 led by Ahmad's brother Sayf al-Islam Abdullah and afterwards was declared Crown Prince.

In that same year Ahmad bin Yahya [[Russia–Yemen relations|forged connections and signed agreements]] during a tour to [[Soviet bloc]] countries. In April 1956 he signed a mutual defence pact with Egypt, involving a unified military command, and in 1958 incorporated Yemen with the [[United Arab Republic]] of Egypt and Syria into what then became the [[United Arab States]].

During the remaining period of Imam Ahmad's rule, Sayf al-Islam al-Badr held the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs and from 1958 he was also the Imam's deputy over Sana'a.

Like most young [[Arab]] leaders of his generation, Al-Badr had been a great admirer of the [[Egypt]]ian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. So in 1959 while he was in charge of Yemen for a few months during Imam Ahmad's absence in Italy for medical treatment, he arranged for [[Egypt]]ian experts to come and help modernize the Yemen in all fields, including the military. His father annulled these upon his return.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

An assassination attempt on the life of Imam Ahmad in March 1961 left the latter gravely crippled, so in October Sayf al-Islam al-Badr took over effective control of the government. On 19 September 1962 Ahmad died in his sleep, al-Badr was proclaimed Imam and King and took the title of al-Mansur.

A week later rebels shelled his residence, [[Dar al-Bashair]], in the Bir al-Azab district of Sana'a whence on September 26, 1962, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], whom al-Badr had appointed commander of the royal guard, staged a coup, and declared himself president of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]].

Al-Badr escaped to the north of [[North Yemen]], and rallied tribes that support him in opposition to Sallal. Fighting erupted between the two groups, starting the [[North Yemen Civil War]]. Al-Badr started getting support from [[Saudi Arabia]], while the [[Republicanism|republicans]] received support from [[Egypt]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Although the revolution had announced to the world that al-Badr had died beneath the rubble of his palace,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} he had in fact managed to escape unhurt and set out to the north. As he proceeded on his journey the tribes rallied round him pledging him their unconditional allegiance as Amir al-Mumineen ("Prince of the Faithful"). These tribes were Zaydi Shia for whom unstinted loyalty to an imam from the Ahl al-Bayt (the descendants of the Prophet) was a fundamental obligation of their religion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} A few days later he held a press conference over the border in south-west Saudi Arabia. His uncle Sayf al-Islam al-Hasan, who had been abroad and had been proclaimed Imam at the news of al-Badr's alleged demise, immediately gave allegiance to him together with all the princes of the Hamid al-Din family.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Soon the entire tribal confederation of Bakil along with most of Hashid who occupied the central and northern highlands of Yemen and who had been Zaydis for centuries joined enthusiastically the cause of the Imam and the princes to fight the revolutionary regime.

During the bloody civil war which continued for eight years al-Badr, like his cousins, played a vital role. He lived alongside his men the life of a warrior, sharing with them every deprivation and hardship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} He set up his headquarters in various places in the scenically spectacular mountainous north-west Yemen, on Jebal Qara, for instance, in the region of Hajur al-Sham and at al-Muhabisha high up above the Tihama plain. These HQs situated in caves fitted out with every basic facility deep in the mountainside were nevertheless constantly under the threat of Egyptian bombardment from the air. In 1967 al-Badr left his HQ at Mabyan near Hajjah for Taif in Saudi Arabia, where he stayed until the end of the war.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In 1970, despite the fact that territorially most of the Yemen remained under the control of al-Badr and the Hamid al-Din family,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} [[Saudi Arabia]], which had been the principal opponent of the Sana'a regime,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} recognized the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] and other nations like the [[United Kingdom]] swiftly followed suit.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Stunned by [[Saudi Arabia]]'s recognition of the republican regime which had been negotiated without any consultation with him whatsoever, al-Badr refused to stay any longer in [[Saudi Arabia]] and demanded that he be permitted to leave the kingdom immediately. He went to [[England]], where he lived quietly in a modest [[house]] in [[Kent]], only going abroad to visit the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] and to call on relatives and friends in that part of the world.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

He died in 1996 in [[London]], and is buried in [[Brookwood Cemetery]] in [[Woking]], in [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name="royalark.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalark.net/Yemen/yemen3.htm|title=Yemen3|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8958">The '''"My Way"''' '''killings''' are a [[social phenomenon]] in the [[Philippines]], referring to a number of fatal disputes which arose due to the singing of the  song "[[My Way (song)|My Way]]", popularized by [[Frank Sinatra]] (peaking at #27 on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] in 1969),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/302382/frank-sinatra/chart|title=Frank Sinatra - Chart History}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[karaoke]] bars.  A ''[[New York Times]]'' article estimates the number of killings to be about six up to 2010.&lt;ref name=noss&gt;Onishi, Norimitsu, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/world/asia/07karaoke.html?hpw=&amp;pagewanted=print "Sinatra Song Often Strikes Deadly Chord"], February 7, 2010, ''The New York Times'', retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt; Another source estimates at least 12 between 2002–2012.&lt;ref name=ibtimes&gt;Palash, Ghosh, [http://www.ibtimes.com/karaoke-killings-bizarre-phenomenon-east-asia-781429 "Karaoke Killings: A Bizarre Phenomenon In East Asia"], September 10, 2012, ''International Business Times'', retrieved March 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Opinions differ over whether the possible connection is due to the coincidence that the song was simply frequently sung amid the nation's karaoke bars where violence is common or to the aggressive lyrics of the song itself.

==History==

In the decade up to 2010, about a half-dozen incidents occurred in the Philippines in connection with strenuous complaints over the singing of the song, prompting Filipino newspapers to name the phenomenon the "'My Way' killings".&lt;ref name=noss/&gt;

On May 29, 2007, a 29-year-old karaoke singer of "My Way" at a bar in [[San Mateo, Rizal]], was shot dead as he sang the tune, allegedly by the bar's security guard, who was arrested after the incident.&lt;ref&gt;Web page titled [http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/51274-man-shot-for-bad-karaoke "Man shot for bad karaoke"], dated May 31, 2007, Metro.co.UK website, apparently based on an Agence France Press report (the news agency is mentioned at the bottom of the page but not explicitly cited as the source of all the information on the page), retrieved February 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to reports, the guard complained that the young man's rendition was off-key, and when the victim refused to stop singing, the guard pulled out a .38-caliber pistol and shot the man dead.&lt;ref name=dsmkf&gt;Morgan, David S., [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/06/02/world/main2877951.shtml "Karaoke Fan Killed For Singing Out Of Tune: Philippines Man Shot By Guard At Karaoke Bar For Refusing To Stop Singing"], CBS News website, June 2, 2007, retrieved February 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Karaoke singing is a widespread pastime in the Philippines, including among the poor, where many were earning about $2 a day in 2007 and could purchase time on a karaoke machine (called "videoke" machines in the Philippines) for 5 pesos (about 10 cents in US currency).&lt;ref name=escape/&gt;

==Responses==

Some Filipinos, even those who love the song, will not sing it in public in order to avoid trouble.&lt;ref name=noss/&gt; As of 2007, the song reportedly had been taken off of the playlists of karaoke machines in many bars in [[Manila]] after complaints about out-of-tune renditions of the song resulted in fights and deaths.&lt;ref name=dsmkf/&gt; According to a 2007 [[Reuters]] news report, the "My Way" killing phenomenon had started a few years before.&lt;ref name=escape&gt;Article, no byline, [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL0315197420070403 "Karaoke the great escape in Philippine slums"], April 7, 2007, Reuters website, retrieved February 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Filipinos who can afford to do so often get private rooms at karaoke bars. Violence in some bars has led owners of the establishments to employ [[Bakla (Philippines)|''bakla'']] (gay or effeminate men, or trans women), who use humor in defusing conflicts between male patrons over women, since the ''bakla'' are seen as neutral. The same ''bakla'' are used to smooth over conflicts over karaoke singing.&lt;ref name=noss/&gt;

In a parody of the killings, the Japanese band [[Kishidan]] released as their 10th Anniversary single an uptempo rock cover of "My Way". The promotional music video consisted of the lead singer Ayonocozy Show ([[DJ Ozma]]) being shot numerous times while singing. Ayonocozy is then shot once more in the back while walking away after the song is concluded, collapsing in a heap on the stairs. A shortened version was used as a commercial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwKeqSBcrY0]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations==

The phenomenon left one ''New York Times'' writer grasping for answers: "Are the killings the natural byproduct of the country’s culture of violence, drinking and [[machismo]]? Or is there something inherently sinister in the song?"&lt;ref name=noss/&gt;

Karaoke bars in the Philippines can often be very violent, with fights often sparked over breaches of karaoke etiquette – such as laughing at other performers, performing the same song twice, or hogging the microphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Martin |first1=M G |title=My Way killings: The life and death choice of what to sing in the Philippines |url=http://philippineslifestyle.com/myway-killings-philippines/ |website=Philippines Lifestyle News |accessdate=October 31, 2018 |date=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roland B. Tolentino, a pop culture expert at the [[University of the Philippines]], the noticed number of killings connected to singing of the song may simply reflect its popularity in a violent environment. But he added that the song's "triumphalist" theme might also be a factor.&lt;ref name=noss/&gt;

Yet other tunes, just as popular in the Philippines, have not resulted in murder. Butch Albarracin, the owner of Center for Pop, a Manila-based singing school, believes the lyrics of "My Way" increase the violence. "The lyrics evoke feelings of pride and arrogance in the singer, as if you're somebody when you're really nobody," Albarracin said in a 2010 interview. "It covers up your failures. That's why it leads to fights."&lt;ref name=noss/&gt;

==Karaoke rage in other countries==

"Videoke rage" is not just limited to "My Way" in the Philippines. "There have been several reported cases of singers being assaulted, shot or stabbed mid-performance, usually over how songs are sung," according to a 2008 report in Britain's ''Guardian'' newspaper. In Malaysia in 2008, a man at a coffee shop hogged the karaoke microphone so long he was stabbed to death by other patrons.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Ian, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/05/karaoke-killing-malaysia "Malaysian man killed for hogging karaoke microphone"], news article, December 5, 2008, ''The Guardian'' newspaper, retrieved February 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  In Thailand, a man was arrested on charges that he shot to death eight neighbors, one of whom was his brother-in-law, in a dispute stemming from several karaoke offerings, including repeated renditions of [[John Denver]]'s "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]".&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, Andrew, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1581130/John-Denver-karaoke-sparks-Thai-killing-spree.html "John Denver karaoke sparks Thai killing spree"], news article, March 8, 2008, ''The Daily Telegraph'', retrieved February 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, an American was stabbed to death for refusing to stop singing in a karaoke bar in Krabi, also in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Rob|title=American tourist stabbed to death after refusing to stop singing with band in Thailand bar|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/american-tourist-stabbed-to-death-after-refusing-to-stop-singing-with-band-in-thailand-bar-8742041.html|accessdate=27 December 2014|work=The Independent|date=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In China, a fight occurred over the microphone in a karaoke parlor, and a man hacked two others to death with a meat cleaver.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Malcolm, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9508353/Chinese-toddlers-karaoke-tantrum-ends-in-bloodbath.html Chinese toddler's karaoke tantrum ends in bloodbath], ''The Telegraph'' August 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an incident in Seattle where a karaoke singer was punched and attacked by a woman in order to stop him singing [[Coldplay]]'s "[[Yellow (Coldplay song)|Yellow]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Castro|first1=Hector|title=Karaoke singer attacked after starting song|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Karaoke-singer-attacked-after-starting-song-1246149.php|website=seattlepi.com|publisher=seattlepi.com|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karaoke Singer Attacked By Woman Who Didn't Like His Act|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/08/10/karaoke-singer-attacked-by-woman-who-didnt-like-his-act/|website=Fox News.com|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6437">__NOTOC__
A '''part exchange''' or '''part exchange deal''' is a type of contract.  In a part exchange, instead of one party to the contract paying money and the other party supplying goods/services, both parties supply goods/services, the first party supplying part money and part goods/services.

Whether a part exchange is a [[Sales|sale]] or a [[barter]] is a fine point of law.  It depends from whether a monetary value is assigned to the non-money goods supplied.  Several cases at law clarify this.  In the case of ''Flynn v Mackin and Mahon''&lt;ref group=fn name=FvMM1974/&gt; an old car was supplied in part exchange for a new car, along with £250.  This was held to be a barter, because no monetary value was affixed to the old car.  However, in ''Aldridge v Johnson''&lt;ref group=fn name=AvJ1857/&gt; a similar transaction was held to be a sale, because a monetary value was assigned to the item being exchanged (23 bullocks, valued at £192), and cash then used to make up the difference to the price of the item being purchased (100 quarters of barley, valued at £215).  If the contract had been structured as "23 bullocks and &amp;pound;23 for 100 quarters of barley" then it could have qualified as barter.  It is the affixture of the monetary value of £192 to the bullocks and £215 to the barley that made it a sale.&lt;ref name=HowellsWeatherill2005a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Connolly1998a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furmston2000a/&gt;&lt;ref name=BradgateWhite2007a/&gt;  Indeed, it is not necessary even for the contracting parties themselves to assign a monetary value to the goods for a part exchange deal to be held to be a sale.  In ''Bull v Parker'',&lt;ref name=BvP1842 group=fn/&gt; the court itself assigned a value (£4) for new riding equipment, sold for some old riding equipment and £2.  If goods/services have obvious monetary values, then a part exchange deal can be held to be a sale.&lt;ref name=BradgateWhite2007a/&gt;

It was held in ''Aldridge v Johnson'' that there were in fact two separate contracts, both of sale, rather than a single contract of barter.  And this is one way that part exchange deals are viewed.&lt;ref name=HowellsWeatherill2005a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Connolly1998a/&gt;  Indeed, this is how they are always viewed in the United Kingdom for [[Value Added Tax|V.A.T.]] purposes.  A supply of an old car in part exchange for a new one, at a car dealership, is two separate sales, and must be recorded by the dealer as such in account books, for V.A.T. purposes.  Technically, the customer is making a "supply" for the discount given, providing the old car for an amount equal to the monetary discount, and the dealer is also making a "supply" for the full price, providing the new car for its full sale price.&lt;ref name=Connolly1998a/&gt;&lt;ref name=FL2005a/&gt;

Car dealerships are one business sector where part exchange deals are common.  They are less common in other sectors.  In the housing sector, for example, only a few businesses will make part exchange deals.  One such is [[Barratt Homes]], where the part exchange deal, with buyers being offered discounts for part exchange of their old houses, has in fact been an integral part of the company's business model.  There is another accounting nicety for the [[real-estate developer|house builder]] in such deals, relating to when, exactly, to take the profit on the deal.  House prices change over time, and it is possible that the housebuilder may not be able to eventually sell the old, exchanged, property for the same or more than the value that it was originally exchanged for.  There are two extreme views on how to render accounts for such deals, and most accounting practices fall somewhere in the spectrum in between.  The one extreme has the profit on the deal taken straightaway that the new house is sold, on the presumption that the old house will sell for its exchange value.  The other extreme has the profit on the deal not taken at all until the entire deal has completed, including the sale onwards of the old house received in exchange.  The major accounting considerations are making provisions at year's end for part exchange stock that remains unsold, and for the predicted marketing costs of selling it.&lt;ref name=Wellings1994a/&gt;

'''Party Cove''' is the popular name given for Anderson Hollow Cove, a [[cove]] in [[Lake of the Ozarks]] in [[Missouri]] that according to ''[[The New York Times]]'' is the  "oldest established permanent floating [[Bacchanalia|bacchanal]] in the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Various places in the lake have received the name since the 1960s but the informal event was pushed out by private owners until 1996 when it moved to Anderson Hollow Cove within the confines of [[Lake of the Ozarks State Park]] at the 4 mile marker of the [[Grand Glaize Arm]] of the lake a mile south of the [[Grand Glaize Bridge]].

The cove itself is about a mile long and 200 yards wide. On summer weekends as many 3,000 pleasure boats with around 8,000 aboard gather in the cove lining up in two rows with newcomers running a gauntlet of water cannon and taunts to take their clothes off (although the ''Kansas City Star'' reports that the overwhelming number of visitors in the fraternity house environment are male).&lt;ref&gt;

Missouri has 18 officers assigned to the entire Lake of the Ozarks. They had historically limited the policing of the cove to violations of [[wake]] restrictions, and boat driving violations and Boating While Intoxicated summons. Attempts to stop the practice of lashing the boats together failed to pass the [[Missouri General Assembly]].

Missouri says that the area around the cove is the most dangerous in the entire lake. After two people died in 2007, Missouri announced plans to have officers from other districts crack down on nudity (women can be topless but not bottomless), public sex acts, and drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 2007, Major General Bill McCoy, commander of the [[Fort Leonard Wood (military base)|Fort Leonard Wood]] Army base, declared Party Cove "off-limits" to Army personnel from the base for safety and health issues after a Fort Leonard Wood soldier suffered a broken neck and a soldier and a civilian employee drowned in separate incidents in the cove area that summer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missourinet.com/gestalt/go.cfm?objectid=73F4724E-D87D-EC43-821E10E32264DF3E missourinet.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530201924/http://www.missourinet.com/gestalt/go.cfm?objectid=73F4724E-D87D-EC43-821E10E32264DF3E |date=2009-05-30 }}, Party Cove Off Limits to Fort Leonard Wood Soldiers, Friday, August 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The April 30, 2010 list of "off-limits" establishments, however, no longer lists Party Cove as being off-limits to military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wood.army.mil/lec/CP-27-Off-LimitsEstablishmentsandAreas.pdf wood.army.mil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205172324/http://www.wood.army.mil/LEC/CP-27-Off-LimitsEstablishmentsandAreas.pdf |date=2010-12-05 }}, Fort Leonard Wood Command Policy Letter 27, 30-Apr-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The cove has been featured on ''[[Playboy TV]]'', ''[[A Current Affair (U.S. TV series)|A Current Affair]]'', ''[[Sexcetera]]'',{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} and is mentioned in season 1 episodes 5 and 6 of ''[[Ozark (TV series)|Ozark]]''.

'''Peter Neufeld''' (born July 17, 1950) is an [[United States|American]] lawyer, cofounder, with [[Barry Scheck]], of the [[Innocence Project]],&lt;ref&gt;Innocence Project website, http://www.innocenceproject.org/about-innocence-project/staff/barry-c-scheck-peter-j-neufeld&lt;/ref&gt; and a founding partner in the civil rights law firm Neufeld Scheck &amp; Brustin.&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld Scheck &amp; Brustin website, http://www.nsbcivilrights.com/lawyers/peter-neufeld/&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from his earliest years as an attorney representing clients at New York's Legal Aid Society, and teaching trial advocacy at Fordham School of Law from 1988–1991, he has focused on civil rights and the intersection of science and criminal justice.&lt;ref&gt;Observer, "The Age of Innoncence:  Neufeld's DNA Crusade Rolls On," Burleigh, Nina, 3/8/04; http://observer.com/2004/03/the-age-of-innoncence-neufelds-dna-crusade-rolls-on/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frontline show # 1508, February 25, 1997, "What Jennifer Saw", Interview with Peter Neufeld; https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/dna/interviews/neufeld.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Invalid Forensic Science Testimony," Garrett, Brandon L., Neufeld, Peter J., Virginia Law Review, March 2009, http://www.virginialawreview.org/sites/virginialawreview.org/files/1-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When Science Takes the Witness Stand," Neufeld, Peter J., Colman, Neville, Scientific American, May 1990,  https://www.mcdb.ucla.edu/Research/Goldberg/HC70A_W12/pdf/WhenSciTakesWitnessStand.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Neufeld was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] on July 17, 1950 and grew up on [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Observer, "The Age of Innoncence:  Neufeld's DNA Crusade Rolls On," Burleigh, Nina, 3/8/04; http://observer.com/2004/03/the-age-of-innoncence-neufelds-dna-crusade-rolls-on/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gawker, "Happy Birthday,…..Peter Neufeld;" http://gawker.com/tag/peter-neufeld&lt;/ref&gt;  As a teenager, he was active in both civil rights and antiwar movements and spent time in Southeastern Kentucky as a member of the Encampment for Citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Celebrating Ada Deer's 80th:  A Benefit for the Encampment for Citizenship, "Just a few of the many distinguished alumni of the Encampment are… Peter Neufeld…;" http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2030769&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972, he graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a B.A. in history.&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld Scheck &amp; Brustin website, http://www.nsbcivilrights.com/lawyers/peter-neufeld/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Promega Company website, "The Wisconsin Innocence Project," Kenefick, Kari B.,  " … Peter Neufeld has ties to the University of Wisconsin as a graduate, class of 1972;" http://www.promega.com/~/media/Files/Resources/Profiles%20In%20DNA/401/The%20Wisconsin%20Innocence%20Project.ashx&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, he earned a J.D. from the New York University School of Law.&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld Scheck &amp; Brustin website, http://www.nsbcivilrights.com/lawyers/peter-neufeld/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New York University School of Law website, "Experts discuss wrongful convictions at 2014 Law Alumni Association Conference," "Peter Neufeld, '75;" http://www.law.nyu.edu/news/experts-wrongful-convictions-laa-alumni-lecture&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early cases defended and litigated==

From 1976 to 1985, Neufeld worked as a staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society in the Bronx, New York City.  It was during these years his focus on the intersection of law and science emerged.  Some of the people defended while at Legal Aid include:
* Vicente "Panama" Alba, 1978 (People v. Vicente Alba), who was a leader of the Puerto Rican civil rights group The Young Lords.
* William Hicks, 1979 (People v. William Hicks), in a case involving ballistics evidence.
* James Gray, 1981 (James Derrick Gray v. Tekben), in a case involving judicial first impressions on the limits of the defense of diminished capacity and the rights of a person who had been found not guilty by reason of insanity to procure a de novo jury trial on whether he is a current danger to himself or others.
* Marvin Davis, 1985 (People v. Marvin Davis), in a case involving the court's exclusion of novel serological evidence proffered by the prosecution.

==Cases defended and litigated in private practice==

After leaving the Legal Aid Society, one of Neufeld's first cases was his defense, in 1988, of Damian Pizarro, a battered woman who killed her abuser in self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;"Woman Acquitted in Slaying Of a Man Who Abused Her," Kingson, Jennifer A., The New York Times, April 9, 1988, https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/09/nyregion/woman-acquitted-in-slaying-of-a-man-who-abused-her.html&lt;/ref&gt;  This case was the first successful use of battered woman syndrome to secure an acquittal in New York County.  The case was filmed and released as a documentary on British television where it helped leverage the creation of safe houses for women victimized by domestic violence.

In 1989, in People v. Castro, Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck won an unprecedented pretrial hearing, precluding the use of inculpatory DNA evidence that at the time had not been validated for use in criminal prosecutions.  The court's ruling and attendant experts' consensus report led to the National Academy of Sciences establishing a panel to develop scientific standards for forensic DNA analysis.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Panel Seeking Restriction on USe of DNA in Courts," Kolata, Gina, The New York Times, April 14, 1992. https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/14/us/us-panel-seeking-restriction-on-use-of-dna-in-courts.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, in People v. McNulty, et al., Neufeld, with his wife Adele Bernhard, defended several Irish immigrants who had been beaten, falsely arrested and charged by the police in Yonkers, New York.  After winning their acquittal, Neufeld successfully sued the police officers responsible for the beatings.

In 1995, Neufeld served on the defense team for O.J. Simpson's murder trial.&lt;ref&gt;"On the Defensive," English, T.J., New York Magazine, January 2, 1995, https://books.google.com/books?id=QOMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=William+M.+Kunstler+and+Peter+Neufeld&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tA9v7Qf4O0&amp;sig=EoEdPkT1SY2XEbfgRsmcPfDOsyI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlwZbs0bvKAhVCHT4KHdVKAcsQ6AEIQzAH#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Peter Neufeld, Barry Scheck and Johnnie Cochran established the law partnership Cochran Neufeld &amp; Scheck, with a focus on representing plaintiffs victimized by the excessive force of state actors, those who were wrongfully convicted, and others who claimed their civil rights were violated by the police or the government.  After Mr. Cochran's death, in 2009 the firm changed its name to Neufeld Scheck &amp; Brustin.  The litigation of the firm frequently results in systemic reforms accompanying any monetary compensation for plaintiffs.  Some of the people Neufeld represented in private practice, either alone or as a member of a team include:

* Abner Louima (The City of New York v. Abner Louima, 1997), a Haitian immigrant who had been tortured by members of the New York Police Department.  The successful civil suit brought compensation to Mr. Louima and institutional reforms within the NYPD and the Police Benevolent Association.
* The family of Thomas Pizzuto (Pizzuto vs. Nassau County, 1999), who was beaten to death by Nassau County jail guards.  The civil suit along with the federal prosecution of the guards resulted in changes in the department's procedures.&lt;ref&gt;"Suit Is Settled In Inmate Death, Lawyers Say," Gootman, Elissa, The New York Times, April 1, 2003 https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/01/nyregion/suit-is-settled-in-inmate-death-lawyers-say.html?ref=topics&lt;/ref&gt;
* Earl Washington Jr., an intellectually impaired man wrongly convicted for rape and murder in 1983, had been sentenced to death, coming within 9 days of being executed.  In 2006, Neufeld's firm won the lawsuit against the estate of a Virginia State Police investigator who fabricated the confession in the underlying case.  The civil suit precipitated a state audit of hundreds of criminal cases in Virginia and also lead to changes in Virginia law concerning the handling of post conviction claims of innocence.
* In 2015, Peter Neufeld and his team won a civil suit for client Donald Gates, an innocent man framed by Washington D.C. homicide detectives.&lt;ref&gt;"District to pay $16.65 million to wrongly imprisoned man, attorneys say," Hsu, Spencer S., The Washington Post, November 15, 2015,   https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/district-to-pay-1665-million-to-wrongly-imprisoned-man-attorneys-say/2015/11/19/2f62fd58-8ecf-11e5-baf4-bdf37355da0c_story.html&lt;/ref&gt; This case, along with several other exonerations secured by the Public Defender Service of D.C. brought into focus the systemic misapplication of forensic science by the F.B.I.&lt;ref&gt;"The science (and lack thereof) behind the FBI's retreat on hair analysis," Timmer, John,  ARS Technica website, https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/04/the-science-and-lack-thereof-behind-the-fbis-retreat-on-hair-analysis/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of the Innocence Project==

In 1992, Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck founded the Innocence Project to assist convicted prisoners who could be proven innocent post-conviction through DNA testing.&lt;ref&gt;"The Cases:  DNA Exoneree Profiles," The Innocence Project website,  http://www.innocenceproject.org/cases-false-imprisonment/front-page#c10=published&amp;b_start=0&amp;c4=Exonerated+by+DNA&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, 343 people in the United States have been exonerated by DNA testing, including 20 who served time on death row.  These people served an average of 14 years in prison before exoneration and release.  The Innocence Project's full-time staff attorneys and Cardozo Law School clinic students provide direct representation or critical assistance in most of these cases.  The Innocence Project states on its website that groundbreaking use of DNA technology to free innocent people has provided irrefutable proof that wrongful convictions are not isolated or rare events but instead arise from systemic defects.  Now an independent nonprofit organization affiliated with Cardozo Law School, the Innocence Project's mission is to free innocent people who remain incarcerated and to bring substantive reform to the criminal justice system responsible for their unjust imprisonment. They get thousands of letters from wrongly convicted inmates every year.

==Teaching and speaking==

Neufeld taught trial advocacy at Fordham School of Law from 1988–1991.  Currently he teaches Cardozo law students within the Innocence Project clinic.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin N. Cardozo Law School's Innocence Project clinic website, http://www.cardozo.yu.edu/innocenceproject&lt;/ref&gt;  Neufeld has lectured throughout the world on the causes of wrongful convictions and appropriate remedies and specifically on the fundamental lack of scientific rigor in much of forensic science.

In 1995, he was appointed to serve on the New York State Commission on Forensic Science by then-Governor [[George Pataki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peter J. Neufeld |publisher=The Innocence Project |url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/Barry_C_Scheck__Peter_J_Neufeld.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130905015412/http%3A//www.innocenceproject.org/Content/Barry_C_Scheck__Peter_J_Neufeld.php |archivedate=2013-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, he was appointed by the U.S. Department of Justice to the National Commission on Forensic Science.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Departments of Justice and Commerce Name Experts to First-ever National Commission on Forensic Science," U.S. Department of Justice website, January 10, 2014 http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-departments-justice-and-commerce-name-experts-first-ever-national-commission-forensic&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2016, Neufeld continues to serve on both commissions.  He also chaired the Medical Committee of the Board of Trustees for the Montefiore Medical Center from 1995–2015.&lt;ref&gt;Montefiore Hospital website, Board of Trustees, http://www.montefiore.org/about-board-of-trustees&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polish''' (''język polski'' {{IPA-pl|jɛ̃zɨk ˈpɔlskʲi||Pl-język polski.ogg}}, ''polszczyzna'', or simply ''polski'') is a [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic language]] spoken primarily in [[Poland]] and is the [[first language|native language]] of the [[Poles]]. It belongs to the [[Lechitic languages|Lechitic]] subgroup of the [[West Slavic languages]] written in [[Latin script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/335581/Lekhitic-languages |title=Lekhitic languages &amp;#124; Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2015-01-08 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish is the [[official language]] of Poland, but it is also used by [[Polish diaspora|Polish minorities]] in other countries. There are over 50 million&lt;ref name="encyklopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="almanac"/&gt; Polish language speakers around the world and it is one of the official [[languages of the European Union]]. 

Polish is written with the standard [[Polish alphabet]], which has 9 additions to the letters of the basic Latin script (''ą'', ''ć'', ''ę'', ''ł'', ''ń'', ''ó'', ''ś'', ''ź'', ''ż''). Polish is closely related to [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]. The language currently has the largest number of speakers of the West Slavic group and is also the second most widely spoken [[Slavic language]].&lt;ref name="cactuslanguagetraining1"&gt;{{cite web|author=United States |url=http://www.cactuslanguagetraining.com/us/english/view/the-importance-of-polish-as-a-language-today/ |title=The importance of Polish as a language today&amp;nbsp;— Learn English your way |publisher=Cactus Language Training |date=2007-07-10 |accessdate=2011-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907172244/http://www.cactuslanguagetraining.com/us/english/view/the-importance-of-polish-as-a-language-today/ |archivedate=September 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ethnologue1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.org/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=size |title=Statistical Summaries |publisher=Ethnologue |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, Polish was known to be ''[[lingua franca]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=yRz0DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=lingua+franca+polish-lithuanian+commonwealth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hBXMjV1sNT&amp;sig=CuoKmNyUKUSfVbSUcf_Dt9UF3WY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwimgIj06fXeAhVGDywKHe-9DY0Q6AEwDXoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=lingua+franca+polish-lithuanian+commonwealth&amp;f=false|title="Multilingual Europe, Multilingual Europeans"|date=1 January 2012|publisher=BRILL|accessdate=28 November 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/publish/no15_ses/08_koyama.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; an important language, both diplomatically and academically in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. Today, Polish is spoken by over 38.5 million people as their first language in [[Poland]]. It is also spoken as a [[second language]] in northern [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], western parts of [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]], and central-western [[Lithuania]]. Because of the emigration from Poland during different time periods, most notably after [[World War II]], millions of Polish speakers can be found in countries such as [[Israel]], [[Australia]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[United States]] and [[New Zealand]].

==History==
Polish began to emerge as a distinct language around the 10th century, the process largely triggered by the establishment and development of the Polish state. [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], ruler of the Polans tribe from the [[Greater Poland]] region, united a few culturally and linguistically related tribes from the basins of the [[Vistula]] and [[Oder]] before eventually accepting baptism in 966. With Christianity, Poland also adopted the [[Latin alphabet]], which made it possible to write down Polish, until then existing only as a spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todaytranslations.com/language-history/polish/ |title=Polish Language History and Facts &amp;#124; Today Translations London, UK |publisher=Todaytranslations.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It is worth mentioning," writes [[Tomasz Kamusella]], "that Polish is the oldest, non-ecclesiastical, written Slavic language with a continuous tradition of literacy and official use, which has lasted unbroken from the 16th century to this day."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Kamusella |first= Tomasz |year= 2008 |title= The Politics of Language and Nationalism in Modern Central Europe |location= Basingstoke and New York, NY |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan |page= [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JzkWDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138 138] |isbn= 978-0-230-55070-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Book of Henryków.PNG|thumb|left|220px|The [[Book of Henryków]] is the earliest document to include a sentence written entirely in what can be interpreted as an [[Old Polish language]] - ''Day, ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai'' highlited in red]]

The precursor to modern Polish is the [[Old Polish language]]. Ultimately, Polish is thought to descend from the unattested [[Proto-Slavic]] language. Polish was a ''[[lingua franca]]'' from 1500–1700 in [[Central Europe|Central]] and small portions of [[Eastern Europe]], because of the political, cultural, scientific and military influence of the former [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ixmu8Iga7gC&amp;pg=PA194#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Language and Nationalism in Europe|last=Barbour|first=Stephen|last2=Carmichael|first2=Cathie|date=2000-12-14|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191584077|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Henryków]] (Polish: ''Księga henrykowska'', {{lang-la|Liber fundationis claustri Sancte Marie Virginis in Heinrichau}}), contains the earliest known sentence written in the Polish language: ''Day, ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai'' (pronounced originally as: ''Daj, uć ja pobrusza, a ti pocziwaj,'' modern Polish: ''Daj, niech ja pomielę, a ty odpoczywaj'' or ''Pozwól, że ja będę mełł, a ty odpocznij'', English: ''Come, let me grind, and you take a rest''), written around 1270.

The medieval recorder of this phrase, the Cistercian monk Peter of the Henryków monastery, noted that "Hoc est in polonico" ("This is in Polish").&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.fides.org.pl/publication/834 Digital version ''Book of Henryków'' in latin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara i Adam Podgórscy: Słownik gwar śląskich.

==Geographic distribution==
{{See also|Geographical distribution of Polish speakers}}
Poland is the most linguistically [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] European country; nearly 97% of Poland's citizens declare Polish as their [[first language]]. Elsewhere, [[Poles]] constitute large minorities in [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. Polish is the most widely used minority language in Lithuania's [[Vilnius County]] (26% of the population, according to the 2001 census results, with [[Vilnius]] having been part of Poland from 1922 until 1939) and is found elsewhere in southeastern Lithuania. In Ukraine it is most common in western [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]] and [[Volyn Oblast]]s, while in [[West Belarus]] it is used by the significant Polish minority, especially in the [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] and [[Grodno]] regions and in areas along the Lithuanian border. There are significant numbers of Polish speakers among [[Polish diaspora|Polish emigrants]] and their descendants in many other countries.

In the [[United States]], [[Polish Americans]] number more than 11 million but most of them cannot speak Polish fluently. According to the [[2000 United States Census]], 667,414 &lt;!-- directly from the Census table. --&gt; Americans of age five years and over reported Polish as the language spoken at home, which is about 1.4% of people who speak languages other than [[English language|English]], 0.25% of the US population, and 6% of the Polish-American population. The largest concentrations of Polish speakers reported in the census (over 50%) were found in three states: [[Illinois]] (185,749), [[New York (state)|New York]] (111,740), and [[New Jersey]] (74,663).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cen2000/phc-t20/tab05.pdf |format=PDF |title=Table 8. Detailed List of Languages Spoken at Home for the Population 5 Years and Over : By State |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enough people in these areas speak Polish that [[PNC Financial Services]] (which has a large number of branches in all of these areas) offer services available in Polish at all of their [[cash machine]]s in addition to [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pnc.com/en/personal-banking/banking/services/atm-layouts.html|title=PNC ATM Banking|last=|first=|date=|website=PNC|language=en|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2011 census there are now over 500,000 people in [[England]] and [[Wales]] who consider Polish to be their "main" language. In [[Canada]], there is a significant [[Polish Canadians|Polish Canadian population]]: There are 242,885 speakers of Polish according to the 2006 census, with a particular concentration in [[Toronto]] (91,810 speakers) and [[Montreal]].&lt;ref name="census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?ALEVEL%3D3%26APATH%3D3%26CATNO%3D%26DETAIL%3D0%26DIM%3D%26DS%3D99%26FL%3D0%26FREE%3D0%26GAL%3D0%26GC%3D99%26GK%3DNA%26GRP%3D1%26IPS%3D%26METH%3D0%26ORDER%3D1%26PID%3D89189%26PTYPE%3D88971%26RL%3D0%26S%3D1%26ShowAll%3DNo%26StartRow%3D1%26SUB%3D705%26Temporal%3D2006%26Theme%3D70%26VID%3D0%26VNAMEE%3D%26VNAMEF%3D |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016163022/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?ALEVEL=3&amp;APATH=3&amp;CATNO=&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=&amp;DS=99&amp;FL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;GAL=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;GRP=1&amp;IPS=&amp;METH=0&amp;ORDER=1&amp;PID=89189&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;RL=0&amp;S=1&amp;ShowAll=No&amp;StartRow=1&amp;SUB=705&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;Theme=70&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF= |archivedate=October 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographical distribution of the Polish language was greatly affected by the [[territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II]] and [[Polish population transfers (1944–46)]]. Poles settled in the "[[Recovered Territories]]" in the west and north, which had previously been mostly [[German language|German]]-speaking. Some Poles remained in the previously Polish-ruled territories in the east that were annexed by the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], resulting in the present-day Polish-speaking minorities in Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine, although many Poles were expelled or emigrated from those areas to areas within Poland's new borders. To the east of Poland, the most significant Polish minority lives in a long, narrow strip along either side of the [[Lithuania]]-[[Belarus]] border. Meanwhile, the [[flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)]], as well as the [[population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine|expulsion of Ukrainians]] and [[Operation Vistula]], the 1947 forced resettlement of Ukrainian minorities to the Recovered Territories in the west of the country, contributed to the country's linguistic homogeneity.

==Dialects==
{{Main|Dialects of Polish}}
[[File:Modlitwy drukowane po polsku w r. 1475.JPG|thumb|The oldest printed text in Polish &amp;ndash; Statuta synodalia Episcoporum Wratislaviensis printed in 1475 in [[Wrocław]] by Kasper Elyan.]]
[[File:Polish-alphabet.png|thumb|The Polish alphabet contains 32 letters. Q, V and X are not used in the Polish language.]]
The Polish language became far more homogeneous in the second half of the 20th century, in part due to the mass migration of several million Polish citizens from the eastern to the western part of the country after the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] annexation of the [[Kresy]] (Eastern Borderlands) in 1939, and the annexation of [[Former eastern territories of Germany|former German territory]] after World War II. This tendency toward a homogeneity also stems from the vertically integrated nature of the [[Polish People's Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wprost.pl/tygodnik/83016/Narod-niedokonczony.html|title=Naród niedokończony|first=Zdzisław|last=Krasnodębski|date=20 November 2005|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inhabitants of different regions of Poland {{as of | 2008 | alt = still}} speak "standard" Polish somewhat differently, although the differences between regional dialects appear slight. First-language speakers of Polish have no trouble understanding each other, and non-native speakers may have difficulty distinguishing regional variations.

Polish is normally described as consisting of four or five main dialects:
* [[Greater Poland|Greater Polish]], spoken in the west
* [[Lesser Poland|Lesser Polish]], spoken in the south and southeast
* [[Masovian dialect|Masovian]], spoken throughout the central and eastern parts of the country
* [[Silesian language|Silesian]], spoken in the southwest (also considered a separate language, see comment below)

[[Kashubian language|Kashubian]], spoken in [[Pomerania]] west of [[Gdańsk]] on the [[Baltic Sea]], is often considered a fifth dialect. It contains a number of features not found elsewhere in Poland, e.g. nine distinct oral vowels (vs. the five of standard Polish) and (in the northern dialects) phonemic word stress, an archaic feature preserved from [[Common Slavic]] times and not found anywhere else among the [[West Slavic languages]]. However, it "lacks most of the linguistic and social determinants of language-hood".&lt;ref&gt;''The Slavic Languages'', CUP&lt;/ref&gt;

Many linguistic sources about the Slavic languages describe Silesian as a dialect of Polish.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Sussex and Paul Cubberley (2006). ''The Slavic Languages''. Cambridge University Press. P. 530.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Rothstein (1994). "Polish". ''The Slavonic Languages'', edited by [[Bernard Comrie]] and Greville G. Corbett. Routledge. Pp. 754–756.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many Silesians consider themselves a separate ethnicity and have been advocating for the recognition of a Silesian language. According to the last official census in Poland in 2011, over half a million people declared Silesian as their native language. Many sociolinguistic sources (e.g. by [[Tomasz Kamusella]],&lt;ref&gt;"Silesia and Central European Nationalisms", 2007. West Lafayette, IN: Purdue University Press {{ISBN|978-1-55753-371-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnieszka Pianka, Alfred F. Majewicz,&lt;ref&gt;["Języki świata i ich klasyfikowanie"] (en: "Languages of the world and their classification"), [[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|Polish Scientific Publishers]], Warszawa 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Tomasz Wicherkiewicz)&lt;ref&gt;"Ekspertyza naukowa dr Tomasza Wicherkiewicza", Language Policy and the Laboratory for Research on Minority, Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; assume that extralinguistic criteria decide whether something is a language or a dialect of the language: users of speech or/and political decisions, and this is dynamic (i.e. it changes over time). Also, language organizations such as [[SIL International]]&lt;ref name="SIL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=szl |title=ISO documentation of Silesian language |publisher=[[SIL International]] |accessdate=2015-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003061821/http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=szl |archivedate=October 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and resources for the academic field of linguistics such as [[Ethnologue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.org/codes/LanguageCodes.tab |title=List of languages with ISO codes |work=[[Ethnologue]] |publisher=[[SIL International]] |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linguist List]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://multitree.linguistlist.org/codes/szl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602110608/http://multitree.linguistlist.org/codes/szl|date=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others, for example the [[Ministry of Administration and Digitization (Poland)|Ministry of Administration and Digitization]]&lt;ref name="MoAaD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WDU20120000309 |title=Internetowy System Aktów Prawnych |publisher=Isap.sejm.gov.pl |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognized the Silesian language. In July 2007, the Silesian language was recognized by an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], and was attributed an ISO code of szl.

Some additional characteristic but less widespread regional dialects include:
# The distinctive dialect of the [[Gorals#language|Gorals]] (''Góralski'') occurs in the mountainous area bordering the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]. The Gorals ("Highlanders") take great pride in their culture and the dialect. It exhibits some cultural influences from the [[Vlachs|Vlach]] shepherds who migrated from [[Wallachia]] (southern Romania) in the 14th–17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/rizne/magocie.htm|title=The Rusyn Question|author=Magosic, Paul Robert|year=2005|accessdate=2008-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[:pl:Gwara poznańska|Poznanski dialect]], spoken in [[Poznań]] and to some extent in the whole region of the former [[Prussian Partition]] (excluding [[Upper Silesia]]), with noticeable German influences.
# In the northern and western (formerly German) regions where Poles from the territories annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] resettled after World War II, the older generation speaks a dialect of Polish characteristic of the [[Kresy]] that includes a longer pronunciation of vowels.
# Poles living in Lithuania (particularly in the [[Vilnius]] region), in Belarus (particularly the northwest), and in the northeast of Poland continue to speak the [[Kresy|Eastern Borderlands]] dialect, which sounds "slushed" (in Polish described as ''zaciąganie z ruska'', "speaking with a Ruthenian drawl") and is easily distinguishable.
# Some city dwellers, especially the less affluent population, had their own distinctive dialects - for example, the [[Warsaw dialect]], still spoken by some of the population of [[Praga]] on the eastern bank of the [[Vistula]]. (Praga remained the only part of Warsaw where the population survived World War II relatively intact.) However, these city dialects are {{as of | 2008 | alt = now}} mostly extinct due to assimilation with standard Polish.
# Many Poles living in emigrant communities (for example, in the USA), whose families left Poland just after World War II, retain a number of minor features of Polish vocabulary as spoken in the first half of the 20th century that now sound archaic to contemporary visitors from Poland.

==Phonology==
{{Main|Polish phonology}}
[[File:Pl-Deflegmator-article.ogg|thumb|Spoken Polish in a neutral informative tone]]
===Vowels and consonants===
Polish has six oral vowels (all [[monophthong]]s) and two [[nasal vowel]]s. The oral vowels are {{IPAl-pl|i}} (spelled ''i''), {{IPAl-pl|y}} (spelled ''y''), {{IPAl-pl|e}} (spelled ''e''), {{IPAl-pl|a}} (spelled ''a''), {{IPAl-pl|o}} (spelled ''o'') and {{IPAl-pl|u}} (spelled ''u'' or ''[[ó]]''). The nasal vowels are {{IPAl-pl|ę}} (spelled ''[[ę]]'') and {{IPAl-pl|ą}} (spelled ''[[ą]]'').

The Polish [[consonant]] system shows more complexity: its characteristic features include the series of [[affricate consonant|affricate]] and [[palatal consonant]]s that resulted from four [[Proto-Slavic]] [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]]s and two further palatalizations that took place in Polish and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]. The full set of consonants, together with their most common spellings, can be presented as follows (although other phonological analyses exist):
* [[stop consonant|stops]] {{IPAl-pl|p}} (''p''), {{IPAl-pl|b}} (''b''), {{IPAl-pl|t}} (''t''), {{IPAl-pl|d}} (''d''), {{IPAl-pl|k}} (''k''), {{IPAl-pl|ɡ}} (''g''), and the [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] forms {{IPAl-pl|ki}} (''ki'') and {{IPAl-pl|gi}} (''gi'')
* [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] {{IPAl-pl|f}} (''f''), {{IPAl-pl|w}} (''w''), {{IPAl-pl|s}} (''s''), {{IPAl-pl|z}} (''z''), {{IPAl-pl|sz}} (''sz''), {{IPAl-pl|ż}} (''[[ż]], rz''), the [[Alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatals]] {{IPAl-pl|ś}} (''[[ś]], si'') and {{IPAl-pl|ź}} (''[[ź]], zi''), and {{IPAl-pl|h}} (''ch, h'') and {{IPAl-pl|hi}} (''chi, hi'')
* [[affricate consonant|affricates]] {{IPAl-pl|c}} (''c''), {{IPAl-pl|dz}} (''dz''), {{IPAl-pl|cz}} (''cz''), {{IPAl-pl|dż}} (''dż''), {{IPAl-pl|ć}} (''[[ć]], ci''), {{IPAl-pl|dź}} (''dź, dzi'') (these are written here without [[tie (typography)|ties]] for browser display compatibility, although Polish does distinguish between affricates as in ''czy'', and stop&amp;ndash;fricative clusters as in ''trzy'')
* [[nasal consonant|nasals]] {{IPAl-pl|m}} (''m''), {{IPAl-pl|n}} (''n''), {{IPAl-pl|ń}} (''ń, ni'')
* [[Approximant consonant|approximants]] {{IPAl-pl|l}} (''l''), {{IPAl-pl|j}} (''j''), {{IPAl-pl|ł}} (''ł'')
* [[trill consonant|trill]] {{IPAl-pl|r}} (''r'')

Main [[allophones]] (in black) are in broad transcription, whereas positional allophones (in red and green) are in narrow transcription. Allophones with red dots appear in palatal contexts. The central vowel [ɜ] is an unstressed allophone of /ɛ, ɔ, a/ in certain contexts]]

[[Neutralization (linguistics)|Neutralization]] occurs between [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]]–[[voicelessness|voiceless]] consonant pairs in certain environments: at the end of words (where devoicing occurs), and in certain consonant clusters (where [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]] occurs). For details, see ''[[Polish phonology#Voicing and devoicing|Voicing and devoicing]]'' in the article on Polish phonology.

Most Polish words are [[paroxytone]]s (that is, the [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] falls on the second-to-last syllable of a polysyllabic word), although there are exceptions.

===Consonant distribution===
Polish permits complex consonant clusters, which historically often arose from the disappearance of [[yer]]s. Polish can have word-initial and word-medial clusters of up to four consonants, whereas word-final clusters can have up to five consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polish|url=http://www.phonetics.ucla.edu/appendix/languages/polish/polish.html|author=|date=|website=UCLA Phonetics Lab data|publisher=UCLA Phonetics Laboratory, [[University of California, Los Angeles]]|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920090539/http://phonetics.ucla.edu/appendix/languages/polish/polish.html|archivedate=20 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such clusters can be found in words such as ''bezwzględny'' {{IPA|[bɛzˈvzɡlɛndnɨ]}} ('absolute' or 'heartless', 'ruthless'), ''źdźbło'' {{IPA|[ˈʑd͡ʑbwɔ]}} ('blade of grass'), {{Audio|Pl-wstrząs.ogg|''wstrząs''|help=no}} {{IPA|[ˈfstʂɔw̃s]}} ('shock'), and ''krnąbrność'' {{IPA|[ˈkrnɔmbrnɔɕt͡ɕ]}} ('disobedience'). A popular Polish [[tongue-twister]] (from a verse by [[Jan Brzechwa]]) is {{Audio|Polish Tongue twister - Chrząszcz - 2.ogg|''W Szczebrzeszynie chrząszcz brzmi w trzcinie''|help=no}} {{IPA|[fʂt͡ʂɛbʐɛˈʂɨɲɛ ˈxʂɔw̃ʂt͡ʂ ˈbʐmi fˈtʂt͡ɕiɲɛ]}} ('In [[Szczebrzeszyn]] a beetle buzzes in the reed').

Unlike languages such as [[Czech language|Czech]], Polish does not have [[syllabic consonant]]s – the nucleus of a [[syllable]] is always a vowel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4178926|title=Nonsyllabic Analysis of Voice Assimilation in Polish|first=Jerzy|last=Rubach|date=28 November 1996|publisher=|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|volume=27|issue=1|pages=69–110|accessdate=28 November 2018|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consonant {{IPA|/j/}} is restricted to positions adjacent to a vowel. It also cannot precede ''i'' or ''y''.

===Prosody===

The predominant [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] pattern in Polish is penultimate stress – in a word of more than one syllable, the next-to-last syllable is stressed. Alternating preceding syllables carry secondary stress, e.g. in a four-syllable word, where the primary stress is on the third syllable, there will be secondary stress on the first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gussmann|2007|p=8}}, deferring to {{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|Booij|1985}} for further discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each vowel represents one syllable, although the letter ''i'' normally does not represent a vowel when it precedes another vowel (it represents {{IPA|/j/}}, palatalization of the preceding consonant, or both depending on analysis). Also the letters ''u'' and ''i'' sometimes represent only semivowels when they follow another vowel, as in ''autor'' {{IPA|/ˈawtɔr/}} ('author'), mostly in loanwords (so not in native ''nauka'' {{IPA|/naˈu.ka/}} 'science, the act of learning', for example, nor in nativized ''Mateusz'' {{IPA|/maˈte.uʂ/}}  'Matthew').

[[File:Styl urzedowy - Polish sign.jpg|thumb|right|A formal-tone informative sign in Polish, with a composition of vowels and consonants and a mixture of long, medium and short [[syllables]]]]  

Some [[loanword]]s, particularly from the [[Classical languages]], have the stress on the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable. For example, ''fizyka'' ({{IPA|/ˈfizɨka/}}) ('physics') is stressed on the first syllable. This may lead to a rare phenomenon of minimal pairs differing only in stress placement, for example ''muzyka'' {{IPA|/ˈmuzɨka/}} 'music' vs. ''muzyka'' {{IPA|/muˈzɨka/}} - genitive singular of ''muzyk'' 'musician'. When additional syllables are added to such words through [[inflection]] or [[suffix]]ation, the stress normally becomes regular. For example, ''uniwersytet'' ({{IPA|/uɲiˈvɛrsɨtɛt/}}, 'university') has irregular stress on the third (or antepenultimate) syllable, but the genitive ''uniwersytetu'' ({{IPA|/uɲivɛrsɨˈtɛtu/}}) and derived adjective ''uniwersytecki'' ({{IPA|/uɲivɛrsɨˈtɛt͡skʲi/}}) have regular stress on the penultimate syllables. Over time, loanwords become nativized to have penultimate stress.{{sfnp|Gussmann|2007|p=9}}

Another class of exceptions is verbs with the conditional endings ''-by, -bym, -byśmy'', etc. These endings are not counted in determining the position of the stress; for example, '''''zro'''biłbym'' ('I would do') is stressed on the first syllable, and ''zro'''bi'''libyśmy'' ('we would do') on the second. According to prescriptive grammars, the same applies to the first and second person plural past tense endings ''-śmy, -ście'', although this rule is often ignored in colloquial speech (so ''zro'''bi'''liśmy'' 'we did' is said to be correctly stressed on the second syllable, although in practice it is commonly stressed on the third as ''zrobi'''li'''śmy'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://phonetik.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/uploads/tx_sibibtex/Oliver_Grice_ICPhS2003-1_01.pdf Phonetics and Phonology of lexical stress in Polish verbs], Dominika Oliver, Martine Grice, Institute of Phonetics, Saarland University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; These irregular stress patterns are explained by the fact that these endings are detachable [[clitic]]s rather than true verbal inflections: for example, instead of '''''ko'''go zoba'''czy'''liście?'' ('whom did you see?') it is possible to say '''''ko'''goście zoba'''czy'''li?'' – here ''kogo'' retains its usual stress (first syllable) in spite of the attachment of the clitic. Reanalysis of the endings as inflections when attached to verbs causes the different colloquial stress patterns.

Some common word combinations are stressed as if they were a single word. This applies in particular to many combinations of preposition plus a personal pronoun, such as '''''do''' niej'' ('to her'), '''''na''' nas'' ('on us'), ''prze'''ze''' mnie'' ('because of me'), all stressed on the bolded syllable.

==Orthography==
{{Main|Polish orthography|Polish Braille}}
The [[Polish alphabet]] derives from the [[Latin script]], but includes certain additional letters formed using [[diacritic]]s. The Polish alphabet was one of three major forms of Latin-based orthography developed for Slavic languages, the others being [[Czech orthography]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian orthography]], the latter being a 19th-century invention trying to make a compromise between the first two. [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] uses a Polish-based system, [[Slovak language|Slovak]] uses a Czech-based system, and [[Slovene language|Slovene]] follows the Croatian one; the [[Sorbian languages]] blend the Polish and the Czech ones.

The diacritics used in the Polish alphabet are the ''kreska'' (graphically similar to the [[acute accent]]) in the letters ''ć, ń, ó, ś, ź'' and through the letter in ''ł''; the ''kropka'' (superior dot) in the letter ''ż'', and the ''[[ogonek]]'' ("little tail") in the letters ''ą, ę''. The letters ''q, v, x'' are often not considered part of the Polish alphabet; they are used only in foreign words and names.

Polish orthography is largely [[phoneme|phonemic]]—there is a consistent correspondence between letters (or [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s and [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]s) and phonemes (for exceptions see below). The letters of the alphabet and their normal phonemic values are listed in the following table.

Voiced consonant letters frequently come to represent voiceless sounds (as shown in the tables); this occurs at the end of words and in certain clusters, due to the neutralization mentioned in the ''[[#Phonology|Phonology]]'' section above. Occasionally also voiceless consonant letters can represent voiced sounds in clusters.

The spelling rule for the palatal sounds {{IPAl-pl|ś}}, {{IPAl-pl|ź}}, {{IPAl-pl|ć}}, {{IPAl-pl|dź}} and {{IPAl-pl|ń}} is as follows: before the vowel ''i'' the plain letters ''s, z, c, dz, n'' are used; before other vowels the combinations ''si, zi, ci, dzi, ni'' are used; when not followed by a vowel the diacritic forms ''ś, ź, ć, dź, ń'' are used. For example, the ''s'' in ''siwy'' ("grey-haired"), the ''si'' in ''siarka'' ("sulphur") and the ''ś'' in  ''święty'' ("holy") all represent the sound {{IPAl-pl|ś}}. The exceptions to the above rule are certain loanwords from Latin, Italian, French, Russian or English—where ''s'' before ''i'' is pronounced as ''s'', e.g. ''sinus'', ''sinologia'', ''do re mi fa sol la si do'', ''Saint-Simon i saint-simoniści'', ''Sierioża'', ''Siergiej'', ''Singapur'', ''singiel''. In other loanwords the vowel ''i'' is changed to ''y'', e.g. ''Syria'', ''Sybir'', ''synchronizacja'', ''Syrakuzy''.

The following table shows the correspondence between the sounds and spelling:

[[Digraph (orthography)|Digraphs]] and [[Trigraph (orthography)|trigraphs]] are used:

|}

Similar principles apply to {{IPAl-pl|ki}}, {{IPAl-pl|gi}}, {{IPAl-pl|hi}} and {{IPA|[[Palatalization (phonetics)|/lʲ/]]}}, except that these can only occur before vowels, so the spellings are ''k, g, (c)h, l'' before ''i'', and ''ki, gi, (c)hi, li'' otherwise. Most Polish speakers, however, do not consider palatalisation of ''k, g, (c)h'' or ''l'' as creating new sounds.

Except in the cases mentioned above, the letter ''i'' if followed by another vowel in the same word usually represents {{IPAl-pl|j}}, yet a palatalisation of the previous consonant is always assumed.

The letters ''ą'' and ''ę'', when followed by plosives and affricates, represent an oral vowel followed by a nasal consonant, rather than a nasal vowel. For example, ''ą'' in ''dąb'' ("oak") is pronounced {{IPAc-pl|//|o|m}}, and ''ę'' in ''tęcza'' ("rainbow") is pronounced {{IPAc-pl|//|e|n}} (the nasal assimilates to the following consonant). When followed by ''l'' or ''ł'' (for example ''przyjęli'', ''przyjęły''),  ''ę'' is pronounced as just ''e''. When ''ę'' is at the end of the word it is often pronounced as just {{IPAc-pl|//|e}}.

Note that, depending on the word, the phoneme {{IPAl-pl|h}} can be spelt ''h'' or ''ch'', the phoneme {{IPAl-pl|ż}} can be spelt ''ż'' or ''rz'', and {{IPAl-pl|u}} can be spelt ''u'' or ''ó''. In several cases it determines the meaning, for example: ''może'' ("maybe") and  ''morze'' ("sea").

In occasional words, letters that normally form a digraph are pronounced separately. For example, ''rz'' represents {{IPAc-pl|//|r|z}}, not {{IPAl-pl|ż}}, in words like ''zamarzać'' ("freeze") and in the name ''[[Tarzan]]''.

Notice that doubled letters represent separate occurrences of the sound in question; for example ''Anna'' is pronounced {{IPAc-pl|//|a|n|ː|a}} in Polish (the double ''n'' is often pronounced as a lengthened single ''n'').

There are certain clusters where a written consonant would not be pronounced. For example, the ''ł'' in the words ''mógł'' ("could") and ''jabłko'' ("apple") might be omitted in ordinary speech, leading to the pronunciations ''muk'' and ''japko'' or ''jabko''.

== Grammar ==
{{main|Polish grammar}}
Polish is a highly [[inflected language]], with relatively free [[word order]], although the dominant arrangement is [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO). There are no [[article (grammar)|articles]], and subject pronouns are often [[Pro-drop language|dropped]].

[[Noun]]s belong to one of three [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine and neuter. A distinction is also made between [[animacy|animate]] and inanimate masculine nouns in the [[singular number|singular]], and between masculine personal and non-masculine-personal nouns in the [[plural]]. There are seven [[case (grammar)|case]]s: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative and vocative.

[[Adjective]]s agree with nouns in terms of gender, case and number. [[Attributive adjective]]s most commonly precede the noun, although in certain cases, especially in fixed phrases (like ''język polski'', "Polish (language)"), the noun may come first; the rule of thumb is that generic descriptive adjective normally precedes (e.g. ''piękny kwiat'', “beautiful flower”) while categorising adjective often follows the noun (e.g. ''węgiel kamienny'', “black 
coal”). Most short adjectives and their derived [[adverb]]s form [[comparative]]s and [[superlative]]s by inflection (the superlative is formed by prefixing ''naj-'' to the comparative).

[[Verb]]s are of imperfective or perfective [[aspect (grammar)|aspect]], often occurring in pairs. Imperfective verbs have a present tense, past tense, compound future tense (except for ''być'' "to be", which has a simple future ''będę'' etc., this in turn being used to form the compound future of other verbs), subjunctive/conditional (formed with the detachable particle ''by''), imperatives, an infinitive, present participle, present gerund and past participle. Perfective verbs have a simple future tense (formed like the present tense of imperfective verbs), past tense, subjunctive/conditional, imperatives, infinitive, present gerund and past participle. Conjugated verb forms agree with their subject in terms of person, number, and (in the case of past tense and subjunctive/conditional forms) gender.

[[Passive voice|Passive]]-type constructions can be made using the auxiliary ''być'' or ''zostać'' ("become") with the passive participle. There is also an impersonal construction where the active verb is used (in third person singular) with no subject, but with the reflexive pronoun ''się'' present to indicate a general, unspecified subject (as in ''pije się wódkę'' "vodka is drunk"—note that ''wódka'' appears in the accusative). A similar sentence type in the past tense uses the passive participle with the ending ''-o'', as in ''widziano ludzi'' ("people were seen"). As in other Slavic languages, there are also subjectless sentences formed using such words as ''można'' ("it is possible") together with an infinitive.

[[Yes-no question]]s (both direct and indirect) are formed by placing the word ''czy'' at the start. Negation uses the word ''nie'', before the verb or other item being negated; ''nie'' is still added before the verb even if the sentence also contains other negatives such as ''nigdy'' ("never") or ''nic'' ("nothing"), effectively creating a [[double negative]].

[[Cardinal number (linguistics)|Cardinal number]]s have a complex system of inflection and agreement. Zero and cardinal numbers higher than five (except for those ending with the digit 2, 3 or 4 but not ending with 12, 13 or 14) govern the [[genitive case]] rather than the nominative or accusative. Special forms of numbers ([[collective numeral]]s) are used with certain classes of noun, which include ''dziecko'' ("child") and [[plurale tantum|exclusively plural]] nouns such as ''drzwi'' ("door").

Polish has, over the centuries, borrowed a number of words from other languages. When borrowing, pronunciation was adapted to Polish phonemes and spelling was altered to match [[Polish orthography]]. In addition, word endings are liberally applied to almost any word to produce [[Verb|verbs]], [[Noun|nouns]], [[Adjective|adjectives]], as well as adding the appropriate endings for cases of nouns, adjectives, [[diminutive]]s, double-diminutives, [[augmentative]]s, etc.

Depending on the historical period, borrowing has proceeded from various languages. Notable influences have been [[Latin]] (9th–18th centuries), [[Czech language|Czech]] (10th and 14th–15th centuries), [[Italian language|Italian]] (15th–16th centuries), [[French language|French]] (18th–19th centuries), German (13–15th and 18th–20th centuries), [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (14th–16th centuries) and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (17th century). Currently, English words are the most common imports to Polish.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://e-polish.eu/blog/zapozyczenia-w-jezyku-polskim/|title=Zapożyczenia w języku polskim|first=SJO|last=Glossa|website=e-polish.eu|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin language, for a very long time the only official language of the Polish state, has had a great influence on Polish.  Many Polish words (''rzeczpospolita'' from ''res publica'') were direct borrowings from Latin. [[Latin]] was known to a larger or smaller degree by most of the numerous [[szlachta]] in the 16th to 18th centuries (and it continued to be extensively taught at secondary schools until [[World War II]]). Apart from dozens of loanwords, its influence can also be seen in a number of verbatim Latin phrases in [[Polish literature]] (especially from the 19th century and earlier).

During the 12th and 13th centuries, Mongolian words were brought to the Polish language during wars with the armies of [[Genghis Khan]] and his descendants, e.g. ''dzida'' (spear) and ''szereg'' (a line or row).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Words from [[Czech language|Czech]], an important influence during the 10th and 14th–15th centuries include ''[[sejm]]'', ''hańba'' and ''brama''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1518, the Polish king [[Sigismund I of Poland|Sigismund I the Old]] married [[Bona Sforza]], the niece of the Holy Roman emperor Maximilian, who introduced Italian cuisine to Poland, especially vegetables.&lt;ref name="ciekawostkihistoryczne.pl"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ciekawostkihistoryczne.pl/2014/11/07/czy-bona-sforza-naprawde-sprowadzila-do-polski-kapuste-i-kalafior/|title=Czy Bona Sforza naprawdę sprowadziła do Polski kapustę i kalafior?|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, words from Italian include ''pomidor'' from "pomodoro" (tomato), ''kalafior'' from "cavolfiore" (cauliflower), and ''pomarańcza'', a portmanteau from Italian "pomo" ([[pome]]) plus "arancio" (orange). A later word of Italian origin is ''autostrada'' (from Italian "autostrada", highway).&lt;ref name="ciekawostkihistoryczne.pl"/&gt;

In the 18th century, with the rising prominence of France in Europe, [[French language|French]] supplanted Latin as an important source of words. Some French borrowings also date from the Napoleonic era, when the Poles were enthusiastic supporters of [[Napoleon]]. Examples include ''ekran'' (from French "écran", screen), ''abażur'' ("abat-jour", lamp shade), ''rekin'' ("requin", shark), ''meble'' ("meuble", furniture), ''bagaż'' ("bagage", luggage), ''walizka'' ("valise", suitcase), ''fotel'' ("fauteuil", armchair), ''plaża'' ("plage", beach) and ''koszmar'' ("cauchemar", nightmare). Some place names have also been adapted from French, such as the [[Warsaw]] borough of [[Żoliborz]] ("joli bord" = beautiful riverside), as well as the town of [[Żyrardów]] (from the name [[Philippe de Girard|Girard]], with the Polish suffix -ów attached to refer to the founder of the town).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visit.zyrardow.pl/pol/2p|title=Historia Żyrardowa|website=www.visit.zyrardow.pl|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pink Birkin bag.jpg|thumb|Common [[handbag]] in Polish is called a ''torba'', a word directly derived from the [[Turkish language]]. Turkish loanwords are common as Poland bordered the [[Ottoman Empire]] for centuries]]

Many words were borrowed from the [[German language]] from the sizable German population in Polish cities during medieval times. German words found in the Polish language are often connected with trade, the building industry, civic rights and city life. Some words were assimilated verbatim, for example ''handel'' (trade) and ''dach'' (roof); others are pronounced the same, but differ in writing ''schnur''—''sznur'' (cord). As a result of being neighbours with Germany, Polish has many German expressions which have become literally translated ([[calques]]). The regional [[dialect]]s of [[Upper Silesia]] and [[Masuria]] (Modern Polish [[East Prussia]]) have noticeably more German loanwords than other [[Dialect|dialects]].

The contacts with Ottoman Turkey in the 17th century brought many new words, some of them still in use, such as: ''jar'' ("yar" deep valley), ''szaszłyk'' ("şişlik" shish kebab), ''filiżanka'' ("fincan" cup), ''arbuz'' ("karpuz" watermelon), ''dywan'' ("divan" carpet),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/68/K0056800.html |title=kielbasa.

From the founding of the Kingdom of Poland in 1025 through the early years of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth created in 1569, Poland was the most tolerant country of Jews in Europe. Known as the "[[Heaven for the nobles, Purgatory for the townspeople, Hell for the peasants, and Paradise for the Jews|paradise for the Jews]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypcWuuGVvX8C&amp;pg=PA30|title=A History of East European Jews|last=Haumann|first=Heiko|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=9789639241268|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://culture.pl/en/article/a-virtual-visit-to-the-museum-of-the-history-of-polish-jews|title=A Virtual Visit to the Museum of the History of Polish Jews|work=Culture.pl|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became a shelter for persecuted and expelled European Jewish communities and the home to the world's largest Jewish community of the time. As a result, many Polish words come from [[Yiddish]], spoken by the large [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jewish]] population that existed until the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. Borrowed Yiddish words include ''bachor'' (an unruly boy or child), ''bajzel'' (slang for mess), ''belfer'' (slang for teacher), ''ciuchy'' (slang for clothing), ''cymes'' (slang for very tasty food), ''geszeft'' (slang for business), ''kitel'' (slang for apron), ''machlojka'' (slang for scam), ''mamona'' (money), ''manele'' (slang for oddments), ''myszygene'' (slang for lunatic), ''pinda'' (slang for girl, pejoratively), ''plajta'' (slang for bankruptcy), ''rejwach'' (noise), ''szmal'' (slang for money), and ''trefny'' (dodgy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.academia.edu/31168653/Wp%C5%82yw_j%C4%99zyk%C3%B3w_%C5%BCydowskich_na_j%C4%99zyk_polski|title=Wpływ języków żydowskich na język polski|first=Katarzyna |last=Martinovic|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountain dialects of the [[Gorals|Górale]] in southern Poland, have quite a number of words borrowed from [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (e.g. ''baca'', ''gazda'', ''juhas'', ''hejnał'') and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as a result of historical contacts with Hungarian-dominated [[Slovakia]] and Wallachian herders who travelled north along the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polskiwdwunastce.edu.pl/12-wiedza-o-jezyku/99-historia-zapozyczen|title=Historia zapożyczeń|first=Super|last=User|website=polskiwdwunastce.edu.pl|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[grypsera|Thieves' slang]] includes such words as ''kimać'' (to sleep) or ''majcher'' (knife) of Greek origin, considered then unknown to the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.academia.edu/31283378/Kilka_uwag_o_socjolekcie_przest%C4%99pczym_polszczyzny_przedwojennego_Lwowa_Socjolingwistyka_XXX_2016|title=Kilka uwag o socjolekcie przestępczym polszczyzny przedwojennego Lwowa, &amp;quot;Socjolingwistyka&amp;quot; XXX, 2016|first=Maciej|last=Rak|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent loanwords come primarily from the [[English language]], mainly those that have [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]] roots, for example ''komputer'' (computer), ''korupcja'' (from 'corruption', but sense restricted to 'bribery'), etc. Concatenation of parts of words (e.g. ''auto-moto''), which is not native to Polish but common in English, for example, is also sometimes used.  When borrowing English words, Polish often changes their spelling. For example, Latin suffix '-tio' corresponds to ''-cja''. To make the word plural, ''-cja'' becomes ''-cje''. Examples of this include ''inauguracja'' (inauguration), ''dewastacja'' (devastation), ''recepcja'' (reception), ''konurbacja'' (conurbation) and ''konotacje'' (connotations). Also, the digraph ''qu'' becomes ''kw'' (''kwadrant'' = quadrant; ''kworum'' = quorum).

==Loanwords from Polish==
[[File:Fishing - The Noun Project.svg|thumb|right|There are numerous words in both Polish and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish (Jewish)]] languages which are near-identical due to the large Jewish minority that once inhabited Poland. An example includes a [[fishing rod]], ווענטקע (ventke), borrowed directly from Polish ''wędka'']]
The Polish language has influenced others. Particular influences appear in other Slavic languages and in [[History of the Germans in Poland|German]]&amp;nbsp;— due to their proximity and shared borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/rbph_0035-0818_2010_num_88_3_7805|title=Polish|first1=Katarzyna|last1=Dziubalska-Kołaczyk|first2=Bogdan|last2=Walczak|date=28 November 2018|publisher=|journal=Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire|volume=88|issue=3|pages=817–840|accessdate=28 November 2018|doi=10.3406/rbph.2010.7805}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of loanwords include German ''Grenze'' (border),&lt;ref&gt;https://realpoland.eu/polish-language/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans]] ''grens'' from Polish ''granica''; German ''Peitzker'' from Polish ''piskorz'' (weatherfish); German ''Zobel'', French ''zibeline'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''sabel'', and English ''sable'' from Polish ''soból''; and ''[[ogonek]]'' ("little tail")&amp;nbsp;— the word describing a diacritic hook-sign added below some letters in various alphabets. "[[:pl:Szmata|Szmata]]," a Polish, Slovak and [[Rusyn language|Ruthenian]] word for "mop" or "rag" became part of [[Yiddish]].

There is a substantial number of Polish words which officially became part of Yiddish, once the main language of European [[Jews]]. These include basic items, objects or terms such as a [[Bun|bread bun]] (Polish ''bułka'', Yiddish בולקע ''bulke''), a [[fishing rod]] (''wędka'', ווענטקע ''ventke''), an [[oak]] (''dąb'', דעמב ''demb''), a [[meadow]] (''łąka'', לאָנקע ''lonke''), a [[moustache]] (''wąsy'', וואָנצעס ''vontses'') and a [[bladder]] (''pęcherz'', פּענכער ''penkher'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://culture.pl/en/article/how-much-polish-is-there-in-yiddish-and-how-much-yiddish-is-there-in-polish|title=How Much Polish Is There in Yiddish (and How Much Yiddish Is There in Polish)?|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Quite a few culinary loanwords exist in German and in other languages, some of which describe distinctive features of Polish cuisine. These include German and English ''[[Quark (dairy product)|Quark]]'' from ''twaróg'' (a kind of fresh cheese) and German ''Gurke'', English ''gherkin'' from ''ogórek'' (cucumber). The word ''[[pierogi]]'' (Polish dumplings) has spread internationally, as well as ''[[pączki]]'' (Polish donuts)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eater.com/2015/2/17/8055779/paczki-fat-tuesday-detroit-chicago|title=What Are Paczki and Why Is Everyone Freaking Out About Them?|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and kiełbasa (sausage, e.g. ''kolbaso'' in [[Esperanto]]). As far as ''pierogi'' concerned, the original Polish word is already in plural (sing. ''pieróg'', plural ''pierogi''; stem ''pierog-'', plural ending ''-i''; NB. ''o'' becomes ''ó'' in a closed syllable, like here in singular), yet it is commonly used with the English plural ending ''-s'' in Canada and United States of America, ''pierogis'', thus making it a "double plural". A similar situation happened in the opposite direction to the Polish loanword from English ''czipsy'' ("potato chips")—from English ''chips'' being already plural in the original (''chip'' + ''-s''), yet it has obtained the Polish plural ending ''-y''.

The word ''[[spruce]]'' entered the English language from the Polish name of [[Prussia|Prusy]] (a historical region, today part of [[Poland]]). It became ''spruce'' because in Polish, ''z Prus'', sounded like "spruce" in English (transl. "from [[Prussia]]") and was a generic term for commodities brought to England by [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] merchants and because the tree was believed to have come from Polish Ducal Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=spruce |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can be argued that the word is actually derived from the [[Old French]] term ''Pruce'', meaning literally Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/spruce#etymonline_v_21904|title=spruce - Origin and meaning of spruce by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Romané''''' is a Chilean soap opera ([[telenovela]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Productora hará versión mexicana de teleserie "Romané" |url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/p4_noticias/site/artic/20040328/pags/20040328114808.html |work=[[Radio Cooperativa]] |date=28 March 2004 |accessdate=4 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that was first aired on March 6, 2000 as part of the first semester prime-time lineup of soap operas on TVN. It competed against Canal 13’s ''Sabor A Ti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Romané", novela de exportación |url=http://www.mercurioantofagasta.cl/site/edic/20020713204117/pags/20020713215429.html |work=[[El Mercurio]] |date=14 July 2002 |accessdate=4 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The last time Jovanka Antich ([[Claudia Di Girólamo]]) was in [[Chile]], she was a teenager and had a secret, torrid affair with Raphael Dominguez ([[Francisco Melo]]) the son of a local well-to-do family.  The affair ended badly, with both of them believing that the other betrayed them when really it was Raphael’s mother Victoria North ([[Marés González]]) with the help of the power hungry gypsy Drago ([[José Soza]]) who tricked the young lovers into hating each other and separating.

The day they had planned to run away together Raphael doesn’t show and Jovanka leaves Mejillones alone never to tell him she is pregnant.  She ends up in Spain where she has a baby girl and marries a wealthy and good gypsy. They adopt two other girls, and the three of them grow up believing they all adopted.

Jovanka has now returned to Chile, with her daughters and now a widow, after 25 years to attend her father’s wedding. Her father, Melquíades ([[Héctor Noguera]]) has brought his whole tribe with him to Mejillones where he plans on marrying the young beauty Milenka California ([[Blanca Lewin]]). Jovanka finds herself once again in this town that brings back so many memories.

Many of the townspeople like Victoria North have an adverse hatred and prejudice towards gypsies, but the town itself is doing poorly with many businesses on the verge of bankruptcy, and the arrival of the gypsies will change all that. It's not long before Jovanka runs into Raphael again, and Victoria, afraid that she'll be found out, comes to tell her to leave. Remembering all the pain of the past,  still hurt and humiliated from Raphael’s abandonment, this only provokes Jovanka to shout out for the whole town to hear and know that the day Raphael Dominguez dies she will share her fortune and gold with everyone in the town.

From here is where things get complicated. People start attempting plots against Raphael. Victoria and Drago once again plot together to get rid of Jovanka. And Drago has his own plans to get rid of his best friend Melquiades so that he can become the leader of the tribe.  Jovanka meanwhile starts to fall in love with Raphael's brother Juan ([[Francisco Reyes Morandé|Francisco Reyes]]) who unlike his brother has a great affection for the gypsies. However, he happens to be a priest. And his nephew and Raphael's son, Sebastián ([[Ricardo Fernández (actor)|Ricardo Fernández]]) becomes enamored with Maria Salomé ([[Francisca Imboden]]), Jovanka’s daughter, who may or may not be his sister.

'''Sekele''' (''Vasekele'', the Angolan Bantu name), or '''Northern ǃXuun''' (Northern Ju); also known by the outdated term '''ǃʼOǃKung''' (''ǃʼO ǃuŋ'', {{IPA-xx|ǃˀoːǃʰũ|}}) "Forest ǃKung" and in one source as '''Maligo''' (Sekele Maligo), is the northern variety of the [[!Kung language|!Kung]] (''ǃXuun'') [[dialect continuum]]. It was widespread in southern [[Angola]] before the civil war,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gordon Jr.|Grimes|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; but now is principally spoken among a diaspora in northern [[Namibia]]. 

A variety currently being investigated is '''Mangetti Dune !Kung''', spoken by a resettled diaspora community of 500–1000 in Namibia and South Africa in the settlements of Mangetti Dune and Omtaku (Omatako?), east of [[Grootfontein]], [[Namibia]], halfway to the [[Botswana]] border; and in Schmidtsdrif, west of [[Kimberley, South Africa]].

==Phonology==
Mangetti Dune !Kung has [[Click consonant|clicks]] with four places of articulation, {{IPA|/ǃ ǀ ǁ ǂ/}}. (A reported distinction between dental lateral and postalveolar lateral clicks has not been confirmed by further research.)

These come in the same eight series as in [[Grootfontein !Kung]], here represented with the palatal articulation:
:Lingual {{IPA|/ǂ ǂʰ ᶢǂ ᵑǂ ᵑ̊ǂʰ/}}
:[[Glottalized click|glottalized]] {{IPA|/ᵑ̊ǂˀ/}}
:[[linguo-pulmonic]] {{IPA|/ǂχ/}}
:[[linguo-glottalic]] {{IPA|/ǂ͡kxʼ/}}

==Sample Text==

Following are some sample texts in the Sekele language.&lt;ref&gt;''Perception and Cognition in Language and Culture''. Alexandra Aikhenvald, Anne Storch
, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

:''mí má kȍhà hŋ́ gǀȕì ō ǁȁhìn-ā ō hȁ ō gǀè gù ǀxūúnnu''

:I must see the hyena to tell it to come catch the crocodile lying there

:''mtícē kwá bà ǀōā kē gǀè-ā g!!ȍhò''

:why didn't you come to work?

:''hȁ má kò kē ǁȁn̏ kú cŋ̏ djūí kā hȁ ǁàȅ-ā tí kē TB ǁ'à-ān tí''

:he was not supposed to drink beer anymore because he had tuberculosis [lit. he was held by TB sickness]

:''hȁ má kò ǁáúlè !xō

:he is supposed to hunt elephants but he didn't

:''mí má kā ǁàȅ n!ùm̀ kā ŋ̄ŋ̀ kā-è cālā n!!á'm̀ g!!à è-tcā

:I hold this rock so that it cannot fall down and kill us.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3276">The '''Shanghai pension scandal''' was a [[Political corruption|corruption]] case in [[Shanghai]], [[China]].

Ultimately, former Shanghai party chief [[Chen Liangyu]] was implicated in the scandal and removed from office. Other high-ranking officials were also implicated such as [[Zhu Junyi]], [[Qin Yu]], [[Yu Zhifei]], and [[Chen Chaoxian]]. Vice-Premier [[Huang Ju]] and his wife [[Yu Huiwen]] were also believed to be involved, but were never officially exposed as being part of the scandal.

==Allegations==

Shanghai's social security fund manages 10 billion [[Renminbi|yuan]] in assets. The allegations were that about a third of public funds was diverted into real estate and road investment projects.&lt;ref name=N24/&gt;

==Dismissals==

[[Chen Liangyu]], the [[Politics of Shanghai|Shanghai Party Chief]] and [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] member was sacked from the party in 2006, becoming the most senior party member to be dismissed in a decade.&lt;ref name=F1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6675625.stm China's F1 track chief dismissed], ''[[BBC]]'', 2007-05-21&lt;/ref&gt; He was accused of illicitly investing billions of yuan of pension fund money in real estate, aiding illegal businesses, shielding corrupt colleagues, and abusing his position to benefit family members.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; On April 11, 2008, Chen, 61, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for accepting $340,000 in bribes and abusing power, specifically, for stock manipulation, financial fraud and his role in the city pension fund scandal, at the No. 2 Intermediate People’s Court, [[Tianjin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/12/world/asia/12shanghai.html?em&amp;ex=1208145600&amp;en=372ecf974b73d985&amp;ei=5087%0A  nytimes.com, Former Party Boss in China Gets 18 Years]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also sacked and expelled from the Communist Party were:

* Yu Zhifei, the manager of [[Shanghai International Circuit|Shanghai's Formula 1 racing track]].
* Chen Chaoxian, a city district chief &lt;ref name=N24&gt;[http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_2116485,00.html Four officials on graft charges], ''News 24'', 2007-05-21&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ling Baoheng, the director of the Shanghai Asset Supervision Board
* Yin Guoyuan, deputy director of the Shanghai housing, land and resources administration

All those sacked will face criminal charges.&lt;ref name=N24/&gt;

==Political context==

Chen was seen as a senior member of the [[Shanghai clique]] who worked with former CPC General secretary, President [[Jiang Zemin]] and were seen as rivals to the former CPC General secretary, President [[Hu Jintao]].  The dismissals were seen as strengthening the authority of Hu within the party and weakening the Jiang loyalists.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=2486562 Top Shanghai Leader Removed From Office], ''[[ABC News]]'', 2006-09-25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==

A thinly veiled reference to this scandal is a major plot element of the Chinese TV drama ''[[Dwelling Narrowness]]''.

'''Steven Paul Raphael''' (born November 13, 1968) is an American economist and Professor of Public Policy in the [[Goldman School of Public Policy]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], as well as an adjunct fellow at the [[Public Policy Institute of California]]. He is also a research fellow at the [[University of Michigan]] National Poverty Center, the [[University of Chicago Crime Lab]], and the [[Institute for the Study of Labor]] in [[Bonn, Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://gspp.berkeley.edu/directories/faculty/steven-raphael | title=Steven Raphael | work=University of California, Berkeley | accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Raphael's research focuses on economic aspects of low-wage labor markets, housing, and [[incarceration in the United States]], as well as, more recently, the social consequences of [[mass incarceration]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=ppic/&gt; He has also studied the effectiveness of incarceration in decreasing crime in the modern United States, and has contended that "We have a fairly strong body of research that suggests as the incarceration rate goes up, the effectiveness of incarceration as a crime-control tool goes down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2015/07/16/423257919/is-it-possible-to-let-more-people-out-of-prison-and-keep-crime-down | title=Is It Possible To Let More People Out Of Prison, And Keep Crime Down? | work=NPR | date=16 July 2015 | accessdate=21 May 2016 | author=Kaste, Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he and [[Michael Stoll]] reported that incarceration was less effective at reducing crime when the prison population was high than when it was low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/business/economy/in-the-us-punishment-comes-before-the-crimes.html?_r=0 | title=In the U.S., Punishment Comes Before the Crimes | work=New York Times | date=30 April 2014 | accessdate=21 May 2016 | author=Porter, Eduardo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also co-authored studies with Stoll and Magnus Lofstrom finding that when California reduced its incarceration rate significantly, this reduction seemed to have no effect on [[violent crime]] rates in the state, and that it had a modest effect on [[property crime]], especially auto theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lofstrom|first1=M.|last2=Raphael|first2=S.|title=Incarceration and Crime: Evidence from California's Public Safety Realignment Reform|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=18 February 2016|volume=664|issue=1|pages=196–220|doi=10.1177/0002716215599732}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://psmag.com/california-s-criminal-justice-experiment-15b07de95fed#.bqtsy88xp | title=California’s Criminal Justice Experiment | work=Pacific Standard | date=24 February 2016 | accessdate=21 May 2016 | author=Wheeling, Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research has also suggested that wages for low-skilled white American workers in [[Arizona]] declined during 2008 and 2009, but that the median incomes of employed workers in this group rose by 6% during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-thorny-economics-of-illegal-immigration-1454984443 | title=The Thorny Economics of Illegal Immigration | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=9 February 2016 | accessdate=21 May 2016 | author=Davis, Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tabu Homosexualität: Die Geschichte eines Vorurteils''''' ({{lang-de|The Taboo of Homosexuality: The History of a Prejudice}}) is a standard work of Germanophone research into [[homophobia]], written by German sociologist, ethnologist, and sexologist [[Gisela Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg]], and first published in 1978.

== Background ==

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg used the better part of the 1970s in order to complete ''Tabu Homosexualität: Die Geschichte eines Vorurteils'' (reprinted in 1981, then leaving out the word ''Tabu'' from its title) as beside drawing from scholars such as [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Marija Gimbutas]], and [[Michel Foucault]], she conducted sociological research on homophobia and homosexuality, and translated previously unavailable or neglected artifacts and records from dead languages for the first time.

== Authority ==

''Tabu Homosexualität'' is considered a foundational standard work in Germanophone research into homophobia, misogyny, patriarchy, general repression of sensuality and particularly repression of sexual deviance (''Leibfeindlichkeit'').&lt;ref&gt;Jantzen, Wolfgang (1980).

== Content ==

=== Introducing chapters ===

In the prefacing ''Einführung'', Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg deals with the post-WWII mitigation of German laws forbidding same-sex activities, and her motivations for researching the issue of homophobia, an undertaking whereupon she came upon increasingly earlier and earlier manifestations each inspiring countless cultural derivations of this hatred.

In order to give an idea of the old age of negative prejudices directed against same-sex activities in the West, in Chapter I, ''Alte Nachrichten über die ethische Bewertung der männlichen Homosexualität bei germanischen Stämmen'' ("Ancient sources on the ethical evaluation of male homosexuality by Germanic tribes"), Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg mainly discusses many ancient European writers (mostly Greek and Roman) denouncingly accusing other tribes and nations across Europe as tolerant towards same-sex activities as was a common form of slander in Classical Antiquity, the absurdity of which is emphasized by the fact that writers of accused groups often accused the accuser's nation of the same thing even if ignorant of the original accusation hauled towards themselves. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg thereby also demonstrates the strong [[numinous]] taboo regarding same-sex activities making them a near-unmentionable vice, as no rational explanation for this ostracization is ever provided, these activities are invariably depicted as negative ''in themselves''.

Only three exceptions are mentioned where the purpose of slander is not immediately obvious: Greek philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] in the third volume of his ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' mentioned a tribe of ''Karmans'' among whom "lewdness between men ''[...]'', as is said, is not regarded as abominable but just like any ordinary thing". Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg identifies it as one of many examples of Sextus Empiricus's often-used rhethoric device of applying the most absurd properties to people, places, and other objects simply for the purpose of demonstrating basic rules of logic. The second exception is a note by [[Posidonius]], quoted in [[Diodorus Siculus]]'s ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'', on [[Celts|Celtic]] sleeping customs which Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg attributes to a misunderstanding of traditional separation of the sexes in daily life.

The third is an analysis of the common modern scholarly debate around the ritual killing of criminals regarded as altogether ''ignavi et imbellis et corpore infames'' ("cowardly, unbelligerent, and perverted") by proto-historic [[Germanic peoples|Germanics]] as mentioned by [[Tacitus]] in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', whereupon Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg first remarks that the complex issue of common Western homophobia as apparent in the presented material must be analyzed at a wider, more interdisciplinarian scope.

=== Ethnic and cultural background: The Three Strata of Indo-European society ===

According to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's socio-psychological, socio-historical interdisciplinary approach to the topic of homophobia, drawing from research fields such as cultural anthropology, religious studies, ethnology, philology, and linguistics, the ethnocentric prejudice towards particularly male same-sex attraction and activities in the history of Western, Indo-European cultures is intrinsically identical to misogyny, thus originally gave rise to, and until the modern age maintained, patriarchal structures of Indo-European society.

Its roots and cultural elements can be traced back several millennia into Eurasian culture, and were originally based on the subsequent overlapping and conflict-ridden superimposition of the three basic ethnic and cultural [[stratum|strata]] (see [[stratification (archeology)]], [[social stratification]], and [[archaeological horizon]]) underlying all modern Indo-European cultures. These three successive strata were the following:

*The Stone Age ''Subarctic Shamanic Culture'' of the [[last glacial period]] (called ''Würm'' regarding the Alps region, ''Weichsel'' regarding Scandinavia, and ''Devensian'' regarding the British Isles) ending c. 9,000 BCE,
*the ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' of European and Middle East [[Bronze Age]], introducing farming and practicing [[fertility rite|fertility cults]] including sexual rites (c. 9.000 BCE to c. 3.000 BCE; roughly equivalent to Gimbutas's ''"[[Old European culture|Old Europe]]"''),
*and the violent West-bound conquest of these regions by belligerent Proto-Indo-European tribes from Asia (see [[Bronze Age collapse]], [[Kurgan hypothesis]], and [[Æsir-Vanir War#Theories]]), beginning around the end of the fourth millennium BCE, introducing domestication of animals (particularly horses for purposes of work, mobility, and especially warfare) and cattle breeding, and initiating the Indo-European [[Iron Age]] in Europe and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Note: Not all subsequent Indo-European or Indo-European-influenced cultures adopted or retained Indo-European languages. For instance, Semitic cultures never adopted an Indo-European language in spite of the obvious belligerent, sensually repressive Indo-European influence found in Abrahamitic and Semitic cultures. See Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's 1990 work ''Vom Schmetterling zur Doppelaxt'' based in this respect mainly on [[:de:Reinhard Schmoeckel|Reinhard Schmoeckel]]'s ''Indogermanistik'' research.&lt;/ref&gt;

See also [[Three-age system]]. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg interprets these three strata as relating to the [[trifunctional hypothesis]] by [[Georges Dumézil]], of classic Indo-European society consisting of three distinct classes, clerical (= Shamanic), agricultural, and warrior. Yet other than Dumézil, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg does not regard all three of these components as genuinely Indo-European or Proto-Indo-European. Instead, in regard of the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] and what Gimbutas saw as "[[Old European culture|Old Europe]]", Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg considers these three components as the result of successive superimposition of what originally were the above-mentioned three different cultures, with Indo-European culture in Europe and the Middle East since the Iron Age as the result. See [[Proto-Indo-European society]] for details.

The immediate cause of Indo-European homophobia, misogyny, and patriarchy was an ethnocentric culture shock when Proto-Indo-European tribes encountered the highly sensual ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' in general, and particularly last traces of Shamanic ritual transvestism and sex change absorbed within this culture. In proto-historic Norse culture for instance, the resulting [[religious stratification]] emerged as the cultural strata of the subdued and marginalized ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' and the subsequently dominant Indo-European influence respectively transformed into maternal, fertility [[Vanir]] and belligerent, patriarchal [[Æsir]] religion, with the mythological [[Æsir-Vanir War]] as a distorted cultural memory of Europe's Indo-Europeanization, similar to the story of [[The Rape of the Sabine Women]] in ancient Italy potentially recalling the same proto-historical process.

=== Subsequent derivations within Indo-European societies ===

From there, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg traces the genesis of homophobia via a number of historical derivations which exhibited increasing levels of rationalization:

*'''Chapter IV, ''Interdependenzen zwischen religiösen Werten und sozialen Normen bei den Germanen'' ("Interdependencies between religious values and social norms in Germanic culture"):''' Within subsequently dominant Indo-European culture, the originally highly regarded Shamanic priest of the subdued and marginalized ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' was ethnocentrically re-interpreted as an evil figure, and the former fertility rites as evil lewd magic. The least rationalized version of the resultant negative archetype of a lewd, non-human freak as apparent in sufficiently surviving artifacts and records is to be found in Norse sources, as the mythological, demonic ''[[Níð|nithing]]'' creature. Due to this lack of rationalization of the archetype's Norse version, it is the most pure, primordial version available to modern research, and the attributes of the ''nithing'' are thus the most easily identifiable among all the archetype's local variations as a negative ethnocentric, mythological re-interpretation of the ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' stratum under the circumstances of Indo-European cultural dominance. As explained in further chapters, this socio-cultural archetype of an evil, lewd non-human freak became a profound influence for every aspect about ubiquitous ''Leibfeindlichkeit'' (repression of sensuality) that followed from it in Western civilization.
*'''Chapter V, ''Tendenzen der Beurteilung homosexuellen Verhaltens von der Christianisierung bis zum Beginn der Ketzer- und Hexenverfolgungen'' ("Tendencies in evaluation of homosexual behaviour between Christianisation and the beginning inquisitorial persecution of witches and heretics"), section 1, ''Die römische Gesetzgebung'' ("Roman laws"):''' Capital homophobic tendencies in Ancient Rome as apparent for instance in ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' (Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg does not cover Ancient Greece in depth until her 1990 book ''Vom Schmetterling zur Doppelaxt'', only emphasizing in ''Tabu Homosexualität'' and later works that [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|ancient Greek pederasty]] does not meet her primary focus for ''Tabu Homosexualität'' of same-sex activities among adult males, as in Ancient Greece, these relations took place between fertile and infertile individuals, by quoting, among other modern scholars and ancient sources, [[Kenneth Dover]]).
*'''Chapter V, section 2, ''Die kirchlichen Bestimmungen'' ("Ecclesiastical regulations"):''' Homophobia apparent in the ancient Jewish culture ([[Leviticus 18]]) and in Early Christianity ([[Saint Paul]], early [[Church Fathers]], and [[penitential]]s) up to the ninth century CE. Here, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg debunks the Biblical origin of the common ''Sodom myth'' created by Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] in the 500s CE who was the first person in the world to claim that [[Genesis 19]] would in any way relate to same-sex activities.
*'''Chapter V, section 3, ''Die gefälschten Kapitulare des Benedictus Levita'' ("The forged capitularies of Benedictus Levita"):''' The Medieval ecclesiastical concept of ''[[sodomy]]'' brought forth by the forged ''[[Benedictus Levita|Capitularia Benedicti Levitae]]'' within ''[[Pseudo-Isidore]]'' (a collection of persuasive false material on theological, legal, and political matters fabricated by [[Franks|Frankish]] monks around 850 CE). During proto-historic Iron Age, the religious fertility rites of the marginalized ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' stratum had been ethnocentrically interpreted as the evil, lewd ''seid'' magic of a ''nithing'' in proto-historic Norse and Germanic sources. Referencing Justinian's ''Sodom myth'', Frankish monk Benedictus Levita as the author of the ''Capitularia Benedicti Levitae'' obviously appealed to these prevailing folk beliefs when he strongly associated his idea of ''sodomy'' with evil sorcery, satanism, heathenism, and heresy. Thereby, he also originally incorporated the common Germanic practice of burning ''nithings'' into ecclesiastical law as burning ''sodomites'' and ''witches'' alike at the stake. Prior to Levita, church dogma had denounced belief in witches and burning people out of these pagan beliefs as sinful.
*'''Chapter VI, ''Die Pönalisierung der Homosexualität im Rahmen der Ketzer- und Hexenprozesse des Mittelalters'' ("The penalisation of homosexuality within the Medieval heresy and witch trials"):''' How Levita's ideas were put into practice by creating the Inquisition. Also discusses in-depth the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' as an extension and further popularization of Levita's original ideas on ''sodomites'' and ''witches''.
*'''Chapter VII, ''Weiterentwicklung und Modifizierung des Vorurteils gegen die Homosexualität bis 1870'' ("Further developments and modifications of homophobic prejudice up until 1870"):''' Arriving at the theories of pathology (Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg specifically mentions the concept of ''[[moral insanity]]''), corruption, and downfall of the state brought fourth by the [[Age of Reason]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the history of these pseudo-scientific ideologies, and how they were instrumental in prolonging the traditional persecution of sexual deviants, especially homosexuals, in the Western world from the 17th to the 20th century.
*'''Chapter VIII, ''Beeinträchtigung der Erforschung des Vorurteils gegenüber der männlichen Homosexualität durch das Vorurteil selbst'' ("Obliteration of research into homophobic prejudice caused by the very prejudice itself"):''' Socio-psychological analyses of patterns and social dynamics of general and specifically homophobic prejudice and discrimination in Western society, building upon the facts, patterns, and concepts demonstrated in earlier chapters, emphasizing again the cultural impact and significance of Indo-European influence and the Three Strata of Western culture in general. In further detail than in this one chapter, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg would re-visit this academic field of general ''Vorurteilsforschung'' (''prejudice studies'') in her later work ''[[Angst und Vorurteil]]'' (1989), in-depth analyzing in full the common patterns of prejudice and discrimination in modern Western society following from the cultural evolution described in ''Tabu Homosexualität''.

=== Relations to other works, by Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg and others ===

In ''Mannbarkeitsriten'' (1980) and ''[[Angst und Vorurteil]]'' (1989), Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg further chronicles the re-enforcing influence of Western [[colonialism]] when Indo-European cultures began globally expanding from the [[Age of Discovery]] and [[First European colonization wave (15th century–19th century)|Age of Conquests]] on, thus explorers and conquerors again came upon Shamanic cultures partly involving ritual fertility and sexual cults, and Europe simultaneously encountered the wide spread of [[syphilis]] through these new cross-cultural contacts just when modern science began to dawn.

These processes also fostered ethnocentric beliefs of Indo-European moral superiority over "uncivilized", sensual, and "filthy" "savages" (see for instance the saying of the ''[[White man's burden]]'' of being morally obliged to "civilize" non-Westerners), social and ethnic "aliens", and marginalized minorities in a complex process of interior socio-psychological, cultural structuring of human sensual desires on the one hand, and foreign political and military colonialism of these desires on the other hand. Thus, in all three books (''Tabu Homosexualität'', ''Mannbarkeitsriten'', and ''Angst und Vorurteil'') Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg alludes to cultural anthropology works such as ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' by [[Hannah Arendt]], Freud's ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'', [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'', Critical Theory's ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' and ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'', or ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' by [[Norbert Elias]].

Finally, as Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg relates in ''Angst und Vorurteil'', just as colonialism and the rise of syphilis had compromised the [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment|scientific Enlightenment]] approach to sexuality, the impact of [[HIV]] corrupted [[Counterculture of the 1960s|post-WWII progressive counterculture]]'s influence on Western society's attitudes towards sexuality.

After winning several major trophies with [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]] in French football, West went on to play for both [[Derby della Madonnina|Milanese]] clubs, [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] and [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. He also appeared in the top level leagues of England and Germany.

Internationally, West made 42 caps for [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] between 1994 and 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://rsssf.com/miscellaneous/twest-intl.html | title=Taribo West - International Appearances | publisher=rsssf.com | accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; being a member of the team in two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s and two [[Africa Cup of Nations|African Championship]]s. He also represented his country at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], winning the gold medal.

==Club career==

===Early years===
Born in [[Port Harcourt]], West was discovered by Monday Sinclair,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.supersport.com/football/football-features/news/110415/QA_with_Monday_Sinclair | title=Q&amp;A with Monday Sinclair | publisher=supersport.com | date=15 April 2011 | accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who recruited him to play for [[Sharks F.C.|Sharks]]. He started playing professionally with Obanta United in 1989, before returning to Sharks in 1990. West then played for [[Enugu Rangers]] in 1991, before joining [[Julius Berger F.C.|Julius Berger]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.supersport.com/football/super-eagles/news/131003/Q_A_with_Taribo_West | title=Q &amp; A with Taribo West | publisher=supersport.com | date=3 October 2013 | accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auxerre===
Following successful trials in early 1993, West joined French side [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]] led by [[Guy Roux]]. He was on the bench during a 2–2 [[1993–94 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] draw against [[CD Tenerife|Tenerife]] on 15 September 1993, but failed to make his debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=1993/matches/round=644/match=50170/postmatch/lineups/index.html | title=Tenerife 2-2 Auxerre | publisher=uefa.com | accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; West eventually played his first competitive game for the club in a 0–0 away league draw at [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]] on 5 March 1994. He became a first team regular in the following season, making 31 appearances in all competitions. In the [[1995–96 French Division 1|1995–96 season]], West helped Auxerre win their first league title in the club's history, alongside such players as [[Laurent Blanc]] and [[Sabri Lamouchi]], among others. They also won the national cup, thus collecting [[Double (association football)|the double]]. West subsequently made seven appearances in the [[1996–97 UEFA Champions League]], as the club was eliminated in the quarter-finals by the eventual champions [[Borussia Dortmund]].

===Internazionale and Milan===
In June 1997, West was transferred to Italian side [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]], on a four-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.liberation.fr/sports/1997/06/26/foot-2-taribo-west-quitte-auxerre-pour-l-inter-milan_208613 | title=FOOT (2). Taribo West quitte Auxerre pour l'Inter Milan | language=French | publisher=liberation.fr | date=26 June 1997 | accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his competitive debut for the club in a 1–0 [[Coppa Italia]] victory over [[Foggia Calcio|Foggia]] on 3 September 1997. Subsequently, West scored his first goal for Internazionale in a 2–1 [[Serie A]] win against [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] on 9 November 1997. He also scored the extra time winning goal against [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] in the [[1997–98 UEFA Cup]] quarter-finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=1997/matches/round=744/match=54581/postmatch/lineups/index.html | title=Schalke 1-1 Internazionale | publisher=uefa.com | accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Internazionale won the competition led by [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] and [[Iván Zamorano]], with West being sent off in the [[1998 UEFA Cup Final|final]] against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=1997/matches/round=746/match=54858/index.html | title=Inter finally complete their hat-trick | publisher=uefa.com | date=1 September 2014 | accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1998–99 Serie A|next season]], West made 21 league appearances, as the club missed securing a spot in [[UEFA competitions]]. He failed to make any appearance in the [[1999–2000 Serie A|1999–2000 season]], being three times an unused substitute.

In the 2000 winter transfer window, West switched to Internazionale's crosstown rivals [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. He made his debut for the club on 24 March 2000, coming on as an injury time substitute for [[Andriy Shevchenko]] in 2–0 win over [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. On 14 May 2000, West managed to score his only goal for Milan in a 4–0 victory over [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]].

===England and Germany===
In November 2000, West moved to English club [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], on an initial three-month loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/d/derby_county/1004450.stm | title=West heads for Derby | publisher=bbc.co.uk | date=2 November 2000 | accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the Rams on 18 November 2000, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–0 home league win over [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]]. In January 2001, West signed an extension to stay with the Derbyshire side until the end of the [[2000–01 FA Premier League|2000–01 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/d/derby_county/1124102.stm | title=West stays with Rams | publisher=bbc.co.uk | date=24 January 2001 | accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped the team avoid relegation, making 18 appearances, as Derby won 31 out of their 42 total points with him in the lineup. In May 2001, West eventually left the club because his "international commitments".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/d/derby_county/1320757.stm | title=Taribo goes West | publisher=bbc.co.uk | date=9 May 2001 | accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/aug/01/newsstory.sport5 | title=Premiership transfers in full | publisher=theguardian.com | date=1 August 2001 | accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Religion and beliefs===
A devout [[Christianity|Christian]], West admittedly used charms before games during his professional career as a footballer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.pulse.ng/sports/taribo-west-ex-footballer-admits-using-charm-to-play-matches-id4184624.html | title=Ex-footballer admits using charm to play matches | publisher=pulse.ng | date=20 September 2015 | accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually became a [[pastor]] after his footballing days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.pulse.ng/communities/religion/taribo-west-ex-footballer-turned-pastor-holds-church-crusade-id3775113.html | title=Ex-footballer turned pastor holds church crusade | publisher=pulse.ng | date=19 May 2015 | accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, West founded a church called "Shelter in the Storm Miracle Ministries of All Nation" in Lagos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/bmqgw5/wtf-happened-to-taribo-west | title=WTF Happened To...

===Age controversy===
In 2010, it was reported that West and other Nigerian internationals, such as [[Jay-Jay Okocha]], [[Nwankwo Kanu]] and [[Obafemi Martins]], were much older than they claimed to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/feb/21/nigerian-football-age-old-problem | title=Forever young: Nigerian football's age-old problem | publisher=theguardian.com | date=20 February 2010 | accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, [[Žarko Zečević]], former general secretary of Partizan, said that West is 12 years older than his claimed age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2303426/Taribo-West-accused-lying-28-40.html | title=Taribo West 'was 40 when he said he was 28', claims former Partizan Belgrade chief | publisher=dailymail.co.uk | date=3 April 2013 | accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, West denied the accusation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/3276/serie-a/2013/04/04/3878347/west-plays-down-age-concern | title=West plays down age concern | publisher=goal.com | date=4 April 2013 | accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telugu literature''' or '''Telugu Sahityam''' ({{lang-te|తెలుగు 
సాహిత్యము}}) is the body of works written in the [[Telugu language]]. It consists of poems, novels, [[short stories]], dramas and [[puranas]]. Telugu literature can be traced back to the early 10th century period (''Prabandha Ratnavali&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ebooks.tirumala.org/Home/Download/?ID=614|title=Prabandha Ratnavali|last=Prabhakara Sastry|first=Veturi|publisher=Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=44|orig-year=1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;''(1918) talk about the existence of [[Telugu literature#The Jain Literature Phase.28850-1000 AD.29|Jain Telugu literature]] during 850-1000AD) followed by 11th century period when [[Mahabharata]] was first translated to Telugu from Sanskrit by [[Nannaya]]. It flourished under the rule of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], where Telugu was one of the empire's official languages.

Telugu split from Proto-Dravidian between 1500-1000 BC. Telugu became a distinct language by the time any literary activity began to appear in the Tamil land, along with Parji, Kolami, Nayaki and Gadaba languages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lists.hcs.harvard.edu/mailman/listinfo/proto-dravidian Telugu Split from Proto-Dravidian]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources ==
There are various sources available for information on early Telugu writers. Among these are the prologues to their poems, which followed the Sanskrit model by customarily giving a brief description of the writer, a history of the king to whom the book is dedicated, and a chronological list of the books he published. In addition, historical information is available from inscriptions that can be correlated with the poems; there are several grammars, treatises, and anthologies that provide illustrative stanzas; and there is also information available from the lives of the poets and the traditions that they followed.&lt;ref name="Chenchiah 1988 19"&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Telugu Literature |last= Chenchiah |first= P. |authorlink= |author2=Rao, Raja Bhujanga  |year= 1988 |publisher= Asian Educational Services |location= |isbn= 81-206-0313-3 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subject matter ===
Early Telugu literature is predominantly religious in subject matter. Poets and scholars drew most of their material from, and spent most of their time translating epics, such as the ''[[Ramayana]]'', the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the ''[[Bhagavata]]'' and the ''Puranas'', all of which are considered to be storehouses of Indian culture.&lt;ref name="Chenchiah 1988 33"&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Telugu Literature |last= Chenchiah |first= P. |authorlink= |author2=Rao, Raja Bhujanga  |year= 1988 |publisher= Asian Educational Services |location= |isbn= 81-206-0313-3 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the sixteenth century onwards, rarely known episodes from the ''Puranas'' would form the basis for the tradition of Telugu-language ''[[kavya]]''. Literary works are drawn from episodes of the ''Puranas'' under the name ''Akhyana'' or ''Khanda'' became popular along with depictions of the fortune of a single hero under the title of Charitra, Vijaya, Vilasa and Abhyudaya. Such titles are examples of what would become the most common subject matter of poetry.&lt;ref name="Chenchiah 1988 33" /&gt;

In the eighteenth-century, marriages of heroes under the title Parinaya, Kalyana and Vivāha became popular.&lt;ref name="Chenchiah 1988 33" /&gt;

Religious literature consisted of biographies of the founders of religion, their teachings (''[[Sara (religion)|Sara]]'') as well as commentaries (''[[bhashya]]'').&lt;ref name="Chenchiah 1988 33" /&gt;

Traditional Hindu knowledge systems such as [[Vedic astrology|astrology]], [[Arthashastra|law]], grammar, ballets, moral [[aphorisms]], and [[Bhakti movement|devotional psalms]] to deities within the Hindu pantheon are characteristics of more popular works of Telugu literature.&lt;ref name="Chenchiah 1988 33" /&gt;

=== Forms ===

Telugu literature uses a unique expression in verse called [[Champu]], which mixes [[prose]] and poetry. Although it is the dominant literary form, there are exceptions: for example, Tikkana composed ''[[Uttara Ramayana]]'' entirely in verse.&lt;ref name="Chenchiah 1988 34"&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Telugu Literature |last= Chenchiah |first= P. |authorlink= |author2=Rao, Raja Bhujanga  |year= 1988 |publisher= Asian Educational Services |location= |isbn= 81-206-0313-3 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Champu Kavyas and Prabandhas were beyond the comprehension of masses, new devices for the dissemination of knowledge among the people were developed in the form of the [[Dvipada]] and [[Shataka]] styles. Dvipada means two feet ([[couplet]]) and Shataka means hundred (a [[cento]] of verses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Telugu Literature |last= Chenchiah |first= P. |authorlink= |author2=Rao, Raja Bhujanga  |year= 1988 |publisher= Asian Educational Services |location= |isbn= 81-206-0313-3 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Popular shatakas: Sarveshvara shataka, Kalahastishvara shataka, Dasarathi Shataka)

There are some Shatakas which are divided into ten groups of ten verses called [[Dasaka]] which is adopted from Prakrit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Telugu Literature |last= Chenchiah |first= P. |authorlink= |author2=Rao, Raja Bhujanga  |year= 1988 |publisher= Asian Educational Services |location= |isbn= 81-206-0313-3 |page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Avadhanam]] is a literary performance popular from the very ancient days in Sanskrit and more so in Telugu and Kannada languages.&lt;ref name="Avadhanam" /&gt; It requires a good memory and tests a person's capability of performing multiple tasks simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Avadhanam" /&gt; All the tasks are memory intensive and demand an in-depth knowledge of literature, and prosody. The number of Prucchakas can be 8 (Ashtavadhanam) or 100 (Shataavadhaanam) or even 1000 (Sahasravadhanam). A person who has successfully performed Ashtavadhanam is called as Ashtavadhani, a Shatavadhanam is called a Shatavadhani and Sahasraavadhaanam is called Sahasravadhani.&lt;ref name="Avadhanam" /&gt;

=== Author's craft ===
'''Praudha Prabandha''' or '''Maha Kavya''' is considered as highest form of verse. The essentials of such a composition according to the Telugu poetic theory are
* '''''Śaili (Style)''''': The words chosen neither soft nor very musical but dignified (Gambhira), Sweetness ([[Madhurya]]), Grace and Delicacy ([[Sukumara]]), Fragrance ([[Saurabhya]]) and Symphony. In choice of vocabulary, Vulgar language ([[Gramya]]) is avoided.&lt;ref name="Chenchiah 1988 34" /&gt;
* '''''Ṕāka (Mould)''''': Refers to the embodiment of ideas in language, and the nature and texture of the language employed. There are three types of pakas namely
:*'''''Drāksha (wine or grape)''''': Draksha is a crystal clear style where everything is seen through a transparent medium. Mostly [[Nannaiyah]] uses this mould.&lt;ref name="Chenchiah 1988 34" /&gt;
:*'''''Kadali (Plantain)''''': Kadali is complex paka because the soft skin has to peeled to reach the core of the subject. Mostly [[Tikkana]] uses this mould.&lt;ref name="Chenchiah 1988 34" /&gt;
:*'''''[[Narikela]] (coconut)''''': Narikela is the most difficult mould to employ because one has to break the [[Peel (fruit)|rind]] to understand the idea. [[Vishnu Chittiyam]] or [[Krishnadevaraya]] are cast in this paka.&lt;ref name="Chenchiah 1988 35"&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Telugu Literature |last= Chenchiah |first= P. |authorlink= |author2=Rao, Raja Bhujanga  |year= 1988 |publisher= Asian Educational Services |location= |isbn= 81-206-0313-3 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]] (Sentiment)''''': Rasa is the heart and soul of any Telugu poetry which follows rule or ([[Sutra]]m) ''"Vākyam Rasātmakam Kāvyam"'' which means that the soul of a sentence is Rasa. There are nine Rasas, known as the [[Nava Rasas]].&lt;ref name="Chenchiah 1988 35" /&gt; A perfect [[kavya]]m uses all nine of these, namely:
:*[[Sringara|śṛṅgāra]] (love)
:*[[Hāsya]] (Comic)
:*[[Karuṇā]] (Sympathy)
:*Raudram (Horror)
:*[[Bhayānaka]] (Fear)
:*[[Bībhatsa]] (Disgust)
:*[[Vīra]] (Heroic)
:*[[Adbhuta]] (wonder)
:*[[Inner peace|Shantam]] (Peace)
* '''''Alamkāra (Ornamentation)''''': There are Śabdhalamkāras (ornaments of sound) and Arthalamkāras (ornaments of thoughts). [[Slesha]] ([[double entendre]]) and [[Yamaka]] ([[alliteration]]) are Śabdhalamkāras. [[Upamāna]] (simile) [[Utpreksha]] (hyperbole) are Arthalamkāras.&lt;ref name="Chenchiah 1988 35" /&gt; We find usage of [[Alamkara]]s in description of events, places and proceedings etc.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== History ==

=== Early writers ===

==== The Pre-Nannayya Period (before 1020 AD) ====
In the earliest period, Telugu literature existed in the form of inscriptions, precisely from 575 AD on-wards.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

The 6th or 7th century [[Sanskrit]] text ''[[Jānāśrayī Chandoviciti]]'' (or ''Janāśraya-chandas'') deals with the [[metre (poetry)|metres]] used in Telugu, including some metres that are not found in [[Sanskrit prosody]]. This indicates that Telugu poetry existed during or around the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=G. Ramakrishna |editor2=N.

==== The Jain Literature Phase(850-1000 AD) ====
Historically, [[Vemulawada, Karimnagar district|Vemulawada]] was a [[Jain]] knowledge hub and played a significant role in patronizing Jain literature and poets.1980s excavations around Vemulawada revealed and affirmed the existence of Telugu Jain literature between 850-1000 AD.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

[[Malliya Rechana]] has composed the first Telugu poetic prosody book [[Kavijanasrayam]]( Pre-Nannayya chandassu)  around 940 AD. This was a popular one and referred by many poets. There seems to be even an earlier prosody book by Rechana's guru Vaadindra Chudamani which is not available.

Veturi Prabhakara Sastry in 1900s mentioned about the existence of ''Pre-Nannayya Chandassu''  in Raja Raja Narendra Pattabhisekha Sanchika.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Accurate dating of this piece of literature happened after the 1980s discoveries in Karimnagar.

''Prabandha Ratnavali&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;''(1918) also talks about a verse from Telugu ''Jinendra Puranam'' by [[Jain]] Padma Kavi([[Adikavi Pampa|Pampa]]), a couple of verses from Telugu ''Adi Puranam'' by Sarvadeva and ''[[Kavijanasrayam]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s affiliation to [[Jainism]] were discussed.P.V.P Sastry also points out that many [[Jain]] works could have been destroyed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Historical rivalry among Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism is well known&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MaLgBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=Jain%20literary%20works&amp;f=false|title=Rethinking Hindu Identity|last=Jha|first=Dwijendra Narayan|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Age of the Puranas (1020-1400AD) ====
This is the period of [[Kavi Trayam]] or Trinity of Poets. [[Nannayya]], [[Tikkana]] and [[Yerrapragada]] (or Errana) are known as the Kavi Trayam.

===== Nannaya Bhattarakudu or Adi Kavi (1022–1063 AD) =====
[[Nannayya|Nannaya Bhattarakudu's]] ({{lang-te|నన్నయ}}) ''[[Andhra mahabharatam]]'', who lived around the 11th century, is commonly referred to as the first Telugu literary composition (''aadi kaavyam'').{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Although there is evidence of Telugu literature before Nannaya, he is given the epithet ''Aadi Kavi'' ("the first poet"). Nannaya was the first to establish a formal grammar of written Telugu. This grammar followed the patterns which existed in grammatical treatises like [[Aṣṭādhyāyī]] and [[Pāṇini|Vālmīkivyākaranam]] but unlike [[Pāṇini]], Nannayya divided his work into five chapters, covering [[samjnā]], [[sandhi]], ajanta, [[halanta]] and [[kriya]].&lt;ref name="Padmapriya ch1"&gt;{{cite book |title= A Comparative Study of Andhrasabdachintamani And Balavyakaranam |last= Gopavaram |first= Padmapriya |authorlink= |url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/1830 |accessdate=December 31, 2013| year= 2011 |publisher= University of Hyderabad |location=Hyderabad|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Tikanna Somayaji (1205–1288 AD) =====
Nannaya's ''Andhra Mahabharatam'' was almost completed by [[Tikkana|Tikanna Somayaji]] ({{lang-te|తిక్కన సోమయాజి}}) (1205–1288) who wrote chapters 4 to 18.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===== Errapragada =====
[[Yerrapragada|Errapragada]], ({{lang-te|ఎర్రాప్రగడ}}) who lived in the 14th century, finished the epic by completing the third chapter.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} He mimics Nannaya's style in the beginning, slowly changes tempo and finishes the chapter in the writing style of Tikkana.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} These three writers – Nannaya, Tikanna and Yerrapragada – are known as the ''Kavitraya'' ("three great poets") of Telugu. Other such translations like [[Marana]]’s ''Markandeya Puranam'', [[Ketana]]’s ''Dasakumara Charita'', [[Yerrapragada]]’s ''Harivamsam'' followed. Many scientific{{Relevance inline|date=May 2010}} works, like ''Ganitasarasangrahamu'' by [[Pavuluri]] Mallana and ''Prakirnaganitamu'' by Eluganti Peddana, were written in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Raju | last = P.

===== Baddena Bhupala (1220-1280AD) =====
''Sumati Shatakam'', which is a ''neeti'' ("moral"), is one of the most famous Telugu [[Shatakam]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Shatakam is composed of more than a 100 ''padyalu'' (poems). According to many literary critics{{who|date=January 2012}} ''Sumati Shatakam'' was composed by [[Baddena Bhupaludu]] ({{lang-te|బద్దెన భూపాల}}) (CE 1220–1280). He was also known as Bhadra Bhupala. He was a [[Chola]] prince and a vassal under the [[Kakatiya]] empress [[Rani Rudrama Devi]], and a pupil of Tikkana.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} If we assume that the ''Sumati Shatakam'' was indeed written by Baddena, it would rank as one of the earliest Shatakams in Telugu along with the ''Vrushadhipa Satakam'' of [[Palkuriki Somanatha]] and the ''Sarveswara Satakam'' of [[Yathavakkula Annamayya]].{{original research inline|date=January 2012}} The ''Sumatee Shatakam'' is also one of the earliest Telugu works to be translated into a European language, as [[C.

The fourth line is, in the majority of the cases, the chorus ''Vishwadhabhirama Vinura Vema'' – he thus conveyed his message with three small lines written in a simple vernacular.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} He traveled widely across south India, acquiring popularity as a poet and Yogi.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} So high was the regard for Vemana that a popular Telugu saying goes 'Vemana's word is the word of the [[Vedas]]'.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} He is celebrated for his style of ''Chaatu padyam'', a poem with a hidden meaning.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}  Many lines of Vemana's poems are now colloquial phrases of the Telugu language.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} They end with the signature line ''Vishwadhaabhi Raama, Vinura Vema'', literally ''Beloved of Vishwadha, listen Vema''.

==== Krishnadevaraya ====
Krishnadevaraya ({{lang-te|శ్రీ కృష్ణదేవరాయ}}) was an emperor of Vijayanagara Kingdom. Literary activities flourished during the rule of the Vijayanagara dynasty,{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} and the period of Krishnadevaraya's rule in the sixteenth century is considered{{By whom|date=January 2012}} to be the golden age of Telugu literature.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Krishnadevaraya, a poet himself, introduced the ''Prabandha'' to Telugu literature.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} ''Amukta Malyada''.

His family had originally hailed from [[Tenali]] in [[Guntur District]], he was born in a Telugu [[Niyogi]] Brahmin family. His famous work ''Panduranga Mahatyamu'' is one among the [[Pancha Kavyas]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} He dedicated that to [[Viruri Vedadri]].&lt;ref name="textbooksonline.tn.nic.in"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/11/Telugu/Poetry/6%20Susarmopakyanamu.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410182256/http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/11/Telugu/Poetry/6%20Susarmopakyanamu.pdf |archivedate=10 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This book is about the Pundarika Kshetram on the banks of river Bhaimi and its legend. He also composed ''Udbhataradhya Charitram'' on the story of Udbhata, a monk, as well as ''Ghatikachala Mahatyam'' about [[Ghatikachala]]m, a place of worship for God [[Narasimha]] near [[Vellore]]. He followed the Prabandha style. He took the theme for ''Panduranga Mahatyam'' from the [[Skanda Purana]] and enhanced it with many stories about the devotees of God [[Vitthala]] (Panduranga). He is noted for brilliance and wit and for mocking other poets and great personalities. He created a celebrated character called ''Nigama Sarma akka'' (sister of Nigama Sarma) and a story about her without giving her a name. He also had written many ''Chatuvu'' (extempore poems).

==== Kshetrayya ====
[[Kshetrayya]] or Kshetragna ({{lang-te|క్షేత్రయ్య}}) ({{circa|1600–1680 CE}}) was a prolific poet and composer of Carnatic music. He lived in the area of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. He composed a number of ''padams'' and ''keertanas'', the prevalent formats of his time. He is credited with more than 4000 compositions, although only a handful have survived. He composed his songs on his favourite deity Krishna (Gopala) in Telugu. He perfected the ''padam'' format that is still being used today. His ''padams'' are sung in dance ([[Bharatanatyam]] and [[Kuchipudi]]) and music recitals. A unique feature of his padams is the practice of singing the ''[[anupallavi]]'' first then the ''[[pallavi]]'' (second verse followed by first verse). Most of the padams are of the theme of longing for the coming of the lord Krishna. He wrote with [[Sringara]] as a main theme in expressing ''madhurabhakti'' (devotion to the supreme). Sringara is a motif where the mundane sexual relationship between a Nayaki (woman) and a Nayaka (man) is used as a metaphor, denoting the yearning of [[Jiva|jeeva]] (usually depicted as the Nayaki) to unite with the divine (usually depicted as the man). In most of his compositions, Kshetrayya has used the ''[[mudra (music)|mudra]]'' (signature) "Muvva Gopala" as a reference to himself, which is also a name for Lord Krishna in Kshetrayya's village Muvva, now called as [[Movva]]. Kshetrayya's work has played a major role in influencing poetry, dance, music of the South Indian tradition. Kshetrayya was intimately connected with the [[devadasi]] women of the temples of south India, who were the subject of many of his compositions. The devadasis were traditionally in possession of the musical/poetic interpretations of his work for a long period of time till the devadasi system was abolished and the compositions became more accepted in the musical community as valuable works of art. The musical community also owes a lot to [[Veena Dhanammal]] and [[T. Brinda]], who popularised Kshetrayya's songs with their beautiful musical interpretation. Kshetrayya's padyams now form an integral part of the dance and musical traditions of South India, where his songs are rendered purely as musical works or as accompaniments to dance.

==== Kancherla Gopanna ====
[[Kancherla Gopanna]] ({{lang-te|కంచెర్ల గోపన్న}}) (c 1620–1680 CE), popularly known as Bhadradri Ramadasu or Bhadrachala Ramadasu ({{lang-te|భద్రాచల రామదాసు}}), was a 17th-century Indian devotee of Rama and a composer of Carnatic music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2005/09/02/stories/2005090202270200.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=''Bhakta Ramadas'' staged | date=2 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one among the famous vaggeyakaras (same person being the writer and composer of a song) in the Telugu language. His devotional lyrics to Rama are famous in South Indian classical music as ''Ramadaasu Keertanalu''. Even the doyen of South Indian classical music Saint Thyagaraja learned and later improved the style now considered standard kriti form of music composition. He also has written Dasarathi Shatakamu a collection of nearly 100 poems dedicated to the son of Dasaratha ([[Rama|Lord Rama]]).

==== Venkamamba ====
[[Tarikonda Venkamamba]] (Telugu:తారికొండ వెంకమాంబ ; alternate spelling: Vengamamba, born 1730) was a poet and staunch devotee of Lord Venkateswara in the 18th century. She wrote numerous poems and songs.

==== Tyagaraja ====
[[Tyagaraja]] or Tyagabrahmam ({{lang-te|కాకర్ల  త్యాగబ్రహ్మం}}) (1767–1847) of [[Tanjore]] composed devotional songs in Telugu, which form a big part of the repertoire of Carnatic music. In addition to nearly 600 compositions (kritis), Tyagaraja composed two musical plays in Telugu, the ''[[List of compositions by Tyagaraja#Prahlada Bhakti Vijayam|Prahalada Bhakti Vijayam]]'' and the ''[[List of compositions by Tyagaraja#Nouka Charitram|Nauka Charitam]]''. ''Prahlada Bhakti Vijayam'' is in five acts with 45 ''[[kriti]]s'' set in 28 [[raga]]s and 138 verses, in different metres in Telugu. ''Nauka Charitam'' is a shorter play in one act with 21 ''kritis'' set in 13 ''ragas'' and 43 verses. The latter is the most popular of Tyagaraja's operas, and is a creation of the composer's own imagination and has no basis in the ''Bhagavata Purana''. Often overlooked is the fact that Tyagaraja's works are some of the best and most beautiful literary expressions in [[Telugu language]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Valmiki composed the [[Ramayana]], the story of Rama, with 24,000 verses and also composed 24,000 kritis in praise of the lord.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==== Paravastu Chinnayasuri ====
[[Paravastu Chinnayasuri]] ({{lang-te|పరవస్తు చిన్నయ సూరి}}) (1807–1861) wrote ''Baala Vyaakaranamu'' in a new style after doing extensive research on ''Andhra Grammar''{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} which is his greatest gift {{Peacock term|date=May 2010}} to Telugu people. Other notable works of Chinnayasuri include ''Neeti Chandrika'', ''Sootandhra Vyaakaranamu'', ''Andhra Dhatumoola'' and ''Neeti Sangrahamu''. Chinnayasuri translated Mitra Labham and Mitra Bhedam from the Sanskrit [[Panchatantra]] as ''Neeti Chandrika''. [[Kandukuri Veeresalingam]] and [[Kokkonda Venkata Ratnam Pantulu]] followed his style of prose writing and wrote ''Vigrahamu'' and ''Sandhi'' in a different pattern.{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}

=== Tripuraneni Ramaswamy ===
Tripuranēni Rāmasvāmi (January 15, 1887 – January 16, 1943) was a lawyer, famous poet, playwright and reformer active among the Telugu-speaking people. Popularly known as Kaviraju, he is considered the first poet to introduce rationalism and humanism into Telugu poetry and literature. Ramaswamy chose literary writing as the vehicle for expressing his rationalist thoughts. His famous work 'Sutaparanam' in four cantos was a fierce attack on the ancient Puranas, he has attained the state of excellence in poetic&amp;literary criticism. His poetic work "Kuppuswamy Satakam" reveals the theme of social revolution and talks about social evils, blind faith, and indignity to man. He was against Congress and its fight against independence.
In his other works such as "Sambhukavadha", "Suthashrama geetaalu', 'Dhoorta maanava', 'Khooni', 'Bhagavadgita', 'Rana Pratap' and 'Kondaveeti patanam', he made a rational analysis of dogmas prescribed by ancient classics and the injustice these dogmas did to people belonging to the lower social orders. Moreover, he attacked discriminatory practices and fought against the idea of untouchability. Sambhuka Vadha created a lot of controversies. Sambhuka was a character who did tapas to go heaven with the live body before death. That was considered as adharma and was killed by Lord Rama. This story was interpreted that Brahmins do not like doing tapas by non-Brahmins, which is why Sabhuka was killed.

The {{nihongo|'''Thirty-Six Immortals of Poetry'''|三十六歌仙|Sanjūrokkasen}} are a group of Japanese poets of the [[Asuka period|Asuka]], [[Nara period|Nara]], and [[Heian period]]s selected by [[Fujiwara no Kintō]] as exemplars of [[waka (poetry)|Japanese poetic ability]]. The eldest surviving collection of the 36 poets' works is ''[[Nishi Honganji Sanjū-rokunin Kashu]]'' ("Nishi Honganji 36 poets collection") of 1113. Similar groups of Japanese poets include the [[Kamakura period]] ''Nyōbō Sanjūrokkasen'' (女房三十六歌仙), composed by court ladies exclusively, and the {{nihongo|''Chūko Sanjūrokkasen''|中古三十六歌仙}}, or Thirty-Six Heian-era Immortals of Poetry, selected by [[Fujiwara no Norikane]] 藤原範兼 (1107–1165). This list superseded an older group called the [[Six Immortals of Poetry]].

Sets of portraits (essentially imaginary) of the group were popular in [[Japanese painting]] and later [[woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]], and often hung in temples.

The '''Tibetan Aid Project''' (TAP) is an operation of the Tibetan Nyingma Relief Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Your Friends the Tibetan Refugees: A Chronicle of the Tibetan Aid Project 1969-2000|year=2001|publisher=Dharma Publishing|location=Berkeley, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; TAP was founded in 1969 by Tarthang Tulku—a leading Tibetan master and teacher—to support the courageous efforts of Tibetans to survive in exile and re-establish their rich cultural heritage. It is a 501 c (3) non-profit organization that primarily focuses on raising funds for the production, shipment and distribution of sacred texts, art and prayer wheels for the World Peace Ceremony in [[Bodh Gaya]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Better Business Bureau|title=Charity Review|url=http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/arts-and-culture/tibetan-aid-project-in-berkeley-ca-2895|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Chinese invasion of 1959, more than 1 million Tibetans were killed and 6,237 monasteries were destroyed along with their libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holloway|first=Nigel|title=Publish or Perish|journal=Far Eastern Economic Review|date=8 February 1996|pages=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, TAP has filled hundreds of libraries with Tibetan books, stimulated education in the Himalayan region, fostered literacy across Tibetan society, improved the economy of Bodh Gaya, India, and enabled nuns—who were traditionally limited to non-scholastic activities—to study texts and earn advanced degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us: Tibetan Aid Project|url=http://tibetanaidproject.org|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monastic Importance in Tibet ==

The monastic tradition was and still is uniquely strong for Tibetans. In 1951, monasteries had access to and occupied between 37 and 50 percent of the best, most fertile land in Tibet. In addition, the government strongly supported the monasteries, providing money for prayer ceremonies and other religious activities. In the three largest monasteries around Lhasa, there alone were twenty thousand monks. Before the Chinese takeover, between 10 and 20 percent of males in Tibet were monks. This is a much higher percentage compared to other Buddhist countries. In Thailand, for example, only 1-2 percent of its males were monks in the mid-1900s. According to Melvyn C. Goldstein, the large number of monasteries was a result from the Tibetans' belief that "Tibet's greatness lay in its development of a system wherein tens of thousands of young boys were constantly being taken away from the mundane world of inevitable suffering and thrust into a purer alternative culture—the organized community of celibate monks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Melvyn C.|title=A History of Modern Tibet: Volume 2 The Calm before the Storm, 1951-1955|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When China invaded Tibet in 1959, thousands of these monasteries were destroyed along with their libraries, marking the beginning of a precarious time for Tibetans and their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holloway|first=Nigel|title=Publish or Perish|journal=Far Eastern Economic Review|date=8 February 1996|pages=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Founder ==

In 1959 with around 100,000 of his followers, the Dalai Lama fled from Chinese persecution. Prior to that Tarthang (Tar-tung) Tulku, a Tibetan lama, had traveled to study in  Sikkim with his primary teacher, Khentse Rinpoche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holloway|first=Nigel|title=Publish or Perish|journal=Far Eastern Economic Review|date=8 February 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later settling in India on a scholastic fellowship, Tarthang Rinpoche spent six years teaching Buddhist philosophy at Sanskrit University in Benares. He also began a small Tibetan-language publishing company. After years of witnessing the decline of his culture and the living conditions of his fellow refugees, Tarthang traveled to California in 1968. In Berkeley—where there was already a flourishing array of East-meets-West, his desire to help the Tibetans and all humanity would have a place to grow. Later, he would establish Dharma Publishing and the Tibetan Aid Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lattin|first=Don|title=Buddhist master in the 'land of the Red Man'|newspaper=San Francisco Examiner|date=19 June 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Books ==

In the 7th century, Buddhism came to Tibet from India. The religion thrived in the region and a steady flow of the Buddha's teachings were translated from Sanskrit to Tibetan. These texts were canonized as the Kanjur and the Tanjur. The Kanjur is the sacred teachings of the Buddha and the Tanjur, a large collection of commentary on the teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Massive Tibetan Buddhist Canon Published|newspaper=The Japan Times|date=26 June 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the desire to publish these Tibetan texts, Tarthang searched everywhere for the Kanjur and the Tanjur. However, there were very few copies to be found. Empty-handed, Tarthang spread the word to the Tibetan refugees, some of whom had carried books instead of food with them during the mass exodus of 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holloway|first=Nigel|title=Publish or Perish|journal=Far Eastern Economic Review|date=8 February 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Tibetan refugees responded to Tarthang's search, and as a result, in 1982 Dharma Publishing was able to put together a complete canonical collection of the texts based on the Derge Edition and other editions, including nine texts from the Chinese Canon. Containing 5,109 texts and totaling 65,160 pages, the Canon also includes traditional Tibetan art and is the most complete collection of the Kanjur and Tanjur ever assembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Massive Tibetan Buddhist Canon Published|newspaper=The Japan Times|date=26 June 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the Kanjur and the Tanjur, Tarthang oversees the production of other sacred Tibetan texts written by numerous great teachers and philosophers, such as Dudjom Rinpoche, Jigme Lingpa and Patrul Rinpoche, to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tibetan Aid Project: Annual Report 2010-2011|year=2011|publisher=Tibetan Aid Project|location=Berkeley, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Peace Ceremony ==

In 1989, Tarthang organized an annual ceremony in order to pray for world peace at Bodh Gaya in Bihar, India—the site of Buddha's enlightenment. The Ceremony takes place in January and lasts for 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holloway|first=Nigel|title=Publish or Perish|journal=Far Eastern Economic Review|date=8 February 1996|pages=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the World Peace Ceremony, the Tibetan Aid Project distributes thousands of books to Tibetans. Over the span of 22 years, TAP has helped give away more than three million books and sacred art prints and over 140,000 prayer wheels, preserving the Tibetan teachings of wisdom and compassion for generations to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tibetan Aid Project: Annual Report 2010-2011|year=2011|publisher=Tibetan Aid Project|location=Berkeley, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taste &amp; Tribute San Francisco: A Benefit Dinner Gala ==

In 2001, Chef Laurent Manrique proposed to the Tibetan Aid Project of doing a charity dinner to which he would invite some of his other chef friends to join in. Over the years, it has grown into the main fundraiser for the Tibetan Aid Project. During the event, over 20 of the Bay Area's best chefs work in pairs to prepare exquisite meals for 220 guests at the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chef Laurent Manrique raises funds to preserve Tibetan culture |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/chef-laurent-manrique-raises-funds-to-preserve-tibetan-culture/Content?oid=2184762 |publisher=The SF Examiner |author=Paul Gackle |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sister Sites and Organizations ==

In addition to the Tibetan Aid Project, Tarthang established several other organizations to not only preserve Tibetan culture but to also benefit all humanity.

The Nyingma Institute was founded in 1972. It offers lectures, classes and retreats on Buddhist studies, meditation, yoga, Nyingma psychology and other classes. Since its beginning, over 150,000 students have attended the Nyingma Institute in Berkeley, California.

The Dharma Publishing Company was moved to the United States from India. It began its operations in 1971 with the goal to preserve Tibetan culture by keeping important books in print. Every year, Dharma Publishing publishes and distributes thousands of Tibetan texts around the world. It also publishes books by Tarthang Tulku., such as Time, Space and Knowledge, Gesture of Balance and Skillful Means.

The Mangalam Research Center for Buddhist Languages, founded in 2008, is the center where scholars come to study Buddhism, its written tradition and its sacred texts. In its library, it holds one of the world's greatest collections of Tibetan texts.

Dharma College is new and will eventually offer noontime and evening lectures for the community in addition to college and graduate-level classes for students of Tibetan Buddhism.

The Yeshe De Text Program or the Tibetan Book Project preserves Tibetan texts for distribution.

The Guna Foundation began in 2009 in order to preserve archival pictures and footage of Tarthang Tulku and his organizations. The foundation currently finished the documentary Light of the Valley, which is about the 15th renovation of the Swayambhu Stupa in Kathmandu, Nepal. The foundation also funds Yak Liberation, a group that releases yaks back into the wild.

The Light of Buddhadharma Foundation raises funds to preserve and restore shrines and cultural artifacts in India, pay for religious ceremonies at holy places in India and buy robes for monks.

Odiyan Retreat Center, located on 1,000 acres of land in a remote part of Northwestern Sonoma County, this retreat center was founded in 1975. At Odiyan, scholars and practitioners can immerse themselves in meditation and Nyingma training.

The Ratna Ling Retreat Center began in 2004 near Cazadero, California. Dharma Press was relocated to Ratna Ling shortly after the acquisition. As the new home to Dharma Presses, Ratna Ling is a retreat, education and spiritual center geared towards operating the presses by uncompensated retreatants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dinkelspiel|first=Frances|title=Tibetan Buddhism flourishes in downtown Berkeley|url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/2010/11/29/tibetan-buddhism-flourishes-in-berkeley/|publisher=Berkeleyside|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Tuxedo Club''' is a private member-owned [[country club]] located on West Lake Road in the village of [[Tuxedo Park, New York]], in the [[Ramapo Mountains]].  Founded in 1886 by [[Pierre Lorillard IV]], its facilities now include an 18-hole [[golf]] course, [[tennis|lawn tennis]], [[real tennis|court tennis]], [[racquets (sport)|racquets]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[platform tennis]], olympic-sized pool, and boating.  The [[black tie|tuxedo]] was introduced by New York millionaire James Potter at the club's first Autumn ball in 1886, after a trip to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Tuxedo Club History |url=http://www.thetuxedoclub.org/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&amp;pageid=307535&amp;ssid=195366&amp;vnf=1|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original clubhouse, designed by [[Bruce Price]], was built in 1886 and demolished in 1927.  [[John Russell Pope]]'s clubhouse was constructed on the original stone foundations the following year.  The clubhouse is U-shaped, with stucco over wood frame, low hipped slate roof, stone embedded in stucco, leaded glass casements, and mullions forming crosettes in continuous fenestration.  Located at the foot of [[Tuxedo Lake]], it commands a view to the other end of lake and two ranges of wooded hills.  A lawn extends between the club house and the lake.

To the northwest of the clubhouse is the court tennis and racquet house, also on West Lake Road. Designed by architects [[Warren and Wetmore]], it was built between 1890 and 1900.  Made of Bickley cement and supported by stone and brick arches in the basement, these courts became a model for future courts built in the [[United States]].  They have full galleries for spectators.  The original glass roof with canvasses has been replaced with artificial light.

==Golf course==
The golf course does not sit near the main clubhouse facility.  It is roughly {{convert|5|mi|km|sigfig=1}} away just outside the gates of the private community known as Tuxedo Park where the main club, tennis club and pool are located.  The golf course is actually the third golf course of the club, as the first became the Blair estate and the second was overtaken by the [[New York State Thruway]], forcing the move of the course to the new location near the Eagle Valley section of Tuxedo.  The course existing today was designed by [[Robert Trent Jones|Robert Trent Jones, Sr.]]  It is an 18-hole championship course.

==Migration history==
Both being former [[French colonial empire|French colonies]], Vietnam and [[Senegal]] have a long history of cultural links. Beginning in the 1930s, many Senegalese began serving in Vietnam as [[Military of France|soldiers for France]]; some took local wives, with whom they had children. However, in the turbulent 1940s, with [[World War II]] and the [[First Indochina War]], many Vietnamese women married to Senegalese followed their husbands back to Senegal. By 2007, Jean Gomis, himself a Vietnamese descendant and an unofficial "community leader", estimated that fewer than five of those wives remained alive, while 300 of their descendants lived scattered throughout Senegal. They retained some knowledge of the [[Vietnamese language]] and still cook [[Vietnamese cuisine]]; however, Gomis expected that within 10 years, the [[language attrition|language would no longer be spoken]].&lt;ref name="VOA"/&gt;

In the 1990s, Vietnamese agricultural technicians began to arrive in Senegal under the sponsorship of the [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], through an initiative to promote cooperation between the nations of the [[global South]]. By 2001, their numbers had risen from 40 to 100.&lt;ref name="LeMonde"/&gt; Most technicians come to Senegal on two year stints, unaccompanied by their spouses, and live in group housing with other Vietnamese. They aim to promote small-scale technologies and techniques suitable to Senegal's level of economic development; for example, Vietnamese [[beekeepers]] introduced Senegalese farmers to manually driven centrifugal [[honey extractor]]s and Vietnamese-style concrete [[beehive]]s.&lt;ref name="SouthSouth"/&gt; Others attempted to familiarise Senegalese people to the representative Vietnamese fish sauce ''[[nước mắm]]''. Though as of 2001, it was only produced and used by the restaurants in Dakar, Vietnamese technicians in the seaside town of [[M'Bour]] trained a women's group in its preparation, and produced roughly 20 tanks of the sauce.&lt;ref name="FishSauce"/&gt; Most of the technicians speak only Vietnamese, though they typically learn some [[Wolof language]] agricultural vocabulary during their time in the country.&lt;ref name="SouthSouth"/&gt;
