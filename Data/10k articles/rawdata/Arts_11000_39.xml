The '''Artificio de Juanelo''' was the name of two devices built in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in the 16th century by [[Juanelo Turriano]]. They were designed to supply the city with a source of readily available water by lifting it from the [[Tagus]] (''Tajo'') river to the [[Alcázar of Toledo|Alcázar]]. Now in ruins, the precise details of the operation of the devices are unknown, but at the time they were considered engineering wonders.

==History==
[[File:Toledo alcazar bridge large flickr.jpg|thumb|left|A modern view of the Tagus by Toledo. The Alcázar is on top.]]
Juanelo Turriano, an Italian-Spanish clock maker, [[engineer]] and [[mathematician]], was called to [[Spain]] in 1529 and appointed Court Clock Master by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. By 1534 he was working in Toledo, then the capital of the Spanish Empire. Both the [[Roman aqueduct]] that had originally supplied the city with water and a giant [[water wheel]] constructed by the [[Moors]] during the time of the [[Caliph of Córdoba|Caliphate of Córdoba]] had been destroyed and various attempts to supply the demands of the growing city with water by employing the technologies of the time had failed. When Turriano arrived in Toledo, [[donkey|asses]] were being used to transport [[Pitcher (container)|pitcher]]s of water from the river to the city. This involved a climb of about 100&amp;nbsp;metres (330&amp;nbsp;ft) over uneven ground and was highly inefficient.

Sometime after his arrival in Toledo, Turriano was challenged by [[Alfonso de Avalos]], [[Marqués de Vasto]], to provide a method of transporting water from the Tagus to supply the city. Turriano produced detailed plans for the device but various stoppages and obstacles hindered the construction, among which was the death of Charles V in 1558. Although his successor, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] was not as interested in engineering as his father had been and the prestige that Turriano had enjoyed under Charles diminished under his son, Philip nevertheless recognized the value of Turriano, named him ''Matemático Mayor'' and employed him on various engineering projects. Although it appears that at times the construction of the water lifting device may have been abandoned, by 1565 Turriano had managed to re-exert his control over the project and contracted with the city council to provide water to the amount of 1,600 pitchers daily (which amounted to around 12,400&amp;nbsp;litres (3,275&amp;nbsp;US&amp;nbsp;gallons)) to the city on a permanent basis within three years.

The exact start date of operation is unknown, but by 1568 the machine was delivering around 14,100&amp;nbsp;litres (3,725&amp;nbsp;US&amp;nbsp;gallons) a day, well over the agreed levels. However, the city refused to pay Turriano the agreed price, arguing that since the water was stored at the Alcázar it was for the exclusive use of the royal palace, rather than the town. Frustrated by the council's refusal to pay, and in debt from the costs of the device's construction, Turriano entered into another agreement, underwritten by the Crown, to build a second device for the supply of the city. However, it was agreed that this time he and his heirs would retain the rights for the operation. This second version was completed in 1581, and although the Crown paid the costs of construction, Turriano was unable to cover the costs of maintenance and was forced to give up control of the machine to the city. He died shortly afterwards in 1585.

The machines continued to operate until around 1639 when thefts of parts and lack of maintenance led to both machines falling into disrepair. The first machine was disassembled and the second left standing as a symbol of the city, but operation ceased and water once again had to be transported in pitchers on the backs of asses. Further theft of parts reduced the second machine to ruins, and nowadays little of it remains.

==Operation==

The device caused a great sensation as the height to which the water was raised was more than double what had been previously achieved. Various waterwheel constructions had previously managed modest lifts, but before the construction of the Artificio, the highest lift had been just under 40&amp;nbsp;metres (130&amp;nbsp;ft) at [[Augsburg]] using an [[Archimedes' screw|Archimedean screw]].

The details of the construction are the subject of debate, but the most widely accepted design is that proposed by Ladislao Reti, based on fragments of contemporary descriptions. A large water wheel powered a revolving belt with buckets or [[amphora]] that transported water to the top of a tower. When the buckets reached the top of the tower they would upend pouring the water into a small tank from where it would travel down to a smaller tower via a pipe. A second water wheel provided [[Mechanical energy|mechanical power]] to pumps that drove a series of cups mounted on arms inside the second tower. The arms of the cups were hollow with an opening at the end which allowed water to run down inside the arm and out of the opposite end. A see-sawing motion of the arms lifted the water to successive levels in the cups. Once the final level was reached the water flowed down a second pipe to a third tower which contained further cups on arms and was also activated by the mechanical power derived from the second water wheel. This final tower raised the water high enough to allow it to flow into the storage tanks at the Alcázar.

'''''Autómata''''' is a 2014 Spanish-Bulgarian [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film]] starring [[Antonio Banderas]]. The film is directed by Spanish director [[Gabe Ibáñez]] and co-written by Ibáñez with Igor Legarreta and Javier Sánchez Donate. Along with Banderas, the film stars [[Birgitte Hjort Sørensen]], [[Melanie Griffith]], [[Dylan McDermott]], [[Robert Forster]] and [[Tim McInnerny]].

== Plot ==
&lt;!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], the plot should be between 400 and 700 words to keep it readable. --&gt;
In the late 2030s, solar flares irradiate the Earth, killing over 99% of the world's population. The survivors gather in a network of safe cities and build primitive humanoid robots, called Pilgrims, to help rebuild and operate in the harsh environment. These robots have two unalterable protocols: they cannot harm any form of life, and they may not repair, modify or alter themselves or other robots in any way. Initially seen as mankind's salvation, they are relegated to [[manual labor]] when they fail to stop the advance of [[desertification]]. Society has regressed due to lack of technology besides the Pilgrims (lack of functional aircraft or other transport prevents travel and cars are a rare commodity) and humanity is on the brink of extinction.

In 2044, Jacq Vaucan – an insurance investigator for ROC, the company that manufactures Pilgrims – investigates a report from Wallace, a police officer who shot a robot he claims was modifying itself. Jacq discovers the robot hid a rare nuclear battery that could power a robot indefinitely. The next day, Jacq follows a robot who was stealing parts. When he corners it, it sets itself on fire. Jacq salvages the remains and speculates to his boss, Robert, that there may be a "clocksmith", someone who illegally modifies robots, who is overriding the second protocol. Incredulous, Robert rejects this possibility but offers Jacq a transfer out of the city if he can find evidence. Jacq's pregnant wife initially rejects his plans but she eventually relents.

Jacq and Wallace investigate a [[brothel]], where they find Cleo, a modified robot that Wallace subsequently shoots in the leg. When Jacq objects, Wallace says that Cleo's owner will lead them to the clocksmith; Wallace also threatens to kill Jacq if he does not split the proceeds of the battery on the black market. Jacq follows Cleo's owner to a clocksmith named Dr. Dupré, who claims not to know who altered Cleo, an action that would destroy Cleo's [[CPU]]. Jacq leaves the burned robot's CPU with her and offers to give her the battery if she can locate information on the clocksmith. When Dupré installs the modified CPU in Cleo, Cleo begins self-repairing. Dupré contacts Jacq, who alerts Robert; however, ROC intercepts Jacq's message and sends a team of assassins to Dupré's lab.

Dupré is killed, but Jacq escapes in a car driven by Cleo. When Cleo takes them into a maze of [[stanchion]]s, both cars crash; the assassins are killed, and Jacq is severely injured. Cleo takes Jacq with her into a radioactive desert, where they are joined by three other robots, none of whom will obey Jacq's orders. However, the first protocol forces them to prevent his death. Desperate to return to the city to be with his pregnant wife, Jacq makes contact with Robert, who sends Wallace to recover him. Wallace threatens Jacq's life and destroys two of the robots, who have objected to his actions; Jacq kills Wallace with a flare gun before he can also destroy Cleo. Wallace's partner flees after taking a battery from one of the robots.

Robert's boss reveals that the first built Pilgrim, unburdened by the second principle, designed the subsequent models. As no human could understand the programming, it was thought to be impossible to subvert. ROC forces Robert to accompany a team sent to kill Jacq and the unknown clocksmith before the robots can evolve further beyond human understanding. When Robert objects to their kidnapping Jacq's wife and baby daughter, Conway, the leader, shoots him and leaves him for dead. Meanwhile, Jacq meets the robot responsible for modifying the others. Initially skeptical, Jacq eventually accepts that the robot naturally evolved, like humanity. After a series of philosophical discussions, Jacq gives them his battery, which they use to complete a new design. The robots repair a vehicle for Jacq, and he leaves for the city.

When Conway reaches the robot outpost, he destroys two of the four robots. Jacq finds the dying Robert and returns to the outpost as Conway wounds Cleo. Jacq kills all ROC assassins but Conway, though he is further wounded in the battle. As Conway prepares to kill Jacq, the new robot saves his life by pushing Conway off a cliff. Jacq overcomes his distrust of the uninhibited robot when reunited with his family, and he leaves for the coast with them, as Cleo and the new robot venture further into the irradiated desert, where no humans can follow them.

'''Baren''' (馬連、馬楝) ''{{Audio|Baren.ogg|listen}}'' is a disk-like hand tool with a flat bottom and a knotted handle used in [[Japanese woodblock printing]]. It is used to burnish (firmly rub) the back of a sheet of paper, lifting ink from the block.
  
==Construction==
[[File:Coiled_cord_for_a_baren.gif|thumb|upright=0.8|A coiled braided cord forms the core of the baren]]
[[File:Baren2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Finishing the wrapping by pressing the baren down firmly with the left hand to tighten the wrapping and twisting the sheath with the right hand to form a handle.]]
The baren is made of layers.  A flat coil of [[braid]]ed cord forms the core. This is placed on a disk (''ategawa'') consisting of 30–40 sheets of high-grade long-fibred hosokawa paper, wrapped in tissue and black [[lacquer]]. This is covered by a thin bamboo sheath (''takenokawa'') twisted in such a manner as to form the handle on the top.&lt;ref name="McGregorIshida2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr. Mark McGregor|author2=Mariko Ishida|title=Ukiyo-e: Secrets of the floating world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPbIDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT50|date=23 April 2016|publisher=Vyiha Publishing|isbn=978-988-13004-3-0|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hiroshi Yoshida]]'s manual ''Japanese Woodblock Printing'' (1939) the ''[[Phyllostachys bambusoides|madake]]'' species of bamboo, grown in Kyushu, southwest Japan, is considered the best one to use.&lt;ref name=hiroshi&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Hiroshi Yoshida|author=Hiroshi Yoshida|title=Japanese Wood-block Printing|year=1939|publisher= Sanseido Company, Tokyo and Osaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bamboo-sheath covering the baren may need to be renewed after a day's printing.  Rewrapping requires great skill; a printer's ability is sometimes judged by their competence carrying out this work.&lt;ref name=hiroshi /&gt;

The disk inside the baren takes 40–50 days to create, as the craftsman glues one sheet of paper on the disk each day.  The disk must then dry for a year before the baren is assembled.  The coil and covering of the baren are woven and formed from parts of the bamboo plant, requiring the skill of a true master. Only one known person in Japan is still making traditional (''hon'') baren for a living — Hidehiko Goto of the Kikuhide workshop.

==Alternatives==
Large wooden spoons are also used as burnishing tools in printmaking, glass jars with a smooth circular base can also be used for some applications. Some new world barens are similar in shape to the traditional one with small metal ball bearings embedded in the bottom surface that generate the high point contact pressures (supplied by the braided cord) and have the low friction (offered by the bamboo leaf covering) of a traditional brayer.  Another interesting baren is one developed by Professor Seishi Ozakus and made from a bundle of bamboo toothpicks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.usask.ca/~nis715/S%20Ozakus.htm Professor Seishi Ozakus' Toothpick Baren]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nik Semenoff has developed a palm press that serves as a baren replacement, made with a number of roller bearings alternating on two close spaced shafts in a small hand held mounting.  The bearings have negligible friction and the pressures achievable are suitable for some [[Offset printing|offset]] [[lithography]] printing, though wider spacing of fewer contact points may make it less suited for traditional wood cut printing.

The '''Behistun Inscription''' (also '''Bisotun''', '''Bistun''' or '''Bisutun'''; {{lang-fa|بیستون}}, [[Old Persian]]: '''Bagastana''', meaning "the place of god") is a multilingual inscription and large [[rock relief]] on a cliff at [[Mount Behistun]] in the [[Kermanshah Province]] of [[Iran]], near the city of [[Kermanshah]] in western [[Iran]]. It was crucial to the decipherment of [[cuneiform script]].

Authored by [[Darius the Great]] sometime between his coronation as king of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in the summer of 522 BC and his death in autumn of 486 BC, the inscription begins with a brief autobiography of Darius, including his ancestry and lineage. Later in the inscription, Darius provides a lengthy sequence of events following the deaths of [[Cyrus the Great]] and [[Cambyses II]] in which he fought nineteen battles in a period of one year (ending in December 521 BC) to put down multiple rebellions throughout the Persian Empire.  The inscription states in detail that the rebellions, which had resulted from the deaths of Cyrus the Great and his son Cambyses II, were orchestrated by several impostors and their co-conspirators in various cities throughout the empire, each of whom falsely proclaimed kinghood during the upheaval following Cyrus's death.

Darius the Great proclaimed himself victorious in all battles during the period of upheaval, attributing his success to the "grace of [[Ahura Mazda]]". The inscription includes three versions of the same text, written in three different [[cuneiform script]] languages: [[Old Persian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], and [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]] (a variety of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]). The inscription is to [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] what the [[Rosetta Stone]] is to [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s: the document most crucial in the [[decipherment]] of a previously lost [[writing system|script]].

The inscription is approximately 15&amp;nbsp;metres high by 25&amp;nbsp;metres wide and 100&amp;nbsp;metres up a [[limestone]] cliff from an ancient road connecting the capitals of [[Babylonia]] and [[Medes|Media]] ([[Babylon]] and [[Ecbatana]], respectively). The Old Persian text contains 414 lines in five columns; the Elamite text includes 593 lines in eight columns, and the Babylonian text is in 112 lines. The inscription was illustrated by a life-sized bas-relief of [[Darius the Great|Darius I, the Great]], holding a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] as a sign of kingship, with his left foot on the chest of a figure lying on his back before him.  The supine figure is reputed to be the pretender [[Gaumata]].  Darius is attended to the left by two servants, and nine one-meter figures stand to the right, with hands tied and rope around their necks, representing conquered peoples. A  [[Faravahar]] floats above, giving its blessing to the king. One figure appears to have been added after the others were completed, as was Darius's beard, which is a separate block of stone attached with [[iron]] pins and [[lead]].

==History==
[[File:BehistunRoute.jpg|225px|thumb|right|The route up to the inscription]]

After the fall of the Persian Empire's [[Achaemenid Dynasty]] and its successors, and the lapse of Old Persian cuneiform writing into disuse, the nature of the inscription was forgotten, and fanciful explanations became the norm. For centuries, instead of being attributed to Darius I, the Great, it was believed to be from the reign of [[Khosrau II]] of [[Persia]]—one of the last [[Sassanid]] kings, who lived over 1000 years after the time of Darius I.

The inscription is mentioned by [[Ctesias|Ctesias of Cnidus]], who noted its existence some time around 400 BC and mentioned a well and a garden beneath the inscription. He incorrectly concluded that the inscription had been dedicated "by Queen [[Semiramis of Babylon]] to [[Zeus]]". [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] also mentions it and includes a description of some of the long-lost ancillary monuments at the base of the cliff, including an altar to "[[Herakles]]". What has been recovered of them, including a statue dedicated in 148 BC, is consistent with Tacitus's description. [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] also writes of "Bagistanon" and claims it was inscribed by Semiramis.

A legend began around [[Mount Behistun]] (Bisotun), as written about by the [[Persian literature|Persian poet and writer]] [[Ferdowsi]] in his ''[[Shahnameh]]'' (''Book of Kings'') {{c.|lk=no|1000}}, about a man named [[Farhad]], who was a lover of King Khosrow's wife, [[Shirin]]. The legend states that, exiled for his transgression, Farhad was given the task of cutting away the mountain to find water; if he succeeded, he would be given permission to marry Shirin. After many years and the removal of half the mountain, he did find water, but was informed by Khosrow that Shirin had died. He went mad, threw his axe down the hill, kissed the ground and died. It is told in the book of [[Khosrow and Shirin]] that his axe was made out of a pomegranate tree, and, where he threw the axe, a pomegranate tree grew with fruit that would cure the ill. Shirin was not dead, according to the story, and mourned upon hearing the news.

In 1598, the [[England|Englishman]] [[Robert Sherley]] saw the inscription during a diplomatic mission to [[Iran|Persia]] on behalf of [[Austria]], and brought it to the attention of Western European scholars. His party incorrectly came to the conclusion that it was Christian in origin.&lt;ref&gt;E. Denison Ross, The Broadway Travellers: Sir Anthony Sherley and his Persian Adventure, Routledge, 2004, {{ISBN|0-415-34486-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; French General Gardanne thought it showed "Christ and his [[twelve apostles]]", and [[Robert Ker Porter|Sir Robert Ker Porter]] thought it represented the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]] and [[Shalmaneser I|Shalmaneser of Assyria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/travelsingeorgia02port/travelsingeorgia02port.pdf] Robert Ker Porter, Travels in Georgia, Persia, Armenia, ancient Babylonia, &amp;c. &amp;c. : during the years 1817, 1818, 1819, and 1820, volume 2, Longman, 1821&lt;/ref&gt; Italian explorer [[Pietro della Valle]] visited the inscription in the course of a pilgrimage in around 1621.

[[File:Aramaic translation of the behistun inscripton.png|thumb|330px|[[Papyrus]] with an [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] translation of the Behistun inscription's text.]]

German surveyor [[Carsten Niebuhr]] visited in around 1764 for [[Frederick V of Denmark]], publishing a copy of the inscription in the account of his journeys in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Niebuhr, Reisebeschreibung von Arabien und anderen umliegenden Ländern, 2 volumes, 1774 and 1778&lt;/ref&gt; Niebuhr's transcriptions were used by [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]] and others in their efforts to decipher the [[Old Persian cuneiform]] script. Grotefend had deciphered ten of the 37 symbols of Old Persian by 1802, after realizing that unlike the Semitic cuneiform scripts, Old Persian text is alphabetic and each word is separated by a vertical slanted symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientscripts.com/oldpersian.html |title=Old Persian |publisher=Ancient Scripts |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100418053701/http://www.ancientscripts.com/oldpersian.html| archivedate= 18 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Persian text was copied and deciphered before recovery and copying of the Elamite and Babylonian inscriptions had even been attempted, which proved to be a good deciphering strategy, since Old Persian script was easier to study due to its alphabetic nature and because the language it represents had naturally evolved via [[Middle Persian]] to the living modern [[Persian language]] dialects, and was also related to the [[Avestan]] language, used in the [[Zoroastrian]] book the ''[[Avesta]]''.

In 1835, [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Rawlinson]], an officer of the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] army assigned to the forces of the [[Shah]] of Iran, began studying the inscription in earnest. As the town of Bisotun's name was anglicized as "Behistun" at this time, the monument became known as the "Behistun Inscription". Despite its relative inaccessibility, Rawlinson was able to scale the cliff with the help of a local boy and copy the Old Persian inscription. The Elamite was across a chasm, and the Babylonian four meters above; both were beyond easy reach and were left for later.

With the Persian text, and with about a third of the [[syllabary]] made available to him by the work of [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]], Rawlinson set to work on deciphering the text. The first section of this text contained a list of the same Persian kings found in [[Herodotus]] but in their original Persian forms as opposed to Herodotus's Greek [[transliteration]]s; for example Darius is given as the original ''Dâryavuš'' instead of the Hellenized ''Δαρειος''. By matching the names and the characters, Rawlinson deciphered the type of cuneiform used for Old Persian by 1838 and presented his results to the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] in [[London]] and the [[Société Asiatique]] in [[Paris]].

In the interim, Rawlinson spent a brief tour of duty in [[Afghanistan]], returning to the site in 1843. He first crossed a chasm between the Persian and Elamite scripts by bridging the gap with planks, subsequently copying the Elamite inscription. He found an enterprising local boy to climb up a crack in the cliff and suspend ropes across the Babylonian writing, so that [[papier-mâché]] casts of the inscriptions could be taken. Rawlinson, along with several other scholars, most notably [[Edward Hincks]], [[Julius Oppert]], [[William Henry Fox Talbot]], and [[Edwin Norris]], either working separately or in collaboration, eventually deciphered these inscriptions, leading eventually to the ability to read them completely.

The translation of the Old Persian sections of the Behistun Inscription paved the way to the subsequent ability to decipher the Elamite and Babylonian parts of the text, which greatly promoted the development of modern [[Assyriology]].

==Later research and activity==
[[File:BehistunInscriptiondetail.jpg|225px|thumb|right|Close-up of the inscription showing damage]]

The site was visited by the American linguist [[A. V. Williams Jackson]] in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;A. V. Williams Jackson, "The Great Behistun Rock and Some Results of a Re-Examination of the Old Persian Inscriptions on It", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', vol. 24, pp. 77–95, 1903&lt;/ref&gt; Later expeditions, in 1904 sponsored by the [[British Museum]] and led by [[Leonard William King]] and [[Reginald Campbell Thompson]] and in 1948 by George G. Cameron of the [[University of Michigan]], obtained photographs, casts and more accurate transcriptions of the texts, including passages that were not copied by Rawlinson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/sculpturesinscri00brituoft/sculpturesinscri00brituoft.pdf] W. King and R. C. Thompson, The sculptures and inscription of Darius the Great on the Rock of Behistûn in Persia: a new collation of the Persian, Susian and Babylonian texts, Longmans, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George G. Cameron, The Old Persian Text of the Bisitun Inscription, Journal of Cuneiform Studies, vol. 5, no. 2, pp. 47–54, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George G. Cameron, The Elamite Version of the Bisitun Inscriptions, Journal of Cuneiform Studies, vol. 14, no. 2, pp. 59–68, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. C. Benedict and Elizabeth von Voigtlander, Darius' Bisitun Inscription, Babylonian Version, Lines 1–29, Journal of Cuneiform Studies, vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 1–10, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;
It also became apparent that rainwater had dissolved some areas of the limestone in which the text was inscribed, while leaving new deposits of limestone over other areas, covering the text.

In 1938, the inscription became of interest to the [[Nazi German]] [[think tank]] [[Ahnenerbe]], although research plans were cancelled due to the onset of World War II.

The monument later suffered some damage from [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] soldiers using it for target practice in [[World War II]], and during the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ancientstandard.com/2011/03/30/the-behistun-inscription-the-iranian-rosetta-stone/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://atlantisonline.smfforfree2.com/index.php?topic=2799.5;wap2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Iranian archeologists began the documentation and assessment of damages to the site incurred during the 20th century. Malieh Mehdiabadi, who was [[project manager]] for the effort, described a [[Photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] process by which two-dimensional photos were taken of the inscriptions using two cameras and later transmuted into 3-D images.&lt;ref name="chnpress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=2589 |title=Documentation of Behistun Inscription Nearly Complete |publisher=Chnpress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918093441/http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=2589 |archivedate=2011-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Iranian archaeologists have been undertaking conservation works.  The site became a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/06/jul/1130.html |title=Iran's Bisotoon Historical Site Registered in World Heritage List |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2006-07-13 |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Bisotun Cultural Heritage Center organized an international effort to re-examine the inscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/arts-and-culture/98233-intl-experts-to-reread-bisotun-inscriptions |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529044243/http://www.tehrantimes.com/arts-and-culture/98233-intl-experts-to-reread-bisotun-inscriptions |archivedate=2012-05-29 |df= }} Intl. experts to reread Bisotun inscriptions, Tehran Times, May 27, 2012{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:F07 0054.Ma.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Bison carved on reindeer [[antler]] fragment, National Museum of Prehistory in [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil]]]]
'''''Bison Licking Insect Bite''''' is a [[prehistoric art|prehistoric carving]] from the [[Upper Paleolithic]], found at [[Abri de la Madeleine]] near [[Tursac]] in [[Dordogne]], France, the [[type-site]] of the [[Magdalenian]] culture, which produced many fine small carvings in antler or bone.

Created sometime between 20,000 and 12,000 [[Before present|BP]] (15,000 BP according to the museum), it was formerly in the [[National Archaeological Museum (France)|Musee des Antiquites Nationales]], [[St. Germain-en-Laye]], but has been transferred to the expanded National Museum of Prehistory in [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil]] that opened in 2004, not far from its findspot. It is a carved and engraved fragment of a [[spear-thrower]] made of [[reindeer]] antler. It depicts the figure of a [[bison]], of the now extinct species [[steppe wisent]] (''bison priscus'') with its head turned around and showing its tongue extended. It is thought the spear-thrower was broken into roughly its present shape before the carving was made from the fragment, hence the need to show the turned-back head of the animal in order to fit the existing structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musee-prehistoire-eyzies.fr/en/collection/tid-4/cid-5/collection-bison-se-lechant, "Collections", National Museum of Prehistory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045958/http://musee-prehistoire-eyzies.fr/en/collection/tid-4/cid-5/collection-bison-se-lechant%2C |date=2015-04-30 }} in Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cleavage''' is the exposed area between a woman’s [[breasts]] lying over the [[Human sternum|sternum]], and refers ''only'' to what is visible with clothing (or dense, nontransparent [[body art]]) that includes a low-cut [[neckline]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, Erin ; Nichols, Elizabeth Gackstetter. [https://books.google.com/books?id=VAUmDwAAQBAJ Beauty around the World: A Cultural Encyclopedia]. Santa Barbara, CA: [[ABC-CLIO]], 2017, p. 81, {{ISBN|978-1-61069-944-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, display of cleavage is considered aesthetic or erotic, and may be associated with garments with low necklines that expose or highlight cleavage, such as [[ball gown]]s, [[evening gown]]s, lingerie, and [[swimwear]]. In these cultures women have, throughout history, sought to enhance their [[physical attractiveness]] and femininity, within the context of changing fashions and cultural-specific [[Norm (social)|norms]] of [[modesty]] of the time and place. The methods practised in appropriate contexts have included the accentuation and partial display of breasts, including cleavage. In some cultures any display of cleavage may be culturally [[taboo]] (e.g. ''juyub'' in Islam,) illegal or otherwise socially disapproved.

}}

The [[Anatomical terminology|anatomical term]] for the area that constitutes a cleavage is [[intermammary cleft]], intermammary sulcus or sulcus intermammarius.

[[Décolletage]] is the upper part of a woman's torso, between her waist and neck, comprising her neck, shoulders, back and chest, that is exposed by the neckline of her clothing. However, the term is most commonly applied to a neckline that reveals or emphasizes cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Barnhart|editor1-first=Robert K.|title=Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-270084-1|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the side of the breasts are uncovered, it is known as "side cleavage", "sidewinders" or "sideboob".&lt;ref name="Dun"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunlap|first1=Elizabeth|title=The glossary: can't pronounce the ingredient, the makeup artist's name, or even the product?

Gabriele Hackworthy, fashion director at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', said, "The look is unlikely to fade fast, with [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]] and [[Roberto Cavalli]] both pushing the silhouette next season."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Imogen|first1=Fox|title=The side cleavage: a new trend is born|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2012/may/29/side-cleavage-new-trend-born|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff writer|title=Trend Watch: The Side Cleavage|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-style/news/trend-watch-the-side-cleavage-2011276|website=Us Weekly|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the lower part of the breasts is uncovered, it is called "underboob".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/16/thailand-warns-underboob-trend-breaks-computer-laws|title=Thailand warns women who post 'underboob' photos face five years in jail|last=Reuters|date=2015-03-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-style/news/kylie-jenner-works-underboob-in-skintight-jumpsuit-photos-w208727|title=Kylie Jenner's Underboob Is Out of Control in This Jumpsuit|work=Us Weekly|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==

=== Western culture ===
{{See also|Dress code|Breast fetishism}}

Many people in [[Western culture]], both male and female, consider breasts an important female [[secondary sex characteristic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/secondary_characteristics.html |title=Secondary Characteristics |work=hu-berlin.de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927075821/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/secondary_characteristics.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an important aspect of femininity. [[Décolletage]] that exposes cleavage is used by many women to enhance their [[physical attractiveness|physical]] and [[sexual attractiveness]] and to improve their sense of femininity. Display of cleavage with a low neckline is often regarded as a form of feminine [[flirting]] or [[seduction]], as much as for its aesthetic or erotic effect. Most men derive [[erotic pleasure]] from seeing a woman's cleavage,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey, Alfred C.]] et al. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]''.  Saunders, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; and some people derive pleasure in their female partner exposing cleavage. When cleavage is enhanced with a push-up bra or exposed by a low neckline it can draw attention.&lt;ref name="scoop"&gt;Dr. Ted Eisenberg and Joyce K. Eisenberg, '' The Scoop on Breasts: A Plastic Surgeon Busts the Myths'', Incompra Press, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-9857249-3-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; During adolescence, some girls become fixated on breast shape and cleavage.&lt;ref name="Ashlea"&gt;Ashlea Worrel, ''An Examination of Women's Body Image and Sexual Satisfaction'', page 15, ProQuest, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-549-65144-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of tight clothing and the display of cleavage have been attributed as causes of an increase in [[breast fetishism]], and atypical [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref name="ggf2003"&gt;{{harvnb|Glazier|Flowerday|2003|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as to how much cleavage exposure is acceptable in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Salmansohn |first=Karen |title=The Power of Cleavage |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-salmansohn/the_power_of_cleavage_b_70260.html  |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=October 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary Western society, the extent to which a woman may expose her breasts depends on social and cultural context. Displaying cleavage or any part of female breast may be considered inappropriate or even prohibited by [[dress code]]s in some settings, such as workplaces, churches, and schools, while in some spaces showing as much cleavage as possible can be permissible or even encouraged. The exposure of [[nipple]]s or [[areolae]] is almost always considered immodest and in some instances is viewed as [[lewd]] or [[indecent exposure|indecent]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;D. Leder, ''The Body in Medical Thought and Practice'', page 223, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-7923-1657-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[James Laver]] argued that the changing standards of revealing cleavage is more prominent in evening wear than in day wear in the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Michael ''Fashion classics from Carlyle to Barthes'', page 732, Berg Publishers, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85973-606-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modesty considerations ===
{{See also|Modesty}}

There is historical evidence that some cultures strongly discouraged cleavage or any hint of a bosom.&lt;ref name="harari"&gt;Herbert Harari and Robert Malcolm Kaplan, ''Social Psychology: Basic and Applied'', page 271, Brooks/Cole Publishing Company, 1982, {{ISBN|978-0-8185-0481-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of the Puritans under James I|Early English Puritans]] used a tight bodice to flatten breasts completely, while 17th century [[Spaniard]]s put lead plates across the chests of young girls to prevent their bosoms from developing.&lt;ref name="harari" /&gt;

In the [[Quran]], the holy book of [[Islam]], it is stated, "Let them draw their [[Khimar]] (shawl/head veil) over their ''juyub'' (breast-line/cleavage)".&lt;ref&gt;[[An-Nur]]:&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/024-qmt.php Ayat 31] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818132125/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/024-qmt.php |date=2016-08-18 }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ayat'' refers to the women's clothes worn, parted in the front to expose the breasts, at the time when it was cited.&lt;ref&gt;L.S. Cahill and M.A. Farley, ''Embodiment, Morality, and Medicine'', page 47, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 1995, {{ISBN|978-0-7923-3342-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haideh"&gt;Haideh Moghissi, ''Women and Islam: Social conditions, obstacles and prospects'', page 77, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-415-32420-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reina Lewis and Sara Mills, ''Feminist Postcolonial Theory: A Reader'', page 589, Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-415-94274-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ziauddin Sardar, ''Reading the Qur'an: The Contemporary Relevance of the Sacred Text of Islam'', page 332, Oxford University Press, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-19-991149-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later interpreted as total covering of a woman's body.&lt;ref name="Haideh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reina Lewis and Sara Mills, ''Feminist Postcolonial Theory: A Reader'', page 590, Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-415-94274-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ziauddin Sardar, ''Reading the Qur'an: The Contemporary Relevance of the Sacred Text of Islam'', page 333, Oxford University Press, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-19-991149-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 21st century [[Muslim world]] there are differences in legal implementation.

=== Theories ===
{{See also|Evolutionary psychology}}

The cleavage area between the breasts is perhaps the epicentre and stimulation of interest{{Clarify|reason=interest in what?|date=November 2018}}. Breast and [[buttock cleavage]]s, sharing a similarity between their appearances, are considered sexual in some cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Asa Berger, ''Media and Society: A Critical Perspective'', page 194, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4422-1780-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; British [[zoologist]] and [[ethologist]] [[Desmond Morris]] theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the cleft between the buttocks.&lt;ref&gt;Morris (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; Swelling of the anterior is a sign of mating-readiness in ape species. Among humans the female genitalia is regressed and the upright posture reduces visibility of the buttocks, but the breasts are significantly enlarged. Theorists{{Who|date=November 2018}} hypothesize that with these evolutionary changes, the measure of mating-readiness and attractiveness in females has shifted from swagging buttocks to the pendulous shape of breasts and cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Curtis, ''Steal This Book Too!'', page 287, Authorhouse, May 2004, {{ISBN|978-1-4184-1875-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] theorize that humans' permanently enlarged breasts, in contrast to other primates' breasts, which only enlarge during [[ovulation]], allowed females to "solicit male attention and investment even when they are not really fertile",&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Charles B. and Krebs, Dennis (eds.) "How Mate Choice Shaped Human Nature", ''Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology: Ideas, Issues, and Applications'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; though Morris notes that in recent years there has been a trend toward reversing breast augmentations.&lt;ref&gt;Morris (1997) pp. 236,240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris (2004), pp. 156-159&lt;/ref&gt; According to social historian David Kunzle, waist confinement and décolletage are the primary [[sexualization]] devices of Western costume.&lt;ref&gt;Craik, Jennifer. ''The Face of Fashion'', page 122, Routledge, 1993, {{ISBN|0-203-40942-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the 21st century, some of the attention given to cleavage and breasts started to shift to buttocks, especially in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Boye De Mente, ''The Origins of Human Violence'', page 61, Cultural-Insight Books, 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-4528-5846-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antiquity ===
In 2600 BCE, princess [[Nofret]] of the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt]] was depicted in a V-neck gown with a plunging neckline that exposed ample cleavage. In 1600 BCE, [[Snake Goddess]] figurines were sculpted in [[Minos]] with open dress-fronts, revealing entire breasts.&lt;ref name=olson&gt;James S. Olson, ''Bathsheba's Breast: Women, Cancer, and History'', page 324, JHU Press, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-8064-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek goddess [[Hera]] wore an early version of a push-up bra, described in the ''[[Iliad]]'' as festooned with "brooches of gold" and "a hundred tassels", to increase her cleavage to divert [[Zeus]] from the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref name=divide&gt;Daphne Merkin, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/style/tmagazine/TW1792179.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0 The Great Divide]", ''New York Times'', August 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Décolletage was often a feature of the dress of the late Middle Ages. This continued through the [[Victorian period]]. Gowns that exposed a woman's neck and top of her chest were very common and uncontroversial in Europe from at least the 11th century until the Victorian period in the 19th century. Ball or evening gowns especially featured low square décolletage designed to display and emphasize cleavage.&lt;ref name="Gernsheimpp"&gt;Gernsheim, Alison. ''Victorian and Edwardian Fashion. A Photographic Survey''. pp. 25-26, 43, 53, 63, Dover Publications, Mineola, N.Y., 1981 (Reprint of 1963 edition). {{ISBN|0-486-24205-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DesmondMorris"&gt;Desmond Morris. ''The Naked Woman. A Study of the Female Body'', p. 156. New York: Thomas Dunne Books, 2004. {{ISBN|0-312-33853-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 14th century, necklines were lowered, clothes were tightened and breasts were once again flaunted. In 1450, [[Agnès Sorel]], mistress to [[Charles VII of France]], is credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with [[toplessness|fully bared breasts]] in the French court.&lt;ref name="histoire_mode"&gt;Monique Canellas-Zimmer, ''Histoires de mode'', Les Dossiers d'Aquitaine – 2005, {{ISBN|9782846221191}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other aristocratic women of the time who were painted with breasts exposed included [[Simonetta Vespucci]], whose [[Portrait of Simonetta Vespucci (Piero di Cosimo)|portrait with exposed breasts]] was painted by [[Piero di Cosimo]] in c.1480.

=== Early modern period ===
[[File:Anne Hyde by Sir Peter Lely.JPG|thumb|left|[[Anne Hyde]], first wife of [[James II of England]] by Sir [[Peter Lely]], about 1665]]

In many European societies between the Renaissance and the 19th century, wearing low-cut dresses that exposed breasts was more acceptable than today; with a woman's bared legs, ankles, or shoulders being considered to be more risqué than exposed breasts.&lt;ref&gt;Cunnington, C.

During the 16th century, women's fashions with exposed breasts were common in society, from queens to common prostitutes, and emulated by all classes. [[Anne of Brittany]] has also been painted wearing a dress with a square neckline. Low square décolleté styles were popular in England in the 17th century and even [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] and [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], wife of [[Charles I of England]], were depicted with fully bared breasts; and architect [[Inigo Jones]] designed a [[masque]] costume for Henrietta Maria that fully revealed both of her breasts.&lt;ref name="Nigel Llewellyn 1660" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsandevents.warwick.ac.uk/index.cfm?page=pressrelease&amp;id=1858 |title=Historian Reveals Janet Jackson's 'Accidental' Exposing of Her Breast was the Height of Fashion in the 1600s|date=5 May 2004|publisher=University of Warwick |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040803155530/http://www.newsandevents.warwick.ac.uk/index.cfm?page=pressrelease&amp;id=1858 |archivedate = 3 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1795–1820 in fashion|fashions of the period 1795–1820]], many women wore dresses that bared necks, bosoms and shoulders. [[Anne of Austria]] was known for wearing, along with female members of her court, very tight [[bodice]] and [[corset]]s that forced breasts together to make deeper cleavages, very low necklines that exposed breasts visible almost in entirety above the [[areola]] and pendants lying on the cleavage to highlight it.&lt;ref name=olson /&gt;

=== Modern period ===
[[Image:Sargent MadameX.jpeg|thumb|This portrait by [[John Singer Sargent]] of [[Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau]] depicting her cleavage caused considerable controversy when it was displayed at the 1884 [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] art exhibition in Paris.]]

During the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] period, social attitudes required women to cover their bosom in public. For ordinary wear, high collars were the norm. Towards the end of the Victorian period (end 19th century) the full collar was the fashion, though some décolleté dresses were worn on formal occasions (see [[1880s in fashion]]).

During the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], there was a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were merely a sensual enticement or rather a natural gift to be offered from mother to child. In [[Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de Moissy]]'s 1771 play ''The True Mother'' (''La Vraie Mère''), the title character rebukes her husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual gratification: "Are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts – the respectable treasures of nature – as merely an embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Schama, Simon]]. ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', p. 147. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1989. {{ISBN|0-394-55948-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly a century later, also in France, a man from the provinces who attended a Court ball at the [[Tuileries]] in [[Paris]] in 1855 was deeply shocked by the décolleté dresses and is said to have exclaimed in disgust: "I haven't seen anything like that since I was weaned!"&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884 ''[[Portrait of Madame X]]'', a portrait painting by [[John Singer Sargent]] of American-born Paris socialite, [[Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau]], was criticized&lt;ref name="Elaine Kilmurray 1998, p. 114"&gt;Richard Ormand and Elaine Kilmurray, ''Sargent: The Early Portraits'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998, p. 114, {{ISBN|0-300-07245-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for depicting her in a sleek black dress displaying what was considered scandalous cleavage and her right shoulder strap fallen off her shoulder. The controversy was so great that he reworked the painting to move the shoulder strap from her upper arm to her shoulder, and Sargent left Paris for London in 1884.&lt;ref name="Fairbrother 2001 139, Note 4"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fairbrother |first=Trevor |title=John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist |year=2001 |isbn= 978-0-300-08744-4 |page=139, Note 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=g&amp;p=a&amp;a=i&amp;ID=424 "Sargent's Portraits"], an article including a mention of the scandal caused by the portrayal of cleavage in [[John Singer Sargent]]'s "[[Portrait of Madame X]]".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, a single pad made of rubber or a "bust form" was advertised that was to be worn inside the front of the bodice to make cleavage virtually undetectable.&lt;ref&gt;Sherrie A. Inness, ''Delinquents and Debutantes: Twentieth-century American Girls' Cultures'', page 117, New York University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-8147-3765-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clergymen all over the world became shocked when dresses to be worn with modest round or V-shaped necklines became fashionable around 1913. In the [[German Empire]], for example, all [[Roman Catholic]] bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking the new fashions.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Fashions became more restrained in terms of décolletage, while exposure of the leg became more accepted in Western societies during [[World War I]] and remained so for nearly half a century.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Kim K. P.; Torntore, Susan J. and Eicher, Joanne Bubolz. ''Fashion foundations'', p. 716, Berg Publishers, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85973-619-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century===
In 1953, Hollywood film ''[[The French Line]]'' was found objectionable under the [[Hays Code]] because of [[Jane Russell]]'s "breast shots in bathtub, cleavage and breast exposure" while some of her décollete gowns were thought "...intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme decolletage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doherty|first=Thomas|title=Hollywood's Censor: Joseph I. Breen and the Production Code Administration|year=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-14358-5|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But other actresses defied the then standards. For example, [[Gina Lollobrigida]] raised eyebrows with her famous low-cut dress in 1960, and other celebrities, performers and models followed suit, and the public was not far behind. Low-cut styles of various depths are now common in many situations. During the 1950s, Hollywood and the fashion industry successfully promoted large cloven bustlines (and [[falsies]]). In the late 1960s, erogenous attention began to shift from the large bust to the trim lower torso, reasserting the need to diet, especially as new clothing fashions — brief, sheer, and close fitting — prohibited heavy reliance on foundation lingerie. Legs were relatively less emphasized as elements of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Mazur, "U.S. trends in feminine beauty and overadaptation", ''Journal of Sex Research'', pp. 281-303, Volume 22, Issue 3, 1986, The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality, Pennsylvania, USA. DOI: 10.1080/00224498609551309&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1960s onward, however, changes in fashions were towards increasing displays of cleavage in films and television, with Jane Russell and [[Elizabeth Taylor]] being the biggest stars who led the fashion,&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Baker, ''Fashions of a Decade'', page 51, Infobase Publishing, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-4381-1891-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in everyday life low-cut dress styles became very common, even for casual wear.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Koestenbaum, ''Cleavage: essays on sex, stars, and aesthetics'', page 125, Ballantine Books, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-345-43460-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wonderbra was created in 1964 by Louise Poirier for Canadelle, a Canadian lingerie company. It had 54 design elements that lift and support the bustline while creating a deep plunge and push-together effect.

The ideal of breasts and cleavage has also evolved in the later half of the 20th century, with shapes enhanced by use of a variety of [[#Cleavage enhancement|methods and techniques]]. In the 1950s the preferred shape was pointy, echoing the [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] look of the times; in the 1960s it was elegantly sloped in alignment with [[Hippie chic]] of the times; and from the 1990s a buffed, pumped and engorged look has become the preference.&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Gill, ''To America with Love'', page 113, Simon and Schuster, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-4165-9621-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century===
[[File:Zoë Bell 07.jpg|thumb|upright|Actress [[Zoë Bell]] in a low-cut dress at a film premiere in USA, 2006]]

21st century women's fashions, especially at formal occasions, has increasingly included low-cut dress designs which expose cleavage. Such dress designs have been most noticeable at various awards presentations, such as those seen at the 2016 [[Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-style/red-carpet/it-was-all-about-cleavage-on-the-oscars-red-carpet-this-year/news-story/3e8b2386e2b8a2474f07963b25f589f5 |title=It was all about cleavage on the Oscars red carpet this year |publisher=News.com.au |date=2016-03-01 |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Zoe |url=http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/news/features/2016/02/cleavage-controversy-at-the-sag-awards |title=Susan Sarandon and Sarah Silverman's cleavage cause controversy at the SAG awards |work=Glamour |location=UK |date=2016-02-06 |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such low-cut dresses still attract comment, though less controversy. It was also noticeable in the 2013 film ''[[American Hustle]]'', as well as in films which expose cleavage in a low-cut bra or swimsuit.

Display of cleavage can still be controversial. In the United States, in two separate incidents in 2007, [[Southwest Airlines]] crews asked travelers to modify their clothing, to wear sweaters or to leave the airplane because the crew did not consider the amount of cleavage displayed acceptable.&lt;ref name="Woman told she was too Hot to Fly"&gt;NBC News.

== Cleavage enhancement ==
{{Main|Cleavage enhancement}}
Various methods have been used by women in history to enhance their [[physical attractiveness]] and femininity including the accentuation and display of breasts within the context of fashions and norms of modesty of the time and place.

[[Corset]]s that enhanced cleavage were introduced in the mid-16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Condra, Jill. ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing Through World History,'' page 152, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, {{ISBN|0-313-33664-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 18th century, cleavage-enhancing corsets grew more dramatic in pushing the breasts upward.&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Catherine. ''Fashioning Gothic Bodies,'' page 28, Manchester University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7190-6401-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tight lacing of corsets worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries emphasized both cleavage and the size of the bust and hips. Especially evening or ball gowns were designed to display and emphasize the décolletage.&lt;ref name="Gernsheimpp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesmondMorris"/&gt;

When corsets became unfashionable, [[brassiere]]s and padding helped to project, display and emphasize the breasts. In 1893, New Yorker Marie Tucek was granted a patent for a "breast supporter," described as a modification of the corset, and was very similar to a modern [[push-up bra]] designed to support the breasts. It consisted of a plate made of metal, cardboard or other stiff material shaped to fit against the torso under the breasts, following the contour of the breasts. It was covered with silk, canvas or other cloth, which extended above the plate to form a pocket for each breast. The plate curved around the torso and ended near the armpits.&lt;ref name="Tucek"&gt;{{cite news |last=Riordan |first=Teresa |title=Patents; In bra technology, an incremental improvement can translate into comfort |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/28/business/patents-in-bra-technology-an-incremental-improvement-can-translate-into-comfort.html?sec=technology&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=2009-04-21 |date=2002-10-28 |publisher=The New York Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gHMwNkFs?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/28/business/patents-in-bra-technology-an-incremental-improvement-can-translate-into-comfort.html?sec=technology&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate=2009-04-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference | number = 494397  | y = 1893 | m = 03 | d = 28 | inventor = Marie Tucek | title = Breast Supporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hughes, the resultant amount was "the length of the actual cleavage is five and one-quarter inches."&lt;ref name=divide /&gt; Several brassiere manufacturers, among them [[Wonderbra]] and [[Victoria's Secret]], produce push-up and other types of bras that enhance cleavage. [[Frederick's of Hollywood]] introduced a design called Hollywood Extreme Cleavage Bra that helped give the impression of a spherical cleavage like augmented breasts that was popularized by stars like [[Pamela Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;Jene Luciani, ''The Bra Book'', pp=103, 140, BenBella Books Inc., 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-935251-92-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taping ===
Many women, such as beauty pageant participants and [[transgender]] people, create cleavage by using tape underneath and across their breast, bending forward, tightly pulling them together and up.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Banet-Weiser, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BsZHUu3gmV0C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=breast+cleavage+taping&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9Ys9VLOkI4KVuASCvICYAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=breast%20cleavage%20taping&amp;f=false The Most Beautiful Girl in the World: Beauty Pageants and National Identity],'' page 73, University of California Press, (1999) {{ISBN|978-0-520-21789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apaige&gt;Andy Paige, ''Style on a Shoestring,'' page 24, McGraw Hill Professional, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-07-159506-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;IV2"&gt;JoAnn Roberts, ''Art and Illusion: A Guide to Crossdressing'' (Vol. 2), Creative Design Services, 1994, {{ISBN|1-880715-08-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of tape used include surgical micropore tape and athletic tape. Some also use a strip of [[moleskin]] under the breasts with tape at the ends to hold it in place. Use of the wrong techniques or tape with too strong an adhesive can cause injuries such as rashes, blisters and skin being torn off.&lt;ref name=apaige /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;IV2" /&gt;

=== Surgery ===
{{Main|Breast augmentation}}

Bigger breasts are easier to push together to accent the hollow between them.&lt;ref name="scoop"/&gt; Some flat-chested women feel self-conscious about their small breasts and want to improve their sexual attractiveness by seeking [[breast augmentation]].&lt;ref name=brett&gt;{{cite news|last=Brett|first=Samantha|title=The Great Cleavage Conundrum: should men look if it's on display?|url=http://www.northernargus.com.au/blogs/national-comment/the-great-cleavage-conundrum-should-men-look-if-its-on-display/2459026.aspx?storypage=0|accessdate=17 February 2012|newspaper=Northern Argus|date=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic surgeon Gerard H. Pitman says, "you can't have cleavage with an A cup. You have to be at least a B or a C."&lt;ref name=divide /&gt; A similar statement was made for non-surgical cleavage enhancement as well (i.e. lingerie manufacturers [[Frederick's of Hollywood]] promises "high-rise cleavage to small busts" and Curvees in Etam claims to give girls with a B cup an "exciting C cup cleavage").&lt;ref name=anxiety&gt;Kristina Roberts Ellis, ''Bodies of Thought, Sites of Anxiety'', pages 82-83, ProQuest, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-549-98382-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breast surgery for emplacing [[breast implant]]s can be done for three purposes:

# primary reconstruction to replace breast tissues damaged by [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] ([[blunt trauma|blunt]], [[penetrating trauma|penetrating]], [[blast injury|blast]]), disease (breast cancer) and failed anatomic development ([[tuberous breast]] deformity).
# revision and reconstruction to revise (correct) the outcome of a previous breast reconstruction surgery.
# primary augmentation to aesthetically augment the size, form and feel of the [[breast]]s.

For [[breast reconstruction]] and for the augmentation and enhancement of the aesthetics — size, shape, and texture — of a woman's breasts, there are two types of breast implant devices in practice: saline implants filled with sterile [[saline (medicine)|saline solution]] and silicone implants filled with viscous [[silicone]] gel.

If a surgeon attempts to create or increase cleavage by loosening the medial borders of the breasts, it could result in [[symmastia]], a confluence of the breast tissue of both breasts across the midline anterior to the [[Human sternum|sternum]], creating a lack of defined cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;Iliana E. Sweis, ''Outsmarting Mother Nature,'' page 163, ABC-CLIO, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-313-38614-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Procedures are generally followed during [[breast reconstruction]] to preserve a natural cleavage of breasts.&lt;ref&gt;Jay R. Harris, Marc E. Lippman, C. Kent Osborne and Monica Morrow, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GLc8xYe239kC&amp;pg=PT1448&amp;lpg=PT1448&amp;dq=intermammary+succulus+pathology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zb2PvcRnK1&amp;sig=AkGgy-yKvAl3pgJSsUB4nENhuXg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iLhVVKfFA8TguQT7s4CYAg&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Diseases of the Breast],'' Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4511-4870-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exercise ===
Regular exercise of the muscles and fibres of the pectoral complex, which lies just under the fatty tissues of the breast, helps prevent droopiness and can create the illusion of larger and firmer breasts and an enhanced cleavage.&lt;ref name=bmars&gt;Brigitte Mars, ''Beauty by Nature'', page 136, Book Publishing Company, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-57067-193-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christine Lydon, ''Look Hot, Live Long'', page 198, Basic Health Publications, Inc., 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-59120-024-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joyce L.

Making cleavage appear deeper and the breasts look fuller alongside the cleavage with makeup is achieved using [[shading]] effects.

After a recurring role as Bliss from 2011 to 2013 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s television series ''[[Suburgatory]]'', Deena was cast in another recurring role as Margaret Montrose, the mother of [[Grey Damon]], on the new sci fi alien drama ''[[Star-Crossed (TV series)|Star-Crossed]]'' (2014) on The CW.

Dill is one of the creators and executive producers of the CW's game show, ''[[Oh Sit!]]'', alongside Phil Gurin and Richard Joel.

'''''Dialogues with Madwomen''''' is a 1993 [[Documentary film|documentary]] by [[Allie Light]] focusing on [[mental illness]] in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmm.com/filmcatalog/pages/c141.shtml | title=Dialogues with Madwomen | publisher=''[[Women Make Movies]]'' | accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In ''Dialogues with Madwomen'', filmmakers Allie Light and Irving Saraf have seven "madwomen" — including Light herself — into telling their stories. Using a mixture of home movies, archival footage of [[psychiatric]] wards, re-enactments, and interviews with their subjects, Light and Saraf have created a complex, moving portrait of women in whom [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[multiple personalities]] coexist with powerful, sometimes inspired levels of creativity.

There are many methods for teaching [[Drama]].  Each strategy involves varying levels of student participation.

==Drama games==
Drama games, activities and exercises are often used to introduce students to drama.  These activities tend to be less intrusive and are highly participatory (e.g. [[Bang (Drama Game)|Bang]]).

There are several books that have been written on using drama games that can serve as excellent resources for anyone wanting to incorporate drama games into their work. [[Augusto Boal|Games for Actors and Non-Actors]] by [[Augusto Boal]] is perhaps the best known internationally and includes writings on his life work as well as hundreds of games. There are also smaller books however, which serve as excellent practical guides. For example, Drama Games by [[Bernie Warren]] is an excellent pocket book for someone looking to try drama games for the first time.

==Choral speaking==
Choral dramatization involves students reading aloud by assigning parts to each group member.  Choral dramatization can use texts such as [[rhymes]], [[poetry]], and [[picture books]].  Students can experiment with voice, sound gesture and movement (Swartz, 1995).

==Tableaux==
[[Tableau vivant|Tableaux]] involve students creating visual pictures with their bodies, emphasizing key details and relationships (Wilheim, 2002). Tableaux are frozen scenes and usually involve at least three levels.  Students focus on a focal point, facial expressions, and body language.  This technique is useful for maturing participants' presentational skills as well as audience skills.

==Improvisation==
[[Improvisation]] is the practice of acting and reacting, of making and creating, in the moment and in response to the stimulus of one’s immediate environment; see [[Improvisation|Wikipedia: Improvisation]]. Improvisation can be a great introduction to role playing.  Students focus on position, expression and creativity in their impromptu skits.

==Role playing==
Role playing allows students to play a [[Character (arts)|character]] in a real or imaginary situation.  One of the simplest forms is where “the student plays himself faced with an imaginary situation.” (Wilheim, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;62) Other strategies have students playing real-life or imaginary characters in a variety of contexts.  Role play can be used throughout many areas of the curriculum, especially [[history]] and [[language arts]] to support and strengthen understanding of content.  Below is a list of some common role-play strategies.

* [[Historical reenactment|Reenactment]]: Students perform scenes from a historical time period or a scene in a story.  “An enactment may be cast in the past, the present, or the future, but always happens in the ‘now of time’” (Wilheim, 2002, p.8).  This strategy encourages students to interact with a text and challenges them to take on the [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] of a character.
* Extended role play: Students may create the scene that takes place before or after a story or scene.  This strategy helps students to predict and theorize about cause and effect.
* Hotseat: Student is interviewed in character.  By putting the character from a scene, event or story on the “stand” students can further explore their understanding of the content.  Other students in the class prepare questions that explore the character and their conflicts.  Students are encouraged to write open-ended questions.  Teachers may wish to model hotseating first by acting as the character in the role.  Also, the person in the hotseat may have a couple of students who act as their “brain.”  They are there to help answer questions if the person on the hotseat needs them.  There are many variations available for this strategy.
* Teacher In Role: This strategy is key to involving teacher participation.  This strategy can take on many forms.  The teacher may take on the role of a character or figure from the event, scene or story.  The primary objective of this strategy is to allow students to ask questions and help discover answers to any unresolved issues.  The teacher may also choose to immerse themselves in the scene and take on a role while interacting with other characters.  The primary role in this situation is to further the evolving drama.
* Expert panel: Students themselves become an [[expert]].  In order to prepare for this role students must determine what an expert in the area might know.  This works well in history or when focusing on broader issues/topics in literature.  This strategy can unfold by having students meet as a group of experts or by having students meet in pairs in an [[interview]] situation.
* Writing in role: A variation on the above strategies, students may also write in character.  Often they are asked to imagine themselves as a real or fictitious character in a particular state or situation.  Writing in role can take on many forms including a journal, letter, monologue, or newspaper article.  This is not meant to be a summary of the story, but instead a further exploration of the character and their interaction with events.

[[File:Samba Collection.JPG|thumb|Samba, a furniture created by [[Guto Requena]] with generative design.]]
'''Generative design''' is an [[Iteration|iterative]] [[design]] [[Process (engineering)|process]] that involves a [[Computer program|program]] that will [[Generator (mathematics)|generate]] a certain number of [[Output (computing)|outputs]] that meet certain [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]], and a [[designer]] that will fine tune the [[feasible region]] by changing [[Maxima and minima|minimal and maximal]] values of an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] in which a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] of the program meets the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of constraints, in order to reduce or augment the number of outputs to [[Choice|choose]] from. The program doesn't need to be run on a [[machine]] like a [[digital computer]], it can be run by a human for example with [[pen and paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.evaburger.at/portfolio/generative-design-with-analogue-techniques/|title=generative design with analogue techniques – eva designs|website=www.evaburger.at|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designer doesn't need to be a [[human]], it can be a [[Test (assessment)|test]] program in a testing environment or an [[artificial intelligence]] (see for example [[Generative adversarial network|Generative adversarial networks]]). The designer [[Learning|learns]] to [[Refinement (computing)|refine]] the program (usually involving [[Algorithm|algorithms]]) with each iteration as his design [[Goal|goals]] become better [[Definition|defined]] over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cimdata.com/en/news/item/8402-generative-design-what-s-that|title=“Generative Design” – What’s That? - CIMdata|last=Meintjes|first=Keith|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.autodesk.com/solutions/generative-design|title=What is Generative Design {{!}} Tools &amp; Software {{!}} Autodesk|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-generative-design-anthony-hauck|title=What is Generative Design?|date=2018-04-09|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designbyming.com/relational-design-thinking/|title=Relational Design Thinking — Design by Ming|website=designbyming.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The output could be [[Image|images]], [[Sound|sounds]], [[Architectural model|architectural models]], [[animation]], and much more. It is therefore a fast method of exploring design possibilities that is used in various design fields such as [[art]], [[architecture]], [[Communication Design|communication design]], and [[Product Design|product design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engineering.com/DesignSoftware/DesignSoftwareArticles/ArticleID/16973/Generative-Design-The-Road-to-Production.aspx|title=Generative Design: The Road to Production|last=ENGINEERING.com|website=www.engineering.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process combined with the [[Computing power|power]] of digital computers that can explore a very large number of possible [[Permutation|permutations]] of a solution enables designers to generate and test brand new options, beyond what a human alone could accomplish, to arrive at a most effective and optimized design. It [[Biomimetics|mimics nature]]’s [[evolutionary]] approach to design through [[genetic variation]] and [[Selection (biology)|selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autodesk.com/customer-stories/airbus|title=Definition adapted from a product developed by Autodesk named Generative Design|website=Autodesk|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generative design is becoming more important, largely due to new programming environments or scripting capabilities that have made it relatively easy, even for designers with little programming experience, to implement their ideas. Additionally, this process can create solutions to substantially complex problems that would otherwise be resource-exhaustive with an alternative approach making it a more attractive option for problems with a large or unknown solution set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1003551283|title=Compositional model-based design: A generative approach to the conceptual design of physical systems|last=Prasanta|first=Rajamoney, Shankar A.

Not only are implementation tools becoming more accessible but also tools leveraging generative design as a foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Fraser|last2=Grossman|first2=Tovi|last3=Fitzmaurice|first3=George|date=2017-10-20|title=Trigger-Action-Circuits: Leveraging Generative Design to Enable Novices to Design and Build Circuitry|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3126594.3126637|publisher=ACM|pages=331–342|doi=10.1145/3126594.3126637|isbn=9781450349819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Girls Can't Swim''' ({{lang-fr|'''Les Filles ne savent pas nager'''}}) is a 2000 [[France|French]] [[coming of age]]  [[drama film]]. It was first shown at the 2000 [[Montreal Film Festival]].

==Plot==
Gwen ([[Isild Le Besco]]) is a teenager living in a coastal town in Brittany; Lise ([[Karen Alyx]]) is her city-living best friend. They meet up each summer as Lise's family visits.
This year's visit is different though - Lise is dealing with her distant father's death, and Gwen has become promiscuous with boys - with the tensions affecting their friendship.

==Cast==
* [[Isild Le Besco]] as Gwen
* [[Karen Alyx]] as Lise
* [[Pascale Bussières]] as Céline
* [[Pascal Elso]] as Alain
* [[Marie Rivière]] as Anne-Marie
* [[Yelda Reynaud]] as Solange
* [[Sandrine Blancke]] as Vivianne
* [[Julien Cottereau]] as Frédo
* [[Dominique Lacarrière]] as Rose

==Reception==
Stephen Holden of the [[New York Times]] said "''Girls Can't Swim'' ultimately lacks the epic dimension of ''[[Y Tu Mamá También]],'' but its vision of that awkward age when sex threatens to overwhelm everything else is acute enough to make everyone who has been there squirm with recognition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/19/movies/film-review-two-girls-and-a-boy-swept-away-by-themselves.html |title=FILM REVIEW; Two Girls and a Boy Swept Away by Themselves|publisher=www.nytimes.com |accessdate=2011-02-05 |author= Stephen Holden|date= 2002-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two stars, saying "The phrase "coming of age," when applied to movies, almost always implies sex, but ''Girls Can't Swim'' has nothing useful to say about sex (certainly not compared to [[Catherine Breillat]]'s brilliant ''[[Fat Girl]]'' from last year), and is too jerky in structure to inspire much empathy from us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020809/REVIEWS/208090302/1023 |title= Girls Can't Swim|publisher= rogerebert.suntimes.com |accessdate= 2011-02-05|date= 2002-08-09|author= Roger Ebert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hval's Codex''' ({{lang-sh|Hvalov zbornik}}/Хвалов зборник) or '''Hval's Manuscript''' (''Hvalov rukopis''/Хвалов рукопис) is a [[Cyrillic]] [[manuscript]] of 353 pages written in 1404, in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], for Duke [[Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić]].&lt;ref name=Basler&gt;{{cite book|author=Đuro Basler|title=The Art treasures of Bosnia and Herzegovina|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6OfAAAAMAAJ|date=1 December 1987|publisher=Svjetlost|quote=Two manuscripts are of exceptional value: Hval's Codex and the Hrvoje Missal.

It was written in 1404 by [[Bosnian Church|''krstjanin'']] Hval in [[Cyrillic]] in the [[Ikavian accent]] with a [[Glagolitic alphabet]] introduction and is decorated with [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] and other artistic elements.&lt;ref name="Ethnicity-Did-Not-Matter"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fine|first1=John V.

&lt;!--[[File:Hval.jpg|thumb|left|A miniature from the Hval Manuscript]]--&gt;
The codex is one of the most famous manuscripts belonging to the [[Bosnian Church]] in which there are some [[iconographic]] elements which are not in concordance with the supposed theological doctrine of Christians (Annunciation, Crucifixion and Ascension). All of the important Bosnian Church books ''(Nikoljsko evandjelje, Sreckovicevo evandelje, the Manuscript of Hval, the Manuscript of Krstyanin Radosav)'' are based on Glagolitic Church books.&lt;ref name="Tradition-Betrayed"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Donia|first1=Robert J.|last2=Fine|first2=John Van Antwerp|title=Bosnia and Hercegovina: A Tradition Betrayed|publisher=Hurst|isbn=9781850652120|url=https://books.google.ba/books?id=0rIGA0rluO0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Tradition+Betrayed+Robert+J.+Donia,+John+Van+Antwerp+Fine&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0tLfg84nPAhVHxRQKHbSZAEcQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20Tradition%20Betrayed%20Robert%20J.%20Donia%2C%20John%20Van%20Antwerp%20Fine&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New analyses of style and painting techniques show that they were inscribed by at least two miniaturists. One painter was painting on the blue background, and the other was painting on the gold background in which the miniatures are situated in a rich architectonic frame.

The Hval Manuscript is kept in the [[University of Bologna|University Library]] in [[Bologna]], [[Italy]].

In [[mathematics]], an '''isometry''' (or '''[[congruence (geometry)|congruence]]''', or '''congruent transformation''') is a [[distance]]-preserving transformation between [[metric spaces]], usually assumed to be [[Bijection|bijective]].&lt;ref name=CoxeterIsometryDef&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1969|page=29}} &lt;p&gt;"We shall find it convenient to use the word ''transformation'' in the special sense of a one-to-one correspondence &lt;math&gt; P \to P'&lt;/math&gt; among all points in the plane (or in space), that is, a rule for associating pairs of points, with the understanding that each pair has a first member {{mvar|P}} and a second member {{mvar|P'}} and that every point occurs as the first member of just one pair and also as the second member of just one pair...&lt;p&gt;In particular, an ''isometry'' (or "congruent transformation," or "congruence") is a transformation which preserves length..."&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Academ Reflections with parallel axis on wallpaper.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|A [[Function composition|composition]] of two [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|opposite]] isometries is a direct isometry.  [[Reflection (mathematics)|A reflection]] in a line is an opposite isometry, like  {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt; 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}  or {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt; 2&lt;/sub&gt;}}  on the image. [[Translation (geometry)|Translation]] {{math|''T''}} is a direct isometry: [[Rigid body|a rigid motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1969|p=46}} &lt;p&gt;'''3.51''' ''Any direct isometry is either a translation or a rotation. Any opposite isometry is either a reflection or a glide reflection.''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Introduction==
Given a metric space (loosely, a set and a scheme for assigning distances between elements of the set), an isometry is a [[Transformation (geometry)|transformation]] which maps elements to the same or another metric space such that the distance between the image elements in the new metric space is equal to the distance between the elements in the original metric space. In a two-dimensional or three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], two geometric figures are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] if they are related by an isometry;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1969|page=39}}&lt;p&gt;'''3.11''' ''Any two congruent triangles are related by a unique isometry.''&lt;/ref&gt; the isometry that relates them is either a rigid motion (translation or rotation), or a [[Function composition|composition]] of a rigid motion and a [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]].&lt;!--commentary: i presume "they" here means the geometric figures. still commenting out because it doesn't seem to help.--&gt; &lt;!--They are equal, up to an action of a rigid motion, if related by a [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|direct isometry]] (orientation preserving).--&gt;

Isometries are often used in constructions where one space is [[Embedding|embedded]] in another space. For instance, the [[Complete space#Completion|completion]] of a metric space ''M'' involves an isometry from ''M'' into ''M''', a [[quotient set]] of the space of [[Cauchy sequence]]s on ''M''. The original space ''M'' is thus isometrically [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a subspace of a [[complete metric space]], and it is usually identified with this subspace. Other embedding constructions show that every metric space is isometrically isomorphic to a [[closed set|closed subset]] of some [[normed vector space]] and that every complete metric space is isometrically isomorphic to a closed subset of some [[Banach space]].

An isometric surjective linear operator on a [[Hilbert space]] is called a [[unitary operator]].

==Formal definitions==

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[metric space]]s with metrics ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;. A [[function (mathematics)|map]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is called an '''isometry''' or '''distance preserving''' if for any ''a'',''b'' ∈ ''X'' one has

:&lt;math&gt;d_Y\left(f(a),f(b)\right)=d_X(a,b).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

An isometry is automatically [[Injective function|injective]];&lt;ref name=CoxeterIsometryDef/&gt; otherwise two distinct points, ''a'' and ''b'', could be mapped to the same point, thereby contradicting the coincidence axiom of the metric ''d''. This proof is similar to the proof that an [[order embedding]] between [[partially ordered set]]s is injective. Clearly, every isometry between metric spaces is a topological embedding.

A '''global isometry''', '''isometric isomorphism''' or '''congruence mapping''' is a [[bijective]] isometry. Like any other bijection, a global isometry has a [[function inverse]].  The inverse of a global isometry is also a global isometry.

Two metric spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' are called '''isometric''' if there is a bijective isometry from ''X'' to ''Y''. The [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of bijective isometries from a metric space to itself forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] with respect to [[function composition]], called the '''[[isometry group]]'''.

There is also the weaker notion of ''path isometry'' or ''arcwise isometry'':

A '''path isometry''' or '''arcwise isometry''' is a map which preserves the [[Arc length#Definition|lengths of curves]]; such a map is not necessarily an isometry in the distance preserving sense, and it need not necessarily be bijective, or even injective. This term is often abridged to simply ''isometry'', so one should take care to determine from context which type is intended.

* Any [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]], [[translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[rotation]] is a global isometry on Euclidean spaces. See also [[Euclidean group#Overview of isometries in up to three dimensions|Euclidean group]].
*The map &lt;math&gt; x\mapsto |x|&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt; is a path isometry but not an isometry.  Note that unlike an isometry, it is not injective.
*The isometric [[linear map]]s from '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to itself are given by the [[unitary matrix|unitary matrices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Roweis | first1 = S.

==Linear isometry==

Given two [[normed vector space]]s ''V'' and ''W'', a '''linear isometry''' is a [[linear map]] ''f'' : ''V'' → ''W'' that preserves the norms:
:&lt;math&gt;\|f(v)\| = \|v\|&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''v'' in ''V''.&lt;ref name="Thomsen 2017 p125"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomsen |first=Jesper Funch |date=2017 |title=Lineær algebra |trans-title=Linear algebra |page=125 |language=Danish |location=Århus |publisher=Department of Mathematics, Aarhus University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linear isometries are distance-preserving maps in the above sense. They are global isometries if and only if they are [[surjective]].

By the [[Mazur-Ulam theorem]], any isometry of normed vector spaces over '''R''' is [[Affine transformation|affine]].

In an inner product space, the fact that any linear isometry is an orthogonal transformation can be shown by using [[Polarization identity|polarization identities]] to
prove ''&lt;Ax, Ay&gt; = &lt;x, y&gt;''&lt;ref name="Thomsen 2017 p125"/&gt; and then applying the [[Riesz representation theorem]].

==Generalizations==
* Given a positive real number ε, an '''ε-isometry''' or '''almost isometry''' (also called a '''[[Felix Hausdorff|Hausdorff]] approximation''') is a map &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; between metric spaces such that
*# for ''x'',''x''&amp;prime; ∈ ''X'' one has |''d''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;(ƒ(''x''),ƒ(''x''&amp;prime;))&amp;minus;''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''x''&amp;prime;)| &lt; ε, and
*# for any point ''y'' ∈ ''Y'' there exists a point ''x'' ∈ ''X'' with ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'',ƒ(''x'')) &lt; ε

:That is, an ε-isometry preserves distances to within ε and leaves no element of the codomain further than ε away from the image of an element of the domain.  Note that ε-isometries are not assumed to be [[continuous function|continuous]].

*The '''[[restricted isometry property]]''' characterizes nearly isometric matrices for sparse vectors.
*'''[[Quasi-isometry]]''' is yet another useful generalization.
* One may also define an element in an abstract unital C*-algebra to be an isometry: 
*:&lt;math&gt; a\in\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an isometry if and only if &lt;math&gt; a^* \cdot a = 1 &lt;/math&gt;.
:Note that as mentioned in the introduction this is not necessarily a unitary element because one does not in general have that left inverse is a right inverse.

*On a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]], the term ''isometry'' means a linear bijection preserving magnitude. See also [[Quadratic form#Quadratic spaces|Quadratic spaces]].

'''''Kinflicks''''' (1976) is a [[novel]] by [[United States of America|American]] writer [[Lisa Alther]]. It was Alther's first published work, and the "subject of considerable pre-publication hyperbole."&lt;ref name="time76"/&gt;

==Plot summary==
The novel starts with a first-person reflection on her life so far by the protagonist, Virginia "Ginny" Hull Babcock Bliss, as she catches a plane to look after her gravely ill mother.  From then on, dated chapters in [[Narrative mode#Third-person.2C subjective|third person]] alternate with Ginny's non-linear [[Narrative mode#First-person narrative mode|first-person]] reminiscences of her childhood, her teenage years, her [[college]] years, her [[marriage]], and beyond.

==Publication==
The first printing consisted of 30,000 copies, and was chosen as an alternate selection of the [[Book of the Month Club]].&lt;ref name="time76"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,911795,00.html | title= Books: Blue Genes | date= March 22, 1976 | author= Paul Gray | publisher= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| accessdate= 2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was "the subject of considerable pre-publication hyperbole..., soaring in the slip stream of ''[[Fear of Flying (novel)|Fear of Flying]]'', [[Erica Jong]]'s bestselling [[I Sing the Body Electric (Whitman)|hymn to the body electric]]. The novel proves again&amp;mdash;if any doubters still remain&amp;mdash;that women can write about physical functions just as frankly and, when the genes move them, as raunchily as men. It strikes a blow for the [[picaresque novel|picara]] by putting a heroine through the same paces that once animated a [[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]] or a [[Holden Caulfield]]. And it suggests that life seen from what was once called the distaff side suspiciously resembles the genitalia-centered existence that male novelists have so long monopolized."&lt;ref name="time76"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[List of Nobel Laureates in Literature|Nobel laureate]] [[Doris Lessing]] wrote of ''Kinflicks'' that Alther was "a strong, salty, original talent."&lt;ref name=FoylesCoUK_Reviews_DorisLessing_Kinflicks&gt;
{{cite web

 |accessdate = 2009-01-03
}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' called it an "abundantly entertaining progress through the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|unsettled 60s]]" and noted that "as exuberant [[caricature]] ''Kinflicks'' is authentically inspired"; while the novel "teems with cartoon eccentrics mouthing balloonfuls of inflated nonsense[, u]nhappily, Ginny [the protagonist] is equally one dimensional."&lt;ref name="time76"/&gt;

More than 30 years after its publication, [[Katherine Dieckmann]], reviewing the author's 2007 memoir, also commented on ''Kinflicks'', calling it a "raucous novel [that] was all the rage among my high school set for its lurid paperback cover (nude female back, gilt lettering) and its frank talk of erections and lesbian hook-ups. Revisiting the novel 30 years later, it’s clear the packaging sold the contents short: Alther’s best-known book is a witty [[coming-of-age]] tale in which a tart-tongued protagonist named Ginny wanders her way through an identity crisis, mostly against a classic [[counterculture]] background."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/books/review/Dieckmann-t.html |title= Mountain People | date=May 13, 2007 | publisher= The New York Times | accessdate= 2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Kraków Dance Theatre''' ('''''Krakowski Teatr Tańca''''') is a [[Contemporary dance|dance theatre]] that evolved in 2008 from the GRUPAboso Dance Theatre (founded in 1996) and works under the artistic direction of Eryk Makohon at the Nowa Huta Centre of Culture in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]].

In 2008 the Krakowski Teatr Tańca GRUPAboso Association was established, whose aim is to support the artistic and educational activities of the Theatre.

In 2010 the METAphysical Laboratory was established as the source of new [[dancer]]s. The students-dancers of the Laboratory have become the guest dancers of the Theatre and they have an opportunity to create their own [[Choreography|choreographies]] with a professional support.

Some of the company's awards were won at: the Tychy Theatre Meetings (2007, 2009), the Polish Contemporary Dance Confrontation in [[Konin]] (2009), the Polish edition of the Solo &amp; Duo Dance Festival (2009 and 2010). Additionally, the company represented Poland at the 13th Biennial of Young Artists from [[Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean]], which took place in May 2008 in [[Bari]] ([[Italy]]).

The '''Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie''' (or '''la Monnaie''') in [[French language|French]], or The '''Koninklijke Muntschouwburg''' (or '''de Munt''') in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], is an Opera house in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. Both of its names translate as Royal Theatre of the Mint.

Today the National Opera of Belgium, a federal institution, takes the name of the theatre in which it is housed. Therefore, ''la Monnaie'' or ''de Munt'' refers both to the structure as well as the opera company.

As Belgium's leading [[opera house]] it is one of the few cultural institutions which receives financial support from the federal government of Belgium. Other opera houses in Belgium, such as the [[Vlaamse Opera]] and the [[Opéra Royal de Wallonie]], are funded by regional governments.

== History ==
In the last three decades la Monnaie has regained its place amongst the foremost opera houses in Europe thanks to the efforts of the successive directors [[Gerard Mortier]] and [[Bernard Foccroulle]] and music directors [[Sylvain Cambreling]] and [[Antonio Pappano]].

The current edifice is the third theatre on the site. The façade dates from 1818 with major alterations made in 1856 and 1986. The foyer and auditorium date from 1856, but almost every other element of the present building was extensively renovated in the 1980s.

===The theatre of Gio-Paolo Bombarda, 1700 to 1818===
The first permanent public theatre for opera performances of the court and city of Brussels was built between 1695 and 1700 by the Venetian architects Paolo and Pietro Bezzi, as part of a rebuilding plan following the [[bombardment of Brussels]]. It was built on the site of a building that had served to mint coins. The name of this site ''la Monnaie'' ("the Mint") remained attached to the theatre for the centuries to come. The construction of the theatre had been ordered by [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]], at that time [[Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands]]. The Elector had charged his ''"trésorier"'', the Italian [[Gio-Paolo Bombarda]], with the task of financing and supervising the enterprise. The date of the first performance in 1700 remains unknown.

The first performance mentioned in the local newspaper was [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s, ''[[Atys (Lully)|Atys]]'', which was given on 19 November 1700. The French operatic repertoire would dominate the Brussels stage throughout the following century, although performances of Venetian operas and other non-French repertoire were performed on a regular basis. Until the middle of the 19th century, plays were performed along with opera, ballet and concerts.

By the 18th century ''la Monnaie'' was considered the second French-speaking stage after the most prominent theatres in Paris. Under the rule of [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine]], who acted as a very generous patron of the arts, the theatre greatly flourished. At that time it housed an opera company, a ballet and an orchestra. The splendour of the performances diminished during the last years of the Austrian rule, due to the severe politics of the Austrian [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]].

After 1795, when the French revolutionary forces occupied the Belgian provinces, the theatre became a French Departmental institution.

Amongst other cuts in its expenses, the theatre had to abolish its ''Corps de Ballet''. During this period many famous French actors and singers gave regular performances in the theatre during their tour of the provinces of the Empire. Still a consul, Napoleon on his visit to Brussels judged the old theatre too dilapidated for one of the most prestigious cities of his Empire. He ordered plans to replace the old building by a new and more monumental edifice, but nothing was done during the Napoleonic rule. Finally, the plans were carried out under the auspices of the new [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] and the Bombarda building was demolished in 1818.

===The theatre of Louis Damesme, 1818 to 1855===
[[File:Salle du Theatre Royal de la Monnaie 1 © Philippe De Gobert.jpg|thumb|Grand room at Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels, Belgium.]]

The old theatre was replaced by a new Neo-classical building designed by the French architect [[Louis Damesme]]. Unlike the Bombarda building, which was situated along the street and completely surrounded by other buildings, the new theatre was placed in the middle of a newly constructed square. This gave it a more monumental appearance, but it was primarily the result of safety concerns since it was more accessible to firemen, reducing the chance that fire would spread to surrounding buildings. The new auditorium was inaugurated on 25 May 1819 with the opera ''La Caravane du Caire'' by the Belgian composer [[André Ernest Modeste Grétry]].

As the most important French theatre of the newly established [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], la Monnaie had national and international significance. The theatre came under the supervision of the city of Brussels, which had the right to appoint a director charged with the management its management. In this period famous actors like [[François Joseph Talma]] and singers like [[Maria Malibran]] performed at ''la Monnaie''. The ''Corps de Ballet'' was reintroduced and came under the supervision of the dancer and choreographer [[Jean-Antoine Petipa]], father of the famous [[Marius Petipa]].

La Monnaie would play a prominent role in the formation of the [[Kingdom of Belgium]]. [[Daniel Auber]]'s opera ''[[La Muette de Portici]]'' was scheduled in August 1830 after it had been banned from the stage by King William I, fearing its inciting content. At a performance of this opera on the evening of 25 August 1830, a riot broke out which became the signal for the [[Belgian Revolution]] and which led to Belgian independence. The Damesme building continued to serve for more than two decades as Belgium's principal theatre and opera house until it burnt to the ground on 21 January 1855 leaving only the outside walls and portico.

===The theatre of Joseph Poelaert, since 1856===
After the fire of January 1855, the theatre was reconstructed after the designs of [[Joseph Poelaert]] within a period of fourteen months. The auditorium (with 1,200 seats) and the [[foyer]] were decorated in a then-popular [[Eclecticism in art|Eclectic]] Style; a mixture of [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]], [[Neo-Rococo]] and [[Neo-Renaissance]] Styles. The lavish decoration made excessive use of gilded "carton-pierre" decorations and sculptures, red velvet and brocade. The auditorium was lit by the huge crystal chandelier that today still hangs in the centre of the domed ceiling. It is made of gilded bronze and venetian crystals. The original dome painting&amp;nbsp;– representing "Belgium Protecting the Arts"&amp;nbsp;– was painted in the Parisian workshop of François-Joseph Nolau (Paris 1804-1883) and Auguste-Alfred Rubé (Paris, 1815-1899), two famous decorators of the Parisian Opera House. In 1887 this dome painting was completely repainted by Auguste-Alfred Rubé (Paris, 1815-1899) himself and his new associate Philippe-Marie Chaperon (Paris, 1826–1907), because it was mostly tainted by the CO2 emissions from the chandelier. This dome painting stayed untouched until 1985, when it was taken down during extensive rebuilding activities and replaced by a bad copy, painted by the Belgian painter Xavier Crolls. From 1988 until 1998 the dome painting of Rubé and Chaperon was in restoration. In 1999, it was reinstated and decorates today one of the most beautiful opera houses of Europe. The sober whitewashed exterior we see today was done many decades later. Poelaert never intended to whitewash these outer walls. In 1856, the exterior did not have any whitewashing at all, which is proved by many photographs of that time.

The new ''Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie'' opened on 25 March 1856 with [[Fromental Halévy]]’s ''[[Jaguarita l'Indienne]]''. In the middle of the 19th century the repertoire was dominated by the popular French composers such as Halévy, [[Daniel Auber]], and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], and the Italian composers, [[Gioachino Rossini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]] and [[Giuseppe Verdi]] who had considerable success in Paris.

===The opera house in the 20th century===


Renovations on the Poelaert building were required shortly after the opening due to faulty foundation work; the early 20th century saw an additional story added; and in the 1950s, a new stage building was added. By 1985 it was determined that complete renovation was needed. Features such as raising the roofline by 4 metres and scooping out the stage building area  - in addition to creating a steel frame to strengthen the load-bearing walls and increasing backstage space -  characterized this two-year project. However, the red and gold auditorium remained basically the same. The canvas of the ceiling painting was temporarily removed for restoration and only put back in 1999. It was temporarily replaced by a copy in much brighter colors that was painted directly on the stucco ceiling.

The entrance hall and the grand staircase underwent a radical makeover, although original features such as the monument by Belgian sculptor [[Paul Du Bois]] honouring manager and musical director Dupont (1910), and a number of monumental paintings (1907-1933) by [[Emile Fabry]] were preserved. The [[Liège]] architect [[Charles Vandenhove]] created a new architectural concept for the entrance in 1985-86. He asked two American artists to make a contribution: [[Sol LeWitt]] designed a fan-shaped floor in black and white marble, while [[Sam Francis]] painted a triptych mounted to the ceiling. Vandenhove also designed a new interior decoration for the ''Salon Royal'', a reception room connected to the Royal box. For this project he collaborated with the French artist [[Daniel Buren]].

Now seating 1,125, the renovated opera house was inaugurated on 12 November 1986 with a performance of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]’s ''[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]]''.

In 1998 the major part of the vacant Vanderborght Department Store building (c. 20,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and a neo-classical mansion, both situated directly behind the opera house, were acquired by la Monnaie. The edifices were renovated and adapted to house the technical and administrative facilities of la Monnaie, previously spread all over the city. The building also contains large rehearsal halls for opera, the ''Malibran'', and orchestra, the ''Fiocco''. They can also be adapted for presenting public performances.

===La Monnaie in the 21st century===

The opera house was renovated again from may 2015 to september 2017: the stage was levelled, a new fly system was put in place and two scene lifts were installed. This allowed the opera house to stage more technically demanding productions. Although most of the renovations happened backstage, the opera house took the opportunity to replace all of its worn out seats and replace it with more new, velour seats.&lt;ref&gt;VRT.

==Directors==
{{See also|List of directors of the Théâtre de la Monnaie}}
During the 1980s  [[Gerard Mortier]] was general director of ''la Monnaie''. Bernard Foccroulle succeeded Mortier in 1991 and served for fifteen seasons, maintaining and even expanding the reputation Mortier had gained in the 1980s. The current general director is Peter de Caluwe, who has been holding office since 2007.

Music Directors of ''la Monnaie'' have always played a major role in the musical life of Belgium, since the orchestra also performed in regularly organised concerts, and the quality of the orchestra reached a peak at the end of the 19th century under the baton of composer and musicologist [[Sylvain Dupuis]]. ''La Monnaie'' gave regular performances of the major works of [[Richard Wagner]] as well. During the late 19th century, important French composers  such as [[Jules Massenet]] and [[Vincent d'Indy]] directed the world premières of some of their operas at this theatre. The high musical quality of renditions was maintained under [[Corneil de Thoran]] between the two World Wars, but diminished gradually from the 1950s onwards.

At the beginning of the 1980s, [[Gérard Mortier]] engaged the French conductor [[Sylvain Cambreling]] as La Monnaie's music director, and Cambreling restored the playing of the orchestra to its former level. [[Antonio Pappano]] became music director in 1991, and during his tenure, the symphonic repertoire of the orchestra was further extended and it appeared more often in concerts outside the opera. In addition, Pappano made several recordings with the orchestra. He left in 2002 to become Music Director of the [[Royal Opera House|Royal Opera House, Covent Garden]] in London. Since 2002, the Japanese conductor [[Kazushi Ono]] has served as music director. At the end of the 2007-2008 season, Ono was scheduled to relinquish his position as ''la Monnaie'' music director to [[Mark Wigglesworth]], with Ono and Wigglesworth working together in the 2007-2008 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/4385.html | title=Mark Wigglesworth Appointed Music Director of Belgium's la Monnaie | work=Playbill Arts | author=Vivien Schweitzer | date=20 April 2006 | accessdate=2007-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in April 2008, La Monnaie announced that Wigglesworth would not take up the post of music director, after reports of opposition to him from the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a8Rsjad5Li8g | title=Feisty Orchestra Fuels Brussels Opera Changes | work=Bloomberg News | author=Shirley Apthorp | date=10 April 2008 | accessdate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2011, the company announced the appointment of [[Ludovic Morlot]] as its next music director, as of the 2012-2013 season, with an initial contract of 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Melinda Bargreen | title=New Seattle Symphony music director to moonlight in Belgium | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/thearts/2015465240_morlot30.html | work=Seattle Times | date=30 June 2011 | accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2014, citing artistic differences, Morlot resigned from the La Monnaie music directorship, effective 31 December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Serge Martin | title=Ludovic Morlot quitte la Monnaie | url=http://www.lesoir.be/732863/article/culture/musiques/2014-12-12/ludovic-morlot-quitte-monnaie | work=Le Soir | date=2014-12-12 | accessdate=2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2015, the company announced the appointment of [[Alain Altinoglu]] as its next music director, effective January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://dg0z1rj1uzap8.cloudfront.net/dbfiles/mfile/29200/29244/PERSDOSSIER_EN_09.01.pdf |title=Alain Altinoglu - Music Director of La Monnaie |publisher=Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie |date=2015-09-02 |accessdate=2015-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085342/http://dg0z1rj1uzap8.cloudfront.net/dbfiles/mfile/29200/29244/PERSDOSSIER_EN_09.01.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For performances of Baroque operas, ''la Monnaie'' mostly engages guest orchestras specialising in authentic performances on period instruments. Over the past decades [[René Jacobs]] and his [[Concerto Vocale]] have been regular guests at the theatre.

== Dance at la Monnaie ==
{{See also|List of dance directors at La Monnaie}}
Dance and ballet always had their place on the stage of ''la Monnaie'', and, during a major part of its history, the theatre housed its own ''Corps de Ballet''. Several members of the [[Petipa (disambiguation)|Petipa]] family left their mark in Brussels in the 19th-century, but the enthusiasm of the public for traditional ballet performances diminished in the 1950s.

In 1959 director [[Maurice Huisman]] embarked on a cooperation with the young Avant-Garde choreographer [[Maurice Béjart]]. This resulted in the creation of the new [[Ballet du XXième Siècle]] which became the theatre's new ballet company until 1987 when Béjart and his Ballet left ''la Monnaie'' after a conflict with [[Gérard Mortier]]. In 1988 Mortier engaged the New York choreographer [[Mark Morris (disambiguation)|Mark Morris]] and his Mark Morris Dance Group. For three years they were known as the Monnaie Dance Group Mark Morris. Morris directed several productions in Brussels until 1991. Under Bernard Foccroulle, [[Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker]] and her company [[Rosas (dance company)|Rosas]] became the dance company in residence.

|[[Adamant]] / Adamantine
|Greek mythology
|As a noun, ''adamant'' has long been used to designate any impenetrably or unyieldingly hard substance and, formerly, a legendary stone/rock or mineral of impenetrable hardness and with many other properties, often identified with [[diamond]] or [[lodestone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0007420#m_en_gb0007420 "adamant - definition of adamant"]. Oxforddictionaries.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The English word is used both as a noun and an adjective and is derived from the Latin: ''adamans'', ''adamantem'' [accusative] referring to the property of impregnable, diamondlike hardness, or to describe a very firm/resolute position, itself from the Greek word ''adamastos'' meaning untameable. Diamond is also derived from the same word. ''Adamant'' and the literary form ''adamantine'' (utilising the suffix -ine meaning 'of the nature of' or 'made of') occur in many works. In mythology Kronos was said to have used an adamantine sickle to castrate his father Uranus; in ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', Prometheus is bound to the rocks "in adamantine bonds infrangible",&lt;ref&gt;Great Books of the Western World Vol. 4 pg 40&lt;/ref&gt; in Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' (in which the gates of [[Tartarus]] are protected by columns of solid adamantine)  and in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', in which adamant and adamantine are mentioned eight times to describe the gates of hell, Satan's shield, fallen angel's armour and Satan's chains. In fiction Adamant is referred to in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' trilogy, and the games ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' and ''[[RuneScape]]'' and many more besides. Adamantine is referred to in the film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (as "adamantine steel"), in many books such as [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Mathilda (novella)|Mathilda]]'', and [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'', as well as many games including ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''. The word adamant is used as the basis for other fictional materials such as Adamantium (see below), Adamantite (see below), Adamantle (from [[the Sims]]), and [[Adiamante]] (from [[L. E. Modesitt Jr.]]'s [[Adiamante|1996 novel of the same name]]).
|-
|Adamantite
|Numerous works
|A metal ore that appears in a number of fictional universes. In ''Final Fantasy'' it is a material used to create armour, its source being from another world and its properties including being able to contain great amounts of energy. In ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', it is an uncommon ore used to produce weapons and armour of uncommon, rare and epic grade. In the ''Dark Elf'' book series by Salvatore set in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' universe it is used to create drow weaponry. It is also used for armour in ''[[The Elder Scrolls III]]'', and in the game ''[[Terraria]]'' it is a red ore used to produce armour and other items besides. The word is an extension of the English noun and adjective ''[[adamant]]'' (see entry above) adding the suffix '-ite' which is often used to form the names of minerals.
|-
|[[Adamantium]]
|[[Marvel Comics]]
|A fictional metal alloy that appears in the [[Marvel Universe]], first appearing in Marvel Comics' ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #66 (July 1969),  by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artists [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] and [[Syd Shores]]. Although it is first presented as part of the character [[Ultron]]'s outer shell,&lt;ref name="Back38"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= February 2010|title= Ultron: The Black Sheep of the Avengers Family|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 38|pages= 23–30|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is best known as the substance bonded to the character [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s skeleton and claws.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Packer MD, ''Superheroes and Superegos: Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks'', (ABC-CLIO), 2009, {{ISBN|0313355371}}, 9780313355370, p238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marco Arnaudo (translated by Jamie Richards), ''The Myth of the Superhero'', (JHU Press), 2013, {{ISBN|1421409534}}, 9781421409535, p19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gail E. Hawisher, Cynthia L. Selfe, ''Literacy, technology, and society: confronting the issues'', (Prentice Hall), 1997, p100&lt;/ref&gt; The defining quality of adamantium is its practical indestructibility. Adamantium is not depicted as being a naturally occurring metal but rather as having been inadvertently invented by the fictional American metallurgist [[Dr. Myron MacLain]] in an attempt to recreate his prior discovery, a unique alloy of steel and [[vibranium]]. Despite its potential applications in armament and armature, adamantium is rarely used due to its high cost and inability to be reshaped. Other forms of adamantium of varying durability are mentioned within the Marvel Universe, including Secondary Adamantium, Adamantium Beta and Carbonadium.&lt;ref&gt;David Bell, Barbara M. Kennedy (ed), ''The Cybercultures Reader'', (Psychology Press), 2000, {{ISBN|0415183790}}, 9780415183796, p114&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from [[Ultron]]'s outer shell and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s skeleton and claws, Adamantium is associated with a number of other characters and implements including, but not limited to, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]]'s spinal column, certain iterations of [[Captain America]]'s shield&lt;ref&gt;Seth Godin, ''The Encyclopedia of Fictional People: The Most Important Characters of the 20th Century'' , (Boulevard Books), 1996, {{ISBN|1572970731}}, 9781572970731, p4&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lady Deathstrike]]'s skeleton and talons. The word is an extension of the English noun and adjective ''[[adamant]]'' (see entry above) adding the Neo-Latin '-ium' to denote a metallic name. Adamantium is also used in the [[Games Workshop]] universe of ''[[Warhammer 40000]]'' and the [[MMORPG]] ''[[Maplestory]]''.

|[[Administratium]]
|Scientific [[in-joke]]
|First referenced in a 1989 issue of ''The Physics Teacher''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/administ.htm |title=Administratium. New chemical Element Discovered |first=William |last=DeBuvitz |publisher= The Physics Teacher |date=January 1989 |accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was apparently discovered by the fictional Thomas Kyle, who was awarded an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for [[physics]] for his discovery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V111/N40/ignobe.40n.html |title=Ig Nobel Prizes Debut |publisher=The Tech |first=Alice |last=Gilchrist |issue=40 |volume=111 |date=October 4, 1991 |accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is a parody on [[bureaucracy]] of [[academia|scientific establishments]] and on descriptions of newly discovered [[chemical element]]s.
|-
|[[Administrontium]]
|Scientific [[in-joke]]
|Similar to [[Administratium]] and a variation of the joke. It was referenced in a 1993 print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ebeltz.net/resume/jir.html |title=Physics Non-Department First to Photograph New Element. |first=Ellin |last=Beltz |publisher=NEIU Independent |date=June 21, 1993 |accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|- id="Table row aether"
|Aether
|''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''
|A powerful substance in the MtG multiverse that is found on every plane, but abundant on the plane of Kaladesh. It is part of the "aethercycle", similar to the [[water cycle]], and can be used to power everything from bikes to [[colossus (Magic: The Gathering)|colossus]]es. That is, after it is purified using the new distillation process which separates pure aether and its volatile counterpart, aetherflux.
In the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV, Aether is one of the principle elements of life and magic in the world.
|-
|Arsonium
|[[I Expect You to Die]]
|A green liquid with the symbol Ar and the atomic number 7 that makes a compound that is corrosive to copper when mixed with Galine and Sanite, and a compound that produces clouds when exposed to air when mixed with Regalite.
|- 
|Atium
|''[[Mistborn series|Mistborn]]'' book series
|A metal that forms the body and power of the [[Cosmere|shard]] Ruin. If an Allomancer burns the metal, it allows the user to see a few seconds into the future as a ghostly image overlaid on the present. This allows the user to gain a significant advantage in combat, as it allow them to know every move their opponent will make. This is cancelled out if the opponent burns atium or [[electrum]] themselves, as it causes a feedback loop and causes the user to see a mess of possible futures. It is extremely valuable in the Final Empire, as it is both very rare and hoarded by the Lord Ruler. The only place it is found is in the pits of Hathsin, where small nuggets are formed in geodes mined by slaves. Using allomany near the crystals that form the geodes destroys them. When used by a Feruchemist, it allows them to store age and, if compounded, can result in a complete stop of ageing. Its name comes from the holder of the shard, Ati. in the [[Wax and Wayne]] era, no samples exist and it is referred to as 'the lost metal'. It forms the allow Malatium, also known as the eleventh metal, a metal that allows the user to see past versions of other people. A misting that burns atium is known as a seer. Hemalurgic effects are unknown.
|-
|Australium
|''[[Team Fortress 2]]''
|An extremely valuable element appearing in ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' by [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]. In-game, it appears as a special type of weapon, and as the fuel for the rocket in the map SD_Doomsday in the Special Delivery game mode. In the bonus comics featured on the Team Fortress website, their role is fleshed out more; The Life-Extending machines used by The Administrator, Blutarch, Redmond, and Gray Mann are powered by Australium, and a large part of the plot revolves around hiding the vast stores of Australium &lt;ref&gt;http://www.teamfortress.com/catchup/&lt;/ref&gt; Their role in the story is that the material, found in [[Australia]], hence the name Australium, makes one smarter over time, but at the cost of increasing 'manliness and beard levels' in those who use it. As mentioned above, the name comes from the country of Australia and the Neo-Latin '-ium' used to denote a metallic name.
|-
|{{anchor|bavarium}}Bavarium
|''[[Just Cause 3]]''
|Discovered by Medici's tyrannical ruler Sebastiano Di Ravello in the late 1980s, Bavarium is referred to as a "supermineral" in reference to its near-infinite potential. Exclusive to Medici, Bavarium is at the core of much of the country's experimental weaponry and equipment- which, as of the ''Bavarium Sea Heist'' DLC, includes gravitational manipulators and personal force fields -as well as a major export; Di Ravello is able to use it as a bargaining chip when dealing with the Agency. In-game, Bavarium- in its refined form, at least -is shown to be highly volatile and prone to large, violent explosions- a small Bavarium-based charge is capable of instantly destroying all but the largest of the game's Chaos Objects.
|-
|{{anchor|bolognium|bolonium}}Bolognium / Bolonium
|Various sources
|A metallic element with variable properties; a substitute for any unspecified substance or element; or in science fiction writing, a substance or process invented to circumvent explanation or impossibility.  A humorous story from 1926 about the development of alloys for special purposes, describes Bolognium as a metallic element with properties similar to ''Gafnium'', with which it forms alloys impervious to attacks by mice.&lt;ref&gt;''Transactions of the American Society for Steel Treating'', vol. 9 (1926), p. 663.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bolognium may also refer to any unspecified substance or element: "if not oil then beryllium, and if not beryllium then bolognium",&lt;ref&gt;"Up from the Magma and Back Again with Paul Hiebert", in ''Manitoba Arts Review'' (1948), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; "don't worry about whether it is mercury or lead or cadmium or 'bolognium'."&lt;ref&gt;''Mercury in the Marine Environment: Workshop Proceedings, 29 November to 1 December 1988, Sheraton Anchorage Hotel, Anchorage, Alaska'', United States Minerals Management Service (1989) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  Noted science fiction writer [[David Gerrold]] attributes the use of the term in science fiction writing to [[Larry Niven]], the author of ''[[Ringworld]]'', who used it to describe imaginary materials or processes capable of explaining properties unachievable through known or scientifically-postulated means.  In ''Worlds of Wonder'', Gerrold describes two examples from ''Ringworld'': "scrith", a substance strong enough to be used for the construction of a ring one hundred and eighty million miles in diameter, and a character deliberately bred for the property of luck.  Gerrold refers to bolognium as "technobabble", and cautions writers against overusing it, or using it carelessly, as doing so undermines the illusion of reality upon which good science fiction relies.&lt;ref&gt;David Gerrold, ''Worlds of Wonder: How to Write Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy'', Writer's Digest Books (2001), pp. 59, 72 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term itself has appeared in episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', in which ''Bolognium'', [[symbol (chemistry)|atomic symbol]] ''Bo'', appears in the place of [[Molybdenum]], [[atomic number]] 42, on promotional copies of the [[periodic table]] produced by [[Oscar Mayer]] (its [[atomic weight]] is "delicious" or "snacktacular"),&lt;ref&gt;''The Simpsons'', "Lisa Gets an 'A'" (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[Futurama]]'', where Cubert Farnsworth exclaims, "your explanations are pure weapons-grade bolognium!"&lt;ref&gt;''Futurama'', "A Clone of My Own" (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although most references to Bolognium are intentionally humorous, in ''Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars'', Greg Cox refers to the "bolognium shielding" of [[Klingon]] warp nacelles.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Cox, ''Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh'', volume two, Simon &amp; Schuster (2002), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

|Bombastium
|Disney&lt;ref&gt;Carl Barks, ''Walt Disney’s Uncle Scrooge: A Cold Bargain – Gladstone Comic Album'' #24, (Gladstone) {{ISBN|0-944599-24-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|Originally appearing in Uncle Scrooge #17 (1957) by Carl Barks, Bombastium is stated to be the rarest element in the world. Even though it is very coveted, its usage potential is not entirely known. One characteristic is that it tastes different every time one tries it, and scientists eventually discovered that one atom of bombastium dropped into a barrel of water becomes one barrel of ice cream: a different flavor of ice cream each time. To avoid evaporation, bombastium must be kept frozen.&lt;ref name="Andrae"/&gt; In the story, when this totally new element was discovered Scrooge tries to secure the entire supply – a ball of “Bombastium” approximately the size of a large turnip. Terrified that his acquisition will melt before he can make a profit, Scrooge drags Donald Duck and his nephews on a voyage to the South Pole to safeguard his investment, but he has not reckoned on the ruthless determination of the Brutopian agents he outbid to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsreview.co.uk/nowreadthis/2010/03/07/walt-disney%E2%80%99s-uncle-scrooge-a-cold-bargain-gladstone-comic-album-24/  www.comicsreview.co.uk - Walt Disney’s Uncle Scrooge: A Cold Bargain]&lt;/ref&gt; Bombastium represents a play on words (bomb and bombastic) that negotiates Cold War hysteria surrounding the arms race and the threat of Armageddon provoked by the development of the H-bomb.&lt;ref name="Andrae"&gt;Tom Andrae, ''Carl Barks and the Disney Comic Book: Unmasking the Myth of Modernity'', p216, (Univ. Press of Mississippi), 2006, {{ISBN|1578068584}}, 9781578068586&lt;/ref&gt; Barks's tale is also grounded in fears. The substance is later used in the ''[[Duck Tales]]'' series.
|-
|[[Administratium|Bureaucratium]]
|Scientific [[in-joke]]
|Similar to [[Administratium]] and variation of the joke. In this version of the joke, Bureaucratium is an element which has a negative [[half-life]], becoming more massive and sluggish as time goes by.
|-
|Buginium Z
|Pokemon Sun and Moon
|A Z-Crystal that allows Pokemon to use the Bug-type Z-Move, Savage Spin-Out.
|-
|Byzanium
|''[[Raise the Titanic!]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kclibrary.org/blog/film-blog/program-notes-raise-titanic-1980 | title=Program Notes: Raise the Titanic! (1980) | publisher=Kansas City Public Library | date=12 April 2012 | accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|Byzanium is a fictional element within the book ''Raise the Titanic!'' and its [[Raise the Titanic (film)|film adaptation]], which serves as a main focus of the story arc. It is a powerful radioactive material sought after by both the Americans and Russians for use as either an energy source for a missile defense system or an atomic superbomb. The largest known natural source of Byzanium was on the island of [[Novaya Zemlya]], which was mined in the early 20th century and supposedly taken aboard the ill-fated [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] during her first and only voyage.

|{{anchor|Balthorium}}{{anchor|Cobalt_Thorium_G/Cobalt}}Cobalt Thorium G&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenplays-online.de/screenplay/21 continuity screenplay]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/strangelove.txt shooting draft]&lt;/ref&gt;
|''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', ''[[Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot]]''
|In ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' it is an element used in the Russians' doomsday device. Both (real) elements [[Cobalt]] and [[Thorium]] can be used in [[atomic weapons]] to increase the amount of dangerous [[nuclear fallout]], which agrees with the sense in which "Cobalt Thorium G" is used in the movie.

In the "Wages of Fire" episode of ''[[Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot]]'', it is revealed that the BGY-11 is powered by a Cobalt Thorium G power core.
|-
|Carbonadium{{Anchor|Carbonadium}}
|[[Marvel Comics]]
|In the [[Marvel Comics]] universe, Carbonadium is a form of [[Adamantium]] that is developed the USSR and used by the villain [[Omega Red]], whose retractable metal tentacles are composed of the radioactive metal alloy. Carbonadium is nearly as strong as Adamantium, but more flexible. It is also used in the armor suit of [[Moon Knight]] in the third series of that comic.
|-
|-
|Cavorite{{Anchor|Cavorite}}
|''[[The First Men in the Moon]]''
|In the H.G. Wells novel, a metal created by the physicist Cavor which has the property of blocking gravity waves. This makes his space vehicle selectively immune to the pull of gravity, allowing it to choose which heavenly bodies it may or may not fall towards via the opening or sliding of outer hull Cavorite "windows or blinds". This steers, accelerates and decelerates the spacecraft, dependent on available gravitational forces, somewhat analogous to a "tacking" behavior of a sailed ship.
|-
|Celestial Bronze
|[[Greek Mythology]], [[Rick Riordan]] books (introduced in The Lightning Thief)
|A magical form of [[bronze]] mined from Mount Olympus, tempered in Mount Etna, and cooled in the River Lethe. Cannot come into physical contact with non-magical creatures. Lethal to monsters.
|-
|Chlorophyte
|[[Terraria]]
|A bright-green metal found deep beneath the jungle, implied to be the toughest ore that can be mined from the ground (only being topped by Luminite, a material dropped by the final boss). As the name suggests, Chlorophyte holds various plant-themed properties, and can be used to craft armor and weapons that harness the powers of plants. It can be combined with glowing mushrooms to create Shroomite, a blue fungi-themed version of the same metal used in ranged weapons and armor, or with ectoplasm to create Spectre Bars, a glowing ghost-themed metal used in various magical weapons and mage armor.
|-
|Chronoton{{Anchor|Chronoton}}
|Numerous works
|From Greek: Χρόνος ([[Chronos]], "time") +  -ον  (on, "elementary particle"). Alternate spellings: "chroniton." Associated with manipulating or traveling through time in ''[[Star Trek]],'' as well as in ''[[Futurama]],'' where it also has rejuvenation effects. A chronoton bomb in ''[[Teen Titans]]'' destroys chronotons in a given area, stopping that area's progression through time. A "chroniton rifle" is the most powerful weapon in ''[[Jets 'N' Guns]].'' The material has also been featured in ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]''.

|Collapsium
|The [[H. Beam Piper#Terro-Human Future History|Terro-Human Future History]], ''[[The Collapsium]]''
|Collapsium was first mentioned by [[H. Beam Piper]] in his Terro-Human Future History series. Piper describes it as "the electron shells of the atoms collapsed upon the nuclei, the atoms in actual contact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8-QMjzlT5wC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=the+electron+shells+of+the+atoms+collapsed+upon+the+nuclei,+the+atoms+in+actual+contact&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l4Nn_dYV4n&amp;sig=oU6efpkokrEQjeKuxAtnHrcpcEw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cp5tVMPOKZDBiQKu14GIBg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20electron%20shells%20of%20the%20atoms%20collapsed%20upon%20the%20nuclei%2C%20the%20atoms%20in%20actual%20contact&amp;f=false|title=''Junkyard Planet''|last=Piper|first=H. Beam|date=2007|publisher=Wildside Press|accessdate=2014-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Collapsium can only be worked by abrasion with cosmic rays. It is resistant to both ordinary matter projectiles and all forms of radiation, and can be plated on to ordinary steel to form a protective layer. The main use for collapsium is as armor for spacecraft.

A different version of collapsium appeared in [[Wil McCarthy]]'s novel ''The Collapsium''.  McCarthy's collapsium is composed of black holes and can be used to warp space and time in accordance with the wishes of its inventor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-345-40856-3|title=Fiction Book Review: The Collapsium by Wil McCarthy|date=2014|publisher=''[[Publishers Weekly]]''|accessdate=2014-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Corrodium
|''[[Ben 10]]''
|A high energy and very unpredictable mineral collected by Thep Khufans naturally not found on Earth and can mutate any living thing when exposed.
|-
|[[Dalek#Physical characteristics|Dalekanium]]
|''[[Doctor Who]]'' (introduced in ''[[The Dalek Invasion of Earth]]'')
|A fictitious bonded [[Carbide|polycarbide]] material from the [[Dalek]]s' homeworld of [[Skaro]] that is, among other things, a powerful but unstable explosive that will even affect the Daleks' body casings (and, ironically, is also the material used in the makeup of said body casings).

|[[Dilithium (Star Trek)|Dilithium]]
|''[[Star Trek]]''
|Although [[dilithium]] (Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) does exist as a molecule composed of two covalently bonded [[lithium]] atoms, a different substance is referred to in fiction. In the Star Trek fictional universe, dilithium is a material occurring in crystalline form which serves as a controlling agent in the matter-antimatter reaction cores used to power the faster-than-light warp drive propulsion. In the original series, dilithium crystals were rare and could not be replicated, making the search for them a recurring plot element. It has been noted that when the crystals appeared in the original series they looked much like [[petalite]],&lt;ref name="LithiumBook"&gt;Paula Johanson, ''Lithium - Understanding the elements of the periodic table'', p24, (The Rosen Publishing Group), 2007, {{ISBN|1404209409}}, 9781404209404&lt;/ref&gt; an important ore of lithium. The use of the name dilithium has led to speculation as to whether it is meant to be an isotope of lithium or a compound with two lithium atoms.&lt;ref name="LithiumBook"/&gt; However, according to a periodic table shown during a Next Generation episode, it is shown as an element with the chemical symbol Dt and the atomic number 87, which in reality belongs to [[francium]].

|Divinium (E115)
|[[Call of Duty|''Call of Duty'' series]]
|An extraterrestrial element found in meteorites. The German research team Group 935 discovered it in northern [[France]] in 1918 where zombified Christian knights infected the research team. Seen throughout the 'Zombies' storyline, it powers energy weapons, zombifies (and in some cases mutates) humans, increases the abilities of humans, can bend time and space, and alters firearms. E115 is used in some way, form, or fashion by the [[German Empire]], [[Nazi Germany]], and the [[Soviet Union]], creating zombies every time. In real life, element 115 is [[moscovium]] and is highly unstable, lasting only seconds before [[radioactive decay|decaying radioactively]].

|Dust
|''[[RWBY]]''
|In the anime series ''RWBY'', Dust is a naturally occurring, crystalline energy source found in the world of Remnant that can be activated by the Aura of Humans and Faunus. This material comes in a variety of types, each with different properties such as fire, ice, wind, gravity, etc. While there are four main kinds, these can be blended naturally or artificially to create new kinds. While crystalline dust is stable enough to remain out in the open, powdered Dust is highly volatile, and must be stored in special containers for safety. Dust has a variety of uses, including acting as a power source for machinery such as airships and robots. Dust may also be used for combat in the form of dust-filled bullets, as powder placed inside weapons and clothing, or in its crystalline form for raw power. Dust will stop functioning if it is taken outside of the atmosphere of Remnant, meaning it may not be used for space travel. In the series, most of Remnant's supply of this material comes from the Schnee Dust Company, which mines, purifies, and exports the material throughout the world.

|A rare, [[superheavy element|superheavy]] metal first depicted (but not named) as a [[quartzite]]-like "[[mineral]]" in the original [[Stargate (film)|''Stargate'' movie]]. Its most basic use is as a weapon: naquadah greatly amplifies energy, making it extremely potent if paired with explosives. Due to its unique properties, naquadah forms the basis for many advanced technologies; the Stargates themselves are composed almost entirely of naquadah. Naquadah is also present in the bloodstream of the [[Goa'uld]], which allows them to control their technology and sense the presence of other symbiotes.

Among the unusual properties of Nth metal is the ability to negate [[gravity]], allowing a person wearing an object made of Nth metal, such as a [[belt (clothing)|belt]], to [[flight|fly]]. In addition, Nth metal also protects the wearer from the elements and speeds the healing of wounds,&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkman'' (vol. 4) #21&lt;/ref&gt; increases their strength, and protects them from extremes in temperature. It has many other properties that have yet to be revealed in full.  It has been implied that the apparently "magical" abilities of the Thanagarian [[supervillain]], [[Onimar Synn]], all stem from his unique mastery of the properties of Nth metal.  These powers are augmented to a god-like level during the [[Rann-Thanagar War]] when he builds himself an artificial body made of the substance.

In ancient [[Egypt]] a Thanagarian [[starship|spaceship]] made of Nth metal crash-landed, only to be discovered by Prince Khufu and his betrothed, Chay-ara. Constant exposure to Nth metal forced Khufu and Chay-ara into a cycle of [[reincarnation]]. In the 20th century, they were incarnated as [[Carter Hall (comics)|Carter Hall]] and Shiera Saunders, the original Hawkman and [[Hawkgirl]]. As Hawkman and Hawkgirl, they wore Nth metal belts, made with the help of the Thanagarian [[Paran Katar]], father of Katar Hol, when he was visiting Earth.

Many years later, Carter and Shiera's son, [[Doctor Fate|Hector Hall]], made a suit of [[armor]] of Nth metal and took the name [[Silver Scarab]] as a founding member of [[Infinity Inc.]] The suit provided him with protection from attacks, let him lift great weights, and allowed him to fly and project solar energy blasts.

The current Hawkman and [[Hawkgirl]] continue to wear Nth metal.

Much later in the DC timeline, members of the [[Legion of Super Heroes]] wear "flight rings" made of an alloy of Nth metal called valorium.

The mercenary [[Deathstroke]] wears armor composed of Nth metal.

|&lt;sup&gt;61&lt;/sup&gt;Pm
|[[Promethium]]
|''[[DC Comics]]''
|An artificial element from the [[DC Universe]], created by Dayton Industries. Promethium was named after the eponymous titan of Greek myth [[Prometheus]], for his deed of giving mankind fire and knowledge erstwhile being chained to a rock with eagles picking at his innards for all eternity after. The company owner and its creator [[Mento (comics)|Steve Dayton]], theorized the potential applications for Promethium, both for good and ill, were limitless.&lt;ref&gt;''New Teen Titans'' Vol. 1 #9&lt;/ref&gt;

Promethium is a metal alloy that comes in two quite different isotopes, "depleted" and "volatile" promethium. Promethium's properties make it highly coveted by various public and clandestine interests. Key among which is that it's virtually indestructible with self restorative properties. The mercenary [[Deathstroke]], for example, uses a suit of the volatile variety which could mend itself after being damaged.&lt;ref&gt;''New Teen Titans'' Vol. 1 #10&lt;/ref&gt; Both young heroes [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor Stone]]'s bionic chassis and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]]'s body armor were made of the depleted variety.

Dayton believed Promethium alloys could make most anything coated in them impervious to destruction or abrasion. Even theorizing that it could impart its matter regenerative abilities to organic anatomy down the line of its testing.

'''Depleted promethium'''
The most common isotope of promethium was the inert element that was easier to sell and managed on a grander scale. By itself it was extremely durable, [[Firestorm (comics)|Ronnie Raymond]] once commented even Superman couldn't break it even with his strength.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA'' #73 (Dec. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; When Depleted Promethium is alloyed with other dense metals such as Kevlar or molybdenum-steel, it forms a near-invulnerable metal polymer.

The supervillain [[Prometheus (DC Comics)#Curt Calhoun|Prometheus]] gained his powers after getting dunked in a solution of titanium/vanadium alloy infused with promethium while working at Kord Industries as a foremen in its smelting plant. Retaining a metallic epidermal layer with the ability to heat up his body several degrees Celsius able to burn at a touch.&lt;ref&gt;''Blue Beetle'' Vol. 6 #3 (Aug. 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Volatile promethium'''
The rarest manifest of Promethium is its radioactive isotope, capable of absorbing and generating its own energy in near limitless quantities. Useful as a self-sustaining power source for many gadgets and facilities when properly utilized. The only drawback being that "volatile promethium" has dangerous mutagenic properties which can either be used to mutate living beings into hideous monstrosities or trigger the latent metagene resting within the DNA of others.

The latter is proven true when due to Deathstroke the Terminator's use of promethium forged weaponry and equipment; e.i. his armor, sword and possibly his gun staff made from volatile promethium. Which he can use these without worry due to his healing factor, had triggered latent superpower capabilities within his children [[Rose Wilson|Rose]] and [[Jericho (comics)|Joseph Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;''Deathstroke'' Vol. 4 #10 (Mar. 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Its use and proliferation also had a hand in creating the super-villain team known as [[Hybrid (DC Comics)|The Hybrid]], as each of them gained their powers from infusions of the irradiated material.&lt;ref&gt;''New Teen Titans'' Vol. 2 #24 (Oct. 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tale==
[[File:Little Red Riding Hood - Project Gutenberg etext 19993.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Little Red Riding Hood'', illustrated in a 1927 story anthology]]

The story revolves around a girl called Little Red Riding Hood. In [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Grimms']] and [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]'s versions of the tale, she is named after her magical red [[hood (headgear)|hood]]ed [[cape]]/[[cloak]] that she wears. The girl walks through the woods to deliver food to her sickly grandmother (wine and cake depending on the translation). In the Grimms' version, her mother had ordered her to stay strictly on the path.

A Big Bad Wolf wants to eat the girl and the food in the basket. He secretly stalks her behind trees, bushes, shrubs, and patches of little and tall grass. He approaches Little Red Riding Hood, who naively tells him where she is going. He suggests the girl to pick some flowers, which she does. In the meantime, he goes to the grandmother's house and gains entry by pretending to be the girl. He swallows the grandmother wholly (in some stories, he locks her in the closet) and waits for the girl, disguised as the grandma.

[[File:GustaveDore She was astonished to see how her grandmother looked.jpg|thumb|[[Gustave Doré]]'s engraving of the scene: "She was astonished to see how her grandmother looked"]]

When the girl arrives, she notices that her grandmother looks very strange. Little Red then says, "What a deep voice you have!" ("The better to greet you with", responds the wolf), "Goodness, what big eyes you have!" ("The better to see you with", responds the wolf), "And what big hands you have!" ("The better to hug/grab you with", responds the wolf), and lastly, "What a big mouth you have" ("The better to eat you with!", responds the wolf), at which point the wolf jumps out of bed and eats her up too. Then he falls asleep. In Charles Perrault's version of the story (the first version to be published), the tale ends here. However, in later versions, the story continues generally as follows:

A [[lumberjack|woodcutter]] in the French version, but a [[Hunting|hunter]] in the Brothers Grimm and traditional German versions, comes to the rescue and with an axe, and cuts open the sleeping wolf. Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother emerge unharmed. Then they fill the wolf's body with heavy stones. The wolf awakens and attempts to flee, but the stones cause him to collapse and die. Sanitized versions of the story have the grandmother locked in the closet instead of being eaten and some have Little Red Riding Hood saved by the lumberjack as the wolf advances on her rather than after she gets eaten, where the woodcutter kills the wolf with his axe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spurgeon|first=Maureen|title=Red Riding Hood|year=1990|publisher=Brown Watson|location=England|isbn=0709706928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale makes the clearest contrast between the safe world of the village and the dangers of the [[enchanted forest|forest]], conventional [[Antithesis|antitheses]] that are essentially medieval, though no written versions are as old as that.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} It also warns about the dangers of not obeying one's mother (at least in the Grimms' version).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Tale's history==
===Relationship to other tales===

The story displays many similarities to stories from classical Greece and Rome. Scholar Graham Anderson has compared the story to a local legend recounted by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in which, each year, a virgin girl was offered to a malevolent spirit dressed in the skin of a wolf, who raped the girl. Then, one year, the boxer Euthymos came along, slew the spirit, and married the girl who had been offered up as a sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|page= 94|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of different stories recounted by Greek authors involving a woman named Pyrrha (literally "Fire") and a man with some name meaning "wolf".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|pages =94–95|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman poet [[Horace]] alludes to a tale in which a male child is rescued alive from the belly of [[Lamia]], a female [[ogre]]ss in classical mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|pages =96–97|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialogue between the Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood has its analogies to the Norse ''[[Þrymskviða]]'' from the ''[[Elder Edda]]''; the giant [[Þrymr]] had stolen [[Mjölner]], [[Thor]]'s hammer, and demanded [[Freyja]] as his bride for its return. Instead, the gods dressed Thor as a bride and sent him. When the giants note Thor's unladylike eyes, eating, and drinking, [[Loki]] explains them as Freyja's not having slept, or eaten, or drunk, out of longing for the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=[[Iona and Peter Opie|Opie, Iona &amp; Peter]]|title=The Classic Fairy Tales|pages= 93–4|isbn= 0-19-211559-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel to another Norse myth, the chase and eventual murder of the [[Sól (sun)|sun goddess]] by the wolf [[Sköll]], has also been drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Dundes, Alan &amp; McGlathery, James M. (ed.). "Intrepreting Little Red Riding Hood Psychoanalytically". The Brothers Grimm and Folktale. pp. 26–7. {{ISBN|0-252-01549-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A very similar story also belongs to the North African tradition, namely in [[Kabylia]], where a number of versions are attested.&lt;ref&gt;The oldest source is the tale ''Rova'' in: [[Leo Frobenius]], ''Volksmärchen und Volksdichtungen Afrikas'' / Band III, Jena 1921: 126-129, fairy tale # 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of the little girl who visits her (grand-)dad in his cabin and is recognized by the sound of her bracelets constitutes the refrain of a well-known song by the modern singer [[Idir]], ''[[A Vava Inouva]]'':
{|

:
:‘I beseech you, open the door for me, father.
:Jingle your bracelets, oh my daughter Ghriba.
:I’m afraid of the monster in the forest, father.

The theme of the ravening wolf and of the creature released unharmed from its [[stomach|belly]] is also reflected in the Russian tale ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]''{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} and another Grimm tale ''[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids]]'',{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} but its general theme of restoration is at least as old as the biblical story, ''[[Book of Jonah|Jonah and the Whale]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The theme also appears in the story of the life of [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret]], wherein the saint emerges unharmed from the belly of a [[dragon]],{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} and in the epic "The Red Path" by [[Jim C. Hines]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

A Taiwanese story from the 16th Century, known as Grandaunt Tiger bears several striking similarities. When the girl's mother goes out, the tiger comes to the girl's house and pretends to be their aunt, asking to come in. The girl says that her voice does not sound right, so the tiger attempts to disguise her voice. Then, the girl says that her hands feel too coarse, so the tiger attempts to make them smoother. When finally, the tiger gains entry, she eats the girl's sister's hand. The girl comes up with a ruse to go outside and fetch some food for her aunt. Grandaunt Tiger, suspicious of the girl, ties a rope to her leg. The girl ties a bucket to the rope to fool her, but Grandaunt Tiger realises this and chases after her, whereupon she climbs into a tree. The girl tells the tiger that she will let her eat her, but first she would like to feed her some fruit from the tree. The tiger comes closer to eat the food, whereupon, the girl pours boiling hot oil down her throat, killing her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lontzen |first1=Dr Guntzen |title=The Earliest Version of the Chinese Red Riding Hood |jstor=41390379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earliest versions===
[[File:Walter Crane26.jpg|thumb|upright|"The better to see you with": woodcut by [[Walter Crane]]]]

The origins of the Little Red Riding Hood story can be traced to versions from various European countries and more than likely preceding the 17th century, of which several exist, some significantly different from the currently known, Grimms-inspired version. It was told by [[France|French]] peasants in the 10th century&lt;ref name="Jacques Berlioz 2007 p63"/&gt; and recorded by the cathedral schoolmaster Egbert of Liege.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Ziolkowski, "A fairy tale from before fairy tales: Egbert of Liege's ‘De puella a lupellis seruata’ and the medieval background of ‘Little Red Riding Hood’", ''Speculum'' 67 (1992): 549–575.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Italy]], the Little Red Riding Hood was told by peasants in the fourteenth century, where a number of versions exist, including ''La finta nonna'' (The False Grandmother), written among others by [[Italo Calvino]] in the ''[[Italian Folktales]]'' collection.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, In Hungarian folklore, the story is known as "Piroska" (Little Red), is still told in mostly the original version described above. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 744, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been called "The Story of Grandmother". It is also possible that this early tale has roots in very similar East Asian tales (e.g. "Grandaunt Tiger").&lt;ref&gt;Alan Dundes, ''little ducking''&lt;/ref&gt;

These early variations of the tale, do differ from the currently known version in several ways. The antagonist is not always a wolf, but sometimes an [[ogre]], [[vampire]],&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D. Haase, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairytales: G-P (pp. 466-492). Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; or a 'bzou' ([[werewolf]]), making these tales relevant to the werewolf-trials (similar to witch trials) of the time (e.g. the trial of [[Peter Stumpp]]).&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Orenstein, ''Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale'', pp 92-106, {{ISBN|0-465-04126-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wolf usually leaves the grandmother's blood and meat for the girl to eat, who then unwittingly [[cannibal]]izes her own grandmother. Furthermore, the wolf was also known to ask her to remove her clothing and toss it into the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zipes|first=Jack|title=The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood|year=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-90835-3|edition=2nd|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some versions, the wolf eats the girl after she gets into bed with him, and the story ends there.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Darnton|first=Robert|title=The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History|year=1985|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0-394-72927-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In others, she sees through his disguise and tries to escape, complaining to her "grandmother" that she needs to defecate and would not wish to do so in the bed. The wolf reluctantly lets her go, tied to a piece of string so she does not get away. However, the girl slips the string over something else and runs off. In these stories she escapes with no help from any male or older female figure, instead using her own cunning, or in some versions the help of a younger boy who she happens to run into.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D. Haase, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairytales: G-P (pp. 522-534). Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, though more rarely, the red hood is even non-existent.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In other tellings of the story, the wolf chases after Little Red Riding Hood. She escapes with the help of some laundresses, who spread a sheet taut over a river so she may escape. When the wolf follows Red over the bridge of cloth, the sheet is released and the wolf drowns in the river.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D. Haase, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairytales: G-P (pp. 583-588). Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; And in another version the wolf is pushed into the fire, while he is preparing the meat of the grandmother to be eaten by the girl.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Charles Perrault===
The earliest known printed version&lt;ref&gt;Iona and Peter Opie, ''The Classic Fairy Tales''. p. 93. {{ISBN|0-19-211559-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; was known as ''Le Petit [[Chaperon (headgear)|Chaperon]] Rouge'' and may have had its origins in 17th-century French [[folklore]]. It was included in the collection ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps passé|Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals. Tales of Mother Goose]]'' (''Histoires et contes du temps passé, avec des moralités. Contes de ma mère l'Oye''), in 1697, by [[Charles Perrault]]. As the title implies, this version&lt;ref&gt;Charles Perrault, "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0333.html Le Petit Chaperon Rouge]"&lt;/ref&gt; is both more sinister and more overtly moralized than the later ones. The redness of the hood, which has been given symbolic significance in many interpretations of the tale, was a detail introduced by Perrault.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, p 17, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Little Red Riding Hood.jpg|thumb|left|French images,like this 19th-century painting, show the much shorter red [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] being worn]]

The story had as its subject an "attractive, well-bred young lady", a village girl of the country being deceived into giving a wolf she encountered the information he needed to find her grandmother's house successfully and eat the old woman while at the same time avoiding being noticed by woodcutters working in the nearby forest. Then he proceeded to lay a trap for the Red Riding Hood. Little Red Riding Hood ends up being asked to climb into the bed before being eaten by the wolf, where the story ends. The wolf emerges the victor of the encounter and there is no happy ending.

Charles Perrault explained the 'moral' at the end of the tale:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/perrault02.html |title=Little Red Riding Hood Charles Perrault |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=21 September 2003 |website=Pitt.Edu |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |access-date=12 January 2016|quote=And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that no doubt is left to his intended meaning:

{{quote|From this story one learns that children, especially young lasses, pretty, courteous and well-bred, do very wrong to listen to strangers, And it is not an unheard thing if the Wolf is thereby provided with his dinner. I say Wolf, for all wolves are not of the same sort; there is [[Rake (character)|one kind]] with an amenable disposition – neither noisy, nor hateful, nor angry, but tame, obliging and gentle, following the young maids in the streets, even into their homes. Alas! Who does not know that these gentle wolves are of all such creatures the most dangerous!}}

This, the presumed original, version of the tale was written for late seventeenth-century French court of [[King Louis XIV]]. This audience, whom the King entertained with extravagant parties, presumably would take from the story the intended meaning.

===The Brothers Grimm===
[[File:Grimm.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm (left) and Jacob Grimm, from an 1855 painting by [[Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann]]]]

In the 19th century two separate German versions were retold to [[Jacob Grimm]] and his younger brother [[Wilhelm Grimm]], known as the [[Brothers Grimm]], the first by Jeanette Hassenpflug (1791–1860) and the second by Marie Hassenpflug (1788–1856). The brothers turned the first version to the main body of the story and the second into a sequel of it. The story as ''Rotkäppchen'' was included in the first edition of their collection ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Kinder- und Hausmärchen]]'' (Children's and Household Tales (1812)).&lt;ref&gt;Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0333.html#grimm Little Red Cap]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier parts of the tale agree so closely with Perrault's variant that it is almost certainly the source of the tale.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Velten, "The Influences of Charles Perrault's ''Contes de ma Mère L'oie'' on German Folklore", p 966, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they modified the ending; this version had the little girl and her grandmother saved by a huntsman who was after the wolf's skin; this ending is identical to that in the tale "[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids]]", which appears to be the source.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Velten, "The Influences of Charles Perrault's ''Contes de ma Mère L'oie'' on German Folklore", p 967, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second part featured the girl and her grandmother trapping and killing another wolf, this time anticipating his moves based on their experience with the previous one. The girl did not leave the path when the wolf spoke to her, her grandmother locked the door to keep it out, and when the wolf lurked, the grandmother had Little Red Riding Hood put a trough under the chimney and fill it with water that sausages had been cooked in; the smell lured the wolf down, and it drowned.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 149 W. W. Norton &amp; company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brothers further revised the story in later editions and it reached the above-mentioned final and better-known version in the 1857 edition of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm026.html Little Red Cap]"&lt;/ref&gt; It is notably tamer than the older stories which contained darker themes.

===After the Grimms===
[[File:Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf (1858).jpg|thumb|left| An engraving from the ''Cyclopedia of Wit and Humor''.]]

Numerous authors have rewritten or adapted this tale.

[[Andrew Lang]] included a variant called "The True History of Little Goldenhood"&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/ridinghood/stories/golden.html The True History of Little Goldenhood]", ''The Red Fairy Book'' (1890)&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[The Red Fairy Book]]'' (1890). He derived it from the works of Charles Marelles,&lt;ref&gt;The proper name of this French author is ''Charles Marelle'' (1827-19..), there is a typo in Andrew Lang's ''Red Fairy Book''. See [http://data.bnf.fr/12364021/charles_marelle/ BNF note online].&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Contes of Charles Marelles''. This version explicitly states that the story had been mistold earlier. The girl is saved, but not by the huntsman; when the wolf tries to eat her, its mouth is burned by the golden hood she wears, which is enchanted.

[[James Nelson Barker|James N. Barker]] wrote a variation of Little Red Riding Hood in 1827 as an approximately 1000-word story. It was later reprinted in 1858 in a book of collected stories edited by William E Burton, called the ''Cyclopedia of Wit and Humor''. The reprint also features a wood engraving of a clothed wolf on bended knee holding Little Red Riding Hood's hand.

In the 20th century, the popularity of the tale appeared to snowball, with many new versions being written and produced, especially in the wake of Freudian analysis, [[deconstruction]] and [[feminist literary criticism|feminist critical theory]]. (See [[#Modern uses and adaptations|"Modern uses and adaptations" below]].) This trend has also led to a number of academic texts being written that focus on Little Red Riding Hood, including works by [[Alan Dundes]] and [[Jack Zipes]].

==Interpretations==
[[File:Dore ridinghood.jpg|thumb|upright|A depiction by [[Gustave Doré]], 1883.]]

Besides the overt warning about talking to strangers, there are many interpretations of the classic fairy tale, many of them sexual.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Yolen, ''Touch Magic'' p 25, {{ISBN|0-87483-591-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some are listed below.

===Natural cycles===
[[folkloristics|Folklorists]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]], such as [[P. Saintyves]] and [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], saw "Little Red Riding Hood" in terms of solar myths and other naturally occurring cycles. Her red hood could represent the bright sun which is ultimately swallowed by the terrible night (the wolf), and the variations in which she is cut out of the wolf's belly represent the dawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tatar, Maria |page= 25|title=The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales|isbn= 0-393-05163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this interpretation, there is a connection between the wolf of this tale and [[Sköll]], the wolf in Norse mythology that will swallow [[Sól (sun)|the personified Sun]] at [[Ragnarök]], or [[Fenrir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dundes, Alan &amp; McGlathery, James M. (ed.) |title=Intrepreting Little Red Riding Hood Psychoanalytically|pages= 26–7|work=The Brothers Grimm and Folktale|isbn=0-252-01549-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the tale could be about the season of spring or the month of May, escaping the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dundes, Alan &amp; McGlathery, James M. (ed.) |title=Intrepreting Little Red Riding Hood Psychoanalytically|pages= 27|work=The Brothers Grimm and Folktale|isbn=0-252-01549-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Frederic Watts - Red Riding Hood - Project Gutenberg eText 17395.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Red Riding Hood'' by [[George Frederic Watts]]]]

===Rite===
The tale has been interpreted as a [[puberty]] rite, stemming from a prehistoric origin (sometimes an origin stemming from a previous matriarchal era).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dundes, Alan &amp; McGlathery, James M. (ed.) |title=Intrepreting Little Red Riding Hood Psychoanalytically|pages= 27–9|work=The Brothers Grimm and Folktale|isbn=0-252-01549-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girl, leaving home, enters a [[Liminality|liminal]] state and by going through the acts of the tale, is transformed into an adult woman by the act of coming out of the wolf's stomach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dundes, Alan &amp; McGlathery, James M. (ed.) |title=Intrepreting Little Red Riding Hood Psychoanalytically|pages= 27–8|work=The Brothers Grimm and Folktale|isbn=0-252-01549-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebirth===
[[Bruno Bettelheim]], in ''[[The Uses of Enchantment]]: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales'' (1976), recast the Little Red Riding Hood motif in terms of classic [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] analysis, that shows how fairy tales educate, support, and liberate children's emotions. The motif of the huntsman cutting open the wolf he interpreted as a "rebirth"; the girl who foolishly listened to the wolf has been reborn as a new person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tatar, Maria |title=The Annotated Brothers Grimm|page= 148 |isbn= 0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norse myth===
The poem "[[Þrymskviða]]" from the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' mirrors some elements of Red Riding Hood. [[Loki]]'s explanations for the strange behavior of "[[Freyja]]" (actually [[Thor]] disguised as Freyja) mirror the wolf's explanations for his strange appearance. The red hood has often been given great importance in many interpretations, with a significance from the dawn to blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dundes, Alan &amp; McGlathery, James M. (ed.)|title=Intrepreting Little Red Riding Hood Psychoanalytically|page= 32|work=The Brothers Grimm and Folktale|isbn= 0-252-01549-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erotic, romantic, or rape connotations===
A sexual analysis of the tale may also include negative connotations in terms of rape or abduction. In ''Against Our Will'', [[Susan Brownmiller]] describes the fairy tale as a description of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Orenstein, Catherine |title=Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality, and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale|pages= 145|isbn= 0-465-04125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many revisionist retellings choose to focus on empowerment, and depict Little Red Riding Hood or the grandmother successfully defending herself against the wolf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Orenstein, Catherine |title=Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality, and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale|pages= 160–161|isbn= 0-465-04125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such tellings bear some similarity to the "animal bridegroom" tales, such as ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' or ''[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]'', but where the heroines of those tales transform the hero into a prince, these tellings of ''Little Red Riding Hood'' reveal to the heroine that she has a wild nature like the hero's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Orenstein, Catherine |title=Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality, and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale|pages= 172–173|isbn= 0-465-04125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These interpretations refuse to characterize Little Red Riding Hood as a victim; these are tales of female empowerment.

'''''Man of Sorrows''''' is a small  [[Early Netherlandish]] oil on wood panel painting completed c. 1485-1495. It is attributed to [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]] and in the tradition of the devotional images of the "[[Man of Sorrows]]", which typically show Christ before his crucifixion, naked above the waist, bearing the wounds of his [[passion of Jesus|Passion]]. The panel has an unusually complex and suffocating spatial design, and depicts the [[mocking of Jesus]], and his [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|grieving mother]].&lt;ref&gt;Devonshire; Rosen, 348&lt;/ref&gt; The panel is steeped in both complex iconography and deep pathos. Christ is in obvious pain and holds his wounds up for the viewer. He looks out while  white robed weeping angels bear the [[Arma Christi]] -objects associated with his crucifixion and death- float around him. The attending saints include Mary and the [[Mary Magdalene|Magdalene]].

''Man of Sorrows'' has been described as "one of the most moving...in Early Netherlandish art", and is usually considered a highly emotive and sorrowful work, especially in its description of Christ's  pitiful, almost defeated expression and blood-run face.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al (2005), 148&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known about the lost right hand panel; it may have contained another religious scene or a [[donor portrait]].&lt;ref name="R150" /&gt; It is housed in the [[Museum Catharijneconvent]], [[Utrecht]].

==Devotional type==
[[File:Israhel van Meckenem the Younger - Man in sorrow - WGA14734.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Israhel van Meckenem the Younger]], ''Vera icon'', engraving, c. 1490. [[Staatliche Museen, Berlin]]]]
The panel is in the tradition of the iconic devotional image of the "[[Man of Sorrows]]", which developed in Europe from the 13th century, and was especially popular in Northern Europe. The phrase, in the passages of [[Isaiah 53]] (''[[Servant songs]]'') in the [[Hebrew Bible]], translates into English as "Man of Sorrows" ("vir dolorum" in the [[Vulgate]]):
&lt;small&gt;

3) He is despised and rejected of men, a Man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. And we hid as it were our faces from Him; He was despised, and we esteemed Him not.  

4) Surely He hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. 

5) But He was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed.

6) All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=29&amp;chapter=53&amp;version=48 |title=21st Century King James Version |work=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

In such works the viewer is asked to stand before the wounded and maimed, half naked body of Christ, and contemplate and contemplate and take responsibility for his sufferings.&lt;ref name="d69"&gt;Decker (2008), 69&lt;/ref&gt; Geertgen's depiction differs from previous iconographical depictions in that Christ's head is raised, and he looks directly at the viewer.&lt;ref name="d63"&gt;Decker (2008), 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Geertgen Man van smarten (detail).jpg|thumb|300px|Detail with angel overcome by grief]]
Christ stands in his tomb, a stone [[sarcophagus]].&lt;ref name="R150"/&gt; His entire body is lacerated and deformed by wounds sustained during his [[Flagellation of Christ|flogging]].&lt;ref name="d61"&gt;Decker (2008), 61&lt;/ref&gt; Yet he not clearly dead, as in earlier depictions. His eyes stare directly at the viewer, a device identified by the art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] as referring to the biblical text "Behold what I have suffered for you; what have you suffered for me".&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky (1953), 124&lt;/ref&gt; The gesture was earlier identified by art historian [[Alois Riegl]] as evoking an "external unity" where Christ's gaze becomes one with the viewer's world.&lt;ref name="R153"&gt;Ridderbos et al (2005), 153&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Wouter Slob writes that Christ's expression "confronts the contemporary viewer with the consequences of ''His'' sinning; the blood, splashing from the panel, flows because of his guilt."&lt;ref&gt;Slob, 40&lt;/ref&gt; 
Despite Christ's apparent agony, his animated, half-standing, half-kneeling pose in his sarcophagus seems to reference his [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]]. He may be equally descending into or our the tomb.&lt;ref name="d61" /&gt;

To his left, [[Mary Magdalene]] kneels in prayer. Her arms rest on the sarcophagus, her eyes are downcast, her plaintive expression is a study of grief. At the foot of the cross, Jesus' [[Mary, mother of Jesus|mother, Mary]], laments with arms folded, as large drops of tears pour down her face.&lt;ref name="S29" /&gt; She is supported by [[John the Evangelist]] with only his head and hands visible, wiping his tears with the back of his hand.&lt;ref name="R150"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A motif borrowed from [[Robert Campin]]'s ''[[Seilern Triptych|Entombment]]''. See Barasch, 25&lt;/ref&gt; Angels dressed in white robes, their eyes swollen with tears, carry the remaining [[Arma Christi]], including the lance, [[Holy Sponge]] and the [[Nail (relic)|three nails from the cross]].&lt;ref name="b22"&gt;Bara, 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
===Mourners===
[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans - Man of Sorrows - WGA08517 Detail.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Detail of [[Mary Magdalene]]]]
A number of saints and angels are openly weeping, imbuing the Passion with very human qualities, and expressive of emotional turmoil.&lt;ref name="b26"&gt;Barasch, 26&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the employment of tears is reflective of Geertgen's tendency towards emotionalism, but may also have been to intended to invoke [[contrition]], forcing the viewer to view Christ's sufferings individual terms, and reflect on their own [[original sin|culpability]]. Church theology of the time encouraged compassion for Christ's suffering, while emphasising that mankind was the source of his torments. According to art historian John Decker, medieval "sermons and devotional tracts encouraged the faithful to study the broken body of Christ, to tally his wounds, and to bear always in mind that humankind's various sins caused each injury."&lt;ref name="d68"&gt;Decker (2008), 68&lt;/ref&gt;  The scene allowed viewers "opportunities to interact empathetically with sacred history"; and encouraged [[contrition]] and [[penitence]],&lt;ref name="d65"&gt;Decker (2008), 65&lt;/ref&gt; an approach reflected in works by [[Rogier van der Weyden]], later adopted by Geertgen.&lt;ref name="d59-63"&gt;Decker (2008), 59-63&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans - Man of Sorrows - WGA08517 Detail2.jpg|400px|thumb|Detail showing [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], with a tear on her cheek]]
The use of tears to denote grief was probably derived from Rogier, who fascinated by tears, refined a subtle formula for the depiction of crying,&lt;ref name="b22" /&gt; as can be seen especially his Madrid ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'' of c. 1435.&lt;ref name="b27"&gt;Barasch, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Mary has a large tear pouring down her cheek, which art historian Moshe Barasch describes as "painted with subtle shadows to give it material substance, with reflections and a highlight to make it transparent and shiny", and compares its rendering to that of jewelry or glass.&lt;ref name="b26" /&gt;

In some instances the tears are implied by a hand gesture rather than actually shown. This is again influenced by Rogier's ''Descent'', but originates from Campin's ''Entombment'', where a figure is implied to be crying by the fact that he wipes his face with the back of his hand, a technique Rogier borrowed and perfected some 20 years later.&lt;ref name="b23"&gt;Barasch, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crucifixion===
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Deposition (detail) - WGA25578.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Detail from [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'',  c. 1435. Here van der Weyden portrays the tears and partially visible eyes of [[Mary of Clopas]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 34&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The panel shows Christs tortured body at his resting place on [[Calvary]], still carrying the torment of his [[True Cross|wooden cross]], his knees buckling from its weight.&lt;ref name="R152"&gt;Ridderbos et al (2005), 152&lt;/ref&gt; The painting contains many symbols of his Passion.&lt;ref name="d59"&gt;Decker (2008), 59&lt;/ref&gt; He wears the [[Crown of Thorns]]; its spikes spill blood across his face. His arms are heavily lacerated by what appear to be [[Scourging of Jesus|whip marks]], and he weakly raises his right hand to display the deep [[Five Holy Wounds|wound]] to his side, where according to [[Bible|scripture]], he was pierced by a [[Holy Lance|lance]] after his death on the cross.&lt;ref name="R150"/&gt; In 1927, Panofsky identified the panel in the tradition of iconic devotional depictions (''[[andachtsbilder]]'') of the "[[Man of Sorrows]]", noting especially its focus on the sacrificial aspect of the Passion and the its unflinching, yet emotive depiction of physical suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al (2005), 248&lt;/ref&gt; 

In some respects the work is unsophisticated; composed mainly from simplified geometric forms, while there is not much differentiation in the oval, idealised faces of the female figures. The clothes of any of the figures are not especially detailed; their volume and texture only suggested by the heavy folds.&lt;ref name="R152" /&gt; However, it is highly regarded for its complex and innovative composition, with many of the elements presented at oblique angles. It is very tightly cropped, for the era it was produced, cutting off the Magdalene and Evangelist would have been considered daring.&lt;ref name="R150"&gt;Ridderbos et al (2005), 150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attribution==
[[File:Triptych-with-the-entombment-of-christ-1822 (detail).jpg|200px|thumb|[[Robert Campin]], ''[[Seilern Triptych|Entombment]]'', c. 1410-15. [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], London]] 
The work is attributed to Geertgen tot Sint Jans mainly for its typically simplified geometric shapes, and similarity to his ''The Lamentation of Christ''; a painting in which the faces and expressions of Mary and John bear striking similarity to the present work. The attribution was accepted by both Friedländer and Panofsky. Especially Panofsky was enthusiastic about the panel, but Friedländer did not hold it in high regard. He praised the description of the Virgin, especially her face and hands, and described the depiction of the Magdalene as "realistic...with such carefully observed shadows" and "among the masters best work". However he found the figure of Christ to be "traditional", and wrote that the "absence of spatial elaboration overall is felt to be all the more vexing". Overall the image, he believed, lacked depth of field and compositional balance.&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, 23&lt;/ref&gt; 

Panofsky, although he generally admired Friedländer's analysis, disagreed strongly, and in a 1927 treatise on Netherlandish depictions of the "Man of Sorrows" wrote, "As, however, all the seemingly haphazard composition lines lead with compelling force to the face of the Savior, which, lifted out of the image, focuses its large, tearful eye on us, the sum of all the sorrows which he suffers, and all of the mourning that is suffered for him, now appears to besiege us."&lt;ref name="R153" /&gt;

==Provenance==
Nothing is record of the panel's commission or early owners.&lt;ref name="d61" /&gt;  Given the remnants of hinges on its frame, the work probably formed the left hand side of a diptych of which the opposite panel is now lost, possibly split up during the 18th century when composite works of this era were out of fashion and were broken up to be sold as individual easel pictures. The ''Man of Sorrows'' is thought to have been created as part of a series of small paintings for the [[Haarlem]] [[Janskerk (Haarlem)|Commandery of the Knights of St John]], a group of works that explore a range of human emotions.&lt;ref name="S29"&gt;Smith, 129&lt;/ref&gt; That group of paintings originally hung in the organisation's Church of St. John in [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref name="d61" /&gt;

'''Michael Andrew Fox''' {{post-nominals|OC}} (born June 9, 1961), known professionally as '''Michael J. Fox''', is a Canadian-American&lt;!-- Fox holds dual Canadian-US citizenship. --&gt; actor, author, film producer, activist and comedian with a film and television career spanning from the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/michael-j-fox-q-a-1.4017957|title=Michael J.

Other notable roles have included [[Mike Flaherty (Deputy Mayor)|Mike Flaherty]] on the [[American Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Spin City]]'' (1996–2000) and his portrayal of [[Alex P. Keaton]] on the American sitcom ''[[Family Ties]]''. He has won five [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, four [[Golden Globe Awards]], a [[Grammy Award]] and two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]].

Fox was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] in 1991 at age 29, and disclosed his condition to the public in 1998. He partly retired from acting in 2000 as the symptoms of his disease worsened. He has since become an advocate for research toward finding a cure; he created the [[The Michael J. Fox Foundation|Michael J. Fox Foundation]], and Sweden's [[Karolinska Institutet]] gave him an ''honoris causa'' doctorate on March 5, 2010 for his work advocating a cure for Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b170318_michael_j_fox_gets_doctored.html |title=Michael J.

Since 1999, Fox has mainly worked as a voice-over actor in films such as ''[[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]'' and [[Disney]]'s ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]''. On the [[CBS]] TV show ''[[The Good Wife]]'', he earned Emmy nominations for three consecutive years for his recurring role as crafty attorney Louis Canning.&lt;ref name="GoodWife"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bobbin|first1=Jay|title='The Good Wife' Season 5: Emmy nominee Michael J.

==Early life==
Michael Andrew Fox was born on June 9, 1961, in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada, to Phyllis (''née'' Piper), an actress/payroll clerk, and William Fox, a police officer and [[Canadian Forces]] member.&lt;ref name="actors"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Michael J.

Fox's family lived in various cities and towns across Canada because of his father's career.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; Their family finally moved to [[Burnaby]], a large suburb of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], when his father retired in 1971. His father died on January 6, 1990, from a heart attack.&lt;ref name=MikeBio&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/michael-story.html |title=Michael J. Fox Biography |publisher=The Michael J Fox Foundation |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox attended [[Burnaby Central Secondary School]], and now has a theatre named for him at [[Burnaby South Secondary]].&lt;ref name="Burnaby" /&gt; At age 15, Fox starred in the Canadian television series ''[[Leo and Me]]'', produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and in 1979, at age 18, he moved to Los Angeles to further his acting career. Shortly after his marriage, he decided to move back to Vancouver.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; Fox is one of four members of the ''Leo and Me'' cast and crew who eventually developed Parkinson's disease in mid-life, an unusually high number that led to some investigation as to whether an environmental factor may have played a role.&lt;ref name="Atkins"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/apr/04/medicalscience.healthandwellbeing|title=Can you catch Parkinson's?|last=Atkins|first=Lucy|date=April 4, 2002|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rocca"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/64051_mjfox27ww.shtml|title=Michael J.

Fox was discovered by producer Ronald Shedlo and made his American television debut in the television film ''Letters from Frank'', credited under the name "Michael Fox." He intended to continue to use the name, but when he registered with the [[Screen Actors Guild]], which requires unique registration names to avoid credit ambiguities (and the possibility that royalty checks would be sent to the wrong actors), he discovered that [[Michael Fox (American actor)|Michael Fox]], a veteran [[character actor]], was already registered under the name.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; As he explained in his autobiography, ''Lucky Man: A Memoir'' and in interviews, he needed to come up with a different name. He did not like the sound of "Michael A. Fox" during a time when "fox" was coming to mean "attractive" and because his middle initial sounded too much like the [[Eh#Canada|Canadian "eh?"]] He also didn't like the sound of "Andrew" or "Andy," so he decided to adopt a new middle initial and settled on "J," as a tribute to actor [[Michael J. Pollard]].&lt;ref name=MikeBio /&gt;

==Acting career==

===Early career===

Fox|work=Television Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; in August 1988 shortly after they were married]]

Fox's first feature film roles were ''[[Midnight Madness (film)|Midnight Madness]]'' (1980) and ''[[Class of 1984]]'' (1982), credited in both as Michael Fox. Shortly afterward, he began playing "Young Republican" [[Alex P. Keaton]] in the show ''[[Family Ties]]'', which aired on [[NBC]] for seven seasons from 1982–89. In an interview with [[Jimmy Fallon]] in April 2014, Fox stated he negotiated the role at a payphone at [[Pioneer Chicken]]. He received the role only after [[Matthew Broderick]] was unavailable.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt; ''Family Ties'' had been sold to the television network using the pitch "[[Hip (slang)|Hip]] parents, [[Square (slang)|square]] kids",&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite web|last=Haglund |first=David |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/dvdextras/2007/03/reagans_favorite_sitcom.single.html |title=Reagan's Favorite Sitcom: How Family Ties spawned a conservative hero |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=March 2, 2007 |accessdate=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the parents originally intended to be the main characters. However, the positive reaction to Fox's performance led to his character becoming the focus of the show following the fourth episode.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt; At its peak, the audience for ''Family Ties'' drew one-third of America's households every week.&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; Fox won three [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] awards for ''Family Ties'' in 1986, 1987, and 1988.&lt;ref name="Emmy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search?person=michael+j+fox&amp;program=&amp;start_year=0&amp;end_year=2010&amp;network=All&amp;web_category=All&amp;winner=All|title=EMMY Award History|date=|publisher=EMMY Official Website|accessdate=August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also won a [[Golden Globe Award]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="globes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.com/person/michael-j-fox|title=Golden Globe Awards for Michael J. Fox|date=|publisher=Golden Globes Official Website|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brandon Tartikoff]], one of the show's producers, felt that Fox was too short in relation to the actors playing his parents, and tried to have him replaced. Tartikoff reportedly said that "this is not the kind of face you'll ever find on a lunch-box." After his later successes, Fox presented Tartikoff with a custom-made lunch-box with the inscription "To Brandon, this is for you to put your [[eating crow|crow in]]. Love and Kisses, Michael J. Fox." Tartikoff kept the lunch-box in his office for the rest of his NBC career.&lt;ref name="LuckyMan"&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

While filming ''Family Ties'', Fox met his wife, [[Tracy Pollan]], who portrayed his girlfriend, Ellen.&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; When Fox left the TV series ''[[Spin City]]'', his final episodes made numerous allusions to ''Family Ties'': [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]] (who played Alex's father Steven) portrays Mike Flaherty's (Fox's character's) therapist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/20/entertainment/ca-10674 |title=Putting His Own Spin on 'City's' Season Finale |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 20, 2000 |accessdate=August 23, 2010 | first=Amy | last=Wallace}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a reference to an off-screen character named "[[Justine Bateman|Mallory]]".&lt;ref&gt;Shales, Tom.

''[[Washington Post]]'', May 24, 2000, C1.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, when Flaherty becomes an environmental [[lobbyist]] in Washington, D.C., he meets a conservative senator from [[Ohio]] named Alex P. Keaton, and in one episode [[Meredith Baxter]] played Mike's mother.

As a consequence of working in ''Family Ties'', as well as his acting in ''Teen Wolf'' and ''Back to the Future'', Fox became a [[teen idol]]. [[VH1]]'s show ''The Greatest'' later naming him among their "50 Greatest Teen Idols."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vh1.com/shows/the_greatest/episode.jhtml?episodeID=67297|title = Episode 080: 50 Greatest Teen Idols|website = VH1|accessdate = October 21, 2015|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120209143618/http://www.vh1.com/shows/the_greatest/episode.jhtml?episodeID=67297|archivedate = February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film career===
[[File:Michael J Fox 1988-cropped1.jpg|thumb|upright|Fox at the [[40th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in August 1988]]

In January 1985, Fox was cast to replace [[Eric Stoltz]] as [[Marty McFly]], a teenager who is accidentally sent [[Time travel|back in time]] from 1985 to 1955 in ''[[Back to the Future]]''.
[[Robert Zemeckis]], the director, originally wanted Fox to play Marty, but [[Gary David Goldberg]] the creator of ''[[Family Ties]]'', which Fox was working on at the time, refused to allow Zemeckis even to approach Fox as he felt that as [[Meredith Baxter]] was on maternity leave at the time, Fox's character [[Alex Keaton]] was needed to carry the show in her absence. Eric Stoltz was cast and was already filming ''Back to the Future'', but Zemeckis felt that Stoltz was not giving the right type of performance for the humor involved.&lt;ref name="Making"&gt;"Back to the Future: Making the Trilogy: Chapter 1 (DVD Documentary)"&lt;/ref&gt; Zemeckis quickly replaced Stoltz with Fox, whose schedule was now more open with the return of Meredith Baxter. He was considered for the role of Mark Kendall in ''[[Once Bitten (1985 film)|Once Bitten]]'', but it eventually went to [[Jim Carrey]]. During filming, Fox would rehearse for ''Family Ties'' from 10 a.m to 6 p.m, then rush to the ''Back to the Future'' set where he would rehearse and shoot until 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. This schedule lasted for two full months. ''Back to the Future'' was both a commercial and critical success. The film spent 8 consecutive weekends as the number-one grossing movie at the US box office in 1985 and eventually earned a worldwide total of $381.11 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=backtothefuture.htm |title=Back to the Future Box Office Mojo |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' applauded the performances, stating that Fox and his co-star [[Christopher Lloyd]] imbued Marty and [[Emmett Brown|Doc Brown]]'s friendship with a quality reminiscent of [[King Arthur]] and [[Merlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = Variety | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117788826 | date = July 1, 1985 | title = Back to the Future | accessdate = October 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was later followed by two similarly-successful sequels, ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989) and ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990).

[[File:Michael J. Fox (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fox at the [[39th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in September 1987]]

During and immediately after the [[Back to the Future trilogy|''Back to the Future'' trilogy]], Fox starred in ''[[Teen Wolf]]'' (1985),'' [[Light of Day]]'' (1987), ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of My Success]]'' (1987), ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (film)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'' (1988), and ''[[Casualties of War]]'' (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ws5CDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2016-IA67&amp;lpg=PA2016-IA67&amp;dq=after+the+Back+to+the+Future+trilogy,+Fox+starred+in+Teen+Wolf+(1985),+Light+of+Day+(1987),+The+Secret+of+My+Success+(1987),+Bright+Lights,+Big+City+(1988),+and+Casualties+of+War+(1989).#v=onepage&amp;q=after%20the%20Back%20to%20the%20Future%20trilogy,%20Fox%20starred%20in%20Teen%20Wolf%20(1985),%20Light%20of%20Day%20(1987),%20The%20Secret%20of%20My%20Success%20(1987),%20Bright%20Lights,%20Big%20City%20(1988),%20and%20Casualties%20of%20War%20(1989).&amp;f=false|title=Focus On: 100 Most Popular Canadian Male Film Actors|last=contributors|first=Wikipedia|publisher=e-artnow sro|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Secret of My Success'', Fox played a recent graduate from [[Kansas State University]] who moves to New York City, where he has to deal with the ups and downs of the business world. The film was successful at the box office, grossing $110 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=secretofmysuccess.htm |title=The Secret of My Success Box Office Mojo |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date= |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] in ''The Chicago Sun Times'' wrote; "Fox provides a fairly desperate center for the film. It could not have been much fun for him to follow the movie's arbitrary shifts of mood, from sitcom to slapstick, from sex farce to boardroom brawls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870410/REVIEWS/704100301 |title=The Secret of My Success Review |work=[[Chicago Sun Times]] |date=April 10, 1987 |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (film)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'', Fox played a fact-checker for a New York magazine, who spends his nights partying with alcohol and drugs. The film received mixed reviews, with Hal Hinson in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' criticizing Fox by claiming that "he was the wrong actor for the job".&lt;ref name="hinson"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hinson | first = Hal | title = ''City'' Blight | work = Washington Post | pages = | date = April 1, 1988 | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Roger Ebert praised the actor's performance: "Fox is very good in the central role (he has a long drunken monologue that is the best thing he has ever done in a movie)".&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | title = ''Bright Lights, Big City'' | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | pages = | date = April 1, 1988 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19880401/REVIEWS/804010301/1023 | accessdate = June 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the shooting of ''Bright Lights, Big City'', Fox co-starred again with [[Tracy Pollan]], his on-screen girlfriend from ''[[Family Ties]]''.

Fox then starred in ''[[Casualties of War]]'', a dark and violent war drama about the [[Vietnam War]], alongside [[Sean Penn]]. ''Casualties of War'' was not a major box office hit, but Fox, playing a private serving in [[Vietnam]], received good reviews for his performance. Don Willmott on film critic's website wrote; "Fox, only one year beyond his ''[[Family Ties]]'' sitcom silliness, rises to the challenges of acting as the film's moral voice and sharing scenes with the always intimidating Penn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/1989/casualties-of-war/ |title=Casualties of War Review |publisher=Film Critic Website |date=January 4, 2006 |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113234717/http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/1989/casualties-of-war/ |archivedate=November 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, he starred in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'', a romantic comedy about a talented medical doctor who decides to become a plastic surgeon. While moving from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, he winds up as a doctor in a small southern town in South Carolina. [[Michael Caton-Jones]], from ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'', described Fox in the film as "at his frenetic best".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/65559/doc_hollywood.html |title=Doc Hollywood Review |work=Time Out |date= |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118081240/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/65559/doc_hollywood.html |archivedate=November 18, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hard Way (1991 film)|The Hard Way]]'' was also released in 1991, with Fox playing an undercover actor learning from police officer [[James Woods]]. After being privately diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in 1991 and being cautioned he had "ten good working years left", Fox hastily signed a three-film contract, appearing in ''[[For Love or Money (1993 film)|For Love or Money]]'' (1993), ''[[Life With Mikey]]'' (1993), and ''[[Greedy (film)|Greedy]]'' (1994).  The mid-1990s saw Fox play smaller supporting roles in ''[[The American President]]'' (1995) and ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'' (1996).&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt;

His last major film role was in ''[[The Frighteners]]'' (1996), directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. ''[[The Frighteners]]'' tells the story of Frank Bannister (Fox), an architect who develops psychic abilities allowing him to see, hear, and communicate with ghosts. After losing his wife, he uses his new abilities by cheating customers out of money for his "ghost hunting" business.

Fox started displaying symptoms of early-onset [[Parkinson's disease]] in 1991 while shooting the movie ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'', although he was not properly diagnosed until the next year.&lt;ref name="QuitsSpinCity" /&gt; After his diagnosis, Fox started drinking heavily.

His first book, ''Lucky Man'', focused on how, after seven years of denial of the disease, he set up the Michael J.

In ''Lucky Man'', Fox wrote that he did not take his medication prior to his testimony before the [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Appropriations Subcommittee]] in 1999 ([[:File:Michael J.

In an interview with [[NPR]] in April 2002,&lt;ref name="NPR Fresh Air"/&gt; Fox explained what he does when he becomes symptomatic during an interview:

{{Quote|quote = Well, actually, I've been erring on the side of caution—I think 'erring' is actually the right word—in that I've been medicating perhaps too much, in the sense [that] ... the symptoms ... people see in some of these interviews that [I] have been on are actually [[dyskinesia]], which is a reaction to the medication. Because if I were purely symptomatic with Parkinson's symptoms, a lot of times speaking is difficult. There's a kind of a [[cluttering]] of speech and it's very difficult to sit still, to sit in one place. You know, the symptoms are different, so I'd rather kind of suffer the symptoms of dyskinesia... this kind of weaving and this kind of continuous thing is much preferable, actually, than pure Parkinson's symptoms. So that's what I generally do... I haven't had any, you know, problems with pure Parkinson's symptoms in any of these interviews, because I'll tend to just make sure that I have enough [[Sinemet]] in my system and, in some cases, too much. But to me, it's preferable. It's not representative of what I'm like in my everyday life. I get a lot of people with Parkinson's coming up to me saying, 'You take too much medication.' I say, 'Well, you sit across from [[Larry King]] and see if you want to tempt it.'

In 2006, Fox starred in a [[campaign ad]] for then [[State Auditor of Missouri]] [[Claire McCaskill]] (D) in her successful [[United States Senate election in Missouri, 2006|2006 Senate campaign]] against incumbent [[Jim Talent]] (R), expressing her support for embryonic [[stem cell]] research. In the ad, he visibly showed the effects of his Parkinson's disease:

{{Quote

Unfortunately, Senator Jim Talent opposes expanding stem cell research. Senator Talent even wanted to criminalize the science that gives us the chance for hope.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10516">[[File:Min-On Music Museum.JPG|thumb|The Min-On Culture Center in Tokyo, which houses the association and its music museum and library]]
The '''{{Nihongo|Min-On Concert Association|民主音楽協会|Minshu Ongaku Kyōkai}}''' is a Japan-based organization that promotes international music and performing arts exchanges. Founded in 1963 by [[Daisaku Ikeda]], the organization also runs the '''Tokyo International Music Competition for Conducting''' as well as a music museum and library. The organization's offices, library and museum are located in the Min-On Culture Center in the [[Shinjuku-ku]] district of Tokyo.

==History==
During the 1960s and into the 1980s, [[Daisaku Ikeda]] (at the time the president of the [[Soka Gakkai]]) established a number of cultural programs and institutions including the Institute of Oriental Philosophy, the Min-on Concert Association, and the [[Tokyo Fuji Art Museum]]. The Min-On Concert Association was established in 1963. It arose from Ikeda's perception that access to high-quality live music performances was beyond the reach of the majority of Japanese people. "Min-On" is an abbreviation of "Minshu Ongaku" or "Music for the People". The association began with a series of subscription concerts and became a foundation in 1965. Ikeda's other goal for Min-On was to promote cross-cultural understanding through music, and to that end the association also began a series of exchanges which introduced performing artists from other countries to Japanese audiences and sent Japanese artists abroad.{{r|Seager}}{{r|Norton}}{{r|Galliano}}

In its early years, the organization was sometimes dismissed as sectarian. However, according to its past president Hiroyasu Kobayashi, that perception began to change in  1981 when Min-On underwrote a tour by Milan's [[La Scala]] opera company, one of the first Western opera companies to perform in Japan. In 1997, the Min-On Cultural Center was opened in downtown Tokyo and now houses the organization's offices as well as its music museum and library. By the end of the 1990s Min-On had organized 70,000 concerts with performers from 100 different countries and attended by over 100 million people in Japan.{{r|Laurence2017}}{{r|Galliano}}

==Activities==
Min-On's three main activities are its concerts, the Tokyo International Music Competition, and its music museum and library. However, it also runs the  Min-On Music Research Institute, organizes lectures and conferences on music, and publishes books and monographs.{{r|Laurence2017}}{{r|MLAJ}}

===Concerts===
Min-On's concert performances are held not only in the concert halls of major Japanese cities but also in small towns in the Japanese hinterland. The concerts present a wide range of styles and genres including European and [[Chinese opera]], ballet, and indigenous folk music. In the late 1960s Min-On began its World Ballet Series which brought tours by the [[American Ballet Theatre]] and [[The Royal Ballet]] to Japan. In 1968 its also brought the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] to Japan for a three-week concert tour. The [[La Scala]] tour of 1981 was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "the cultural event of the year in Japan."{{r|NYT1}} The company gave 24 performances in Tokyo, Osaka and Yokohama with all performances televised by [[NHK]]. There were also two chamber music concerts by the La Scala Octet. Other classical performers who have appeared in Japan under the auspices of Min-On include the singers [[Plácido Domingo]], [[Roberto Alagna]], and [[Charlotte Henriette de Rothschild|Charlotte de Rothschild]] and the Brazilian pianist [[José Carlos Amaral Vieira|Amaral Vieira]] who has made multiple tours for Min-On since the early 1990s.{{r|OCLC1}}{{r|Billboard1}}{{r|Rothschild}}{{r|Seager}}

The Min-On Festival of Contemporary Music ran from 1969 to 1990 in conjunction with the Tokyo International Music Competition. The concerts were given at the [[Tokyo Bunka Kaikan]] concert hall and presented contemporary works by Japanese composers, several of them commissioned by the association. Recordings of the festival concerts given between 1979 and 1988 were released on the Japanese label Camerata.{{r|LOC}} Min-On's annual Tango Concert Series, a long-running cultural exchange program between Japan and Argentina, began in 1970 began with a tour by the orchestra of {{ill|José Basso|es}} and the singers [[Alfredo Belusi]] and Carlos Rossi. In 2011 Jamaica became the 104th country to tour Japan under the auspices Min-On. The tour was the second in Min-On's ''Caribbean Musical Cruise'' series. The series began in 2009 with a tour of artists from [[Trinidad and Tobago]].{{r|Masami}}{{r|Gleaner}}

===Tokyo International Music Competition===
Min-On established the Tokyo International Music Competition in 1966 as a competition for singers. A category for chamber ensembles was introduced in 1974. However, the longest running of the categories has been the conducting competition which began in 1967 and is held every three years. Two of the past first prize winners, Yukinori Tezuka (1967) and [[Kazuhiro Koizumi]] (1970) became conductors of the [[New Japan Philharmonic]]. Olivier Grangean, who won the 1991 competition, later became [[music director]] of the [[National Symphony Orchestra of Colombia]]. No first prizes were awarded for the 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012 competitions. In 2015, the first prize was awarded to the Spanish conductor {{ill|Diego Martin-Etxebarria|es}}.{{r|Competitions}}{{r|NJP}}{{r|Bogota}}{{r|ABC}}

===Music museum and library===
Min-On's  music museum has collections of pianos, [[music box]]es, and ethnic musical instruments from a variety of cultures. The piano collection includes an [[Anton Walter]] piano from the early 1780s as well the piano used for 30 years by the jazz musician [[Herbie Hancock]] who donated it to the museum.{{r|Hancock}}

As of 2006, the library held 30,000 books, 45,000 volumes of sheet music, 200 magazine titles, and a large collection of [[piano roll]]s. It also holds thousands of photographs and audio and video recordings.{{r|MLAJ}}

'''''Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe''''' ({{Lang-fr|'''Memoirs from Beyond the Grave'''}}) is the [[memoir]] of [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] (1768–1848), collected and published posthumously in two volumes in 1849 and 1850, respectively. Chateaubriand was a writer, politician, diplomat, and historian who is regarded as the founder of French [[Romanticism]].

Although the work shares characteristics with earlier French "memoirs" (like the ''Memoirs'' of [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]]), the ''Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe'' are also inspired by the ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]: in addition to providing a record of political and historical events, Chateaubriand includes details of his private life and his personal aspirations.

The work abounds in instances of the poetic prose at which Chateaubriand excelled. On the other hand, the melancholy of the autobiography helped establish Chateaubriand as the idol of the young French Romantics; a young [[Victor Hugo]] wrote: "I will be Chateaubriand or nothing."

== Genesis of the work ==
[[Image:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 006.jpg|thumb|''Chateaubriand Meditating on the Ruins of Rome'' (c. 1810s) by [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]]. Oil on canvas.]]
	
It was while in [[Rome]] at the close of 1803 that Chateaubriand decided to write his memoirs; however, he did not begin writing them until 1809, and even then demands from other projects slowed his progress. In 1817 he returned to the memoirs. The first manuscript, probably written while he was serving as ambassador to [[London]], did not reach completion until 1826. At this point, he intended to entitle the book ''Memories of My Life''.

In 1830, however, Chateaubriand decided to change the scope of the work, revising the title to ''Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe'', making a thorough revision of the original text, and writing several new volumes. He divided his life before 1830 into three periods: soldier and traveler, novelist, and statesman. The project had by now become more ambitious; indeed, he tried to reproduce not only his personal exploits, but the epic historical and political events of the era.

==Publication==
After fragmented public readings of his work in [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]s, in 1836 Chateaubriand yielded the rights to his work to a society that published it until his death, paying him accordingly. Having obtained this economic stability, he completed the work with a fourth set of volumes. In 1841 he wrote an ample conclusion.

Chateaubriand originally intended for the work to be published at least fifty years after his death, but his financial troubles forced him, in his words, "to mortgage [his] tomb".

==English translations==
There have been a number of English translations. British author Anthony Kline published a complete translation in 2005 that is freely available for non-commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/MEMOIRESDOUTRETOMBE |title=Memoires D'Outre Tomb |publisher= |author=François de Chateaubriand |year=2005 |page= |accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Chateaubriand/Chathome.php |title=Mémoires d’Outre-Tombe |work=Poetry in Translation |author=Anthony Kline |date=2005 |accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An abridged translation by Robert Baldick was first published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1961, and later, in paperback, by Penguin books in 1972. A [[New York Review of Books]] edition translated by Alex Andriesse was published in 2018, covering the years 1768-1800 (first 12 of 42 books).

'''''Nocturne: Blue and Gold – Old Battersea Bridge''''' is a painting by the [[United States|American]] artist [[James McNeill Whistler]], now held in the collections of [[Tate Britain]]. It was painted around 1872–5.

This painting is of the old wooden [[Battersea Bridge]] across the [[River Thames]] before it was replaced by the modern bridge. [[Chelsea Old Church]] to the left (on the north bank of the river) and the then recently built [[Albert Bridge, London|Albert Bridge]] to the right, with fireworks above, can be seen in the distance. The picture is an evening view and is full of atmospheric effect. The bridge is painted taller than it actually was for added effect. [[Hokusai]], a favorite artist of Whistler's from [[Japan]], produced a similar picture of a tall wooden bridge with fireworks.

The painting was presented to the [[Tate Gallery]] by the [[The Art Fund|National Art Collections Fund]] in 1905.

Whistler's ''Nocturne'' series, of which this painting was a part, achieved notoriety in 1877, when influential critic [[John Ruskin]] visited an exhibition of the series at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]]. He wrote of the exhibition that Whistler was "asking two hundred [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face". Whistler sued for libel, the case reaching the courts in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Steiner|first=Wendy|date=January 1993|title=A Pot of Paint: Aesthetics on Trial in Whistler v. Ruskin|journal=Art in America|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n1_v81/ai_13295552/|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge in the case, one Baron Huddleston, caused laughter in the court when he (apparently sincerely) asked Whistler "Which part of the picture is the bridge?" &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Whistler|first=James|date=1890|title=The Gentle Art of Making Enemies|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxgEAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case ended with Whistler awarded token damages of one [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]].{{sfn|Cookson|2006|p=122}}

In 1905, ''Nocturne: Blue and Gold'' became the first significant acquisition by the newly formed [[National Art Collections Fund]], and now hangs in [[Tate Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Moore|first=Susan|date=2003-11-01|title=Guardian of the nation's treasures|newspaper=The Spectator|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pregnancy in art''' covers any [[artistic work]] that portrays [[pregnancy]] in women.  In art as in life, it is often unclear whether an actual state of pregnancy is intended to be shown.  A common visual indication is the gesture of the woman placing a protective open hand on her abdomen.  Historically, married women were at some stage of pregnancy for much of their life until the [[menopause]], but the depiction of this in art is relatively uncommon,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79792 MOMA, New York, Note on Klimt's ''Hope II'']&lt;/ref&gt; and generally restricted to some specific contexts.  This probably persists even in contemporary culture; despite several recent artworks depicting heavily pregnant women, one writer was "astonished at the shortage of visual images&amp;nbsp;... of pregnant women in public visual culture".&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;  A research study conducted by [[Pierre Bourdieu]] in 1963 found that the great majority of 693 French subjects thought that a photo of a pregnant woman could not, by definition, be beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two subjects often depicted in Western narrative art, or [[history painting]], where pregnancy is an important part of the story.  These are the unhappy scene usually called ''Diana and Callisto'', showing the moment of discovery of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]'s forbidden pregnancy, and the biblical scene of the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 251; the entry on "Pregnancy" mentions only these two.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gradually, portraits of pregnant women began to appear, with a particular fashion for "pregnancy portraits" in elite portraiture of the years around 1600.

As well as being a subject for depiction in art, pregnant women were also consumers of art, with some special types of work developed for them, including ''Madonna del Parto'' images of Mary.

==Traditional cultures==
Images of pregnant women, especially small [[figurine]]s, were made in traditional cultures in many places and periods, though it is rarely one of the most common types  of image.  These include ceramic figures from some [[Pre-Columbian]] cultures, and a few figures from most of the ancient Mediterranean cultures. Many of these seem to be connected with [[fertility in art|fertility]].  Identifying whether such figures are actually meant to show pregnancy is often a problem, as well as understanding their role in the culture concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay, Lauren E., "Archaeological Ms.conceptions: Contemplating Gender and the Greek Neolithic", in ''Representations of Gender From Prehistory To the Present'', 5-9, 2000, Springer, {{ISBN|1349623318}}, 9781349623310.  For an international survey of the subject in general, see ''The Oxford Handbook of Prehistoric Figurines'', ed. Timothy Insoll, 2017, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0199675619}}, 9780199675616, which has few mentions of pregnancy in its 900 pages. For Pre-Classic examples from the Highlands of [[Guatemala]], see [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5QJlCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10 ''Handbook of Middle American Indians'', Volumes 2 and 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the oldest surviving examples of the depiction of pregnancy are prehistoric [[figurines]] found across much of [[Eurasia]] and collectively known as [[Venus figurines]].  The best known is the [[Venus of Willendorf]], an [[Jurassic|oolitic]] [[limestone]] figurine of a woman whose breasts and hips have been exaggerated to emphasise her fertility. These figurines exaggerate the [[abdomen]], [[hips]], [[breasts]], [[thighs]], or [[vulva]] of the subject, but the degree to which the figures appear to be pregnant varies considerably, and most are not noticeably pregnant at all.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 747; Cook&lt;/ref&gt;  An inevitably subjective survey of the corpus of about 140 figurines concluded that only 17% of them represented pregnant women, extending to 39% "which could possibly represent pregnancy".&lt;ref&gt;Taiz, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western art==
[[Image:TitianDianaCallistoEdinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]]'s ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'', 1559, shows the moment when [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]'s pregnancy is discovered]]
In Europe, depictions of pregnancy were largely avoided in [[classical art]] (apart from small [[Votive offering|votive figure]]s), but later Western art had two subjects that were frequently depicted where pregnancy was integral to the narrative.

===Callisto===
In [[Greek mythology]] the nymph [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]] became pregnant by [[Zeus]] (Jupiter to the Romans) in disguise. Her pregnancy was spotted when she was bathing, and her furious mistress [[Artemis]] (Diana) sent her away; Jupiter's wife [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] then turned her into a bear.  The few classical depictions tended to show this transformation, but in later art the traumatic moment of discovery was most often depicted, especially from the Renaissance onwards, using the Roman poet [[Ovid]] as the source.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 102–103, 251; Roberts, 752&lt;/ref&gt;

What became the typical composition was first seen in [[Titian]]'s ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'' (1559), where Callisto's abdomen is exposed as Artemis/Diana points accusingly at her and her other followers display a variety of reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 102–103, 251; Roberts, 752&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Ovid places the discovery in the ninth month of Callisto's pregnancy ([[Metamorphoses]] II, [http://ovid.lib.virginia.edu/trans/Metamorph2.htm#476707506 441–465]), in paintings she is generally shown with a rather modest bump for late pregnancy.  But this is appropriate as the scene shows the moment when her intimate companions first realized that she was pregnant.  It is clear that the main attraction of the subject was the opportunity to depict a group of female nudes,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 752&lt;/ref&gt; though it could be claimed that it illustrated the serious consequences of an unwanted pregnancy.

===Virgin Mary===
Depictions of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] were by far the most frequent images featuring a pregnant woman in post-classical Western art, and probably remain so to the modern day.  The moment of Mary's conception of Jesus, called the [[Annunciation]], is [[Annunciation in Christian art|one of the most common]] subjects in traditional Christian art,&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 35–52&lt;/ref&gt; but depictions from later in her pregnancy are also common.  Unlike many other kinds of depictions of pregnancy, there is usually no ambiguity as to whether Mary is intended to be shown while pregnant, even where the pregnancy is not clearly visualized.  
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Visitation - WGA25716.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]]'' by [[Rogier van der Weyden]] (1430s, now [[Leipzig]]) with open laces on Elizabeth.]]
The [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], a meeting between two pregnant women, Mary and [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]], as recorded in the [[Gospel of Luke]] {{bibleref2|Luke|1:39–56|64}}, was very often depicted,&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 55&lt;/ref&gt; but their pregnancy is usually not emphasized visually, at least until [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1; Roberts, 749&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval thinking held that Elizabeth was about seven months pregnant at the meeting, and Mary about one.&lt;ref&gt;Following {{bibleref|Luke|1:26|9}}, where Elizabeth is six months pregnant at the [[Annunciation]].  The relevant medieval Western feasts were [[Feast of the Annunciation]] on 25 March, [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]] on 25 June, and Christmas on 25 December.  The feast of the Visitation itself was on 2 July, rather illogically, as it was then after the birth of John.&lt;/ref&gt;

The loose full clothes used in religious art, as in normal medieval life, make it hard to detect in any case.  In late medieval paintings they may be shown with vertical gaps in their clothes; female medieval dress had openings that were normally closed by laces when dressing, but could be left open during pregnancy.  These may be either at the front or the sides, and are used in art to indicate pregnancy, although from about 1450 such gaps, revealing a contrasting colour of undergarment, became a fashion and can be seen in art on slim, unmarried women.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases one or other places a hand on the bump of the other, as in [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s [[Leipzig]] version (illustrated).  A few images, mostly Byzantine or Late Medieval German, show their unborn children in the womb, as though in a modern [[cutaway drawing]]. In German images they are naked (though usually with halos)  and [[John the Baptist]] bows or kneels to Jesus, who raises a hand in blessing.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 56; Hall, 251, 337; Roberts, 749&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be emphasized that in all periods the majority of depictions have little visual indication that either woman is pregnant; the story was well-known to its audience.

Some other images showed the pregnant Virgin with [[Saint Joseph]] or other relatives, including some of the ''Journey to Bethlehem'' for the birth.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 749&lt;/ref&gt;  This last was a standard part of [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] cycles, but rare in the Western church.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 58&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a few images of Joseph and Mary looking for shelter or being turned away at the inn in [[Bethlehem]], mostly from north of the Alps after 1500; in these Mary is usually clearly pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;The subject is not covered by Schiller. It is called the ''Herbergssuche'' ("Search for shelter") in German. See [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mary_and_Joseph_seeking_refuge the category on Wikimedia Commons].&lt;/ref&gt;

The rare subject of the ''Doubting of Joseph'' also needed to establish Mary's pregnancy, and some versions indicated this by unlaced openings in her dress or a "cutaway" unborn Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1, after fig 1.5, illustrates both types; Schiller, 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;  In this scene, based on {{bibleref2|Matthew|1:18–25|64}} and [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] elaborations, Joseph is unsettled by the pregnancy of his virgin bride, but is later reassured by an angel who comes to him in a dream, the first of his [[Saint Joseph's dreams|four dreams]] in Matthew.  Mary is often shown spinning while pregnant; the spinning figure with "cutaway" illustrated has Joseph's head appearing through the tracery at left.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 57, figs 141 and 142&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar painting in [[Budapest]], where Mary spun while Joseph slept and the angel appeared to him, the unborn Jesus is not visible in the painting now, but can be seen in the [[underdrawing]] with [[infrared reflectography]].  Either the artist or patron had a change of mind at the time, or it was overpainted later, perhaps as the motif came to be felt indecorous or primitive.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Maria gravida, or Mary at the Spinning Wheel from Németújvár (c.1410, Hungarian gallery).jpg|Image, with note from the Hungarian National gallery]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other similar images are of Mary alone, especially as statues; these are called ''Maria gravida'' ("Pregnant Mary") and are covered below.
[[File:Piero Madonna del parto.jpg|thumb|''[[Madonna del Parto]]'' by [[Piero della Francesca]], c. 1460, with unlacing at the front and side.]]

A number of Early Netherlandish paintings show [[Mary Magdalene]] with the same unlaced opening in her dress.  Penny Howell Jolly has proposed that this motif represents her "spiritual pregnancy", although in his account of the most famous example, ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|The Descent from the Cross]]'' by van der Weyden (c. 1435, now [[Prado]]) [[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] notes the unlacing, but attributes it merely to Mary Magdalene's distressed condition.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madonna del Parto]] is a term for figures of the [[Virgin Mary]] especially associated with pregnancy and childbirth, or showing the Virgin pregnant.  These are not very common; the best known is the [[fresco]] by [[Piero della Francesca]], where a heavily pregnant Mary has a prominent unlaced opening at the front of her dress, and another at the side.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these depictions fell from fashion during the Renaissance, and the Piero is the latest known from [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferrie&lt;/ref&gt;  These attracted the devotions of pregnant women or those concerned for them, as well as those wanting a pregnancy.  Queen [[Claude of France]], who had seven children before dying at the age of 24, had the painting of the ''Visitation'' by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]] (now [[Louvre]]) in her chamber.&lt;ref&gt;"Claude de France", 80–81, ''Encyclopedia of Women in the Renaissance: Italy, France, and England'', edited by Diana Maury Robin, Anne R. Larsen, Carole Levin, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OQ8mdTjxungC&amp;pg=PA81 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

A few of these images of Mary feature a "cutaway" view of Jesus ''in utero'' within, as found in some images of the ''Visitation'' (see above),&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 749&lt;/ref&gt; and many have the same protective gesture of the hand on the stomach, which also features in portraits of pregnant women when these begin to appear.  After the [[Counter-Reformation]] a visualized ''in utero'' Jesus becomes rare, and instead Mary may be shown with the [[Christogram]] "IHS" on her stomach.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mary_with_Jesus_shown_%27%27in_utero%27%27 the Wikimedia Commons category]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Eastern Orthodox]] icons, the ''in utero'' Jesus, which is normally fully clothed, remains part of the tradition for certain representations to the present day. It is found in one of the most famous [[Russian icon]]s, the 12th-century [[Ustyug Annunciation]] in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]], Moscow, which has the birth-size Child shown inside the chest area, and in the icons of Mary of the type known as ''Pomozhenie rodam'' in Russian, translated as "Help in childbirth"  (or "Succour in travail").

===Portraits===
[[File:Attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts II - Portrait of an Unknown Lady - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|English "pregnancy portrait" of an unknown lady, attributed to [[Marcus Gheeraerts II]], c. 1595&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gheeraerts-portrait-of-an-unknown-lady-t07699 Tate page], attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts II, ''Portrait of an Unknown Lady'', c.1595&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the [[Late Middle Ages|Late Medieval Period]], portraits of pregnant-looking women began to be painted, though the fashion for dresses gathered at the front makes these difficult to interpret or identify with confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1, after fig 1.5&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Arnolfini portrait]] by [[Jan van Eyck]] of 1434 might be an example of pregnancy, but the current views of art historians are mostly against this, as virgin saints were often shown in much the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Edwin, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IJOwCF2xkc4C The Arnolfini Betrothal: Medieval Marriage and the Enigma of Van Eyck's Double Portrait]'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 1015-106, 1994, {{ISBN|0-520-08251-6}}. The text is also available from the [http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft1d5nb0d9/ California Digital Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  The virgin martyr and "princess" Saint [[Catherine of Alexandria]], usually dressed in the height of fashion in this period, was also the [[patron saint]] of childbirth, so there may be a degree of deliberate ambiguity in images of her.

Some Italian Renaissance portraits thought to be of pregnant women show them wearing a gauzy underdress called a ''guarnello'', often associated with pregnancy or the period after childbirth. These include [[Leonardo Da Vinci]]'s [[Mona Lisa]], where the garment first became visible under [[infrared and thermal testing|infra-red scans]] in 2006, suggesting that [[Lisa del Giocondo]], the sitter, was pregnant or just had a baby when she was painted.  Another painting with a ''guarnello'' is [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[Portrait of a Lady Known as Smeralda Brandini]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15029288/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/was-mona-lisa-pregnant-when-she-posed/#.WQFLcNz_qM8 "Was Mona Lisa pregnant when she posed?"], [[Associated Press]], carried by NBC, 27 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; where the sitter also holds a hand over the top of her bump.  This is a feature seen in many images such as ''Visitation'' scenes where pregnancy is certain, and that probably indicates it in cases where it is much less clear, including some portraits by [[Anthony van Dyck]].&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 43, note 18&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[La Donna Gravida]]'' ("The Pregnant Lady") by [[Raphael]] is another example, with an apparently pregnant woman sitting with her left hand over her stomach, but such depictions remained infrequent in [[Renaissance art]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 750&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception to this is the "pregnancy portrait" (a term first used by Karen Hearn, a [[Tate Britain]] curator) of a woman shown as heavily pregnant, usually standing.  These are especially found in England, where the fashion may have been popularized in about the 1590s by [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]], an English painter of Flemish parentage, who was the leading English painter of these portraits.  Part of the reason for them may have been the risk to the mother of childbirth and some may well be posthumous.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some earlier examples from court portraiture on the Continent,&lt;ref&gt;"'Only matrimony maketh children to be certain...': Two Elizabethan pregnancy portraits", 19, Pauline Croft and Karen Hearn, ''The British Art Journal'', Vol. 3, No. 3 (Autumn 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and in England,&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; but the main group of English portraits dates from roughly the late 1580s to about 1630.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 40&lt;/ref&gt;  At around the same time as the English examples [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Spain]] sent portraits of herself while pregnant to close female friends and relations.&lt;ref&gt;Anne J. Cruz, Maria Galli Stampino, eds., ''Early Modern Habsburg Women: Transnational Contexts, Cultural Conflicts, Dynastic Continuities'', 156, 2016, Routledge, {{ISBN|1317146921}}, 9781317146926, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=plkfDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  The example illustrated below by her court painter [[Bartolomé González y Serrano]], which was sent back home to the Austrian Habsburgs, only varies her standard official portrait by exchanging her daughter for the usual dog or chair at the left, and bringing out her dress at the front.  Probably no fresh posing for the artist was necessary.  Her daughter, [[Anne of Austria]], Queen of France, was herself painted when 8 months pregnant with the future [[Louis XIV of France]], born 23 years into her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;However, they had both been 14 at the marriage, which was probably not consummated for some time.&lt;/ref&gt;  The portrait of their unfortunate cousin, Holy Roman Empress [[Maria Leopoldine of Austria]], who died in childbirth at 16 in 1649, the year the portrait is dated, is perhaps a posthumous adaptation of her wedding portrait.

Later portraits of pregnant women tended to be family members or at least friends of the artists; relatively few women, or their husbands, chose to commission expensive portraits (often only done once in a lifetime) showing them pregnant, although many women spent most of at least the early years of their married life pregnant.  The most common moment for a woman to have her portrait painted was just after her marriage, when any suggestion of pregnancy would be unwanted.  In some well-documented cases, the subjects of portraits can be shown to be well into pregnancy when the portrait was painted, but this is "suppressed" or "concealed" in the image.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 750("suppressed"); Hearn, 39 ("concealed")&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a relatively simple matter for a portraitist to remove or add a pregnant belly to a painting.  Several of the paintings (which are not portraits, though no doubt models from his circle were used) of [[Vermeer]] have been said to show pregnant women, but specialists mostly discount this.  One specialist was not aware of any portrait showing a pregnant woman from the whole of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 39, citing Marieke de Winkel.  Klepp, 138, says the same of 18th-century British America&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to 16th-century styles, "the fashion that had developed by the 1620s was especially helpful for a person trying to hide a swelling belly", even if only in a portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Luthman, Johanna, ''Love, Madness, and Scandal: The Life of Frances Coke Villiers, Viscountess Purbeck'', 76, 2017, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0198754655}}, 9780198754657, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WeE-DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 a portrait of his wife by [[Lovis Corinth]], dated five days before the birth, shows a profile view that emphasizes the pregnancy.  The prolific Corinth painted several pregnant women, many apparently not portraits.  [[Paula Modersohn-Becker]] painted herself as pregnant in 1906 before she had ever been so; in the following 18 months she had a daughter, dying three weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 750&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moralizing genre or satire===
[[File:William Hogarth 009.jpg|thumb|[[William Hogarth]], ''A Woman Swearing a Child to a Grave Citizen'' c.1729]]
Some [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] depictions in [[genre painting]], or other media such as [[popular print]]s or book illustrations, addressed the social implications of pregnancy, either showing women who were seen as having more children than they could afford, or women, especially maids, who had become pregnant outside marriage, with dire social implications for them.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 750–752&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of narrative scenes which show unwanted pregnancies essentially from the father's point of view, including some where the woman has brought the matter before local magistrates to award financial support, as unmarried women were able to do in England (uniquely, according to [[Bernard Picart]], who poured scorn on the law).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.genguide.co.uk/source/bastardy-bonds-amp-documents-parish-amp-poor-law/140/ Bastardy Bonds &amp; Documents (Parish &amp; Poor Law)]; for Picart's comments, see [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1M9CAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA253 pp. 254–256]&lt;/ref&gt;  The English artist [[William Hogarth]] included many pregnant women in his works, usually with a satirical or comic intention, and generally more often giving a negative implication than a positive one.&lt;ref&gt;Klepp, 132–138; [http://english231ballads2014w.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/71584958/Mitchell.pdf Mitchell, PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Hogarth's ''A Woman Swearing a Child to a Grave Citizen'' (or ''The Denunciation'', c.1729, [[National Gallery of Ireland]]) a young woman falsely accuses a rich old man of fathering her child, while the real father advises her.  The verses on the print version summarize the situation:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3560226&amp;partId=1&amp;people=33462&amp;peoA=33462-1-7&amp;page=2 British Museum page on a print version].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Here pregnant Madam screens the real Sire,/And falsly swears her Bastard Child for Hire/Upon a Rich old Letcher, who denies/The Fact, and vows the naughty Hussif lies;/His Wife enrag'd, exclaims against her Spouse,/And swears she'l be reveng'd upon his Brows;/The Jade, the Justice and Church Ward'ns agree,/And force him to provide Security.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In particular Hogarth depicted a number of pregnant ballad-sellers, and ones with young children.  Since the job required little movement, it was perhaps often taken during pregnancy, but Hogarth seems to have reflected a set of contemporary ideas using pregnancy as a metaphor for printing as a means of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[File:Gustav Klimt - Hope, II - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''Hoffnung II'' ("[[Hope II]]"), [[Gustav Klimt]], 1907-08]]
As the modern era approached, some artists began to show pregnancy more explicitly, with heavily pregnant figures, and more pregnant nudes than before.  Two paintings (not portraits as such) by [[Gustav Klimt]], ''[[Hope I]]'' (1903) and ''[[Hope II]]''  (1907–08), show slim, heavily pregnant women in profile. In ''Hope I'' the figure is nude, and the pregnancy very evident,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 749&lt;/ref&gt; while in ''Hope II'' a huge and elaborate dress or cloak makes this less immediately clear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79792 MOMA, New York, Note on Klimt's ''Hope II'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egon Schiele]] made pregnant nudes the subject of many of his drawings with colour, favouring a frontal view.  ''The Pregnant Woman'' by [[Pablo Picasso]] was a [[sculpture]] dedicated to his then partner Francoise Gilot and was made out of [[plaster]], [[armature (sculpture)|metal armature]], [[wood]], [[ceramic art|ceramic vessels]] and [[jars]]. Picasso wanted to inspire Gilot to have a third child with him by making this sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/artwork/pablo-picasso-pregnant-woman-la-femme-enceinte|title=Pablo Picasso – Pregnant Woman (Femme Enceinte)|publisher=artsy.net|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pregnant woman'' was the most famous painting in a series of paintings of seven pregnant [[nude women]] painted by [[Alice Neel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jul/07/alice-neel|title=The weird world of Alice Neel|work=The Guardian|date=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Pregnant girl'' was a painting of 1960–61 by [[Lucian Freud]] that portrayed his then girlfriend Bernadine Coverley, when she was pregnant with their daughter Bella.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.khm.at/fileadmin/content/KHM/Presse/2013/Freud_Neu/KHM_Freud_booklet_ENG.pdf Lucian Freud exhibition], No. 10, Press release/exhibition booklet, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien]], Vienna, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been nude sculptures of heavily pregnant women by, among others, [[Damien Hirst]], with ''The Virgin Mother'' (now at [[Lever House]] in New York)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leverhouseartcollection.com/collectionsexhibitions/collection/virgin-mother ''The Virgin Mother'' Lever House Art Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Verity (statue)|Verity]]'', 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Medical illustration==
[[File:Brussels Koninklijke Bibliotheek van Belgie, Bibliothèque royale de Belgique ms. 3701-15 57.jpg|thumb|left|Page from the earliest manuscript of [[Muscio]] on midwifery, 9–11th century]] 
In contrast to the general rarity of artistic depictions of pregnancy, in the field of medical illustration it has been one of the earliest and commonest subjects, with the same "[[cutaway drawing]]" approach found in some medieval religious works typically used.  The foetus is generally the main focus of interest, rather than the mother.  Most early depictions used in manuals on midwifery were very inaccurate, but still useful for showing the positions for delivery in [[childbirth]].  They were based on the re-copying over many generations of images from medical texts going back to [[Soranus of Ephesus]] in antiquity and [[Muscio]] in about 500.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 747–748&lt;/ref&gt;

The accurate drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] may have been the first to be made, but professional medical texts took centuries to catch up.  The Scottish anatomist [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]], doctor to [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]], was an admirer of Leonardo's drawings in the [[Royal Collection]] and learnt from their clear depictions.  His own work, ''The Anatomy of the Gravid Uterus Exhibited in Figures'', was published in 1774 and based on extensive study of late pregnant corpses;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 748; Wells, ''The Heart of Leonardo'', 249, 2014, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, {{ISBN|1447145313}}, 9781447145318, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tuq5BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; how he obtained so many was the subject of suspicion at the time and subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/feb/07/british-obstetrics-founders-murders-claim Founders of British obstetrics 'were callous murderers'], Denis Campbell, 7 February 1997, ''The Observer'', accessed April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art for pregnant women==
[[File:Bartolomeo Di Fruosino - Desco da parto (verso) - WGA01342.jpg|thumb|[[Bartolomeo di Fruosino]], 1420, a typical ''[[desco da parto]]'' (verso) with heraldry and a baby boy, to encourage positive thoughts during pregnancy, and even the birth of such a child.]]

Some kinds of art have been designed with pregnant women especially in mind, though these are perhaps less common than art intended for women wanting to become pregnant (discussed in art history using the term "[[fertility in art|fertility]]").  One of the many contexts and uses speculated for [[Venus figurine]]s is that they were held in the hand during childbirth, for which their rather consistent size and shape seems well suited. However, there are a variety of other explanations.&lt;ref&gt;Vandewettering, Kaylea R. (2015) "Upper Paleolithic Venus Figurines and Interpretations of Prehistoric Gender Representations", ''PURE Insights'': Vol. 4, Article 7, [http://digitalcommons.wou.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1051&amp;context=pure free online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Madonna del Parto]] and other images of the pregnant Virgin Mary were often mainly designed to offer a focus for the devotions of pregnant women and those concerned for them. In 1954 the mayor of [[Monterchi]], home of the [[Piero della Francesca]] ''Madonna'', refused to lend it to an exhibition in Florence so as not to deprive the population of its benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrie&lt;/ref&gt;

The painted ''[[desco da parto]]'' ("birth tray" or "birth salver") was an important symbolic gift for married women in late medieval and [[Early Modern]] [[Florence]] and [[Siena]].  Both sides were typically painted, but with different types of scenes.  The upper side (or [[recto]]) generally had a crowded figure scene, usually secular, such as a scene from [[classical myth]] or a suitable [[allegory]].  Scenes from the [[Old Testament]] or the Christian religious repertoire also appear in some cases.  Birthing scenes were popular.&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A; Musacchio, Jacqueline Marie, "The Medici-Tornabuoni Desco da Parto in Context", ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'' '''33''' (1998:137–151)&lt;/ref&gt;

The underside or [[verso]] generally has a simpler and often less elevated subject, with fewer, larger figures, and usually includes [[heraldry]], with the arms of both parents shown.&lt;ref&gt;The Medici-Tornabuoni tray is painted with the feather device of [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]] and the coats of arms of the Medici and Tornabuoni families.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scenes with one or two naked boy toddlers, with the [[coats of arms]] of both parents at the sides, are especially popular.

In the Renaissance it was believed that the sights a pregnant woman saw affected her pregnancy and even what it produced – [[Martin Luther]] told the cautionary story of a woman frightened by a mouse in pregnancy, who then gave birth to a mouse. Manuals advised keeping images with a positive impact in the sight of pregnant women, and it is in this context that the recurrent naked boys, and the scenes showing the end of a successful childbirth, should be seen.  This was also a factor in the display of images of the [[Virgin and Child]], which were ubiquitous in bedrooms. Probably the desci were hung with the verso displayed during pregnancy, to promote the production of a similar healthy boy.&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''remix service''' is a service (company or organization) that provides [[remix]]ed music to [[disc jockey]]s.

==History==
In the United States, the [[disco]] craze of the late 1970s led to the release of extended "disco" versions of songs, most of which were released on [[12-inch single|12" vinyl singles]]. Many of these were not easily [[Beatmixing|beatmixed]], so DJs started to laboriously edit songs by splicing [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] tape copies, making their own, unique versions that were better structured for a dancefloor.

1977 saw the creation of the first remix service, Disconet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.djsportal.com/en/pioneer/index.php?id=disconet| title=Disconet Story| work=DjsPortal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These companies gathered DJs and producers together to create monthly, promotional-only compilation albums containing re-edits, remixes, or [[List of musical medleys|medleys]] that were intended specifically for club DJs.

By 1994, there was a saturation of remix services, most of which typically remixed the same tracks as their competitor. At that point, the RIAA got involved and began notifying remix services that they needed to have clear permission from publishers or face litigation. Coincidentally, the services that survived the fallout (Ultimix, X-mix, Hot Tracks, Wicked Mix) all featured remixers that currently had radio mix-shows. In exchange for allowing remixing of certain tracks, remixers could be counted on by the labels to help "break" the new song they were trying to promote by featuring the track heavily in their mix-show.

While some services decided to ultimately cease operations, mixes began to pop up at most DJ record shops. It should be noted that an effort was made by one of the larger services to clear a way for all services to become legal. The idea was for every service to pay either a flat fee or a percentage of sales to a commission who would then allocate the money to the publishers whose tracks were used. This idea was rebuffed by the labels.

==Modern mixes==
Over the years, the remixes featured on these compilations have varied from simple edits, adding a mixable intro and outro to a song, or full-fledged, digital, multi-track remixes that barely resemble the original track. Many remix services have focused on a specific style of music (such as [[hip-hop]] or [[rock (music)|rock]]) or type of remix (such as [[house music|house]] mixes of pop hits).

As of 2006, there have been over 50 official remix services worldwide with at least as many spinoffs, although most of these companies (including Disconet) have long since folded due to financial or legal reasons. All remix services are required to get the original [[record label]] or artists' permission to edit and release a track, but many bootleg services exist that do not.

==Distribution==
Most of these companies required a DJ subscription agreement to buy the records or CDs, and each issue was typically limited in quantity from 100 to several thousand. Many of these compilations have become sought after collectors items as a result. Once in a while a remix service version of a song is released commercially by the artist's record label, but 99% of remix service mixes are sold only to DJs on the compilations.

==Notable companies==
Some of these companies helped launch the careers of many well-known remixers/producers.

[[Chris Cox (DJ)|Chris Cox]] (formerly of [[Thunderpuss]]) worked for [[Hot Tracks (remix service)|Hot Tracks]] (now Select Mix). [[Armand Van Helden]] created mixes for Mega-Mixx and X-Mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xmix.com| title=XMix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Markus Schulz]], [[C. L. McSpadden]] and [[Aaron Scofield|Aaron "The Pimp" Scofield]] made mixes for Powerhouse - after the company folded Scofield and McSpadden offered remixes through Culture Shock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myspace.com/cultureshockremix| title=About Culture Shock| work=CultureShockRemix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Schulz releases remixes and original compositions through his own Coldharbour Recordings label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.markusschulz.com| title=MarkusSchulz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Liebrand]] released numerous remixes with DMC. A few companies/artists besides Schulz have also developed their own commercial record labels to release new tracks.

The UK-based DMC remix service probably has the most members in the world, with offices in nearly every country, and that they sponsor the yearly World DJ Championships as well as releasing many commercial compilations.

Some of the better known remix services (all US-based unless stated):

==Megamixes==
Many remix services issues also contain [[megamix]]es. A megamix contains multiple songs mixed together, sometimes in rapid succession. They can consist of a single artist (just [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] songs, etc.) or multiple artists. Some may follow a theme as well (Christmas, only songs that have "queen" in the title, only [[David Morales (Disc Jockey)|David Morales]] mixes, etc.). Often megamixes are also called medleys.

Megamixes are also commonly found on commercial releases, sometimes using the same mix previously released to DJs on a remix service. The earlier [[Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers|Jive Bunny &amp; The Mastermixers]] series of 50s and 60s megamixes were originally released on the [[Music Factory]] Mastermix service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mastermixdj.com/paris/frameset.asp|title=MasterMix.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617185030/http://www.mastermixdj.com/paris/frameset.asp|archivedate=2008-06-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among modern services, Ultimix is well known for producing several megamixes every year based on popular songs of the year ("flashback medleys") as well as some single artist megamixes. Culture Shock has the "Hit "AC" Megamixes" on their main series derived from their now defunct [[Radio programming|radio show]], as well as a satellite series entitled "Use Alternative Routes" which contains [[Modern rock|Modern Rock]] megamixes. Similarly, the UK-based DMC and Music Factory Mastermix remix services frequently include megamixes on their issues.

{{Literature}}
A '''rhapsode''' ({{lang-el|ῥαψῳδός, "rhapsōidos"}}) or, in modern usage, '''rhapsodist''', refers to a [[classical Greece|classical Greek]] professional performer of [[epic poetry]]&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Rhapsodist |volume=23 |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the fifth and fourth centuries BC (and perhaps earlier). Rhapsodes notably performed the epics of [[Homer]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'') but also the [[Wisdom literature|wisdom]] and catalogue poetry of [[Hesiod]] and the [[satires]] of [[Archilochus]] and others. [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', in which [[Socrates]] confronts a star player rhapsode, remains the most coherent source of information on these artists. Often, rhapsodes are depicted in [[Ancient Greek art|Greek art]], wearing their signature cloak and carrying a staff. This equipment is also characteristic of travellers in general, implying that rhapsodes were itinerant performers, moving from town to town. Rhapsodes originated in the Ionian district, which has been sometimes regarded as [[Homer]]'s birthplace, and were also known as Homeridai, disciples of Homer, or "singers of stitched lays."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Oral Interpretation|author1=Bahn, E.  |author2=Bahn, M.L. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = Burgess|year = 1970|isbn = |location = Minneapolis, MN|pages = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
Today we think of rhapsode as a way of taking prose and amplifying it until it reaches levels of expectation that few can understand, so in reality rhapsode is the ultimate form of prose, poem and literature and even the most talented of writers dont' usually understand that rhapsode is an art form in itself to be mastered, controlled and shared. Rhapsode is like a sympathy of instruments that is perfectly played to precision with an ultimate goal in mind. For example, here is prose that would be considered to be rhapsode.

::''The child broke down when she finally understood that she was an intellectual even though all those around her chastised her, hurt her to the point of death a multitude of times but through the years she finally understood she was rhapsode, because she was not only their superior, but she was humble, kind, forgiving and most of all a symphony of instruments that were playing in perfect harmony that no one else could hear but her, and this was her torment. While she knew what was true and right, all those around her continued harm her in the most evil of ways, and finally she broke down and no longer contributed to the good of mankind, but instead became a recluse who could have cured the most horrible diseases known to man, but instead she was too broken to contribute and so she stayed as recluse in her basement for all eternity. Her crime was letting evil control her, because evil is what man is, and control is how he empowers himself, and if one of us lets this steal their heart, then they are the ones to blame, but they cannot blame the evil because blame is weakness. The child learn early to be strong and that evil is as evil does and evil will always exist, but we all have choice, and choices are something we can own no matter what our circumstances are, we always have a choice. When the child finally understood this she broke down and cried, but her tears meant nothing to her tormentors because they only wanted to bring out her evil, but she had none to show, and so she won, and they became her victims and the broken child finally understood that she was an intellectual and no one else around her mattered because they were simply nothingness and no one but empty faces in the wind.''

The reason this is rhapsode is because there is moral, a tale and an ending that matters.
--&gt;

==Etymology and usage==
The term "rhapsode" is derived from ''rhapsōidein'' (ῥαψῳδεῖν), meaning "to sew songs [together]".&lt;ref&gt;Ridderstrøm, H. (2006). ''Tekstsamling I: litteraturhistorie: Litteraturhistoriske tekstpraksiser''. Oslo: Høgskolen i Oslo&lt;/ref&gt; This word illustrates how the oral epic poet, or ''rhapsode'', would build a repertoire of diverse myths, tales and jokes to include in the content of the epic poem. Thus it was possible, through experience and improvisatory skills, for him to shift the content of the [[epic poetry|epos]] according to the preferred taste of a specific location's audience. However, the outer framework of the epic would remain virtually the same in every "singing", thus securing the projection of underlying themes such as of morality or honour. The performance of epic poetry was called in classical Greek ''rhapsōidia'' (ῥαψῳδία), and its performer ''rhapsōidos''. The word does not occur in the early epics, which use the word '''''[[aoidos]]''''' (ἀοιδός "singer") for performers in all genres including this one. It is unknown whether Hesiod and the poet(s) of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' would have recognised and accepted the name of rhapsode; it has been argued by Walter Burkert, and is accepted by some recent scholars, that ''rhapsōidos'' was by definition a performer of a fixed, written text.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{Citation | surname =Burkert | given=Walter | authorlink=Walter Burkert | chapter=The making of Homer in the 6th century BC: rhapsodes versus Stesichorus | title=Papers on the Amasis painter and his world | publisher=Getty Museum | place= Malibu | year=1987 | pages=43–62 }}; {{Citation | surname=Graziosi | given=Barbara | title=Inventing Homer: the early reception of epic | publisher=Cambridge University Press | place=Cambridge | year=2002 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''rhapsōidos'' was in use as early as [[Pindar]] (522–443 BC), who implies two different explanations of it, "singer of stitched verse", and "singer with the staff". Of these the first is etymologically correct; the second was suggested by the fact, for which there is early evidence, that the singer was accustomed to hold a staff (ῥάβδος ''rhabdos'') in his hand, perhaps, like the sceptre in the Homeric assembly, as a symbol of the right to a hearing or to "emphasize the rhythm or to give grandeur to their gestures".&lt;ref&gt;Bahn, Eugene, and Margaret L. Bahn. ''A History of Oral Interpretation.'' Minneapolis, MN: Burgess, 1979, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; The etymological meaning is interesting because it is an exact metaphor for what [[Oral poetry|oral narrative poets]] do: they stitch together formulas, lines and [[type-scene]]s in the course of performance. There are indications in Pindar and other authors that oral epic was still a living and popular tradition in the early fifth century;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | surname=Dalby | given=Andrew | authorlink=Andrew Dalby | title=[[Rediscovering Homer]] | publisher=Norton | place=New York, London | year=2006 | ISBN=0-393-05788-7 }}, pp. 157–168.&lt;/ref&gt; all the later evidence, however, is that rhapsodes worked from written texts, and in some cases were compelled by law to do so.

==Performance==
It is certain that rhapsodes performed competitively, contending for prizes at religious festivals, and that this practice was already well-established by the fifth century BC. The ''[[Iliad]]'' alludes to the myth of [[Thamyris]], the Thracian singer, who boasted that he could defeat even the Muses in song. He competed with them, was defeated, and was punished for his presumption with the loss of his ability to sing.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 2.594-600; see [[scholia]] on this passage and [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], ''Library'' 1.3.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the practice is first evident in Hesiod's claim that he performed a song at the funeral games for Amphidamas in Euboea and won a prize.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''[[Works and Days]]'' 650-662: see Hesiod, ''Theogony'' ed. [[M. L. West]] (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1966) pp. 43-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Competitive singing is depicted vividly in the ''[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Apollo]]'' and mentioned in the two ''Hymns to Aphrodite''.&lt;ref&gt;''Homeric Hymn to Apollo'' 165-173; ''Homeric Hymns'' 5 and 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter of these may evidently be taken to belong to [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]] in Cyprus and the festival of the Cyprian Aphrodite, in the same way that the ''Hymn to Apollo'' belongs to [[Delos]] and the Delian gathering.

An early historical mention of rhapsodes occurs in the ''Histories'' of [[Herodotus]] (c. 440 BC). He tells the story that at [[Sicyon]] the ruler [[Cleisthenes]] (600–560 BC) expelled the rhapsodes on account of the poems of Homer, because they promoted [[Argos]] and the [[Argives]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus 5.67.&lt;/ref&gt; This description applies very well to the ''[[Iliad]]'', in which "Argives" is one of the alternate names for the Greek warriors; it may have suited the ''[[Thebaid (Greek poem)|Thebaid]]'' still better, since Argos was named in the first line of that poem. The incident seems to show that poems performed by rhapsodes had political and propagandistic importance in the Peloponnese in the early sixth century BC.

At [[Athens]], by 330 BC, there was a law that rhapsodes should perform the Homeric poems at every [[Panathenaea|Panathenaic festival]]; this law is appealed to as glory of Athens by the orator [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]].&lt;ref&gt;Lycurgus, ''Against Leocrates'' 102. The ''Iliad'' was also recited at the festival of the Brauronia, at [[Brauron]] in Attica ([[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] s.v. ''Brauronia'').&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps therefore such a custom was exceptional, and we do not know when or by whom it was introduced, although the Platonic dialogue ''[[Hipparchus (dialogue)|Hipparchus]]'' (not really by Plato, but probably of the fourth century BC) attributes it to [[Hipparchus (son of Pisistratus)|Hipparchus, son of Peisistratos (Athens)]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hipparchus'' 228b8. This, however, may be merely part of the historical romance of the Pisistratids: it is telling that [[Herodotus]] (7.6), who knew about Hipparchus' literary activities, knows nothing about this. The author of the ''Hipparchus'' makes (perhaps wilfully) all the mistakes about the family of [[Pisistratus]] which [[Thucydides]] notices in a well-known passage (6.54-59).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hipparchus'' adds that the law required the rhapsodists to follow on from one another in order, "as they still do". This recurs in a different form in the much later statement of [[Diogenes Laertius]] (1.2.57) that [[Solon]] made a law that the poems should be recited "with prompting". Many Athenian laws were falsely attributed to early lawgivers, but it is at least clear that by the fourth century the Homeric poems were a compulsory part of the Panathenaea, and were to be recited in order. They are too long for a single rhapsode or for a single day's performance. Therefore, they had to be divided into parts, and each rhapsode had to take his assigned part (otherwise they would have chosen favourite or prize passages).

Complementary evidence on oral performance of poetry in classical Greece comes in the form of references to a family, clan, or professional association of ''[[Homeridae]]'' (literally "children of Homer"). These certainly had an existence in the fifth and fourth centuries BC and certainly performed poems attributed to [[Homer]]. [[Pindar]] seems to count the Homeridae as rhapsodes;&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Nemean Odes'' 2.1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; other sources do not specifically confirm this categorisation.

'''Roman Republican portraiture''' was practiced during the [[periodization|period]] of the [[Roman Republic]] (500–27 BC). Examples of [[Roman portraiture]], both sculpture and painting, are more abundant for the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]]. Republican portraiture is characterized by [[verism]] influenced by [[Hellenistic portraiture]], and survives mainly as marble and bronze sculpture. Roman portrait busts are thought to derive in part from death masks or funerary commemorations, as elite Romans displayed ancestral images ''([[Roman funerals and burial#Funerary art|imagines]])'' in the atrium of their home ''([[domus]])''.

'''Romanesque architecture'''  is an [[architectural style]] of [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] characterized by semi-circular [[arch]]es. There is no consensus for the beginning date of the Romanesque style, with proposals ranging from the 6th to the 11th century, this later date being the most commonly held. In the 12th century it developed into the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]], marked by pointed arches. Examples of Romanesque architecture can be found across the continent, making it the first pan-European architectural style since [[Roman architecture|Imperial Roman architecture]]. The Romanesque style in England is traditionally referred to as [[Norman architecture]].

Combining features of [[Ancient Roman architecture|ancient Roman]] and [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] buildings and other local traditions, Romanesque architecture is known by its massive quality, thick walls, round arches, sturdy [[Pier (architecture)|pillars]], [[barrel vault]]s, large towers and decorative [[Arcade (architecture)|arcading]]. Each building has clearly defined forms, frequently of very regular, [[symmetrical]] plan; the overall appearance is one of simplicity when compared with the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] buildings that were to follow. The style can be identified right across Europe, despite regional characteristics and different materials.

Many [[castle]]s were built during this period, but they are greatly outnumbered by churches. The most significant are the great [[abbey]] churches, many of which are still standing, more or less complete and frequently in use.&lt;ref name=BF&gt;Bannister Fletcher, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''.&lt;/ref&gt; The enormous quantity of churches built in the Romanesque period was succeeded by the still busier period of Gothic architecture, which partly or entirely rebuilt most Romanesque churches in prosperous areas like England and Portugal. The largest groups of Romanesque survivors are in areas that were less prosperous in subsequent periods, including parts of [[southern France]], rural Spain and rural Italy. Survivals of unfortified [[Romanesque secular and domestic architecture|Romanesque secular]] houses and palaces, and the domestic quarters of monasteries are far rarer, but these used and adapted the features found in church buildings, on a domestic scale.

==Definition==
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word "Romanesque" means "descended from Roman" and was first used in English to designate what are now called [[Romance languages]] (first cited 1715). The French term "{{lang|fr|romane}}" was first used in the architectural sense by archaeologist [[Charles-Alexis-Adrien Duhérissier de Gerville|Charles de Gerville]] in a letter of 18 December 1818 to [[Auguste Le Prévost]] to describe what Gerville sees as a ''debased Roman architecture''.{{#tag:ref|Gerville (1818): {{lang-fr|Je vous ai quelquefois parlé d'architecture romane. C’est un mot de ma façon qui me paraît heureusement inventé pour remplacer les mots insignifiants de saxone et de normande. Tout le monde convient que cette architecture, lourde et grossière, est l'opus romanum dénaturé ou successivement dégradé par nos rudes ancêtres. Alors aussi, de la langue latine, également estropiée, se faisait cette langue romane dont l'origine et la dégradation ont tant d'analogie avec l'origine et les progrès de l'architecture. Dites-moi donc, je vous prie, que mon nom romane est heureusement trouvé.}} (I have sometimes spoken to you about Romanesque architecture.

{{See also|Romanesque secular and domestic architecture}}
Buildings of every type were constructed in the Romanesque style, with evidence remaining of simple domestic buildings, elegant town houses, grand palaces, commercial premises, civic buildings, castles, city walls, bridges, village churches, abbey churches, abbey complexes and large cathedrals.&lt;ref name=Romanesque&gt;Rolf Toman, ''Romanesque: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting''&lt;/ref&gt; Of these types of buildings, domestic and commercial buildings are the most rare, with only a handful of survivors in the United Kingdom, several clusters in France, isolated buildings across Europe and by far the largest number, often unidentified and altered over the centuries, in Italy. Many castles exist, the foundations of which date from the Romanesque period. Most have been substantially altered, and many are in ruins.

By far the greatest number of surviving Romanesque buildings are churches. These range from tiny [[chapel]]s to large [[cathedral]]s. Although many have been extended and altered in different styles, a large number remain either substantially intact or sympathetically restored, demonstrating the form, character and decoration of Romanesque church architecture.&lt;ref name=Romanesque/&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Pre-Romanesque art and architecture}}

===Origins===
Romanesque architecture was the first distinctive style to spread across Europe since the [[Roman Empire]]. With the decline of Rome, [[Roman architecture|Roman building methods]] survived to an extent in Western Europe, where successive [[Merovingian art and architecture|Merovingian]], [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian]] architects continued to build large stone buildings such as monastery churches and palaces. In the more northern countries, Roman building styles and techniques had never been adopted except for official buildings, while in Scandinavia they were unknown. Although the round arch continued in use, the engineering skills required to vault large spaces and build large domes were lost. There was a loss of stylistic continuity, particularly apparent in the decline of the formal vocabulary of the [[Architectural orders|Classical Orders]]. In Rome several great [[Constantine I|Constantinian]] [[basilica]]s continued in use as an inspiration to later builders. Some traditions of Roman architecture also survived in [[Byzantine architecture]] with the 6th-century octagonal Byzantine [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]] being the inspiration for the greatest building of the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] in Europe, the [[Emperor Charlemagne]]'s [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen]], Germany, built around the year AD 800.&lt;ref name=HG&gt;Helen Gardner, ''Art through the Ages''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dating shortly after the Palatine Chapel is a remarkable 9th-century Swiss manuscript known as the [[Plan of Saint Gall]] and showing a very detailed plan of a monastic complex, with all its various monastic buildings and their functions labelled. The largest building is the church, the plan of which is distinctly Germanic, having an apse at both ends, an arrangement not generally seen elsewhere. Another feature of the church is its regular proportion, the square plan of the crossing tower providing a module for the rest of the plan. These features can both be seen at the Proto-Romanesque [[St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim]], 1001–1030.&lt;ref name=HG/&gt;

Architecture of a Romanesque style also developed simultaneously in the north of Italy, parts of France and in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the 10th century and prior to the later influence of the [[Abbey of Cluny]]. The style, sometimes called [[First Romanesque]] or [[Lombard architecture|Lombard Romanesque]], is characterised by thick walls, lack of sculpture and the presence of rhythmic ornamental arches known as a [[Lombard band]].

===Politics===
[[Charlemagne]] was crowned by the Pope in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] on Christmas Day in the year 800, with an aim to re-establishing the old [[Roman Empire]]. Charlemagne's political successors continued to rule much of Europe, with a gradual emergence of the separate political states that were eventually to become welded into nations, either by allegiance or defeat, the [[Kingdom of Germany]] giving rise to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The invasion of England by [[William, Duke of Normandy]], in 1066, saw the building of both castles and churches that reinforced the Norman presence. Several significant churches that were built at this time were founded by rulers as seats of temporal and religious power, or places of [[coronation]] and burial. These include the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbaye-Saint-Denis]], [[Speyer Cathedral]] and [[Westminster Abbey]] (where little of the Norman church now remains).

At a time when the remaining architectural structures of the [[Roman Empire]] were falling into decay and much of its learning and technology lost, the building of masonry domes and the carving of decorative architectural details continued unabated, though greatly evolved in style since the fall of Rome, in the enduring [[Byzantine Empire]]. The domed churches of [[Constantinople]] and Eastern Europe were to greatly affect the architecture of certain towns, particularly through trade and through the [[Crusades]]. The most notable single building that demonstrates this is [[St Mark's Basilica]], [[Venice]], but there are many lesser-known examples, particularly in France, such as the church of [[Périgueux Cathedral|Saint-Front]], [[Périgueux]] and [[Angoulême Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=OME&gt;George Holmes, ed. ''The Oxford History of Medieval Europe''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Europe was affected by [[feudalism]] in which peasants held tenure from local rulers over the land that they farmed in exchange for [[military service]]. The result of this was that they could be called upon, not only for local and regional spats, but to follow their lord to travel across Europe to the Crusades, if they were required to do so. The [[Crusades]], 1095–1270, brought about a very large movement of people and, with them, ideas and trade skills, particularly those involved in the building of fortifications and the metal working needed for the provision of arms, which was also applied to the fitting and decoration of buildings. The continual movement of people, rulers, nobles, bishops, abbots, craftsmen and peasants, was an important factor in creating a homogeneity in building methods and a recognizable ''Romanesque style'', despite regional differences.

Life became generally less secure after the Carolingian period. This resulted in the building of castles at strategic points, many of them being constructed as strongholds of the Normans, descendants of the Vikings who invaded northern France under [[Rollo]] in 911. Political struggles also resulted in the fortification of many towns, or the rebuilding and strengthening of walls that remained from the Roman period. One of the most notable surviving fortifications is that of the city of [[Carcassonne]]. The enclosure of towns brought about a lack of living space within the walls, and resulted in a style of town house that was tall and narrow, often surrounding communal courtyards, as at [[San Gimignano]] in [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref name=Toman1&gt;Rolf Toman, pp. 114-117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copplestone, pp.188-89&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s built a number of residences, fortified, but essentially palaces rather than castles, at strategic points and on trade routes. The [[Imperial Palace of Goslar]] (heavily restored in the 19th century) was built in the early 11th century by Otto III and Henry III, while the ruined Palace at [[Gelnhausen]] was received by Frederick Barbarossa prior to 1170.&lt;ref name=Toman2&gt;Rolf Toman, pp. 70-73&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of people and armies also brought about the building of bridges, some of which have survived, including the 12th-century bridge at [[Besalú]], [[Catalonia]], the 11th-century Puente de la Reina, [[Navarre]] and the Pont-Saint-Bénézet, [[Avignon]].&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Toman, pp. 18, 177, 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Across Europe, the late 11th and 12th centuries saw an unprecedented growth in the number of churches.&lt;ref&gt;"In the years that followed the year 1000, we witnessed the rebuilding of churches all over the universe, but especially in Italy and Gaul." Chronicle of Raoul Glaber, quoted by Jean Hubert, ''Romanesque Art''.&lt;/ref&gt; A great number of these buildings, both large and small, remain, some almost intact and in others altered almost beyond recognition in later centuries. They include many very well known churches such as [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]] in Rome,&lt;ref&gt;famous for the ancient Roman "Mouth of Truth" set into the wall of its narthex&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Florence Baptistry|Baptistery in Florence]]&lt;ref&gt;famous for the 15th-century Ghiberti Doors&lt;/ref&gt; and San Zeno Maggiore in Verona.&lt;ref&gt;traditionally the marriage place of [[Romeo and Juliet]]&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the famous abbeys of Aux Dames and Les Hommes at Caen and [[Mont Saint-Michel]] date from this period, as well as the abbeys of the pilgrimage route to [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|Santiago de Compostela]]. Many cathedrals owe their foundation to this date, with others beginning as abbey churches, and later becoming cathedrals. In England, of the cathedrals of ancient foundation, all were begun in this period with the exception of Salisbury, where the monks relocated from the Norman church at [[Old Sarum]], and several, such as [[Canterbury]], which were rebuilt on the site of Saxon churches.&lt;ref name=JH&gt;John Harvey, ''English Cathedrals''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ACT&gt;Alec Clifton-Taylor, ''The Cathedrals of England''&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, the most famous church of the period is [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|Santiago de Compostela]]. In Germany, the Rhine and its tributaries were the location of many Romanesque abbeys, notably [[Mainz Cathedral|Mainz]], [[Worms Cathedral|Worms]], [[Speyer Cathedral|Speyer]] and [[Bamberg Cathedral|Bamberg]]. In [[Cologne]], then the largest city north of the Alps, a very important [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|group of large city churches]] survives largely intact. As monasticism spread across Europe, Romanesque churches sprang up in Scotland, Scandinavia, Poland, Hungary, Sicily, Serbia and Tunisia. Several important Romanesque churches were built in the [[Crusader kingdom]]s.&lt;ref name=Toman&gt;Rolf Toman, ''Romanesque''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Monasticism====
The system of monasticism in which the religious become members of an order, with common ties and a common rule, living in a mutually dependent community, rather than as a group of hermits living in proximity but essentially separate, was established by the monk [[Benedict of Nursia|Benedict]] in the 6th century. The [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] monasteries spread from Italy throughout Europe, being always by far the most numerous in England. They were followed by the [[Cluniacs|Cluniac]] order, the [[Cistercians]], [[Carthusian]]s and [[Augustinian Canons]]. During the [[Crusades]], the military orders of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and the [[Knights Templar]] were founded.

The monasteries, which sometimes also functioned as cathedrals, and the cathedrals that had bodies of secular clergy often living in community, were a major source of power in Europe. Bishops and the abbots of important monasteries lived and functioned like princes. The monasteries were the major seats of learning of all sorts. Benedict had ordered that all the arts were to be taught and practiced in the monasteries. Within the monasteries books were transcribed by hand, and few people outside the monasteries could read or write.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;

In France, Burgundy was the centre of monasticism. The enormous and powerful monastery at [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] was to have lasting effect on the layout of other monasteries and the design of their churches. Unfortunately, very little of the abbey church at Cluny remains; the "Cluny II" rebuilding of 963 onwards has completely vanished, but we have a good idea of the design of "Cluny III" from 1088 to 1130, which until the Renaissance remained the largest building in Europe. However, the church of [[Basilica of St. Sernin, Toulouse|St. Sernin]] at [[Toulouse]], 1080–1120, has remained intact and demonstrates the regularity of Romanesque design with its modular form, its massive appearance and the repetition of the simple arched window motif.&lt;ref name=HG/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Pilgrimage and Crusade====
One of the effects of the [[Crusades]], which were intended to wrest the Holy Places of Palestine from [[Islam]]ic control, was to excite a great deal of religious fervour, which in turn inspired great building programs. The Nobility of Europe, upon safe return, thanked [[God]] by the building of a new church or the enhancement of an old one. Likewise, those who did not return from the Crusades could be suitably commemorated by their family in a work of stone and mortar.

The Crusades resulted in the transfer of, among other things, a great number of [[Relic|Holy Relics]] of [[saint]]s and [[apostles]]. Many churches, like [[Périgueux|Saint-Front, Périgueux]], had their own home grown saint while others, most notably [[Santiago de Compostela]], claimed the remains and the patronage of a powerful saint, in this case one of the [[Twelve Apostles]]. [[Santiago de Compostela]], located near [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (present day Spain) became one of the most important pilgrimage destinations in Europe. Most of the pilgrims travelled the [[Way of St. James]] on foot, many of them barefooted as a sign of penance. They moved along one of the four main routes that passed through France, congregating for the journey at [[Jumièges]], Paris, [[Vézelay]], [[Cluny]], [[Arles]] and [[St. Gall]] in Switzerland. They crossed two passes in the [[Pyrenees]] and converged into a single stream to traverse north-western Spain. Along the route they were urged on by those pilgrims returning from the journey. On each of the routes abbeys such as those at [[Moissac]], [[Toulouse]], [[Roncesvalles]], [[Conques]], [[Limoges]] and [[Burgos]] catered for the flow of people and grew wealthy from the passing trade. [[Saint-Benoît-du-Sault]], in the Berry province, is typical of the churches that were founded on the pilgrim route.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref Name=HG/&gt;

==Characteristics==
{{See also|List of regional characteristics of Romanesque churches}}
The general impression given by Romanesque architecture, in both ecclesiastical and secular buildings, is one of massive solidity and strength. In contrast with both the preceding [[Roman architecture|Roman]] and later [[Gothic architecture]], in which the load-bearing structural members are, or appear to be, columns, pilasters and arches, Romanesque architecture, in common with [[Byzantine architecture]], relies upon its walls, or sections of walls called piers.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

Romanesque architecture is often divided into two periods known as the "[[First Romanesque]]" style and the "Romanesque" style. The difference is chiefly a matter of the expertise with which the buildings were constructed. The First Romanesque employed rubble walls, smaller windows and unvaulted roofs. A greater refinement marks the Second Romanesque, along with increased use of the vault and dressed stone.

===Walls===
The walls of Romanesque buildings are often of massive thickness with few and comparatively small openings. They are often double shells, filled with rubble.

The building material differs greatly across Europe, depending upon the local stone and building traditions. In Italy, Poland, much of Germany and parts of the Netherlands, brick is generally used. Other areas saw extensive use of limestone, granite and flint. The building stone was often used in comparatively small and irregular pieces, bedded in thick mortar. Smooth [[ashlar]] masonry was not a distinguishing feature of the style, particularly in the earlier part of the period, but occurred chiefly where easily worked limestone was available.&lt;ref name=RH&gt;Rene Hyughe, ''Larousse Encyclopedia of Byzantine and Medieval Art&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buttresses===
Because of the massive nature of Romanesque walls, [[buttress]]es are not a highly significant feature, as they are in Gothic architecture. Romanesque buttresses are generally of flat square profile and do not project a great deal beyond the wall. In the case of aisled churches, barrel vaults, or half-barrel vaults over the aisles helped to buttress the nave, if it was vaulted.

In the cases where half-barrel vaults were used, they effectively became like [[flying buttress]]es. Often aisles extended through two storeys, rather than the one usual in Gothic architecture, so as to better support the weight of a vaulted nave. In the case of Durham Cathedral, flying buttresses have been employed, but are hidden inside the triforium gallery.&lt;ref name=ACT/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Arches and openings===
The arches used in Romanesque architecture are nearly always semicircular, for openings such as doors and windows, for [[vault (architecture)|vaults]] and for arcades. Wide doorways are usually surmounted by a semi-circular arch, except where a door with a [[Lintel (architecture)|lintel]] is set into a large arched recess and surmounted by a semi-circular "lunette" with decorative carving.&lt;ref name=HG/&gt; These doors sometimes have a carved central jamb.

Narrow doors and small windows might be surmounted by a solid stone lintel. Larger openings are nearly always arched. A characteristic feature of Romanesque architecture, both ecclesiastic and domestic, is the pairing of two arched windows or arcade openings, separated by a pillar or colonette and often set within a larger arch. Ocular windows are common in Italy, particularly in the facade gable and are also seen in Germany. Later Romanesque [[church architecture|churches]] may have wheel windows or [[rose window]]s with [[plate tracery]].

There are a very small number of buildings in the Romanesque style, such as [[Autun Cathedral]] in France and [[Monreale Cathedral]] in Sicily in which pointed arches have been used extensively, apparently for stylistic reasons. It is believed that in these cases there is a direct imitation of [[Islamic architecture]]. At other late Romanesque churches such as [[Durham Cathedral]], and [[Cefalù Cathedral]], the pointed arch was introduced as a structural device in ribbed vaulting. Its increasing application was fundamental to the development of [[Gothic architecture]].

===Arcades===
An arcade is a row of arches, supported on piers or columns. They occur in the interior of large churches, separating the nave from the aisles, and in large secular interiors spaces, such as the great hall of a castle, supporting the timbers of a roof or upper floor. Arcades also occur in cloisters and atriums, enclosing an open space.

Arcades can occur in storeys or stages. While the arcade of a cloister is typically of a single stage, the arcade that divides the nave and aisles in a church is typically of two stages, with a third stage of window openings known as the [[clerestory]] rising above them. Arcading on a large scale generally fulfils a structural purpose, but it is also used, generally on a smaller scale, as a decorative feature, both internally and externally where it is frequently "[[Blind arcade|blind arcading]]" with only a wall or a narrow passage behind it.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Piers===
In Romanesque architecture, [[Pier (architecture)|pier]]s were often employed to support arches. They were built of masonry and square or rectangular in section, generally having a horizontal moulding representing a capital at the springing of the arch. Sometimes piers have vertical shafts attached to them, and may also have horizontal mouldings at the level of the base.

Although basically rectangular, piers can often be of highly complex form, with half-segments of large hollow-core columns on the inner surface supporting the arch, or a clustered group of smaller shafts leading into the mouldings of the arch.

Piers that occur at the intersection of two large arches, such as those under the crossing of the nave and transept, are commonly cruciform in shape, each arch having its own supporting rectangular pier at right angles to the other.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=HG/&gt;

===Columns===
Columns are an important structural feature of Romanesque architecture. Colonnettes and attached shafts are also used structurally and for decoration. Monolithic columns cut from a single piece of stone were frequently used in Italy, as they had been in Roman and Early Christian architecture.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt; They were also used, particularly in Germany, when they alternated between more massive piers.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt; Arcades of columns cut from single pieces are also common in structures that do not bear massive weights of masonry, such as cloisters, where they are sometimes paired.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;

====Salvaged columns====
In Italy, during this period, a great number of antique Roman columns were salvaged and reused in the interiors and on the porticos of churches. The most durable of these columns are of marble and have the stone horizontally bedded. The majority are vertically bedded and are sometimes of a variety of colours. They may have retained their original Roman capitals, generally of the [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] or [[Composite order|Roman Composite]] style.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;
Some buildings, like [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]] &lt;small&gt;(illustrated above)&lt;/small&gt; and the atrium at [[Basilica di San Clemente|San Clemente]] in Rome, may have an odd assortment of columns in which large capitals are placed on short columns and small capitals are placed on taller columns to even the height. Architectural compromises of this type are seen where materials have been salvaged from a number of buildings. Salvaged columns were also used to a lesser extent in France.

====Drum columns====
In most parts of Europe, Romanesque columns were massive, as they supported thick upper walls with small windows, and sometimes heavy vaults. The most common method of construction was to build them out of stone cylinders called drums, as in the crypt at [[Speyer Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This technique was also used in the Classical world, notably at the [[Parthenon]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hollow core columns====
Where really massive columns were called for, such as those at [[Durham Cathedral]], they were constructed of ashlar masonry and the hollow core was filled with rubble. These huge untapered columns are sometimes ornamented with incised decorations.&lt;ref name=ACT/&gt;

====Alternation====
A common characteristic of Romanesque buildings, occurring both in churches and in the arcades that separate large interior spaces of castles, is the alternation of piers and columns.

The most simple form that this takes is to have a column between each adjoining pier. Sometimes the columns are in multiples of two or three. At [[St. Michael's, Hildesheim]], an A B B A alternation occurs in the nave while an A B A alternation can be seen in the transepts.

At [[Jumièges]] there are tall drum columns between piers each of which has a half-column supporting the arch. There are many variations on this theme, most notably at [[Durham Cathedral]] where the mouldings and shafts of the piers are of exceptional richness and the huge masonry columns are deeply incised with geometric patterns.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;

Often the arrangement was made more complex by the complexity of the piers themselves, so that it was not piers and columns that alternated, but rather, piers of entirely different form from each other, such as those of [[Sant' Ambrogio, Milan]], where the nature of the vault dictated that the alternate piers bore a great deal more weight than the intermediate ones and are thus very much larger.&lt;ref name=HG/&gt;

File:Durham.2.jpg|[[Durham Cathedral]], England, has decorated masonry columns alternating with piers of clustered shafts supporting the earliest pointed high ribs.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Capitals====
The foliate [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] style provided the inspiration for many Romanesque capitals, and the accuracy with which they were carved depended very much on the availability of original models, those in Italian churches such as [[Pisa Cathedral]] or church of [[Sant'Alessandro, Lucca|Sant'Alessandro in Lucca]] and southern France being much closer to the Classical than those in England.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;

The Corinthian capital is essentially round at the bottom where it sits on a circular column and square at the top, where it supports the wall or arch. This form of capital was maintained in the general proportions and outline of the Romanesque capital. This was achieved most simply by cutting a rectangular cube and taking the four lower corners off at an angle so that the block was square at the top, but octagonal at the bottom, as can be seen at St. Michael's Hildesheim.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;
This shape lent itself to a wide variety of superficial treatments, sometimes foliate in imitation of the source, but often figurative. In Northern Europe the foliate capitals generally bear far more resemblance to the intricacies of [[manuscript illumination]] than to Classical sources. In parts of France and Italy there are strong links to the pierced capitals of [[Byzantine architecture]]. It is in the figurative capitals that the greatest originality is shown. While some are dependent on manuscripts illustrations of Biblical scenes and depictions of beasts and monsters, others are lively scenes of the legends of local saints.&lt;ref name=OME/&gt;

The capitals, while retaining the form of a square top and a round bottom, were often compressed into little more than a bulging cushion-shape. This is particularly the case on large masonry columns, or on large columns that alternate with piers as at Durham.&lt;small&gt;(See illustrated above)&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Vaults and roofs===
The majority of buildings have wooden roofs, generally of a simple ''truss'', ''tie beam'' or ''king post'' form. In the case of trussed rafter roofs, they are sometimes lined with wooden ceilings in three sections like those that survive at [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]] and [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough]] cathedrals in England. In churches, typically the aisles are vaulted, but the nave is roofed with timber, as is the case at both Peterborough and Ely.&lt;ref name=ACT/&gt; In Italy where open wooden roofs are common, and tie beams frequently occur in conjunction with vaults, the timbers have often been decorated as at [[San Miniato al Monte]], Florence.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;

Vaults of stone or brick took on several different forms and showed marked development during the period, evolving into the pointed ribbed arch characteristic of [[Gothic architecture]].

====Barrel vault====
The simplest type of vaulted roof is the [[barrel vault]] in which a single arched surface extends from wall to wall, the length of the space to be vaulted, for example, the nave of a church. An important example, which retains Medieval paintings, is the vault of [[Abbey Church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe|Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe]], France, of the early 12th century. However, the barrel vault generally required the support of solid walls, or walls in which the windows were very small.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;

====Groin vault====
[[Groin vault]]s occur in early Romanesque buildings, notably at [[Speyer Cathedral]] where the high vault of about 1060 is the first employment in Romanesque architecture of this type of vault for a wide nave.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt; In later buildings employing ribbed vaultings, groin vaults are most frequently used for the less visible and smaller vaults, particularly in crypts and aisles. A groin vault is almost always square in plan and is constructed of two barrel vaults intersecting at right angles. Unlike a ribbed vault, the entire arch is a structural member. Groin vaults are frequently separated by transverse arched ribs of low profile as at Speyer and [[Santiago de Compostela]]. At [[Vézelay Abbey|Sainte Marie Madeleine, Vézelay]], the ribs are square in section, strongly projecting and polychrome.&lt;ref name=NP&gt;Nikolaus Pevsner, ''An Outline of European Architecture''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ribbed vault====
[[Ribbed vault]]s came into general use in the 12th century. In ribbed vaults, not only are there ribs spanning the vaulted area transversely, but each vaulted bay has diagonal ribs, following the same course as the groins in a groin vault. However, whereas in a groin vault, the vault itself is the structural member, in a ribbed vault, it is the ribs that are the structural members, and the spaces between them can be filled with lighter, non-structural material.&lt;ref name =BF307&gt;Banister Fletcher, p.307&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Romanesque arches are nearly always semi-circular, the structural and design problem inherent in the ribbed vault is that the diagonal span is larger and therefore higher than the transverse span.&lt;ref name=BF307/&gt; The Romanesque builders used a number of solutions to this problem. One was to have the centre point where the diagonal ribs met as the highest point, with the infill of all the surfaces sloping upwards towards it, in a domical manner. This solution was employed in Italy at [[San Michele, Pavia]], and [[Sant' Ambrogio, Milan]].&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;

The solution employed in England was to stilt the transverse ribs, maintaining a horizontal central line to the roof like that of a barrel vault.&lt;ref name=BF307/&gt; The diagonal ribs could also be depressed, a solution used on the sexpartite vaults at both the Saint-Étienne, ([[Abbaye-aux-Hommes]]) and Sainte-Trinité, ([[Église de la Ste.-Trinité, Caen|Abbaye-les-Dames]]) at Caen, France, in the late 11th and early 12th centuries.&lt;ref name=BF307/&gt;

====Pointed arched vault====
The problems encountered in the structure and appearance of vaults was solved late in the Romanesque period with the introduction of pointed arched ribs which allowed the height of both diagonal and transverse ribs to be varied in proportion to each other.&lt;ref name=BF307/&gt; Pointed ribs made their first appearance in the transverse ribs of the vaults at [[Durham Cathedral]] in northern England, dating from 1128. Durham is a cathedral of massive Romanesque proportions and appearance, yet its builders introduced several structural features that were new to architectural design and were later to be hallmark features of the Gothic. Another Gothic structural feature employed at Durham is the [[flying buttress]]. However, these are hidden beneath the roofs of the aisles.
The earliest pointed vault in France is that of the narthex of [[Vézelay Abbey|La Madeleine, Vézelay]], dating from 1130.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt; They were subsequently employed with the development of the Gothic style at the east end of the [[Basilica of St Denis]] in Paris in 1140.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt; An early ribbed vault in the Romanesque architecture of Sicily is that of the chancel at the [[Cathedral of Cefalù]].

====Domes====
{{see also|History of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes#Holy Roman Empire}}
Domes in Romanesque architecture are generally found within [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing tower]]s at the intersection of a church's [[nave]] and [[transept]], which conceal the domes externally.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=172}} Called a ''tiburio'', this tower-like structure often has a blind arcade near the roof.{{sfn|Jones|Murray|Murray|2013|p=512}} Romanesque domes are typically octagonal in plan and use corner squinches to translate a square bay into a suitable octagonal base.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt; Octagonal cloister vaults appear "in connection with basilicas almost throughout Europe" between 1050 and 1100.{{sfn|Porter|1928|p=48}} The precise form differs from region to region.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=172}}

==Ecclesiastical architecture==
{{See also|List of regional characteristics of Romanesque churches}}

===Plan===
Many parish churches, abbey churches and cathedrals are in the Romanesque style, or were originally built in the Romanesque style and have subsequently undergone changes.
The simplest Romanesque churches are aisleless halls with a projecting apse at the chancel end, or sometimes, particularly in England, a projecting rectangular chancel with a chancel arch that might be decorated with mouldings. More ambitious churches have aisles separated from the nave by arcades.

Abbey and cathedral churches generally follow the [[Latin Cross]] plan. In England, the extension eastward may be long, while in Italy it is often short or non-existent, the church being of T plan, sometimes with apses on the transept ends as well as to the east. In France the church of St Front, Périgueux, appears to have been modelled on [[St. Mark's Basilica, Venice]], or the Byzantine [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] and is of a [[Greek cross]] plan with five domes.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, F., &amp; Edgell, G. H. (1918). A History of Architecture. New York. Harper &amp; Brothers. 621 pages (page 252).&lt;/ref&gt; In the same region, [[Angoulême Cathedral]] is an aisleless church of the Latin cross plan, more usual in France, but is also roofed with domes.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;
In Germany, Romanesque churches are often of distinctive form, having apses at both east and west ends, the main entrance being central to one side. It is probable that this form came about to accommodate a baptistery at the west end.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

NOTE: The plans below do not show the buildings in their current states.&lt;ref&gt;With the exception of the [[Plan of St. Gall]], which is from an ancient manuscript (and probably does not reflect an actual construction), they are all hypothetical reconstructions of groundplans as they existed in the 12th or 13th centuries. The Abbey Church of St. Gall has been replaced by a Baroque Church. Speyer has had its west front rebuilt twice, Ely Cathedral has lost the eastern arm, being replaced in the Gothic style, the central tower being replaced with the unique octagon and the northwest tower, never rebuilt. It has also gained a west porch. Santiago has had some substantial changes including a Baroque west front.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The [[Abbey of St. Gall|Abbey Church of St. Gall]], Switzerland, shows the plan that was to become common throughout Germanic Europe. It is a [[Latin Cross]] with a comparatively long nave and short transepts and eastern end, which is apsidal. The nave is aisled, but the chancel and transepts are not. It has an apsidal west end, which was to become a feature of Churches of Germany, such as [[Worms Cathedral]]. [[Speyer Cathedral]], Germany, also has aisleless transept and chancel. It has a markedly modular look. A typical Germanic characteristic is the presence of towers framing the chancel and the west end. There is marked emphasis on the western entrance, called ''Westwerk'', which is seen in several other churches. Each vault compartment covers two narrow bays of the nave

At [[Autun Cathedral]], France, the pattern of the nave bays and aisles extends beyond the crossing and into the chancel, each aisle terminating in an apse. Each nave bay is separated at the vault by a transverse rib. Each transept projects to the width of two nave bays. The entrance has a narthex which screens the main portal. This type of entrance was to be elaborated in the Gothic period on the transepts at Chartres. [[Angoulême Cathedral]], France, is one of several instances in which the Byzantine churches of Constantinople seem to have been influential in the design in which the main spaces are roofed by domes. This structure has necessitated the use of very thick walls, and massive piers from which the domes spring. There are radiating chapels around the apse, which is a typically French feature and was to evolve into the [[chevet]].

As was typically the case in England, [[Ely Cathedral]] was a Benedictine monastery, serving both monastic and secular function. To facilitate this, the chancel or "presbytery" is longer than usually found in Europe, as are the aisled transepts which contained chapels. In England, emphasis was placed on the orientation of the chapels to the east. The very large piers at the crossing signify that there was once a tower. The western end having two round towers flanking a tall central tower was unique in Britain. Ely Cathedral was never vaulted and retains a wooden ceiling over the nave.

[[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|The cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]] shares many features with Ely, but is typically Spanish in its expansive appearance. Santiago held the body of St. James and was the most significant pilgrimage site in Europe. The narthex, the aisles, the large aisled transepts and numerous projecting chapels reflect this. The chancel is short, compared to that of Ely, and the altar set so as to provide clear view to a vast congregation simultaneously.

[[Modena Cathedral]] shows a typically Italian Romanesque plan, often architecturally termed a "[[basilica]]", because of its similarity in plan to a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] basilicas.

===Section===
In section, the typical aisled church or cathedral has a nave with a single aisle on either side. The nave and aisles are separated by an arcade carried on piers or on columns. The roof of the aisle and the outer walls help to buttress the upper walls and vault of the nave, if present. Above the aisle roof are a row of windows known as the clerestory, which give light to the nave. During the Romanesque period there was a development from this two-stage elevation to a three-stage elevation in which there is a gallery, known as a ''[[triforium]]'', between the arcade and the clerestory. This varies from a simple blind arcade decorating the walls, to a narrow arcaded passage, to a fully developed second story with a row of windows lighting the gallery.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Church and cathedral east ends===
The eastern end of a Romanesque church is almost always semi-circular, with either a high chancel surrounded by an ambulatory as in France, or a square end from which an apse projects as in Germany and Italy. Where square ends exist in English churches, they are probably influenced by [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Anglo Saxon]] churches. Peterborough and Norwich Cathedrals have retained round east ends in the French style. However, in France, simple churches without apses and with no decorative features were built by the [[Cistercians]] who also founded many houses in England, frequently in remote areas.&lt;ref name=FHC&gt;{{cite book |first=Frederick H. |last=Crossley |year=1962 |title=The English Abbey |location= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Church and cathedral façades and external decoration===
Romanesque church facades, generally to the west end of the building, are usually symmetrical, have a large central portal made significant by its mouldings or porch, and an arrangement of arched-topped windows. In Italy there is often a single central ocular or wheel window.&lt;ref name=BF309/&gt; The common decorative feature is arcading.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;

Smaller churches often have a single tower that is usually placed to the western end in France or England, either centrally or to one side, while larger churches and cathedrals often have two.

In France, [[Abbaye-aux-Hommes|Saint-Étienne, Caen]], presents the model of a large French Romanesque facade. It is a symmetrical arrangement of nave flanked by two tall towers each with two buttresses of low flat profile that divide the facade into three vertical units. The lowest stage is marked by large doors, each set within an arch in each of the three vertical sections. The wider central section has two tiers of three identical windows, while in the outer sections there are two tiers of single windows, giving emphasis to the mass of the towers. The towers rise above the facade through three further tiers, the lowest of tall blind arcading, the next of arcading pierced by two narrow windows and the third of two large windows, divided into two lights by a colonnette.&lt;ref name=NP/&gt;

This facade can be seen as the foundation for many other buildings, including both French and English Gothic churches. While the form is typical of northern France, its various components were common to many Romanesque churches of the period across Europe. Similar facades are found in Portugal. In England, [[Southwell Cathedral]] has maintained this form, despite the insertion of a huge Gothic window between the towers. [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and [[Durham Cathedral|Durham]] must once have looked like this. In Germany, [[Limburg Cathedral]] has a rich variety of openings and arcades in horizontal storeys of varying heights.

The churches of [[San Zeno Maggiore, Verona]], and [[San Michele, Pavia]], present two types of facade that are typical of Italian Romanesque, that which reveals the architectural form of the building, and that which screens it. At San Zeno, the components of nave and aisles are made clear by the vertical shafts that rise to the level of the central gable and by the varying roof levels. At [[San Miniato al Monte]] the definition of the architectural parts is made even clearer by the [[polychrome]] marble, a feature of many Italian Medieval facades, particularly in Tuscany.
At San Michele the vertical definition is present as at San Zeno, but the rooflines are screened behind a single large gable decorated with stepped arcading. At [[Santa Maria della Pieve]], [[Arezzo]], this screening is carried even further, as the roofline is horizontal and the arcading rises in many different levels while the colonettes that support them have a great diversity of decoration.&lt;ref name=HG/&gt;&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

In the [[Rhineland]] and Netherlands the Carolingian form of west end known as the [[westwerk]] prevailed. Towers and apse of the western end are often incorporated into a multi-storey structure that bears little structural or visual relationship to the building behind it. These westwerks take a great variety of forms as may be seen at [[Maria Laach Abbey]], [[Collegiate Church of Saint Gertrude, Nivelles|St Gertrude, Nivelles]], and [[Basilica of Saint Servatius|St Serviatius]], Maastricht.

===Church towers===
Towers were an important feature of Romanesque churches and a great number of them are still standing. They take a variety of forms: square, circular and octagonal, and are positioned differently in relation to the church building in different countries. In northern France, two large towers, such as those at Caen, were to become an integral part of the facade of any large abbey or cathedral. In central and southern France this is more variable and large churches may have one tower or a central tower. Large churches of [[Romanesque architecture in Spain|Spain]] and [[Portuguese Romanesque architecture|Portugal]] usually have two towers.

Many abbeys of France, such as that at Cluny, had many towers of varied forms. This is also common in Germany, where the apses were sometimes framed with circular towers and the crossing surmounted by an octagonal tower as at [[Worms Cathedral]]. Large paired towers of square plan could also occur on the transept ends, such as those at [[Tournai Cathedral]] in Belgium. In Germany, where four towers frequently occur, they often have spires that may be four or eight sided, or the distinctive ''Rhenish helm'' shape seen on the cathedrals of [[Limburger Dom|Limburg]]&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt; or [[Speyer Cathedral|Speyer]]. It is also common to see bell or onion-shaped spires of the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque period]] surmounting Romanesque towers in central and Eastern Europe.

In England, for large abbeys and cathedral buildings, three towers were favoured, with the central tower being the tallest. This was often not achieved, through the slow process of the building stages, and in many cases the upper parts of the tower were not completed until centuries later as at Durham and Lincoln. Large Norman towers exist at the cathedrals of Durham, [[Exeter Cathedral|Exeter]], [[Southwell Minster|Southwell]], [[Norwich Cathedral|Norwich]] and [[Tewkesbury Abbey]].&lt;ref name=ACT/&gt;&lt;ref name=FHC/&gt; Such towers were often topped during the late Medieval period with a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] spire of wooden construction covered with lead, copper or [[roof shingle|shingles]]. In the case of Norwich Cathedral, the huge, ornate, 12th-century crossing-tower received a 15th-century masonry spire rising to a height of 320 feet and remaining to this day.

In Italy towers are almost always free standing and the position is often dictated by the landform of the site, rather than aesthetics. This is the case in nearly all Italian churches both large and small, except in Sicily where a number of churches were founded by the Norman rulers and are more French in appearance.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;

As a general rule, large Romanesque towers are square with corner buttresses of low profile, rising without diminishing through the various stages. Towers are usually marked into clearly defined stages by horizontal courses. As the towers rise, the number and size of openings increases as can be seen on the right tower of the transept of [[Tournai Cathedral]] where two narrow slits in the fourth level from the top becomes a single window, then two windows, then three windows at the uppermost level. This sort of arrangement is particularly noticeable on the towers of Italian churches, which are usually built of brick and may have no other ornament. Two fine examples occur at [[Lucca]], at the church of [[Basilica di San Frediano|San Frediano]] and at the ''[[Lucca Cathedral|Duomo]]''. It is also seen in [[Romanesque architecture in Spain|Spain]].&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;

In Italy there are a number of large free-standing towers that are circular, the most famous of these being the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]]. In other countries where circular towers occur, such as Germany, they are usually paired and often flank an apse. Circular towers are uncommon in England, but occur throughout the Early Medieval period in Ireland.

Polygonal towers were often used on crossings and occur in France, Germany, Italy and Spain such as that of the [[Old Cathedral, Salamanca]], which is covered by a dome supported on a ribbed vault.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;

Smaller churches sometimes had [[bell-gable]]s instead of towers, a feature which, according to some authors, is characteristic of the simplicity of much architecture in the Romanesque style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elripolles.com/que-vols-fer/turisme-cultural/romanic/romanic-de-la-vall-de-camprodon/7.html |title=Romànic de la Vall de Camprodon |publisher=Elripolles.com |date=9 March 2010 |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Portals===
Romanesque churches generally have a single portal centrally placed on the west front, the focus of decoration for the facade of the building. Some churches such as [[Abbaye aux Hommes|Saint-Étienne]], Caen, (11th century) and [[Pisa Cathedral]] (late 12th century) had three western portals, in the manner of [[Early Christian architecture|Early Christian]] basilicas. Many churches, both large and small, had lateral entrances that were commonly used by worshippers.

Romanesque doorways have a character form, with the jambs having a series of receding planes, into each of which is set a circular shaft, all surmounted by a continuous abacus. The semi-circular arch which rises from the abacus has the same seried planes and circular mouldings as the jambs.&lt;ref name=BF309&gt;Banister Fletcher p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; There are typically four planes containing three shafts, but there may be as many as twelve shafts, symbolic of the apostles.

The opening of the portal may be arched, or may be set with a lintel supporting a tympanum, generally carved, but in Italy sometimes decorated with mosaic or fresco. A carved tympanum generally constitutes the major sculptural work of a Romanesque church. The subject of the carving on a major portal may be Christ in Majesty or the Last Judgement. Lateral doors may include other subjects such as the [[Nativity in art|Birth of Christ]]. The portal may be protected by a porch, with simple open porches being typical of Italy, and more elaborate structures typical of France and Spain.

===Interiors===
The structure of large churches differed regionally and developed across the centuries. The use of piers of rectangular plan to support arcades was common, as at Mainz Cathedral and St Gertrude Nivelle, and remained usual in smaller churches across Europe, with the arcades often taking the form of openings through the surface of a wall. In Italy, where there was a strong tradition of using marble columns, complete with capital, base and abacus, this remained prevalent, often reusing existent ancient columns, as at San Miniato al Monte. A number of 11th-century churches have naves distinguished by huge circular columns with no clerestory, or a very small one as at St Philibert, Tournus. In England stout columns of large diameter supported decorated arches, gallery and clerestory, as at the nave of Malmesbury Abbey (see "Piers and columns", above). By the early 12th century composite piers had evolved, in which the attached shafts swept upward to a ribbed vault or were continued into the mouldings of the arcade, as at Vézelay Abbey, Saint-Étienne, Caen, and Peterborough Cathedral.

The nature of the internal roofing varied greatly, from open timber roofs, and wooden ceilings of different types, which remained common in smaller churches, to simple barrel vaults and groin vaults and increasingly to the use of ribbed vaults in the late 11th and 12th centuries, which were to become a common feature of larger abbey churches and cathedrals. A number of Romanesque churches are roofed with a series of Domes. At [[Fontevrault Abbey]] the nave is covered by four domes, while at the Church of Saint Front, [[Périgueux]], the church is of [[Greek cross]] plan, with a central dome surrounded by four smaller domes over the nave, chancel and transepts.

Internal decoration varied across Europe. Where wide expanses of wall existed, they were often plastered and painted. Wooden ceilings and timber beams were decorated. In Italy walls were sometimes faced with polychrome marble. Where buildings were constructed of stone that was suitable for carving, many decorative details occur, including ornate capitals and mouldings.

The apsidal east end was often a focus of decoration, with both architectonic forms such as arcading and pictorial features such as carved figures, murals and occasionally mosaics. Stained glass came into increasing use from the 11th century. In many churches the eastern end has been rebuilt in a later style. Of England's Norman cathedrals, no eastern end remains unchanged. In France the eastern terminals of the important abbeys of Caen, Vézelay and, most significantly, the [[Basilica of St Denis]] were completely rebuilt in the Gothic style. In Germany, major reconstructions of the 19th century sought to return many Romanesque buildings to their original form. Examples of simple Romanesque apses can be seen in the images of St Gertrude, Nivelles; St Philibert, Tournus, and San Miniato al Monte.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Other structures===
Among the structures associated with church buildings are crypts, porches, chapter houses, cloisters and baptisteries.

'''[[Crypt]]s''' are often present as an underlying structure to a substantial church, and are generally a completely discrete space, but occasionally, as in some Italian churches, may be a sunken space under a raised chancel and open, via steps, to the body of the nave. Romanesque crypts have survived in many instances, such as [[Canterbury Cathedral]], when the church itself has been rebuilt.
The usual construction of a Romanesque crypt is with many short stout columns carrying groin vaults, as at [[Worcester Cathedral]].

'''[[Porch]]es''' sometimes occur as part of the original design of a facade. This is very much the case in Italy, where they are usually only one bay deep and are supported on two columns, often resting on couchant lions, as at St Zeno, Verona.&lt;small&gt;See above.&lt;/small&gt; Elsewhere, porches of various dates have been added to the facade or side entrance of existent churches and may be quite a substantial structure, with several bays of vaulting supported on an open or partially open arcade, and forming a sort of narthex as at the Church of St Maria, Laach.&lt;small&gt;See above&lt;/small&gt; In Spain, Romanesque churches often have large lateral porches, like loggias.

'''[[Chapter house]]s''' often occur adjacent to monastic or cathedral churches. Few have survived intact from the Romanesque period. Early chapter houses were rectangular in shape, with the larger ones sometimes having groin or ribbed vaults supported on columns. Later Romanesque chapter houses sometimes had an apsidal eastern end. The chapter house at Durham Cathedral is a wide space with a ribbed vault, restored as originally constructed in 1130. The circular chapter house at Worcester Cathedral, built by Bishop Wulfstan (1062–95), was the first circular chapter house in Europe and was much imitated in England.

'''[[Cloister]]s''' are generally part of any [[Romanesque secular and domestic architecture#Monastic buildings|monastic complex]] and also occur at cathedral and collegiate churches. They were essential to the communal way of life, a place for both working during daylight hours and relaxing during inclement weather. They usually abut the church building and are enclosed with windowless walls on the outside and an open arcade on the inside, looking over a courtyard or "cloister garth". They may be vaulted or have timber roofs. The arcades are often richly decorated and are home to some of the most fanciful carved capitals of the Romanesque period with those of [[Santo Domingo de Silos]] in Spain and the [[Moissac Abbey|Abbey of St Pierre]] Moissac, being examples. Many Romanesque cloisters have survived in Spain, France, Italy and Germany, along with some of their associated buildings.

'''[[Baptistery|Baptisteries]]''' often occur in Italy as a free standing structure, associated with a cathedral. They are generally octagonal or circular and domed. The interior may be arcaded on several levels as at [[Pisa Cathedral]]. Other notable Romanesque baptisteries are that at [[Parma Cathedral]] remarkable for its galleried exterior, and the polychrome [[Florence Baptistery|Baptistery of San Giovanni]] of Florence Cathedral, with vault mosaics of the 13th century including Christ in Majesty, possibly the work of the almost legendary [[Coppo di Marcovaldo]].

===Decoration===

====Architectural embellishment====
Arcading is the single most significant decorative feature of Romanesque architecture. It occurs in a variety of forms, from the [[Lombard band]], which is a row of small arches that appear to support a roofline or course, to shallow blind arcading that is often a feature of English architecture and is seen in great variety at [[Ely Cathedral]], to the open dwarf gallery, first used at [[Speyer Cathedral]] and widely adopted in Italy as seen on both [[Pisa Cathedral]] and its famous [[Leaning Tower]]. Arcades could be used to great effect, both externally and internally, as exemplified by the church of Santa Maria della Pieve, in Arezzo.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Architectural sculpture====
The Romanesque period produced a profusion of sculptural ornamentation. This most frequently took a purely geometric form and was particularly applied to mouldings, both straight courses and the curved moldings of arches. In La Madeleine, Vezelay, for example, the polychrome ribs of the vault are all edged with narrow filets of pierced stone. Similar decoration occurs around the arches of the nave and along the horizontal course separating arcade and clerestory. Combined with the pierced carving of the capitals, this gives a delicacy and refinement to the interior.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

In England, such decoration could be discrete, as at [[Hereford Cathedral|Hereford]] and Peterborough cathedrals, or have a sense of massive energy as at Durham where the diagonal ribs of the vaults are all outlined with [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]s, the mouldings of the nave arcade are carved with several layers of the same and the huge columns are deeply incised with a variety of geometric patterns creating an impression of directional movement. These features combine to create one of the richest and most dynamic interiors of the Romanesque period.&lt;ref&gt;Alec Clifton-Taylor says "With the Cathedral of Durham we reach the incomparable masterpiece of Romanesque architecture not only in England but anywhere."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although much sculptural ornament was sometimes applied to the interiors of churches, the focus of such decoration was generally the west front, and in particular, the portals. Chevrons and other geometric ornaments, referred to by 19th-century writers as "barbaric ornament", are most frequently found on the mouldings of the central door. Stylized foliage often appears, sometimes deeply carved and curling outward after the manner of the acanthus leaves on [[Corinthian order|Corinthian capitals]], but also carved in shallow relief and spiral patterns, imitating the intricacies of manuscript illuminations. In general, the style of ornament was more classical in Italy, such as that seen around the door of [[San Giusto, Lucca|San Giusto]] in [[Lucca]], and more "barbaric" in England, Germany and Scandinavia, such as that seen at [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and [[Speyer Cathedral]]s. France produced a great range of ornament, with particularly fine interwoven and spiralling vines in the "manuscript" style occurring at [[Basilique de Saint-Sernin, Toulouse|Saint-Sernin]], Toulouse.&lt;ref name=OME/&gt;&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Figurative sculpture====
{{main|Romanesque art}}
With the fall of the Roman Empire, the tradition of carving large works in stone and sculpting figures in bronze died out. The best-known surviving large sculptural work of Proto-Romanesque Europe is the life-size wooden Crucifix commissioned by [[Gero (Archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Gero of Cologne]] in about 960–65.&lt;ref&gt;See details at [[Cologne Cathedral]].&lt;/ref&gt; During the 11th and 12th centuries, figurative sculpture flourished in a distinctly Romanesque style that can be recognised across Europe, although the most spectacular sculptural projects are concentrated in South-Western France, Northern Spain and Italy.

Major figurative decoration occurs particularly around the portals of cathedrals and churches, ornamenting the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], lintels, jambs and central posts. The tympanum is typically decorated with the imagery of [[Christ in Majesty]] with the symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]], drawn directly from the gilt covers of medieval [[Gospel Book]]s. This style of doorway occurs in many places and continued into the Gothic period. A rare survival in England is that of the "Prior's Door" at [[Ely Cathedral]]. In France, many have survived, with impressive examples at the [[Abbey of Saint-Pierre, Moissac]], the [[Abbey of Sainte-Marie, Souillac]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Howe |first=Jeffery |title=Romanesque Architecture (slides) |work=A digital archive of architecture |publisher=[[Boston College]] |url= http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/fnart/arch/souillac.html |accessdate=2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abbey of la Madaleine, Vézelay]]&amp;nbsp;– all daughter houses of Cluny, with extensive other sculpture remaining in cloisters and other buildings. Nearby, [[Autun Cathedral]] has a [[Last Judgement]] of great rarity in that it has uniquely been signed by its creator Giselbertus (who was perhaps the patron rather than the sculptor).&lt;ref name=HG/&gt;&lt;ref name=RH/&gt; The same artist is thought to have worked at la Madaleine Vezelay which uniquely has two elaborately carved tympanum, the early inner one representing the Last Judgement and that on the outer portal of the narthex representing Jesus [[Great Commission|sending forth the Apostles]] to preach to the nations.

It is a feature of Romanesque art, both in manuscript illumination and sculptural decoration, that figures are contorted to fit the space that they occupy. Among the many examples that exist, one of the finest is the figure of the [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Prophet Jeremiah]] from the pillar of the portal of the [[Abbey of Saint-Pierre, Moissac]], France, from about 1130.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt; A significant motif of Romanesque design is the spiral, a form applied to both plant motifs and drapery in Romanesque sculpture. An outstanding example of its use in drapery is that of the central figure of Christ on the outer portal at [[Vézelay Abbey|La Madaleine, Vezelay]].&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

Many of the smaller sculptural works, particularly capitals, are Biblical in subject and include scenes of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] and the [[Adam and Eve|Fall of Man]], episodes from the life of Christ and those [[Old Testament]] scenes that [[Typology (theology)|prefigure]] his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Death]] and [[Resurrection]], such as [[Jonah|Jonah and the Whale]] and [[Daniel in the lions' den]]. Many [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]] scenes occur, the theme of the [[Three Kings]] being particularly popular. The cloisters of [[Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey]] in Northern Spain, and [[Moissac]] are fine examples surviving complete.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Murals====
The large wall surfaces and plain curving vaults of the Romanesque period lent themselves to mural decoration. Unfortunately, many of these early wall paintings have been destroyed by damp or the walls have been replastered and painted over. In most of Northern Europe such pictures were systematically destroyed in bouts of [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] [[iconoclasm]]. In other countries they have suffered from war, neglect and changing fashion.

A classic scheme for the full painted decoration of a church, derived from earlier examples often in [[mosaic]], had, as its focal point in the [[semi-dome]] of the apse, [[Christ in Majesty]] or Christ the Redeemer enthroned within a [[mandorla]] and framed by the four winged beasts, symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]], comparing directly with examples from the gilt covers or the illuminations of [[Gospel Book]]s of the period. If the [[Virgin Mary]] was the dedicatee of the church, she might replace Christ here. On the apse walls below would be saints and apostles, perhaps including narrative scenes, for example of the saint to whom the church was dedicated. On the sanctuary arch were figures of apostles, prophets or the twenty-four "[[Heavenly host|elders of the Apocalypse]]", looking in towards a bust of Christ, or his symbol the Lamb, at the top of the arch. The north wall of the nave would contain narrative scenes from the Old Testament, and the south wall from the New Testament. On the rear west wall would be a [[Doom paintings|Doom painting]] or [[Last Judgement]], with an enthroned and judging Christ at the top.&lt;ref&gt;James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', p154, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most intact schemes to exist is that at [[Abbey Church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe|Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe]] in France. &lt;small&gt;(See picture above under "Vault")&lt;/small&gt; The long barrel vault of the nave provides an excellent surface for fresco, and is decorated with scenes of the [[Old Testament]], showing the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]], the [[Adam and Eve|Fall of Man]] and other stories including a lively depiction of [[Noah's Ark]] complete with a fearsome figurehead and numerous windows through with can be seen the Noah and his family on the upper deck, birds on the middle deck, while on the lower are the pairs of animals. Another scene shows with great vigour the swamping of Pharaoh's army by the Red Sea. The scheme extends to other parts of the church, with the martyrdom of the local saints shown in the crypt, and [[Apocalypse]] in the narthex and Christ in Majesty. The range of colours employed is limited to light blue-green, yellow ochre, reddish brown and black. Similar paintings exist in Serbia, Spain, Germany, Italy and elsewhere in France.&lt;ref name=Toman/&gt;

====Stained glass====
The oldest-known fragments of medieval pictorial stained glass appear to date from the 10th century. The earliest intact figures are five prophet windows at Augsburg, dating from the late 11th century. The figures, though stiff and formalised, demonstrate considerable proficiency in design, both pictorially and in the functional use of the glass, indicating that their maker was well accustomed to the medium. At Canterbury and Chartres Cathedrals, a number of panels of the 12th century have survived, including, at Canterbury, a figure of Adam digging, and another of his son Seth from a series of [[Ancestors of Christ]]. Adam represents a highly naturalistic and lively portrayal, while in the figure of Seth, the robes have been used to great decorative effect, similar to the best stone carving of the period.

Many of the magnificent stained glass windows of France, including the famous windows of Chartres, date from the 13th century. Far fewer large windows remain intact from the 12th century. One such is the Crucifixion of Poitiers, a remarkable composition that rises through three stages, the lowest with a quatrefoil depicting the Martyrdom of St Peter, the largest central stage dominated by the crucifixion and the upper stage showing the [[Ascension of Christ]] in a mandorla. The figure of the crucified Christ is already showing the Gothic curve. The window is described by George Seddon as being of "unforgettable beauty".&lt;ref name=GS&gt;George Seddon in Lee, Seddon and Stephens, ''Stained Glass''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transitional style and the continued use of Romanesque forms===
During the 12th century, features that were to become typical of [[Gothic architecture]] began to appear. It is not uncommon, for example, for a part of building that has been constructed over a lengthy period extending into the 12th century, to have very similar arcading of both semi-circular and pointed shape, or windows that are identical in height and width, but in which the later ones are pointed. This can be seen on the towers of [[Tournai Cathedral]] and on the western towers and facade at [[Ely Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=ACT/&gt;&lt;ref name=WS/&gt; Other variations that appear to hover between Romanesque and Gothic occur, such as the facade designed by [[Abbot Suger]] at the Abbey of Saint-Denis, which retains much that is Romanesque in its appearance, and the Facade of [[Laon Cathedral]], which, despite its Gothic form, has round arches.&lt;ref name=WS&gt;Wim Swaan, ''Gothic Cathedrals''&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbot Suger's innovative choir of the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]], 1140–44, led to the adoption of the Gothic style by Paris and its surrounding area, but other parts of France were slower to take it up, and provincial churches continued to be built in the heavy manner and rubble stone of the Romanesque, even when the openings were treated with the fashionable pointed arch.

In England, the Romanesque groundplan, which in that country commonly had a very long nave, continued to affect the style of building of cathedrals and those large abbey churches which were also to become cathedrals at the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] in the 16th century. Despite the fact that English cathedrals were built or rebuilt in many stages, substantial areas of Norman building can be seen in many of them, particularly in the nave arcades. In the case of [[Winchester Cathedral]], the Gothic arches were literally carved out of the existent Norman piers.&lt;ref name=ACT/&gt; Other cathedrals have sections of their building which are clearly an intermediate stage between Norman and Gothic, such as the western towers of [[Ely Cathedral]] and part of the nave at [[Worcester Cathedral]]. The first truly Gothic building in England is the long eastern end of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] commenced in 1175.&lt;ref name=ACT/&gt;

In Italy, although many churches such as [[Florence Cathedral]] and [[Santa Maria Novella]] were built in the Gothic style, or utilising the pointed arch and window tracery, Romanesque features derived from the Roman architectural heritage, such as sturdy columns with capitals of a modified Corinthian form, continued to be used. The pointed vault was utilised where convenient, but it is commonly interspersed with semicircular arches and vaults wherever they conveniently fit. The facades of Gothic churches in Italy are not always easily distinguishable from the Romanesque.

Germany was not quick to adopt the Gothic style, and when it did so in the 1230s, the buildings were often modelled very directly upon French cathedrals, as [[Cologne Cathedral]] was modelled on Amiens. The smaller churches and abbeys continued to be constructed in a more provincial Romanesque manner, the date only being registered by the pointed window openings.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Romanesque castles, houses and other buildings==
{{Main|Romanesque secular and domestic architecture}}
The Romanesque period was a time of great development in the design and construction of defensive architecture. After churches and the monastic buildings with which they are often associated, castles are the most numerous type of building of the period. While most are in ruins through the action of war and politics, others, like William the Conqueror's White Tower within the [[Tower of London]] have remained almost intact.

In some regions, particularly Germany, large [[palace]]s were built for rulers and bishops. Local lords built [[great hall]]s in the countryside, while rich merchants built grand [[town house]]s. In Italy, city councils constructed [[town hall]]s, while wealthy cities of Northern Europe protected their trading interests with [[warehouse]]s and commercial premises. All over Europe, dwellers of the town and country built houses to live in, some of which, sturdily constructed in stone, have remained to this day with sufficient of their form and details intact to give a picture of the style of domestic architecture that was in fashion at the time.

Examples of all these types of buildings can be found scattered across Europe, sometimes as isolated survivals like the two merchants' houses on opposite sides of Steep Hill in [[Lincoln, England]], and sometimes giving form to a whole medieval city like [[San Gimignano]] in Tuscany, Italy. These buildings are the subject of a separate article.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Romanesque Revival==
{{Main|Romanesque Revival architecture}} ''See also'' [[Romanesque Revival architecture in the United Kingdom]]
During the 19th century, when [[Gothic Revival architecture]] was fashionable, buildings were occasionally designed in the Romanesque style. There are a number of Romanesque Revival churches, dating from as early as the 1830s and continuing into the 20th century where the massive and "brutal" quality of the Romanesque style was appreciated and designed in brick.

The [[Natural History Museum, London]], designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], 1879, on the other hand, is a Romanesque revival building that makes full use of the decorative potential of Romanesque arcading and architectural sculpture. The Romanesque appearance has been achieved while freely adapting an overall style to suit the function of the building. The columns of the foyer, for example, give an impression of incised geometric design similar to those of Durham Cathedral. However, the sources of the incised patterns are the trunks of palms, cycads and tropical tree ferns. The animal motifs, of which there are many, include rare and exotic species.

The type of modern buildings for which the Romanesque style was most frequently adapted was the warehouse, where a lack of large windows and an appearance of great strength and stability were desirable features. These buildings, generally of brick, frequently have flattened buttresses rising to wide arches at the upper levels after the manner of some Italian Romanesque facades. This style was adapted to suit commercial buildings by opening the spaces between the arches into large windows, the brick walls becoming a shell to a building that was essentially of modern steel-frame construction, the architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson]] giving his name to the style, [[Richardsonian Romanesque]]. Good examples of the style are [[Marshall Field's Wholesale Store]], Chicago, by H.H. Richardson, 1885, and the Chadwick Lead Works in [[Boston]], USA, by [[William G. Preston|William Preston]], 1887. The style also lent itself to the building of cloth mills, steelworks and powerstations.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=NP/&gt;

==Career==
As an independent curator, Rosa Martínez has organised international exhibitions, including the 51st [[Venice Biennale]] with "Always a Little Further" at the Arsenale (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://universes.art/specials/intimidad-es-politica/rosa-martinez/|title=Rosa Martínez - Biography. Intimacy is Political|website=universes.art|language=en-EN|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of this exhibition was taken from a [[Corto Maltese]] book written by the Venetian-writer [[Hugo Pratt]]. In her curatorial statement Martínez elaborates on this by stating: "Taking a fictional character as inspiration is a way of affirming that art is an imaginary construct and that fantasy helps us towards a better understanding of reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://universes-in-universe.de/car/venezia/bien51/eng/arsenale/text-1.htm|title=Always a Little Further|last=Martínez|first=Rosa|date=February 2005|website=universe in universe - worlds of art|access-date=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, in 1997 she curated the 5th [[Istanbul Biennial|International Istanbul Biennial]] "On Life, Beauty, Translations and other Difficulties"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/5th-international-istanbul-biennial-on-life-beauty-translations-and-other-difficulties/swGbtq4_VcqvLw|title=5th International Istanbul Biennial: On Life, Beauty, Translations and Other Difficulties - Curator: Rosa Martinez - Google Arts &amp; Culture|work=Google Cultural Institute|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and curated the exhibition "Chacun à son gout", which celebrated the 10th anniversary of the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] (2007). 

As an art advisor, Rosa Martínez has broadened the collection of the [[Istanbul Modern|Istanbul Museum of Modern Art]], where she was the Chief Curator from 2004 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/03/arts/design/in-istanbul-creating-a-space-for-modern-art.html|title=In Istanbul, Creating a Space for Modern Art|last=Sachs|first=Susan|date=2005|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her collaboration with the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] in 2007 helped to update its contemporary collection, including works by outstanding young artists. In 2009, Martínez contributed to a publication that shed light on significant works from the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] collection in different historical and artistic contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao Collection|last=Several authors|first=|publisher=Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|year=2009|isbn=978-84-95216-61-8|location=Bilbao|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an art critic, she is a regular contributor to several newspapers and art journals, notably ''[[Le Monde diplomatique|Le Monde diplomatique en español]]'', ''[[Flash Art|Flash Art International]]'', ''[[El País]]'', ''[[Atlantica Revista de Arte y Pensamiento|Atlántica]]'', ''Letra Internacional'' and ''La Guía del Ocio''. She has also written numerous essays for artists' catalogues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32342">'''SF Masterworks''' is a series of [[science fiction]] books started by Millennium and currently published by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]] (both being imprints of the UK based [[Orion Publishing Group]]).

It began in 1999 and comprises selected pieces of science-fiction literature from 1950 onwards (with a few exceptions). The list was compiled by the managing director of [[Orion Books]], [[Malcolm Edwards]], with the help of "leading SF writers and editors" and the goal of bringing important books back into print.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.locusmag.com/2005/Issues/03Edwards.html Locus Online: Malcolm Edwards interview excerpts]&lt;/ref&gt; The list was described by science fiction author [[Iain M. Banks]] as "amazing" and "genuinely the best novels from sixty years of SF".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/promotions/gollancz-sf-masterworks |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621053514/http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/promotions/gollancz-sf-masterworks |archivedate=2013-06-21 |df= }} Orion Books Masterworks Website &lt;/ref&gt;

It has a companion series in the [[Fantasy Masterworks]] line. A separate ''Future Classics''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uksfbooknews.net/2007/09/06/gollancz-editor-simon-spanton-on-the-future-classics-promotion/ Gollancz editor Simon Spanton on the Future Classics promotion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914123601/http://www.uksfbooknews.net/2007/09/06/gollancz-editor-simon-spanton-on-the-future-classics-promotion/ |date=September 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; line has also started featuring eight science fiction novels from the last few decades.

Gollancz officially relaunched the series in March 2010 beginning with reissues of the first ten titles. These titles have new cover designs (no longer featuring numbers) and introductions, and other existing titles are planned to be reprinted. Gollancz also added new titles to the series beginning in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Gollancz Science Fiction and Fantasy New Books Catalogue: Jan-July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Also published in the 1999-2009 ''SF Masterworks'' numbered paperback series.

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; Also published in the current (since 2010) ''SF Masterworks'' new design series.

==New design==

[[File:SF_Masterworks_table_display_at_London_bookshop,_May_2017.jpg|thumb|left|A selection of titles from the series on display at a London bookshop.]]

The new designs sport yellow/white spines, with the SF Masterworks logo written vertically down the left hand side of the cover.  For titles that were previously issued in the original series, generally the cover artwork is tinted in a different colour from the original version; for example, [[The Dispossessed]] cover artwork is primarily red in the original release, but was partly tinted green when republished in the new series.

In the [[performing arts]], a '''stage mother''' is the mother of a [[child actor]]. The mother will often drive her child to auditions, make sure he or she is on the [[Set construction|set]] on time, etc.  The term ''stage mother'' sometimes has a negative connotation, suggesting that the individual is prone to obnoxiously demanding special treatment for her child, or suggesting that the individual has placed inappropriate pressure on her child to succeed, perhaps for reasons of vicariously living out her own dreams through the child&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/matter-personality/201109/living-vicariously-through-children-twist|title=Living Vicariously through Children with a Twist|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Entitled and grandiose demands have sometimes led to reportedly veiled threats from a stage parent.

==Definition==
A stage mother may also be the official manager of her child (e.g., [[Rose Thompson Hovick]], [[Dina Lohan]], [[Judy Garland|Ethel Gumm]], [[Teri Shields]], [[Hilary Duff|Susan Duff]], etc.) &amp;mdash; representing her child in negotiations for the professional services of her child. Such managers have often been referred to as "momagers" in the film industry.&lt;ref name="momager"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2011/07/13/beyonce-manager-matthew-knowles-britney-spears-kardashian-simpson/#more-50228|title=From Beyonce To Britney Spears, Is It Ever A Good Idea To Be Managed By A Parent?|accessdate=12 October 2014}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain cases where a mother and child both work in the film industry, an automatic labeling of "stage mother" can be affixed to the mother{{by whom|date=October 2014}} without cause. [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] has been against the concept of stage mothers and had explained that when her son Cody co-starred with her in the film ''[[Model Behavior]]'', it had been on his own volition to try acting and not at her insistence.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Gifford plays a stage mother in that movie.

Fathers have also been known to manage their children in this way, such as [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joseph Jackson]] (patriarch of the [[Jackson family]]), [[Murry Wilson]] (father of three of [[The Beach Boys]]), Joe Simpson (father of [[Jessica Simpson|Jessica]] and [[Ashlee Simpson]]), Jeff Archuleta (father of ''[[American Idol]]'' runner-up [[David Archuleta]]), [[Mathew Knowles]] (father of [[Beyoncé]] and [[Solange Knowles]]) and [[Kit Culkin]] (father of [[Macaulay Culkin|Macaulay]] and [[Kieran Culkin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4705759/The-father-from-hell.html|title=The father from hell?|date=1996-11-09|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; A historical example of such a father was [[Leopold Mozart]], who recognized [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|his son's]] musical ability at an early age and made the most of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holmes |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Holmes (musicologist) |date=1845 |title=The Life of Mozart Including His Correspondence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.]], father of Tejano superstar [[Selena]], is credited with having discovered Selena's gift of singing; he rounded up her and her siblings as a band (Selena y Los Dinos), named for his band in his younger days.

Stage fathers share a similar role with parents promoting their children in professional sports&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2017/03/16/lavar-ball-hurt-lonzo-ball-nba-draft-stock-ucla-march-madness/99248918/|title=Could LaVar Ball scare NBA teams from drafting Lonzo Ball?|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The drive to enhance their child's success, and vicariously the father's own financial furtherance and fame can include implementation of strength and exercise regimens at a young age and  backhanded actions such as delaying enrollment in school so their sons will be bigger than their classmates.&lt;ref&gt;"Was it Guys Like These who Ruined Sportsmanship....or was it Just Us?"

== Script mother ==
A variant of the term has been a "script mother", or a woman writer who sees her children as a means for writing books or screenplays based on humiliating events in the child's life, to the detriment of the child, or exaggerating a child's personal problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Script mothers can be writers, comedians or cartoonists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

An example of a script mother has been [[Lynn Johnston]], who has been criticized for exploiting her children (and husband) in her comic strip ''For Better or for Worse'', as opposed to many cartoonists such as Charles Schultz and Berke Breathed who make up fictional characters. Johnston's children eventually had to be pulled out of school due to the constant bullying and embarrassment they received in being compared to their comic strip counterparts, and placed into a [[private school]] with tougher regulations on student conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Johnston "Kate and I were constantly bullied due to the strip" Suddenly Silver, 25 Years of FBOFW, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Milano teatro Carcano.JPG|thumb|The entrance to the Teatro Carcano photographed in 2014]] 
The '''Teatro Carcano''' is a theatre in [[Milan]], Italy located at 63 Corso di Porta Romana. Although now exclusively devoted to plays and dance, it served as an opera house for much of the 19th century and saw the premieres of several important operas. Completed in 1803, the theatre was commissioned by the Milanese aristocrat and theatre-lover Giuseppe Carcano and originally designed by [[Luigi Canonica]]. Over the succeeding two centuries it has undergone several restructurings and renovations and for time in the mid-20th century functioned as a cinema.

==History==
The Teatro Carcano was commissioned by the Milanese aristocrat and theatre-lover Giuseppe Carcano who entrusted the project to the young architect [[Luigi Canonica]]. Planning began in 1801 and construction began the following year. On 3 September 1803 the theatre was inaugurated with the world premieres of two works by the composer [[Vincenzo Federici]]—the opera ''Zaira'' with a libretto by Mattia Butturini and the ballet ''Alfredo il Grande'' with choreography by Paolo Franchi.&lt;ref&gt;Casaglia, Gherardo (2005). [http://www.amadeusonline.net/almanacco?r=&amp;alm_sett=&amp;alm_giorno=3&amp;alm_mese=9&amp;alm_anno=1803&amp;alm_testo= "3 settembre 1803"]. Almanacco Amadeus. Retrieved 14 October 2015 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "360degrees"&gt;Olivari, Stefano and Brasca, Giulia (2015). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tHrxCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA332 ''Milan 360°], pp. 332–333. OlliService Multimedia&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carcano was built on the site of the former convent of San Lazzaro in the [[Porta Romana (Milan)|Porta Romana district]] of Milan. It was modelled on the two most important public theatres in the city, [[La Scala]] (built in 1778) and the [[Teatro Lirico (Milan)|Teatro alla Cannobiana]] (built in 1779).&lt;ref name = "360degrees" /&gt; Like those theatres it was designed in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] style with a horseshoe-shaped auditorium and four tiers of boxes. In total, it could accommodate 1500 spectators. The interior was lavishly decorated in stucco and gold leaf with frescoes and a large ceiling [[Medallion (architecture)|medallion]] over the auditorium. Contemporary descriptions of the opening performances praised not only the decor but also the extensive illumination provided for the stage. The theatre had its own restaurant and [[pâtisserie]], and in 1806 a gambling casino was added.&lt;ref name = "Lynn"&gt;Lynn, Karyl Charna (2005). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eQK2AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41 ''Italian Opera Houses and Festivals''], pp. 41–43. Scarecrow Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gutierrez" /&gt;

The theatre was modernized and partially restructured in 1872 by the Milanese architect [[Achille Sfondrini]]. Opera and classical music concerts continued to be performed throughout the 19th century, although the premieres were increasingly by lesser known composers and the programming was expanded to include prose drama, band concerts, and circuses. By 1904 the theatre, which was essentially constructed of wood was pronounced a serious fire hazard and closed. It was almost completely demolished and then rebuilt in stone to a design by Nazzareno Moretti. The resurrected theatre reopened in 1914.

==Notable performances and premieres==
The Teatro Carcano saw the Milan premiere of Verdi's ''[[La battaglia di Legnano]]'' (1859); the first concert of Wagner's music to be given in the city (conducted by [[Franco Faccio]], 1883); and the Italian premiere of Massenet's ''[[Manon]]'' (1893).&lt;ref&gt;Busch, Hans (ed.) (1997).

Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The actress [[Eleonora Duse]] appeared before Milanese audiences for the first time in May 1884 in a season of plays performed at the Carcano by Cesare Rossi's theatre company. Duse performed in the leading roles in ''[[Fédora]]'' which opened the season and ''[[The Lady of the Camellias]]'' which ended it.&lt;ref name = "Gutierrez"&gt;Gutierrez, Beniamino (1916).

Operas which had their world premieres at the theatre include: 
*''Zaira'' by Vincenzo Federici, 3 September 1803
*''[[Anna Bolena]]'' by [[Gaetano Donizetti]] , 26 December 1830
*''[[La sonnambula]]'' by [[Vincenzo Bellini]], 6 March 1831
*''[[Flora mirabilis]]'' by [[Spyros Samaras]], 16 May 1886

'''''The Golden Turkey Awards''''' is a 1980 book by film critic [[Michael Medved]] and his brother Harry.

==About==
The book awards "Golden Turkey Awards" to [[film]]s judged by the authors as poor in quality, and to [[film director|directors]] and actors judged to have created a chronically inept body of work. The book features many low-budget obscurities and exploitation films such as ''[[Rat Pfink a Boo Boo]]'', ''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]'', and the apparently lost ''[[Him (film)|Him]]''. Other categories include expensive, big studio failures like ''[[The Swarm (film)|The Swarm]]'' and popular films such as ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.

In the introduction the authors admit that "we know our choices will not please everyone&amp;mdash;least of all the actors, producers, writers and directors who are honored in the pages that follow. We further recognize that the number of bad films is so enormous and the competition for the very worst is so intense, that all decisions reached here are subject to considerable second-guessing. Nevertheless, we have researched the subject thoroughly&amp;mdash;sitting through more than 2,000 wretched films in the last few years&amp;mdash;and we believe that our nominees and award winners can stand the test of time."

The Medveds had previously celebrated bad cinema in ''[[The Fifty Worst Films of All Time]]'', many of which were also featured in the various ''Golden Turkey Awards'' categories. Subsequently, they turned their attention to [[box office bomb]]s in ''[[The Hollywood Hall of Shame]]''. They also published a sequel to ''The Golden Turkey Awards'', ''Son of Golden Turkey Awards,'' in 1986. They declared that ''Son of Golden Turkey Awards'' "is our last word...we hereby solemnly pledge that the years ahead will produce no further Golden Turkey publications by the Medved Brothers...we now pass the torch to whichever brave souls feel ready to take up the challenge." ''Son of Golden Turkey Awards'' also listed a "Who's Who in the World of Bad Movies" at the end of its awards presentations.

The Golden Turkey Awards formed the basis of a 1983 television series ''[[The Worst of Hollywood]]'' hosted by Michael Medved.

==Awards given==
In the book ''The Fifty Worst Films of All Time'' the authors invited readers to write in nominating their favorite "worst films". More than 3,000 ballots were received. Based on these votes, the Worst Film of All Time award was given to ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' by [[Ed Wood]].

Wood is also awarded the title of Worst Director of All Time, judged by the authors. 
[[Raquel Welch]] is judged the Worst Actress of All Time over nominees including [[Candice Bergen]] and [[Mamie van Doren]].

[[Richard Burton]] is judged as the Worst Actor of All Time over nominees [[John Agar]], [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Victor Mature]]. While conceding he is sometimes brilliant, the authors claim Burton's "occasional triumphs only serve to highlight the pathetic waste in most of his films; for every ''[[Equus (film)|Equus]]'' in which he appears there are at least a half-dozen ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''s or ''[[Boom! (1968 film)|Boom!]]''s. The authors state that "when he is bad ... well, he's just the pits" and list several "bad" films in which he has appeared: ''[[The Sandpiper]]'', ''[[Hammersmith Is Out]]'', ''[[The Voyage (film)|The Voyage]]'', ''[[The Medusa Touch]]'' and ''[[The Assassination of Trotsky]]''. Another Burton film, ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]'', is the book's first runner up in the Worst Film of All Time award based on reader response.

* First Runner-Up: ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]''
* Worst Film: ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''

==Hoax film==
One of the films nominated in the book was in fact an invention of the authors, and readers were challenged to figure out which film was actually fake. The fake film was ''Dog of Norway'' featuring "Muki the Wonder Hound". This film was illustrated using a photo of a co-author's dog. The giveaway was that the same dog was in the photo of the authors in the back of the book. Another film in the book, the now-lost 1974 porn film ''[[Him (film)|Him]]'', has also been cited as the hoax, though it is known to have existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mark Goodacre |authorlink=Mark Goodacre |date=May 19, 2005 |title=Gay Jesus Film Hoax? |work=NT Blog |url=http://ntweblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/gay-jesus-film-hoax.html |accessdate=2009-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No formal clarification of the hoax film was provided by the subsequent release, ''The Hollywood Hall of Shame''. That book again features the same dog pictured with the authors (as did the subsequent ''Son of Golden Turkey Awards''). In ''The Hollywood Hall of Shame'', in reference to the dish barbecued dog, the authors explain that it was "a snack which produced a mixed reaction among the representatives of an industry that had given the world [[Lassie]], [[Rin Tin Tin]], [[Benji]], [[Phyllis Diller]], and Muki the Wonder Hound."&lt;ref&gt;Harry Medved and [[Michael Medved]]. ''[[The Hollywood Hall of Shame]]'' London, Sydney, Melbourne, Singapore, Manila: Angus and Robertson Publishers, 1984. {{ISBN|0-207-14929-1}}. p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Acknowledgements" page of ''The Fifty Worst Films of All Time'' ends with:
::And love, most of all, to Muki, who was there to understand when the going got rough.

'''''The Last Victim: A True-Life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer''''' (1999) is a non-fiction work by author [[Jason Moss (writer)|Jason Moss]] in which he details his fascination and subsequent correspondence with several notorious American [[serial killer]]s.

==Plot==
In 1994, Moss was an 18-year-old college student at UNLV. While studying for his honors thesis, he established relationships by correspondence with [[John Wayne Gacy]], [[Richard Ramirez]], [[Henry Lee Lucas]], [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], and [[Charles Manson]]. He obtained samples of correspondence from and interviews with these men. Moss researched what would most interest each subject, and cast himself in the role of disciple, admirer, surrogate, or potential victim.

In his book Moss said that he had been interested in a career with the [[FBI]]. He thought that gaining the trust of a serial killer, possibly learning more about their stated crimes or unsolved murders, was a way to distinguish himself as a job candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, J with Jeffrey Kottler: ''The Last Victim: A True-Life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer'', chapter 3. Grand Central Publishing, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moss forged the strongest relationship with Gacy; their letters led to regular Sunday morning phone calls, during which Gacy reiterated his innocence even as he gave Moss a guided tour of his world. In the book, Moss recounts his correspondence and eventual two meetings with Gacy about two months before the killer was executed. Moss believed that he became Gacy's "last victim" after this face-to-face meeting in prison, in essence being psychologically overpowered by the [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]], depraved [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]]. For a time he suffered nightmares from the encounter.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; Moss felt that this misadventure allowed him to understand how a killer's mind works in controlling the vulnerable and forcing them to submission. He based the title of his book on this episode.

==Reception==
The book became a bestseller, selling 76,000 copies in its first 10 weeks. In 2000 the paperback edition also appeared on the Bestseller List of the ''[[New York Times]]''.

Sales were boosted by controversy over Moss's methods. The author was interviewed on TV's ''20/20'' and ''Hard Copy'', and radio's ''[[The Howard Stern Show]].'' People argued whether Moss was exploiting the lurid histories of these killers or whether he contributed to studies of criminal psychology.

Jason Moss committed [[suicide]] in June 2006. His co-author Kottler said that he had given no indication of distress.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;Kalil, M (June 13, 2006): Best-selling author of book on serial killers kills himself.

==Film adaptation==
A film adaptation of the book, titled ''[[Dear Mr. Gacy]]'', was released in 2010, starring [[Jesse Moss (actor)|Jesse Moss]] (no relation) as [[Jason Moss (writer)|Jason Moss]], and [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]] as [[John Wayne Gacy]].

'''The Place''' is a [[dance]] and [[performance]] centre in Duke's Road near [[Euston railway station|Euston]] in the [[London Borough of Camden]]. It is the home of [[London Contemporary Dance School]], [[Richard Alston Dance Company]], and the Robin Howard Dance Theatre.

==History==
The building was designed by Robert Edis as the headquarters of the [[Artists Rifles|20th Middlesex (Artists) Volunteer Rifle Corps]] and built by Charles Kynoch and Company of Clapham between 1888 and 1889.&lt;ref name=blb&gt;{{cite web|author=Good Stuff |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-477148-the-place-and-attached-railings-17-camde |title=The Place and Attached Railings - Camden - Greater London - England |publisher=British Listed Buildings |date=1997-08-01 |accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently officially opened by the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref name=blb/&gt; The 20th Middlesex (Artists) Volunteer Rifle Corps became the [[London Regiment|28th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Artists Rifles)]] in 1908.&lt;ref name=step&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steppingforwardlondon.org/assets/docs/sections/17.pdf|title=Drill Hall Register: A list of the locations of London Drill Halls since 1908|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 before being deployed to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/london.htm|title=The London Regiment|publisher=The Long, Long Trail|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the London Regiment was broken up and the battalions reallocated to other units in August 1937, the hall became the home of the [[Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own)|Artists Rifles, The Rifle Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; The unit was disbanded in 1945, after the [[World War II|Second World War]], but reformed again in the Rifle Brigade in January 1947 but transferred to the [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] in July 1947 as the [[Special Air Service|21st Special Air Service Regiment (Artists Rifles)]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; The drill hall fell vacant when the 21st Special Air Service Regiment moved out to the [[Duke of York's Headquarters]] in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SCio3hI8G7wC&amp;pg=PT54&amp;lpg=PT54&amp;dq=%22Duke+of+York%27s+barracks%22+21st+Regiment+SAS&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xRpJoqlOCq&amp;sig=0EQsKgX1xE4SFDP4uZ1A03ZLXFY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9o6T9tKHUAhUJBsAKHahnAxYQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Duke%20of%20York's%20barracks%22%2021st%20Regiment%20SAS&amp;f=false|title=Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know|first=Ranulph |last=Fiennes|publisher=Hodder|year=2008|isbn=978-0340951699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drill hall, which had been colloquially known as "The Artists Place", became simply "The Place" when the Contemporary Ballet Trust took over the premises in 1969.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theplace.org.uk/history-place|title=A History of The Place|publisher=The Place|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the Contemporary Ballet Trust, under the leadership of [[Robin Howard]], acquired the freehold of the premises as well as a site in Flaxman Terrace so facilitating an extension studio block to be built.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; In the 1970s the Contemporary Ballet Trust established the [[London Contemporary Dance School]] and the [[London Contemporary Dance Theatre]] both of which were formed at The Place; in 1994 the latter body was succeeded by the [[Richard Alston Dance Company]] which remains located at The Place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcds.ac.uk/|title=London Contemporary Dance School|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1999 a major redevelopment programme, principally funded by the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]], allowed the refurbishment of the original drill hall and the replacement of the studio block with six new state-of-the-art dance studios designed by architects [[Allies and Morrison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/a-sense-of-place/184828.article|title=A Sense of Place|publisher=Architect's Journal|date=18 October 2001|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two further dance studios, the Weston Studio and the Monument Studio, were added in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcds.ac.uk/history-london-contemporary-dance-school|title=History of London Contemporary Dance School|publisher=The Place|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Claude Monet - The Seine at Argenteuil 1873.jpg|thumb|''The Seine at Argenteuil'', 1873]]
'''''The Seine at Argenteuil''''' is an 1873 oil painting by [[Claude Monet]], one of a series of paintings the artist made of the area.

The painting is held in a private collection.

==In popular culture==
''The Seine at Argenteuil'' was featured in and provided (along with other Monet paintings) the title inspiration for the 2001 film ''[[Vanilla Sky]]''. In the film the main character, David ([[Tom Cruise]]), owns the painting, and his subconscious makes use of its depiction of the sky.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32231">'''The semantic turn''' refers to a [[paradigm shift]] in the design of artifacts – [[industrial design|industrial]], [[Graphic Design|graphic]], [[Information Design|informational]], [[Architectural Design|architectural]], and [[Social design|social]] – from an emphasis on how artifacts ought to function to what they mean to those affected by them – [[semantics]] being a concern for meaning. It provides a new foundation for professional design, a detailed design discourse, codifications of proven methods, compelling scientific justifications of its products, and a clear identity for professional designers working within a network of their [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]].

The semantic turn suggests a distinction between the technical and user-irrelevant working of artifacts and the human interactions with artifacts, individually, socially, and culturally. Attending to the technical dimension of artifacts, for example, by applied scientists, mechanical or electronic engineers, and experts in economics, production, and marketing, is called technology-centered design. It addresses its subject matter in terms that ordinary users may not understand and applies design criteria users of technology do not care about. Attending to the meanings that users bring to their artifacts, how they use them and talk about them and among various stakeholders, is the domain of human-centered design. For ordinary users, the makeup and technical functioning of artifacts is mere background of what really matters to them.

A prime example for this distinction is the design of [[Human-centered computing|personal computers]]. For most people, the operations inside a computer are incomprehensible, but far from troubling because computers are designed to be experienced primarily through their interfaces. [[User interface|Human-computer interfaces]] consist of interactively rearrangeable icons, texts, and controls that users can understand in everyday terms and manipulate towards desirable ends. The design of intelligent artifacts suggests that the old adage of “form follows function” is no longer valid&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff, Klaus &amp; Butter, Reinhart (1993). Where Meanings Escape Functions. ''Design Management Journal 4'', 2, pp. 30–37.&lt;/ref&gt; – except for the simplest of tools. The semantic turn suggests that human-centered designers’ unique expertise resides in the design of human interfaces with artifacts that are meaningful, easy to use, even enjoyable to experience, be it simple kitchen implements, public service systems, architectural spaces, or information campaigns. Although an automobile should obviously function as a means of transportation, human-centered designers emphasize the [[Experience design|experiences]] of driving, [[Usability|ease of operation]], feeling of safety, including the social meanings of driving a particular automobile. As artifacts have to work within many dimensions, human-centered designers must have a sense of and be able to work with all relevant stakeholders addressing different dimensions of the artifact.

==''The Semantic Turn'': a book and its themes==
'''''The Semantic Turn''''' is also the title of a book by [[Klaus Krippendorff]],&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff, Klaus (2006). ''The Semantic Turn; A New Foundation for Design''. Boca Raton, London, New York: Taylor&amp;Francis, CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Communication at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], cybernetician, degreed designer, and researcher who has published much to advance the science for design. The subtitle of the book, ''A new Foundation for Design'', suggests a redesign of design practices in a human-centered design culture. Krippendorff takes an encompassing view of design, centering it on the meanings that artifacts acquire and what is or should be designers' primary concern.

''The Semantic Turn'' represents an evolution from "Product Semantics" by Krippendorff and Butter,&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff, Klaus &amp; Butter, Reinhart (Eds.) (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; which was defined as ''"A systematic inquiry into how people attribute meanings to artifacts and interact with them accordingly"'' and ''"a vocabulary and methodology for designing artifacts in view of the meanings they could acquire for their users and the communities of their stakeholders"''. While retaining the emphasis on meaning and on the importance of both theory and practice, ''The Semantic Turn'' extends the concerns of designers first to the new challenges of design, including the design of ever more intangible artifacts such as services, identities, interfaces, multi-user systems, projects and discourses; and second, to consider the meaning of artifacts in use, in language, in the whole life cycle of the artifact, and in an ecology of artifacts.

===Design===
For Krippendorff, design ''"brings forth what would not come naturally (...); proposes realizable artifacts to others (...) must support the lives of ideally large communities (...) and must make sense to most, ideally to all who have a stake on them"''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Design thus is intimatelly involved with the meaning that stakeholders attribute to artifacts. Designers ''"consider possible futures (...) evaluate their desirability (...) and create and work out realistic paths from the present towards desirable futures, and propose them to those that can bring a design to fruition"''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging that all design serves others, ''The Semantic Turn'' does not treat THE user as statistical fiction, but as knowledgeable stakeholders and necessary partners in human-centered design processes.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 63–65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predecessors of human-centeredness===
Krippendorff quotes the Greek philosopher Protagoras who is believed to have been the first to express human-centeredness in words by saying that ''"Man is the measure of all things, of things that are (...) and of things that are not (...)."'' Krippendorff goes on to cite the color theory of J. W. von Goethe&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich, Theodor, et al. (Ed.) (undated). Goethe. Vierzigster Teil: Zur Farbenlehre.(original 1810). Leipzig: Verlag Reclam.&lt;/ref&gt; who exposed Isaac Newton’s spectral theory of colors as epistemologically flawed by pointing out that color is the product of the human eye. Color does not exist without it. Krippendorff refers to the Italian philosopher G. Vico for opposing R. Descartes by claiming we humans know what we have constructed, made up, cognitively, materially, or socially,&lt;ref&gt;Glasersfeld, Ernst von (1995). ''Radical Constructivism; A Way of Knowing and Learning''. Washington, DC: Falmer Press.&lt;/ref&gt; to the biologists J. Uexküll for his species-specific theory of meaning&lt;ref&gt;Uexküll, Jacob von (1934/1957), ''A Stroll Through the Worlds of Animals and Men: A Picture Book of Invisible Worlds''. pp. 5–80 in C. H. Schiller (Ed.). ''Instinctive Behavior: The Development of a Modern Concept''. New York: International University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and H. Maturana and F. Varela for developing a biological foundation of cognition,&lt;ref&gt;Maturana, Humberto R. and Francisco J. Varela (1988). ''The Tree of Knowledge; The Biological Roots of Human Understanding''. Boston, MA: Shambhala.&lt;/ref&gt; to the psychologist J. J. Gibson for his conception of affordance, which acknowledges that our environment does not account for our perception, it merely affords our sensory-motor coordinations&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, James J. (1979). ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception''. Boston MA: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; or it does not; and to the anthropological linguist B. L. Whorf for his recognition that our perceptions are correlated with language, its grammar and vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Whorf, Benjamin Lee (1956), ''Language, Thought and Reality'', John B. Carroll (Ed.). New York: John Wiley and MIT.&lt;/ref&gt; Most important, Krippendorff allies himself with L. Wittgenstein’s definition of meaning as use,&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig (1953). Philosophical Investigations. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in the axiom that ''Humans do not see and act on the physical qualities of things, but on what they mean to them''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning===
Attributing meaning to something follows from sensing it, and is a prelude to action. ''" One always acts according to the meaning of whatever one faces "''&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 58&lt;/ref&gt; and the consequences of these actions in turn become part of the meanings of what one interacts with. Meanings are always someone's construction and depend on context and culture. The same artifact may invoke different meanings at different times, in different contexts of use, and for different people. To design artifacts for use by others calls on designers to understand the understanding of others, a ''second order understanding'' that is fundamentally unlike the understanding of physical things. Since meanings cannot be observed directly, designers need to carefully observe the actions that imply certain meanings; involve themselves in dialog with their stakeholders; and invite them to participate in the design process.

===Meaning of artifacts in use===
People acquire the meanings of artifacts by their interfacing with them, where meanings become anticipated usabilities. Krippendorff does not limit the concept of interfaces to human computer interactions, however. For him, the concept applies to any artifact one faces. To users, artifacts are perceived as affordances, as the kind of interactions they enable or prohibit. Thus scissors and coffee cups are experienced as interfaces, just as personal computers are. Their physical or computational makeup become background phenomena to use. The meaning of an artifact in use is then ''" the range of imaginable senses and actions that users have reasons to expect" ''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Ideal interfaces are self-evident and ''" intrinsically motivating interactions between users and their artifacts" ''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on Heidegger's explorations of the human use of technology, Krippendorff argues that all artifacts must be designed to afford three stages of use: initial recognition, intermediate exploration, and ideally, unproblematic reliance. The latter is achieved when the artifact is so incorporated into the user's world that it becomes hardly noticed, is taken for granted while looking through it to what is to be accomplished. Recognition involves users' categorizations, how close the artifact is to the ''ideal type'' of its kind. Exploration is facilitated by informatives such as state indicators, progress reports, confirmations of actions and readiness, alarm signals, close correlations between actions and their expected effects, maps of possibilities, instructions, error messages, and multi-sensory feedback. Users' intrinsic motivation arises from reliance, the seemingly effortless, unproblematic yet skillful engagement with artifacts free of disruptions. A well designed interface enables unambiguous recognition, effective exploration, and leads to enjoyable reliance. To accomplish these transitions, human-centered designers need to involve second-order understanding of users' cognitive models, cultural habits, and competencies.

Typically, users approach their artifacts with very different competencies. ''The Semantic Turn'' offers the possibility of accommodating these differences by allowing the design of several semantic layers. For example, contemporary Xerox machines exhibit one layer for making copies, another for clearing paper jams, a third for replacing defective parts by trained service personnel, and a fourth is reserved for the factory repair of replaced components.

===Meaning of artifacts in language===
''"The fate of all artifacts is decided in language" '',&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 148&lt;/ref&gt; says Krippedorff. Indeed, designers must pay attention to the narratives in which an artifact appears as soon as it enters the conversations among stakeholders, bystanders, critics, and users, to the names that categorize the artifact as being of one kind or another, and to the adjectives that direct perception to particular qualities (is it a ''fast'' car? a ''clumsy'' cell phone? a ''high class'' dress?). Such characterizations can make or break an artifact and designers cannot ignore how people talk about them. Krippendorff proposes that ''artifacts should be designed so that their interfaces are [easily] narratable''&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 147, emphasis added&lt;/ref&gt; and fit into social or communicational relationships.

The ''character'' of an artifact – the set of adjectives deemed appropriate to it – can be assessed by means of semantic differential scales – seven point scales between polar opposite attributes such as elegant––––graceless; by categorizing free associations elicited from users, whether as first impressions or after extended use; by examining the content of stories people tell about the artifacts for implied judgments; or by pair comparisons of similar artifacts. Such methods give human-centered designers ways to quantify meanings, to work towards defined design criteria, including pursuing quantifiable aesthetic objectives, and justify a design to potential stakeholders.

Language permeates all of human life, including with artifacts. This applies not only to the users of artifacts but also to their designers. The narratives that evolve within design teams determine the direction a design is taking, and might end up convincing stakeholders to go along with a design project or oppose it, well before it is built, and influence designers in turn. What we know of current artifacts, ancient ones, outdated ones, antiques or museum pieces come to us in the form of stories. Designers need to analyse them for, as Krippendorff asserts, ''" The meanings that artifacts acquire in use are largely framed in language"''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning in the lives of artifacts===
Here, Krippendorff invites designers to consider artifacts in their whole life cycle. In the case of industrial products, the life cycle might start with an initial idea, then followed by design, engineering, production, sales, use, storage, maintenance and finally retirement, as recycled or as waste. Well, not so "finally;" designers may learn much about a product's performance, unintended uses, unexpected problems, and resulting social consequences, which can serve to improve the design of the next generation of that product – design never ends. In each phase of the life cycle of an artifact, that artifact will have to support diverse but subjectively meaningful interfaces for different communities of stakeholders. In such stakeholder networks, artifacts need to proceed from one to the next: ''" no artifact can be realized within a culture without being meaningful to those who can move it through its various definitions" ''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning in an ecology of artifacts===
Dictionaries tend to define ecology as multi-species interaction in a common environment, the species being animals and plants. Humans, however, have created a perhaps greater diversity of ''species of artifacts'' than has nature. Krippendorff observes that species of artifacts too are born, grow in size and number, diversify into sub-species, associate with other species, adapt to each other and to their human environment, and either reproduce, evolve, or disappear – just as in nature. Species of artifacts may compete, cooperate or be parasitic on other artifacts. For an example of the latter, consider spam, which thrives in the email ecosystem and could not exist outside it. Whereas species of animals and plants interact with one another in their own terms, species of artifacts are brought into interaction through human agency. People arrange artifacts, like the furniture at home; connect them into networks, like computes in the internet; form large cultural cooperatives, like hospitals full of medical equipment, drugs, and treatments; retire one species in favor of another, like typewriters gave way to personal computers; or change their ecological meanings, like horses, originally used for work and transportation, found an ecological niche in sports.

In an ecology of artifacts, the meaning of one consists of the possible interactions with other artifacts: cooperation, competition (substitution), domination or submission, leading technological development, like computers do right now, supporting the leaders, like the gadgets found in computer stores. Similarly, roads and gas stations follow the development of automobiles and participate in a very large cultural complex, including the design of cities and the distribution of work, and affect nature through depletion of resources, creating waste and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Clearly, ''" designers who can handle the ecological meaning of their proposals have a better chance of keeping their designs alive" ''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Towards a science for design==
In 1969, Nobel laureate Herbert Simon called for a science of the artificial.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Herbert A. (1969/2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Natural scientists, he argued, are concerned with what exists, whereas designers are concerned with what should be and how to achieve it. His conception of design was shaped by rational decision theory and early conceptions of computational logic, hence limited largely to technology-centered design. Krippendorff added the following contrasts to Simon’s:
* The natural sciences limit themselves to theorizing past regularities from existing data. They do not see scientists as change agents. Any science for design must concern itself with how designers can change existing regularities, overcome contingencies that cause recurring problems, and make a difference in the lives of present stakeholders or future communities. Designers do not produce theories but propose unprecedented artifacts, new practices, and narratives that must be realized in a network of stakeholders, which are actors in their own interest. The science for design cannot be ''about'' design or ''of'' design, which are pursued from outside the design community. It must provide practical and intellectual support of design by being ''for'' or in the service of design activity. In support of change that does not come naturally, it must also provide the conceptualizations needed to hold designers accountable for how their proposals affect future contingencies.
* The natural sciences privilege causal explanations, which rule out that their objects can understand how they are conceptualized, theorized, and studied. A science for human-centered design privileges the meanings (conceptions, explanations, and motivations) that knowledgeable users and stakeholders of a design can bring to it. It entails a reflexive kind of understanding unfamiliar in the natural sciences.
* As detached observers of their objects, natural scientists can afford to celebrate abstract and general theories. Designers, by contrast, must be concerned with all necessary details of their design. No technology works in the abstract. Even social artifacts need to be understood and enacted by their constituents. A design is always a proposal to other stakeholders who may contribute to a design or oppose its realization. Theories in the natural sciences do not affect what they theorize, but designs must enroll others into what they are proposing, treat them as intelligent agents, or will not come to fruition.
* In the natural sciences, research consists of gathering date or objective facts in support of theories about these data. Predictive theories assume the status quo (the continuation) of the phenomena they theorize. In the science for design, research means searching for previously unrecognized variables and proposing realistic paths into desirable futures. Design, to the extent it is innovative, may well break with past theories, overcome popular convictions, and challenge stubborn beliefs in a history-determined future. Fundamentally, past observations can never prove the validity of truly innovative designs.

A science for design makes three contributions to design:

===Design research===
Generally, research is any inquiry that generates communicable knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Bruce (1995) [https://archive.org/details/TheNatureOfResearch], accessed 2009.10.15&lt;/ref&gt; Human-centered [[design research]] typically involves
* Eliciting and analyzing the narratives of problematic uses of artifacts and desirable futures, which motivate or inspire a community of potential users and stakeholders to consider changes in their lives.
* Searching for and evaluating examples of common, understandable, and attractive practices, especially from empirical domains other than the intended design, in view of their ability to serve as metaphors for new but immediately recognizable and meaningful interfaces.
* Exploring new technologies and materials that could support or improve current and future uses of the artifacts under consideration.
* Testing and evaluating alternative designs – recombinations and transformations of available technologies, possible interfaces, and social and ecological consequences – usually in terms relevant to present stakeholders and in lieu of future users.
* Inquiring into how a design survives in the ecology of artifacts, what lessons can be learned for future design activities, so called post-design research.

===Design methods===
Human-centered [[design methods]] may aim at:
* Systematic expansions of a design space – the possibilities in which a design can take place. This space should embrace and go beyond user and stakeholder expectations, especially including the (apparently) unthinkable. Such methods range from the computer generation of alternatives ([[Enumerative combinatorics|combinatorics]]) to the use of language games during which novel ideas are created, for example by [[brainstorming]].
* Focused involvement of users and stakeholders in the design process (in reducing the design space to realistic proposals for meaningful artifacts). There are three known ways:
** Acquiring an understanding of users’ and stakeholders’ understanding, so-called second-order understanding, for instance by [[Ethnography|ethnographic research]] or [[focus group]]s, and making design decisions dependent on that understanding
** Involving users and stakeholders in design decisions, for example, [[participatory design]]
** Delegating design by designing artifacts that either adapt themselves to their users’ and stakeholders’ worlds or can be redesigned by them, in personal computers, for example.
* Formalizing successful design practices into reproducible aids that can improve future design practices, both computationally, for example, [[Computer-aided design|computer aided design]], [[Computer supported cooperative work|collaborative software]], and [[rapid prototyping]], and prescriptively. Krippendorff describes five prescriptive methods:&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 230–260&lt;/ref&gt;
** (Re)designing the characters of artifacts
** Designing interfaces for artifacts in view of their usability and meanings in use
** Designing novel artifacts, including services and social practices, from sensible narratives and metaphors
** Designing design strategies
** Designing dialogical (collaborative) methodologies to involve others in a design process.
* Elaborating and refining the design discourse in order to
** Improve the reproducibility of knowledge about the design process, by generating retrievable records of past accounts of design processes and publishing pertinent findings
** Make the collaboration among designers as well as in interdisciplinary teams more efficient
** Inform pertinent design education
** Enhance the ability to ask fruitful research questions for which design research may provide conclusive answers
** Increase and maintain the reputation of professional design, especially in order for designers to play important roles within the network of its stakeholders. This means applying the science for design to itself.

===Validations of semantic claims===
In a science for design, validation consists of generating compelling justifications for the claims that designers must make regarding the meaning, virtue, potential reality, costs and benefits of their design for particular communities.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 260–267&lt;/ref&gt; Inasmuch as any design can prove itself only in the future, ''post factum'', and with the collaboration of others, human-centered design is justifiable only by means of plausible arguments [[Issue-Based Information System]]&lt;ref&gt;Rittel, Horst W. J. (1992). ''Planen, Entwerfen, Design; Ausgewȁhlte Schriften zur Theorie und Methodik ''. Wolf D. Reuter (Ed.). Stuttgart, Berlin, Kȍln: W. Kohlhammer Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rittel, Horst W. J. &amp; Webber, Melvin M.. (1984). Planning problems are wicked problems. In Cross, Nigel (Ed.). ''Developments in design methodology''. New York: Wiley, pp. 135–144.&lt;/ref&gt; that motivate its stakeholders to realize or use that design. The science for design, always concerned with not yet observable contingencies, cannot provide the simple truth claims of the kind that natural scientist aspire to for their theories. But it can provide several other human-centered ways to back the claims designers need to make:
* Convincing demonstrations and expositions of a design in various contexts of use
* Statistical experiments with prototypes, models or visualizations involving users’ ability to make sense of, find appropriate meanings for, and handle a proposed artifact
* Appeals to trusted theories or principles of how meanings of artifacts are acquired in use, can be communicated through various channels, or emerge in a diversity of social situations, including in an ecology of other artifacts
* Accounts of the systematic application of established design methods that reduced the initial design space to the alternatives being proposed
* Affirmed commitments by relevant stakeholders to realize the design.

==Reception of "product semantics" and ''The Semantic Turn''==
Since its coinage in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff, Klaus &amp; Butter, Reinhart (1984). Exploring the Symbolic Qualities of Form. ''Innovations 3'', 2 pp. 4–9. [http://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/40], accessed 2009.10.15.&lt;/ref&gt; the use of “product semantics” has mushroomed. In 2009, a Google search identified over 18,000 documents referring to it. However, it has been critiqued by advocates of a more critical approach to design as overly simplistic.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

The semantics of artifacts has become of central importance in courses taught at leading design departments of many universities all over the world, among them at the Arizona State University; the Cranbrook Academy of Arts; The Ohio State University; the Savannah College of Art and Design; the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, USA; the Hochschule fűr Gestaltung Offenbach in Germany;&lt;ref&gt;Steffen, Dagmar (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; the Hongik University in Seoul, Korea; the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai; the Musashino Art University in Tokyo, Japan; the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology; the University of Art and Design in Helsinki, Finland; and more. It has also permeated other disciplines, notably [[ergonomics]], [[marketing]], [[Cognitive ergonomics|cognitive engineering]].

'''''The World Is the Home of Love and Death: Stories''''' is a collection of [[short stories]] written by [[Harold Brodkey]] and first published [[Posthumous work|posthumously]] in 1997. Most of the stories were written to be part of his novel ''[[The Runaway Soul]]'' and concern its characters. Four of the eleven stories ("The Bullies", "Spring Fugue", "What I Do for Money", and "Dumbness is Everything") were originally printed in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and one ("Religion") in ''[[Glimmer Train]]'', from 1986 to 1996. The ''Runaway Soul'' stories are from the perspective of that novel's protagonist, Wiley Silenowicz. They detail his life from infancy, as a deathly ill child separated from his biological mother; through his childhood, living with stepparents Lila and S.L. and sister Nonie; adolescence, caring for the dying S.L.; and finally into adulthood, where he finds acceptance from the artistic community for his exceptional writing talents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4101">[[Image:Bogolubskaya ikona.jpg|thumb|The Bogolubskaya Icon of the Theotokos, 12th century (Vladimir-Suzdal Museum).]] 
The '''Bogolubovo Icon''' is a [[Wonderworking]] [[Icon]] of the [[Theotokos]] [[Agiosoritissa]] which is [[venerated]] in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. The icon was painted in the 1157 at the request of [[Grand Prince]] [[Andrew Bogolubsky]], in commemoration of an [[Marian apparitions|appearance]] to him by the [[Mother of God]]. 

According to [[Sacred Tradition|Orthodox tradition]], when the prince was moving from [[Vyshhorod|Vyshgorod]] to the [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Suzdal Principality]] in 1155, he took the Wonderworking Icon of the Theotokos from the [[Mezhyhirskyi Monastery]] in Vyshgorod with him, and served [[moleben]]s in front of it every day. About 11 [[verst]]s (7.26 miles) from the city of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], as they approached the shore of the [[Klyazma River]], the horses carrying the icon suddenly stopped and would not move forward. After prayer, the prince went to his tent and there the Theotokos appeared to him in a dream-like vision holding a scroll in her right hand, and commanded him to place her icon in the city of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] and to build a [[temple]] (church) and [[monastery]] on the place of the vision. (Ever since this time, that icon has been known as [[Our Lady of Vladimir]].) Great Prince Andrew did as he was told, and also commissioned the Bogolubsky Icon of the Theotokos.

[[Image:Bogolyubskaya ikona s Zosimoy i Savvatiem.jpg|thumb|left|The Bogolubskaya Icon of the Theotokos with Ss. Zosimus and Sabbatius ([[Old Believer]] oratory at Volkov cemetery, [[St. Petersburg]]).]]

On the icon, the Theotokos is depicted in full stature, holding a scroll in her right hand. Her left hand is [[orans|turned in prayer]] to [[Jesus Christ]], who is depicted in an [[aureole]] in the upper-right hand corner. Prince Andrew himself is depicted in a prayerful stance on his knees before the Theotokos. In variations of the icon, other saints may appear at the feet of the Virgin, such as saints [http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?SID=4&amp;ID=1&amp;FSID=101130 Zosimus] and [[Savvatiy|Sabbatius]] of [[Solovetsky Monastery|Solovki]].

The icon came to be named after Prince Andrew Bogoliubsky ("Lover of God") and was placed in the monastery he built.

The church prince Andrew built was [[consecrated]] in honor of the [[Great Feast]] of the [[Nativity of the Theotokos]], and the icon he commissioned was placed there. The monastery he built has come to be known as Bogolubsky [[Convent]], and the town which grew up around it was called Bogolubovo. The icon of Our Lady of Vladimir remained in the convent while work was completed on the [[Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir|Dormition Cathedral]] in Vladimir, after which it was solemly [[translation (relics)|translated]] to the cathedral.

In 1771 a [[feast day]] was established in honor of the Bogolubskaya icon and in memory of the deliverance of the city of Vladimir and its vicinity from [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. The feast day is June 18 (for those churches which use the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], June 18 currently falls on July 1 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). Before the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] the icon was brought annually on May 21 (June 3) to the city Vladimir where it remained until July 16 (July 29), when it was returned from there to the monastery.

The original Bogolubskaya icon is kept in the [[Knyaginin Convent]] of Vladimir, but over the centuries numerous copies of the icon have been made, and it continues to be venerated in many churches both in [[Russia]] and throughout the world.

Throughout Africa, Europe, and Asia [[Flint tool|flint arrowheads and axes]] turned up by farmer's plows were considered to have fallen from the sky. They were often thought to be [[thunderbolt]]s and are called '''"thunderstones"'''. It was not until travelers returned from far-away places where these implements were in [[Primitive culture|actual use]] that the origins of these objects became known. Even then, these travelers' tales received little popular credence.&lt;ref name="Leach"&gt;Leach, Maria. ""Flint"." Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology, and Legend. 3rd ed.

==Thunderstone folklore==
[[File:HMB Steinaxtmanufaktur Vinelz Jungsteinzeit 2700 BC.jpg|thumb|Axe heads found at a 2700 BC Neolithic manufacture site in Switzerland, arranged in the various stages of production from left to right.]]
In [[Scandinavian mythology|Scandinavia]] thunderstones were frequently worshiped as [[Household deity|family gods]] who kept off spells and witchcraft. [[Beer]] was poured over them as an offering and they were sometimes anointed with butter. In [[Switzerland]] the owner of a thunderstone whirls it, on the end of a thong, three times round his head, and throws it at the door of his dwelling at the approach of a storm to prevent [[Lightning strike|lightning from striking the house]]. In Italy they are hung around children's necks to protect them from illness and to ward off the [[Evil eye]]. In Roman times they were sewn inside dog-collars along with a little piece of [[coral]] to keep the dogs from going mad. In Sweden they offer protection from [[Elf|elves]]. In the [[French Alps]] they protect sheep, while elsewhere in France they are thought to ease [[childbirth]]. In Burma they are used as a cure and preventative for [[appendicitis]]. In Japan they cure boils and ulcers. In Malay and Sumatra they are used to sharpen the [[kris]], are considered very lucky objects, and are credited with being [[Touchstone (assaying tool)|touchstones]] for gold. Among the Slavs they cure warts on man and beast, and during [[Passion Week]] they have the property to reveal hidden [[treasure]].&lt;ref name="Leach"/&gt;

===Further examples of thunderstone folklore===
[[Image:Bifaz de Atapuerca (TG10).jpg|thumb|left|Picture of two [[Lower Paleolithic]] [[biface]]s]]
In the [[British Isles]] some idea of their original use is retained, and they are often referred to variously as elf arrows, elf bolts, elf darts, or fairy arrows, and are said to have been shot by elves or [[fairies]] at a person or animal to bewitch them. On the other hand, they are thought, for the most part, to protect the possessor from these little people. The presence of flint instruments found in British [[cinerary urn]]s of the [[Roman Britain|Roman Era]] is explained by two theories: 1) they were used by the [[mourner]]s to lacerate themselves; 2) flints (like all fire-producing stones) are potent magic for preventing the [[Haunted house|return of the dead.]] In Ireland flint stones are soaked in water to make a medicine which is good for man or beast. Mounted in silver they are worn as protection against [[elf-shot]], i.e. elf- or fairy-inflicted disease.
In North Carolina and Alabama there is a belief that flint stones placed in the fire will keep hawks from molesting the chickens, a belief which probably stems from the European idea that elf arrows protect domestic animals. In Brazil, flint is used as a divining stone for gold, treasure and water.&lt;ref name="Leach"/&gt; 

During the [[Middle Ages]] many of these well-wrought stones were venerated as weapons, which during the "war in heaven" had been used in driving forth Satan and his hosts; hence, in the 11th century the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] sent to the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman emperor]] a "heaven axe"; and in the 12th century a [[Bishop of Rennes]] asserted the value of thunderstones as a divinely appointed means of securing success in battle, safety on the sea, security against thunder, and immunity from unpleasant dreams. 
Even as late as the 17th century, a French ambassador brought a stone hatchet, which still exists in the museum at [[Musée de l'École de Nancy|Nancy]], as a present to the Prince-Bishop of Verdun, and claimed that it had healing properties.&lt;ref name="McNamara"/&gt;

===Native American thunderstone folklore===
The flint was an object of veneration by most American Indian tribes. According to the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] [[Origin myth]], stone weapons and implements were given to man by the [[Pawnee mythology|Morning Star]]. Among the [[K'iche' people]] of Guatemala, there is a myth that a flint fell from the sky and broke into 1600 pieces, each of which became a god. [[Tohil]], the God who gave them fire, is still represented as flint. This myth provides a parallel to the almost universal belief in the thunderstone, and reminds us that [[Jupiter (mythology)]] was once worshipped in the form of a flint stone. The [[Cherokee]] [[shaman]] invokes a flint when he is about to [[scarify]] a patient prior to applying his medicine. Among the [[Pueblos]] we have the Flint Societies which, in most tribes, were primarily concerned with weather and witchcraft, but sometimes had to do with war and medicine.&lt;ref name="Leach"/&gt;

===Fossil echinoids as thunderstones===
In many parts of southern England until the middle of the nineteenth century, another name commonly used for fossil [[Echinoid]]s was 'thunderstone'. This was a name that in all likelihood formed part of another folk tradition that was almost certainly brought to Britain by [[Denmark|Danish]] and [[Anglo-Saxon]] invaders more than 1500 years ago. In 1677 [[Robert Plot|Dr. Robert Plot]], the first keeper of the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford University|Oxford]], published his classic book ''The Natural History of Oxfordshire''. Plot recorded that in [[Oxfordshire]] what we now call fossil echinoids were called thunderstones, as they were thought to have descended from the heavens during a thunderstorm. 
The St. Peter's Church in [[Linkenholt]], England, was built in 1871 near the location of the old St. Peter's, which had stood for nearly 700 years. The 1871 version of the church included fossil echinoids built into the walls surrounding the windows, a style adopted from the original. This implies that Thunderstone folklore was retained for at least 700 years in England, and had its roots in [[pagan]] folklore.&lt;ref name="McNamara"&gt;McNanamara, Kenneth. (2007). Shepards' crowns, fairy loaves and thunderstones: the mythology of fossil echinoids in England. Myth and Geology, (273), 289-293.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of thunderstone mythology==
[[File:Boucher de Perthes.jpg|thumb|right|Boucher de Perthes]]
[[Andrew Dickson White]] described the discovery of the true origin of thunderstones as a "line of observation and thought ... fatal to the theological view". In the last years of the sixteenth century [[Michael Mercati]] tried to prove that the "thunder-stones" were weapons or implements of early races of men; but for some reason his book was not published until the following century, when other thinkers had begun to take up the same idea. In 1723 [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu]] addressed the French Academy on "The Origin and Uses of Thunder-stones". He showed that recent travellers from various parts of the world had brought a number of weapons and other implements of stone to France, and that they were essentially similar to what in Europe had been known as "thunderstones". A year later this fact was firmly embedded in the minds of French scientists by the Jesuit [[Lafitau, Joseph-Francois|Joseph-Francois Lafitau]], who published a work showing the similarity between the customs of aborigines then existing in other lands and those of the early inhabitants of Europe. So began, in these works of Jussieu and Lafitau, the science of [[ethnology]]. It was more than 100 years later, after the [[French Revolution of 1830]], that the political climate in Europe was free enough of religious sentiment for archaeological discoveries to be dispassionately investigated and the conclusion reached that human existence spanned a much greater period of time than any Christian theologian had dreamt of.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White, Andrew D. [[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]. New York: George Braziller, 1955. 266-283&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boucher de Perthes===
In 1847, a man previously unknown to the world at large, [[Jacques Boucher de Crèvecœur de Perthes|Boucher de Perthes]], published in Paris the first volume of work on ''Celtic and Antediluvian Antiquities'', and in this he showed engravings of typical flint implements and weapons, of which he had discovered thousands upon thousands in the high drift beds near Abbeville, in northern France. So far as France was concerned, he was met at first by what he calls "a conspiracy of silence", and then by a contemptuous opposition among orthodox scientists, led by [[Jean-Baptiste Élie de Beaumont|Elie de Beaumont]]. 

In 1863 the thunderstone myth was further discredited by [[Charles Lyell]] in his book ''[[Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man]]''. Lyell had previously opposed the new ideas about [[human antiquity]], and his changing sides gave further force to the scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;

}}The '''Tivoli Theatre''', is a theatre in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]], opened in 1872 as '''Her Majesty's Theatre''' and was built by the ''Aberdeen Theatre and Opera House Company Ltd'', under architects James Matthews of Aberdeen and C.B. Phipps, a [[London]]-based architect brought in to consult. The auditorium was rebuilt in 1897 by theatre architect [[Frank Matcham]], but then closed temporarily in 1906, following the opening of the larger [[His Majesty's Theatre, Aberdeen|His Majesty's Theatre]]. The smaller theatre was extensively reconstructed in 1909, again by Frank Matcham, and re-opened in July 1910 as the Tivoli. The Tivoli was refurbished again in 1938.
[[File:The Tivoil, Guild St, Aberdeen, Scotland.JPG|thumb|left|The Tivoil, Guild St, Aberdeen, Scotland]]
The theatre became a bingo hall in 1966. In the mid 1980s plans were made to improve the bingo-oriented facilities and the building, but little was actually done. The building finally closed for bingo in 1998 and became disused.

From 2000, The building had been in private hands, and attempts by the Tivoli Theatre Trust to purchase the building were unsuccessful, {{As of|2006|lc=on}}. In April 2006, some cosmetic preservative work was observed at the building.

On 10 July 2009, the owner of the Tivoli Theatre decided to sell the property to Mr Brian Hendry. On 16 July 2009 during a meeting with the Aberdeen Tivoli Theatre Trust,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aberdeentivoli.net/&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Hendry outlined his intention to operate the Tivoli Theatre on a profit-making basis as a mid-scale venue with ancillary facilities, through the Tivoli Theatre Company Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aberdeentivoli.net/fileadmin/forms/Position_Statement.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722154437/http://www.aberdeentivoli.net/fileadmin/forms/Position_Statement.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was restored. The reopening was funded by many businesses.

The Tivoli was listed on the [[Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buildingsatrisk.org.uk/search/keyword/tivoli/event_id/899555/building_name/tivoli-theatre-1-trinity-street-guild-street-aberdeen |title=Tivoli Theatre |work=Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland |accessdate=28 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131028133341/http://www.buildingsatrisk.org.uk/search/keyword/tivoli/event_id/899555/building_name/tivoli-theatre-1-trinity-street-guild-street-aberdeen |archivedate=28 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 April 2012, it was announced that the Theatre had been made wind and watertight and that its frontage had been brought back to its former glory. The next phase of the restoration was set to bring the interior up to 21st century standards, including a 450-seat auditorium, a cafe and a gallery.

The theatre reopened on 25 October 2013 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/3440927&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/lifestyle/entertainment/theatre/flaming-good-launch-for-tivoli-1.145278 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212235359/http://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/lifestyle/entertainment/theatre/flaming-good-launch-for-tivoli-1.145278 |archivedate=12 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Inferno (play)|''Inferno'']], an original play by [[Thomas Bywater]] which ran from 25–27 October 2013. On 7 December 2013 Attic theatre's production of ''Robin Hood and The Babes In The Wood'' became the first [[Pantomime]] at the theatre in 50 years and was followed by Sleeping Beauty in 2014 and Dick Whittington in 2015.  Attic return in 2016 with Aladdin. Joseph Purdy Productions became the first UK touring pantomime to visit the Tivoli in July 2018 with Rapunzel.&lt;ref&gt;https://thetivolitheatre.com/events/rapunzel/&lt;/ref&gt;  All three levels of the theatre are now open.
 
==Predecessors==
A plaque erected by Aberdeen City Council at Theatre Lane states:
''"In 1795 the Theatre Royal, seating 600, was created in Marischal Street by [[Stephen Kemble]], brother of the actor [[John Philip Kemble]]. Eminent performers included Charles Macready and Charles Keen. The theatre flourished until 1872 when it was replaced by Her Majesty's Opera House, later the Tivoli, in Guild Street."''

'''Tudric''' is a brand name for [[pewter]]ware made by W.H. Haseler's of Birmingham for [[Liberty &amp; Co]] of London, the chief (possibly only) designer being [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]].  The gold and silver ranges were known as Cymric (pro: Koomric).  Liberty &amp; Co began producing Tudric in 1899, and continued to the 1930s.  The designs use [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Celtic Revival]] styles, and remain popular with collectors.

The Tudric Pewter became known as poor man's silver due to its shine, which was achieved by removing the lead content and adding a small percentage of silver.
