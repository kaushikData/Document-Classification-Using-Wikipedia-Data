[[File:1886 Revelation.jpg|thumb|left|Facsimile of [[John Taylor (Latter Day Saints)|John Taylor]]'s handwritten revelation]]
In the [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalist movement]], the '''1886 Revelation''' is the text of a [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] said to have been received by [[John Taylor (Latter Day Saints)|John Taylor]], third [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), that is claimed to restate the permanence of the principle of [[plural marriage]]. Along with [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]]'s 1843 revelation on plural marriage,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/132 Doctrine and Covenants section 132].&lt;/ref&gt; the 1886 revelation is one of the primary documents used by Mormon fundamentalists to justify their continued practice of [[Polygyny|polygamy]]. The LDS Church, which issued manifestos in [[1890 Manifesto|1890]] and [[Second Manifesto|1904]] to terminate the practice of plural marriage, does not accept the 1886 revelation as authentic.&lt;ref&gt;In an “Official Statement” from the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] of the LDS Church, signed by [[Heber J. Grant]], [[Anthony W. Ivins|A.W. Ivins]] and [[J. Reuben Clark, Jr.]], it states: “It is alleged that on September 26-27, 1886, President John Taylor received a revelation from the Lord, the purported text is given in publications circulated apparently by or at the instance of this organization (Fundamentalists). As to this pretended revelation it should be said that the archives of the Church contain no such a revelation; the archives contain no record of any such a revelation, nor any evidence justifying a belief that any such a revelation was ever given. From the personal knowledge of some of us, from the uniform and common recollection of the presiding quorums of the Church, from the absence in the Church archives of any evidence whatsoever justifying any belief that such a revelation was given, we are justified in affirming that no such a revelation exists.”&lt;/ref&gt; Others have questioned whether the revelation, if authentic, even refers to plural marriage or its continuance.&lt;ref name = Qs/&gt;

In 1911, [[John W. Taylor (Mormon)|John W. Taylor]], Taylor's son and an [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]]  claimed that he had discovered the revelation among his father's papers after his death in 1887. Unfortunately, his was a copy written in his own hand.&lt;ref name=Qs&gt;[http://www.mormonfundamentalism.com/questions_concerning_the_1887.htm Questions concerning the 1886 revelation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610001852/https://www.mormonfundamentalism.com/questions_concerning_the_1887.htm |date=2008-06-10 }}, mormonfundamentalism.com, accessed 2008-05-22.{{Unreliable source|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of the original document exist,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artbulla.com/images/1886.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; but the document itself is not extant.&lt;ref name = Qs/&gt; Examinations of the photographs have suggested that the document is in John Taylor's handwriting.&lt;ref name = Qs/&gt; In 1912, [[Lorin C. Woolley]], a Mormon fundamentalist leader, published a claim that five copies of the revelation had been made and entrusted to LDS Church apostle [[George Q. Cannon]] (and four other men who were not LDS Church officials) with the intent of preserving it for posterity.&lt;ref name = Qs/&gt; 

The text of the revelation is as follows:

::''1886 Revelation'' 
::''Given to President John Taylor September 27, 1886''
::''My son John, you have asked me concerning the New and Everlasting Covenant how far it is binding upon my people.''

::''Thus saith the Lord: All commandments that I give must be obeyed by those calling themselves by my name unless they are revoked by me or by my authority, and how can I revoke an everlasting covenant, for I the Lord am everlasting and my everlasting covenants cannot be abrogated nor done away with, but they stand forever.'' 

::''Have I not given my word in great plainness on this subject? Yet have not great numbers of my people been negligent in the observance of my law and the keeping of my commandments, and yet have I borne with them these many years; and this because of their weakness—because of the perilous times, and furthermore, it is more pleasing to me that men should use their free agency in regard to these matters. Nevertheless, I the Lord do not change and my word and my covenants and my law do not, and as I have heretofore said by my servant Joseph: All those who would enter into my glory must and shall obey my law. And have I not commanded men that if they were Abraham’s seed and would enter into my glory, they must do the works of Abraham. I have not revoked this law, nor will I, for it is everlasting, and those who will enter into my glory must obey the conditions thereof; even so, Amen.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fldstruth.com/sysmenu.php?MParent=HISTORY&amp;MIndex=0 1886 Revelation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503030422/https://www.fldstruth.com/sysmenu.php?MParent=HISTORY&amp;MIndex=0 |date=2008-05-03 }}, fldstruth.com, accessed 2008-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''32nd [[Sikh]] Pioneers''' was a regiment of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] during British rule. The regiment was founded in 1857 as the ''Punjab Sappers (Pioneers)''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armyunits/indianinfantry/32ndpioneers.htm British Empire: Armed Forces: Units: Indian Infantry: 32nd Sikh Pioneers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
After a series of names changes, it became the ''32nd Punjab Pioneers'' in 1901 and the ''32nd Sikh Pioneers'' in 1903. To honour the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to Indian they took part in the [[Rawalpindi Parade 1905]]. In 1922, it united with [[23rd Sikh Pioneers]] and [[34th Sikh Pioneers]], to form 2nd Bn, [[3rd Sikh Pioneers]]. Their most celebrated feat of arms was the relief in 1895 of the besieged British garrison of Chitral, by a gruelling crossing of the snow-covered Shandur Pass.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3189">'''Ahitub''' ({{Lang-he|אֲחִיטוּב}} ''’Ǎḥiṭūḇ'', "my brother is goodness") A few people in the Bible have this name:

(1.) The son of [[Hophni and Phinehas|Phinehas]], grandson of [[Eli (Judges)|Eli]], and brother of [[Ichabod]]. On the death of his grandfather Eli he most likely succeeded to the office of high priest, and would have been succeeded by his son [[Ahijah]] (references to Ahitub as the father of Ahijah are in 1 Sam. 14:3; 22:9, 11, 12, 20 and 1 Chr 9:11). [[Ahijah]] (also spelled Ahiah), who is listed as his son in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2014:2-3,%2018-19;&amp;version=9; 1 Samuel 14:2-3, 18-19], may have been the same person as [[Ahimelech]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2022:9-20;&amp;version=9; 1 Samuel 22:9-20]), or he may have been another son of Ahitub (probably an elder son if this was the case).

{{s-bef|before=[[Eli (Bible)|Eli]]}}
{{s-ttl|title=[[List of High Priests of Israel|High Priest of Israel]]}}
{{s-aft|after=[[Ahijah]]}}
{{s-end}}

(2.) The father of [[Zadok (High Priest)|Zadok]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Sam.%208:15-17;&amp;version=9; 2 Sam. 8:15-17]). This Ahitub was the son of Amariah, Amarias or Arophaeus, who was the son of Meraioth, Meraoith or Merahoth, who was the son of Zerahiah or Zaraias, who was the son of [[Uzzi]], who was the son of [[Bukki]], who was the son of [[Abishua]], who was the son of [[Phinehas]], who was the son of [[Eleazar]], who was the son of [[Aaron]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Chronicles%206:3-8;&amp;version=9; 1 Chronicles 6:3-8]). There is a faint possibility that this Ahitub was made high priest by [[Saul the King|Saul]] after the extermination of the family of [[Ahimelech]], but it is very unlikely as there are apparently no references supporting this. It is much more likely that Saul had no official high priest after this incident until the end of his reign (see Josephus's [http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=2359&amp;pageno=193 Antiquities of the Jews, Book VI, Chapter XII, Paragraph 7].

(3.) A priestly descendant through the priestly line of the first [[Zadok (High Priest)|Zadok]]. This Ahitub is mentioned in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Chronicles%206:11-12;&amp;version=9; 1 Chronicles 6:11-12]. To make matters a bit more confusing, this Ahitub also had a son (or probably grandson) by the name of Zadok. This Ahitub may have been high priest in the later time of the kings, but he also may not have been a high priest. He did become the ancestor of later high priests, which served during the fall of [[Jerusalem]] and post-exile.

(4.) An ancestor of a person mentioned in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=16&amp;chapter=11&amp;verse=11&amp;version=9&amp;context=verse Nehemiah 11:11]. This person might be one of the three aforementioned persons, but probably is not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1769">'''Anqi Sheng''' ({{zh|c=安期生|w=An-ch’i Shêng}}) was a [[xian (Taoism)|Chinese immortal]] and wizard, said to be already over 1,000 years old at the time of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first emperor. 

He was said to inhabit [[Mount Penglai]]. Anqi appears to have been a Taoist wizard, and was able to render himself visible or invisible at his pleasure. According to the [[Daoist]] [[hagiography]] ''[[Liexian Zhuan]]'', Qin Shi Huang spoke with him for three entire days (including nights), and offered Anqi jade and gold. Qin Shi Huang feared death, and sought immortality, without success. In 219 BC, he sent an expedition under [[Xu Fu]] to find Anqi and to bring him back, along with the [[elixir of life]], which grants immortality or eternal youth. When Xu Fu reported that a sea creature blocked the expedition's path, Qin Shi Huang sent archers to kill it. In 210 BC, Xu Fu continued his journey. Legend says he found [[Japan]] instead, proclaimed himself king, and never returned. The ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' state that [[Li Shaojun]] visited Anqi Sheng during his travels. There is no record, however, of where they met or of Mount Penglai itself. In 130 BC, [[Emperor Wu of Han]] also sent an expedition to find Anqi, which proved unsuccessful.

The location of Mount Penglai, and the existence of Anqi Sheng, are still debated by scholars.

Anqi holds an important place in the Taiqing and [[Shangqing School]]s.

The '''Bahá'í Faith in Mozambique''' begins after the mention of Africa in [[Bahá'í literature]] when [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] suggested it as a place to take the religion to in 1916.&lt;ref name="tablets"&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá | origyear = 1916-17 |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-6.html |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first know Bahá'í to enter the region was in 1951-52 at [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] when a British [[Bahá'í pioneering|pioneer]] came through on the way to what was then Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="BN254"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Notes from "Africa News" |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1952 | number = 254 | page =8 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#19 | title = The Bahá'í Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953-1963| author = Compiled by [[Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land | pages = 10, 103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mozambique Bahá'í community participated in successive stages of regional organization across southern Africa from 1956&lt;ref name="SA-statement"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of South Africa |title=Bahá'ís in South Africa - Progress of the Bahá'í Faith in South Africa since 1911 |work=Official Website |publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of South Africa |year=1997 |url=http://www.bahai.org.za/cm/node/19 |accessdate=2008-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408202119/http://www.bahai.org.za/cm/node/19 |archivedate=8 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; through the election of its first Mozambique Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] by 1963&lt;ref name="stats" /&gt; and on to its own [[National Spiritual Assembly]] was elected in 1987.&lt;ref name="BN654"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Mozambique |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1985 | number = 654 |ISSN=0195-9212 | page =11 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1984 the Bahá'ís have begun to hold development projects.&lt;ref name="BN660"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Social/economic development - Number of projects growing rapidly; (section mentioning Mozambique) |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1986 | number = 660 |ISSN=0195-9212 | page =5 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimated just over 2,800 Bahá'ís in 2005.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005) | work = QuickLists &gt; Compare Nations &gt; Religions &gt; | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Phase ==

In a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] in 1916-1917 by `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, asked the followers of the religion to travel to regions of Africa; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].&lt;ref name="tablets" /&gt; The publication was delayed until 1919 in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919. after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url =http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Establishment of the community ===

Probably the first Bahá'ís to enter the region were Eric and Terry Manton who landed in 1951-2 at [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], a port of Mozambique, who came from Britain to be the first [[Bahá'í pioneering|pioneers]] to what was then Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="BN254" /&gt;

In 1953 [[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, planned an international teaching plan termed the [[Ten Year Crusade]].&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; This was during a period of wide scale growth in the religion across [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] near the end of the period of [[Colonisation of Africa]].&lt;ref name="UofC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview Of World Religions |work=General Essay on the Religions of Sub-Saharan Africa |publisher=Division of Religion and Philosophy, [[University of Cumbria]] |url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sub/geness.html |accessdate=2008-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209082606/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sub/geness.html |archivedate=2007-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1956 the [[Bahá'í Faith]] was present in small numbers across 15 countries of southern Africa. To administer these communities a regional National Spiritual Assembly was elected in South West Africa to cover them.&lt;ref name="SA-statement" /&gt; Its region included South Africa, Mauritius, Reunion Island, St Helena, Bechuanaland, Basutoland, Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Madagascar, Mozambique, South-West Africa, Angola, Zululand and Swaziland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/asia-pacific/country%20files/africa.htm Africa] This note concerns references to Africa in the Bahá'í Writings&lt;/ref&gt;

Another known early pioneer was Charlotte Pinto who attended a national convention of the Bahá'ís of the United States on return from Mozambique in April 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Forty-Ninth Annual Convention, Stirred by Guardian's Appeal, Stimulates Renewed Dedication to Tasks and Ideals of Faith; Other Pioneers (section mentioning Mozambique) |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1957 | number = 316 | page =20 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1963 a summary of the state of the world wide community mentions the state in Mozambique as:&lt;ref name="stats" /&gt;

* Assemblies in [[Chi Hambanine]](?) and Lourenço Marques (now [[Maputo]]).
* Registered Groups of Bahá'ís in [[Inhambane]], Malvernia (now [[Chicualacuala]]), and [[Matola]].
* Isolated individual Bahá'ís were known in [[Mocuba]], and [[Quelimane]].

== Growth ==

Following the death of Shoghi Effendi, the elected [[Universal House of Justice]] was head of the religion and began to re-organized the Bahá'í communities of Africa, by splitting off national communities to form their own National Assemblies from 1964 though the 1990s.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of South Africa |title=Bahá'ís in South Africa - Progress of the Bahá'í Faith in South Africa since 1911 |work=Official Website |publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of South Africa |year=1997 |url=http://www.bahai.org.za/cm/node/19 |accessdate=2008-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408202119/http://www.bahai.org.za/cm/node/19 |archivedate=8 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 the regional assembly of South and West Africa had some 3,600 Bahá'ís and 36 local assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = National Assembly marks silver jubilee |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1981 | number = 608 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=8–10 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However none of the Bahá'ís from Mozambique were able to get passports to travel to Swaziland where the convention was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = South and West Africa Convention Accepts New Challenges |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1964 | number = 401 | page =6| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1967 the Bahá'í communities of several countries were re-organized away from the South and West Africa. From then Mozambique shared a regional national assembly with Swaziland and Lesotho&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Swaziland, Lesotho, and Mozambique National Assembly Formed |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1967 | number = 440 | page =10| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; which by then had about 2500 Bahá'ís and 23 Assemblies.&lt;ref name="BN608"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; South Africa - National Assembly marks silver Jubilee |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1981 | number = 608 | ISSN=0195-9212|pages=8–10| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this inaugural convention Rudolfo Duna from Mozambique was able to attend the convention in Swaziland. A regional conference held at [[Maputo]] in 1969, was conducted by the Goals Committee of Mozambique, with people coming from [[Boane District|Boane]], Machava (see [[Estádio da Machava]]), and [[Matola]].&lt;ref name="BN463"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Mozambique Baha'is Hold Conference |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1969 | number = 463 | page =8 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1969 members of the local assembly of Lourenço Marques, later named [[Maputo]], were: Rafael Mafuana, Jose Rodrigues, Rudoljo Duna, Justino Moreira, Fernanda Moreira, Rosie Mary, Emilia Rodrigues, Angelica Duna and Hagar Langa. This regional national assembly continued into 1970&lt;ref name="MacEoin"&gt;{{cite web | last = MacEoin | first = Denis |author2=Collins, William | title = Consolidation | work = The Babi and Baha'i Religions: An Annotated Bibliography | publisher = Greenwood Press's ongoing series of Bibliographies and Indexes in Religious Studies | url =http://bahai-library.com/books/biblio/consolidation.html | accessdate = 2010-01-30 | page = 165}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1971 Lesotho formed its own national assembly.&lt;ref name="BN608" /&gt;

At the April 1972 inaugural convention of regional assembly of Swaziland and Mozambique the first sizable delegation from Mozambique had been able to attend – six attended - and they announced that translations into [[Makhuwa language]] had been accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Convention of Swaziland and Mozambique |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1972 | number = 497 | page =16 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1972 members of the Swaziland and Mozambique national assembly were Jacob Mdiuli, John Allen, Benjamin Dlamini, Charles Ducker, Charles Caprez, Valera Allen, Margaret Shongwe, Ruth Dlamini, Angelica Duna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Members of the National Spiritual Assembly of Swaziland and Mozambique… |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1972 | number = 497 | page =17 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in later 1972 the first [[Hand of the Cause]] of the Bahá'í Faith visited Mozambique. [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]] traveled through Mozambique as part of a tour of many African countries. However she was only able to spend one night there where she met with a few of the Portuguese Bahá'ís for an informal social evening in the lobby of the hotel she was staying at as there were restrictions on holding meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The Great Safari of the Hand of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khánum; part eighteen |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1973 | number = 497 |pages=18–23 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her trip, a Bahá'í in jail in Mozambique made some rings for members of the [[Universal House of Justice]] and Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khanum which reached her while she was at the dedication for the [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in [[Bahá'í Faith in Panama|Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = A very Special Gift - The Hand of the Cause Amatu'l-Bahá Rúhíyyih Khánum tells how an inexpensive ring was transformed into a $100,000 donation to India's House of Worship |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1978 | number = 564 |pages=6–7 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; She offered the ring for sale to raise money for the next temple to be built. In response a Hawaiian was moved to offer a emerald he had acquired and set in a gold setting. That ring was delivered to help raise funds and arrived among the Persian Bahá'í community where it raised many thousands more. From the original ring through the end the rings raised over $100,000 for the [[Lotus Temple]] in [[Bahá'í Faith in India|India]].

In 1973-4 Mozambique was among the national communities that responded to a survey on status of women in the community which was tabulated and summarized for the 1974 Statement to the 25th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = | last = | author-link = Bahá'í International Community | contribution = Elimination of Discrimination Against Women | contribution-url =http://www.bic.org/statements-and-reports/bic-statements/74-0115.htm | title = Item 4 (A) of the provisional agenda: international instruments and national standards relating to the status of women: implementation of the Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and related instruments | date = 1974-01-14 | place = New York, USA | publisher = Bahá'í International Community | url = | doi =| id = BIC Document #74-0115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1976 Angola was added to the regional assembly with Mozambique and Swaziland.&lt;ref name="BN608" /&gt; In 1976 a compilation of prayers in the [[Yao language]], a language spoken in Mozambique and countries to the north, was published through the regional national assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Prayers published in Chiyao language |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1976 | number = 544 | page =15 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; From December 1976 refugees from the [[Mozambican Civil War]] who returned to Portugal also had contact with the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Portugal; Musical proclamation held|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1976 | number = 544 | page =6 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Portugal; Minority group opened to Faith|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1976 | number = 544 | page =16 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Portugal; Covilhå Assembly formed|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1978 | number = 564 | page =12 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 Swaziland elected their own national assembly and Angola and Mozambique continued with a shared assembly.&lt;ref name="BN608" /&gt; From 1978 to 1992 Angola and Mozambique shared a regional national assembly. In 1985 the Bahá'ís of Mozambique elected their first [[National Spiritual Assembly]], witnessed by [[Institution of the Counsellors|Continental Counselor]] Shidan Fat'he-Aazam.&lt;ref name="BN654" /&gt;

=== Development projects begin ===

Since its inception the religion has had involvement in [[socio-economic development]] beginning by giving greater freedom to women,&lt;ref name="iranhistory"&gt;{{cite web | last = Momen | first = Moojan | title = History of the Baha'i Faith in Iran | work = draft "A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith" | publisher = Bahai-library.com | url =http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_iran#9.%20Social%20and%20economic%20development | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kingdon | first = Geeta Gandhi | title = Education of women and socio-economic development | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 1997 | url =http://bahai-library.com/kingdon_education_women_development }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.&lt;ref name="iranhistory" /&gt; The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the [[Universal House of Justice]] dated 20 October 1983 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen |author2=Smith, Peter | year = 1989 | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988 |volume = 19 | journal = Religion | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the [[Bahá'í teachings]], in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In 1984 an agricultural project near Matola Rio with youth helping the community to cultivate the land around the Baha'i Center.&lt;ref name="BN660" /&gt; In 1995 Bahá'ís gathered with others to form a ''Forum of Religions'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = compiled by Wagner | first = Ralph D. | title = Mozambique | work = Synopsis of References to the Bahá'í Faith, in the US State Department's Reports on Human Rights 1991-2000 | publisher = Bahá'í Academics Resource Library

== Modern community ==

In 2007 the Bahá'ís cooperated in an anti-malaria project with a broad group of religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Inter-Faith Coalition Launches Anti-Malaria Campaign | work = Adventists Church Official Web Site | publisher = General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists | date = June 28, 2007 | url = http://www.adventist.org/mission_and_service/features/together-against-malaria.html | accessdate = 2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Regional conferences were called for by the [[Universal House of Justice]] 20 October 2008 to celebrate recent achievements in grassroots community-building and to plan their next steps in organizing in their home areas. Just two weeks later twin conferences were held - one in [[Bahá'í Faith in South Africa|South Africa]] and the other in [[Bahá'í Faith in Kenya|Kenya]]. One regional conference was hosted by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Kenya in Nakuru in November 2008 and attracted over 1000 Bahá'ís - four of whom came from Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bahá'í International Community | first = | author-link = Bahá'í International Community | title = Big turnout for regional Baha’i conferences | newspaper = Bahá'í International News Service | date = 2008-11-11 | url =http://www.bahaiworldnews.org/story/668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demographics ===

The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimated just over 2,800 Bahá'ís in 2005.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"/&gt;

The '''Baladi-rite Prayer''' is the oldest known prayer-rite used by [[Yemenite Jews]], transcribed in a ''tiklāl'' ("[[siddur]]", plural ''tikālil'') in Yemenite Jewish parlance.

It contains the prayers used by Israel for the entire year, as well as the format prescribed for the various blessings (benedictions) recited.&lt;ref&gt;Amram Qorah, ''Sa'arat Teyman'' (2nd edition), [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7292&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=113 p. 96] (Hebrew); Yitzhak Ratzaby, ''Sefer Shulhan Arukh Ha-mequtzar'', ''Orach Chaim'' vol. 3 (Section 105, note 15), Benei Barak 2001 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 16th century, all of Yemen's Jewry made use of this one rite.&lt;ref&gt;Aharon Gaimani, ''Three Rulings in One Responsum of Rabbi Yihya Qafih, of Blessed Memory'', published in: Tehuda (volume 30), ed. Yosef Tobi, Netanya 2014, p. 83 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; Older ''Baladi-rite'' prayer books were traditionally compiled in the [[Yemenite Hebrew#History|Babylonian supralinear punctuation]],&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Gavra, ''Studies in the Yemenite Prayerbook'', vol. 1 (the Passover Haggadah), Kiryat Ono (Israel) 1988, pp. 258–354; Shows photocopies of different Yemenite Prayer books, the earliest from the year 1345 (now preserved at the Jewish Theological Seminary of New York, MS. no. 3015), and the latest from 1656, all of which bear Babylonian supralinear punctuation.&lt;/ref&gt; although today, all have transformed and strictly make use of the [[Tiberian vocalization]]. The text, however, follows the traditional [[Yemenite Hebrew|Yemenite punctuation]] of Hebrew words.

==First printing==
The Baladi-rite prayer book or '''Tiklāl''' remained in manuscript form until 1894, when the first printed edition (''[[editio princeps]]'') was published in Jerusalem by the Yemenite Jewish community,&lt;ref&gt;Shimon Greidi, ''Sefer Yamim Yedaberu: Ketivah, Arikhah, Hadpessah—1933–1993'', Tel-Aviv/Jaffa 1995, pp. 71–72 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; which included the ''Etz Ḥayim'' commentary written by Rabbi [[Yiḥyah Salaḥ]]. Today, it is used primarily by the Baladi-rite congregations of [[Yemenite Jews]] in Israel and the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]]. Baladi is an [[Arabic]] word denoting "of local use" (i.e. Yemeni), as distinguished from the prayer-rite widely used in the north (i.e. Syria and the Land of Israel), which is called in Arabic {{lang|ar|[[:wikt:شامي|شامي]]}} ''Shāmī'' "[[Syria (region)|Levantine]], Eastern".
[[File:Babylonian_Supralinear_Punctuation,_from_Yemenite_Siddur,_April_2015.jpg|thumb|right|Section of the "[[Pirkei Avot]]" section of a Yemeni Siddur with [[Babylonian vocalization]])]]

==Comparison with the Sephardic prayer rite==
The ''Baladi-rite'' prayer differs in many aspects from the [[Sephardic law and customs|Sephardic rite]] prayer, or what was known locally as the ''Shāmī''-rite prayer book, which by the 18th and 19th centuries was already widely used in Yemen, although only lately introduced into Yemen by Jewish travelers. Their predilection for books composed in the Land of Israel made them neglect their own hand-written manuscripts, though they were of a more exquisite and ancient origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amram Qorah]], ''Sa'arath Teiman'', Jerusalem 1988, pp. 16–17 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

The nineteenth century Jewish historiographer, [[Hayyim Habshush|Hayyim Hibshush]], has given some insights into the conflict that arose in the Jewish community of [[Sana'a]] on account of the newer Sephardic prayer book being introduced there. Yiḥya, the son of one of the community's most respectable leaders, Shalom ben Aharon HaKohen al-Iraqi (known as ''al-'Usṭā'' - "the artisan"),&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih]], his edition of the Yemenite [[Haggadah]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; whose father served under two Zaydi Imams between the years 1733–1761 as the surveyor general of public buildings, had tried to make the Sephardic prayer book the standard prayer-rite of all Jews in Yemen in the 18th century. This caused a schism in the Jewish community of Sana'a, with the more zealous choosing to remain faithful to their fathers' custom (i.e. the Baladi-rite) and to continue its perpetuation, since it was seen as embodying the original customs practised by Yemenite Jews. Out of a total of twenty-two synagogues in Sana'a, only three synagogues in the city chose to remain with the original Baladi-rite prayer, while the others adopted the Spanish-rite prayer with its innovations introduced by [[Isaac Luria]].&lt;ref&gt;''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Hayyim Hibshush]] (ed. Yosef Qafih), ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, p. 718 and [https://web.archive.org/web/20141022152755/http://www.ybz.org.il/_Uploads/dbsArticles/sefunotII_OCR.pdf#page=275 Sefunot, volume 2, Jerusalem 1958], page רסז (p. 275 in PDF pagination) (Hebrew), in which the author writes, {{quote|If your soul be grieved [at the calamity that hath befallen us], please consider the events that have happened to the scholarly Rabbi, our teacher and Master, Yiḥya the son of the honorable Rabbi Yehudah al-Ṣa'adi, the President of the [[Beth din|beit din]] for the [Jewish] communities in Yemen, who fought a just battle against those who make themselves pious, forsaking their own customs and their Yemenite fathers' customs, which have been the customary practice according to the handwritten Prayer Books that are called by us ''al-tikālil'', and who grasp anew customs, found in the printed [[Machzor]]s, in matters of the prayers and other customs... And also, [other] men, [[Talmid Chacham|Talmidei Chachamim]], had joined together with the President of the court, the honorable Rabbi Yiḥya al-Ṣa'adi, [in his fight] to abolish these new customs [which they had taken] upon themselves, but to no avail, for in their time there was a certain wise man great in [[Torah]], stature ({{lang-he|ובמעלה}}), and [knowledgeable in the writings of the] [[posek|poskim]], and above all was infatuated over the books of the [[Kabbalah|kabbalists]], [namely] the honorable Rabbi Yiḥya son of the esteemed Minister Shalom HaKohen al-Iraqi. He was the one who stood in the breach to annul the customs of the ancients and to hold onto the new customs, until a great quarrel had been aroused [thereby, whereupon] he went [around] to synagogues to force them to leave the ancient Prayer Books in their possession and to accept the [printed Sephardic] [[machzor]]s. Now, because of the greatness of his position and the position of his father, the Minister, nineteen synagogues accepted it upon themselves, except for three synagogues [who] prepared themselves within the synagogues to resist him with staves and were unwilling to listen to him unto this day.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It must be noted that the above is told through the lens of Hibshush who writes of Yiḥya, the son of Shalom (''al-'Usṭā''). However, Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih]], the editor of Hibshush's ''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' cited above, tells not of the son Yiḥya, but of Shalom ben Aharon HaKohen Iraqi (Qafih's edition of the Yemenite [[Haggadah]] [אגדתא דפסחא, 5719], p. 10-11) as did the court of Sana'a in their 5671 (1911) response to Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook|Avraham Yitzchak HaCohen Kook]] (Masa' le-Teiman (Hebrew: מסע לתימן; Tel Aviv, 5712), p. 197: "ובזמן שעמד הנשיא ר' שלום עראקי שהיה משנה למלך הערבי המולך בצנעה. והיו ידיו רב לו לעשות כרצונו וביד חזקה הכריח קהילות רבות להתפלל ע"פ סידור האר"י נוסח ספרד ולעזוב סידור התפילה להרמב"ם. וגם שלא לגלח בימי העומר וכיוצא בענינים אלו. וקצת קהילות עמדו על עמדם ולא אבו לשמוע לו."). Cf. Amram Qorah, ''Sa'arat Teyman'' (2nd edition), Jerusalem 1988, p. 16–18 (Hebrew pagination), who writes (p. [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7292&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=30 17]): "In the days of the Minister, '''Shalom''' (''al-'Ousta''), a few of the wise men of that generation saw [fit] that it was best that the entire congregation would pray like the custom found in the land of Israel [namely] in the prayer-rite of the Sephardic Prayer Books, and their counsel was that those unto whom the ''Baladi-rite'' Prayer Book (''Tiklāl'') was still fluent in their mouths, that the Nasi would provide them with Sephardic Prayer Books so that all would be accustomed to praying with one prayer-rite, and the Nasi consented to this [advice]. Then were those Rabbis stirred who held fast to praying as the ''Tiklāl'' [i.e., ''Baladi-rite''], and at their head was Rabbi Yehuda ben Shelomo al-Sa'adi [d. 1740] and the Judge Rabbi Pinhas ben Shelomo Ha-Kohen al-Iraqi of blessed memory, and they wrote proclamations in the form of rabbinic decisions [saying] that it is forbidden to change the customs of [their] fathers that were established according to the words of the [[Geonim]] of old and the '[[Mishneh Torah|Composition]]' of Maimonides that came after them."&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the Jewish community's demise, owing to mass immigration in the mid-20th century, most synagogues in Sana'a had already returned to praying in the Baladi-rite,&lt;ref&gt;Aharon Gaimani, ''Three Rulings in One Responsum of Rabbi Yihya Qafih, of Blessed Memory'', published in: Tehuda (volume 30), ed. Yosef Tobi, Netanya 2014, p. 84 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; albeit, in the vast majority of towns and villages across Yemen they clung to their adopted Sephardic-rite as found in the printed books of [[Venice]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Amsterdam]] and, especially, the ''Tefillath Haḥodesh'' and ''Zekhor le-Avraham'' prayer books printed in [[Livorno]].&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi, ''The Prayer-rite of the Jews of Yemen'', printed in: ''TEMA - Journal of Judeo-Yemenite Studies'' (Issue 7), Netanya 2001, pp. 31–32 (Hebrew); Moshe Gavra, ''Meḥqarim basiddurei tayman'': ''Studies in the Prayer Books of Yemen'', vol. 1, Benei Barak 2010, p. 337 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rabbi [[Yiḥyah Qafiḥ]] (1850–1931), a Chief Rabbi of Yemen, the original Yemenite version of the [[Amidah]] is the format that was prescribed by the [[Great Assembly]] ({{Lang-he-n|אנשי כנסת הגדולה}}), who enacted the prayer in the fourth century BCE, with the one exception of the Benediction said against [[Heresy in Judaism|sectarians]], which was enacted many years later.&lt;ref&gt;Aharon Gaimani, ''Three Rulings in One Responsum of Rabbi Yihya Qafih, of Blessed Memory'', published in: Tehuda (volume 30), ed. Yosef Tobi, Netanya 2014, pp. 83–92 (Hebrew). It is worthy of mentioning that the Great Assembly comprised such men as Daniel, Nehemiah and Ezra, concerning whom the Jerusalem Talmud (''Berakhot'' 17a) says, "One-hundred and twenty or so elders and among them eighty or so prophets enacted this prayer." Cf. Babylonian Talmud, ''Berakhot'' 28b. Aside from the first three benedictions and the last three benedictions, none of the middle benedictions were at first arranged in any special order, until the first or second century CE, when they were finally given the set order that we have today ([[Rabbeinu Hananel]], ''ibid''.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yiḥyah Salaḥ]] (1713–1805) wrote an extensive commentary on the Baladi-rite Prayer Book in which he mostly upholds the old practices described therein (e.g. the practice of saying only one [[Mussaf]]-prayer during [[Rosh Hashanah]], etc.),&lt;ref&gt;The Yemenite custom of praying only one ''Mussaf''-prayer during the Jewish New Year, rather than making first a silent prayer followed by a repetition of the prayer made aloud by the ''Shaliach Tzibbur'', is described by Rabbi Yiḥyah Salaḥ in his ''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim'', facsimile edition, published by Karwani Yaakov of Rosh Ha-Ayin, Vol. II, on the morning of Rosh Hashanah, s.v. {{lang|he|תפלת מוסף}}, and which Yemenite practice is similar to a teaching brought down in the Jerusalem Talmud (''Berakhot'' 36a – 36b). Yiḥyah Salaḥ makes use of harsh expletives while writing about the preservation of the original Yemenite Jewish practice: "'Moreover, it can be stated that the benedictions [made in our prayers] on New Year's day and on the Day of Atonement are different, for [on these days] the emissary of the congregation who leads them in prayer fulfills everyone's obligation.' Wherefore, it was thought by Rabbi Yonah that even if someone had turned his heart to other things while in the midst of [saying] a benediction, the emissary of the congregation [still] fulfills his obligation. Yet in the other blessings he does not [fulfill his obligation]. So has it been stated under this man's name. For our purpose, I have copied down all of his words where a lesson was to be learned by such words of an exemplary nature as far as several ''halachic'' practices were concerned. And in the ''Tiklāl'' that our teacher wrote, even the Rabbi, Yiḥya al-Bashiri of blessed memory, it is written in the Arabian tongue, of which this is its content: 'Let it be known that, throughout the entire course of the year, men ought to pray silently. After which, the emissary of the congregation prays with a loud voice in order to fulfill the obligation of those who do not know [the prayer themselves]. However, during the ''Mussaf'' prayer on the New Year's Day the custom is not to begin by praying silently, but rather the emissary of the congregation begins praying aloud and he fulfills the obligation of, both, those who know the benedictions in their entirety and those who do not know them. The reason for this being that the benedictions are long [during these days of the year] and not everyone is familiar with them as is the emissary of the congregation. Yet during the other days of the year, the emissary of the congregation does not fulfill the obligation [of any], except only of that person who knows not [the benedictions].' You have, herewith, been shown [the matter] so that you might know just how many great multitudes of men confirm our customs, even the custom of our ancient most forebears [as it has been passed down unto us] nearly since the days of the destruction, as it is generally held and accepted by us, [which is to say], the traditions of our forefathers. So who is it that after considering these mighty kings (who all agree with common consent, and all walk with perfect persuasion of the affirmative [saying] that there must be only one [''Mussaf''] prayer), will yet incline his thoughts, as it were, to contradict their practice? Certainly he ought to be apprehensive and wary lest they [come and] crush his skull…. Hear my son the instruction of thy father, and do not thou forsake the law of thy mother.  Be attentive to this and note it.” END QUOTE&lt;/ref&gt;  although he also compromises by introducing elements in the Yemenite prayer book taken from the books of the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalists]] and the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'', which had already become popular in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;Amram Qorah, ''Sa'arath Teiman'', Jerusalem 1988, p. 21, note 19 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; He is often seen praising the old Yemenite customs and encouraging their upkeep:
{{quote|I have also with me a ''responsum'' concerning the matter of changing our prayer custom which is in the ''Tikālil'' (Baladi-rite Prayer Books) in favor of the version found in the Spanish-rite Prayer Books, from the Rabbi, [even] our teacher, Rabbi Pinḥas Ha-Kohen Iraqi, ... and he has been most vociferous in his language against those who would change [their custom], with reproofs and [harsh] decrees in a language that isn't very cajoling. May his soul be laid up in paradise.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yiḥyah Salaḥ]], ''Tiklal 'Eṣ Ḥayim Hashalem'' (ed. Shimon Tzalach), Introduction, Jerusalem 1971 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Textual development ==
While the ancient format of the [[Amidah]] may have seen little changes since its enactment by the latter prophets, the history of the Yemenite ''Baladi-rite'' prayer book—as can be said about every [[Siddur]]—is a history of recensions and later interpolations,&lt;ref&gt;Bibliophile, [[David Sassoon#Progeny|David Solomon Sassoon]] (1880–1942), who collected some sixteen Prayer books of the Yemenite rite, ranging from the early sixteenth century (1531) to the twentieth century, writes of the Yemenite Siddur: "The study of these MSS. leads to the assumption that the liturgy of the Yemenite Jews went through many changes during the ages, and that in Yemen itself the liturgy varied according to different localities. There are traces of an earlier rite, used before Western influences penetrated into the Peninsula..." (see: David Solomon Sassoon, ''Ohel Dawid'', vol. 1, Introduction, Oxford University Press: London 1932, p. xxxvi)&lt;/ref&gt; with the addition of elements taken from the Siddur of Rabbi [[Saadia Gaon]]&lt;ref&gt;One of the more popular liturgies found in the Siddur of RSG is the ''[[piyyut]]'' known as ''Terumah Hivdilanu'', which is recited on the night of Passover, during the reading of the [[Hagaddah]]. Another custom taken from the Siddur of RSG is the recital of ''Kol Nidrei'' on the night of [[Yom Kippur]], just as Rabbi [[Yihya Salah|Yihya Saleh]] states in his ''Tiklal ‘Etz Ḥayim Hashalem'' (ed. Shimon Tzalach), vol. 4, Jerusalem 1971, p. 196a (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; and of Rabbi [[Amram Gaon]], the printed Sephardic siddurs,&lt;ref&gt;Amram Qorah, ''Sa'arat Teyman'' (2nd edition), Jerusalem 1988, p. 96–97 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as elements taken from liturgies found originally in the Land of Israel. Most of these changes began to make their way into the current Baladi-rite prayer book over a two-hundred year period, from the time of Rabbi [[Yihye Bashiri|Yiḥya Bashiri]] (d. 1661) who published his ''Tiklāl Bashiri'' in 1618 (a copy of which was made and published under the name ''Tiklāl Qadmonim'')&lt;ref&gt;See: ''Sefer Ha-Tiklal'' (ed. Yosef Ḥubarah), Jerusalem 1964 (Hebrew). A microfilm of one of many Siddurs written by Rabbi Yiḥya Bashiri can be seen at the Hebrew University National Library in Jerusalem, Manuscript Dept., Catalogue # 26787 (Hebrew); also in the archives of the Ben-Zvi Institute in Jerusalem, Microfilm # 1219 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; to the time of Rabbi [[Yiḥyah Salaḥ|Yiḥya Saleh]] (d. 1805), the latter of whom incorporating in the ''Baladi-rite'' version elements taken from [[Kabbalah]], as prescribed by [[Isaac Luria]] (Ari), as well as certain liturgical poems taken from the Sephardic prayer books. In the title page of one Yemenite Siddur completed in 1663 by the notable scribe and [[kabbalist]], Rabbi Isaac b. Abraham Wannah, the copyist makes note of the fact that, aside from the regular customs of the people of Yemen, some of the entries in his [[Siddur]] have been culled "from the customs of the people of Spain who have it as their practice to add in the prayers the ''Tikūn Ha-geshem''&lt;ref&gt;The ''Tikūn Ha-geshem'' consists of several verses in rhyme, beginning with שפעת רביבים, followed by these in rapid succession: מכסה שמים, and לשוני כוננת, and ישבעון, and אל חי יפתח, and finally אלהינו ואלהי אבותינו.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Tikūn Ha-ṭal''&lt;ref&gt;The ''Tikūn Ha-ṭal'' consists of four liturgical poems in rhymed verse: שזופת שמש, and לשוני כוננת, and לך לשלום גשם and finally אלהינו ואלהי אבותינו.&lt;/ref&gt; (special emendations made for rain and for dew so that they may not be withheld), as well as the ''Tikūnei Shabbat Malkah'' as is practised by the people of the Land of Israel,"&lt;ref&gt;Norman Golb, ''Spertus College of Judaica—Yemenite Manuscripts (an illustrative catalogue)'', Spertus College Judaica Press: Chicago 1972, p. 18. Although the prayer book in the ''Spertus College of Judaica'' collection is dated 1663, the same innovations were added in the Title-page of a ''Siddur'' written by Rabbi Yitzhak Wannah in 1645. By ''Tikūnei Shabbat Malkah'' is meant the recital of six Psalms (Pss. 95–99; 29) established by Rabbi [[Moshe Cordevero]], and the ''piyyut'' "[[Lekha Dodi]]" written by Rabbi [[Shlomo Alkabetz]] in Safed, as well as the ''piyyut'' "Bar-Yochai." See: Yitzhak Wannah, ''Rekhev Elohim'' (ed. Yitzhak Ratzaby), Benei Barak 1992, pp. 43, 74 (Hebrew); Aharon Gaimani, ''Changes in the Heritage of Yemenite Jewry'', Ramat-Gan 2005, p. 52 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., the Psalms readings beginning with '''לכו נרננה''', etc.,&lt;ref&gt;Pss. 95–99; 29&lt;/ref&gt; and the liturgy '''לכה דודי''', followed by '''בר יוחאי''', and '''יגדל אלהים חי'''. Originally, the practice was to begin the Sabbath prayer on the night of the Sabbath by reciting only “''mizmor shir le'yom ha-shabbath''” (Ps. 92).&lt;ref&gt;Aharon Gaimani, ''Changes in the Heritage of Yemenite Jewry'' (''Under the Influence of Shulḥhan ʻArukh and the Kabbalah of R. Yitṣḥaq Luria''), Bar-Ilan University: Ramat-Gan 2005, p. 52 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded mentioning of ''Tikūn Ha-ṭal'' (said before the ''Mussaf''-prayer on the first day of Passover) in any extant Yemenite prayer book appeared only in 1583.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Gavra, ''Meḥqarim basiddurei tayman: Studies in the Prayer Books of Yemen'', vol. 3, Benei Barak 2010, p. 219 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; Included in the ''Tikūnei Shabbat'' book were the special readings for the nights of ''Shavu'ot'' and ''Hoshanna Rabba''.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhak Wannah, ''Rekhev Elohim'' (ed. Yitzhak Ratzaby), Benei Barak 1992, pp. 43–44, note *ג&lt;/ref&gt;

The texts of old Yemenite [[Siddur]]s copied by Rabbi [[Yihye Bashiri]] are an invaluable source for comparing the ''variae lectiones'' (Textual variations) of liturgy before the redaction of the [[Babylonian Talmud]]. For example, in all older Yemenite Siddurs copied by Bashiri is found the version '''גואל ישראל''' (''He who redeems Israel'') in the second blessing after ''[[Qiryat Shema]]'' in the evening prayer and on the night of Passover, that is, in the present-progressive tense instead of in the past tense ('''גאל ישראל'''), although the requirement made by [[Rava (amora)|Rava]] in the Talmud &lt;small&gt;(Pesaḥim 117b)&lt;/small&gt; calls for saying it in the past tense. Scholars point out that the Yemenite practice was the original custom in Yemen before Rava's interdict,&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Gavra, ''Studies in the Prayer Books of Yemen'' (Heb. מחקרים בסידורי תימן), vol. 1, Benei Barak 2010, pp. 68, 260–261; Moshe Gavra, ''Studies in the Prayerbook - The Passover Haggadah'', vol. 1, Benei Barak 1988, pp. 146–153.&lt;/ref&gt; the memorial of which also being brought down in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]].&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhak Ratzaby, ''Commentary on the Passover Haggadah - from the `Tiklāl Eṣ Ḥayim`'' (Yemenite version), second edition, Bnei Barak 1996, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Yemenite Siddur showing Sephardic Influence.jpg|thumb|Siddur written in Yemen showing Sephardic influence]]
=== Changes to the original Yemenite text ===
Among the later changes made to the text of the ''Baladi-rite'' prayer book is the wording ''Kether Yitenu'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''כתֿר יתנו'''}}), etc., said during the ''Ḳeddushah'' (i.e. the third benediction in the prayer itself) at the time of the ''[[Mussaf]]'' prayer, as is the custom of Spain (Sepharad) with only minor variations.&lt;ref&gt;''Tiklāl 'Etz Ḥayim Hashalem'' (ed. Shimon Tzalach), vol. 1, Jerusalem 1971, p. 289b (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of its wide acceptance in Yemen, among both Baladi and Shāmī congregations, Rabbi [[Yiḥyah Qafiḥ]] (d. 1932) did not accept this innovation, but rather ordained in his place of study to continue to say ''Naqdishakh'' ({{Lang-he-n|נקדישך}}) in all of the prayers,&lt;ref&gt;Shalom Gamliel, ''Al-Jāma'—Ha-ma'asef'', Jerusalem 1988, p. 137 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; just as had been their accepted tradition from the [[Great Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;See Or Hahalichot periodical, [https://web.archive.org/web/20141028075404/http://net-sah.org/files/OrHahalichot78_0.pdf#page=4 Nisan 5774] issue (p. 4) where Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih]] talks about כתר and נקדישך.&lt;/ref&gt; The Yemenite adaptation of saying ''Kether'' during the [[Mussaf]]—although not mentioned in the ''Order of Prayers'' prescribed by [[Maimonides]]—is largely due to the influence of [[Amram Gaon]]'s ''Siddur'',&lt;ref&gt;''Seder Rav Amram Gaon'', ed. Goldschmidt: Jerusalem 1971&lt;/ref&gt; which mentions the custom of the two Academies in Babylonia during the days of [[Natronai ben Hilai]] to say it during the third benediction of the 'Standing Prayer.' The practice of saying ''Kether'' during the ''Mussaf'' is also mentioned in the ''[[Zohar]]'' ("Parashat Pinḥas").&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer Ha-Zohar'' (with ''Ha-Sulam'' commentary), vol. 8 (P. ''Pinḥas''), section # 569), London 1975, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable changes occurring in the Baladi-rite prayer book during the [[geonic]] period are the additions of ''Adon ha-ʿolamim'' ({{lang|he|אדון העולמים}}), which mark the opening words in the Baladi-rite Siddur before the Morning benediction, and the praise which appears further on and known as ''Barukh shʾamar'' ({{lang|he|ברוך שאמר}}),&lt;ref&gt;Amram Qorah, ''Sa‘arat Teyman'' (2nd edition), Jerusalem 1988, p. 96 (Hebrew). Notwithstanding, the actual existence of this famous praise dates back to a much earlier time and which, according to [[Zechariah Dhahiri]] in his ''Ṣeidah la'derekh'' (published in Taj – Pentateuch, vol. 2, Hasid Publishers, Jerusalem 1991, p. 28 [14b]), "fell down from heaven inscribed on a slip of parchment", and which praise contained in it the word "Baruch" ten times, representative of the "ten enunciations" (Heb. ''ma'amarot'') with which God created the universe. See also Yiḥyah Salaḥ, ''Pisqei Maharitz'' (ed. Rabbi Yitzhak Ratzaby), vol. 1, Benei Barak 1993, p. 113 (Hebrew). Rabbi [[David Abudirham]], in his seminal work ''Sefer Abudirham'', writes in the name of Rav Amram Gaon that the word "Baruch" should be said fifteen times, signifying the fifteen words in the ''Birkath Cohenim'' (''Sefer Abudirham'', Warsaw 1877, p. 37 [19a]).&lt;/ref&gt; which appears immediately following a short praise composed by [[Judah Halevi]], ''Ha-mehulal le'olam'' (Heb. '''המהולל לעולם''')&lt;ref&gt;On Yehudah Halevi's authorship of המהולל לעולם, see: Yiḥyah Salaḥ, ''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim Hashalem'' (ed. Shimon Tzalach), vol. 1, Jerusalem 1971, p. 58b. In the words of Yiḥyah Salaḥ (ibid.), ''Etz Hayim'' commentary: המהולל וכו' שבח זה מרבי' יהודה הלוי ז"ל&lt;/ref&gt; and which is said before the recital of the selected Psalms (''[[Pesukei dezimra|zemirot]]''). These, among other innovations, have long since been an integral part of the Baladi-rite [[Siddur]].

In subsequent generations, other additions have been added thereto, such as the ''Yotzer'' verses that are said on the Sabbath day (i.e. those verses which mention the creation, hence: ''yotzer'' = "who createth");&lt;ref&gt;The Yemenite custom is now to say the benediction known as ''Yotzer Shabbath''. Yiḥyah Salaḥ adopted the view that it ought to be said while relying upon Yemenite Rabbi Shelomo Taizi, who states: "The reason it was omitted in our prayer books, and even in the books of [[Maimonides]], of blessed memory, is because it was forgotten on account of the many hardships and wanderings [suffered by the people]." The ''Yotzer Shabbath'' comprises that liturgy known as the "greater Alpha-Beta", ''viz''., ''&lt;big&gt;E&lt;/big&gt;l Adon 'al kol hama'asim'' (The Lord is Master over all His works); ''&lt;big&gt;B&lt;/big&gt;orukh u'mevorakh befi kol haneshamah'' (Blessed is He and acclaimed by every living thing), etc.," and is a teaching from the [[Zohar]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the last blessing made in the recital of ''[[Shema Yisrael|Ḳiryat Shĕma]]'' (i.e. the second blessing thereafter) on the Sabbath evening, since in the original prayer text there was no difference between Sabbaths and weekdays; Likewise, the modern practice is to chant the prosaic Song of the Sea (שירת הים) before one recites ''Yishtabaḥ'', although in the original ''Baladi-rite'' prayer the song came after ''Yishtabaḥ'', seeing that it is not one of the songs of David.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Gavra, ''Studies in the Prayer Books of Yemen'' (Heb. מחקרים בסידורי תימן), vol. 1, Benei Barak 2010, pp. 206 – 208.&lt;/ref&gt; In today's Baladi-ride Siddur, an interpolation of eighteen verses known as ''Rafa'eini Adonai we'erafei'' (Heb. '''רפאיני יי' וארפא''') has been inserted between the prosaic Song of the Sea and ''Yishtabaḥ'', just as it appears in the ''Tiklāl Mashta'', compiled by Rabbi [[Shalom Shabazi]] in 1655,&lt;ref&gt;''Tiklāl Mashta—Shabazi'' (facsimile edition), ed. Binyamin Oded, Jerusalem 1986, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; although the same verses do not appear in the ''Tiklāl Bashiri'' compiled in 1618. Another custom which has found its way into the Yemenite prayer book is the practice of rescinding all vows and oaths on the eve of [[Rosh Hashanah]] ([[Kol Nidre]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Yiḥyah Salaḥ]], ''Tiklāl 'Etz Ḥayim Hashalem'' (ed. Shimon Tzalach), vol. 4, Jerusalem 1971 (Hebrew), p. 73b&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, in the older handwritten Baladi-rite prayer books, in the first blessing following the ''[[Shema Yisrael|Ḳiryat Shĕma]]'', or what is called in {{Lang-he-n| '''אמת ויציב'''}} = ''emeth wayaṣiv'', the original Yemenite custom was to say only eight [[Waw (letter)|waw]]s in the opening lines of the blessing, just as the blessing appears in Maimonides' ''Seder Ha-Tefillah'' (Order of Prayer),&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer Ha-Tiklāl'' (''Tiklāl Qadmonim''), ed. Yosef Ḥubārah, Jerusalem 1964, p. 6b – also in note "aleph" (ibid.). For example: אמת ויציב, נכון וקיים, ישר ונאמן, אהוב וחביב, נחמד ונעים, נורא ואדיר, מתוקן ומקובל, טוב ויפה הדבר הזה עלינו לעולם ועד.&lt;/ref&gt; and not as it is now commonly practised to insert seven additional [[Waw (letter)|waw]]s in the blessing for a total of fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;Example: אמת ויציב, ונכון וקיים, וישר ונאמן, ואהוב וחביב, ונחמד ונעים, ונורא ואדיר, ומתוקן ומקובל, וטוב ויפה הדבר הזה עלינו לעולם ועד.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes, like the others, are directly related to the dissemination of Sephardic Siddurs in Yemen, and influenced, especially, by the writings of Rabbi [[David Abudirham]].&lt;ref&gt;Yiḥyah Salaḥ makes mention of ''Sefer Abudirham'' in his commentary ''Etz Ḥayim'', when mentioning ''emeth wayaṣiv'' and how that Rabbi David Abudirham, in his treatise on the Tefillah (''Sefer Abudirham'', Warsaw 1877, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=26840&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=47 p. 50]; in PDF p. 47), requires saying fifteen [[Waw (letter)|waw]]s, symbolizing the fifteen ascensions in the Book of Psalms, commencing with ''Shir hama'aloth '' (Pss. 120–134). See: ''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim Hashalem'' (ed. Shimon Tzalach), vol. 1, Jerusalem 1971, p. 95b.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] ====
No doubt the greatest changes to the Baladi-rite prayer book have come in wake of kabbalistic practices espoused by [[Isaac Luria]], which have since been incorporated in the Yemenite Siddur. The proclamation "''Adonai melekh, Adonai malakh, Adonai yimlokh le'olam wa'ed''" said by some each day before ''Barukh shĕ'amar'' is from the teachings of Isaac Luria.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yiḥyah Salaḥ]], ''Tiklāl 'Etz Ḥayim Hashalem'' (ed. Shimon Tzalach), vol. 1, Jerusalem 1971 (Hebrew), p. 57b&lt;/ref&gt; The saying of ''Aleinu le'shebeaḥ'' (Heb. {{lang|he|עלינו לשבח}} "It is for us to praise the Lord of all things", etc.) at the conclusion of the prayer, although originally said only during the Mussaf-prayer on [[Rosh Hashanah]], is also an enactment made by Isaac Luria,&lt;ref name="Yiḥya Saleh 1894"&gt;Yiḥyah Salaḥ, ''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim'', vol. 1, Jerusalem 1894, p. 88a&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Moshe ben Machir&lt;ref&gt;Author of book, ''Seder Ha-Yom''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Meir ben Ezekiel ibn Gabbai]].&lt;ref name="Yiḥya Saleh 1894"/&gt;

==== Shulchan Aruch ====&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Yiḥyah Salaḥ]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;
The ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' has also left an indelible mark upon the Baladi-rite prayer in certain areas. [[Yiḥyah Salaḥ]] (1713–1805) mentions that the old-timers in Yemen were not accustomed to reciting ''Mizmor le'Todah'' (i.e. Psalm 100) in the ''[[Pesukei dezimra]]'' of the Morning Prayer (''[[Shacharit|Shahrith]]''),&lt;ref&gt;''Tiklāl 'Etz Ḥayim'', vol. 1, Jerusalem 1894, p. 16a (Hebrew); ''Tiklāl 'Etz Ḥayim Hashalem'' (ed. Shimon Tzalach), vol. 1, Jerusalem 1971, p. 61a (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; although it too soon became the norm in the Baladi-rite congregations, based on a teaching in the ''Shulchan Aruch'' (''Orach Chaim'' § 51:9) and Rabbi [[Joseph Karo]]'s specification that it be cited in the Morning Prayer. Yiḥyah Salaḥ agreed to insert it in his Baladi-rite prayer book, saying that it was deemed just and right to recite it, seeing that “there is in it a plethora of praise unto Him, the Blessed One.”

Yiḥyah Salaḥ also initiated the custom of saying ''Ṣidqathekha'', etc.,&lt;ref&gt;The reference here is to the three verses taken from three different places in the book of Psalms, all making mention of the word ''Ṣedeq'', or "justice," in recognition of God's justice who caused three pious men of Israel to pass away from the world during the Afternoon oblation – ''viz''., Moses our Master, Joseph and King David. A debate, however, quickly arose whether or not it was permitted to make ''ṣidūq ha-din'' (i.e. the act of justifying God's judgment) on certain days, since normally it is not permitted to engage in mourning on a Sabbath day or Festival day (See: [[Yiḥyah Salaḥ|Maharitz]], Questions &amp; Responsa ''Pe'ulath Ṣadiq'', vol. III, ''responsum'' # 150).&lt;/ref&gt; in his own synagogue immediately following the [[Amidah]] of the Afternoon Prayer ([[Mincha]]) on Sabbath days, in accordance with an injunction in the ''Shulchan Aruch'' (''Orach Chaim'' § 292:2), and which practice soon spread amongst other Baladi-rite congregations.

The ''Shulchan Aruch'', with Yiḥyah Salaḥ's endorsement of certain ''Halachic'' rulings, was also the cause for other Baladi-rite customs being cancelled altogether, such as the old Yemenite Jewish custom of saying a final blessing after eating the "''karpas''" (in Yemenite tradition, "parsley") on the night of Passover; and of saying a final blessing over the second cup of wine drunk on the night of Passover; and of making a distinction between the number of [[matzo]]t that are to be taken up during the blessing when Passover falls on a Sabbath day, as opposed to when it falls on a regular day of the week; and the custom to drink a fifth cup of wine during the [[Passover Seder]].&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Gavra, ''Studies in the Yemenite Prayerbook'', vol. 1 (The Passover Haggadah), Kiryat Ono 1988, pp. 129–142&lt;/ref&gt; Yiḥyah Salaḥ also changed the original Baladi-rite practice of gesticulating the [[lulav]] (the palm frond and its subsidiaries, ''viz''. the myrtle and willow branches in one's right hand, and the citron fruit in one's left), enacting that instead of the traditional manner of moving them forward, bringing them back, raising them up, and lowering them down, while in each movement he rattles the tip of the lulav three times,&lt;ref&gt;Thus is the practice described in the Talmud and in the writings of the ''geonim'', in Maimonides' Code of Jewish law, and in Rabbi Yihya Bashiri's Baladi-rite Siddur&lt;/ref&gt; they would henceforth add another two cardinal directions, namely, to one's right and to one's left, as described in the ''Shulchan Arukh'' (''Orach Chaim'' § 651:9).&lt;ref&gt;In Yemen, the synagogues faced north in the direction of Jerusalem and the congregants also stood facing north. When gesticulating the ''lolav'', they stretched it forward toward the north, facing Jerusalem. Today, in the land of Israel, if one were standing in prayer in Tel-Aviv, he would face Jerusalem which lies toward the east.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all changes in the [[siddur]], however, were the result of Yiḥyah Salaḥ's own decision to force change in his community, but rather Yiḥyah Salaḥ chose to incorporate some of the Spanish rites and liturgies in the Baladi-rite prayer book since these same practices had already become popular in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;Shimon Greidi, ''Sefer Yamim Yedaberu'', Tel-Aviv 1995, p. 97 (71), (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Amram Qorah wrote of Yiḥyah Salaḥ, saying: "He toiled much to render the precise text used in prayer according to the text of ancient Baladi-rite  prayer books (''Tikālil''), and he purged them from the versions that the later copyists of the Baladi-rite prayer books had amended thereto. Indeed, those additions which were added in the Baladi-rite prayer books based on the Spanish-rite and which they had [already] begun to observe as their own practice, he did not remove them; instead, he explained them and they were incorporated in the Baladi-rite prayer book" (Amram Qorah, ''Sa'arath Teiman'', Jerusalem 1988, p. 21-22, note 19 [Hebrew]).&lt;/ref&gt; One such practice was to begin the night of each ''Yom Tov'' (festival day) with the ''mizmor'' related to that particular holiday,&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Psalm 107]] for ''Passover''; [[Psalm 68]] for ''Shavuʻoth'' and [[Psalm 42|Psalms 42]] and [[Psalm 43|43]] for ''Sukkoth''.&lt;/ref&gt; although, originally, it was not a custom to do so, but only to begin the first night of each of the three Festival days by saying three ''mizmorim'' taken from Psalms [[Psalm 1|1]], [[Psalm 2|2]] and [[Psalm 150|150]].&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Hubara (ed.), ''Sefer Ha-Tiklāl'' (''Tiklāl Qadmonim'') of Rabbi [[Yihye Bashiri]], Jerusalem 1964, p. 29a.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice found its way into the Yemenite rite from the Spanish prayer books, whereas now the Yemenite custom incorporates both traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Razhaby |first=Yehudah |title=Reflections on the development of the "Yemen-Mahzor" |journal=Alei Sefer: Studies in Bibliography and in the History of the Printed and the Digital Hebrew Book |volume= |issue= |pages=104–105 |jstor=24164323 |date=1981 |registration=yes  }}(Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maimonides' influence ==
To what extent [[Maimonides]]’ writings actually influenced the development of the Yemenite prayer ritual is disputed by scholars. Some suggest that since the Baladi-rite prayer is almost identical to the prayer format brought down by Maimonides (1138-1204) in his ''[[Mishneh Torah]]''&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', ''Seder Ha-Tefillah'' (end of division called ''Ahavah'')&lt;/ref&gt; that it is merely a copy of Maimonides’ arrangement in prayer. This view, however, is rejected by Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih]] (1917–2000) and by Rabbi [[Avraham Al-Naddaf]] (1866–1940). According to Rabbi Yosef Qafih, the elders of Yemen preserved a tradition that the textual variant used by Maimonides in his [[Mishneh Torah]] was copied down from the texts presented to him by the Jews of Yemen, knowing that they had preserved the ancient format of the prayers, with as few innovations as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafih, "Yemenite Jewry's Connections with Major Jewish Centers", in: ''Ascending the Palm Tree – An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage'', Rachel Yedid &amp; Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, p. 39 {{OCLC|1041776317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ha-Rambam we-golath teiman'', Journal ''Sinai'', pub. Mossad Harav Kook, Jerusalem: Tammuz 1958, p. 261 (Hebrew); Maimonides' ''Mishneh Torah'' (ed. Yosef Qafih), vol. 2, Preface to ''Nusach Ha-Tefillah'' (Prayer rite), p. 711 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafih, ''Collected Papers'' ("Ketavim"), volume 2, pp. 828–830 (Hebrew): [Translation]: "As for the format of the prayer-rite that is used by them, a tradition bequeathed to us by our forefathers from early generations avers that the prayer format fixed by Maimonides in his book, Mishne Torah, he received from the Jews of Yemen, when he realized that it was unadulterated by the emendations of the Geonim and their improvements, and that it contained not the enhancements of the sages of Spain, nor the so-called "corrections" made by the cantors of Ashkenaz; as Rabbi Yiḥya Saleh (Maharitz) has written, saying that we have a tradition that all our customs regarding the prayers are very ancient, effectively dating back to the time of the [First] Temple's destruction. Even though we cannot cite proof to this effect, it can still be deduced elsewhere, by virtue of the fact that Maimonides, when he mentions incidentally the format of the prayer, writes what is different from the prayer format that he fixed in his magnum opus, at the end of Sefer Ahavah. A few examples are brought down in what follows: (1) In his commentary on the Mishnah, Tractate Berakhot, chapter 5, he wrote that in the benediction said for the annual seasons, during the winter months, one is to say, "Bless [this year] unto us" ('''ברך עלינו'''), but in the prayer format in his larger work he did not differentiate between the summer months and the winter months, writing instead that one is always to say, "Bless us" ('''ברכנו''');   (2) In Maimonides' commentary on the Mishnah, Tractate Berakhot 6:5, he writes for the version of the final blessing, known as ''Boré Nefashot'' ("The Creator of many souls"), that one is to conclude by saying, "…upon all that was created of Him who sustains the universe"  ('''על כל מה שברא חַיי העולמים'''= ''ḥai ha-ʿolamim''), but in his larger composition and in his ''Guide for the Perplexed'' (Part 1, chapter 69), he makes use of the version, "the life of the universe" ('''חֵי העולמים'''= ''ḥei ha-ʿolamim''), and thus is it written in all the prayer books of Yemen; (3) In the benediction known as Me'ayn shalosh (brief form of grace after eating cakes, etc.), there he makes use of a different version, concluding with the words, "…and for Zion, your honorable dwelling place, and for the pure land; and build Jerusalem your city, even quickly in our days, and let us eat of her fruits." However, in his larger composition, ''Hil. Berakhot'' 3:13, he did not write this version, but rather brought down the version that is found in the prayer books of Yemen; (4) Similarly, he reverts himself in the matter of the Hallel, and how the congregation is to answer the one who recites the Hallel;  (5) In Maimonides' Responsa,  he writes that the concluding lines for the eleventh benediction in the Amidah is, "O Lord, who loves righteousness and judgment," while during the Ten Days of Repentance one is to say, "O Lord, Thou King, who loves righteousness and judgment." However, in his larger composition, under the format of the prayer, he writes that for the entire year one says, "O Lord, Thou King, who loves righteousness and judgment," but during the Ten Days of Repentance he is to conclude the blessing with, "The King of the judgment"; (6) Moreover, in his Responsa,  in the benediction said after a circumcision, the version used by him is, "…has commanded, just as you have commanded those who are holy," etc. However, in his larger composition, the version of all the old texts is as the version used in Yemen, "…has commanded, by a testament of holy men," etc.; (7) Also in the composition itself, in ''Hil. Tefillah'' 2:14, he wrote that on the Ninth of Av fast day (''Tish'a be-Av'') they add the version known as ''Raḥem'' in the place of the prayer that begins, "Dwell in the midst of Jerusalem" ('''תשכון'''), for this used to be his custom, based on the Siddur of Rabbi [[Saadia Gaon]]. However, in the prayer format brought down in his larger composition, he wrote the version as it appears in Yemen, saying that Raḥem is said instead of the benediction, "Dwell in the midst of Jerusalem," that is, rather than being incorporated within it; (8) In his "Mishne Torah" (''Hil. Matanot ʿAniyim'' 10:3[6]), he wrote: "…as it says, 'You shall hear the cry of the poor'," (a verse that does not exist in the Hebrew Bible) and which statement is no more than an instance of his habitual usage of these words, taken from the text of ''Nishmat kol ḥai'' ("The Breath of All Living Things"), as found in the Spanish prayer books. However, in the format of the prayer brought down in the same composition, such words do not appear, but only the version that is used in Yemen. Neither are these words found in the prayer format that was published by D. Goldschmidt.  (9) Moreover, in his prayer format, he wrote: "The people have it as their practice in each of the ''Mussaf''-prayers, whenever they say, 'Just as you have written concerning us in your Torah, through Moses your servant,' to mention the sacrifices of the day, just as they are written in the Torah, and they read aloud the same verses. If, however, they did not mention [them], since they said, 'Just as you have written concerning us in your Torah,' etc., they are no longer required [to say them]." It follows that, as a first resort, they are required to say these verses, as the practice adhered to by Rabbeinu Tam (see: Tosefot in ''Rosh Hashanah'' 35a, s.v. '''אילימא'''), and only as a last resort, if they had not mentioned them, they are no longer required to do so. However, in the same prayer format itself, in all handwritten manuscripts of the book "Mishne Torah" (also known as, ''Yad ha-Ḥazaḳah''), as also in the Oxford MS on which text Dr. Daniel Goldschmidt published Maimonides' prayer format, the verses of the ''Mussafin'' (i.e. additional offerings made on Sabbaths and Festival days) are missing altogether. Does this not clearly prove that even after he wrote down the prayer format, just as he had been accustomed to saying, "the people have it as their practice," that he retracted the statement, correcting it to read as the version he received from Yemen, and deleting those verses? So it would seem, and nothing more."&lt;/ref&gt;  Elsewhere, in the Preface to the Yemenite Baladi-rite prayer book, ''Siyaḥ Yerushalayim'', Rabbi Qafih writes that Maimonides searched for the most accurate prayer rite and found the Yemenite version to be the most accurate.&lt;ref&gt;''Siyaḥ Yerushalayim'' (ed. Yosef Qafih), 7th edition, vol. 1, Kiryat Ono 2010, Preface.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rabbi Avraham al-Naddaf, when the prayers established by Ezra and his court (the Men of the Great Assembly) reached Yemen, the Jews of Yemen accepted them and forsook those prayers that they had formerly been accustomed to from the time of the Temple. In subsequent generations, both, in the Land of Israel and in Babylonia, the rabbinic scholars of Israel made additional innovations by adding certain texts and liturgies to the prayer format established by Ezra, which too were accepted by the Jews of Yemen (such as ''Nishmath kol ḥai'', and the prosaic ''Song of the Sea'', established by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai). Later, penitential verse written by Rabbi Saadia Gaon, by Rabbi Yehudah Halevi and by Rabbi Avraham ibn Ezra came to be incorporated in their prayer books. Eventually, when Maimonides came along and arranged the prayers in his ''Code of Jewish law'', the Jews of Yemen saw that his words were in agreement with what they had in their own prayer books, wherefore, they received him as a rabbi over them, although Maimonides had only written the format that he received from the Men of the Great Assembly, and that it happens to be the original version practised formerly by the Jews of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Avraham al-Naddaf, ''Questions &amp; Responsa ‘Zichronei Ish’'' (printed in book, '' ‘Anaf Ḥayyim''), ed. Saadia al-Naddaf, ''responsum'' # 33, Jerusalem 1981, pp. 164–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Avraham al-Naddaf’s view is corroborated by an ancient Jewish source contemporaneous with Maimonides’ ''Mishneh Torah'' before his momentous work reached Yemen, in which Jewish scholars in Yemen had debated on how to arrange the second blessing after the Shema during the Evening Prayer. The source was copied down by [[Yiḥyah Salaḥ]]&lt;ref&gt;''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim'', vol. 1, Jerusalem 1971, s.v. Evening Prayer on weekdays, p. 192a.&lt;/ref&gt; from the glosses of the Baladi-rite Prayer Book (''Tiklāl'') written by Rabbi [[Yihye Bashiri]] (d. 1661), and who, in turn, copied it from the work of a Yemenite Jewish scholar, entitled ''Epistle: Garden of Flowers'' ({{lang|he|רסאלה' בסתאן אלאזהאר}}), in which he wrote the following:
{{quote|Now what you have mentioned to us about the great ''geon'', [even] our teacher and our Rabbi, Moses [Maimonides] (may his God keep him), how that by his magnanimity [he enjoins us] to say, ''Borukh shomer 'amo yisroel'' (Blessed be He who guards His people Israel ברוך שומר עמו ישראל), it is most correct what has been transmitted unto him. Who is it that knows to do such a thing, save that man whom the spirit of the holy God is within him? For the Rabbis have spoken of only two blessings coming after it (i.e. after ''Ḳiryath Shema''),&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah ''Berakhoth'' 1:4&lt;/ref&gt; but not three! Now, as for us, concerning our composition of the order of prayers, and its arrangement and its custom which was written in the language of our Sages and used by some of the students, we have asked this question&lt;ref&gt;i.e., about whether or not the words, "Borukh shomer 'amo yisroel lo'ad", should be concluded with a blessing that employs God's name.&lt;/ref&gt; during our debates on the aforesaid composition, and we were indecisive about it due to its ambiguity, but we arranged the verses after ''Hashkiveinu''  ({{Lang-he-n|'''הַשְׁכִּיבֵנוּ'''}}) in such a way that they do not conclude after them with a blessing employing God's name, and forthwith will we stand up in prayer. After your letter reached us, teaching us about its proper application, we returned to its proper application! We succeeded in our composition to write the verses in such a way as to be identical with that which was written by him! Even so, his words seem to be even more exact than our own, proof of which is shown by what is written in Tractate ''Berakhoth'':&lt;ref&gt;''Berakhoth'' 4b&lt;/ref&gt; Mar says he reads [the verses of] ''Ḳiryath Shema'' and prays. This supports what was said by Rabbi Yohanan, ‘Who is he that is a son of the world to come? He who juxtaposes the word, ''Geulah'', in the Evening Prayer with the actual [[Amidah]] itself!’ Moreover, they have said: Although one must say ''Hashkiveinu'' (Cause us to lie down in peace, etc.) between ''Geulah'' and the standing prayer itself,&lt;ref&gt;The sense is to the beginning of that blessing which says: ''Emeth emunah kol zoth qiyam 'aleinu'', etc., and concludes with, ''Borukh attoh adonai ğo'al yisroel''.  After which they say ''Hashkiveinu'', etc.&lt;/ref&gt; this does not constitute a break in continuity.&lt;ref&gt;Since we are normally required to go from the benediction known as ''Geulah'' directly into the standing prayer (as in the Morning Prayer), the practice differs in the Evening Prayer with the addition of "Hashikiveinu."&lt;/ref&gt;  For since the Rabbis enacted the saying of ''Hashkiveinu'' (Cause us to lie down in peace, etc.) in that part of the benediction which comes directly after ''Geulah'', it is as if the benediction of ''Geulah'' was protracted! Now had it been like our words, he should have rather said: Although the Rabbis enacted ''Hashkiveinu'' and certain verses which come after it, [etc]. But since he did not say this, except only ''Haskiveinu'', learn from it that at the end he concludes [with a blessing employing God's name]! Now this blessing is as one continuous thing, and not two things.}}
Based on this testimony it is evident that the Talmud, along with Maimonides’ order of the prayer as transcribed in his [[Mishneh Torah]], have been used together to establish the final textual form of the Baladi-rite prayer commonly used in Yemen. Prior to Maimonides, the general trend in Yemen was also to follow the ''halakhic'' rulings of the [[geonim]], including their format used in the blessings. Rabbi Saʻīd ibn Daoud al-ʻAdeni, in a commentary which he wrote on Maimonides' ''Mishneh Torah'' (ca. 1420 – 1482), writes of the final blessing said over wine: "What is found in the writings of most of the ''geonim'' is to conclude the blessing after drinking the fruit of the vine by saying, ['Blessed art Thou, O Lord], ''for the vine and the fruit of the vine'',' and thus is it found written in the majority of the prayer books in the cities throughout Yemen."&lt;ref&gt;''Commentary of Rabbeinu Saʻīd ben David al-ʻAdeni'' (ed. Pinhas Qorah), Kiryat Sefer 2010, (s.v. ''Berakhot'' 8:14), p. 87 (Hebrew). Cf. ''Sefer Halakhoth Pesuqoth le'Rav Yehudai Gaon z"l'', Jerusalem 1999, p. 476, which final form of the blessing is exactly like the old Yemenite tradition.&lt;/ref&gt; However, today, in all the Baladi-rite prayer books, the custom after drinking wine is to conclude the blessing with the format that is brought down in Maimonides, "Blessed art Thou, O Lord, ''for the land and for its fruits''",&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'' (''Hil. Berakhot'' 8:14); ''Tiklal Torath Avoth'' (ed. Nathanel Alsheikh), vol. 1, Benei Barak 1996, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; showing that Maimonides' impact over the development of the Yemenite Siddur has been vital.

== Distinguishing features ==
The Baladi-rite prayer in its current textual form, at least in its uniqueness as a text that stands in a distinct category of its own and that does not fully conform with any other version, belongs without question to the Babylonian or eastern branch of the prayer ritual variants, a branch whose first clear formulation came through Rabbi [[Saadia Gaon]] and his [[Siddur]]. By simple comparison with other prayer-rites of other Jewish communities, the Yemenite version shows distinct signs of antiquity, in which, generally speaking, it is possible to say that it is the version least adulterated of all prayer versions practised in Israel today, including the original Ashkenazi version.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi, ''TEMA - Journal of Judeo-Yemenite Studies'', vol. 7. Association for Society and Culture, Netanya 2001. Article: ''Nosaḥ ha-tefillah shel yehudei teyman'', p. 41 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of a general trend to accommodate other well-known Jewish traditions (e.g. Sephardic, etc.), the Baladi-rite prayer book has still retained much of its traditional distinguishing features. Among them:

*In the Baladi-rite tradition, there is no "confession of sins" ({{Lang-he-n|'''וידוי'''}}) arranged in alphabetical order, nor is there any confession said immediately prior to saying ''taḥanūnim'' (supplications) during ''nefilat panim'' following the [[Amidah|Standing Prayer]]. Rather, the custom is to lie upon the floor on one's left side, cover one's head in his ''talith'' and to say the supplication, ''Lefanekha ani korea'', etc., followed by ''Avinu malkeinu, avinu attah'', etc., excepting Mondays and Thursdays on which days the petitioner will also add other suppliant verses such as, ''ana a-donai eloheinu'', etc., and ''wehu raḥum yikhaper 'awon'', etc., as are found in the Sephardic prayer books.&lt;ref&gt;Moreover, on Mondays they say: ה' איה חסדיך הראשונים, etc., while on Thursdays they say: ה' שארית פליטת אריאל, etc. Even so, the practice of saying these verses was only lately introduced in Yemen around the 18th century, seeing that in all the old Baladi-rite prayer books there is no recollection of the said suppliant verses on Mondays and Thursdays, nor of ''Avinu malkeinu'' on the other days of the week (See: Moshe Gavra, ''Meḥqarim basiddurei tayman'': ''Studies in the Prayer Books of Yemen'', vol. 1, Benei Barak 2010, pp. 336–343).&lt;/ref&gt;
*The custom of the Jews of [[Ashkenaz]] is to read the verses of ''Ḳiryat Shema'' ("Shema Yisrael") each man to himself and silently. In contrast, with the [[Sephardic Jews]], the ''ḥazan'' reads aloud the verses of ''Ḳiryat Shema'', without the participation of his congregation. With the Yemenites, on the other hand, the entire congregation reads it aloud and in perfect unison.&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Ratzaby, "Ancient Customs of the Yemenite-Jewish Community", in: ''Ascending the Palm Tree – An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage'', Rachel Yedid &amp; Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, p. 60 {{OCLC|1041776317}}. In the [[Midrash Rabba]] (Canticles Rabba) on the verse (Song of Songs 8:13), "She who sits in the gardens, [your] friends listen to your voice; let me hear it,"  which has been expounded there to mean: "When Israel enters the synagogues and they recite ''Ḳiryat Shema'', with sincerity of purpose and perfect unison, with concentration and agreeable sound, the Holy One, blessed be He, says to them: She who sits in the gardens, when you read [as] friends, my retinue and I listen to your voice; let me hear it. But when Israel recites ''Ḳiryat Shema'' with discord, the one preceding ahead and the other lagging behind, and they do not recite ''Ḳiryat Shema'' with sincerity of purpose, the Holy Spirit calls out and says, "Go off, my beloved!"&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The version of the [[Kaddish]] used in the Baladi-rite is also unique, containing elements not found in the Siddur used by other communities, and is believed to date back in antiquity. (Open window for text)

*In the earlier Baladi-rite prayer books one could not find at the conclusion of the morning, afternoon, and evening prayers the text now widely known as ''[[Alénu le-Shabbe'ah|ʻAleinu le-shabeaḥ]]'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''עלינו לשבח'''}}),&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafih, ''Siaḥ Yerushalayim'' (7th edition), Kiryat-Ono 2010, p. 89 (note 1)&lt;/ref&gt; but only in the [[Mussaf]]-prayer said on [[Rosh Hashanah]]. Unique to Jewish prayer rituals, today, the custom among adherents to the Baladi-rite is to say ''Aleinu le’shebeaḥ'' only during the Morning (''shaḥrith'') and Evening (''{{'}}arvith'') prayers, but not in the Afternoon prayer (''minḥah'').&lt;ref&gt;According to Rabbi Shalom Yitzhak Halevi, quoting from ''Tiklāl Khalaf'', the reason ''Aleinu le'shebeaḥ'' is not said during the Afternoon prayer (''minḥah'') is because they never enacted the saying of ''Aleinu le’shebeaḥ'' except to counter the worshippers of the sun in the morning, and the worshippers of the moon in the evening (See: Shalom Yitzḥak Halevi, ''Divrei Shalom Ḥakhamim'', Jerusalem 1993, p. 289, citing the words of Rabbi Shalom Yitzḥak Halevi which were inscribed in the margin of his 1894 edition of ''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim'', p. 88a). This opinion is also brought down by Rabbi Yitzhak Wanna in his Baladi-rite prayer book. Even so, according to Maharitz, in his commentary ''Etz Ḥayim'', the omission of ''Aleinu le'shebeaḥ'' during the Afternoon prayer was a teaching espoused by the Rabbi and ''kabbalist'', [[Meïr ibn Gabbai]], author of ''Tola'at Ya'akov'' (written in 1507), who wrote: "We do not say ''Aleinu le'shebeaḥ'' except in the morning and in the evening, but not during the Afternoon prayer." (Yiḥya Saleh, ''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim'', vol. 1, Jerusalem 1894, p. 88a; ''ibid.'' vol. 1, Jerusalem 1971, p. 168a)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Dr. Aharon Gaimani of Bar-Ilan University, [[Zechariah Dhahiri|Yihya (Zechariah) al-Dhahiri]] (d. 1608) was the first of Yemenite Sages to introduce the practice of saying ''Aleinu le’shabeaḥ'' at the conclusion of the prayer, which practice was adopted also among Baladi-rite congregations. Dr. Gaimani cites al-Dhahiri, who brings down elements of the Sephardic prayer rite in his theosophical commentary on the Pentateuch, ''Ṣeidah la’derekh'' (Victuals for the Road), published in ''Taj'' – Pentateuch, 2 volumes, Hasid Publishers, Jerusalem 1991 (Hebrew); q.v. vol. 2, on Leviticus, chapter 7 – Parashat ''Ṣav'', p. 32 (16b): "He then concludes after everything [by saying] ''Aleinu le’shabeaḥ''. The reason being that in the world there are idolaters, who according to their custom bow down to their idols each day, while we [on the other hand] are required to praise and to bow down in our manner of service, seeing that we are not like unto them, may God forbid, since they bow down to vanity and emptiness and pray to that which is no profit, etc." (See: Gaimani’s lecture notes, entitled: מנהגים עתיקים ומנהגים חדשים בתורתו של ר' זכריה אלצ'אהרי, given at the Ben-Zvi Institute on 18 June 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
*The older prayer books also contained formularies of documents (Marriage contracts, bills of divorce, court waiver of rights to payment,&lt;ref&gt;Hebrew: שובר. See: ''Sefer Ha-Tiklāl'' (''Tiklal Qadmonim''), ed. Yosef Ḥubārah, Jerusalem 1964, p. 221b, s.v. נוסח שובר&lt;/ref&gt; legal attestations,&lt;ref&gt;Hebrew: קיום השטר. See: ''Sefer Ha-Tiklāl'' (''Tiklal Qadmonim''), ed. Yosef Ḥubārah, Jerusalem 1964, p. 222a, s.v. קיום השטר&lt;/ref&gt; calendric tables for reckoning the [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] of the years, etc.) which are lacking in the modern prayer books. Most also contained [[Halakhic]] compendia, such as the ''modi operandi'' for [[Havdallah]] ceremonies at the conclusion of Sabbath days and festival days, and for establishing symbolic joint ownership of a shared courtyard ([[Eruv#Eruv chatzerot|'' 'erub'']]), and for separating the dough portion ([[Hallah (Talmud)|''ḥallah'']]), as well as for the redemption of one's firstborn son (''[[pidyon haben]]'') and for the ceremony of [[Brit milah|circumcision]]. So, too, the Old Baladi-rite prayer books contained a brief overview of the laws governing the making of tassels (''[[tzitzit]]'') worn on garments, and the writing of door-post scripts (''[[mezuzah]]''), ''inter alia''. Most also contained a copious collection of [[Piyyut|liturgical poems]] and penitential verse (''[[selichot]]'').
*The single individual who prays alone and who is unable to join a quorum of at least ten adult men (''[[minyan]]'') follows nearly the same standard format as those who pray among the congregants. However, unlike the congregation, he that prays alone alters the ''[[Kaddish]]'' by saying in its place what is known as ''Bĕrīkh shĕmeh deḳuddsha bĕrikh hū le'eilā le'eilā'', etc., both, before and after the [[Amidah|Standing Prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;This tradition is mentioned by Rabbi Yiḥya Bashiri, in his ''Tiklāl Qadmonim'', a Hebrew translation of which is brought down in Rabbi Yiḥya Ṣāleḥ’s ''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim Hashalem'' (ed. Shimon Saleh), vol. 3, Jerusalem 1971, s.v. ''Leshon tiklāl haqadmon'', pp. 238b–239a; in other editions, vol. 3, p. 310. It is also mentioned by Rabbi Yiḥya Ṣāleḥ (Maharitz) in ''Pisqei Maharitz'' (ed. Yizhak Ratzaby), vol. 1, Benei Barak 1993, p. 153 (''Hil. Birkot ha-shaḥar'', Halachah 79); p. 206 (''Hil. Tefillah'', Halachah 11).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Tiklāl Mashta—Shabazi'' (facsimile edition), ed. Binyamin Oded, vol. 1, Jerusalem 1986, pp. 61–62; 67&lt;/ref&gt; (Open window for text)

Blessed is the Name of the Holy One, blessed be He, above and beyond all blessing, song and praise, or consolation, spoken in the universe. May my prayer and my supplication be acceptable, along with the prayer and supplication of the entire house of Israel before our Father who is in heaven. May there be abundant peace from heaven, and help and salvation and respite and favour and grace and mercies upon us and upon the entire congregation of the whole house of Israel, for life and for peace, and say ye, Amen. He that makes peace in His high places, He by his mercies and acts of loving kindness shall make peace upon us and upon all Israel, and He shall comfort us in Zion, and shall build by His mercies Jerusalem, even in our lifetime and in our days, soon to come. Amen and amen.

*The single individual who prays alone does not say the ''[[Kedushah|Keddusha]]'' (e.g. ''Qadosh'', ''Qadosh'', ''Qadosh''), but rather says, “''Keddushath Adonai Tzevo'oth''” ({{Lang-he-n|'''קדושת יי' צבאות'''}}), in lieu of the words ''Qadosh'', ''Qadosh'', ''Qadosh'', insofar that the Talmud &lt;small&gt;(''Berakhoth'' 21b)&lt;/small&gt; requires a quorum of at least ten adult males to say the ''Keddusha''.&lt;ref&gt;Siddur ''Siyach Yerushalayim'' (ed. Rabbi Yosef Qafih), vol. 1 (7th edition), Kiryat-Ono 2010, p. 31; ''Tiklāl Torath Avoth'' (ed. Nathanel Alsheikh), vol. 1, Benei Barak 1996, p. 30, ''et al''. The ''Shulchan Aruch'' (''Orach Chaim'' § 59:3) cites the matter as being disputed, and sides with the view that a single individual praying alone can say the ''Keddusha''. Even so, the Yemenite Jewish practice is to rely upon a very old practice mentioned in several writings of the ''Geonim'', namely: The teaching brought down in ''Halachoth Gedoloth'', (''Halachoth Tzitzith''), by Shimon Kiara which says, “They asked [the question] before R. Naḥshon, the Exilarch of the academy at Matha Maḥaseya, 'How shall a man pray when he is alone?' He answered them, 'Let him say 'yotzer or' in its regular manner, until he reaches ''we-khūlam pōthǝḥim eth piham biqǝḏūsha u'vǝṭaharoh u'mǝshabeḥim u'mǝvorekhim u'maqdishim lǝ'el shǝmō ho-el ha-ğoḏōl ha-ğibbōr wa-hanōro''. Afterwards, let him say the Psalms [which we are accustomed to say, namely], ''weyomeru,'' [etc.] and ''we-tushbehoth yashmi'ou'' [etc.], at which he concludes his prayer. '''But why is it that he skips over [the part of] holiness (''Keddusha'')? Because he is praying alone, and it is not permitted that a lone prayer says the holiness (''Keddusha'')'''.”  Although the version used by the Yemenites in their prayer books (''Tiklal'') is different from the version used by the '' [[Geonim#The title "Gaon"|Gaon]] '', they nevertheless adhered to his stringency. Other ''Geonim'', who have taken the like position, are:
'''a)'''	R. Tzemach Gaon (Brought down in the words of the ''Tur'', ''Orach Chaim''  § 132).
'''b)'''	R. Saadia Gaon (Brought down in the complete ''Seder of Rav Amram'', page 97)
'''c)'''	R. Amram Gaon (''ibid''.)
'''d)'''	Netronai Gaon. 
RAMBAM (Maimonides) ruled in accordance with the stringent ruling of the ''Geonim'' in his ''Mishne Torah'' (''Hil. Tefillah'' 7: 17), and which ruling is understood by some to mean that Rambam recanted his statement in his Questions &amp; Responsa, ''responsum'' # 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Megillat Antiochus'' ===
One of the more salient features of all the older Baladi-rite prayer books,&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi [[Yosef Kapach]], [https://www.otzar.org/wotzar/book.aspx?7871&amp;lang=eng Daniel], p. ריט.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as those compiled by Rabbi Yiḥya Bashiri, is the Aramaic ''[[Megillat Antiochus]]''&lt;ref&gt;The Yemenite tradition is to pronounce אַנְטְיּוּכַס, not אַנְטִיּוֹכוּס (Rabbi [[Yosef Kapach]], [https://www.otzar.org/wotzar/book.aspx?7871&amp;lang=eng Daniel], p. ריט and רכו; as heard in recording of Rabbi Salem Cohen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoIG-8VHYVM thereto].).&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Saadia Gaon]]'s Arabic translation, the original Aramaic being written by the elders of the Schools of Shammai and Hillel.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''Sefer Ha-Tiklāl'' (''Tiklal Qadmonim''), ed. Yosef Ḥubārah, Jerusalem 1964, pp. 75b–79b, s.v. מגלת בני חשמונאי&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tractate Avoth ===
According to 16th–17th century Yemenite prayer books, many Yemenites, but not all, recited but only the first chapter of Avoth after the Shabbath Minchah prayer, doing so throughout the entire year.&lt;ref&gt;''TEMA - Journal of Judeo-Yemenite Studies'' (Issue 5), (Netanya, Winter 1995, article: ''Yemenite Customs in Reciting Tractate Avoth on Shabbath'' (Shim'on Sharvit), p. 45–46. (Hebrew.)&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the 17th century, external influence&lt;ref&gt;''TEMA - Journal of Judeo-Yemenite Studies'' (Issue 5), (Netanya, Winter 1995, article: ''Yemenite Customs in Reciting Tractate Avoth on Shabbath'' (Shim'on Sharvit), p. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;—just as with the Shami prayer text—brought about completely changed customs, with the prevalent custom today being to read the entire tractate throughout the Sabbaths between Passover and Shavuoth, a chapter each Shabbath as non-Yemenite Jews customarily do.&lt;ref&gt;''TEMA - Journal of Judeo-Yemenite Studies'' (Issue 5), (Netanya, Winter 1995, article: ''Yemenite Customs in Reciting Tractate Avoth on Shabbath'' (Shim'on Sharvit), p. 45, 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Yosef Shalom Koraḥ was quoted&lt;ref&gt;In a conversation with [[Shimon Garidi|Shimon Gareidi]] regarding the learning of [[Pirkei Avoth]] in Yemen.&lt;/ref&gt; as pointing out that in the synagogues of Rabbi [[Yihya Qafih|Yiḥye Qafih]] and Rabbi Yiḥye al-Abyadh, rather than apportioning the learning for the Sabbaths between [[Pesaḥ]] and [[Shavuot|Atzeret]],&lt;ref&gt;עצרת (rather than שבועות) appears here in the source, reflecting Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih]]'s note that the Shavuoth holiday was also called "עצרת" in Yemen (Halichoth Teiman, [https://web.archive.org/web/20141016032948/http://www.chayas.com/gavshav.pdf#page=2 p. 29]). Cf. [[Schottenstein Edition of the Babylonian Talmud]], Sanhedrin, 101a ("בהלכות עצרת בעצרת"), note 11.&lt;/ref&gt; they would learn the entire tractate with [[Maimonides]]' commentary during the two days of [[Shavuoth]].&lt;ref&gt;שמעון גרידי, למוד תורה בתימן, מהדורה שנייה, תל אביב תשמ"ז as cited in Tema, #5 (Winter 1995), Yemenite Customs in Reciting Tractate Avoth on Shabbath, p. 53. (Hebrew.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First night of Shavuoth ===
The old Yemenite siddurim did not mention anything unique about the night of ''Shavuoth'' compared to other holidays; the practice relating to the [[Shavuot#Tikkun Leil Shavuot|Tikkun]] came to Yemen only from approximately the second half of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="Halichoth Teiman page 32"&gt;Rabbi Yosef Qafih, ''Halichoth Teiman'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, while in most of the synagogues in Yemen they would learn the "Tikkūn" printed in [[Machzor]]im and Sefardic [[Siddurim]], in some they would learn the [[Sefer Hamitzvot]] compiled by Maimonides, while by Rabbi [[Yihya Qafih]] it was learnt in its original Arabic.&lt;ref name="Halichoth Teiman page 32" /&gt; Even among the Baladi-rite congregations in Sana'a who embraced [[Kabbalah]], they received with some reservation the custom of the ''kabbalists'' to recite the "Tikkūn" all throughout the night, and would only recite the "Tikkūn" until about midnight, and then retire to their beds.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Ratzon Arussi, who cites Rabbi Shalom Yitzḥaq Halevi and Rabbi Shalom Qoraḥ, in article: "The Polemical Responsa touching the Blessing when Breaking Bread at a Supper where many are Reclined," published in: ''Tzohar le'ḥasifath ginzei teiman'' (Heb. צהר לחשיפת גנזי תימן), ed. Yehuda Levi Nahum &amp; Yosef Tobi, Tel-Aviv 1986, p. 305 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other features peculiar to the Baladi-rite ==
* On the night of Passover, the Baladi-rite [[Siddur]] requires making four separate blessings over the four cups of wine prior to drinking them, as prescribed by the ''Geonim'' and the Jerusalem Talmud.&lt;ref name="Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim"&gt;''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Yemenite custom is to make a blessing over the hand washing prior to dipping a morsel (''karpas'') into a liquid, especially during the night of Passover.&lt;ref&gt;''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim'', s.v. Passover. Compare ''[[Tosafot]]'' on ''Pesahim'' 115a-b, s.v. כל שטיבולו במשקה צריך נטילה, where it states at the very end of the Tosafist's response that "in '''all of the Siddurim''' it was written that a person is required to bless [over hand washing made when dipping a morsel into a liquid]," although the Tosafist dissented with that view. Today, the '''only''' Siddur which requires blessing over the hand washing when dipping a morsel into a liquid (such as at ''Pesach'' - Passover) is the Yemenite Baladi-rite Siddur. All other ''Siddurim'' have since changed their custom in accordance with the view of the Tosafist.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The blessing over the [[Hanukkah]] candles is with the preposition "of" (Heb. של), as in: ברוך אתה יי' אלהינו מלך העולם אשר קדשנו במצותיו וצונו להדליק נר &lt;big&gt;שֶׁלַּחֲנֻכָּה&lt;/big&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;The Sephardic tradition differs, in that it omits the word "of." See: ''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Baladi-rite custom requires making the blessing, "to dwell in the ''Sukkah''," each time one enters his makeshift booth during the seven days of ''Sukkoth'', even though he had not intended to eat a meal there, in accordance with teachings brought down by Rabbi [[Isaac ibn Ghiyyat]] (1038–1089)&lt;ref&gt;Isaac ibn Ghiyyat, ''Sefer Sha'arei Simcha'' (ed. Yitzḥaq Dov Halevi Bomberger), vol. 1 (''Hilkot Sukkah''), Firta 1861, p. 87 (end)&lt;/ref&gt;  and by Maimonides.&lt;ref&gt;''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim''; cf. Mishne Torah, ''Hil. Sukkah'' 6:12&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Grace said after meals (Heb. ברכת המזון) shows an old format, lacking the additions added in subsequent generations by other communities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob ben Asher|Rabbeinu Ya'akov]], the son of [[Asher ben Jehiel|Rabbeinu Asher]] (the ''Rosh''), says in his ''Tur'' (''Orach Chaim'' § 189:1) that the fourth blessing known as "the good and the benevolent" had been expanded in later generations to include the words:  "He hath been good unto us, He doeth good unto us, (and) He will do good unto us." This addition is missing in the old Yemenite version of the Grace said after meals. However, the same addition has been prescribed also by ''Tosafoth'' (''Berakhoth'' 46b), s.v. והטוב, and by [[Yonah Gerondi|Rabbeinu Yonah]], who all require saying these words in accordance with a homily brought down by Rabbi [[David Abudirham]]. Even so, Rabbi Ya'akov in his ''Tur'' (ibid.) admits that it is only a later practice, and was not originally part of the fourth blessing – the good and the benevolent.&lt;/ref&gt; (Open window for text)

| Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who sustaineth the whole world with goodness, with loving-kindness and with mercy, and whose great goodness hath never been wanting unto us, nor will it ever be wanting, [even] unto eternity. For He it is who sustaineth, and feedeth and doth provide sustenance to all, as has been said: 'Opening up thy hand, and satisfying every living thing with favour, and providing food to all His creatures that He did create.' Blessed art thou O Lord who sustaineth all.&lt;ref&gt;The Babylonian Talmud (''Berakhoth'' 48b) teaches us that from the mere standpoint of the Law, it is only necessary to say "Thank-you, God, for this meal," and one has fulfilled thereby his obligations. However, when God gave manna to the Israelites in the wilderness, Moses enacted that Israel make use of a set formula when blessing God after eating it, which enactment constitutes the first part of the blessing that we now make use of today in our Grace. When the Israelites entered the land of Canaan, Joshua enacted that we say an additional blessing after that which Moses gave us, in recognition of the good land. By the time that King David and Solomon came along, they enacted a third blessing, in recognition of the building of Jerusalem and its Temple, adding this blessing immediately after that which was given by Joshua. These three blessings constitute what is known as the '''Grace after meals''' (Heb. ''birkath hamazon''). Afterwards, in ''circa'' 132 CE, the Sages of Jamnia (''Yavne'') added a fourth and final blessing to these original three, requiring us to say "the good and benevolent King," in remembrance of God's mercies to the slain at Beter (''Beth Tor''),  who were killed during the days of Hadrian, during the Jewish insurrection against Roman occupation. The slain had long been without burial, by order of the Roman Emperor, but eventually were afforded a burial – when a new emperor came to power in Rome  – but only after their corpses had been left strewn in the fields to form hedges for Hadrian's vineyard. It is said that during this time, their bodies never gave-off a putrefying smell or stench, a thing seen as a reflection of God's goodness towards the fallen and the slain (See: Babylonian Talmud, ''Taanith'' 31a).&lt;/ref&gt; || ברוך אתה יי' אלהינו מלך העולם הזן את העולם כולו בטוב בחן בחסד וברחמים וטובו הגדול לא חסר לנו ואל יחסר לנו לעולם ועד כי הוא זן ומזין ומפרנס לכל כאמור פותח את ידך ומשביע לכל חי רצון ומכין מזון לכל בריותיו אשר ברא. ברוך אתה יי' הזן את הכל.

| We thank thee, O Lord our God, and we bless thee, our King, for thou hast caused our fathers to inherit a pleasant land, one which is good and broad, [and hast given us] a covenant and a Law, [and especially] for thy taking us out of the land of Egypt, and thy having redeemed us from the house of bondage; but [also] for thy Law which thou hast taught us, and for the ordinances of thy will which thou hast made known unto us.&lt;ref&gt;Here, on the eight days of ''Hanukkah'', one must add the following praise: “For the miracles, and for the valiant acts, and for the wars, and for the Divine help, and for the redemption, and for the deliverance, which thou hast wrought for us and with our forefathers during those days at this time; [even] during the days of Mattithiah, the son of Yoḥanan the High Priest, the Ḥasmonai and his sons, when the wicked kingdom of Greece stood up against thy people, the house of Israel, to make them desist from thy Divine laws, and to draw them away from the precepts determined by thee. However, thou, in thy great mercies, stood up for them in their time of trouble, and judged their case, and contended their contention, and took revenge upon their vengeance, delivering valiant men into the hand of the weak, and a multitude of people into the hand of the few, and those who were defiled into the hand of those who were pure, and the wicked into the hand of the righteous, and transgressors into the hand of those who keep thy Divine laws, and hast made for thyself a great name in thy worlds, and for thy people hast thou wrought a wonder and miracles. Just as thou hast done for them miracles and mighty acts, so do thou even for us miracles and mighty acts during this time and season.” (Heb. על הנסים ועל הגבורות ועל המלחמות ועל התשועות ועל הפדות ועל הפרקן שעשית עמנו ועם אבותינו בימים ההם בזמן הזה. בימי מתתיה בן יוחנן כהן גדול חַשְׁמוּנַּאי ובניו כשעמדה מלכות יון הָרִשְׁעָה על עמך בית ישראל לבטלם מתורתיך ולהעבירם מחקי רצוניך ואתה ברחמיך הרבים עמדת להם בעת צרתם ודנת את דינם ורבת את ריבם ונקמת את נקמתם ומסרת גבורים ביד חלשים ורבים ביד מעטים וטמאים ביד טהורים ורשעים ביד צדיקים ופושעים ביד עושי תורתיך ועשית לך שם גדול בעולמיך  ולעמך ישראל עשית פלא ונסים. כשם שעשית עמהם נסים וגבורות כך עשה עמנו נסים וגבורות בעת ובעונה הזאת)&lt;/ref&gt; All of which things, O Lord our God, we give thanks unto you, and bless thy name, as it has been said: 'When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.'

* The "[[Counting of the Omer]]" (''sefirath ha-ʻomer'') between Passover and ''[[Shavu'ot]]h'' is said in Aramaic, rather than in Hebrew. The emissary of the congregation (''Shaliach Tzibbur'') commences by making one blessing over the counting and fulfills thereby the duty of the entire congregation, although each man makes the counting for himself.&lt;ref name="Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shalom Yitzhak Halevi, ''Divrei Shalom Ḥakhamim'' (ed. Avner Yitzhak Halevi), Jerusalem 1993, p. 451, § 99 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The textual variant of the third benediction (''Ḳeddushah'') said in the [[Mussaf]] Prayer on Sabbath days shows signs of an early tradition, believed to antedate the version used by other communities (both, Ashkenaz and Sepharad), insofar that the original version was said without mentioning ''Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Eḥad''.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Gavra, ''Meḥqarim basiddurei tayman: Studies in the Prayer Books of Yemen'', vol. 2, Benei Barak 2010, pp. 232–233). An early 9th century Babylonian scholar, Pirkoi ben Baboi, in a document originally preserved in the Old Cairo [[Cairo Geniza|Geniza at Fusṭaṭ]]  (now in the Cambridge Univ. Library, Taylor-Schecter Collection, T-S NS 275.27, published in ''Ginzei Schechter'' by Louis Ginzberg, book 2, Jewish Theological Seminary of America:Hermon 1969, pp. 544–573) makes note of the fact that during the persecutions under the Roman-Byzantine emperors, there was a decree which prohibited Jews from reciting the ''Shema'' (Hear, O Israel) verses, but in order to circumvent this prohibition, Jews had inserted the addition of ''Shema'' (Hear, O Israel) in the Mussaf Prayer on Sabbath days. However, when the persecutions ceased, the recital of the ''Shema'' in the Mussaf remained the norm for most communities, whereas Pirkoi ben Baboi implores the Jews of North Africa to return to their original practice, calling their continuance in such practices as being no more than “customs of abjuration.” In the view of Rabbi [[Yihya Qafih|Yihya al-Qafih]] (''Milḥamoth Hashem'', 1931), as well as [[Maharitz (Yihya Salah)|Maharitz]] (see ''infra''.), who allege that the original Yemenite Jewish custom in the third benediction on Sabbath days was not to say ''Kether yitenu lekha'', etc., but only to make use of the third benediction said on weekdays (e.g. נקדישך וכו), it would seem that the newer Baladi-rite custom to say ''Kether yitenu lekha'', etc., follows the old custom in the Land of Israel (as described in the [[Zohar]], ''Parashat Pinḥas'') before the changes took effect in consequence of those persecutions. Even so, the Zohar makes it clear that saying, ''"Kether yitenu lekha,"'' etc. was only a later enactment. Compare [[Maharitz (Yihya Salah)|Maharitz]], ''Tiklāl 'Etz Ḥayim Hashalem'' (ed. Shimon Tzalach), vol. 1, ''Mussaf shel-shabbath'', s.v. כתר, Jerusalem 1971, p. 218a; p. 289b in other editions (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; (Open window for text)

* The Evening Prayer ([[Arvit|ʻArvith]]) on weekdays is unique in that, in the second blessing said after ''Ḳiryat Shema'', there is an extension enacted by the [[Geonim]], now abandoned by  most other communities.&lt;ref&gt;Their enactment was to say the addition, beginning with the words,  ברוך שומר עמו ישראל לעד. ברוך יי' לעולם אמן ואמן. ימלוך יי' לעולם אמן ואמן, etc., in the second blessing after ''Ḳiryat Shema'', and which addition was intended to prolong the time of prayer in the synagogues for late-comers, so that they could still arrive in time to pray with the congregation when they reached the [[Amidah|Standing Prayer]], without being compelled to remain there alone when the congregants had all departed from the synagogue and walked to their homes at night. Synagogues were then built in fields at a distance outside of the city and there was a concern for their safety when returning home alone at night. For a greater summary of the Geonic enactment, which was once also practised by the Spanish Jewish community before they eventually broke away from its practice, see: Rabbi Menahem of the House of Meir (Ha-Meiri), ''Beit Ha-beḥirah'', vol. 1 (''Berakhot'', s.v.  וסמיכת גאולה לתפלה), Jerusalem 2006, p. 9 (Hebrew); Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim&lt;/ref&gt; (Open window for text)

| Cause us, O Lord our God, to lie down in peace, and cause us, O our King, to rise again unto life and peace. Spread over us the tabernacle of thy peace, while directing us aright through thine own good counsel. Protect us and preserve us, and deliver us from every kind of evil, as also from the fear of the night.&lt;ref&gt;In some older Baladi-rite Prayer Books, the version here is as follows: "Protect us and preserve us, and deliver us from every thing, as also from the fear of the day and from the fear of the night, etc." (See: ''Sefer Ha-Tiklāl'' [''Tiklāl Qadmonim''], ed.  Yosef Ḥubārah, Jerusalem 1964, p. 13a, note 5; Moshe Gavra, ''Meḥqarim basiddūrei teiman'', vol. 1, Benei Barak 2010, pp. 443–444)&lt;/ref&gt; May you break Satan, from before us and after us, and guard our going out and our coming in, for Thou art our Keeper and our Deliverer. May you hide us under the shadow of thy wings, as it is said, ‘Behold! He shall not slumber, nor sleep, the Keeper of Israel.’ || השכיבנו יי' אלהינו לשלום והעמידנו מלכנו לחיים ולשלום. ופרוש עלינו סוכת שלומך ותקננו בעצה טובה מלפניך והגן בעדנו. ושמרנו והצילנו מכל דבר רע ומפחד לילה. ושבור השטן מלפנינו ומאחורינו. ושמור צאתנו ובואנו כי שומרנו ומצילנו אתה. ובצל כנפיך תסתירנו כדבר שנאמר הנה לא ינום ולא יישן שומר ישראל

| &lt;small&gt;(''Geonic Addition'')&lt;/small&gt; Blessed is He who keeps his people, Israel, forever. Blessed be the Lord forever! Amen and amen! May the Lord reign forever! Amen and amen! Now all the people had seen [it] and had fallen down upon their faces, and they said, ‘The Lord, He is God! The Lord, He is God!’ Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from the nations in order to praise thy holy Name, even to garner praise in thy fame, for the Lord shall not forsake His people for His great namesake, for the Lord was pleased to make you His people. Deliverers shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau, and the kingdom shall then be the Lord’s. And the Lord shall be a King over all the earth; on that day, the Lord shall be One, and His Name One. Our God who art in heaven, perpetuate thy Name and thy kingdom upon us always. In thine hand is the soul of those who are living, as also the soul of those who are dead; in whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of every human flesh. In thine hand will I commit my spirit; Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, the God of truth! Now we are thy people, and the sheep of thy pasture. We shall thank thee forever, throughout all generations, and shall tell of thy fame. O Lord, deliver my soul from a mendacious lip, even from a deceitful tongue.  Israel shall be saved in the Lord [with] an everlasting salvation. You shall not be ashamed, neither shall you be dismayed, forever more. May the Lord our God be with us, just as He was with our fathers. May He never leave us, nor forsake us, [but] incline our heart unto Him, so that [we] might walk in all His ways, and keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments which He has commanded our fathers. Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord, Halleujah! Blessed be the Lord in the day; blessed be the Lord in the night. Blessed be the Lord in the morning; blessed be the Lord in the evening. Blessed be the Lord in our lying down; blessed be the Lord in our rising up. We shall always praise thee, forever, and speak of thy faithfulness. Blessed art thou, O Lord, He who reigns in His glory, who lives and exists always, may He reign forever and ever. Amen. ||ברוך שומר עמו ישראל לעד. ברוך יי' לעולם אמן ואמן. ימלוך יי' לעולם אמן ואמן. וירא כל העם ויפלו על פניהם ויאמרו יי' הוא האלהים. יי' הוא האלהים. הושיענו יי' אלהינו וקבצנו מן הגוים להודות לשם קדשך להשתבח בתהלתך. כי לא יטוש יי' את עמו בעבור שמו הגדול כי הואיל יי' לעשות אתכם לו לעם. ועלו מושעים בהר ציון לשפוט את הר עשו והיתה ליי' המלוכה. והיה יי' למלך על כל הארץ. ביום ההוא יהיה יי' אחד ושמו אחד. אלהינו שבשמים קים שמך ומלכותך עלינו תמיד. בידך נפש החיים ונפש המתים. אשר בידו נפש כל חי ורוח כל בשר איש. בידך אפקיד רוחי פדית אותי יי' אל אמת. ואנחנו עמך וצאן מרעיתך נודה לך לעולם לדור ודור נספר תהלתך. יי' הצילה נפשי משפת שקר מלשון רמיה. ישראל נושע ביי' תשועת עולמים לא תבושו ולא תכלמו עד עולמי עד. יהי יי' אלהינו עמנו כאשר היה עם אבותינו אל יעזבנו ואל יטשנו. להטות לבבנו אליו ללכת בכל דרכיו ולשמור מצותיו וחקיו ומשפטיו אשר צוה את אבותינו. כל הנשמה תהלל יה הללויה. ברוך יי' ביום ברוך יי' בלילה. ברוך יי' בבקר. ברוך יי' בערב. ברוך יי' בשכבנו. ברוך יי' בקומנו. תמיד נהללך סלה ונשיח באמונתך. ברוך אתה יי' המולך בכבודו חי וקים תמיד. ימלוך לעולם ועד אמן

* The third blessing of the Amidah retains the same form throughout the [[Ten Days of Repentance]], even on weekdays, with the addition of &lt;big&gt;ובכן&lt;/big&gt;.
* In Yemenite public service (both, Baladi and Shāmī), the ''[[pesukei dezimra]]'' of the Morning Prayer is chanted in unison by the whole sitting congregation, unlike other communities where only one person, usually the ''Shaliach Tzibbur'' (precentor), recites it aloud.&lt;ref&gt;''Judaeo-Yemenite Studies - Proceedings of the Second International Congress'', Ephraim Isaac &amp; Yosef Tobi (ed.), Introduction, Princeton University 1999, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The same rule applies to the recital of the ''Qiryath Shema''.&lt;ref&gt;In the last chapter of [[Song of Solomon]], where it says, "she who sitteth in the gardens, [thy] friends hearken to thy voice," it says that this verse refers to those who read the ''Qiryath Shema'' in perfect unison. (This practice has been so misconstrued by others, that to-day, many well-meaning worshippers have come to whisper the famous recital.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Yemenite public service (both, Baladi and Shāmī), only one person says the [[Kaddish]] at any given time, but never two or more simultaneously. Moreover, in every Kaddish the words &lt;big&gt;וְיִמְלוֹךְ מַלְכוּתֵיהּ וְיַצְמַח פּוּרְקָנֵיהּ וִיקָרֵב מְשִׁיחֵיהּ וְיִפְרוֹק עַמֵּיהּ&lt;/big&gt; are incorporated. The ''yod'' in the word וימלוך is vocalized with a ''[[ḥiraq]]'', and the ''lamad'' with a [[Holam|''ḥolam'']].&lt;ref name="Hashalem, Shimon Tzalach 1971"&gt;''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim Hashalem'', Shimon Tzalach (ed.), vol. 1, Jerusalem 1971, p. 39a (in some editions, p. 30a); ''Naḥalath Yosef'', Introduction, Shemuel b. Yosef Adeni, Jerusalem 1997 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The custom of the Baladi-rite is to answer "Amen" at the conclusion of the benediction known as ''Yotzer'' in the Morning Prayer, as also to answer "Amen" during the Evening Prayer at the conclusion of the benediction, ''Ma'ariv 'Aravim''.&lt;ref name="Hashalem, Shimon Tzalach 1971"/&gt;
* The ''[[Kohenim|Cohenim]]'' do not have a custom to wash their hands prior to their standing up to bless the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim Hashalem'', Shimon Tzalach (ed.), vol. 1, Jerusalem 1971, p. 39a-b (in some editions, p. 30b); ''Naḥalath Yosef'', Introduction, Shemuel b. Yosef Adeni, Jerusalem 1997 (Hebrew). Compare ''[[Shulhan Arukh]]'' (''[[Orach Chaim]]'' 128:6) and Rabbi Yaakov Castro's commentary, ''Arakh Leḥem'' (ibid.). The reason for the disparity in Jewish custom in this case is owing to the ambiguity of the teaching, which simply states that a Cohen (priest of Aaron's lineage) is not permitted to stand and bless the people with unwashed hands. The Yemenites hold this to mean the washing of hands in the morning, while others hold this to mean the washing of hands immediately prior to blessing the people.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On days when they read from two [[Torah scroll (Yemenite)|scrolls of the Torah]] in the synagogue, the Baladi-rite custom is not to take out the two scrolls at one time, but they would take out one scroll, read from it, and after the conclusion of the reading the scroll is returned to the ''[[Torah ark|Heikhal]]'' and the second scroll taken out and read. The ''[[Haftarah]]'' is read only after the scrolls have been returned to the ''Heikhal''.&lt;ref&gt;David ben Suleiman David Sassoon, ''Bo'ī Teman'', Budapest 1924, p. 12 (s.v. The Order of Returning the Book of the Law in accordance with the People of Yemen) [Hebrew]; It is worthy of noting that the Yemenite usage here is identical to the ancient practice described in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], ''Sotah'' 7:6; 33b ("Rabbi Yose commanded Bar Ulla the overseer of the Synagogue of the Babylonians [saying that] whenever only one Torah scroll [is read] let him return it behind the curtain. Whenever there are two [Torah scrolls], carry one away, and bring the other"), where it can be inferred that the Palestinian Jews in the 'Babylonian Synagogue' returned the sacred scrolls before reading the ''Haftarah'', and secondly that they did not take out two Torah scrolls simultaneously. The same customs were in vogue among the Yemenite Jews.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Solomon Sassoon, ''Ohel Dawid - Descriptive Catalogue of the Hebrew and Samaritan Manuscripts in the Sassoon Library, London'', vol. 2, Oxford University Press: London 1932, p. 934&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Baladi-rite custom, on any given Monday or Thursday, as well as on ''Rosh Ḥodesh'' (New Moon), is to return the Scroll of the Law (Torah) to the ark after reading it in the synagogue, before the congregation recites ''Ashrei yosh&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;vei veth&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;kha, 'odh yehallelukha seloh'', etc. (אשרי יושבי ביתך עוד יהללוך סלה). This rule, however, does not apply to Sabbath days and Festival days.&lt;ref&gt;''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim Hashalem'', Shimon Tzalach (ed.), vol. 1, Jerusalem 1971, p. 39a-b (in some editions, p. 30b); ''Naḥalath Yosef'', Introduction, Shemuel b. Yosef Adeni, Jerusalem 1997 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Yemenite custom (both, Baladi and Shāmī) when reciting the ''[[Hallel]]'' is that the congregation attentively listens to the ''[[Shaliach tzibbur|Shaliach Tzibbur]]'' reading without repeating the words of the ''Hallel'', but only cites the word "Hallelujah," in a repetitious manner, after each verse. "Hallelujah" is repeated 123 times, like the number of years attained by Aaron the High Priest. The congregation will, however, repeat after the ''Shaliach Tzibbur'' only a few selected verses from the ''Hallel'', considered as lead verses.&lt;ref&gt;This practice is mentioned in the [[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Sukkah'' 38b and in ''Tractate Sofrim'' (chapter 16). Cf. Maimonides, ''Hil. Hanukkah'' 3:12.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Tikkun Chatzot]]'' (Midnight Rectification) does not appear in the Baladi-rite liturgies.

[''In summer add:'' Thou causest the dew to fall. / ''In winter add:'' Thou makest the wind to blow, and causest the rain to fall.] Thou sustainest the living with loving-kindness, and in great mercy bringeth back to life those who were dead. Thou healest the sick, upholdest those who fall, settest free those that are in bondage, and keepest faith with those that sleep in the dust. Who is like unto Thee, Thou who art most Omnipotent? Or, who can be compared to Thee, Thou who decreest death and life? Yet, faithful art Thou to resurrect the dead.

(''On the night when the Sabbath departs, this benediction is said instead''): Thou endowest man with knowledge and teachest mortal man understanding, and Thou hast distinguished between the holy and the profane, and between light and darkness, and between Israel and the nations; between the seventh day and the six working days. Just as Thou hast distinguished between the holy and the profane, so, too, redeem us and save us from all kinds of destructive forces, and from all kinds of tribulations that stir-up to come forth into the world, keeping us from all such things, and grant us knowledge, understanding and wisdom. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who bestowest knowledge upon man. || אַתָּה חוֹנֵן לָאָדָם דַּעַת וּמלַמֵּד לֶאֱנוֹשׁ בִּינָה. חָנֵּנוּ מֵאִתָּךְ דֵּעָה וּבִינָה וְהַשׂכֵּל. בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ' חוֹנֵן הַדָּעַת (''במוצאי שבת אומרים במקומו''): אַתָּה חוֹנֵן לָאָדָם דַּעַת וּמְלַמֵּד לֶאֱנוֹשׁ בִּינָה. וְאַתָּה הִבְדַּלְתָּ בֵּין קֹדֶשׁ לַחוֹל וּבֵין אוֹר לַחֹשֶׁךְ וּבֵין יִשְׂרָאֵל לַגּוֹיִם וּבֵין יוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי לְשֵׁשֶׁת יְמֵי הַמַּעֲשֶׂה. כְּשֵׁם שֶׁהִבְדַּלְתָּ בֵּין קֹדֶשׁ לַחוֹל, כָּךְ פְּדֵנוּ וְהַצִילֵנוּ מִכָּל מִינֵי מַשְׁחִית וּמִכָּל מִינֵי פוּרְעָנִיּוֹת הַמִּתְרַגְּשׁוֹת לָבוֹא בָעוֹלָם וְשָׁמְרֵנוּ מִן הַכֹּל וְחָנֵּנוּ מֵאִתָּךְ דֵּעָה וּבִינָה וְהַשְׂכֵּל. בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ' חוֹנֵן הַדָּעַת

| Bring us back, O our Father, to Thy divine Law (Torah), and draw us near, O our King, to Thy divine service, and bring us unto complete repentance before Thee. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who desirest repentance. || הֲשִׁיבֵנוּ אָבִינוּ לְתוֹרָתֶיךָ וְקָרְבֵנוּ מַלכֵּנוּ לַעֲבוֹדָתֶךָ וְהַחזִירֵנוּ בִּתשׁוּבָה שְׁלֵמָה לְפָנֶיךָ. בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ' הָרוֹצֶה בַּתְּשׁוּבָה

| Forgive us, O our Father, for we have sinned. Pardon us, O our King, for we have transgressed. Verily Thou art a merciful and forgiving God. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who art gracious and abundant in forgiveness. || סְלַח לָנוּ אָבִינוּ כִּי חָטָאנוּ, מְחוֹל לָנוּ מַלכֵּנוּ כִּי פָשָׁענוּ. כִּי אֵל טוֹב וְסַלָּח אָתָּה. בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ' חַנּוּן וּמַרבֶּה לִסלוֹחַ

| Heal us, O Lord our God, and we shall be healed. Deliver us and we shall be saved. Grant, moreover, complete healing for all our ailments, for Thou art a God who is a merciful Healer. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who healest the sick among Thy people Israel. || רְפָאֵנוּ יְיָ' אֱלֹהֵינוּ וְנֵרָפֵא. הוֹשִׁיעֵנוּ וְנִוָּשֵׁעָה, וְהַעֲלֵה רְפוּאָה שְׁלֵמָה לְכָל תַּחֲלוּאֵינוּ כִּי אֵל רוֹפֵא רַחֲמָן אָתָּה. בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ' רוֹפֵא חוֹלֵי עַמּוֹ יִשׂרָאֵל

| (''In the winter, say:'') Bless us,&lt;ref&gt;The Yemenite tradition differs from the Sephardic tradition, insofar that the Sephardic Jews will say during the winter months, "Bless [this year] unto us" ('''ברך עלינו'''), but the Yemenites will say, both in the winter months and in the summer months, "Bless us" ('''ברכנו'''), without distinction.&lt;/ref&gt; O Lord our God, in all the works of our hands. And do Thou bless this year, by giving dew and rain upon the face of the [dry] earth. Fill the entire world with Thy goodness, and satisfy the face of the inhabitable earth with the richness of Thy giving hands. Moreover, O Lord our God, watch and deliver this year, with all its produce, from all kinds of destruction, and from all kinds of afflictions. Let her substance remain, and let there be hope, and satisfaction, and peace, just as in the good years.

| Look with favour, O Lord, our God, upon Thy people Israel, and upon their prayer. Restore the divine worship to the inner sanctum of Thine house, as also the sacrificial offerings of Israel thy people. With loving favour, quickly accept their prayer, and may the divine worship of Israel Thy people always find favour with Thee. (''On Rosh Hodesh, add:'' Our God and our God of our fathers, may our remembrance and the remembrance of our forefathers come before Thee, as well as the remembrance of Thy city, Jerusalem, as also the remembrance of the Messiah the son of David, Thy servant. So, too, the remembrance of all Thy people, the house of Israel, may it come before Thee, by granting them deliverance and well-being, and may it abound to our blessing, and to our favour and loving kindness, and mercy, even on this New lunar month; On it, have mercy upon us, and deliver us. On it, be mindful of us, O Lord our God, in what concerns our good. On it, remember us for a life of blessing. On it, deliver us unto life, even in what concerns Thy promise of salvation and mercy. Take pity upon us and favour us, and show us mercy. And, on it, deliver us from all trouble and anguish, while causing us to be exceedingly happy on it, for Thou art a God and King that is merciful and compassionate.) Thus, favouring us, our eyes shall see when Thou returnest unto Thy dwelling-place, even unto Zion, with mercies as at former times. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who bringest again His Divine Presence to Zion. || רְצֵה יְיָ' אֱלֹהֵינוּ בְּעַמְּךָ יִשׂרָאֵל וְלִתפִלָּתָם שְׁעֵה. וְהָשֵׁב הָעֲבוֹדָה אֶל דְּבִיר בֵּיתֶךָ וְאִשֵּׁי יִשׂרָאֵל. וּתפִלָּתָם מְהֵרָה תְקַבֵּל בְּרָצוֹן וּתהִי לְרָצוֹן תָּמִיד עֲבוֹדַת יִשׂרָאֵל עַמֶּךָ.

Thou art He who is good, for Thy mercies have never ceased. Thou art He who is merciful, for Thy loving-kindness will never fail. All of the living shall praise Thy great name, since goodness is ascribed unto the good God.

|[Translation]:

The breath of every living thing&lt;/big&gt; shall bless Thy name, O Lord our God! And the spirit of all flesh shall ever glorify and extol Thy memory, O our King! For generation after generation, from everlasting unto everlasting, Thou art God! But for Thee, there is no G-d; neither do we have any King, Redeemer or Deliverer in all times of trouble and distress but Thee! He that redeems and rescues; He that gives sustenance and shows mercy, even the G-d of all living creatures, the Lord of all generations that were ever born! Thou art He that is extolled by their praises! He that rules His world with loving kindness and His creatures with manifold tender mercies; Now the Lord God is the truth, He does not slumber, neither does He sleep. Thou art He that arouses those that sleep, and awakenest those that slumber; He that upholds those that fall, who heals the sick, who loosens those that are bound; it is to Thee that we give thanks.
 
Were our mouths filled with song as the sea, our tongues with joyful praise as the multitude of its waves, and our lips with adoration as the spacious firmament; were our eyes radiant as the sun and the moon, and our hands spread forth like the eagles of the sky, and our feet swift as hinds, we would still be unable to thank Thee, O Lord our God, or to bless Thy name, our King, [as becometh Thee], be it for one measure of the thousands upon thousands, and the abundant myriads upon myriads of times which Thou hast done good unto us and unto our fathers in ages past!

From Egypt Thou didst redeem us, O Lord our G-d! From the house of bondage Thou didst ransom us! During famine Thou didst feed us, and in time of plenty Thou didst sustain us! From the sword Thou didst save us, and from pestilence Thou hast caused us to escape, and from many sore ailments Thou hast lifted us up, O our King! Hitherto, Thy tender mercies have helped us, O Lord our God, while Thy loving-kindness hast not forsaken us!

Therefore, the limbs which Thou hast fashioned in us, and the spirit and soul which Thou hast breathed into our nasals, and the tongue which Thou hast set in our mouth, lo, they, by joyous singing, shall thank Thee and shall bless Thy name, O Lord our God, over the abundance of Thy miraculous wonders! For every mouth shall to Thee give thanks, and every tongue shall to Thee give praise, and every eye unto Thee shall look, while every knee unto Thee shall bend, and all that standeth shall bow down before Thee. All hearts shall then revere Thee, and [man's] inmost being and reins shall sing to Thy name, as it is written: 'All my bones shall say: O Lord, who is like unto Thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?' &lt;small&gt;(Ps. 35:10)&lt;/small&gt;. And it is written: 'Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright.' &lt;small&gt;(Ps. 33:1)&lt;/small&gt;.

By the mouth of the upright, be Thou exalted! By the words of the righteous, be Thou blest! By the tongue of all pious men, be Thou sanctified! And in the midst of the holy, be Thou praised! While in the assemblies of the multitudes of Thy people, even the whole house of Israel, may Thy name be glorified, O Lord our God. For such is the duty of all creatures towards Thee, O Lord our God, to give thanks, to laud, to praise, to glorify, to exalt, to magnify and to honour, even beyond all the words of song and praise uttered by David, the son of Jesse, Thine anointed!

==Baladi as original Yemenite custom==
Although the word "Baladi" is used to denote the traditional Yemenite [[Jewish prayer]], the word is also used to designate the old Yemenite Jewish custom in many non-related issues treating on Jewish legal law ([[Halacha]]) and ritual practices, and which laws are mostly aligned with the teachings of [[Maimonides]]' ''Code of Jewish Law'', as opposed to the ''[[Shulchan Arukh]]'' of Rabbi [[Joseph Karo]].

*One of such practices is to constrict the blood locked within meats before cooking by throwing cut pieces of the meat (after salting and rinsing) into a pot of boiling water, and leaving them there for as long as it takes for the meat to whiten on its outer layer. This practice prevents the blood from oozing out, and is only a rabbinical precautionary measure (Cf. [[Hullin]] 111a).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Maimonides]], ''Mishne Torah'' (Hil. ''Ma'akhaloth Asuroth'' 6:7; 6:10)&lt;/ref&gt; If soup was to be made from meat which was thrown into a pot of boiling water, it was not necessary to take out the meat. Rather, the froth and scum which surfaces were scooped away, and this sufficed. It was also a Jewish practice in Yemen that when salting the cut meat, the pieces are prepared no larger than half a ''roṭal'' (about the size of half an orange) so as to permit the effectiveness of the salt on that meat.&lt;ref&gt;''Half of a roṭal'', was a weight used in Arab countries during the Middle-Ages, equivalent to about  216 grams, or about the size in bulk of half an orange. This practice follows the Yemenite custom, which differs from a late Commentary on the ''Shulchan Arukh'' by the name of TAZ (''[[Turei Zahav]]''), ''Yoreh De'ah'' 69:5:16, who writes that the pieces can be "very thick" when salting. The Yemenite practice follows Rabbi Saadiah Gaon, dating back to the year 930 of our Common Era, and who says the meat should not be larger than half a ''roṭal'' when salting. (Rabbi Saadiah Gaon's opinion is found in some earlier versions of R. Yitzhak al-Fasi's Commentary on Tractate ''Hullin'', chapter ''Kol habasar'', today only extant with the Yemenites, among whom a certain scholar of theirs made a Judeo-Arabic translation and commentary on al-Fasi's work, published by R. Yosef Qafih in 1960 CE under the title הרי"ף למסכת חולין).&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Baladi custom is to make ''[[tzitzit]]'' (tassels)&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 22:12&lt;/ref&gt; with only seven "joints" ({{Lang-he-n|'''חוליות'''}}), without counting the first square-knot that is tied to the tassel where it is attached to the cloth. These seven "joints" each consist of only three windings and are not separated by knots. They are placed on the upper 1/3 length of the tassel, symbolic of the seven firmaments in heaven, while in the other 2/3 length of the tassel the strings are left to hang loose. Their Rabbis have interpreted the Talmud (''Menahoth'' 39a) with a view that the "joints" and the "knots" are one and the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;So writes Rabbi Yihya Bashiri, in his Baladi-rite [[Siddur]] written in 1654, of which a microfilm copy is available at the Hebrew University library in Jerusalem (Givat Ram Campus), Manuscript Department, film no. F-38354 (Hebrew and [[Judeo-Arabic]]): “Any garment which consists of wool, or linen, or silk, or cotton, there is a biblical command that obligates him to attach thereto tassels with hitches (bindings) made-up of four strings, each of the strings being doubled to form eight threads. The four strings are inserted in the aperture made at the edge of the garment, less than 3 fingerbreadths in the corner of the garment, and then doubled so as to make eight threads, while one of them is longer [than the others] with which he binds the eight strings together. The hitches (bindings) are made each one of three windings, whereas the knot is what is called a hitch (binding). Thus is it required to be done on each of the four corners, to fulfill one’s duty in the Law…”. Cf. Maimonides, [[Mishne Torah]] (''Hil. Tzizith'' 1:6–8).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Talith with tassels (tzitzit), Rambam's method.jpg|thumb|right|Yemenite tzitzit]]
*Another custom of the Baladi-rite community (which is also true of the Shāmī-rite community) is for a child to read aloud the Aramaic translation ([[Targum]]) in the synagogues on Sabbath days, during the [[Parashah|weekly biblical lection]], as well as on holidays. The Aramaic translation is read one verse at a time, following each verse that is read aloud from the scroll of the Law (Torah), a practice long since abandoned by other communities.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Mishnah]] ''Megillah'' 4:4, Talmud ''Megillah'' 3a). In the book ''She'iltoth'' by [[Achai Gaon|Rav Ahai Gaon]] (P. ''Nitzavim'' § 161), he writes: "And when he reads [from the Torah], a translator must respond [to each verse], and they are to adjust the tone of their voices together [so that they are the same]. But if the translator cannot raise his voice, let the reader [from the Torah] lower his own voice."&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Baladi-rite custom of tying the knot ({{Lang-he-n|'''קשר'''}}) on the head phylactery ([[Tefillin]]) follows the custom mentioned in ''[[Halakhot Gedolot]]'' (''Hil. Shimushei Tefillin''): "One doubles the two heads (i.e. ends) of the straps [in the form of two separate loops] and feeds one through the other, and the head (i.e. end) of the one in the end (loop) of the other, so that there is formed thereby the shape of a ''daleth''." Practically speaking, its shape is only an imaginary ''daleth'', made also in accordance with the old manner prescribed by the Jews of Ashkenaz (an illustration of its tying method shown [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14556&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=627&amp;hilite= '''here''']).&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer Halakhot Gedolot'' (ed. Ezriel Hildesheimer) vol. 1, Jerusalem 1971, p. 492 (Aramaic); ''Ginzei Qedem'' (ed. Benjamin Menashe Levin), vol. 3, chapter 14 (''Hil. Tefillin of Rabbi Hai Gaon''), Haifa 1925, pp. 73–74 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Baladi-rite custom is to wear one's large ''[[talith]]'' on the night of the Sabbath, as well as on the night of any given [[Yom tov|Festival day]].

The '''[[Bishop]] of [[Northampton]]''' is the [[Ordinary (officer)|Ordinary]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Northampton]] in the [[Province of Westminster]], England.&lt;ref name=dnort&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|diocese|dnort|Diocese of Northampton|29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Episcopal see|see]] is in the town of [[Northampton]] where the [[Cathedra|bishop's seat]] is located in the [[Northampton Cathedral|Cathedral Church of Our Lady and Saint Thomas of Canterbury]].

The current bishop is the Right Reverend [[Peter John Haworth Doyle|Peter Doyle]], who was ordained bishop on 28 June 2005.

==History==
The [[Apostolic Vicariate]] of the Eastern District of England was created in 1840 out of the [[Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District|Midland District]] (which was renamed the Central District) and a couple of counties out of the [[Vicar Apostolic of the London District|London District]]. The Eastern District consisted of the counties of [[Cambridgeshire]] (with the [[Isle of Ely]]), [[Huntingdonshire]], [[Lincolnshire]], [[Norfolk]], [[Northamptonshire]], [[Rutland]], and [[Suffolk]], all from the former Midland District, and the counties of [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Buckinghamshire]] from the London District.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brady|1876}}, ''The Episcopal Succession, volume 3'', p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Universalis Ecclesiae|restoration of the Catholic hierarchy]] in [[England and Wales]] by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1850, most of the Eastern District became the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Northampton|Diocese of Northampton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brady|1876}}, ''The Episcopal Succession, volume 3'', p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; with the Vicar Apostolic the Eastern District, [[William Wareing]], appointed the first bishop of the diocese.&lt;ref name=bware/&gt; The remainder of the Eastern District (Lincolnshire and Rutland) became part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nottingham|Diocese of Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brady|1876}}, ''The Episcopal Succession, volume 3'', p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the [[Local Government Act 1972|Local Government Act of 1972]], a small area of Buckinghamshire became part of [[Berkshire]], and Huntingdonshire and the Isle of Ely merged into Cambridgeshire. The Diocese of Northampton lost territory (Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk) on the creation of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of East Anglia|Diocese of East Anglia]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=deaan&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|diocese|dnort|Diocese of East Anglia|29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bojjana Konda statue 06.jpg|thumb|View of the site]]
[[File:Holy relic sites map of Andhra Pradesh.jpg|thumb|260px|Bojjannakonda is one of the Holy relic sites of Andhra Pradesh]]
'''Bojjannakonda''' and '''Lingalakonda''' are two [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] rock-cut caves on adjacent hillocks, situated near a village called Sankaram, which is a few kilometres away from [[Anakapalle]], [[Vishakhapatnam]] in the [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. The sites are believed to date between 4th and 9th Century A.D, when the 3 phases of Buddhism ([[Hinayana]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]]) flourished at Sankaram (Sangharam as it was called then) .

==Brief History==
Sankaram, a small village, is situated about a mile to the east of Anakapalli in the Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh. A short distance to the north of the village are two hills, the one on the east called '''Bojjannakonda''' and the other on the west called '''Lingalakonda''', both of which are surrounded by paddy fields. The hills contain numerous monolithic stupas, rock-cut caves, chaityas and monasteries forming one of the most remarkable [[Buddhist]] establishments in Andhra Pradesh during the period from the 4th to the 9th Century CE. The name of the village Sankaram is evidently a corruption of Sangharam (Boudha-arama, i.e., [[vihara]]) as these Buddhist establishments are generally known.

==Features==

===Bojjannakonda===
This is the eastern hill. It is covered with a large group of monolithic stupas surrounding the rock-cut platforms of the Maha stupa
The dome of the stupa is found constructed of brick.

It was excavated under the aegis of Alexander Rim in 1906. Interesting aspect of this site is it feature all three phases of Buddhism i.e. Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana.

Groups of rock-cut and brick stupas and small chaityas surround this stupa. In two of the brick stupas, stone relic caskets in the form of miniature stupas were found. There is also a stone [Linga being the name locally applied to the stupa]. An image of the [[Goddess]] Hariti is found at the foot of the hill as per the archaeological sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://asihyd.ap.nic.in/vizag_monuments.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On this hill there are six rock-cut caves of which some have sculptured panels. One main cave has sixteen pillars, or which five are broken, and it enshrines a monolithic stupa in the centre. There is a pradakshina-patha around it. On the ceiling over the stupa is a carving of a chhatra, i.e., umbrella which was originally connected with the top of the stupa, the shaft being now lost. Above this cave, is an upper storey with the figures of Buddha. In all, on this hill [Bojjannakonda], there are six rock-cut caves of which some have sculptured panels. Most panels consists of a seated Buddha and attendants.

===Lingalakonda===
The western hill, known as '''Lingalakonda''', is covered with a large number of rock-cut small stupas forming the shape of a ridge. Numerous antiquities were recovered during the excavations conducted by Mr. Alexander Rea in 1907-08 on both the hills.

During Excavations&lt;ref&gt;http://asihyd.ap.nic.in/vizag_monuments.html&lt;/ref&gt; From this area, as per the archaeological sources, pottery, seals, terracotta inscribed tablets, terracotta beads, and terracotta figures, one gold coin belonging to [[Samudragupta|Samudra Gupta]] of the Gupta dynasty who ruled Magadha from 340 to 375 A.D, some copper coins belonging to the Eastern [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] king Vishnuvardhana surnamed Vishamasiddhi (633 A.D.) and only one lead coin were recovered. It has the impression of a horse and as such might belong to the later Satavahanas. It is on the evidence of these antiquities that it has been possible to date the Buddhist settlement here as lying between the 2nd and the 9th century A.D. For, among the earliest coins discovered at the site is that of [[Samudragupta|Samudra Gupta]] of the 4th century AD.

As Buddhism began to spread, many centres of learning and viharas for the monks were set up in various regions. 
They can also be seen at [[Thotlakonda]], [[Bavikonda]], [[Pavurallakonda]] around [[Visakhapatnam]]. 
They all flourished around 3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE, but then gradually faded out, probably due to the revival of [[Hinduism]].

Buddhist monks used to worship on the hill 2,000 years ago. It was originally known as '''Buddhuni konda''' (hill of the Buddha) but it came to be known as ‘Bojjannakonda' in course of time. Vaisakha Pournami is also celebrated on a large scale here at Bojjannakonda.

The Indian National Trust for Arts and Cultural Heritage, ([[INTACH]]), has already appealed to the authorities to ensure better protection of Buddhist sites by taking up the declaration of Bavikonda, Thotlakonda, Pavurallakonda and Bojjannakonda as heritage sites by UNESCO. This will not only pave the way for steady flow of funds, but also generate employment opportunities for the locals.

'''''Calcalist''''' ({{lang-he|כלכליסט}}, a Hebrew wordplay on ''[[The Economist]]'') is an Israeli daily business newspaper and website.

==History and profile==
''Calcalist'' was first published on 18 February 2008, and currently runs five days a week, with a weekend supplement included on Thursdays. The paper is published in [[Israel]] by the [[Yedioth Ahronoth Group]]. The group also publishes ''Yedioth Ahronoth'', the country's most widely circulated newspaper. The founder and publisher is [[Yoel Esteron]], formerly the managing editor for ''Yedioth Ahronoth'', and its editor is Galit Hemi. It is circulated nationwide and its articles feature regularly in the biggest Israeli news website 'Ynet' as well as in the printed edition of Yedioth Ahronoth.

The newspaper is divided into four sections: news, daily columns – some regular and some rotating (the rotating columns are marketing, legal, real estate, technology, career, personal finance, automotive and sports), the market – a separate addendum appearing Monday through Thursday, and "2016", the lifestyle section. Calcalist.co.il publishes most stories and articles from the newspaper, as well as news updates throughout the day and special digital features. According to SimilarWeb, which monitors websites, Calcalist.co.il has 2,800,000 unique users monthly, making it the most popular business website in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.calcalist.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3716325,00.html|title=

{{LGBT topics and Christianity}}
Within [[Christianity]], there are a variety of views on [[sexual orientation]] and [[homosexuality]]. The many [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] vary in their position, from condemning homosexual acts as [[Christian views on sin|sinful]], through being divided on the issue, to seeing it as morally acceptable. Even within a denomination, individuals and groups may hold different views. Further, not all members of a denomination necessarily support their church's views on homosexuality.

Historically, from the earliest days, Christians have taught that same-sex acts are contrary to Biblical teaching: [[Tertullian]] (155 – c. 240),&lt;ref&gt;3:96. Roberts, A. and Donaldson, J. eds. 1885-1896. ''Ante-Nicene Fathers'', 10 vols. Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyprian]] (c. 200 – 258),&lt;ref&gt;36:14-15. Deferrari, R. J., ed. 1947- . ''Fathers of the Church: A New Translation''. Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ambrosiaster]] (300s),&lt;ref&gt;81:51 in Vogels, Heinrich Joseph and Ambrosiaster. ''Ambrosiastri Qui Dicitur Commentarius In Epistulas Paulinas''. Vindobonae: Hoelder-Pichler-Tempsky, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Chrysostom]] (c. 349 – 407),&lt;ref&gt;1, 11:355-356. Wace, Henry and  Schaff, Philip. 1890-1900. ''A Select library of Nicene and post-Nicene fathers of the Christian church''. Second series. New York, The Christian Literature Company.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Severian of Gabala]] 1:27 (before 380 – before 425).&lt;ref&gt;15:214. Staab, K. ed. 1933. ''Pauluskommentare aus der griechischen Kirche: Aus Katenenhandschriften gesammelt und herausgegeben.'' NT Abhandlungen 15. Munster in Westfalen: Aschendorff.&lt;/ref&gt; The teachings of various church groups through the past centuries is surveyed in [[History of Christianity and homosexuality|an article on the history of Christianity and homosexuality]].

This article focuses on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, covering how the extent to which the Bible mentions the subject, whether or not it is condemned, and whether the various passages apply today, have become contentious topics. Debate has arisen over the proper interpretation of the Levitical code; the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]; and various Pauline passages, and whether these verses condemn same-sex sexual activities.

==Christian denominational positions==
{{Main article|List of Christian denominational positions on homosexuality}}

===Roman Catholic Church===
The [[Catholic Church]] views as sinful any sexual act not related to procreation by couple joined under the Sacrament of Matrimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a6.htm#2357 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, para. 2357 Catholic Church |publisher=Scborromeo.org |date=29 October 1951 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com/library/Birth_Control.asp |title=Birth Control &amp;#124; Catholic Answers |publisher=Catholic.com |accessdate=12 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213012353/http://www.catholic.com/library/Birth_Control.asp |archivedate=13 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church states that "homosexual tendencies" are "objectively disordered", but does not consider the tendency itself to be sinful but rather a temptation toward sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - IntraText|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Discernment&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccatheduc/documents/rc_con_ccatheduc_doc_20051104_istruzione_en.html Criteria for the Discernment of Vocation for Persons with Homosexual Tendencies, 2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225000000/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccatheduc/documents/rc_con_ccatheduc_doc_20051104_istruzione_en.html |date=25 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church, however, considers "homosexual acts" to be "grave sins", "intrinsically disordered", and "contrary to the natural law", and "under no circumstances can they be approved".&lt;ref name=Discernment/&gt;&lt;ref name="CCC2357"&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a6.htm#2357 Catechism of the Catholic Church, § 2357]; cf. Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2351, 2391, 2396&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018 German bishop [[Franz-Josef Bode]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Osnabrück]] said in an interview with German journalists that [[blessing of same-sex unions]] is possible in Roman Catholic churches in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/niedersachsen/Bischof-Bode-fuer-Segnung-von-Homo-Paaren,segnung100.html NDR.de: Bischof für Segnung von homosexuellen Paaren (German)], 10 January, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, German Roman Catholic cardinal [[Reinhard Marx]], chairman of the [[German Bishops' Conference]], said in an interview with German journalists that [[blessing of same-sex unions]] is possible in Roman Catholic churches in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.br.de/nachrichten/kardinal-marx-homosexuelle-100.html Bayrischer Rundfunk.de: "Segnung homosexueller Paare ist möglich"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/reinhard-marx-kardinal-stellt-segnung-homosexueller-paare-in-aussicht-a-1191270.html Spiegel.de: Kardinal Marx stellt Segnung homosexueller Paare in Aussicht]&lt;/ref&gt; In Austria blessing of same sex unions is allowed in two churches&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kirchenzeitung.at/newsdetail/rubrik/segen-fuer-verliebte-in-oberoesterreichs-pfarren/]&lt;/ref&gt; located in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Linz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=30651 Queer.de:Zum Valentinstag: Katholische Diözese segnet auch Homo-Paare](german)&lt;/ref&gt;

P. | title = The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium | location = New York | year = 1991 | pages = 945–946}}&lt;/ref&gt; like the Catholic Church, condemns only homosexual acts.

===Orthodox churches===
All [[Orthodox Church]] jurisdictions, such as the [[Orthodox Church in America]], have taken the approach of welcoming people with "homosexual feelings and emotions," while encouraging them to work towards "overcoming its harmful effects in their lives," and not allowing the [[sacraments]] to people who seek to justify homosexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oca.org/DOCmarriage.asp?SID=12&amp;ID=26 Orthodox Church in America] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709033038/http://www.oca.org/DOCmarriage.asp?SID=12&amp;ID=26 |date=9 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coptic.net/articles/OnHomosexuality.txt M. Mikhail, "The Coptic Orthodox Church's View on Homosexuality"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestant churches===

Certain other [[Christian denominations]] do not view monogamous same-sex relationships as sinful or immoral, and may [[Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches|bless such unions and consider them marriages]]. These include the [[United Church of Canada]], the [[United Church of Christ]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/05/national/05church.html NYTimes.com] "United Church of Christ Backs Same-Sex Marriage"&lt;/ref&gt; all German Lutheran, reformed and united churches in [[Evangelical Church in Germany|EKD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ekd.de/EKD-Texte/lebensgemeinschaft_2000.html |title=EKD:Verantwortung und Verlässlichkeit stärken (german) |publisher=Ekd.de |accessdate=12 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116093547/http://www.ekd.de/EKD-Texte/lebensgemeinschaft_2000.html |archivedate=16 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  all [[Swiss Reformed Church|Swiss reformed churches]], the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]], the [[United Protestant Church in Belgium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holebi.info/phpnews/kortnews.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=4179#|title=Verenigde Protestantse Kerk staat inzegening homohuwelijk toe.   - holebi.info|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Protestant Church of France]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.rfi.fr/france/20150517-french-protestant-church-authoriese-gay-marriages|title=French Protestant church authorises gay marriages|date=17 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Church of Denmark]], the [[Church of Sweden]], the [[Church of Iceland]],  the [[Church of Norway]], and the [[Uniting Church in Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sandeman |first=John |date=13 July 2018 |title=Uniting Church to hold same sex marriages |url=https://www.eternitynews.com.au/australia/uniting-church-to-hold-same-sex-marriage/ |work=Eternity |location=Australia |access-date=13 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lutheran]]&lt;ref name="LCMS – Homosexuality" /&gt; churches allow for the blessing of gay unions. The [[United Church of Canada]] also allows same-sex marriage, and views [[sexual orientation]] as a gift from God. Within the Anglican communion, there are openly gay clergy, for example, [[Gene Robinson]] is an openly gay Bishop in the US Episcopal Church. Within the Lutheran communion, there are openly gay clergy, too, for example, bishop [[Eva Brunne]] is an openly lesbian Bishop in the [[Church of Sweden]]. Such religious groups and denominations interpretation of scripture and doctrine leads them to accept that homosexuality is morally acceptable, and a natural occurrence. For example, in 1988 the [[United Church of Canada]], that country's largest Protestant denomination, affirmed that "a) All persons, regardless of their sexual orientation, who profess Jesus Christ and obedience to Him, are welcome to be or become full member of the Church''; and ''b) All members of the Church are eligible to be considered for the Ordered Ministry."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/chronology#1988 Chronology of Marriage and Equality Rights in the United Church] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425181001/http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/chronology#1988 |date=25 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Church's General Assembly further affirmed that "human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual or homosexual, are a gift from God and part of the marvelous diversity of creation."&lt;ref&gt;"Same-Sex Marriage Legislation Offers a Win-Win Solution, Says The United Church of Canada," 2005-FEB-01, United Church of Canada, at: http://www.united-church.ca/&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some Christian denominations such as the [[Moravian Church]], believe that the [[Bible]] speaks negatively of homosexual acts but, as research on the matter continues, the Moravian Church seeks to establish a policy on homosexuality and the ordination of homosexuals.&lt;ref name="The Moravian Interprovincial Faith &amp; Order Commission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moravianseminary.edu/FaithOrder/STHomosexuality1st.html |title=On Homosexuality and Ordination |publisher=The Moravian Interprovincial Faith &amp; Order Commission |accessdate=22 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060722092332/http://www.moravianseminary.edu/FaithOrder/STHomosexuality1st.html |archivedate=22 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Moravian Church in Europe allowed [[Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches|blessings of same-sex unions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idea.de/frei-kirchen/detail/brueder-unitaet-kuenftig-sind-homo-segnungen-moeglich-28126.html|title=Brüder-Unität: Künftig sind Homo-Segnungen möglich|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal Quakers, those in membership of [[Britain Yearly Meeting]] and [[Friends General Conference]] in the US approve of same-sex marriage and union.

====Various positions====
Churches within [[Lutheranism]] hold stances on the issue ranging from labeling homosexual acts as sinful, to acceptance of homosexual relationships. For example, the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]], the [[Lutheran Church of Australia]], and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] recognize homosexual behavior as intrinsically sinful and seek to minister to those who are struggling with homosexual inclinations.&lt;ref name="LCMS – Homosexuality"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://lcms.org/Documents.fdoc?src=lcm&amp;id=1100| title = What about Homosexuality?|publisher = [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]]|accessdate = 26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WELS – Homosexuality"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wels.net/what-we-believe/questions-answers/social-issues/acceptance-homosexuals |work= WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title= Acceptance of homosexuals |publisher= [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |date=27 Oct 2009 |accessdate = 27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Church of Sweden]] conducts [[same-sex marriage]]s, while the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] opens the ministry of the church to gay pastors and other professional workers living in committed relationships.&lt;ref name="ELCA – Sodomy"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Communication-Services/News/Releases.aspx?a=4253 |title= ELCA Assembly Opens Ministry to Partnered Gay and Lesbian Lutherans |publisher= [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] |accessdate= 22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopian [[Mekane Yesus]] Lutheran Church, however, has taken a stand that marriage is inherently between a man and a woman, and has formally broken fellowship with the ELCA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eecmy.org/?home=po&amp;page=!news&amp;newscategory=/&amp;article=62|title=Home|first=Super|last=User|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a doctrinal stand that has cost the Ethiopian church ELCA financial support.

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] "recognizes that every human being is valuable in the sight of God, and seeks to minister to all men and women [including homosexuals] in the spirit of Jesus," while maintaining that homosexual sex itself is forbidden in the Bible.  "Jesus affirmed the dignity of all human beings and reached out compassionately to persons and families suffering the consequences of sin. He offered caring ministry and words of solace to struggling people, while differentiating His love for sinners from His clear teaching about sinful practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adventist.org/information/official-statements/statements/article/go/0/homosexuality/|title=Official Statements - Homosexuality |accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the [[Anglican Communion]] does not approve of homosexual activity, with the exception of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-40036225 BBC:Kirk's General Assembly moves towards allowing gay marriage], 25 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]], which is facing a possible exclusion from international Anglican bodies over the issue.&lt;ref name="Times Online – Anglican Communion &amp; Homosexuality"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article680066.ece| title = ELCA Assembly Opens Ministry to Partnered Gay and Lesbian Lutherans|work=The Times |location=London |accessdate = 22 November 2009  | first=Ruth | last=Gledhill | date=27 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative Quakers, those within [[Friends United Meeting]] and the [[Evangelical Friends International]] believe that sexual relations are condoned only in marriage, which they define to be between a man and a woman.&lt;ref name="FUM – Homosexuality"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neym.org/FUMworkweb/history.pdf |title=History of FUM policy regarding the appointment of homosexuals |publisher=[[Friends United Meeting]] |accessdate=22 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008224923/http://neym.org/FUMworkweb/history.pdf |archivedate= 8 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evangelical churches===
The positions of the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical churches]] are varied. They range from [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] to [[Christian fundamentalism |conservative]], through [[moderate]]. &lt;ref&gt; Jeffrey S. Siker, ''Homosexuality and Religion: An Encyclopedia'', Greenwood Publishing Group, USA, 2007, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt; William Henard, Adam Greenway, ''Evangelicals Engaging Emergent'', B&amp;H Publishing Group, USA, 2009, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Conservative position ====
Some evangelical churches in the [[United States]]  have anti-gay activists who consider that homosexuality is at the root of many social problems. &lt;ref&gt; David Rayside, ''Faith, Politics, and Sexual Diversity in Canada and the United States'', UBC Press, Canada, 2011, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Some evangelical churches in [[Uganda]]  strongly oppose homosexuality and homosexuals. They have campaigned for laws criminalizing homosexuality. &lt;ref&gt; Ezra Chitando, Adriaan van Klinken, ''Christianity and Controversies Over Homosexuality in Contemporary Africa'', Routledge, UK, 2016, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Gay sex scandals =====
Some evangelical pastors with antigay speeches have been outed.

Ted Haggard is the founder of [[megachurch]] [[Charismatic Christianity]] [[New Life Church (Colorado Springs, Colorado) | New Life Church]] in [[Colorado Springs]], USA. Married with five children, Ted was an anti-gay activist and said he wanted to ban homosexuality from the church. In 2006, he was dismissed from his position as senior pastor after a prostitute claimed to have had sex with him for 3 years.&lt;ref&gt; ERIC GORSKI, FELISA CARDONA, MANNY GONZALES, [http://www.denverpost.com/2006/11/01/pastor-takes-leave-amid-allegations-of-gay-sex/ Pastor takes leave amid allegations of gay sex], denverpost.com, USA, November 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; After denying the relationship, the pastor admitted that the allegations were accurate.

George Alan Rekers is a Baptist pastor of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] in the US and a psychologist. He was an anti-gay activist. In 2010, he was outed by his openly gay male escort. Rekers claimed to be attempting to convert the young men to Christianity and said that he hired him to carry his luggage.&lt;ref&gt; PENN BULLOCK, BRANDON K. THORP, [http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/george-rekers-is-a-homosexual-escort-says-6528887 George Rekers Is a Homosexual, Escort Says], miaminewtimes.com, USA, May 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Liberal position====
===== International =====
There are some international evangelical denominations that are [[gay-friendly]], such as the [[Alliance of Baptists]] and [[Affirming Pentecostal Church International]].&lt;ref&gt; William H. Brackney, ''Historical Dictionary of the Baptists'', Editions Scarecrow Press, Canada, 2009, p. 520&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Adrian Thatcher, ''The Oxford Handbook of Theology, Sexuality, and Gender'', Oxford University Press, UK, 2015, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

===== U.S. =====
A 2014 survey reported that 43% of white evangelical American Christians between the ages of 18 and 33 supported same-sex marriage. &lt;ref&gt; Carol Kuruvilla, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/29/evangelical-christians-support-marriage-equality_n_7690408.html Meet The Evangelicals Who Cheered The SCOTUS Gay Marriage Ruling], huffingtonpost.com, USA, June 29, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Some evangelical churches accept homosexuality and celebrate gay weddings. &lt;ref &gt; TOM GJELTEN, MARISA PEÑALOZA, [https://www.npr.org/2016/05/10/476651599/acceptance-grows-slowly-but-steadily-for-gay-evangelicals Acceptance Grows, Slowly But Steadily, For Gay Evangelicals], npr.org, USA, May 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; AP, [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/34493087/ns/us_news-faith/t/evangelical-church-opens-doors-fully-gays/#.WKkcClXhB0w Evangelical church opens doors fully to gays], nbcnews.com, USA, December 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Pastors have also been involved in changing the traditional position of their church. In 2014, the New Heart Community Church of [[La Mirada]], a Baptist Church in the suburbs of [[Los Angeles]] was expelled from the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] for this purpose. &lt;ref&gt; Heidi Hall, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/03/evangelical-churches-lgbt_n_6795764.html Evangelical Churches Grapple With LGBT Inclusion], huffingtonpost.com, USA, March 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, GracePointe Church in [[Franklin, Tennessee| Franklin]] in the suburbs of [[Nashville]] made this decision. &lt;ref&gt; Jill Cowan, [http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/religion/2015/01/30/gracepointe-church-franklin-will-support-gay-marriage/22588889/ GracePointe Church in Franklin will support gay marriage], tennessean.com, USA, January 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; It lost over half of her weekly attendance (from 1,000 to 482). &lt;ref&gt; Elizabeth Dias, [http://time.com/3687368/gracepointe-church-nashville-marriage-equality/ Nashville Evangelical Church Comes Out for Marriage Equality], time.com, USA, January 29, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Moderate position====
Some churches have a moderate position. Although they do not approve homosexual practices, they show sympathy and respect for homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hunt, ''Contemporary Christianity and LGBT Sexualities'', Routledge, UK, 2016, p. 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;

===== U.S. =====
Reflecting this position, some pastors, for example, showed moderation during public statements.  For example, Pastor [[Joel Osteen]] of [[Lakewood Church]] in [[Houston]] said in 2013 he found it unfortunate that several Christian ministers focus on the homosexuality by forgetting the other sins described in the Bible. He said that Jesus did not come to condemn people, but to save them.&lt;ref&gt; Nicola Menzie, [https://www.christianpost.com/news/joel-osteen-talks-preaching-sin-materialism-and-coming-out-in-support-of-gay-marriage-111212/ Joel Osteen Talks Preaching Sin, Materialism, and Gay Marriage], christianpost.com, USA, December 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Other pastors also share this view. &lt;ref&gt; Micah J. Murray, [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/micah-j-murray/what-the-christian-right-_b_4706280.html What the Christian Right Gets Wrong About Sin], huffingtonpost.com, USA, April 2, 2014 &lt;/ref&gt;

Pastor [[Carl Lentz]] of [[Hillsong Church]] [[New York City]] said in 2014 that [[gays]] were numerous in their church and he prayed that Hillsong always welcoming.&lt;ref&gt;Cath Martin, christiantoday, [http://www.christiantoday.com/article/hillsong.new.york.pastor.carl.lentz.we.have.a.lot.of.gay.men.and.women.in.our.church.and.i.pray.we.always.do/37918.htm Hillsong New York pastor Carl Lentz: 'We have a lot of gay men and women in our church and I pray we always do'], USA, June 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Blumberg, huffingtonpost.com, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/17/hillsong-church-gays_n_6002762.html Hillsong Church Pastors Won't Speak Out On Gays Because Jesus Didn't Either], USA, October 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastor [[Andy Stanley]] of [[North Point Community Church]] in [[Alpharetta, Georgia|Alpharetta]], mentioned in 2015 that the church should be the safest place on the planet for students to talk about anything, including same-sex attraction.&lt;ref&gt;MICHAEL GRYBOSKI, christianpost.com, [http://www.christianpost.com/news/andy-stanley-churches-should-be-safest-place-on-the-planet-for-gay-youth-137739/ Andy Stanley: Churches Should Be 'Safest Place on the Planet' for Gay Youth], USA, April 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a movement of people who consider themselves "gay Evangelicals". &lt;ref&gt;Molly Worthen, nytimes.com, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/opinion/sunday/who-are-the-gay-evangelicals.html Who Are the Gay Evangelicals?], USA, February 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Composed mainly of young people, the movement is positioned against liberals and conservatives. Recognizing themselves as gay or bisexual, these young people believe that their attraction to same-sex people, while present, does not allow them to have homosexual relationships. They say that their Christian conversion did not instantly change their sexual desires. They insist that the church should always reject homosexual practices, but that it should welcome gay people.

There are also believers gathered in Christian organizations of evangelical orientation, such as ''Your Other Brothers'' or ''Voice of the Voiceless'', who claim they have not been attracted to homosexuality since their [[new birth]], without having recourse to a [[conversion therapy]]. &lt;ref&gt; Brandon Showalter, [https://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-men-struggling-with-homosexuality-find-refuge-in-your-other-brothers-storytelling-project-170964/ Christian Men Struggling With Homosexuality Find Refuge in 'Your Other Brothers' Storytelling Project], christianpost.com, USA, October 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Chandelis R.

===== France =====
The French Evangelical Alliance, a member of the European Evangelical Alliance and the [[World Evangelical Alliance]], adopted on 12 October 2002, through its National Council, a document entitled ''Foi, espérance et homosexualité'' ("Faith, Hope and Homosexuality "), in which homophobia, hatred and rejection of homosexuals are condemned, but which denies homosexual practices and full church membership of unrepentant homosexuals and those who approve of these practices.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Lesegretain, ''Les chrétiens et l'homosexualité : l'enquête'', Bouquineo, France, 2011, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Conseil national des évangéliques de France (French National Council of Evangelicals) reaffirmed its position on the issue by opposing marriage of same-sex couples, while not rejecting homosexuals, but wanting to offer them more than a blessing; an accompaniment and a welcome. &lt;ref&gt;Loup Besmond de Senneville, la-croix.com, [http://www.la-croix.com/Religion/Actualite/Benediction-de-couples-homosexuels-critiques-vives-des-protestants-evangeliques-2015-05-18-1313309 Bénédiction de couples homosexuels : critiques vives des protestants évangéliques], France, May 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The French evangelical pastor Philippe Auzenet, a chaplain of the association Oser en parler, regularly intervenes on the subject in the media. It promotes dialogue and respect, as well as sensitization in order to better understand homosexuals. &lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Ciarapica, aleloo.com, [http://www.aleloo.com/journal/index.php/2006/04/30/134-parler-de-l-homosexualite-interview-de-philippe-auzenet Parler de l'homosexualité, interview de Philippe Auzenet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116173746/http://www.aleloo.com/journal/index.php/2006/04/30/134-parler-de-l-homosexualite-interview-de-philippe-auzenet |date=16 January 2017 }}, France, 30 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He also said in 2012 that Jesus would go to a gay bar, because he was going to all people with love.&lt;ref&gt;La Dépêche de Tahiti, [http://consultation.ladepeche.pf/article/societe/%E2%80%9Cjesus-irait-dans-un-bar-gay%E2%80%9D "JÉSUS IRAIT DANS UN BAR GAY"], France, December 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Nigeria =====
Philip Igbinijesu, a pastor of the [[Lagos]] Word Assembly, an [[Evangelical church]], said in a message to his church that the Nigerian law on homosexuality (inciting denunciation) was hateful. He recalled that homosexuals are creatures of God and that they should be treated with respect.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie BOUILLON, liberation.fr, [http://www.liberation.fr/monde/2014/04/11/nigeria-dieu-vous-enverra-un-texto-pour-vous-remercier_995593 Nigeria "Dieu vous enverra un texto pour vous remercier"], France, April 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restorationist churches===
[[Restorationist]] churches, like [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Seventh-Day Adventist]], and the mainline Mormon Church ([[Latter Day Saint movement|LDS]]) generally teach that homosexuals are 'broken' and can be 'fixed'. The LDS church known as the [[Community of Christ]] fully accepts LGBT persons, performs weddings for gay and lesbian couples, and ordains LGBT members. Within the Stone-Campbell aligned restorationist churches the views are divergent. The [[churches of Christ]] (A Capella) and the [[Independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ]] mostly adhere to a very conservative ideology; socially, politically, and religiously and are generally not accepting of openly LGBT members and will not perform weddings for gay and lesbian couples. The [[Disciples of Christ]], is fully accepting of LGBT persons, often performs weddings for gay and lesbian couples, and ordains LGBT members. The [[United Church of Christ]] is an officially "open and affirming" church. Other Restorationist churches such as The [[Brethren]] (see [[Mennonite]]) and [[Millerite]] churches, have taken mixed positions but are increasingly accepting with some of their congregations fully accepting LGBT persons in all aspects of religious and political life.

Christian objections to homosexual behavior are based upon their interpretations of the Bible. Some Christians interpret the book of [[Leviticus]] as prohibiting homosexual sex.&lt;ref name="leaderu.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leaderu.com/jhs/dallas.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021105000252/http%3A//www.leaderu.com/jhs/dallas.html |archivedate=5 November 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizenlink.org/FOSI/homosexuality/theology/A000008030.cfm |title=a Focus on the Family Affiliate |publisher=CitizenLink.com |date=8 November 2011 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2020:13;&amp;version=31; |title=Leviticus 20:13; NIV; – If a man has sexual relations with a |publisher=Bible Gateway |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2018:22;&amp;version=31; |title=Leviticus 18:22; NIV; – Do not have sexual relations with a man |publisher=Bible Gateway |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Biblical scholars interpret {{bibleverse||Genesis|19:5|KJV}} as indicating that homosexual activity led to the destruction of the ancient cities of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]].&lt;ref name="leaderu.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Christian author and counselor [[Joe Dallas]] says that the Biblical passages relating to homosexual acts uniformly prohibit that behavior.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joedallas.com/resources/Relevance%20&amp;R.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Christian organisations such as the former 'ex-gay' group [[Exodus International]] take the view that {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:9–11|KJV}} offers Christian believers "freedom from homosexuality,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://exodus.to/content/view/313/87/ ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901081023/http://exodus.to/content/view/313/87/ |date=1 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freeministry.org/h/articles/art1.htm|title=When Someone You Love Is Gay|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Exodus ceased activities in June 2013, issuing a statement which repudiated some of its aims and apologized for the harm their pursuit has caused to [[LGBT]] people.&lt;ref name=Change&gt;{{cite web|title=I am sorry |url=http://exodusinternational.org/2013/06/i-am-sorry |accessdate=20 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623013409/http://exodusinternational.org/2013/06/i-am-sorry |archivedate=23 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholicism===
The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states "men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies ... must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm "Catechism of the Catholic Church"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304000000/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm |date=4 March 2009 }}, see the "Chastity and homosexuality" section.&lt;/ref&gt; "Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided." They oppose criminal penalties against homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/2008/documents/rc_seg-st_20081218_statement-sexual-orientation_en.html |title=STATEMENT OF THE HOLY SEE DELEGATION AT THE 63rd SESSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS ON THE DECLARATION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY (18 DECEMBER 2008) |publisher=Vatican.va |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Catholic Church requires those who are attracted to people of the same (or opposite) sex to practice [[chastity]], because it teaches that sexuality should only be practiced within marriage, which includes chaste sex as permanent, [[procreation|procreative]], heterosexual, and monogamous. The [[Holy See|Vatican]] distinguishes between "deep-seated homosexual tendencies" and the "expression of a transitory problem", in relation to ordination to the [[priesthood]]; saying in a [[Instruction Concerning the Criteria for the Discernment of Vocations with regard to Persons with Homosexual Tendencies in view of their Admission to the Seminary and to Holy Orders|2005 document]] that homosexual tendencies "must be clearly overcome at least three years before ordination to the diaconate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccatheduc/documents/rc_con_ccatheduc_doc_20051104_istruzione_en.html Instruction Concerning the Criteria for the Discernment of Vocations with regard to Persons with Homosexual Tendencies in view of their Admission to the Seminary and to Holy Orders] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225000000/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccatheduc/documents/rc_con_ccatheduc_doc_20051104_istruzione_en.html |date=25 February 2008 }}, Congregation for Catholic Education, 4 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 report based on telephone surveys of American Catholics conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 56% believe that sexual relations between two people of the same sex are not sinful.&lt;ref name="USAtoday"&gt;{{Cite news |work=USA Today |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/Religion/post/2011/03/gay-marriage-catholic-church-/1 |title=U.S. Catholics break with church on gay relationships |date=23 March 2011 |first=Cathy Lynn |last=Grossman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Public Religion Research Institute |url=http://www.publicreligion.org/research/?id=509 |title=Catholic Attitudes on Gay and Lesbian Issues: A Comprehensive Portrait from Recent Research |date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confessional Lutheranism===
[[Confessional Lutheran]] churches teach that it is sinful to have homosexual desires, even if they do not lead to homosexual activity.&lt;ref name="WELSQA-871"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?process&amp;procID=1518&amp;cuQA_qaID=1&amp;cuTopic_topicID=28&amp;cuItem_itemID=871 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090928041714/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?process&amp;procID=1518&amp;cuQA_qaID=1&amp;cuTopic_topicID=28&amp;cuItem_itemID=871 |archivedate=28 September 2009 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title= Human Behavior - Sexual Behavior |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |accessdate=24 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Doctrinal statement issued by the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] states that making a distinction between homosexual orientation and the act of homosexuality is confusing:
{{quote|"''We cannot limit the sin of homosexuality to deeds but not desires, any more than we can limit heterosexual sin to deeds but not desires. Scripture clearly includes desires and inclinations toward sinful actions in the category of sin (Mt 5:27-28). This is true of both homosexual and heterosexual sin.''"&lt;ref name=welsstatement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wlsessays.net/files/BrugIsHomosexualityASin.pdf |title=Doctrinal Brief: Is Homosexuality a Sin? |last=Brug |first=John F. |publisher=[[Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary]] |page=288 |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522213615/http://wlsessays.net/files/BrugIsHomosexualityASin.pdf |archivedate=22 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
However, confessional Lutherans also warn against [[Hypocrisy|selective morality]] which harshly condemns homosexuality while treating other sins more lightly.&lt;ref name=welsstatement/&gt;

===Other Christians===
In opposing interpretations of the Bible that are supportive of homosexual relationships, conservative Christians have argued for the reliability of the Bible,&lt;ref&gt;The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration, by Bruce M. Metzger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWDSR8y911kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inerrancy+of+the+bible |title=Inerrancy By Norman L.

Gudel |publisher=Iclnet.org |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative to a school-sponsored [[Day of Silence]] opposing bullying of LGBT students, conservative Christians organized a Golden Rule Initiative, where they passed out cards saying "As a follower of Christ, I believe that all people are created in the image of God and therefore deserve love and respect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On August 29, 2017, the [[Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood]] released a manifesto on human sexuality known as the "Nashville Statement". The statement was signed by 150 evangelical leaders, and includes 14 points of belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Meyer |first=Holly |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/08/29/evangelical-manifesto-human-sexuality/614201001/ |title=More than 150 evangelical religious leaders sign 'Christian manifesto' on human sexuality |date=August 29, 2017 |work=USA Today |accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, theologians like [[Jürgen Moltmann]], [[Hans Küng]], [[John A. T. Robinson|John Robinson]], [[David Edward Jenkins|Bishop David Jenkins]], [[Don Cupitt]], and [[John Shelby Spong|Bishop Jack Spong]]  challenged traditional theological positions and understandings of the Bible; following these developments some have suggested that passages have been mistranslated or that they do not refer to what we understand as "homosexuality."&lt;ref&gt;See generally http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bibl.htm and subpages therein.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clay Witt, a minister in the [[Metropolitan Community Church]], explains how theologians and commentators like [[John Shelby Spong]], George Edwards and Michael England interpret injunctions against certain sexual acts as being originally intended as a means of distinguishing religious worship between Abrahamic and the surrounding [[Paganism|pagan]] faiths, within which homosexual acts featured as part of idolatrous religious practices: "England argues that these prohibitions should be seen as being directed against sexual practices of fertility cult worship. As with the earlier reference from Strong’s, he notes that the word 'abomination' used here is directly related to idolatry and idolatrous practices throughout the Hebrew Testament. Edwards makes a similar suggestion, observing that 'the context of the two prohibitions in  {{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:22|KJV|}} and {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV|}} suggest that what is opposed is not same-sex activity outside the cult, as in the modern secular sense, but within the cult identified as Canaanite'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrmcc.org/Resources/StudyDocuments/bibleand.htm |title=Homosexuality and the Bible, Rev.

In 1986 the [[Evangelical and Ecumenical Women’s Caucus]] (EEWC), then known as the Evangelical Women's Caucus International, passed a resolution stating: "Whereas homosexual people are children of God, and because of the biblical mandate of Jesus Christ that we are all created equal in God's sight, and in recognition of the presence of the lesbian minority in EWCI, EWCI takes a firm stand in favor of civil rights protection for homosexual persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoJrHDirVQUC&amp;pg=PA471&amp;lpg=PA471&amp;dq=%22whereas%20homosexual%20people%20are%20children%20of%20god%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zW5ZeaAyiJ&amp;sig=YvLXGt_t71EurjQE-XvZItlG0is&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aVlhUt27OIWt4AOW_oGACg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22whereas%20homosexual%20people%20are%20children%20of%20god%22&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America: Women and religion: methods of study and reflection|first1=Rosemary Skinner|last1=Keller|first2=Rosemary Radford|last2=Ruether|first3=Marie|last3=Cantlon|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Indiana University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians believe that Biblical passages have been mistranslated or that these passages do not refer to LGBT orientation as currently understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sisterfriends-together.org/the-bible-and-homosexuality/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228050848/http://www.sisterfriends-together.org/the-bible-and-homosexuality/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 February 2008 |title=The Bible and Homosexuality |accessdate=4 July 2008 |work=SisterFriends Together |publisher=Grace Unfolding Ministries }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Liberal Christian scholars, like conservative Christian scholars, accept earlier versions of the texts that make up the Bible in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Greek language|Greek]]. However, within these early texts there are many terms that modern scholars have interpreted differently from previous generations of scholars.&lt;ref name = SLAVERY/&gt;&lt;ref name = WOMEN/&gt;&lt;ref name = ROGERS/&gt; There are concerns with copying errors, forgery, and biases among the translators of later Bibles.&lt;ref name = SLAVERY/&gt;&lt;ref name = WOMEN/&gt;&lt;ref name = ROGERS/&gt; They consider some verses such as those they say support [[slavery]]&lt;ref name = SLAVERY&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/sla_bibl.htm |title=What the Bible says about slavery |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the inferior treatment of women&lt;ref name = WOMEN&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/ofe_bibl.htm ReligiousTolerance.org].&lt;/ref&gt; as not being valid today, and against the will of God present in the context of the Bible. They cite these issues when arguing for a change in theological views on sexual relationships to what they say is an earlier view. They differentiate among various sexual practices, treating rape, prostitution, or temple sex rituals as immoral and those within committed relationships as positive regardless of [[sexual orientation]]. They view certain verses, which they believe refer only to homosexual rape, as not relevant to consensual homosexual relationships.&lt;ref name = ROGERS&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ksWrErBqRVUC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=homosexual+rape+sodom+and+gomorrah&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9cHm0_jzYf&amp;sig=hhQ7rpPMveL-dK0XJMS9NLjmPBg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=icdXSr6aPJuZjAf94cTNDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4 |title=Jesus, the Bible, and homosexuality; by Jack Rogers |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yale professor [[John Boswell]] has argued that a number of [[Early Christians]] entered into homosexual relationships,&lt;ref name=BOS&gt;{{Citation | last= Boswell | first= John | title= The Marriage of Likeness. Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe | publisher= Fontana | year= 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that certain Biblical figures had homosexual relationships, such as [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] and her mother-in-law [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and the court official Ashpenaz, and [[David and Jonathan|David]] and King [[Saul]]'s son [[David and Jonathan|Jonathan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bmar.htm |title=ReligiousTolerance.org |publisher=ReligiousTolerance.org |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boswell has also argued that [[adelphopoiesis]], a rite bonding two men, was akin to a religiously sanctioned same-sex union. Having partaken in such a rite, a person was prohibited from entering into marriage or taking monastic vows, and the choreography of the service itself closely parallelled that of the marriage rite.&lt;ref name=BOS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robin Darling Young, "[http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9411/articles/darling.html Gay Marriage: Reimagining Church History]", [[First Things]] 47 (November 1994), pp. 43–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Halsall"&gt;Paul Halsall, ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/bosrevdisc-kennedy1.html Reviewing Boswell]'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; His views have not found wide acceptance, and opponents have argued that this rite sanctified a [[Platonic love|Platonic]] brotherly bond, not a homosexual union.&lt;ref name="Halsall"/&gt; He also argued that condemnation of homosexuality began only in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Boswell2"&gt;John Boswell, ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/1979boswell.html The Church and the Homosexual – An Historical Perspective]'' (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Boswell's critics&lt;ref&gt;Gagnon R.A.J., ''The Bible and Homosexual Practice: Texts and Hermeneutics''. Nashville, TN: Abingdon, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; point out that many earlier doctrinal sources condemn homosexuality as a sin even if they do not prescribe a specific punishment, and that Boswell's arguments are based on sources which reflected a general trend towards harsher penalties, rather than a change in doctrine, from the 12th century onwards.

[[Desmond Tutu]], the former [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa|Anglican]] Archbishop of Cape Town and a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has described homophobia as a "crime against humanity" and "every bit as unjust" as apartheid:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/13584 |title=Desmond Tutu: "Homophobia equals apartheid" |publisher=Afrol.com |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We struggled against apartheid in South Africa, supported by people the world over, because black people were being blamed and made to suffer for something we could do nothing about; our very skins. It is the same with sexual orientation. It is a given. ... We treat them [gays and lesbians] as pariahs and push them outside our communities. We make them doubt that they too are children of God – and this must be nearly the ultimate blasphemy. We blame them for what they are."&lt;ref&gt;Sex, Love &amp; Homophobia, published by Amnesty International UK, 2005, foreword by Desmund Tutu.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern gay Christian leader [[Justin R. Cannon]] promotes what he calls "Inclusive Orthodoxy" (not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox Church). He explains on his ministry website: "Inclusive Orthodoxy is the belief that the Church can and must be inclusive of LGBT individuals without sacrificing the Gospel and the Apostolic teachings of the Christian faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truthsetsfree.net/about.htm |title=INCLUSIVE ORTHODOXY: Gay Christian Ministry – Bible and Homosexuality? |publisher=Truthsetsfree.net |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cannon's ministry takes a unique and distinct approach from modern liberal Christians while still supporting homosexual relations. His ministry affirms the divine inspiration of the Bible, the authority of Tradition, and says "...that there is a place within the full life and ministry of the Christian Church for lesbian, gay, [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] Christians, both those who are called to lifelong celibacy and those who are partnered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truthsetsfree.net/index.html |title=Inclusive Orthodoxy ~ The Rev.

Today, many religious people are becoming more affirming of same-sex relationships, even in denominations with official stances against homosexuality.

[[File:TroyPerry2006-09-17.JPG|thumb|right|Rev. [[Troy Perry]] preaching in 2006 at a [[Metropolitan Community Church]].]]
[[George Barna]], a conservative Christian author and researcher, conducted a survey in the United States in 2009 that found gay and lesbian people having a Christian affiliation were more numerous than had been presumed. He characterized some of his leading conclusions from the data as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Chellew-Hodge, Candace. "[http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/1590/new_poll_shows_gays_and_lesbians_believe_in_god New Poll Shows Gays and Lesbians Believe in God]." ''ReligionDispatches''. 25 June [[2009 in literature|2009]]. . Retrieved 2009-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"People who portray gay adults as [[Godlessness|godless]], [[hedonistic]], Christian bashers are not working with the facts. A substantial majority of gays cite their [[faith]] as a central facet of their life, consider themselves to be Christian, and claim to have some type of meaningful personal commitment to [[Jesus Christ]] active in their life today. The data indicate that millions of gay people are interested in faith but not in the local church and do not appear to be focused on the traditional tools and traditions that represent the comfort zone of most churched Christians. Gay adults clearly have a different way of interpreting the Bible on a number of central theological matters, such as perspectives about God. Homosexuals appreciate their faith but they do not prioritize it, and they tend to consider faith to be individual and private rather than communal."&lt;/blockquote&gt;  The study of 20 faith-oriented attributes revealed significant differences between the United States heterosexual and homosexual populations sampled, homosexual respondents being less likely to be ''born again Christians'' than heterosexual respondents (27% compared to 47%), and the degree of commitment to their faith and families also differed. Other significant contrasts were seen in regards to "liberal" versus "conservative" social positions, as well as in one’s understanding of God, with 43% of homosexual participants sharing the "orthodox, biblical" understanding of God which 71% of heterosexual participants indicate they do. Respondents were not asked to describe themselves as  "[[born again Christian|born again]]", but as is standard in Barna studies, this classification was defined according to basic standard criteria.&lt;ref name = BARNAGAY/&gt; Barna concluded, "The data indicates that millions of gay people are interested in faith but not in the local church and do not appear to be focused on the traditional tools and traditions that represent the comfort zone of most churched Christians." And that "Gay adults clearly have a different way of interpreting the Bible on a number of central theological matters, such as perspectives about God."&lt;ref name=BARNAGAY&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/13-culture/282-spiritual-profile-of-homosexual-adults-provides-surprising-insights |title=Spiritual Profile of Homosexual Adults Provides Surprising Insights |publisher=Barna.org |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=12 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106041153/http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/13-culture/282-spiritual-profile-of-homosexual-adults-provides-surprising-insights |archivedate= 6 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candace Chellew-Hodge, liberal Christian lesbian founder of online magazine ''Whosoever'', responded to the findings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All in all, I'm grateful for Barna even wandering into the subject of gay and lesbian [[religion|religious belief]]. I think his study is important and can go a long way to dispelling the old "gays vs. God" [[dichotomy]] that too often gets played out in the media. However, his overall message is still harmful: Gays and lesbians are Christians – they're just not as good as straight ones.&lt;ref name="Chellew-Hodge 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/1590/new_poll_shows_gays_and_lesbians_believe_in_god |title=New Poll Shows Gays and Lesbians Believe in God, Candace Chellew-Hodge, ReligionDispatches, 25 June 2009 (accessed 2009-06-27) |publisher=Religiondispatches.org |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She argued that Barna had formulated his report with undue irony and skepticism, and that he had failed to take into account the reasons for the data which enkindled his "arrière pensée."  The reason why far fewer homosexuals attend church, she argued, is that there are far fewer churches who will accept them. Equally, gays and lesbians do not see the Bible as unequivocally true because they are forced by its use against them to read it more closely and with less credulity, leading them to note its myriad [[internal consistency of the Bible|contradictions]].&lt;ref name="Chellew-Hodge 2009"/&gt;

Organizations for homosexual Christians exist across a wide range of beliefs and traditions. The interdenominational [[Gay Christian Network]] has some members who affirm same-sex relationships and others who commit themselves to celibacy, groups it refers to as "[[Gay Christian Network#Sex and Christianity|Side A]]" and "[[Gay Christian Network#Sex and Christianity|Side B]]", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaychristian.net/index.php? GCN Homepage] (website). Gay Christian Network. Retrieved 2008-03-05.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = The Believers| first = Tim| last = Murphy| newspaper = The Advocate| date = 17 June 2008| pages = 52–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to founder [[Justin Lee (activist)|Justin Lee]], &lt;blockquote&gt;"We're just trying to get people together who experience attraction to the same sex, however they have handled that, and who love Jesus and say, OK, you are welcome here, and then let's pray together and figure out where God wants us to take it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0612/18/acd.02.html Transcript] of 18 December 2006 episode of ''Anderson Cooper 360''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some organizations cater exclusively to homosexual Christians who do not want to have gay sex, or attraction; the goals of these organizations vary. Some Christian groups focus on simply refraining from gay sex, such as [[Courage International]] and [[North Star (organization)|North Star]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://northstarlds.org |title=North Star web site |publisher=Northstarlds.org |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other groups additionally encourage gay members to reduce or eliminate [[same-sex attraction]]s.  [[Love Won Out]] and the now-defunct [[Exodus International]] are examples of such ministries. These groups are sometimes referred to as [[ex-gay]] organizations, though many no longer use the term.  [[Alan Chambers (Exodus International)|Alan Chambers]], the president of Exodus, says the term incorrectly implies a complete change in sexual orientation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/18/nation/na-exgay18 |title=Approaching agreement in debate over homosexuality |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=18 June 2007 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the group [[Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays and Gays]] continues to use the term.  In addition, individual Christians identifying as gay who want to subscribe to the conservative ethic are becoming more vocal themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spiritual Friendship in 300 Words|url=http://spiritualfriendship.org/2012/08/29/spiritual-friendship-in-300-words/|website=www.spiritualfriendship.org|accessdate=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay Christian writer and actor [[Peterson Toscano]] argues that organizations promoting orientation change are a "ruse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turning off gays |first=Mark |last=Benjamin |newspaper=Salon.com |date=18 July 2005 |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/18/ungay/index.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525055244/http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/18/ungay/index.html |archivedate=25 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An organization he co-founded, Beyond Ex-Gay, supports people who feel they have been wounded by such organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondexgay.com/ |title=Beyond Ex-Gay Group for survivors of Ex-Gay ministries |publisher=Beyondexgay.com |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LGBT-affirming Christian denominations|Other groups]] support or advocate for gay Christians and their relationships. For example, in the United States, [[IntegrityUSA]] represents the interests of lesbian and gay Christians in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.integrityusa.org/ |title=Integrity (US Episcopal) |publisher=Integrityusa.org |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[United Methodist Church|United Methodists]] have the [[Reconciling Ministries Network]] and [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians have ''Evangelicals Concerned''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecwr.org/index.php |title=Evangelicals Concerned: Gay Christians |publisher=Ecwr.org |accessdate=12 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930014647/http://www.ecwr.org/index.php |archivedate=30 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the [[United Church of Christ]] filed a lawsuit challenging North Carolina’s ban on same-sex marriage, which is America’s first faith-based challenge to same-sex marriage bans; the [[Alliance of Baptists]] joined the lawsuit later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article9127277.html|title=Rabbis group joins N.C. same-sex marriage suit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/religion/2014/06/06/rabbis-join-marriage-equality-fight|title=Rabbis Join Marriage Equality Fight|date=6 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, lesbian and gay evangelical Christians have a European forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euroforumlgbtchristians.eu/home/home.asp European Forum of LGBT Christian Groups] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223050805/http://www.euroforumlgbtchristians.eu/home/home.asp |date=23 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Working within the worldwide Anglican Communion on a range of discrimination issues, including those of LGBT clergy and people in the church, is ''Inclusive Church''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inclusive-church.org.uk/ |title=Inclusive Church (Anglican) |publisher=Inclusive Church |accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The longest standing group for lesbian and gay Christians in the UK, founded in 1976, is the non-denominational [[Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgcm.org.uk/ |title=Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement (UK) |publisher=Lgcm.org.uk |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically aimed to meet the needs of lesbian and gay evangelicals, there is the ''Evangelical Fellowship for Lesbian and Gay Christians'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eflgc.org.uk/ |title=Evangelical Fellowship for Lesbian and Gay Christians (UK) |publisher=Eflgc.org.uk |date=7 November 2010 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically working within the Church of England is ''Changing Attitude'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changingattitude.org.uk/home/home.asp Changing Attitude (UK)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428103050/http://www.changingattitude.org.uk/home/home.asp |date=28 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which also takes an international focus in working for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender affirmation within the Anglican Communion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.changingattitude.org/home/home.asp |title=(International) |publisher=Changing Attitude |date=21 September 2010 |accessdate=12 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927073959/http://www.changingattitude.org/home/home.asp |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist Richard N. Pitt argues that these organizations are only available to LGBT members of liberal denominations, as opposed to those in conservative denominations. His review of the literature on gay Christians suggests that these organizations not only represent the interests of Christians who attend their churches, but (like gay-friendly and gay-affirming churches) also give these members useful responses to homophobic and heterosexist rhetoric. His research shows that those LGBT Christians who stay at homophobic churches "kill the messenger"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/123306098/HTMLSTART |title="Killing The Messenger"|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01492.x |date=1 March 2010 |accessdate=12 November 2011 |volume=49 |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |pages=56–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; by attacking the minister's knowledge about homosexuality, personal morality, focus on sin instead of forgiveness, and motivations for preaching against homosexuality.

{{Sangam literature}}

'''Siruppanchamulam'''(Tamil: சிருப்பஞ்சமுலம்) is a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] poetic work of [[didactic]] nature belonging to the ''[[Pathinenkilkanakku]]'' anthology of [[Tamil literature]]. This belongs to the 'post [[Sangam period]]' corresponding to between 100 – 500 CE. ''Siruppanchamulam'' contains 100 poems written by the poet Kariyaasaan. He was probably a [[Jain]] by religious persuasion. This and the fact that he was a student of one Makkayanaar is known from the introductory poem of this book. The poems of ''Siruppanchamulam'' are written in the [[Venpa]] meter.

''Siruppanchamulam'' uses the analogy of the traditional herbal medicine, which uses the roots of the five herbs ''kandankatthiri'' (a plant of the [[nightshade]] family – ''[[Solanum]] xanthocarpum''), ''siruvzhuthunai'', ''sirumalli'', ''perumalli'', and ''nerunji'' (a thorny prostrate plant – ''[[Tribulus terrestris]]'')  to cure certain maladies. ''Siruppanchamulam'' similarly uses five different [[maxim (philosophy)|maxims]] to illustrate correct behaviour.

The following poem lists the five things, namely, a chaste girl, the humility of the learned, friendly neighbouring countries, benevolent kings under whose reign there are timely rains and loyal assistants as sweet as ambrosia.

: கற்புடைய பெண் அமிர்து, கற்று அடங்கினான் அமிர்து
: நற்புடைய நாடுஅமிர்து - நற்புடைய
: மேகமே சேர்கொடி வேந்து அமிர்து, சேவகனும்
: ஆகவே செய்யின் அமிர்து.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5118">'''Contextual theology''' or '''contextualizing theology''' refers to theology which has responded to the dynamics of a particular context.

== Terminology ==
The term contextualizing theology was used in [[missiology]] by [[Shoki Coe]] when he argued that the [[Henry Venn (Church Missionary Society)|Venn]]-[[Rufus Anderson|Anderson]] three-self principles were inadequate in addressing the sociopolitical context of his native Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coe|first1=Shoki|title=In Search of Renewal in Theological Education|journal=Theological Education|date=Summer 1973|volume=9|issue=4|pages=233–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coe|first1=Shoki|title=Theological Education--a Worldwide Perspective|journal=Theological Education|date=Autumn 1974|volume=11|issue=1|pages=5–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coe would popularize this notion through the Theological Education Fund of the [[World Council of Churches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wheeler|first=Ray|title=The legacy of Shoki Coe|date=April 2002|journal=International Bulletin of Missionary Research|volume=26|issue=2|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it was initially understood as part of a [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] approach to theology, it has grown in currency among [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]] and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]].&lt;ref name="Wu2015"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LtITrgEACAAJ|title=One Gospel for All Nations: A Practical Approach to Biblical Contextualization|last=Wu|first=Jackson|date=April 2015|publisher=William Carey Library Publishers|isbn=978-0-87808-629-0|location=Pasadena, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bevans2002" /&gt;

An individual may come from a particular cultural [[worldview]], such as [[Arab world|Arabic]] or [[Asia]]n culture, or be faced with particular sociopolitical issues. Hence, examples of contextualized theologies include [[Latin America]]n [[liberation theology]], [[Minjung theology]], and [[African theology]].&lt;ref name="KarkkainenKyoungJae2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZHkAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1|title=Asian Contextual Theology for the Third Millennium: Theology of Minjung in Fourth-Eye Formation|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishing|year=2007|isbn=978-0-227-17331-2|editor-last1=Chung|editor-first1=Paul S.|location=Eugene, OR|editor-last2=Kim Kyoung-Jae|editor-first2=|editor-last3=Kärkkäinen|editor-first3=Veli-Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bergmann2017"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXJBDgAAQBAJ|title=God in Context: A Survey of Contextual Theology|last=Bergmann|first=Sigurd|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=978-1-351-93280-6|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Systematic theology|systematic theologian]] [[Regunta Yesurathnam]] sees contextual theology as including "all that is implied in [[indigenization]] or [[inculturation]], but also seeks also to include the realities of contemporary, secularity, technology, and the struggle for human justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Van Engen  | first = Charles E.  | contribution = Toward a Contextually Appropriate Methodology in Mission Theology  | year = 2005  | title = Appropriate Christianity  | editor-last = Kraft  | editor-first = Charles H.  | page = 194  | place = Pasadena  | publisher = William Carey Library}} {{ISBN|0-87808-358-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The missiologist Stephen Bevans argues that there is no such thing as normative theology, that "doing theology contextually is not an option" since it is a human enterprise which is created within a particular human context.&lt;ref name="Bevans2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bevans|first=Stephen B. |title=Models of Contextual Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ukPAQAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|isbn=978-1-57075-438-8|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biblical studies ==
In the field of [[Bible translations|Bible translation]] and [[Biblical hermeneutics|interpretation]], contextualization is the process of assigning [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] as a means of [[Meaning (non-linguistic)#Meaning as internal interpretation|interpreting]] the environment within which a text or [[Action (philosophy)|action]] is executed.

Contextualization is used in the study of Bible translations in relation to their relevant [[cultural]] settings. Derived from the practice of [[hermeneutics]], it sought to understand the use of words borrowed into the [[Hebrew Scriptures]], and later their Greek and Latin translations.

The word continues to be used theologically, mainly in the sense of contextualizing the biblical message as perceived in the missionary mandate originated by Jesus in the [[gospel]] accounts. However, since the early 1970s, the word's meaning has widened. It is now used by [[secular]], religious and political groups to render their message into different settings by adjusting or accommodating words, phrases or meanings into understandable contexts in  [[respondent]] cultures.

'''''Deadly Premonition'''''{{efn|Known as {{nihongo|'''''Red Seeds Profile'''''|レッドシーズプロファイル}} in Japan.}} is a [[survival horror]] video game developed by [[Access Games]] for [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. Set in the fictional, rural American town of Greenvale, [[Washington (state)|Washington]], the story follows [[FBI Special Agent]] Francis York Morgan as he investigates the murder of an eighteen-year-old woman, which bears similarities to a series of murders across the country. ''Deadly Premonition'' was originally released in 2010 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3; the Xbox 360 version was published by [[Ignition Entertainment]] in North America, [[Marvelous Entertainment]] in Japan, and [[Rising Star Games]] in Europe. Marvelous Entertainment released the PlayStation 3 version exclusively in Japan. A [[director's cut]] edition for PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows was released worldwide by Rising Star Games in 2013.

''Deadly Premonition'' is a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of Access Games' earlier video game ''Rainy Woods''. In production since 2004, ''Rainy Woods'' was cancelled soon after its debut at the 2007 convention [[Tokyo Game Show]] due to technical issues. Upon its release, ''Deadly Premonition'' received wildly varying critical reviews, eventually holding the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the most critically polarizing survival horror game. It has since garnered a [[cult following]] and has been cited as an example of [[Video games as an art form|games as art]].

A map of the town relative to York's position is in the lower left, while his heath and sleepiness/heartbeat bars are in the upper left; in the lower right is text noting what weapon is equipped.]]
''Deadly Premonition'' is a [[Survival horror|survival horror game]] set in an [[open world]] environment and played from an [[Third-person shooter|over-the shoulder]] [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. The game's objective is to guide the [[player character]], [[FBI Special Agent]] Francis York Morgan, as he investigates the identity of the Raincoat Killer, who is responsible for a murder in the rural town of Greenvale.&lt;ref name="PALGN"/&gt; York receives in-game money for numerous actions—both for finishing [[Level (video game)|levels]] and for minor events, such as shaving or changing suits; he can also be fined for poor performance, such as wearing dirty clothes.&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;{{cite book|title=Deadly Premonition|publisher=[[Ignition Entertainment]]|pages=8–10, 14, 18, 22, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; Additionally, he requires food and sleep at regular intervals, as indicated by the gauges measuring his hunger and need for sleep.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; If his gauge for sleepiness reaches zero, he will become hungry more quickly; if his gauge for hunger depletes, he will begin to lose [[Health (gaming)|health]].&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; Sleeping restores his health and tiredness, while food and items to ward off sleepiness, such as coffee, can be purchased from stores in Greenvale.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

York may explore Greenvale on foot, by car, or by using a special item obtained by completing a [[sidequest]].&lt;ref name="PALGN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; Cars must be maintained, as they consume fuel, which York must purchase, and accumulate damage that eventually renders them useless unless York pays for their repair.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; York often has a specific time frame for investigating sites and interviewing [[non-player characters]]; however, if he misses the timeslot, the player may simply try again during the next day without a penalty.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; Places of business and entertainment venues in Greenvale have specific hours of operation and must be visited at the proper time to make use of their services. Non-player characters also have their own specific routines and travel around town as they go about their business.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; It also features a dynamic weather system and day-night cycle which affects the responses of the non-player characters.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; If York engages one at the right place and time of day, he or she may offer him a side-quest to perform for additional rewards.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; In addition to side-quests, trading cards are scattered throughout the town, which the player can collect while exploring. York can also participate in [[mini-games]], such as [[darts]], racing through checkpoints, and fishing,&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; and may accelerate the passing of time by smoking cigarettes.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

''Deadly Premonition'' contains several combat sequences, in which York encounters supernatural enemies while trapped in the Other World. York may battle them using [[melee weapons]] or firearms, or may choose to evade them by holding his breath.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt; Melee weapons will eventually break with continued use,&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; and York's pulse increases whenever he runs or holds his breath.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt; Periodically, York encounters the Raincoat Killer, which will activate either a [[quick time event]], a chase sequence, or a hiding event necessary to escape the murderer.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; During the Other World sequences, York's primary objective is to investigate crimes that took place there in the recent past. He collects photos of evidence to use to "profile" the scene and reconstruct events that took place with his deductive skills.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; Furthermore, the Other World regularly affects the entire town, excepting the interior of buildings, from midnight to six in the morning.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
''Deadly Premonition'' is set in a [[fictional universe]], in which good and evil are spread by the messengers influenced by the Forest and Red Tree respectively.&lt;ref name="Swery blog background"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessgames-blog.com/swery65/2011/11/swery-4d56.html|title=SWERYインタビュー記事のご紹介|author=[[Hidetaka Suehiro|Suehiro, Hidetaka]]|date=2011-11-02|publisher=[[Access Games]]|language=Japanese, English|accessdate=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrasting pairs play a role in the game, such as "good and evil, reality and abnormality, earthly life and eternal life, day and night, criminals and victims, the forest and the red tree, and twins and dual personalities."&lt;ref name="Swery blog background"/&gt; Throughout the game, the [[protagonist]], Francis York Morgan (Jeff Kramer), periodically visits two supernatural rooms: the White Room and the Red Room. The White Room represents a normal [[subconscious]], while the Red Room represents one influenced by evil.&lt;ref name="eurogamer interview"/&gt;

===Plot===
Francis York Morgan investigates the murder of 18-year-old Anna Graham ([[Melissa Hutchison]]) in the rural town of Greenvale, [[Washington (state)|Washington]], in the United States.&lt;ref name="Game Informer"/&gt; He takes on the case due to the manner of the killing: a ritualistic murder of a young woman where red seeds have been found on or near the body, similar to a series of other murders across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Deadly Premonition|developer=[[Access Games]]|publisher=[[Ignition Entertainment]]|level=Episode 1, Chapter 3: Autopsy report}}&lt;/ref&gt; York generates considerable friction with his dismissive attitude toward the locals, bizarre demeanor, and tendency to interrupt conversations to deliver [[asides]] to an unseen person he refers to as "Zach".&lt;ref name="Chapter 7"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Deadly Premonition|developer=[[Access Games]]|publisher=[[Ignition Entertainment]]|level=Episode 1, Chapter 7: Murder site}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is assisted by the town's [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] George Woodman (Casey Robertson), who is scarred by a past of childhood abuse; the [[deputy sheriff]] Emily Wyatt (Rebecca Wink), who moved to the town from [[Seattle]] during her high-school years; and Thomas MacLaine (Christopher Sullivan), George's meek assistant who excels at cooking.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Deadly Premonition|developer=[[Access Games]]|publisher=[[Ignition Entertainment]]|level=Episode 1, Chapter 2: Sheriff's office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, York finds himself regularly ambushed and attacked by the Raincoat Killer, who, according to the folklore of the town, kills only when it rains.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7"/&gt;

As the investigation continues, Anna's close friend Becky Ames (Amy Provenzano) and Diane (Christiane Crawford), Becky's elder sister and art gallery owner, are murdered in a similar fashion, with a mark placed nearby that York believes to be a [[peace symbol]] upside-down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Deadly Premonition|developer=[[Access Games]]|publisher=[[Ignition Entertainment]]|level=Episode 2, Chapter 10: the 2nd sacrifice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Deadly Premonition|developer=[[Access Games]]|publisher=[[Ignition Entertainment]]|level=Episode 2, Chapter 12: Fallen goddess}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learns that the red seeds originate from Greenvale and that there are two Raincoat Killers. The original one, who inspired the folklore, went on a killing spree after the United States military released gas made from the red seeds into the town in 1956, causing the residents to temporarily experience an uncontrollable, murderous rage. The second, the New Raincoat Killer, hopes to gain immortality by consuming the red seeds and murdering four people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|developer=Access Games|publisher=Ignition Entertainment|title=Deadly Premonition|level=Episode 3, Chapter 14: the 13th bell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

York suspects Thomas' involvement in the crimes and is subsequently kidnapped by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|developer=Access Games|publisher=Ignition Entertainment|title=Deadly Premonition|level=Episode 3, Chapter 20: Cruel device}}&lt;/ref&gt; York realizes his romantic feelings for Emily, who searches for him with Forrest Kaysen ([[Doug Boyd]]), a traveling tree salesman. During a confrontation with her, Thomas—who belongs to a secret club built by George, together with his younger sister Carol (Amy Rubinate)—falls on a hook, dying in the process. York reveals that he believes the copycat raincoat killer is George.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|developer=Access Games|publisher=Ignition Entertainment|title=Deadly Premonition|level=Episode 4, Chapter 21: Cat fight}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emily and York find the final victim, Carol, dying; Carol then forces Emily to ingest some of the red seeds out of jealousy that George only loves her. York then leaves Emily in Kaysen's care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|developer=Access Games|publisher=Ignition Entertainment|title=Deadly Premonition|level=Episode 4, Chapter 22: Throne of abyss}}&lt;/ref&gt; He confronts George (who confesses to being the murderer and has gained shape-shifting powers as the result of eating the red seeds) and kills him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|developer=Access Games|publisher=Ignition Entertainment|title=Deadly Premonition|level=Episode 5, Chapter 23: Dawn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterward, York realizes that, while George was the Greenvale killer, he could not have been responsible for the other similar murders nationwide and was likely just a pawn. He eventually discovers that Kaysen is responsible, and that the symbol seen close to all the victims was a tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|developer=Access Games|publisher=Ignition Entertainment|title=Deadly Premonition|level=Episode 5, Chapter 24: Red tree}}&lt;/ref&gt; York finds that Kaysen has planted a tree inside Emily's stomach, and the sight causes him to recover his [[Repressed memory|repressed memories]]: as a child, Zach witnessed his mother (Rebecca Wink) dying with a tree sprouting from her body, with his father (David Rosenthal) and Kaysen in the room. His father was unable to kill her out of mercy, leading to a more agonising death for her, and then he killed himself. Unable to cope with the trauma, Zach psychologically switched places with his newly created [[Multiple personality disorder|other personality]], York. Though unable to save Emily, Zach kills Kaysen, a supernatural entity from the Red World and messenger of the Red Tree,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Deadly Premonition|developer=Access Games|publisher=Ignition Entertainment|level=Episode 6, Chapter 25: Zach Morgan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leaves the town with optimism for his future. In the closing scene, York, Emily, Thomas, and all of the Greenvale murder victims are seen happily existing in the alternate reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Deadly Premonition|developer=Access Games|publisher=Ignition Entertainment|level=Episode 7, Chapter 26: Epilogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box
 |quote  = As I said, the original concept of this game is, 'living in and feeling part of the town.' Even if the player is an efficient FBI agent, he will also become hungry, sleepy, and stinky if he didn't bathe at all. This doesn't change even if zombies appear in the town or even if serial murders occur. It also means we are not perfect, just human. I wanted to bring reality into the game using those factors.

''Deadly Premonition'' originates from ''Rainy Woods'', a game that [[Access Games]] began work on in 2004.&lt;ref name="polygon interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/2/12/3977154/the-sinners-sandwich-deadly-premonitions-creator-on-making-a-good-bad|title=The Sinner's Sandwich: Deadly Premonition's Creator on Making a Good Bad Game|work=Polygon| first=Phillip| last=Kohler|date=Feb 12, 2013 |accessdate=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rainy Woods'' debuted as a [[cross-platform|multi-platform]] title for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox 360]] game consoles during the [[Tokyo Game Show|Tokyo Game Show 2007]], during which several [[Video game journalism|video game journalists]] noted that the title shared strong similarities with the American supernatural television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]''.&lt;ref name="eurogamer interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-02-20-swery-the-accidental-hero|title=The Cult of Swery|author=Robinson, Martin|date=2013-02-20|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cult of DP"/&gt; It featured the "young and very cynical" FBI Special Agent David Young Henning as its protagonist.&lt;ref name="eurogamer interview"/&gt; ''Rainy Woods'' was cancelled soon after its debut,&lt;ref name="eurogamer interview"/&gt; as, according to Suehiro, "with the differences in memory allocation, lighting, and various other hardware differences between the platforms, there were a lot of large technological difficulties that prevented us from really getting started."&lt;ref name="Cult of DP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-07-the-cult-of-deadly-premonition-article|title=The Cult of Deadly Premonition Article|author=Schilling, Chris|date=2011-07-07|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Access Games began work on ''Deadly Premonition'', which was intended to be a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of ''Rainy Woods'',&lt;ref name="Swery Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.accessgames-blog.com/swery65/2012/01/10top100-856c.html|date=2012-01-10|title=ありがとう10周年　ありがとうTOP100選出|author=[[Hidetaka Suehiro|Suehiro, Hidetaka]]|work=Cafe Swery65|publisher=[[Access Games]]|language=English, Japanese|accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the project faced cancellation four times.&lt;ref name="eurogamer interview"/&gt; The budget for the overall project, according to Suehiro, was "[n]ot very much."&lt;ref name="Postmortem"/&gt; Suehiro created a new protagonist, Francis York Morgan, with help from his friends in the United States,&lt;ref name="eurogamer interview"/&gt; and he and Kenji Gota, an [[independent film]] director, created York's dialogue with his split personality, Zach.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134242/thank_you_and_guys_i_love_you__.php?page=2|title=Thank You And Guys, I Love You!! – Swery Interview|page=2|author=Sheffield, Brandon|date=2010-06-21|work=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Gota and Suehiro are good friends and often have conversations about film, Suehiro tried to bring that atmosphere to the dialogue.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra interview"/&gt; Additionally, they wrote the main plotline, while Suehiro wrote eighty percent of the sidequests and all of York's conversations with the nonplayer characters.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra interview"/&gt; The character Zach was intended to involve the player more in the game; according to Suehiro, "Agent York arrives in Greenvale to solve a murder case. But, the player lives this scene from his living room in front of the TV. To fill this gap, I needed something to create the illusion, without turning the character into an avatar, that the user was the main character."&lt;ref name="Gamasutra interview 3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134242/thank_you_and_guys_i_love_you__.php?page=3|title=Thank You And Guys, I Love You!! – Swery Interview|page=3|author=Sheffield, Brandon|date=2010-06-21|work=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central focus of the gameplay is freedom for the player, as Suehiro had wanted to create a game that the player could progress at his or her own speed.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra interview 3"/&gt; He had planned to incorporate two more mini-games involving chess and perfume,&lt;ref name="Cult of DP"/&gt; and had considered having the player character's weight and hair length fluctuate.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra interview 3"/&gt; Additionally, the combat sections of ''Deadly Premonition'' were added last in development,&lt;ref name="Gamasutra interview 3"/&gt; after a publisher worried that the game would not sell well in the [[West]] without it.&lt;ref name="polygon interview"/&gt; Aspects of the game were initially more violent as well, as a way to express the [[fear of death]]; for example, the second victim was intended to be disembowelled while still living. However, the scenes were later toned down, as Suehiro felt that they were "too extreme".&lt;ref name="Destructoid interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deadly Premonition: the cult of split-personality|url=http://www.destructoid.com/deadly-premonition-the-cult-of-split-personality-237185.phtml#ext|work=Destructoid|accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suehiro's guiding concepts for the game's setting focused on "'real time,' 'real scale,' and 'real life.'"&lt;ref name="Postmortem"/&gt; The developers traveled to the United States and noted the width measurements of the various billboards, [[railroad crossing]]s, and roads to create a sense of realism for the town;&lt;ref name="Postmortem"/&gt; the angles of the sun and weather patterns were also calculated.&lt;ref name="Postmortem"/&gt; To add to that sense of realism, every street in Greenvale is named, and an hourly wage was decided on for a local diner.&lt;ref name="Postmortem"/&gt; Additionally, the daily schedules of the non-player characters were created from their detailed background profiles.&lt;ref name="Postmortem"/&gt;

Areas of difficulties in the game's development were memory allocation, various lighting and shadow aspects, and their use of the [[physics engine]] [[PhysX]].&lt;ref name="Postmortem"/&gt; According to Wataru Nishide, the lead level artist, and J's Kataoka, the lead programmer, "''Deadly Premonition'' was our first stab at next-generation development, so we began the project astounded by the vast amount of RAM available--much more than any previous consumer hardware had offered. Astonishment gave rise to overconfidence, and eventually to the worst-case scenario: our data management became sloppy."&lt;ref name="Postmortem"/&gt; The team found a balance between the practicalities of the available memory with the desired aesthetic of the outdoor sections of the game, which initially contained too many objects.&lt;ref name="Postmortem"/&gt; The developers also had difficulties with balancing the game's lighting, desired aesthetics of the game's shadows and the processing rate.&lt;ref name="Postmortem"/&gt; Furthermore, their use of PhysX proved to have mixed results; the developers enjoyed the "dynamic expression" that it gave the game's world, but had problems with the inability to "cheat" the "brutally honest" simulation and    the resulting toll on the frame rate and processing.&lt;ref name="Postmortem"/&gt; Initially, the team "had everything that could possibly be displayed with a physics engine running through PhysX--hair, clothing, even fishing rods", which they had to cut back to preserve the frame rate.&lt;ref name="Postmortem"/&gt;
 
===Audio===
To help the composers understand the aesthetic of ''Deadly Premonition'', the developers hummed ideas for songs, let them see concept designs, and played music that matched a certain feeling that they wished to convey.&lt;ref name="Postmortem"/&gt; "Life is Beautiful", which uses [[whistling]] to evoke a calm walk in the countryside, was easily composed, along with "York and Zach", which appears during York's monologues.

The plot was positively received as "quirky"&lt;ref name="Game Informer"/&gt; and "bizarre and entertaining".&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt; A reviewer for [[Edge (magazine)|''Edge'']] wrote: "The beauty of Deadly Premonition is that it's a straightforward whodunnit viewed through the cracked prism of an unreliable narrator, conjuring an atmosphere of suspicion and confusion throughout."&lt;ref name="mc"/&gt; According to ''[[Destructoid]]''{{'}}s Jim Sterling, after the prologue, ''Deadly Premonition'' "becomes a ludicrous pantomime of pop culture references, shamelessly contrived humor, and the kind of dialog that leaves you both scratching your head and laughing your face off."&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt; The characters were positively received by reviewers as memorable,&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; endearing,&lt;ref name="IGN UK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; "fascinating",&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; and "charming".&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt;  Tom Hoggins of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' remarked that the characters served as "cartoon interpretations of small-town Americana" with distinct personalities.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8085630/Deadly-Premonition-video-game-review.html|title=Deadly Premonition video game review|author=Hoggins, Tom|date=2010-10-29|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=|accessdate=2015-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to IGN UK, the interaction with characters and uncovering the details of their fictional lives helped "to fashion a genuine, albeit silly, emotional core - and its payoff resonates long after the credits have rolled as a result."&lt;ref name="IGN UK"/&gt; Matt Keil of [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]] described York as "an oddly enMdearing character considering his arrogant behavior early on", with his love of films, video games, and music being a highlight.&lt;ref name="G4TV review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/games/xbox-360/62985/Deadly-Premonition/review/|title=Deadly Premonition Review for Xbox360|author=Keil, Matt|date=2010-05-12|work=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]]|publisher=G4 Media LLC|accessdate=2015-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eurogamer summed him up as "a grade-A fruit-loop with a side of narcissism, and one of the most interesting gaming protagonists for years."&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; Reviewers also saw similarities in ''Deadly Premonition''{{'}}s characters with those of ''Twin Peaks''.&lt;ref name="Game Informer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/deadly_premonition/b/xbox360/archive/2010/04/16/amazing-coffee-questionable-gameplay.aspx|title=Amazing Coffee, Questionable Gameplay – Deadly Premonition|date=2010-04-16|author=Kollar, Phil|work=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G4TV review"/&gt;

The gameplay received a range of critical reaction, from competently done for a budget title&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt; to horribly executed.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; The gameplay of ''Deadly Premonition'' drew comparisons to that of ''[[Shenmue]]''&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1UP"/&gt; the ''[[Clock Tower (series)|Clock Tower]]'' series,&lt;ref name="VideoGamer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/deadly_premonition/review-2.html|title=Deadly Premontion Review for Xbox 360|author=Kelly, Neon|work=VideoGamer.com|publisher=Pro-G Media|accessdate=2015-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its combat was compared to that of ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1UP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN UK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; According to [[1UP.com|1UP]]'s Frank Cifaldi, ''Deadly Premonition''{{'}}s combination of similar gameplay to ''Shenmue'', ''[[The Last Express]]'', ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'', and the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series, proved to be "a '[[jack of all trades, master of none]]' scenario."&lt;ref name="1UP"/&gt; Erik Brudvig of IGN US wrote: "The ''Twin Peaks'' meets ''Resident Evil'' with a dash of ''Grand Theft Auto'' formula sounds pretty great, but it was well beyond the capabilities of this development team."&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; The controls were criticized as detracting from the game's appeal.&lt;ref name="Game Informer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VideoGamer"/&gt; The combat sections received mixed reactions. IGN UK's Matt Wales wrote that while the combat was "simplistic", the atmosphere and profiling worked nicely.&lt;ref name="IGN UK"/&gt;  According to [[Eurogamer]]'s Chris Shilling, the sudden appearances of the Raincoat Killer made the sections frightening and the profiling made for some unsettling yet "relatively restrained" moments of horror, despite the "over-long and frequently clumsy" combat sequences.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; Kevin VanOrd of [[GameSpot]] described the supernatural enemies as not particularly aggressive and boss battles as taking too long.&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt;

Further criticism was directed at the game's music and visual quality. The graphics were frequently remarked upon as "terrible"&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PALGN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Metro"/&gt; and low quality.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt; [[IGN]]'s Erik Brudvig wrote that "[t]he graphics make this title look like a bad PS2 game."&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deadly Premonition Review|last=Brudvig| first=Erik|date=2010-02-23|work=IGN|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/107/1070909p1.html|accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PALGN]]'s Bev Chen, in contrast, felt that the quality of the graphics "heap another helping of bizarre charm on the game."&lt;ref name="PALGN"/&gt; Similarly, the game's soundtrack received criticism as sometimes thematically inappropriate, with serious scenes often containing a light-hearted jazz track;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Metro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PALGN"/&gt;&lt;ref name=XPlay/&gt; conversely, some critics found the soundtrack memorable&lt;ref name="Game Informer"/&gt; and enjoyable, though repetitive in its selection.&lt;ref name="IGN UK"/&gt; 

Nevertheless, the game has received a significant [[Cult video game|cult following]].&lt;ref name="GamePro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/108/1081757p1.html|title=Ignition Entertainment Announces Deadly Premonition: Game of the Year Edition Now Available - Xbox 360 News at IGN|work=IGN| date=2010-04-05|accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cult success was attributed to how the game's "wildly mixed critical reception and headline-making strangeness got people talking" by Will Herring of ''[[GamePro]]''.&lt;ref name="GamePro"&gt;{{cite web| title=When You're Strange: The Story of Deadly Premonition|first=Will|last=Herring|date=2010-05-13|work=[[GamePro]]|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/215173/when-youre-strange-the-story-of-deadly-premonition/|accessdate=2011-03-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715050107/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/215173/when-youre-strange-the-story-of-deadly-premonition/|archivedate=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the game as an example of "[[Art game|video games as art]]", David Jenkins of the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' praised it for its "emotional range, from traditional survival horror scares to farcical comedy".&lt;ref name="Metro"&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Jenkins|date=2010-11-02|title=Games review: Deadly Premonition is one of a kind|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/games/845905-games-review-deadly-premonition-is-one-of-a-kind|accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]]TV named it one of the "Top 10 Games of 2010...

'''Françoise Mouly''' ({{IPA-fr|muli|lang}}; born 24 October 1955)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spiegelman|first1=Art|title=Metamaus: A Look Inside a Modern Classic, Maus|date=2011|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|isbn=978-0-375-42394-9|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Paris-born New York-based designer, editor, and publisher.  She is best known as co-founder, co-editor, and publisher of the comics and graphics magazine ''[[Raw (magazine)|Raw]]'' (1980–1991), as the publisher of Raw Books and [[Toon Books]], and since 1993 as the art editor of ''[[The New Yorker]]''.  Mouly is married to cartoonist [[Art Spiegelman]], and is the mother of writer [[Nadja Spiegelman]].

As editor and publisher, Mouly has had considerable influence on the rise in production values in the English-language comics world since the early 1980s.  She has played a role in providing outlets to new and foreign cartoonists, and in promoting comics as a serious artform and as an educational tool.  The French government decorated Mouly as a Knight of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Order of Arts and Letters]] in 2001, and as Knight of the [[Legion of Honour]] in 2011.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Mouly was born in 1955 in Paris, France, the second of three daughters to Josée and Roger Mouly.  She grew up in the well-to-do [[17th arrondissement of Paris]].{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=20}}  Her father was a plastic surgeon{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=15}} who in 1951 developed with Charles Dufourmentel the Dufourmentel-Mouly method of breast reduction.{{sfn|Santoni-Rugiu|Sykes|2007|p=339}}  The French government made him a Knight of the [[Legion of Honour]].{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=15}}

[[File:Paris 17e arr jms.gif|thumb|left|alt=Map of Paris, with the 17th arrondisement, where Mouly grew up, highlighted|Mouly grew up in the [[17th arrondissement of Paris|17th arrondissement]] (''in pink'') of Paris, France.]]

From a young age Mouly had a love of reading, including novels, illustrated fairytale collections, comics magazines such as ''[[Pilote]]'', and comics albums such as ''[[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]''.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=16–17}}  She excelled as a student, and her parents planned to have her study medicine and follow her father into plastic surgery.  She spent vacation time assisting and observing her father at work.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=17–18}}  She was troubled with the ethics of plastic surgery, though, which she said "exploits insecurity to such a high degree".{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=18, 20}}

At thirteen, Mouly witnessed the [[May 1968 events in France]].  The events led to Mouly's mother and sisters fleeing Paris.  Her father stayed to be available to his patients, and Mouly stayed as his assistant.  She developed sympathies with the anarchists, and read the weekly radical ''[[Hara-Kiri (magazine)|Hara-Kiri Hebdo]]''.{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=20}}  She brought her radical leftist politics with her when her parents sent her in 1970 to the [[Lycée Jeanne D'Arc]]&lt;!-- which one? --&gt; in central France, where she has said she was expelled "twenty-four or twenty-five times because {{interp|she}} was trying to drag everyone to demonstrations".{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=20–21}}

Mouly's father was disappointed when, upon Mouly's return to Paris, she chose to forgo medicine to study architecture at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]].  She lived with a boyfriend in the [[Latin Quarter, Paris|Latin Quarter]] and traveled widely in Europe, took a two-and-a-half-month van trip with friends in 1972 that reached Afghanistan, and made a solo trip to [[Algeria]] in 1974 to study the [[vernacular architecture]], during which she was robbed of her passport and money.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=21–23}}

Mouly grew disenchanted with the lack of creative freedom a career in architecture would present her.  Her family life had grown stressful, and her parents divorced in 1974.  The same year, she broke off her studies and cleaned in a hotel to save money towards traveling to New York.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=21–23}}

===Move to New York===

With no concrete plans, Mouly arrived in New York September 2, 1974, with $200 in the midst of a severe economic downturn.  She familiarized herself into the New York avant-garde art and film worlds, and had a part in [[Richard Foreman]]'s 1975 play ''Pandering to the Masses''.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=25–26}}  She settled into a loft in [[SoHo]] in 1975,{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=26}} and did odd jobs including selling cigarettes and magazines in [[Grand Central Station]] and assembling models for a Japanese architectural company, while struggling to improve her English.{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=27}}

While looking for comics from which to practice reading English, she came across ''[[Arcade (comics magazine)|Arcade]]'', an {{not a typo|[[underground comix]]}} magazine from San Francisco co-published by New Yorker [[Art Spiegelman]].  Avant-garde filmmaker friend [[Ken Jacobs]] introduced Mouly and Spiegelman, when Spiegelman was visiting, but they did not immediately develop a mutual interest.  Spiegelman moved permanently back to New York later in the year. Occasionally the two ran across each other.  After reading Spiegelman's 1973 strip "Prisoner on the Hell Planet", about his mother's suicide, Mouly felt the urge to contact him.  An eight-hour phone call led to a deepening of their relationship.  Spiegelman followed her to France when she had to return to fulfill obligations in her architecture course.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=28–30}}  After returning to the United States, when Mouly ran into visa problems in 1977, the couple solved them by getting married—first at City Hall, and then again after Mouly converted to Judaism to please Spiegelman's father.{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=41}}  Beginning in 1978 Mouly and Spiegelman made yearly trips to Europe to explore the comics scene, and brought back European comics to show to their circle of friends.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=47–48}}

Mouly became immersed in Spiegelman's personal theories of comics, and helped him prepare the lecture "Language of the Comics" delivered at the [[Collective for Living Cinema]].{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=43–44}}  She assisted in the putting together the lavish collection of Spiegelman's experimental strips ''[[Breakdowns (comics)|Breakdowns]]''.  The printer botched the printing of the book—30% of the print run was unusable.  The remaining copies had poor distribution and sales.  The experience motivated Mouly to gain control over the printing process, and to find a way to get such marginal material to sympathetic readers.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=45–47}}  She took courses in [[offset printing]] in [[Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn]], and bought an Addressograph-Multigraph Multilith printing press for her loft.{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=49}}

===Raw Books===

In 1978, she founded Raw Books and Graphics, a name settled on in part because of its small-operation feel, and part because it was reminiscent of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine.  Mouly worked from an aesthetic inspired in part by the Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivists]], who brought a design sense to everyday objects.{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=50}}  Raw Books began by publishing postcards and prints by artists such as underground cartoonist [[Bill Griffith]] and Dutch cartoonist [[Joost Swarte]].{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=48}}  More ambitious projects included art objects such as the Zippy-Scope, a cardboard device with to watch a comic strip rolled up on a film spool, featuring Griffth's character [[Zippy the Pinhead]].{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=51–52}}  Some projects were more commercial, such as the annual ''Streets of SoHo Map and Guide'', whose advertising revenue financed much of Raw Books.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=52–53}}

Having in this way honed her publishing skills, Mouly's ambition turned to magazine publication.  Spiegelman was at first reluctant, jaded from his experience at ''Arcade'', but agreed on New Year's Eve 1979 to co-edit.  The magazine was to provide an outlet for the kinds of comics that had difficulty finding a publisher in the US, in particular younger cartoonists who fit neither the superhero nor the underground mold, and European cartoonists who did not fit the sex-and-sci-fi appetites of ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' fans.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=53–54}}

In the midst of a commercial and artistic fallow period in the American comics industry, the lavishly-printed, {{convert|10+1/2|x|14+1/8|in|cm|abbr=on}} first issue of ''[[Raw (magazine)|Raw]]'' appeared in July 1980.  Its production values resulted in a $3.50 cover price, several times the going prices for comics, either mainstream or underground.  Among the comics it contained was the only strip Mouly herself was to produce, "Industry News and Review No. 6", an autobiographical strip in which she contemplates her late-1970s anxieties and thoughts of suicide.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=55—56}}  Other strips in the eclectic anthology included an example of the early 20th-century newspaper strip ''[[Dream of the Rarebit Fiend]]'' by [[Winsor McCay]], and an excerpt from ''Manhattan'' by contemporary French cartoonist [[Jacques Tardi]].{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=59}}  To comics academic Jeet Heer, ''Raw'' was "a singular mixture of visual diversity and thematic unity".{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=68}}  Each issue contained a broad variety of styles linked by a common theme, be it urban despair, suicide, or a vision of America through foreign eyes.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=68–69}}  The best-known work to run in ''Raw'' was a serialization of Spiegelman's graphic novel ''[[Maus]]'',{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=75}} which ran as an insert for the duration of the magazine{{sfn|Kaplan|2006|p=113}} from the December 1980 second issue.{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=171}}

Mouly's approach was hands-on, and she gave great attention to every step of the printing process.  The physicality of ''Raw'' was evident in each issue: tipped-in plates, bubblegum cards, and torn covers were part of the aesthetic of the magazine, accomplished by hand by Mouly, Spiegelman, and friends at gatherings after the printing of a new issue.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=61–62}}  Mouly was also hands-on when dealing with contributors, suggesting ideas and changes—an approach anathema to the editor-adverse underground spirit, but artists welcomed her input as in the end she did not interfere with their autonomy.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=67–68}}

''Raw'' had a strong critical reception, and also sold surprisingly well.{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=71}}  It was not without its critics, who charged it with being highbrow and elitist,{{sfnm|1a1=Heer|1y=2013|1pp=71–72, 74–75|2a1=Duncan|2y=2010|2p=654}} or claimed it to be a one-man Spiegelman show.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=71–72, 74–75}}  Pioneer underground cartoonist [[Robert Crumb]] responded in 1981 with the magazine ''[[Weirdo (magazine)|Weirdo]]'', intended to remain free of editorial intrusion and stay true to comics' lowbrow roots.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=71–72}}

Raw Books published ten ''One Shot'' books throughout the 1980s by cartoonists such as [[Gary Panter]], [[Sue Coe]], and [[Jerry Moriarty]].  Mouly brought a similar production sensibility to these books to what she brought to ''Raw'': the cover to Panter's ''Jimbo'' was corrugated cardboard pasted with stickers of the book's main character.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=63–64}}  By the end of the decade, [[Pantheon Books]] had begun co-publishing Raw Books' output, and [[Penguin Books]] had picked up publishing of ''Raw'' itself.  The three issues of the second volume of ''Raw'' came in a smaller, longer format with a changed emphasis on narrative rather than graphics.{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=78}}

Mouly divided her time between publishing and parenthood following the birth of daughter [[Nadja Spiegelman|Nadja]] in 1987.  Researching books for Sue Coe motivated her to take up science courses at [[Hunter College]], perhaps toward a neuroscience degree.  She abandoned this plan in 1991 when she gave birth to son Dashiell.{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=78}}  In 1991, Mouly and Spiegelman published the final issue of ''Raw'', which was no longer a small, hands-on operation, nor was it something they still thought necessary, as the artists then had a range of publishing outlets that had not existed when ''Raw'' first saw the light of day.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=77–78}}

[[Tina Brown]] became the editor of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine in 1992, and was intent on changing it from the stolid, conservative image left it by [[William Shawn]]'s long editorship.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=9–11}}  Her cover choices provoked controversy—in particular, one by Spiegelman for the 1993 Valentine's Day issue{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=100–102}} of a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] man kissing an African-American woman.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=9–11}}  Writer [[Lawrence Weschler]] recommended Brown consider Mouly for the art editor position;{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=11}} Mouly and Brown met the following March.{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=9}}  Mouly had reservations about the magazine's reputation for staidness and Brown's politics,{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=11}} but was taken with Brown on a personal level, whom she described as "charismatic, quick-witted, {{interp|and}} full of energy".{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=12}}  Mouly proposed the magazine return to its roots by having artists as featured contributors, an increase in the visuals in the magazine, such as photographs and more illustrations,{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=12–13}} and covers in the topical style they had had under the magazine's founder [[Harold Ross]].{{sfn|Somaiya|2014}}  Brown accepted.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=12–13}}  Mouly brought a large number of cartoonists and artists to the periodical's interiors, including ''Raw'' contributors such as Coe, Crumb, [[Lorenzo Mattotti]], and [[Chris Ware]].{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=104}}  The magazine's circulation doubled during Mouly's time there.{{sfn|Chong|2013}}  In 2012 Mouly and daughter Nadja edited a collection of rejected ''New Yorker'' covers called ''Blown Covers'', made up of cover sketches and covers that were deemed too risqué for the magazine.{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=120}}

Their response was an all-black cover to ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s subsequent issue.]]

From their SoHo loft ten blocks away, on September 11, 2001, Mouly and Spiegelman witnessed the first plane of the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]] crash into the North Tower of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]].  Four blocks from the towers, daughter Nadja attended [[Stuyvesant High School]].  After collecting her, and son Dashiell from the [[United Nations International School]] further away, they returned home to telephone messages urging Mouly to get to the ''New Yorker'' offices to get to work on a 9-11-themed cover.{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=98}}  Mouly put together a cover in two black inks of different density—a black cover overlaid with a black silhouette of the two towers.  Mouly gave credit for the cover to Spiegelman, who had suggested the silhouette to Mouly's idea of an all-black cover.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=98–99}}

After becoming parents, Mouly and Spiegelman realized how difficult it was at the end of the 20th century to find comics in English appropriate for children.{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=114}}  In 2000{{sfn|Kingston|2013}} Mouly responded with the Raw Junior imprint, beginning with the anthology series ''[[Little Lit]]'', with a roster of cartoonists from ''Raw'', as well as children's book artists and writers such as [[Maurice Sendak]], [[Lemony Snicket]], and [[Barbara McClintock]].  Mouly researched the role comics could play in promoting literacy in young children, and encouraged publishers to publish comics for children.{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=115}}  Disappointed by publishers' lack of response, from 2008 she self-published a line of easy readers called [[Toon Books]], by artists such as Spiegelman, [[Renée French]], and [[Rutu Modan]], and promotes the books to teachers and librarians for their educational value.{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=116}}  The imprint provides support materials for teachers tied into the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]].  In 2014 Toon Books launched an imprint called Toon Graphics aimed at readers eight and up.{{sfn|Alverson|2014}}

==Recognition==

Mouly has had a deep impact on the publishing practices of the comics world, though her name is not well known due to the behind-the-scenes nature of her work and the prominence of her [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning husband.  To Jeet Heer, sexism has also played a role in minimizing the acknowledgement she receives.{{sfn|Kingston|2013}}  In 2013, [[Drawn and Quarterly]] associate publisher [[Peggy Burns]] called Mouly "one of the most influential people in comics for 30 years".{{sfn|Kingston|2013}}  In 2011, the French government recognized Mouly in 2011 as a Knight of the [[Legion of Honour]], as her father had been,{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=120}} and the [[Society of Illustrators]] bestowed on her the Richard Gangel Art Director Award.{{sfn|Society of Illustrators|2013|p=79}}  At the ninth Carle Honors Awards in 2014 the [[Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art]] granted Mouly the Bridge award for promoting children's literature.{{sfn|Staino|2014}}  Comics critic and historian [[Jeet Heer]] published a biographer of Mouly in 2013 titled ''In Love with Art: Françoise Mouly's Adventures in Comics with Art Spiegelman''.{{sfn|Acheson|2014}}  Mouly's daughter Nadja interviewed her and her Mouly's mother Josée for the memoir ''I'm Supposed to Protect You from All This''.{{sfn|Gordon|2016}} In 2015, Mouly was the recipient of Smithsonian Magazine's American Ingenuity Award for Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2015 American Ingenuity Award Winners |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/ingenuity/ceremonies/2015-winners/ |website=Smithsonian Magazine |publisher=Smithsonian |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gandhari''''' ({{Lang-sa|गांधारी, lit. A girl from Gandhara}}) is a prominent character in the [[Hindu]] epic the ''[[Mahabharata]]''. She was a princess of [[Gandhara]] and the wife of [[Dhritrashtra]], the blind king of [[Hastinapura]], and the mother of a hundred sons, the [[Kaurava]]s.

As a [[Pathivratha|pativratha]] (devoted wife) without parallel, Gandhari is regarded as an epitome of virtue, and is among the most respected moral forces in the epic. She was not only married to a blind man, but at the time of her wedding, she resolved to spend the remainder of her life as a blind woman herself, in order to share the debility and pain of her husband. For the rest of her life, she kept a cloth tied to her eyes and thus deprived herself of the power of sight. At certain critical junctures, she gave advice to her husband which was impeccable from a moral standpoint; she never wavered in her adherence to [[dharma]] (righteousness), even to a very bitter end. She was fated to witness the death of all her hundred sons within the space of 18 days, during the Great War between them and their cousins; she also curses the lord Krishna when she was full of sorrow on the death of her 100 children that his vansh (Clan) would also be destroyed in the same manner as that of her. She then retired with her husband to spend her last days in a forest [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]].&lt;ref name="Ganguli"&gt;Ganguli, Kisari Mohan. The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose by Kisari Mohan Ganguli. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
As a maiden, Gandhari was noted for her piety and virtuous nature. Gandhari is regarded as an incarnation of Mati, the goddess of wisdom. She was born on earth as the daughter of Subala, king of [[Gandhara]] and was named 'Gandhari' by her father in honour of his land. She is also referred to in various places in the epic as ''Gandhara-raja-duhita'' (daughter of the Gandhara king), ''Saubaleyi, Saubali, Subalaja, Subala-putri'' and ''Subalatmaja'' (all meaning 'daughter of Subala').{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} She was younger to her brother [[Shakuni]].

== Marriage ==

Gandhari's marriage was arranged to [[Dhritarashtra]], the eldest prince of the [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]] kingdom, a region in [[Delhi]] and [[Haryana]] region. The ''Mahabharata'' depicted her as a beautiful and virtuous woman and a very dedicated wife. Their marriage was arranged by [[Bhishma]]. When she found out that her would-be husband was born blind, she decided to blindfold herself in order to be like her husband. What went through the young girl's mind when she found out that she was to marry a blind man is not depicted in the epic. Popular narration said that the act of blindfolding herself was a sign of dedication and love. On the contrary, [[Irawati Karve]] and many modern scholars debated that the act of blindfolding was an act of protest against [[Bhishma]], as he intimidated her father into giving away her hand in marriage to the blind prince of Hastinapur.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irawati Karve]], [[Yuganta: The End of an Epoch]], Chapter:3&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some folklore and many modern versions of the [[Mahabharata]] depict her marriage as a major reason for the story's central conflict. Her brother, [[Shakuni]], was enraged that Hastinapur, already having humiliated Gandhar in a war of conquest where all of Shakuni's brothers were killed, would offer for his prized sister a blind man. Shakuni swore to destroy the Kuru dynasty and played an instrumental role in fueling the flames of conflict between the cousins.

== Pregnancy and birth of her children ==

[[Vyasa|Veda Vyasa]] is impressed with Gandhari's devotion to her husband and gives her a boon to have 100 hundred sons. She gets pregnant but carries the child for an unusually long period. Later, when she hears that [[Kunti]] (queen of king [[Pandu]], younger brother of Dhritharashtra) has given birth to the eldest of the [[Pandavas]], she pounds on her stomach in frustration and helplessness only to result in birth to a grey mass and not her sons. Veda Vyasa divides this into 100 parts and stores them in earthen pots to incubate. First to be born among these is [[Duryodhana]], followed by 98 brothers and one sister, [[Dushala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02067.htm |title=The Mahabharata, Book : Adi Parva:Sambhava Parva : Section:CXV|publisher=Sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a popular retelling, it is said that Gandhari birthed 100 'children' - 99 sons, among who Duryodhana was the oldest and [[Dushala]] being the only girl. The 101st boy was not Gandhari's, but of a maid with who Dhritarashtra had coitus out of frustration on Gandhari as she was 'delaying' the birth of his sons. He was named Yuyutsu and grew up alongside his [[Kaurava]] brothers.

During the birth of her first son [[Duryodhana]], many ill omen occur, worrying [[Vyasa]], [[Bhishma]] and [[Vidura]]. They foresee that this child might cause great destruction to their kingdom, and advise to either release him onto the waters of river [[Ganga]] or kill him. But Dhritarashtra and Gandhari reject the idea.

== Later life and death ==
[[File:Kunti Gandhari Dhrtarashtra.jpg|thumb|left|Kunti leading Dhritarashtra and Gandhari as she goes to the forest in exile]]

Some folk fore narrate that Gandhari made a single exception to her blindfolded state, when she removed her blindfold to see her eldest son Duryodhana. She poured all her power into her son's body in one glance, rendering Duryodhana's entire body, except his [[loins]], as strong as [[thunderbolt]]. [[Krishna]] foiled Gandhari's plan by asking Duryodhana to cover up his privates before meeting his mother. On their decisive encounter on the eighteenth day of the Kurukshetra battle, [[Bhima]] smashed Duryodhana's thighs, a move both literally and figuratively below the belt. This story is not mentioned in the original version of the ''Mahabharata'' which was written by Veda Vyasa. As per Vyasa's ''Mahabharata'', Duryodhana, while fighting against Bhima, displayed his superior mace skills, due to which Bhima could not defeat him and had to break rules to kill him.

All of Gandhari's sons were killed in the war against their cousins, the [[Pandavas]], at [[Kurukshetra]], specifically at the hands of [[Bhima]]. Upon hearing the news, it is said that through a small gap in the blindfold, her gaze fell on Yudhishthira's toe. His clean toe was charred black due to her wrath and power. When she heard the news of the death of all the sons of Pandavas ([[Upapandavas]]), she embraced the Pandavas and consoled them for their losses. Later her wrath turned to Krishna for allowing all this destruction to happen.&lt;ref name=kmg&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mahabharataofkri06royp#page/n3/mode/2up Stri Parva] The Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, Published by P.C. Roy (1889)&lt;/ref&gt; She cursed that he, his city and all his subjects would be destroyed. Krishna accept the curse. Her curse took its course 36 years after the great war when Yadu dynasty perished after a fight broke out between [[Yadavas]] at a festival. Lord Krishna ascended to his heavenly abode after living for 126 years. The golden city of [[Dwarka]] drowned exactly seven days after his disappearance. Gandhari along with her husband Dhritarashtra, brother-in-law Vidura and sister-in-law Kunti, left Hastinapur about 15 years after the war to seek penance. She is said to have died in the [[Himalayas]] in a forest fire along with Vidura and Kunti and attained [[moksha]].
&lt;ref name="Tears of Gandhari"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pattanaik|first1=Devdutt|title=Tears of Gandhari|url=http://devdutt.com/articles/indian-mythology/mahabharata/tears-of-gandhari.html|website=Devdutt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayal in the ''Mahabharata''==
[[File:Gandhari reprimands Duryodhana.jpg|thumb|150px|Gandhari reprimands Duryodhana]]
The ''Mahabharata'' attributes high moral standards to Gandhari, although her sons are portrayed as villains. She repeatedly exhorted her sons to follow [[dharma]] and make peace with the Pandavas. Gandhari fostered a big-little sister relationship with Kunti. Famously, when Duryodhana would ask for her blessing of victory during the Kurukshetra war, Gandhari would only say "may victory find the side of righteousness". Gandhari's major flaw was her love for her sons, especially her first born, Duryodhana, which often blinded her to his flaws.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Legacy==

In Hebbya village, Nanjangud, Mysore, India there is a temple called [[Gāndhārī temple]]  dedicated to her.This temple honours her devotion and loyalty as she epitomized the goodness of a mother and a loving wife. The foundation stone of the temple was laid on June 19, 2008. It was expected to cost Rs 2.5 crore (INR 25 million). 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gandhari temple: a testimony to loyalty and womanhood|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/06/20/stories/2008062057760200.htm|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rabindranath Tagore]] wrote a Bengali poetic play about her, named ''Gandharir Abedon'' (Bangla: গান্ধারীর আবেদন, Translation:Supplication of Gandhari). The play portray Gandhari, her husband [[Dhritarashtra]] and their son [[Duryodhana]] as central character.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchayita by Rabindranath Tagore&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gangaji''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|ŋ|ɡ|ə|dʒ|i}} {{respell|GAHNG|gə-jee}}; born Texas, 1942) is an American born spiritual teacher and author. She lives in [[Ashland, Oregon]], with her husband, fellow spiritual teacher [[Eli Jaxon-Bear]].

==Early life==
Gangaji was born '''Merle Antoinette Roberson''' (Toni) in Texas on June 11, 1942, and grew up in Mississippi. After graduating from the [[University of Mississippi]] she and her young family moved to [[San Francisco]]. After a divorce&lt;ref name="The End of All Excuses"&gt;[http://www.gangaji.org/index.php?modules=content&amp;op=all_excuses “The End of All Excuses”] by Gangaji.&lt;/ref&gt; she sought to change her life via political activism and spiritual practice. She took buddhist [[Bodhisattva]] vows, practiced [[Zazen|Zen]] and [[Vipassana]] meditation, helped in a Tibetan-style meditation center, and began a career as an [[acupuncturist]] in the [[San Francisco Bay area]].
Unfulfilled by her seemingly successful life, in 1989 she and [[Eli Jaxon-Bear]] moved to [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;Gangaji; Roslyn Moore. ''Just Like You, An Autobiography'', Do Publishing 2003 {{ISBN|0-9646999-2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Papaji==
At this time she met [[Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)|Andrew Cohen]], a spiritual teacher and student of Sri [[H.W.L. Poonja]], also known as Papaji. Impressed by Cohen’s "enormous confidence", she returned to California to sit with him for two months.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, Holly. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=W-kDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;rview=1&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Conversation with Gangaji]", Yoga Journal, May-Jun 1994, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, Eli, who had become her second husband, met Papaji in India. Struck by the letters she received from Eli, Gangaji herself traveled to Lucknow, India to meet Papaji in 1990. In her autobiography ''Just Like You'' she wrote, "The extraordinary event in this life was that I met Papaji. Until then I looked everywhere for the transcendental or the extraordinary, but after meeting Papaji I began to find the extraordinary in every moment."&lt;ref&gt;Roslyn Moore, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; Papaji gave her the name Gangaji, and asked her to share what she had directly realized with others.&lt;ref name="The End of All Excuses"/&gt;

==Teaching==
Gangaji currently writes and tours as a teacher. She holds that the truth of who you are is already free and at peace, which can be realized simply by ending one’s search.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I invite people to just stop and be still. And in that you discover who you are, because once you discover who you are, you can stop fragmenting into pieces. I know that in any one day there are moments where there is nothing going on, but we link up what is happening from thought to thought without any space. We overlook the spaciousness that it is all happening in."&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Ed and Deb (2009), p.268&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gangaji uses a personal form of inquiry to aid in the realization of 'direct experience':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I use inquiry as a way of getting the mind to turn inward to the silence. It could be the question, "Who am I?" Or it could be "What am I avoiding in this moment?" Or, "Where is silence?" "What is needed in this moment, right in this very moment, what is needed for true peace?" "What is needed if this was my last moment on earth?" Rather than sending the mind outward to gather information or experiences, it is really sending the mind inward to question our basic assumption of who we think we are."&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Ed and Deb (2009), p.285&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In facing strong emotions such as fear and anger, or in dealing with traumas which keep people locked in personal misery and unable to experience freedom, Gangaji teaches "direct experience," or meeting whatever emotion is present. For example, she says, "Fear is about survival. When you drop under that and experience the fear without trying to change it, just letting it be, then it becomes still. When you open your heart to fear, rather than trying to fight it or deny it or even overcome it, then you find it is just energy." &lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Ed and Deb (2009), p.94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gangaji Foundation==
Since 1993 Gangaji’s work has been supported by The Gangaji Foundation, a non-profit headquartered in [[Ashland, Oregon]]. Its mission statement states: "The Gangaji Foundation serves the truth of universal consciousness, and the potential for the individual and collective recognition of peace inherent in the core of all being. It is the purpose of the Gangaji Foundation to forthrightly and respectfully present the teaching and transmission of Gangaji.

The Gangaji Foundation produces events, publishes books and videos, hosts a website and runs several outreach programs including a prison program.

==Relationship==
In October 2005, Gangaji's husband, [[Eli Jaxon-Bear]], admitted to Gangaji that he had a three-year affair with an adult female student and executive director of his organization, the Leela Foundation.&lt;ref name="tidings"/&gt; After a brief separation, Gangaji and her husband reconciled their marriage in December 2005. At the student’s request, the information about the affair was not made public at that time.&lt;ref name="Denempont"/&gt; In January 2006, Gangaji and her husband merged their foundations, continuing to teach together and separately.

In October 2006, Jaxon-Bear disclosed his extramarital relationship to the Gangaji Foundation's board of directors and staff. Barbara Denempont, executive director of the Gangaji Foundation, explained the situation in an open letter approved by the board. "What was initially seen as a matter between two adults is now recognized to be a betrayal of the teacher/student relationship and an abuse of power."&lt;ref name="Denempont"/&gt; She added: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"The repercussions of this betrayal are reverberating in ways that were never imagined, but are very painful. The deepest truths do not excuse or justify our failures and betrayals as human beings. Gratefully though, without minimizing or spiritualizing the damage done, love remains and sustains all. It is only in love that we can truly meet the pain that comes with being human. Ever more so, we can commit ourselves to the compassion that love provides and to tell the truth more clearly and honestly to others and ourselves."&lt;ref name="Denempont"&gt;Denempont, Barbara. [https://www.webcitation.org/62L2Rah24?url=http://gangaji.tribe.net/thread/e7b6401a-94e3-4f1c-89f2-9a5b18512aa0 Letter from Boards of Leela &amp; Gangaji Foundations], The Gangaji Foundation, October 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For a time Jaxon-Bear stopped teaching. Both he and the Gangaji Foundation held open meetings with the stated purpose to heal whatever wounds may have been experienced in their spiritual community.&lt;ref name="tidings"&gt;[http://www.dailytidings.com/2006/1014/stories/1014_gangaji.php Ashland Daily Tidings : Spiritual leaders' split leads to consolidation of groups :: October 14, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516202057/http://www.dailytidings.com/2006/1014/stories/1014_gangaji.php |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition Gangaji, and eventually she and her husband, held retreats on the subjects of disillusionment, betrayal, and relationship.

In 2007 Jaxon-Bear was diagnosed with [[multiple myeloma]], a severe form of blood cancer. After undergoing extensive treatment he made a partial recovery. In January 2008, he reestablished the Leela Foundation and resumed teaching on his own and with Gangaji.

==History==

Scholars believe that Gonds ruled in [[Gondwana (India)|Gondwana]], now in eastern Madhya Pradesh and western Odisha, between the 13th and 19th centuries AD. Muslim writers described a rise of Gond state after the 14th century.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Gonds ruled in four kingdoms ([[Garha Kingdom|Garha-Mandla]], Deogarh, Chanda, and Kherla) in central India between the 16th and 18th centuries. They built number of forts, palaces, temples, tanks and lakes during the rule of the Gonds dynasty. The Gondwana kingdom survived until the late 16th century. They also gained control over the Malwa after the decline of the Mughals followed by the Marathas in 1690.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The Maratha power swept into Gondland in the 1740s. The Marathas overthrew the Gond Rajas (princes) and seized most of their territory, while Some Gond zamindaris (estates) survived until recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Concept of Race in South Asia |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Delhi |year=1995 |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Robb |first=Crispin |last=Bates |chapter=Race, Caste and Tribe in Central India: the early origins of Indian ...anthropomorphize |isbn=978-0-19-563767-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwNkQgAACAAJ |page=233 |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and religion==
The ancient Gonds were familiar with many astronomical concepts,&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1306/1306.2416.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; having their own local terms for the Sun, Moon, constellations and Milky Way, with much of their knowledge forming the basis for their time-keeping and calendrical activities. Not only the Gonds, but also the [[Banjara]]s and [[Kolam people|Kolams]] are known to have possessed astronomical knowledge.&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"&gt;https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1406/1406.3044.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Their typical reaction to death has been described as one of anger because they believe it is caused by magical demons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Santrock|first=John W.|title=Life-Span Development|date=2017|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=9781259254833|page=598|edition=16th International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their religion was based on worship of clan and village deities, as well as ancestor worship and totems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Gond|title=Gond {{!}} people|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Gonds worship [[Ravana]], whom they consider to be the tenth ''dharmaguru'' of their people and the ancestor-king of one of their four lineages. They also worship Kupar Lingo as their supreme deity and their ancestor before Ravana. On [[Dussehra]], the Gondi inhabitants of [[Paraswadi]] carry an image of Ravana riding an elephant in a procession to worship him, and protest the burning of Ravana's effigies. Their worship of Ravana is also a way to resist pressure from Christian missionaries and right-wing Hindu groups and preserve their own culture. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/asuras-no-just-indians/291677 Asuras?

'''Great King''' and the equivalent in many languages is a semantic title for historical titles of [[monarch]]s, suggesting an elevated status among the host of [[monarch|King]]s and [[Prince]]s. This title is most usually associated with the [[shahanshah]] (Shah of shahs, i.e. king of kings, indeed translated in Greek ''Basileus tōn basileōn'', later adopted by the Byzantine emperors) of [[Persia]] under the [[Achaemenid dynasty]] whose vast empire in [[Asia]] lasted for 200 years up to the year 330 BC, and later adopted by successors of the [[Achaemenid]] empire whose monarchial names were also succeeded by "the Great". In comparison, [[High King]] was used by ancient rulers in Britain, Scotland and Ireland, as well as Greece.

In the 2nd Millennium BCE Near East, there was a tradition of reciprocally using such addresses between powers as a way of diplomatically recognizing each other as an equal. Only the kings of countries who were not subject to any other king and powerful enough to draw the respect from their adversaries were allowed to use the title of Great King. Those were the kings of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Yamhad]], [[Hittite Empire|Hatti]], [[Babylonia]], [[Mitanni]] (until its demise in the 14th century), [[Assyria]] (only after the demise of Mitanni), and for a brief time [[Mycenae|Myceneans]]. Great Kings referred to each other as brothers and often established close relationships by means of marriages and frequent gift exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Raymond |last2=Westbrook |first2=Raymond (eds.) |title=Amarna Diplomacy |publisher=Johns Hopkins |year=1999 |isbn=0801861993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letters exchanged between these rulers, several of which has been recovered especially in [[Amarna letters|Amarna]] and [[Hittites|Hittite]] archives, provide details of this diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |first=Bryce |last=Trevor |year=1992 |title=Letters of the Great Kings of the Ancient Near East |publisher=Routledge |isbn=041525857X}}; for [[Amarna letters]] see {{cite book |first=Moran |last=William L. |year=1992 |title=The Amarna Letters |publisher=Johns Hopkins |isbn=0801842514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of [[Maharaja]] ("Great Raja", great King and Prince, in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Hindi]]) on the [[India]]n subcontinent, originally reserved for the regional hegemon such as the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]], is a striking example how such a lofty style of this or an alternative model can get caught in a cycle of devalution by "title inflation" as ever more, mostly less powerful, rulers adopt the style. This is often followed by the emergence of one or more new, more exclusive and prestigious styles, as in this case ''[[Maharajadhiraja]]'' ("Great King of Kings"). The Turkic-Mongol title [[Khan (title)|Khan]] also came to be 'augmented' to tiles like Chagan or Hakan, meaning 'Khan of khans', i.e. equivalent to king of kings.

The aforementioned Indian style ''Maharajadhiraja'' is also an example of an alternative semantic title for similar 'higher' royal styles such as [[King of Kings]]. Alternatively, a more idiomatic style may develop into an equally prestigious tradition of titles, because of the shining example of the original &amp;ndash; thus various styles of [[Emperor]]s trace back to the Roman ''[[Imperator]]'' (strictly speaking a republican military honorific), the family surname [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] (turned into an imperial title since [[Diocletian]]'s [[Tetrarchy]]).

As the conventional use of "King" and its equivalents to render various other monarchical styles illustrates, there are many roughly equivalent styles, each of which may spawn a "Great ''X''" variant, either unique or becoming a rank in a corresponding tradition; in this context "Grand" is equivalent to "Great" and sometimes interchangeable if convention does not firmly prescribe one of the two. Examples include [[Grand duke]] and German ''[[Grosswojwod]]''.

'''Hans Schwarz''', (29 December 1922 – 28 May 2003) was a prolific Austrian artist, who spent most of his life in Britain and was notable for his portrait painting, several examples of which are held by the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in London. Schwarz was [[Jewish]] and was forced to leave Austria in 1938 when the Nazis took over and he went into exile in Britain.&lt;ref name=APayne&gt;{{cite web |author=Alice Payne|url=http://www.artuk.org/discover/stories/five-artists-who-fled-their-country-of-origin/ |title=Five artists who fled their country of origin|date=30 August 2016|accessdate=5 September 2016|work=Art UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Schwarz was born in Vienna to Jewish parents. His mother died when he was 12 years old, two years before he entered art school in Vienna. With the [[Anschluss]], in 1938, Schwarz was forced to abandon his studies. Shortly, afterwards he left Austria aboard a [[Kindertransport]] and made his way to England. His father, a bank clerk, failed to escape Vienna and later died in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=SFenwick&gt;{{cite web |author=Simon Fenwick|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/hans-schwarz-36602.html|title=Obituary:Hans Schwarz|date=6 June 2003|accessdate=5 September 2016|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving in England, the young Schwarz worked as a labourer for a year at [[Bournville]] before he was interned on the [[Isle of Man]] as an [[enemy alien]]. When he was released from internment in 1941, Schwarz enrolled at the [[Birmingham College of Art]] and studied there until 1943.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol2"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buckman|publisher=Art Dictionaries Ltd|year=1998|title=Artists in Britain Since 1945 Vol 2, M to Z |ISBN=0 95326 095 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarz then spent two years working in a commercial art studio before, when the Second World War ended, establishing himself as a freelance commercial illustrator.&lt;ref name=SFenwick/&gt; He completed several murals for public buildings and also some work for the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]].&lt;ref name=Estate&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://hansschwarz.co.uk/biography/|title=Biography: Hans Schwarz|year=2014|accessdate=6 September 2016|work=hansschwarz.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; For almost twenty years Schwarz worked for several high-profile clients, including [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], the Post Office and [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]], until in 1964 he decided to concentrate full-time on his painting and sculpture.&lt;ref name=CourtG&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://www.courtgallery.com/artists/Schwarz.html|title=Hans Schwarz 1922-2003|year=|accessdate=6 September 2016|work=The Court Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 Schwarz and his family moved to Somerset, from [[Hampstead]], where he expanded the range of his work, painting more landscapes, undertaking more sculptures and using watercolours for the first time.&lt;ref name=Estate/&gt;
 
From 1970 until his death, Schwarz lived and worked in [[Greenwich]] and produced some of his finest work at his studio there. In 1984 the National Portrait Gallery commissioned Schwarz to produce a group portrait of several trade union leaders.&lt;ref name=M1gall&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://www.m1fineart.com/news/?post_id=33
|title=Hans Schwarz (1922-2003) - The Greenwich Years|date=11 September 2015|accessdate=6 September 2016|work=M1 Fine Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting picture of [[Joe Gormley (trade unionist)|Joe Gormley]], [[Sidney Weighell|Sid Weighell]] and [[Thomas Jackson (trade unionist)|Tom Jackson]] in [[Trafalgar Square]] with pigeons flying around them is possibly his best known work. Other notable portraits by Schwarz from this period include depictions of [[Janet Suzman]], [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] and the poet [[Ivor Cutler]].&lt;ref name=M1gall/&gt; From Greenwich, Schwarz painted several urban landscapes often featuring the streets in his immediate vicinity but also [[Canary Wharf]] and the [[Isle of Dogs]]. Schwarz wrote several books on artistic techniques and, with his wife Lena, a book on the [[Halesowen]] district of the West Midlands.&lt;ref name=Estate/&gt;

In 1981, Schwarz won the [[Hunting Art Prize]] for a watercolour painting. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s he held a number of well-received exhibitions at commercial galleries. These included a series at the Thackeray Gallery and individual shows at the Compton Gallery in 1983, the [[Ben Uri Gallery]] in 1985, the Woodlands Art Gallery in 1991, the [[Sternberg Centre]] in 1992 and the New Academy Gallery in both 1995 and 2001. The auction house [[Bonhams]] sold the contents of his studio in 2004.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol2"/&gt;

[[File:Mishkan5 big.jpg|thumb|A model of the Tabernacle showing the holy place, and behind it the Holy of Holies]]

The '''Holy of Holies''' ([[Tiberian Hebrew]]: {{Hebrew|קֹדֶשׁ הַקֳּדָשִׁים}} ''Qṓḏeš HaQŏḏāšîm'') is a term in the [[Hebrew Bible]] which refers to the inner sanctuary of the [[Tabernacle]] where God's presence appeared.  The Ark according to Hebrew Scripture contained the [[Ten Commandments]], which were given by God to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. It is thought to be located under the [[Dome of the Rock]]. No archaeological evidence confirms the location.

The area was defined by four pillars which held up the veil of the covering under which the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was held above the floor. King Solomon built the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was kept during the [[First Temple]].

==Hebrew terminology and translation==

The construction "Holy of Holies" is a literal translation of a Hebrew idiom which is intended to express a [[superlative]]. Examples of similar constructions are "servant of servants" (Gen 9:25), "Sabbath of sabbaths" (Ex 31:15), "God of gods" (Deut 10:17), "Vanity of vanities" (Eccl 1:2), "Song of songs" (Song of Songs 1:1), "king of kings" (Ezra 7:12), etc.

In the [[Authorized King James Version]], "Holy of Holies" is always translated as "Most Holy Place". This is in keeping with the intention of the Hebrew idiom to express the utmost degree of holiness. The King James Version of the Bible has been in existence for over four hundred years. For most of that time, it was a primary reference in much of the English speaking world for information about Judaism. Thus, the name "Most Holy Place" was used to refer to the "Holy of Holies" in many English documents.
[[File:Holman The Holy of Holies.jpg|thumbnail|right|Depiction of a Jewish [[High Priest]] wearing [[Hoshen]] and [[Ephod]] included as an illustration in a Christian Bible; the Holy of Holies is in the background (1890, Holman Bible)]]
A related term is the ''[[debir]]'' ({{Hebrew|דְּבִיר}}) transliterated in the [[Septuagint]] (the Greek translation as ''dabir'' ({{lang|grc|δαβιρ}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H1687&amp;t=KJV Strong's Concordance, Gesenius ''devir'']&lt;/ref&gt; which either means the back (i.e. western) part of the Sanctuary,&lt;ref&gt;The Solomonic Debir according to the Hebrew Text of I Kings 6 J. Ouellette - [[Journal of Biblical Literature]], 1970 - JSTOR "The immediate implication of this reading is that the holy of holies was built "from within the debir," that is ... The LXX simply transliterates dabir, while the Vulgate has "oraculum", thus suggesting a derivation from dbr "to speak."&lt;/ref&gt; or derives from the verb stem D-V-R, "to speak", justifying the translation in the Latin Vulgate as ''oraculum'', from which the traditional English translation "oracle" (KJV, 1611) derives.&lt;ref&gt;The Damaged "blueprints" of the Temple of Solomon. L. Waterman - [[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]], 1943 - JSTOR "The term "holy of holies" has long been accepted as a later descriptive term applied to the debir. The Hebrew word debir, rendered "oracle" in the versions, is a mistranslation based on a false etymology. The term itself signifies only the back or part behind, for example."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jerus-n4i.jpg|right|thumb|Model of the Second Temple]]
===Tabernacle===
The Holy of Holies was covered by a [[veil]], and no one was allowed to enter except the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]], and even he could only enter once a year on [[Yom Kippur]] (the day of atonement), to offer the blood of sacrifice and [[incense]] before the [[mercy seat]]. The Bible reports that in the wilderness, on the day that the [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|tabernacle]] was first raised up, the cloud of the Lord covered the tabernacle ({{Bibleverse|Exodus|40:33-40:34}}). There are other times that this was recorded, and instructions were given that the Lord would appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat (''kapporet''), and at that time the priests should not enter into the tabernacle (Leviticus 16:2). According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Holy of Holies contained the [[Ark of the Covenant]] with representation of [[Cherub]]im. Upon completion of the dedication of the Tabernacle, the Voice of God spoke to Moses "from between the Cherubim" ({{Bibleverse|Numbers|7:89}}).

The area could be entered only by the [[High Priest (Judaism)|High Priest]] on [[Yom Kippur]] after sanctifying himself.

===Solomon's Temple===
The Holy of Holies, the [[Most sacred sites|most sacred site]] in [[Judaism]], is the inner sanctuary within the [[Tabernacle]] and [[Temple in Jerusalem]] when [[Solomon's Temple]] and the [[Second Temple]] were standing. The Holy of Holies was located in the westernmost end of the Temple building, being a perfect cube: 20 [[cubit]]s by 20 cubits by 20 cubits. The inside was in total darkness and contained the [[Ark of the Covenant]], gilded inside and out, in which was placed the [[Tablets of stone|Tablets of the Covenant]]. According to [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 9:4 in the [[New Testament]], [[Aaron's rod]] and a pot of [[manna]] were also in the ark. The Ark was covered with a lid made of pure gold, known as the "[[mercy seat]]" ({{bibleverse|Exodus|37:6}})  which was covered by the beaten gold cherubim wings. Creating the space for the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Second Temple===
When the Temple was rebuilt after the [[Babylonian captivity]], the Ark was no longer present in the Holy of Holies; instead, a portion of the floor was raised slightly to indicate the place where it had stood. [[Josephus]] records that [[Pompey]] profaned the Temple by insisting on entering the Holy of Holies in 63 BCE.

The Holy of Holies was entered once a year by the High Priest on the [[Day of Atonement]], to sprinkle the blood of sacrificial animals (a bull offered as atonement for the Priest and his household, and a goat offered as atonement for the people) and offer incense upon the [[Ark of the Covenant]] and the [[mercy seat]] which sat on top of the ark in the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] (the [[Second Temple]] had no ark and the blood was sprinkled where the Ark would have been and the incense was left on the [[Foundation Stone]]). The animal was sacrificed on the [[Brazen Altar]] and the blood was carried into the most holy place. The golden [[censer]]s were also found in the Most Holy Place.

===Instructions for the Tabernacle===
According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], in order that [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] may dwell among the Israelites, [[tetragrammaton|God]] gave Moses instructions for erecting a [[sanctuary]]. The directions provide for:
# A [[Ark of the Covenant|wooden ark]], [[gold|gilded]] inside and outside, for the [[Tablets of stone|Tablets of the Covenant]], with a pure gold cover as the "[[mercy seat]]" for the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]];
# A gilt table for the "[[showbread|Table of Showbread]]", on which loaves of bread were arranged;
# A golden [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], lampstand of 7 oil lamps for a [[light]] never to be extinguished;
# The dwelling, including the curtains for the roof, the walls made of boards resting on [[silver]] feet and held together by [[wood]]en [[Screw|bolts]], the [[purple]] [[curtain]] veiling the Holy of Holies, the table and [[candlestick]], and the outer curtain;
# A [[Altar (Bible)|sacrificial altar]] made of [[bronze]]d boards for its ''[[korban]]''/sacrifice;
# The outer court formed by [[column|pillars]] resting on bronze [[pedestal]]s and connected by hooks and crossbars of silver, with embroidered curtains;
# Recipe and preparation of the [[holy anointing oil|oil]] for the Lampstand.

==In ancient Judaism==

The [[Magdala stone]] is thought to be a representation of the Holy of Holies carved before the destruction of the Temple in the year 70.&lt;ref name=Kershner&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kershner|first1=Isabel|title=A Carved Stone Block Upends Assumptions About Ancient Judaism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/world/middleeast/magdala-stone-israel-judaism.html|accessdate=9 December 2015|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Rabbinical Judaism==
[[File:Women praying in the Western Wall tunnels by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Women praying in the tunnel at the closest physical point not under Islamic [[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf|Waqf]] jurisdiction to the Holy of Holies]]

Traditional [[Judaism]] regards the location where the inner sanctuary was originally located, on the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Mount Moriah]], as retaining some or all of its original sanctity for use in a future [[Third Temple]]. The exact location of the Kodesh Hakodashim{{underdiscussion-inline|Duplicate articles with non-English titles}} is a subject of dispute.

Traditional Judaism regards the Holy of Holies as the place where the presence of [[God]] dwells. The [[Talmud]] gives detailed descriptions of Temple architecture and layout. According to the [[Babylonian Talmud]] Tractate [[Yoma]], the Kodesh Hakodashim is located in the center North-South but significantly to the West from an East–West perspective, with all the major courtyards and functional areas lying to its east.

The [[Talmud]] supplies additional details, and describes the ritual performed by the High Priest. During the ritual, the High Priest would pronounce the [[Tetragrammaton]], the only point according to traditional [[Judaism]] that it was pronounced out loud. According to Jewish tradition, the people prostrated themselves fully on the ground when it was said. According to the Talmud, the High Priest's face upon exit from the Holy of Holies was radiant.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

While under normal circumstances, access to the Holy of Holies was restricted to the High Priest and only on [[Yom Kippur]], the Talmud suggests that repair crews were allowed inside as needed but were lowered from the upper portion of the room via enclosures so that they only saw the area they were to work on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Pesachim.pdf Talmud Mas. Pesachim 26a]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Eiruvin.pdf Talmud Mas. Eiruvin 105a]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synagogue architecture===
[[Judaism]] regards the [[Torah ark]], a place in a [[synagogue]] where the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]] are kept, as a miniature Holy of Holies.

===Modern location===
[[File:The rock of the Dome of the Rock Corrected.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Foundation Stone]]'' under the Dome of the Rock, a possible historical location for the Kodesh Hakodashim.]]

At present it is conjectured that it is located under the [[Dome of the Rock]] which stands on the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]], though the exact location of the Most Holy Place is not known with absolute certainty. Most [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] today completely avoid climbing up to Temple Mount, to prevent them from accidentally stepping on the ''Most Holy Place'' or any sanctified areas. A few Orthodox Jewish authorities, following the opinion of the medieval scholar [[Maimonides]], permit Jews to visit parts of the Temple Mount known not to be anywhere near any of the sanctified areas. Orthodox Jewish visitors to the Temple Mount, who come especially from those groups associated with the [[Temple Institute]] and its efforts to rebuild a [[Third Temple|Temple]], seek to conform to the minimal requirements for coming near the Temple, such as immersing in a [[mikvah]] ("collection of water"), not coming during or following [[niddah|menstruation]] or immediately following a [[semen|seminal emission]], not showing their back towards its presumed location, and other strictures.

To avoid religious conflict, Jewish visitors caught praying or bringing ritual objects are usually expelled from the area by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Nadav |last=Shragai

==In apocryphal literature==

According to the ancient [[apocrypha]]l ''[[Lives of the Prophets]]'', after the death of Zechariah Ben Jehoiada, the priests of the Temple could no more, as before, see the apparitions of the [[angels]] of the Lord, nor could make [[divination]]s with the [[Ephod]], nor give responses from the ''[[Debir]]''.

==Christianity==

===New Testament===
The Greek New Testament retains the pre-Christian Septuagint phrase "Holy of the Holies" ''hágion ''([[Singular number|sg]] [[Neuter gender|n]])'' tōn hagíōn'' ({{lang|grc|ἅγιον τῶν ἁγίων}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kWEESjS8bg4C&amp;pg=PA514&amp;lpg=PA514#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%E1%BC%85%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%BD%20%CF%84%E1%BF%B6%CE%BD%20%E1%BC%81%CE%B3%CE%AF%CF%89%CE%BD%22|title=Ezekiel|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; without the definite article as "Holies of Holies" ''hágia ''([[Plural number|pl]] [[neuter gender|n]])'' hagíōn'' ({{lang|grc|ἅγια ἁγίων}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb009.htm|title=NEW ADVENT BIBLE: Hebrews 9|work=newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Hebrews 9:3. In the [[Vulgate]], these are rendered as ''sanctum sanctorum'' and ''sancta sanctorum'', respectively. The Greek language was the common language upon Hellenization of much of the Middle East after the death of Alexander the Great, and the division of his empire among four generals. The Jews of the Diaspora spoke it. The Latin Vulgate of St. Jerome was a faithful translation for Christian Rome.

===Christian traditions===
{{expand section|Seventh-Day Adventists|date=October 2014}}
Certain branches of [[Christianity]], including the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] continue to have a tradition of a Holy of Holies which they regard as a [[Most sacred sites|most sacred site]]. The [[ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]], a permanent canopy over the altar in some churches, once surrounded by curtains at points in the [[liturgy]], symbolizes the Holy of Holies. Some Christian churches, particularly the [[Catholic Church]], consider the [[Church tabernacle]], or its location (often at the rear of the sanctuary), as their symbolic equivalent of the Holy of Holies, due to the storage of consecrated host in that vessel.

====Eastern Orthodox Church====
{{main|iconostasis}}
The Greek phrase refers to the Tabernacle or Temple. The name in [[Greek language|Greek]] for the sanctuary of a church is '''{{lang|grc|Ἱερόν Βῆμα}}''' (''Hieron Vema'', see [[Bema#Christianity]]), in [[Russian language|Russian]] it is called '''Святой Алтарь''' (''Svyatoy Altar'' - literally: "Holy Altar"), and in Romanian it is called ''Sfântul Altar''.

====Ethiopian Orthodox Church====
A [[cognate]] term in [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] is found in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]]: ''Qidduse Qiddusan'', referring to the innermost sanctuary of an Orthodox Christian church, where the [[tabot]] is kept and only clergy may enter. This is also called the "Bete Mekdes. Every Ethiopian Orthodox Church has one, and it is covered with a Curtain. There are Three ways to enter (most of the time) and those three doors are also a way to reveal the Holy Trinity. In the middle there is always an Altar where the Church's [[Tabot]] is kept. There can be as many altars as the number of Tabots."&lt;ref&gt;Stuart C. Munro-Hay, ''Ethiopia, the unknown land: a cultural and historical guide'', (London: I.B.Tauris, 2002). p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malabar Nasrani tradition====
[[File:A Syro Malabar Catholic Church or Nasrani Palli.JPG|thumb|250px|A church of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] in [[Kerala]], [[South India]] still following the [[Jewish Christian]] tradition of keeping the Holy of Holies veiled by a red curtain in the tradition of the [[Ancient Temple of Jerusalem]], much like their [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] counterparts viz. the [[Malankara Jacobite Syriac Orthodox Church]] and the [[Indian Orthodox Church]].]]

The [[Saint Thomas Christians]] (also known as Nasrani or Syrian Christians) from [[Kerala]], [[South India]] still follow much [[Jewish Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref name= "Ross"&gt;Ross, Israel J. (1979). "Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala". ''Asian Music''. 11 (1): 80–98.&lt;/ref&gt; In Nasrani tradition the Holy of Holies is kept veiled for much of the time. The red veil covers the inner altar or the main altar. It is unveiled only during the central part of the main Nasrani ritual. The main ritual of the Saint Thomas Christians is the [[Qurbana]] (derived from the Syriac word "Qurobo" meaning "sacrifice").&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt;

====Roman Catholic Church====

The Latin [[Vulgate]] Bible translates ''Qṓḏeš HaqQŏḏāšîm'' as [[Sanctum sanctorum]] (Ex 26:34). Reproducing in Latin the Hebrew construction, the expression is used as a superlative of the neuter adjective ''sanctum'', to mean "a thing most holy". It is used by Roman Catholics to refer to holy objects beyond the Holy of Holies, and is specifically often used as an alternative name for a [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]], due to the object being a storage chamber for [[Sacramental bread|consecrated host]] and thus where the presence of God is most represented.

The [[Vulgate]] also refers to the Holy of Holies with the plural form ''Sancta sanctorum'' (2 Chr 5:7), arguably a [[synecdoche]] referring to the holy objects hosted there. This form is also used more broadly in Catholic tradition with reference to sanctuaries other than the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. A notable example is for the [[Sancta Sanctorum|Chiesa di San Lorenzo in Palatio ad Sancta Sanctorum]], a chapel in the complex of [[St John Lateran]] in Rome.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
{{Main|Holy of Holies (LDS Church)}}
The [[Salt Lake Temple]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) contains a Holy of Holies wherein the church's [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]]—acting as the Presiding High Priest—enters to fulfill the relationship between the High Priest of Israel and God in accordance with the LDS interpretation of the [[Book of Exodus]] ({{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Exodus|chapter=25|verse=22}}) and Mormon religious texts.

The '''ideal age''' is a recurring theme in various philosophical and sociological deliberations, and part of someone's [[self-concept]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/6807/volumes/v15/NA-15|title=Ideal Age Concepts: an Exploration|last1=Barak|first1=Benny|last2=Stern|first2=Barbara B.|last3=Gould|first3=Stephen J.|work=Advances in Consumer Research|publisher=Association for Consumer Research|volume=15|pages=146–152|date=1988|accessdate=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish authorities in Poland excommunicated Frank and his followers due to his heretical doctrines that included deification of himself as a part of a trinity and other controversial concepts such as neo-[[Carpocratian]] "[[Swinging (sexual practice)#18th century|purification through transgression]]".&lt;ref&gt;Maciejko (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ciekawe.onet.pl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciekawe.onet.pl/historia/jakub-frank-samozwanczy-mesjasz,1,5667237,artykul.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054140/http://ciekawe.onet.pl/historia/jakub-frank-samozwanczy-mesjasz%2C1%2C5667237%2Cartykul.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he intentionally violated moral and religious norms.

Frank arguably created a new religion, now referred to as [[Frankism]], which incorporated some aspects of Christianity into Judaism. The development of Frankism was one of the consequences of the [[Jewish messiah|messianic]] movement of [[Sabbatai Zevi]], the religious mysticism that followed violent persecution and socioeconomic upheavals among the [[history of the Jews in Poland|Jews of Poland]] and [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Ruthenia]].

==Historical background==
There were numerous secret societies of [[Sabbateans]] (followers of Sabbatai Zevi) in [[Kresy|Eastern Poland]] (now [[Ukraine]]),&lt;ref&gt;Map of Kresy at [[:File:Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth 1635.png]]&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in [[Podolia]] and [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] at the end of the seventeenth century.

In expectation of the great Messianic revolution, the members of these societies violated [[Halakha|Jewish laws and custom]]. The mystical cult of the Sabbateans is believed to have included both asceticism and sensuality: some did penance for their sins, subjected themselves to self-inflicted pain, and "mourned for Zion"; others disregarded the strict [[Tzniut|rules of modesty]] required by Judaism, and at times were accused of being licentious. The Polish rabbis attempted to [[Herem (censure)|ban]] the "Sabbatean heresy" at the assembly at [[Lviv]] (Lwów) in 1722, but could not fully succeed, as it was widely popular among the nascent Jewish middle class.

==Early life==

Jacob Frank is believed to have been born as Jakub Lejbowicz&lt;ref name="ciekawe.onet.pl"/&gt; to a Polish-Jewish family in [[Korolivka, Borshchiv Raion|Korołówka]], in [[Podolian Voivodeship|Podolia]] of Eastern [[Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Poland]] (now in [[Ukraine]]), in about 1726. His father was a [[Sabbatean]], and moved to [[Chernivtsi|Czernowitz]], in the Carpathian region of [[Bukovina]] in 1730, where the Sabbatean influence at the time was strong.  While still a schoolboy Frank began to reject the [[Talmud]], and afterward often referred to himself as "a plain" or "untutored man."

As a traveling merchant in textile and precious stones he often visited [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] territories, where he earned the nickname "[[Farangi|Frank]]", a name generally given in the East to Europeans, and lived in the centers of contemporary Sabbateanism: [[Salonica]] and [[Smyrna]].

In the early 1750s, Frank became intimate with the leaders of the Sabbateans. Two followers of Sabbatian leader [[Osman Baba]] (d. 1720) were witnesses at his wedding in 1752. In 1755 he reappeared in Podolia, gathered a group of local adherents, and began to preach the "revelations" which were communicated to him by the [[Dönmeh]] in Salonica. One of these gatherings in [[Landskron]] ended in a scandal, and the rabbis' attention was drawn to the new teachings. Frank was forced to leave Podolia, while his followers were hounded and denounced to the local authorities by the rabbis (1756). At the rabbinical court held in the village of Satanów (today [[Sataniv]] in Ukraine) the Sabbateans were accused of having broken fundamental Jewish laws of morality and modesty.

==The anti-Talmudists==
{{See also|Criticism of the Talmud}}
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
Consequent to these disclosures the congress of rabbis in Brody proclaimed a universal ''[[Herem (censure)|Cherem]]'' (excommunication) against all "impenitent heretics", and made it obligatory upon every pious Jew to seek them out and expose them. The Sabbateans informed [[Mikołaj Dembowski]], the Catholic Bishop of [[Kamieniec Podolski]], Poland, that they rejected the [[Talmud]] and recognized only the sacred book of [[Kabbalah]], the [[Zohar]], which did not contradict the Christian doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. They stated that they regarded the Messiah-Deliverer as one of the embodiments of the three divinities.

The bishop took Frank and his followers (the "Anti-Talmudists", or "Zoharistic Jews") under his protection and in 1757 arranged a religious [[disputation]] between them and the rabbis of the traditionalist community. The Anti-Talmudists presented their theses, which began the intense dispute. The bishop sided in favor of the Frankists and  also ordered the burning of all copies of the Talmud in Poland. 10,000 volumes were destroyed, which was a tremendous loss for the Jewish libraries of that era.

After the death of the bishop, the Sabbateans were subjected to severe persecution by the rabbis, although they succeeded in obtaining an edict from [[Augustus III of Poland]] guaranteeing them safety.

==Declaration of being a successor to Sabbatai Zevi==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
At this critical moment Jacob Frank came to [[Iwania]], proclaimed himself as a direct successor to Sabbatai Zevi and Osman Baba, and assured his adherents that he had received revelations from [[Heaven]]. These revelations called for the conversion of Frank and his followers to the Christian religion, which was to be a visible transition stage to the future "das" or religion to be revealed by Frank. In 1759 negotiations looking toward the conversion of the Frankists to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] were being actively carried on with the higher representatives of the Polish Church; at the same time the Frankists tried to secure another discussion with the rabbis. The Polish primate Łubieński and the papal [[nuncio]] [[Nicholas Serra]] were suspicious of the aspirations of the Frankists, but at the insistence of the administrator of the bishopric of Lemberg, the canon Mikulski, the discussion was arranged. It was held in Lwów, and was presided over by Mikulski. [[Protestant]] missionaries also tried to detour the Frankists to Protestantism, and a handful did in fact join the [[Moravian church]].

==Baptism of the Frankists==

At the discussion in 1759, the rabbis energetically repulsed their opponents. After the discussion the Frankists were requested to demonstrate in practice their adherence to Christianity; Jacob Frank, who had then arrived in Lwów, encouraged his followers to take the decisive step. The baptism of the Frankists was celebrated with great solemnity in the churches of [[Lwów]], with members of the Polish [[szlachta]] (nobility) acting as god-parents. The neophytes adopted the names of their godfathers and godmothers, and ultimately joined their ranks. Frank himself was baptized in Lwów (September 17, 1759) and again in [[Warsaw]] the next day, with [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]] as his godfather. Frank's baptismal name was "Joseph" (''Józef''). In the course of one year more than 500 individuals were converted to Christianity at Lwów, and nearly a thousand in the following year. By 1790, 26,000 Jews were recorded baptised in Poland.&lt;ref name="Mieses"&gt;Mieses&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Frankists continued to be viewed with suspicion due to their strange doctrines. Frank was arrested in Warsaw on February 6, 1760 and delivered to the Church's tribunal on the charge of [[heresy]]. He was convicted of teaching heresy, and imprisoned in the monastery of [[Częstochowa]].&lt;ref name="slownik" /&gt;

==Prison and later days==
[[File:Frank dying.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Jacob Frank on his deathbed, 1791]]

Frank's imprisonment lasted thirteen years, yet it only increased his influence with the sect by surrounding him with the aura of [[martyr]]dom. Many Frankists established themselves near [[Częstochowa]], and kept up constant communication with their "holy master". Frank inspired his followers through mystical speeches and epistles, in which he stated that salvation could be gained only by first adopting the "religion of [[Edom]]" and later adopting a future religion which Frank called ''das'' ("knowledge"). After the first partition of Poland, Frank was released by the Russian general [[Aleksandr Bibikov|Bibikov]], who had occupied Częstochowa, in August 1772. Frank lived in the [[Moravia]]n town of [[Brno]] until 1786, surrounded by a retinue of adherents and pilgrims who came from Poland. His daughter Eve began to play an important role in the sect at this time. Frank kept a force of armed men at his "court". The future czar [[Paul I of Russia]] visited him.

Accompanied by his daughter, Frank repeatedly traveled to [[Vienna]], and succeeded in gaining the favor of the court. [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] regarded him as a disseminator of Christianity among the Jews, and it is even said that [[Joseph II of Austria|Joseph II]] was favorably inclined to the young [[Eve Frank]]. Ultimately Frank was deemed unmanageable and he was obliged to leave [[Austria]]. He moved with his daughter and his retinue to [[Offenbach, Hesse|Offenbach]], in Germany, where he assumed the title of "Baron of Offenbach," and lived as a wealthy nobleman, receiving financial support from his Polish and Moravian followers, who made frequent pilgrimages to Offenbach. On the death of Frank in 1791, Eve became the "holy mistress" and leader of the sect. Her fortunes dwindled in the aftermath of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and she died in Offenbach in 1816.

Some Frankists were active during the [[French Revolution]], such as [[Moses Dobruška]], a son of Frank's Sabbatian cousin in Offenbach Shendl Dobruska. Many of the Frankists saw [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] as a potential Messiah. The Frankists scattered in Poland and Bohemia eventually intermarried into the gentry and middle class. [[Maria Szymanowska]], a piano virtuoso, came from a Frankist family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Album Musical de Maria Szymanowska (review)|url=http://ml.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/83/4/671|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] - Journal of Music and Letters|year=2002|accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wanda Grabowska, the mother of [[Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński]], also descended from Frankists.&lt;ref&gt;(Polish) [http://new-arch.rp.pl/artykul/208220.html Między dwiema trumnami] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125003324/http://new-arch.rp.pl/artykul/208220.html |date=November 25, 2010 }}, [[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]], 9 January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James P. Carse''' is [[Professor Emeritus]] of history and literature of religion at [[New York University]]. His book ''[[Finite and Infinite Games]]'' was widely influential.  Although Dr. Carse may not believe in God, he describes himself as religious "in the sense that I am endlessly fascinated with the unknowability of what it means to be human, to exist at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve |last=Paulson |authorlink= |title=Religion is poetry |url=http://www.salon.com/books/atoms_eden/2008/07/21/james_carse/index1.html |agency= |work= |publisher=[[Salon.com]] |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date=21 July 2008 |accessdate=23 December 2008 |language= |quote= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818182051/http://www.salon.com/books/atoms_eden/2008/07/21/james_carse/index1.html |archivedate=18 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On 18 April 1963, the 17-year-old Asher interviewed [[the Beatles]]&lt;ref name="MilesPage102"&gt;Miles. p102.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London, England]] and began a five-year relationship with [[Paul McCartney]]. In December 1963, McCartney took up residence at Asher's family [[Wimpole Street]] town house and stayed there until the couple moved into McCartney's own home located in [[St John's Wood]] in 1966. McCartney wrote several Beatles songs inspired by her, including "[[And I Love Her]]", "[[You Won't See Me]]", "[[I'm Looking Through You]]", "[[We Can Work It Out]]", and "[[Here, There and Everywhere]]". McCartney and Asher announced on Christmas Day 1967 that they were engaged to marry, and in February and March 1968, Asher accompanied the Beatles and their respective partners to [[Rishikesh]] to attend an advanced [[Transcendental Meditation]] training session with the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]. In mid-1968, Asher returned to London from an acting assignment in [[Bristol]] earlier than expected and discovered McCartney in bed with [[Francie Schwartz]]. A fan who frequently loitered around Paul's [[Cavendish Avenue]] home claims to have witnessed the incident, saying, "... Paul brought this American girl home ... [and a little while later] ... another car turned into Cavendish Avenue—it was Jane. She'd come back ... earlier than she was supposed to. Jane went into the house. A bit later on, she came storming out again and drove away." Shortly after, Margaret Asher drove to Cavendish Avenue to collect her daughter's things.&lt;ref name = "BNorman"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Norman, Philip | authorlink=Philip Norman (author) | title=The True Story of The Beatles | year=1981 | publisher=Hamish Hamilton |location=Long Acre, London | isbn=0-241-10300-2 | page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 1968, Asher announced publicly to the [[BBC]] that her engagement to McCartney had been called off, an announcement that shocked many people, including McCartney himself. At the time of Asher's announcement, McCartney was at his father's home with Schwartz by his side. Though Schwartz confirmed that Asher did see them in bed together, she claims that she was not the sole reason for the breakup, and that the couple were on the verge of separating prior to Asher walking in. Authors [[Hunter Davies]] and [[Barry Miles]], state that the relationship always had several problems, one of them being that McCartney wanted Asher to give up her acting career after they married,  which Asher refused to do. Another prevalent problem in the relationship was McCartney's drug use and frequent womanising. After returning to London from a five-month acting tour of the United States in May 1967, Asher found McCartney to be completely different, confiding in Davies that McCartney had "changed so much. He was on LSD, which I hadn't shared. I was jealous of all the spiritual experiences he'd had with John. There were fifteen people dropping in all day long. The house had changed and was full of stuff I didn't know about."&lt;ref name="JaneAsher"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/people/jane-asher/2/ | title=Jane Asher | publisher=The Beatles Bible}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asher attended the 1970 London premiere of the Beatles' last movie ''[[Let It Be (1970 film)|Let it Be]]'' along with [[John Lennon]]'s former wife [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia]], though none of the former Beatles was in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/1970/05/20/uk-premiere-of-let-it-be/ | title=UK première of Let It Be | publisher=The Beatles Bible}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, she met the illustrator [[Gerald Scarfe]]. Their daughter, Katie, was born in 1974. They married in 1981, and they had two more children, sons Alexander (born 1981) and Rory (born 1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p18050.htm#i180491|title=Person Page|website=Thepeerage.com|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asher dislikes discussing or being asked about her relationship with McCartney; as she stated in 2004: "I've been happily married for 30-something years. It's insulting."&lt;ref name="The darkness behind the smile"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=David |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3622480/The-darkness-behind-the-smile.html |title=The darkness behind the smile |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 August 2004 |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2703">'''Jean Henri Simon''' (28 October 1752 – 12 March 1834) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[engraving|engraver]] and soldier.

==Life==
Simon was born in [[Brussels]]. He was a son of the engraver Jacob Simon, under whom he learned his trade. When not quite fifteen years of age he was appointed engraver to [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine]]. In 1775 he removed to [[Paris]], where he became engraver to the [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orleans]] in [[Chartres]], with a yearly salary of 200 [[thaler]]. He soon became engraver to King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], which position he held until 1792.

At the beginning of [[French Revolutionary Wars]], Simon commanded a company under General [[Charles François Dumouriez]]. The battles of [[Battle of Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] and [[Battle of Boucar|Boucar]], in both of which he was wounded, won him the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Returning to Paris, as a follower of Dumouriez he was accused of treason when the latter went over to the enemy, but he succeeded in proving himself innocent. He next went to [[Spain]], where he became engraver to the court, but was soon recalled to Paris as teacher of engraving at the [[Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris|Institute for Deaf-Mutes]]. After being banished for a short period, he was recalled and became engraver to the empress [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Josephine]]. In 1813 he rejoined the army, and served as colonel of a regiment of [[lancer]]s in the first corps of the francs-éclaireurs of the department of the Seine. Discharged on half-pay in 1814, he took no prominent part in the campaign of 1815, and in 1816 he went to Brussels, where he passed the rest of his life.

==Works==
Simon was an excellent engraver; he executed engravings on precious stones, some of which were mistaken for real antiques and were sold to the Empress of Russia. He likewise etched on copper, and his portraits of noted men of the Netherlands especially deserve mention. He also published ''L'Armorial général de l'Empire'', of which only volumes 1 and 2 appeared, under the patronage of the empress Josephine. Among his pupils were Dubois, Paul, Verger, Lalondre, and his own son Simon.

'''John of the Cross''' ({{lang-es|San Juan de la Cruz}}; 1542&lt;ref name=peers /&gt; – 14 December 1591) was a major figure of the [[Counter-Reformation]], a [[Spanish mystics|Spanish mystic]], a Roman Catholic [[saint]], a [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] [[friar]] and a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]], who was born at [[Fontiveros]], [[Old Castile]].

John of the Cross is known for his writings. Both his poetry and his studies on the growth of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] are considered the summit of [[mysticism|mystical]] Spanish literature and one of the peaks of all [[Spanish literature]]. He was [[canonized]] as a [[saint]] in 1726 by [[Pope Benedict XIII]]. He is one of the thirty-six [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]].

''Conversos, Inquisition, and the Expulsion of the Jews from Spain'', Madison, WI: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, pp. 157, 369&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Gonzalo, was an accountant to richer relatives who were silk merchants. However, when in 1529 he married John's mother, Catalina, who was an orphan of a lower class, Gonzalo was rejected by his family and forced to work with his wife as a weaver.&lt;ref&gt;Tillyer, Desmond. ''Union with God: The Teaching of St John of the Cross'', London &amp; Oxford: Mowbray, 1984, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  John's father died in 1545, while John was still only around three years old.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Brenan, ''St John of the Cross: His Life and Poetry'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1973), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, John's older brother Luis died, probably as a result of insufficient nourishment caused by the penury to which John's family had been reduced. After this, John's mother Catalina took John and his surviving brother Francisco, and moved first in 1548 to Arévalo, and then in 1551 to [[Medina del Campo]], where she was able to find work weaving.&lt;ref name=Kavanaugh&gt;{{cite book |last=Kavanaugh|first=Kieran|title=The Collected Works of St John of the Cross|year=1991|publisher=ICS Publications|location=Washington|isbn=0-935216-14-6|chapter=General Introduction: Biographical Sketch|pages=9–27|editor=Kieran Kavanaugh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="impact"&gt;{{cite book

In Medina, John entered a school for around 160{{sfn|Thompson, p.31}} poor children, usually orphans, receiving a basic education, mainly in Christian doctrine, as well as some food, clothing and lodging. While studying there, he was chosen to serve as [[acolyte]] at a nearby monastery of [[Augustinian]] nuns.&lt;ref name="Kavanaugh" /&gt; Growing up, John worked at a hospital and studied the humanities at a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school from 1559 to 1563; the [[Society of Jesus]] was a new organization at the time, having been founded only a few years earlier by the Spaniard St. [[Ignatius of Loyola]]. In 1563&lt;ref&gt;Kavanaugh (1991) names the date as 24 February. However, E. Allison Peers (1943), p. 13, points out that although this, the Feast of St. Matthias, is often assumed to be the date, Father Silverio postulates a date in August or September.&lt;/ref&gt; he entered the Carmelite Order, adopting the name '''John of St. Matthias'''.&lt;ref name="Kavanaugh" /&gt;

The following year (1564)&lt;ref&gt;At some point between 21 May and October. See E. Allison Peers, ''Spirit of Flame: A Study of St John of the Cross'' (London: SCM Press, 1943), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; he [[profession (religious)|professed]] his [[religious vows]] as a Carmelite and travelled to [[Salamanca]], where he studied theology and philosophy at the prestigious University there (at the time one of the four biggest in Europe, alongside Paris, Oxford and Bologna) and at the Colegio de San Andrés. Some modern writers {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} claim that this stay would influence all his later writings, as [[Luis Ponce de León|Fray Luis de León]] taught biblical studies ([[Exegesis]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]]) at the University: León was one of the foremost experts in Biblical Studies then and had written an important and controversial translation of the [[Song of Songs]] into [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. (Translation of the [[Bible]] into the vernacular was not allowed then in Spain, because of the possibility of mistranslation from Latin to Spanish which could create confusion.)

=== Joining the Reform of Teresa of Jesus ===
[[File:S. Juan de la Cruz y Santa Teresa.JPG|thumb|left|Statues representing John of the Cross and Teresa of Ávila in Beas de Segura]]
John was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] in 1567, and then indicated his intent to join the strict [[Carthusian]] Order, which appealed to him because of its encouragement of solitary and silent contemplation. A journey from Salamanca to [[Medina del Campo]], probably in September 1567, changed this.&lt;ref&gt;E. Allison Peers (1943, p. 16) suggests that the journey was in order to visit a nearby Carthusian monastery; Richard P. Hardy, ''The Life of St John of the Cross: Search for Nothing'' (London: DLT, 1982), p. 24, argues that the reason was for John to say his first mass&lt;/ref&gt; In Medina he met the charismatic Carmelite nun [[Teresa of Ávila|Teresa of Jesus (or Ávila)]]. She was in Medina to found the second of her convents for women.&lt;ref&gt;E. Allison Peers, ''Spirit of Flame: A Study of St John of the Cross'' (London: SCM Press, 1943), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; She immediately talked to him about her reformation projects for the Order: she was seeking to restore the purity of the Carmelite Order by restarting observance of its "Primitive Rule" of 1209, observance of which had been relaxed by [[Pope Eugene IV]] in 1432.

Under this Rule, much of the day and night was to be spent in the recitation of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|choir offices]], study and devotional reading, the celebration of Mass and times of solitude. For the friars, time was to be spent evangelizing the population around the monastery.{{sfn|Tillyer, p.8}} Total [[abstinence]] from meat and lengthy [[fasting]] was to be observed from the [[Feast of the Cross#September 14|Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross]] (September 14) until [[Easter]]. There were to be long periods of silence, especially between [[Compline]] and [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]]. Coarser, shorter habits, more simple than those worn since 1432, were to be worn.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, Richard P., ''The Life of St John of the Cross: Search for Nothing'' (London: DLT, 1982), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; They were to follow the [[injunction]] against the wearing of shoes (also mitigated in 1432). It was from this last observance that the followers of Teresa among the Carmelites were becoming known as "discalced", i.e., barefoot, differentiating themselves from the non-reformed friars and nuns.

Teresa asked John to delay his entry into the Carthusians and to follow her. Having spent a final year studying in Salamanca, in August 1568 John traveled with Teresa from Medina to [[Valladolid]], where Teresa intended to found another monastery of nuns. Having spent some time with Teresa in Valladolid, learning more about this new form of Carmelite life, in October 1568, accompanied by Friar Antonio de Jesús de Heredia, John left Valladolid to found a new monastery for friars, the first for men following Teresa's principles. They were given the use of a derelict house at [[Duruelo]] (midway between Ávila and Salamanca), which had been donated to Teresa. On 28 November 1568, the monastery&lt;ref&gt;The monastery may have contained three men, according to E. Allison Peers (1943), p. 27, or five, according to Richard P. Hardy, ''The Life of St John of the Cross: Search for Nothing'' (London: DLT, 1982), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; was established, and on that same day John changed his name to "John of the Cross".

Soon after, in June 1570, the friars found the house at Duruelo too small, and so moved to the nearby town of [[Mancera de Abajo]]. After moving on from this community, John set up a new community at [[Pastrana, Spain|Pastrana]] (October 1570), and a community at [[Alcalá de Henares]], which was to be a house of studies for the academic training of the friars. In 1572&lt;ref&gt;The month generally given is May. E. Allison Peers, ''Complete Works'' Vol. I (1943, xxvi), agreeing with P. Silverio, thinks it must have been substantially later than this, though certainly before 27 September.&lt;/ref&gt; he arrived in Ávila, at the invitation of Teresa, who had been appointed [[prior]]ess of the Monastery of the Incarnation there in 1571. John became the [[spiritual director]] and [[confessor]] for Teresa and the other 130 nuns there, as well as for a wide range of laypeople in the city.&lt;ref name="Kavanaugh" /&gt; In 1574, John accompanied Teresa in the foundation of a new monastery in [[Segovia]], returning to Ávila after staying there a week. Beyond this, though, John seems to have remained in Ávila between 1572 and 1577.{{sfn|Hardy, p.56}}

[[File:John of the Cross crucifixion sketch.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing of the crucifixion by John of the Cross]]

At some point between 1574 and 1577, while praying in the Monastery of the Incarnation in Ávila in a loft overlooking the sanctuary, John had a vision of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified Christ]], which led him to create his famous drawing of Christ "from above". In 1641, this drawing was placed in a small [[monstrance]] and kept in Ávila. This drawing inspired the artist [[Salvador Dalí]]'s 1951 work ''[[Christ of Saint John of the Cross]]''.

=== The height of Carmelite tensions ===
The years 1575–77, however, saw a great increase in the tensions among the Spanish Carmelite friars over the reforms of Teresa and John. Since 1566 the reforms had been overseen by [[canonical visitation|Canonical Visitors]] from the [[Dominican Order]], with one appointed to Castile and a second to [[Andalusia]]. These Visitors had substantial powers: they could move the members of religious communities from house to house and even [[ecclesiastical province|province]] to province. They could assist [[religious superior]]s in their office, and could depute other superiors from either the Dominicans or Carmelites. In Castile, the Visitor was Pedro Fernández, who prudently balanced the interests of the Discalced Carmelites against those of the friars and nuns who did not desire reform.&lt;ref&gt;He is possibly the same Pedro Fernández who became the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ávila#Leadership|Bishop of Ávila]] in 1581. It was he who appointed Teresa in 1571 as prioress in Ávila, but who also enjoyed good relations with the Carmelite [[provincial superior|Prior Provincial]] of Castile.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Andalusia to the south, however, where the Visitor was Francisco Vargas, tensions rose due to his clear preference for the Discalced friars. Vargas asked them to make foundations in various cities, in explicit contradiction of orders from the Carmelite [[Superior general|Prior General]] against their expansion in Andalusia. As a result, a [[General Chapter]] of the Carmelite Order was convened at [[Piacenza]] in Italy in May 1576, out of concern that events in Spain were getting out of hand, which concluded by ordering the total suppression of the Discalced houses.&lt;ref&gt;Kavanaugh (1991) states that this was all the Discalced houses founded in Andalusia. E. Allison Peers, ''Complete Works'', Vol. I, p. xxvii (1943) states that this was all the Discalced monasteries but two.&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure was not immediately enforced. [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II of Spain]] was supportive of some of Teresa's reforms, and so was not immediately willing to grant the necessary permission to enforce this ordinance. The Discalced friars also found support from the papal [[nuncio]] to King Philip II, {{Interlanguage link multi|Nicolò Ormaneto|it}}, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Padua|Bishop of Padua]], who still had ultimate power as nuncio to visit and reform religious Orders. When asked by the Discalced friars to intervene, Ormaneto replaced Vargas as Visitor of the Carmelites in Andalusia (where the troubles had begun) with [[Jerónimo Gracián]], a priest from the [[University of Alcalá]], who was in fact a Discalced Carmelite friar himself.&lt;ref name="Kavanaugh" /&gt; The nuncio's protection helped John avoid problems for a time. In January 1576, John was arrested in Medina del Campo by some Carmelite friars. However, through the nuncio's intervention, John was soon released.&lt;ref name="Kavanaugh" /&gt; When Ormaneto died on 18 June 1577, however, John was left without protection, and the friars opposing his reforms gained the upper hand.

=== Imprisonment, writings, torture, death and recognition ===
[[File:El Greco - View of Toledo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[El Greco]]'s landscape of Toledo depicts the priory in which John was held captive, just below the old Muslim ''[[alcázar]]'' and perched on the banks of the Tajo on high cliffs.]]
On the night of 2 December 1577, a group of Carmelites opposed to reform broke into John's dwelling in Ávila and took him prisoner. John had received an order from some of his superiors, opposed to reform, ordering him to leave Ávila and return to his original house, but John had refused on the basis that his reform work had been approved by the Spanish nuncio, a higher authority than these superiors.&lt;ref name="ascent"&gt;{{cite web

|pages = 10,11&lt;/ref&gt; The Carmelites therefore took John captive. John was taken from Ávila to the Carmelite monastery in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], at that time the Order's most important monastery in Castile, where perhaps 40 friars lived.&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Thompson, ''St. John of the Cross: Songs in the Night'' (London: SPCK, 2002), p. 48. Thompson points out that many earlier biographers have stated the number of friars at Toledo to be 80, but this is simply taken from Crisogono's Spanish biography. Alain Cugno (1982) gives the number of friars as 800 — which Thompson assumes is a misprint. However, as Thompson details, the actual number of friars has been reconstructed from comparing various extant documents that in 1576, 42 friars belonged to the house, with only about 23 of them resident, the remainder being absent for various reasons. This is done by J. Carlos Vuzeute Mendoza, 'La prisión de San Juan de la Cruz: El convent del Carmen de Toledo en 1577 y 1578', A. García Simón, ed, ''Actas del congreso internacional sanjuanista'', 3 vols. (Valladolid: Junta de Castilla y León, 1993) II, pp. 427-436&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Tyler, ''St John of the Cross'' (New York: Continuum, 2000), p. 28. The reference to the El Greco painting is also taken from here. The priory no longer exists, having been destroyed in 1936 — it is now the Toledo Municipal car park.&lt;/ref&gt; John was brought before a court of friars, accused of disobeying the ordinances of Piacenza. Despite John's argument that he had not disobeyed the ordinances, he received a punishment of imprisonment. He was jailed in the monastery,  where he was kept under a brutal regimen that included public lashing before the community at least weekly, and severe isolation in a tiny stifling cell measuring ten feet by six feet, barely large enough for his body. Except when rarely permitted an oil lamp, he had to stand on a bench to read his [[breviary]] by the light through the hole into the adjoining room. He had no change of clothing and a penitential diet of water, bread and scraps of salt fish.{{sfn|Tillyer, p.10}} During this imprisonment, he composed a great part of his most famous poem ''[[Spiritual Canticle]]'', as well as a few shorter poems. The paper was passed to him by the friar who guarded his cell.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark night of the soul''. Translation by Mirabai Starr. {{ISBN|1-57322-974-1}} p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He managed to escape nine months later, on 15 August 1578, through a small window in a room adjoining his cell. (He had managed to pry the cell door off its hinges earlier that day.)

After being nursed back to health, first with Teresa's nuns in Toledo, and then during six weeks at the Hospital of Santa Cruz,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Tyler, ''St John of the Cross'' (New York: Continuum, 2000), p. 33. The Hospital still exists, and is today a municipal art gallery in Toledo.&lt;/ref&gt; John continued with reform. In October 1578 he joined a meeting at [[Almodóvar del Campo]] of the supporters of reform, increasingly known as the [[Discalced Carmelites]]. There, in part as a result of the opposition faced from other Carmelites in recent years, they decided to demand from the Pope their formal separation from the rest of the Carmelite Order.&lt;ref name="Kavanaugh"/&gt;

At this meeting John was appointed superior of El Calvario, an isolated monastery of around thirty friars in the mountains about 6 miles away{{sfn|Thompson, p.117}} from [[Beas, Spain|Beas]] in Andalusia. During this time he befriended the nun [[Ana de Jesús]], superior of the Discalced nuns at Beas, through his visits every Saturday to the town. While at El Calvario he composed his first version of his commentary on his poem, ''The Spiritual Canticle'', perhaps at the request of the nuns in Beas.

In 1579 he moved to [[Baeza]], a town of around 50,000 people, to serve as [[rector (academic)|rector]] of a new college, the Colegio de San Basilio, to support the studies of Discalced friars in Andalusia. This opened on 13 June 1579. He remained in post there until 1582, spending much of his time as a spiritual director for the friars and townspeople.

1580 was an important year in the resolution of the disputes within the Carmelites. On 22 June, [[Pope Gregory XIII]] signed a decree, titled ''Pia Consideratione'', which authorised a separation between the Calced and Discalced Carmelites. The Dominican friar [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ávila#Leadership|Juan Velázquez de las Cuevas]] was appointed to carry out the decisions. At the first General Chapter of the Discalced Carmelites, in [[Alcalá de Henares]] on 3 March 1581, John of the Cross was elected one of the "Definitors" of the community, and wrote a set of constitutions for them.&lt;ref name="Jean de la Croix"&gt;[[:fr:Jean de la Croix]], Accessed 2012-10-13{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the Provincial Chapter at Alcalá in 1581, there were 22 houses, some 300 friars and 200 nuns in the Discalced Carmelites.{{sfn|Thompson, p.119}}

[[File:Sepulcro-de-san-juan-de-la-cruz-02.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint John of the Cross' shrine and reliquary, Convent of Carmelite Friars, Segovia]][[File:JohnCrossRelicsUbeda.jpg|thumb|Reliquary of John of the Cross in Úbeda, Spain]]

In November 1581, John was sent by Teresa to help Ana de Jesús in founding a convent in Granada. Arriving in January 1582, she set up a monastery of nuns, while John stayed in the friars' monastery of Los Mártires, beside the Alhambra, becoming its prior in March 1582.{{sfn|Hardy, p.90}} While here, he learned of the death of Teresa in October of that year.

In February 1585, John travelled to [[Málaga]] and established a monastery of Discalced nuns there. In May 1585, at the General Chapter of the Discalced Carmelites in Lisbon, John was elected Provincial Vicar of Andalusia, a post which required him to travel frequently, making annual visitations of the houses of friars and nuns in Andalusia. During this time he founded seven new monasteries in the region, and is estimated to have travelled around 25,000&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Thompson, ''St. John of the Cross: Songs in the Night'', London: SPCK, 2002, p. 122. This would have been largely by foot or by mule, given the strict rules which governed the way in which Discalced friars were permitted to travel.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1588, he was elected third Councillor to the Vicar General for the Discalced Carmelites, Father Nicolas Doria. To fulfill this role, he had to return to Segovia in Castile, where in this capacity he was also prior of the monastery. After disagreeing in 1590–1 with some of Doria's remodeling of the leadership of the Discalced Carmelite Order, though, John was removed from his post in Segovia, and sent by Doria in June 1591 to an isolated monastery in Andalusia called La Peñuela. There he fell ill, and traveled to the monastery at [[Úbeda, Spain|Úbeda]] for treatment. His condition worsened, however, and he died there on 14 December 1591, of [[erysipelas]].&lt;ref name="Kavanaugh" /&gt;

== Veneration ==
The morning after John’s death huge numbers of the townspeople of Úbeda entered the monastery to view his body; in the crush, many were able to take home parts of his habit. He was initially buried at [[Úbeda]], but, at the request of the monastery in Segovia, his body was secretly moved there in 1593. The people of Úbeda, however, unhappy at this change, sent a representative to petition the pope to move the body back to its original resting place. Pope Clement VIII, impressed by the petition, issued a Brief on 15 October 1596 ordering the return of the body to Úbeda. Eventually, in a compromise, the superiors of the Discalced Carmelites decided that the monastery at Úbeda would receive one leg and one arm of the corpse from Segovia (the monastery at Úbeda had already kept one leg in 1593, and the other arm had been removed as the corpse passed through Madrid in 1593, to form a relic there). A hand and a leg remain visible in a reliquary at the Oratory of San Juan de la Cruz in Úbeda, a monastery built in 1627 though connected to the original Discalced monastery in the town founded in 1587.&lt;ref name="Richard P Hardy 1982 pp113-130"&gt;Richard P Hardy, ''The Life of St John of the Cross: Search for Nothing'', (London: DLT, 1982), pp113-130&lt;/ref&gt;

The head and torso were retained by the monastery at Segovia. There, they were venerated until 1647, when on orders from Rome designed to prevent the veneration of remains without official approval, the remains were buried in the ground.  In the 1930s they were disinterred, and now sit in a side chapel in a marble case above a special altar built in that decade.&lt;ref name="Richard P Hardy 1982 pp113-130" /&gt;

Proceedings to beatify John began with the gathering of information on his life between 1614 and 1616, although he was only [[beatification|beatified]] in 1675 by [[Pope Clement X]], and was [[canonization|canonized]] by [[Pope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] in 1726. When his feast day was added to the [[General Roman Calendar]] in 1738, it was assigned to 24 November, since his date of death was impeded by the then-existing [[octave (liturgical)|octave]] of the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]].&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; This obstacle was removed in 1955 and in 1969 [[Pope Paul VI]] moved it to the ''dies natalis'' (birthday to heaven) of the saint, 14 December.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Church of England]] commemorates him as a "Teacher of the Faith" on the same date. In 1926, he was declared a [[Doctor of the Church]] by [[Pope Pius XI]] after the definitive consultation of [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]] [[Dominican Order|O.P.]], professor of philosophy and theology at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas]], ''Angelicum'' in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avvenire.it/Cultura/Pagine/il-tomista-assalto.aspx  Accessed 17 Feb., 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary works ==
[[File:El Monte Carmelo.jpg|thumb|upright|The Ascent of Mount Carmel, as depicted in the first edition of 1618 by Diego de Astor&lt;ref&gt;Eric Truman Dicken, ''The Crucible of Love'', (1963), pp. 238–242, points out that this image is neither a true representation of John's thought, nor is it true to the image drawn by John himself of the 'Mount'. This latter image was first published in 1929, and is a 1759 copy from an original (now lost) almost certainly drawn by John himself. It is the 1618 image, though, which was influential on later depictions of the 'Mount', such as in the 1748 Venice edition and 1858 Genoa editions of John's work.&lt;/ref&gt;]] Saint John of the Cross is considered one of the foremost poets in the [[Spanish language]]. Although his complete poems add up to fewer than 2500 verses, two of them—the ''[[Spiritual Canticle]]'' and the ''[[Dark Night of the Soul]]''—are widely considered masterpieces of Spanish poetry, both for their formal [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistic]] point of view and their rich [[symbol]]ism and imagery. His theological works often consist of commentaries on these poems. All the works were written between 1578 and his death in 1591, meaning there is great consistency in the views presented in them.

The ''Spiritual Canticle'' is an [[eclogue]] in which the bride (representing the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]) searches for the bridegroom (representing [[Christian views of Jesus|Jesus Christ]]), and is anxious at having lost him; both are filled with joy upon reuniting. It can be seen as a free-form Spanish version of the [[Song of Songs]] at a time when translations of the Bible into the vernacular were forbidden. The first 31 stanzas of the poem were composed in 1578 while John was imprisoned in Toledo. It was read after his escape by the nuns at Beas, who made copies of these stanzas. Over the following years, John added some extra stanzas. Today, two versions exist: one with 39 stanzas and one with 40, although with some of the stanzas ordered differently. The first redaction of the commentary on the poem was written in 1584, at the request of Madre Ana de Jesús, when she was prioress of the Discalced Carmelite nuns in Granada. A second redaction, which contains more detail, was written in 1585–6.&lt;ref name="Kavanaugh"/&gt;

The ''Dark Night'' (from which the [[Dark Night of the Soul|spiritual term]] takes its name) narrates the journey of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] from its bodily home to union with [[God]]. It happens during the night, which represents the hardships and difficulties met in detachment from the world and reaching the light of the union with the Creator. There are several steps in this night, which are related in successive stanzas. The main idea of the poem can be seen as the painful experience that people endure as they seek to grow in spiritual maturity and union with God. The poem of this title was likely written in 1578 or 1579. In 1584-5, John wrote a commentary on the first two stanzas and first line of the third stanza of the poem.&lt;ref name="Kavanaugh" /&gt;

The ''[[Ascent of Mount Carmel]]'' is a more systematic study of the ascetical endeavour of a soul looking for perfect union, God and the [[mysticism|mystical]] events happening along the way. Although it begins as a commentary on the poem ''The Dark Night'', it rapidly drops this format, having commented on the first two stanzas of the poem, and becomes a treatise. It was composed sometime between 1581 and 1585.&lt;ref name=Kavanaug&gt;Kavanaugh, ''The Collected Works of St John of the Cross'', 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

A four-stanza work, ''Living Flame of Love'', describes a greater [[intimacy]], as the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] responds to God's love. It was written in a first redaction at Granada between 1585-6, apparently in two weeks,&lt;ref name=Kavanau&gt;Kavanaugh, ''The Collected Works of St John of the Cross'', 634.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a mostly identical second redaction at La Peñuela in 1591.

These, together with his ''Dichos de Luz y Amor'' (or "Sayings of Light and Love") and [[Teresa of Ávila|Saint Teresa]]'s writings, are the most important mystical works in Spanish, and have deeply influenced later spiritual writers all around the world. Among these are [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Thérèse de Lisieux]], [[Edith Stein]] (Teresa Benedicta of the Cross) and [[Thomas Merton]]. John has also influenced philosophers ([[Jacques Maritain]]), theologians ([[Hans Urs von Balthasar]]), [[pacifists]] ([[Dorothy Day]], [[Daniel Berrigan]] and [[Philip Berrigan]]) and artists ([[Salvador Dalí]]). [[Pope John Paul II]] wrote his theological dissertation on the mystical theology of Saint John of the Cross.

=== Editions of his works ===
His writings were first published in 1618 by Diego de Salablanca. The numerical divisions in the work, still used by modern editions of the text, were introduced by Salablanca (they were not in John's original writings) in order to help make the work more manageable for the reader.&lt;ref name="Kavanaugh"/&gt; This edition does not contain the ''Spiritual Canticle'' however, and also omits or adapts certain passages, perhaps for fear of falling foul of the Inquisition.

The ''Spiritual Canticle'' was first included in the 1630 edition, produced by Fray Jeronimo de San José, at Madrid. This edition was largely followed by later editors, although editions in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries gradually included a few more poems and letters.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Saint John of the Cross''. Translated and edited by E. Allison Peers, from the critical edition of Silverio de Santa Teresa. 3 vols. (Westminster, MD: Newman Press, 1943). Vol. I, pp. l-lxxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

The first French edition was published in Paris in 1622, and the first Castilian edition in 1627 in Brussels.

== Intellectual influences ==
Working out the main influences on John’s thought has been an ongoing debate.

=== Scripture ===
John was clearly influenced by the [[Bible]]. Scriptural images are common in both his poems and prose—in total, there are 1,583 explicit and 115 implicit quotations from the Bible in his works.&lt;ref name=Tyler&gt;{{cite book |last=Tyler|first=Peter|title=St John of the Cross|year=2010|publisher=Continuum|location=New York}}, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the [[Song of Songs]] on the ''Spiritual Canticle'' has often been noted, both in terms of the structure of the poem, with its dialogue between two lovers, the account of their difficulties in meeting each other and the "offstage chorus" that comments on this action, and also in terms of the imagery of pomegranates, wine cellar, turtle dove and lilies, for example, which echoes that of the ''Song of Songs''.&lt;ref name=Tyler /&gt;

In addition, John shows at occasional points the influence of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]]. This demonstrates how John, steeped in the language and rituals of the Church, drew at times on the phrases and language here.&lt;ref&gt;This occurs in the ''Living Flame'' at 1.16 and 2.3. See John Sullivan, 'Night and Light: the Poet John of the Cross and the Exultet of the Easter Liturgy', ''Ephemerides Carmeliticae'', 30:1 (1979), pp. 52-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early studies ===
In order to gain a better understanding of the intellectual influences to which John was exposed in his formative years (and so to isolate what shaped his unusual theology), many scholars have tried to reconstruct John's likely course of studies while he was at [[Salamanca]] between 1563 and 1567, living at the Carmelite College of San Andrès and studying at the [[University of Salamanca]]. It has been widely acknowledged in the 20th century to be most likely that John would have received teaching both from the College of San Andres and from Salamanca University.&lt;ref&gt;This is contrary to the seventeenth-century biographies, which do not mention any classes at the College of San Andrès. This thesis was proposed by both Jean Baruzi, ''Saint Jean de la Croix'' (1924), and Crisgono de Jesús Sacramentado, ''San Juan de la Cruz'' (1929).&lt;/ref&gt;

If taught at the College of San Andrès, John would have been exposed to the teachings of both [[Michael of Bologna]] and [[John Baconthorpe]], with the Spanish Carmelites of the day concentrating more on Baconthorpe's thought.&lt;ref&gt;Crisogono, 1958, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, no clear signs of the influence of either writer in John's works. Perhaps no more can be said of the influence of Baconthorpe than that, given that he was a "subtle and eclectic scholar who did not hesitate to disagree with [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] on many important issues", it might be "that acquaintance with his works may have helped John to avoid any slavish adherence to Thomistic doctrines".&lt;ref&gt;Steven Payne, ''John of the Cross and the Cognitive Value of Mysticism: An Analysis of Sanjuanist Teaching and its Philosophical Implications for Contemporary Discussions of Mystical Experience'' (1990), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In the University itself, there is widely acknowledged to have existed a range of intellectual positions. Academic positions in John's time included Chairs of St. Thomas, Chairs of [[Duns Scotus|Scotus]] and [[Guillaume Durand|Durandus]].&lt;ref&gt;Crisogono (1958), pp. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, it is assumed that John would have been educated here in the thought of Thomas Aquinas, explaining the influence of Thomas on much of the scholastic framework of his writings.

However, the belief that John was taught at both the Carmelite College of San Andrès and at the University of Salamanca has been criticised.&lt;ref&gt;By L. Rodríguez-San Pedro Bezares, 'La Formación Universitaria de Juan de la Cruz', ''Actas del Congreso Internacional Sanjuanista'' (Valladolid, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; He argues, firstly, that it is unclear whether there were in fact lectures in arts and theology at the College of San Andrès before 1571, that a reconstruction of the typical timetable of teaching at the University of Salamanca shows that there would have been little time for extra teaching at the College of the San Andrès, and that what therefore happened at San Andrès (if indeed it happened at all) is therefore likely to have taken the form of rehearsals, preparation of classes, and not in an official form — making the idea that John received systematic exposure to Baconthorpe less likely.&lt;ref&gt;Bezares, pp. 14-23&lt;/ref&gt; More controversially, Bezares calls into question whether John even studied theology at the University of Salamanca. The philosophy courses John probably took in logic, natural and moral philosophy, can be reconstructed, but Bezares argues that John in fact abandoned his studies at Salamanca in 1568 to join Teresa, rather than having graduated, meaning that he did not study theology in Salamanca.&lt;ref&gt;Bezares, p19&lt;/ref&gt;

Another claim frequently made about John's time in Salamanca, by scholars trying to explain the origins of John's mystical thought, is that it was here he was exposed in detail to mystical thought. In the first biography of John, published in 1628, it is claimed, on the basis of information from John's fellow students, that he in 1567 made a special study of mystical writers, in particular of Pseudo-Dionysius and [[Pope Gregory I|Saint Gregory the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;The 1628 biography of John is by Quiroga. The information is from Crisogono (1958), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Much weight has been put on this evidence by later writers. However, others have doubted the veracity of this anecdote, even though they do not dispute that John may have studied mystical theology in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Eulogio Pacho (1969), pp. 56-59; Steven Payne, ''John of the Cross and the Cognitive Value of Mysticism: An Analysis of Sanjuanist Teaching and its Philosophical Implications for Contemporary Discussions of Mystical Experience'' (1990), p. 14, n. 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little consensus from John's early years on his potential influences. Although a list of theologians about whom John may have been taught can be drawn up, the evidence is not sufficient to make firm judgements on who may have influenced him.

=== Pseudo-Dionysius ===
It has rarely been disputed that the overall structure of John’s mystical theology, and his language of the union of the soul with God, is influenced by the pseudo-Dionysian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;John mentions Dionysius explicitly four times—S2.8.6; N2.5.3; CB14-15.16; Ll3-3.49. Luis Girón-Negrón, 'Dionysian thought in sixteenth-century Spanish mystical theology', ''Modern Theology'', 24(4), (2008), p699&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has not been clear whether John might have had direct access to the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], or whether this influence may have been mediated through various later authors.

The main conduit of Dionysian spirituality into ascetic-mystical literature on contemplative prayer in sixteenth-century prayer (such as that by John of the Cross and [[Teresa of Ávila]] appears to have been through the ''recogido'' tradition of [[Francisco de Osuna]], [[Bernardino de Laredo]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Girón-Negrón, 'Dionysian thought in sixteenth-century Spanish mystical theology'. ''Modern Theology'', 24(4), (2008), pp. 693–706.&lt;/ref&gt; Osuna’s focus on recogimiento (recollecting or gathering of the senses) as a means of prayer, bears similarity to John’s discussion of prayer, and may have been an influence.&lt;ref&gt;Nieto, ''Mystic, Rebel, Saint: A Study of St. John of the Cross'', (1979), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of Spanish writing, it is notable that although the second half of the sixteenth century produced many great mystics, mysticism was not common in Spain before that.

=== Medieval mystics ===
It is widely acknowledged that John may have been influenced by the writings of other medieval mystics, though there is debate about the exact thought which may have influenced him, and about how he might have been exposed to their ideas.

The possibility of influence by the so-called "[[Rhineland mystics]]" such as [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Johannes Tauler]], [[Henry Suso]] and [[John of Ruysbroeck]] has also been mooted by many authors.&lt;ref&gt;However, there is little precise agreement on which particular mystics may have been influential. [[Jean Orcibal]], ''S Jean de la Croix et les mystiques Rheno-Flamands'' (Desclee-Brouwer, Presence du Carmel, no. 6); Crisogono (1929), I, 17, believed that John was influenced more by German mysticism, than perhaps by [[Gregory of Nyssa]], [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard]], the [[School of Saint Victor]] and the ''[[The Imitation of Christ|Imitation]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have seen Tauler alone as most influential.&lt;ref&gt;Liz Carmichael, "Appendix", in Norbert Cummins, ''Freedom to Rejoice: Understanding St John of the Cross'', (1991). Carmichael argues that John's three signs by which the "night of sense" may be recognised are derived from the "Institutions", attributed in John's time to John Tauler, although actually a compendium of excerpts from various German writers of Tauler's time. The Institutions was published in Latin in 1548, and Castilian in 1551. Her hypothesis is that John must have had contact with this work at Salamanca, especially if he did indeed write a short thesis on contemplation while there.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the Rhineland mystics, others have argued for the influence of the Victorines and Bonaventure.&lt;ref&gt;A Benedictine of Stanbrook Abbey, ''Mediaeval Mystical Tradition and John of the Cross'' (London: Burns &amp; Oates, 1954) argues for the influence of (a) the Victorines (b) [[Bonaventure]] (c) the German and Flemish mystics.&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, Peter Tyler has argued that John adopts a style of writing, a "performative discourse", which works on both the reader's affect and intellect, in a tradition following a lineage from [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]], the [[School of Saint Victor|Victorines]], [[Jean Gerson]] and through intermediaries such as [[Francisco de Osuna]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Tyler, ''St John of the Cross'' (New York: Continuum, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear, though, how John might have had access to the works of the Rhineland mystics. These works were only translated into Latin in the second half of the sixteenth century. This means that copies would hardly have been easily available for John. In addition, if it is acknowledged that an influence on John was [[Francisco de Osuna]] (who clearly cannot have read the Rhineland mystics since they were not known in Spain in the 1520s), then another problem is raised.

=== Secular Spanish poetry ===
However, a strong argument can also be made for contemporary Spanish literary influences on John. This case was first made in detail by Dámaso Alonso,&lt;ref&gt;Dámaso Alonso, ''La poesía de San Juan de la Cruz'' (Madrid, 1942)&lt;/ref&gt; who believed that as well as drawing from scripture, John was transforming non-religious, profane themes, derived from popular songs (''romanceros'') into religious poetry; Alonso argued that John was particularly influenced by the works of the Spanish Renaissance poets [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]] and [[Juan Boscán Almogáver|Boscán]]. Certainly, John does appear to have used Garcilaso's verse forms in his own poetry, in particular in the ''Spiritual Canticle'', ''Dark Night'', and ''Living Flame of Love''. Alongside the various biblical images noted above, for example, exist in John's poems many new Renaissance symbols of pastoral love, prominent in the poetry of Garcilaso and Boscán, such as sirens, nightingales, nymphs, doves and shepherds.&lt;ref name=Tyler /&gt; Moreover, in the Prologue to the ''Living Flame'', John states that "the composition of these lyric lines is like those that in Boscán are given a religious meaning". Kavanaugh (1991)  also points out that these lines are in fact not by Boscán, but by Garcilaso, although the confusion was common at the time, as the works of the two poets had been published together.&lt;ref name=Kavana&gt;Kavanaugh, ''The Collected Works of St John of the Cross'', 640.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, though, have questioned the evidence for precisely how John might have been influenced by Boscán and Garcilaso. Dámaso Alonso argued that John must have read the newly published 1575 edition of the poets in [[Province of Ávila|Ávila]], shortly before his imprisonment in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], and that this must have been the key influence which rekindled in John memories of his own reading of Garcilaso as a young student of the Jesuits in [[Medina del Campo]]. However, Peter Thompson disputes this, arguing it is not definite John would have been familiar with Garcilaso from an early age, and even so the influence has been overemphasised by other commentators.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, p. 117, Peter Thompson, ''St. John of the Cross: Songs in the Night'' (London: SPCK, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic influence ===
A controversial theory of the origins of John’s mystical imagery is that he was influenced by Islamic sources. This was first proposed in detail by Miguel Asín Palacios and has been most recently put forward by the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] scholar [[Luce López-Baralt]].&lt;ref&gt;Luce Lopez Baralt, ''Juan de la Cruz y el Islam'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing that John was influenced by Islamic sources on the peninsula, she traces Islamic antecedents of the images of the "dark night", the "solitary bird" of the ''Spiritual Canticle'', wine and mystical intoxication (the ''Spiritual Canticle''), lamps of fire (the ''Living Flame'') and so on.

Peter Tyler, though, puts forward a number of coherent objections to this line of enquiry. Firstly, as he points out, these metaphors, while present in certain Islamic sources in other parts of the Muslim world, are not always prominent in the Andalucian and North African Islamic sources. Secondly, in any case, John is using them in different ways from the Islamic sources. Thirdly, and crucially, there seems to have been little cultural interplay between [[Islamic culture]] and [[Christian culture]] in Spain by the late sixteenth century, with sources existing in different languages, not being translated, and of course all Muslims already having been forced to leave Spain. Rather, Tyler concludes, there "are sufficient Christian medieval antecedents for many of the metaphors John employs to suggest we should look for Christian sources rather than Muslim sources".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Tyler, ''St John of the Cross'' (2010), pp. 138-142&lt;/ref&gt; As José Nieto indicates, in trying to locate a link between Spanish Christian mysticism and Islamic mysticism, it might make more sense to refer to the common Neo-Platonic tradition and mystical experiences of both, rather than seek direct influence.&lt;ref&gt;José Nieto, ''Mystic, Rebel, Saint: A Study of St. John of the Cross'' (Geneva, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ahistorical theories ===
Jean Baruzi argued that the Spanish mystics created their decisive symbols independently of the historical conditions of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baruzi, ''Saint Jean de la Croix et la problème de l'experience mystique'' (Paris, 1924)&lt;/ref&gt; This theory, however, has not been widely pursued.

The '''Kashmir Smast''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|کشمیر سمست}}}}) caves, also called '''Kashmir Smats''' ({{nq|کشمیر سمتس}}), are a series of natural limestone caves, artificially expanded from the [[Kushan]] to the [[Kabul Shahi|Shahi]] periods, situated in the Pirsai Sakrah mountains in the [[Rustam, Mardan|Sudam Valley]] [[Mardan]] in Northern [[Pakistan]].  According to recent scholarship based on a rare series of bronze coins and artifacts found in the region, the caves and their adjacent valley probably comprised a sovereign kingdom in [[Gandhara]] which maintained at least partial independence for almost 500 years, from c. 4th century AD to the 9th century AD.&lt;ref name="Ziad"&gt;Waleed Ziad (2006), "Treasures of Kashmir Smast, followed by interview with Ijaz Khan" in ''Oriental Numismatic Society Journal- Volume 187''&lt;/ref&gt;  For most of its history, it was ruled by [[White Hun]] (or [[Hephthalite]]) governors or princes.

==Name==

"Smast" is a mistranscription of the [[Pashto language|Pashto]] word for 'cave,' which is actually ''smats'' ({{lang-ps|سمست}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qamosona.com/AA/g1/index.php/term/15,15239.xhtml Pashto - English Larg Dictionary]; M.G. Aslanov, ''Pushtu-russkii slovar'' (Moscow: "Russkii yazyk", 1985), p. 522 (سمست смəц); and, e.g., Edward George G. Hastings, ''Report of the Regular Settlement of the Peshawar District of the Punjab'' (Central Jail Press, 1878), p. 16: "Smats is the Pashto word for cave."&lt;/ref&gt;

As for "Kashmir", the Gazetteer of the Peshawar district 1897-1898 describes that “the name [Kashmir Smast] may be derived from the fact that the gorge here is fairly and picturesquely wooded, and this may have suggested Kashmir.”  Another explanation is that according to legend, the network caves was so vast that it stretched from Gandhara to the kingdom of [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref name="The Kashmir Smast Project"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027002731/http://geocities.com/ziadnumis/home  Hephthalite History and Coins of the Kashmir Smast Kingdom- Waleed Ziad]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Ancient hindu wood carving peshawar.jpg|thumb|One of the wooden sculptured panels discovered by Major [[Harold Arthur Deane|H.A. Deane]] in the 1880s that is now in the [[British Museum]], 9th-10th centuries AD.]]
A number of the cells had wooden architectural interiors, carved with elaborate [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] iconography.  Examples of these panels can be found in the [[British Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=35562&amp;plaA=35562-3-2 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; Remarkably, excavations at the Kashmir Smast site have not only brought forth artifacts of extreme historical importance but have also uncovered one of the most well organized town planning systems in ancient [[Gandhara]].

Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]] in “The Ancient Geography of India” and in the “Archaeological Survey Reports” outlined the principal ancient sites in Gandhara, which at that time was part of the [[Yusufzai]] subdivision. Among the sites covered is the Kashmir Smast.

The Kashmir Smast sites are described by Cunningham as cave temples situated near the summit of the Sakri ridge of Pajja, and approached from the village in Babozai in the tappah Baezai, it can easily be approached from village Pirsai.  Cunningham associated the Kashmir Smast with the cave of Prince Sudana in Mount Dantalok, described by the contemporary Chinese traveler [[Xuanzang]].

A detailed discussion of the site in the Gazetteer of the [[Peshawar]] district 1897-1898 states the following:

:“This cave has not been thoroughly explored yet…  A little way below the level of the cave, and opposite, there are the ruins of a small city, the walls of which still stand and are in good preservation…”

:“The cave is situated on a cliff looking towards the south-west below the ridge on which the Kashmir Burj stands.  A road from Pirsai crosses the ridge, which is practicable for most of the distance for a good hill pony.  Another footpath leads to Babozai direct from the cave…”

It goes on to describe the layout of the caves:

:“There are three chambers in the [[limestone]] rock, of which the first two open into each other, and the third is reached by a winding flight of steps. The length of the first two chambers from the entrance is {{convert|322|ft|m}}, and the height of the first about 60, and of the second about {{convert|100|ft|m}}.  The width of the first cave is {{convert|81|ft|m}} and of the second {{convert|90|ft|m}}, and fully between them about {{convert|40|ft|m}}.  The third cave is {{convert|80|ft|m}} high, and above {{convert|80|ft|m}} in [[diameter]], with an opening in the roof which admits light and air, so that the air throughout is pure…”

:“In the third cave there is a square temple built on a dome-shaped rock of [[stalagmite]], which was evidently the holiest shrine.  In the first cave there is an octagonal shrine just inside the entrance which contained a large wooden [[coffin]], and in a similar [[shrine]] near the right wall some carved wooden plaques with figures of a fakir dancing and a woman giving flowers to the fakir, and portions of a wooden box were found.  In the center room there is a large square shrine, and a water tank {{convert|13|ft|m}} wide, {{convert|20|ft|m}} long, and {{convert|10|ft|m}} deep.  About {{convert|100|ft|m}} below the cave towards Babozai on a plateau there are remains of a considerable fort…  The Kashmir Burj and another on a western spur of [[Pajja]] were also evidently outposts to guard this shrine.  The entrance to the cave is difficult as the old masonry steps have fallen down and the cliff is very precipitous…”

:“There are well built stone castles dating back to [[Buddhist]] times all along the northern hills.  One near Saughar in Baezai is specially interesting, as the care taken to bring down in a small stone duct that scanty supply of water from a spring, which still exists in the hill above the castle or monastery, would seem to show that the water supply was not much more plentiful then than it is at present.”

What is being described here is an enclosed and [[Fortification|fortified complex]] comprising a city and temples built into natural caves. The presence of walls and a water system serving the area would indicate a certain level of economic independence exerted in the region.&lt;ref name="Ziad"/&gt;

The most recent research, conducted by a World know archaeologist and historian Prof. Meritorious Dr. M. Nasim Khan, has shown that apart form Taxila, Kashmir Smast was another important centre of eduction and is regarded as the earliest seat of Hindu learning (M. Nasim Khan 2018).
==Numismatic discoveries==
[[Image:KashmirSmastSeal.jpg|thumb|A Bronze Personal Seal from the Kashmir Smast of ''Sri Randrokshi'' ([[Pakistan]]/ [[Gandhara]], c. 375-400).]]
[[Image:Kashmir Smast Queen.JPG|thumb|450px| Image of a Hunnic Queen on a bronze coin of Kashmir Smast ([[Pakistan]]/ [[Gandhara]], c. 375-400).]]
Given the fact that exact find data is not available for the coins of the Kashmir Smast, and that numerous symbols, legends, and images on the coins have come to light which have never before been encountered in 150 years of Hunnic [[numismatic]] study, the attribution and dating of these specimens becomes an arduous task. In the varieties of coins found in the Kashmir Smast, it becomes apparent that during the period of the Kidara, the Alxon, the Nazek, the Turk Shahis, and the Hindu Shahis, a minor kingdom based in this region maintained some level of autonomy from the greater Hunnic hordes which ruled Gandhara.  This is evidenced by the use of hithertofore unrecorded images, stylistic peculiarities, and tamghas (royal symbols).

The bronze coins found in cave and its adjacent valley can be divided into seven groups:

1)      '''[[Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom|Kushano-Sassanian]]'''.  The hoard includes numerous Kushano-Sassanian bronzes of the dumpy fabric, including mostly known varieties in addition to unpublished fractionals, and a number of anonymous Hunnic imitations minted in the dumpy Kushano-Sassanian fabric.

2)      '''[[Kidara]]'''.  [[Kidarite]] coins in the hoard comprise the majority of unpublished specimens.  The obverse of some varieties closely resemble, or are crudely rendered versions of, known Kidarite drachms.  The busts portrayed on these coins are depicted wearing headdresses associated with particular Kidara princes, often in turn borrowed from contemporary [[Sassanian]] / Kushano-Sassanian monarchs.  This group also includes thin AE units featuring bearded busts occasionally with Brahmi legends.  As they are notably different from other recorded Kushano-Sassanian bronzes, they may be attributed to Kidarite governors or princes under Kushano-Sassanian or Sassanian sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Ziad 3"&gt;Waleed Ziad (2006), "A queen consort of the early Kidarite principality of Kashmir Smast" in ''Oriental Numismatic Society Journal'' Vol. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

3)      '''Alxon''' (or [[Alchon]]) Huns.  The hoard includes a number of coins which are stylistically similar to the Alxon Hunnic series.  Some feature the royal Hunnic tamgha, or royal symbol, most often associated with the first of the Alxon Hunnic kings in Gandhara, Khingila and his immediate successors.&lt;ref name="Ziad 2"&gt;Waleed Ziad (2006), "Unpublished bronzes of the Alchon Hunnic period from Kashmir Smast" in ''Oriental Numismatic Society Journal'' Vol. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

4)      '''Nezak'''.  Common published Nazek bronzes abound in the hoard.  In addition to these, a number of unpublished varieties with stylistic similarities to Nezak bronzes have also been discovered, notably featuring a trident tamgha.

5)      '''Turk Shahi'''.  These include small AE units imitating larger silver Turk Shahi drachms.  They are either anepigraphic or feature [[Bactrian Greek]] legends.

6)      '''The Shahi Kings of Kabul and Gandhara'''.  This category includes coins stylistically similar to the coins of '''[[Samanta Deva]]''' and [[Spalapati Deva]], characterized by linear stylized anthropomorphic or zoomorphic representations.

7)      '''Anonymous coins''' which can not be stylistically attributed to any particular Hunnic period or clan.

8)      Bronze imitations of [[Bactria]]n drachms of [[Menander I]] and other dynasts.&lt;ref name="Menander Imitation"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/ziadnumis/IndoGreekKS.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+03:13:30  AE Hunnic Imitations of Indo-Greek Drachms from the Mardan Valley- Waleed Ziad]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and monetary independence==

Scholars contend that the bronze currency found in the region were issued by local semi-independent governors, or Tegins, in the Kashmir Smast valley, paying allegiance to the greater Hunnic Tegins of [[Gandhara]] and [[Bactria]].  The feudal and tribal nature of the ancient [[Central Asian]]' states allowed for substantial independence to be exercised by local governors.

It is worth noting that all the new varieties found in this area are small bronze pieces, varying in weight between 0.5 and 1.1 g. (referred to as the Kashmir Smast standard).  They are occasionally small versions of more common drachms circulating in the region, or feature entirely new portraits / images with some or no resemblance to commonly circulating coins of the period.

Given the fact that these pieces have not been found elsewhere in Hunnic domains, we can infer that they were not considered acceptable currency outside of the Kashmir Smast region.  However, imitating the coins of the contemporary rulers of [[Gandhara]], and employing certain of their dynastic symbols and portraits, alongside a totally new set of portraits, names / titles, and symbols, may indicate that while they were issued independently for use in the local kingdom, the local rulers must have paid homage to and acknowledged their [[Huns#Unified Empire under Attila|Hunnic]] overlords.  The fact that they were allowed to use some of their own tamghas and titles and that the greater chiefs gave them the privilege of minting their own currency strengthens this argument.  The minting of coins was a prerogative of the rulers, and carried with it a certain degree of governing authority.  Numismatically speaking, this can be likened to the period of Hephthalite and Turk Shahi sovereignty over [[Sogdiana]], during which civic bronze coinage circulated alongside of silver drachms referencing a Hunnic or Turkic overlord (the Bukharkhoda).  The fact that such independent issues continued throughout five separate dynasties, until the [[Hindu Shahi]] period, means that to a degree this principality maintained its status for perhaps as long as three to four hundred years.&lt;ref name="Ziad"/&gt;

There are only pre-diocesan jurisdictions (all exempt, i.e. not part of an [[ecclesiastical province]] but directly dependent on the [[Holy See]] and its missionary [[Roman Congregation Propaganda Fide]]), no single proper see yet :

* two [[Apostolic Prefecture]]s, both in Cambodia.

There are no [[titular see]]s in either country.
 
All defunct jurisdictions have current successors.

Formally there are an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] (embassy-level) to Cambodia &lt;br&gt;and an [[Apostolic Delegation]] (lower level) to Laos, as papal diplomatic representations in both countries, ''but these offices are vested (like the Apostolic Delegation to [[Myanmar]]) in the Apostolic Nuncio to [[Thailand]] (in its capital [[Bangkok]]).

{{Eastern Catholicism}}
The '''Melkite Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch''' is the only actual residential Patriarchate of the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]] ([[Eastern Catholic]], [[Byzantine Rite]]). It was formed in 1724 when a portion of the [[Antiochian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church of Antioch]] went back into communion with Rome, becoming an [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic Church]], while the rest of the ancient Patriarchate continues in full communion with the rest of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

The Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarch of Antioch's present complete title is ''Patriarch of Antioch and of All the East, of Alexandria and of Jerusalem of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church'', incorporating both of the church's other titular patriarchates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.melkitepat.org/eng/gregorios/view/biographical-notice&lt;/ref&gt;

Its archiepiscopal see is the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Dormition|Cathedral of the Dormition of Our Lady]] (Arabic: كاتدرائية سيدة النياح للروم الملكيين في دمشق ) in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]]. It enjoyed a [[Papal visit]] from [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2001.

The Melkite Greek Catholic Church is one of five churches that are continuations of the original [[See of Antioch]]. Thus, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church traces its existence all the way back to [[Saint Peter]] in a line of [[apostolic succession]] acknowledged by both Catholic and Orthodox canons. This claim is accepted by the [[Holy See]] and is not disputed by the other two [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] that also claim descent from the ancient See of Antioch, namely the [[Maronite Church]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tanbourit.com/first_patriarch.htm The Maronites First Patriarch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Syriac Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opuslibani.org.lb/church/syriac/ehistory.htm The Syriac Catholic Church: History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603185832/http://www.opuslibani.org.lb/church/syriac/ehistory.htm |date=2008-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which both also have Patriarchs of Antioch.

== Proper province and archdiocese ==
The Patriarch also holds the office of [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of an empty [[Ecclesiastical province]] without an actual [[suffragan]] see, actually comprising only his proper '''Metropolitan Archeparchy of Damascus (of the Melkites)'''/ Damasco (Curiate Italian) / Dimašq / Aš-Šām / Damascen(us) Græcorum Melkitarum (Latin). Like the Patriarchate, in Rome it depends only upon the [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches]].

As per 2014, it pastorally served 3,000 Catholics in 8 parishes and 1 mission with 9 priests (6 diocesan, 3 religious), 3 deacons, 33 lay religious (3 brothers, 30 sisters) and 10 seminarians.

== Titular Patriarchates of Alexandria and of Jerusalem ==

'''Mike S. Adams''' (born [[Columbus, Mississippi]], October 30, 1964&lt;ref name="Townhall" /&gt;) is an American [[conservative]] political columnist, writer, author and professor at [[University of North Carolina Wilmington]] (UNCW).&lt;ref name="Townhall" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/12/01/california-school-ferguson-grief-sessions-blasted-by-former-regent/|title=California school's Ferguson 'grief' sessions blasted by former regent|date=December 1, 2014|publisher=FOX News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Hailing from [[Clear Lake, Texas|Clear Lake]], [[Texas]], Adams obtained an associate's degree in psychology from [[San Jacinto College]] in [[Pasadena]], Texas. He then transferred to [[Mississippi State University]], where he was a brother of [[Sigma Chi]], to finish his BA. He remained at Mississippi State to obtain a MS in [[psychology]], followed by his doctorate in [[criminology]]. In 1993, UNCW hired Adams to teach in the criminal justice program. Adams won the Faculty Member of the Year award in 1998 and again in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uncw.edu/soccrm/mikeadams.html|title=Mike Adams: Sociology and Criminology|publisher=University of North Carolina Wilmington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Harbor House published Adams' first book, ''Welcome to the Ivory Tower of Babel'', in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Welcome_to_the_Ivory_Tower_of_Babel.html?id=XwrwYFh-60cC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Welcome to the Ivory Tower of Babel: Confessions of a Conservative College Professor|first=Mike S.|last=Adams|date=19 October 2018|publisher=Harbor House|accessdate=19 October 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentinel published his second book, ''Feminists Say the Darndest Things: A Politically Incorrect Professor Confronts "Womyn" On Campus'', in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Sentinel HC| isbn = 9781595230423| last = Adams| first = Mike| title = Feminists Say the Darndest Things: A Politically Incorrect Professor Confronts "Womyn" on Campus| location = New York| date = 2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Adams joined the faculty of [[Summit Ministries]] in [[Manitou Springs]], [[Colorado]], where he spends his summers lecturing against [[abortion]] and defending [[First Amendment]] rights on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.summit.org/about/faculty-bios/|title=Faculty - Summit Ministries|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams has written several hundred articles as a political conservative columnist for such publications as [[Townhall.com]]&lt;ref name="Townhall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/mikeadams/|title=Mike Adams|publisher=Townhall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Daily Wire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailywire.com/news/9387/how-explain-microaggressions-stupid-blondes-mike-s-adams|title=How To Explain Microaggressions To Stupid Blondes|date=22 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invasion of privacy controversy==
Adams first came to prominence after the [[September 11 attacks]], when a UNCW student emailed him requesting commentary on American policy errors in the [[Middle East]]. After Adams' dismissive reply, the student demanded for UNCW to grant access to his private emails.&lt;ref name="thefire.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefire.org/cases/university-of-north-carolina-at-wilmington-invasion-of-professors-privacy-and-suppression-of-speech/|title=University of North Carolina at Wilmington: Invasion of Professor’s Privacy and Suppression of Speech - FIRE|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the [[Foundation for Individual Rights in Education]] stepped in to uphold Adams' remarks, as protected by the First Amendment.&lt;ref name="thefire.org"/&gt; As a result of this dispute, Adams became a vocal critic of "the leftist bias in academia", which he considers to be against free speech. Since then, Adams has been interviewed on national television by [[Sean Hannity]], [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], [[Glenn Beck]], [[Megyn Kelly]], and [[Pat Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glennbeck.com/2013/08/27/conservative-professor-embarrasses-liberal-critic-with-this-epic-response/|title=Conservative professor embarrasses liberal critic with this epic response|date=27 August 2013|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legacy-management.com/adams_bio.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/mikeadams/2014/12/10/megyn-kelly-and-the-abortion-phile-n1929127|title=Mike Adams - Megyn Kelly And The Abortion Phile|first=Mike|last=Adams|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.cbn.com/video/fighting-the-academic-persecution-of-christians|title=Fighting the Academic Persecution of Christians|website=CBN.com - The Christian Broadcasting Network|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment discrimination lawsuits==
In 2007, Adams was denied a promotion by the UNCW administration and sued university officials, alleging religious and speech-based discrimination.&lt;ref name="2011Case"&gt;''[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-4th-circuit/1562438.html Adams v. University of North Carolina–Wilmington]'', 640 F.3d 550 (4th Cir. 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Adams specifically alleged that the university had discriminated against him on the basis of his Christian views and writings.&lt;ref name="Baird"&gt;Pressley Baird, [http://www.starnewsonline.com/news/20140320/professor-wins-lawsuit-against-uncw Professor wins lawsuit against UNCW], ''Wilmington Star News'' (March 20, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina]] initially granted [[summary judgment]] in favor of university officials.&lt;ref name="2011Case"/&gt; Adams appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]], where he was supported by the [[American Association of University Professors]], [[Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression]], and [[Foundation for Individual Rights in Education]], which filed an [[amicus brief]] in his support.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aaup.org/brief/adams-v-university-north-carolina%E2%80%93wilmington-640-f3d-550-4th-cir-2011 Adams v. University of North Carolina–Wilmington, 640 F.3d 550 (4th Cir. 2011)], American Association of University Professors.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Fourth Circuit reversed "the district court's grant of summary judgment as to Adams' [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] claims of viewpoint discrimination and retaliation" and sent the case back to the district court.&lt;ref name="2011Case"/&gt; The Fourth Circuit, however, upheld the district court's grant on summary judgment to the defendants on Adams' [[Title VII]] and [[Equal Protection Clause]] claims, finding that there was "simply no direct evidence that the Defendants treated Adams differently based on his religious beliefs."&lt;ref name="2011Case"/&gt;

In 2014, on remand in the district court, Adams won at a jury trial, bringing a seven-year legal battle to a close.&lt;ref name="Baird"/&gt; UNCW filed an appeal with the Fourth Circuit, but that appeal did not proceed because the parties settled the case. Under the terms of the settlement, Adams was promoted to full professor and received seven years' back pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adfmedia.org/files/AdamsSettlement.pdf|title=Settlement Agreement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Adams is currently a member of the [[National Rifle Association]] and the [[National Association of Scholars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uncw.edu/soccrm/mikeadams.html|title=Mike Adams: Sociology and Criminology: UNCW|website=uncw.edu|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams says that he is a Christian and a former atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focusonthefamily.com/socialissues/citizen-magazine/education/dr-mike-adams-from-classroom-to-courtroom-sept-2014|title=Dr. Mike Adams: From Classroom to Courtroom|date=3 September 2014|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Entrance of Janam Asthan-2.jpg|thumb|The massacre took place at [[Gurdwara Janam Asthan]], in modern-day [[Pakistan]].]]
{{Sikhism sidebar}}
The '''Nankana massacre''' (or '''Saka Nankana''') took place in [[Nankana Sahib]] gurdwara on 20 February 1921, at that time of British India, in modern-day [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Sikh24.com 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=95th Anniversary Of Nankana Massacre Observed At Gurdwara Nankana Sahib | website=Sikh24.com | date=23 February 2016 | url=https://www.sikh24.com/2016/02/23/95th-anniversary-of-nankana-massacre-observed-at-gurdwara-nankana-sahib/ | accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; more then a dozen Sikhs were killed by the Mahant and his mercenaries.&lt;ref&gt;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/martyrs-of-nankana-sahib-massacre-remembered-in-pak/articleshow/57280793.cms&lt;/ref&gt; The event forms an important part of [[Sikh]] [[history]]. In political significance, it comes next only to [[Amritsar Massacre|Jallianwala Bagh massacre]] of April 1919. The saga constitutes the core of the [[Gurdwara Reform Movement]] started by the Sikhs in early twentieth century.

==Historical background==
{{Context|section|date=February 2017}}
The [[Sikh]] [[faith]] was founded by [[Guru Nanak]] in fifteenth century and his divine torch was carried on by nine gurus who had followed in succession. The concepts of Sangat, Pangat, Dharamshala (Gurdwara) and Kirtan took firm roots during this period and became important constituents of [[Sikhism]]. [[Wiktionary:congregation|Congregations]] in Gurdwaras had played crucial roles in the religious and social affairs of the early Sikhs. Later, they assumed wider dimensions by transforming into religio-political organisation. The ''peaceful'' and ''non-political'' budding Sikh brotherhood was transformed into a proud and fiercely martial nation through the [[baptism]]ic process of [[Amrit Sanskar|Amrit-pan]]. After a long and continuous resistance of several decades against the tyrannies of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule, the brave Sikhs finally emerged victorious and succeeded in carving out 12 Khalsa principalities in Punjab which soon led to the creation of a unified Khalsa kingdom with [[Ranjit Singh]] at the helms. Maharaja Ranjit Singh reconstructed the Gurdwaras earlier destroyed by the [[Moghul]]s and also raised many new ones at the sacred places connected with the Sikh Gurus. For the sustenance of the Mahants, Maharaja Ranjit Singh had attached handsome landed properties with many of these Gurdwaras. The earlier Mahants were devoted Sikhs and true [[missionary|missionaries]] who did a lot for the spread of [[Sikhism]]. As the times rolled by, the Gurdwara incomes swelled enormously and the enormous money corrupted and degenerated the later-time Mahants into loose lived individuals. They started treating the Gurdwara properties as if they were their personal fiefs. This changed the things for Sikh Panth.

==Objectionable activities within Nankana==
[[Gurdwara Janam Asthan|Gurdwara Nankana Sahib]] was managed by Mahant Narayan Das, a Punjabi Brahmin in the early 20th century. This Gurdwara had a huge property of over 19000 acres (77&amp;nbsp;km²) of highly fertile land attached to it which yielded enormous income per year.

Dance girls were allegedly brought to the Gurdwara and dances were held and obscene songs were sung within the holy premises.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} In 1917, he is said to have arranged a dance-show by a [[prostitute]] near the holy Gurdawara.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} In 1918, a retired A.A.C. officer paid visit to the Gurdwara with his 13-year-old daughter to offer prayers to the Guru. As the Rehraas was being read in the Gurdwara, the mahant was allegedly raping the minor girl in another room within the Gurdwara premises.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} When the father lodged a complaint with the mahant to take action against the rapist, Mahant is said to have ignored his request. In the same year, six young female devotees from Jaranwal village (modern [[Faisalabad]], [[Pakistan]]) visited the Gurdawara on Puranmashi (full moon) to pay their offerings at Gurdwara and they too were similarly raped by the mahant in that gurdwara.&lt;ref&gt;Teja Singh, The Gurdwara Reform Movement and the Sikh Awakening, Amritsar, 1984, p 154; Kambojjas Through the Ages, 2005, pp 298, S Kirpal Singh&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protests by Akalis ==
All this went on before the very eyes of the Sikhs which had sent shock waves across Punjab. The issue was effectively raised in ''The Akali'' (Punjabi), published from Lahore by [[Master Sunder Singh Lyallpuri]] (q.v.), father of the [[Akali movement]] and [[Shiromani Akali Dal]].&lt;ref&gt;''Master Sunder Singh Lyallpuri was from Sandha clan and [[Kamboj]] [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Lyallpuri belonged to Bohoru village close to [[Nankana Sahib]] and he personally preached against the supposed debauchery of the Mahant in the nearby villages and also continued to organize the Sikhs for a movement to bring reforms into the Gurdwaras.&lt;ref&gt;The Kambojas Through the Ages, 2005, pp 298-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1920, a congregation was held at Dharowal in Sheikhupura (modern day Pakistan) for reform in Gurdwara [[Nankana Sahib]]. The supposed actions committed within Gurdwara by Mahant were revealed to the Sangat. On January 24, Shiromani Committee held a general meeting and took decision to hold a Dewan in Nankana Sahib on March 4, 5 and 6 and advise Mahant to mend his ways.

==Mahant's reaction==

According to some, the Mahant was a shrewd politician who publicly impressed that he was anxious to settle the issues with the [[Panth]]. On February 14, Mahant held a meeting with his associates to chalk out a plan to kill the opposing Sikh leaders on March 5 at Nankana Sahib.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Mahant recruited 400 mercenaries, including [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] paid at twenty Indian rupees per month to oppose the Sikhs. With government's help, Mahant also collected [[gun]]s, [[pistol]]s and other [[arm]]s and [[ammunition]]. He also arranged and stored fourteen tins of paraffin and further strengthened the Gurdwara gate and carved out shooting galleries.

Mahant Narayan Das had the backing from the Mahants of other Gurdwaras in Punjab. The [[Bedi clan|Bedi]] Jagirdars who had received Jagirs from the English Government by virtue of their past connections with [[Guru Nanak]] also supported the Mahant. Sardar Sunder Singh Majithia also maintained double standards.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} But [[Maharaja]] of [[Patiala]] flatly refused to back Mahant and offered him a healthy advice not to rebel against the Panth. He further advised the Mahant to create a committee of prominent Sikhs and hand over the Gurdwara charge to them. But Mahant ignored the advice of [[Patiala]] Royal house.

The Shiromani Committee extended invitation to Mahant for talks at Gurdwara ''Khara Sauda'' to resolve the issue but he did not show up at the given time. Then he offered to hold talks with the Sikh leaders in [[Sheikhupura]] on February 15, 1921, but again he failed to show up. Third time he promised to meet the Shiromani Committee leaders at the residence of Sardar Amar Singh ''Lyall Gazette'' on February 16, but once again he failed to turn up.

==Counter-response of the Sikhs==
The Shiromani Committee decided of its own to meet the Mahant on 3 March 1921 to advise him to hand over the charge to the committee. But the Committee got the information from its own intelligence that Mahant was planning to invite the Sikh leaders at Nanakana Sahib and have them killed from hired gundas. This greatly angered Kartar Singh Jhabber and others. A meeting of the Sikh leaders was called at Gurdwara Khara Sauda on 16, 1921 to chalk out the future course of action. It was decided that Sangat would go in ''Jathas'' (squads) and take charge of the Gurdwara. Sikh leaders learnt that Mahant was going to [[Lahore]] on 20 February 1921. Bhai [[Kartar Singh Jhabbar]] and Bhai Lachaman Singh Dharowali decided to take their jathas to Nanakana Sahib on 20 February.

On the evening of February 19, 1921, Bhai Lachaman Singh Dharowali reached Nizam Deva Singhwala with his jatha of 8 Singhs (6 males and two females). At Nizam Deva Singh wala, Jathedar Tehal Singh ([[Kamboj]] [[Sikh]]) had already arranged a Jatha of about 150 Singhs, majority of them belonging to the Kamboj [[community]]. All these Singhs came from nearby Kamboj villages of Nizampur Moola Singh wala, Nizampur Chelewala, Dalla Chand Singh, Bohoru, Thothian and Nizam Deva Singh wala etc, all falling in District [[Sheikhupura]] (now [[Pakistan]]).

==Peaceful Khalsa on the march==
The combined Jatha took a Hukamnama and started for the Gurdwara at about 10 PM on that night so as to reach there by early morning at ''[[Amrit Vela|Amrit vela]]'' (nectral hours). On the way 50 more Sikhs joined the ''Shaheedi Jatha'' and total number swelled to about 200.
At Chanderkot Jhal, Jathedar Lachhman Singh decided to wait for Kartar Singh Jhabber and his Jatha. They waited for a while in vain and finally Jathedar Dharowali decided to cancel the plan for further march to Nankana Sahib. But at this very moment, Jathedar Tehal Singh came forward and addressed the Shaheedi Jatha not to vacillate even for a moment from forward march since ''"the prayers having already been said and the action plan having already been decided with Guru's word, it is now imperative for now to move forward"''. Advising further that ''"all the members shall keep cool even under extreme provocations"''. From here-onwards, Jathedar Tehal Singh took over the supreme command of the Shaheedi Jatha and resumed the march to Nankana.&lt;ref&gt;Kamboj Itihaas, 1972, p 183, H. S. Thind; These Kamboj People, 1979, p 277, K. S. Dardi cf [http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/events/nankana.html]&lt;/ref&gt; By almost at ''Amritvela'', the Shaheedi Jatha reached the Railway-crossing near Nankana Sahib. Some of the Jatha members raced towards Darshani Deori to take possession of the Gurdawara, but at this very moment, Chaudhury Paul Singh Lyallpuri showed up ''with the latest decision of Shiromani Committee advising to postpone the action for taking possession of the Gurdwara''. Having conveyed the information, Bhai Paul Singh grabbed Jathedar Lachhman Singh from his waist behind and persuaded him not to proceed further. Once again, Jathedar Tehal Singh took the initiative and shaking Chaudhury Paul Singh forcefully off from the person of Jathedar Lachhman Singh, he once more challenged the Shaheedi Jatha to get ready for the sublime action. He once again spoke: ''" Khalsa ji, the time is not to stop now, but to act. We have come here to achieve martyrdom under Guru's word. This is very un-Sikh-like to backout{{sic}} from one's commitment at the last moment" ''&lt;ref&gt;Kambojas Through the Ages, 2005, p 303, S Kirpal Singh; These Kamboj People, 1979, p 277, K. S. Dardi&lt;/ref&gt; Saying this, Tehal Singh walked with the Jatha towards the Gurdwara. Lachhman Singh and others repeatedly requested him to relent, but Tehal Singh stuck to his [[Ardās]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhstudies.org/Periodicals.asp?TtlCod=811 Sikh Gurdwaras in History and Role of Jhabbar, Karnail Singh See Link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615202825/http://www.sikhstudies.org/Periodicals.asp?TtlCod=811 |date=2007-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Massacre of Khalsa==
Enthused by the speech of Jathedar Tehal Singh, the entire Shaheedi Jatha followed him. By this time, another horseman messenger, Bhai Ram Singh, arrived. In vain did he too try to persuade Jathedar Tehal Singh and the Jatha to return. The Jatha soon entered ''Darshni Deohri'' of the Gurdwara and shut the main door from inside. While some of the devotees took their seats inside the ''Prakash Asthan'', others sat on the platform and the ''Baran dari''. Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali sat on Guru's tabia. Mahant Narayan Das came to know of the situation through the ''Jaikaras'' (victory slogans) of the Shaheedi Jatha. At first, he was utterly shocked thinking that the game was over but he soon recovered and ordered his mercenaries to kill everyone in the Jatha. They fired bullets at the Sangat in Gurdwara hall. Several bullets pierced through [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]]. The hired gundas wielded swords, spears, hatchets and other lethal [[weapon]]s to mercilessly slaughter the peaceful and unprovocative Sikhs within the very premises of the Gurdwara. The dead and dying Singhs were then dragged to a pile of logs which had been collected earlier and consigned to flame. By the time the police and local Sikhs came on the scene, all the dead men had been consumed by the fire. Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali who was wounded with a gunshot was tied to a Jand tree and burnt alive. It was a butchery at its worst form.

The news spread and Sikhs from all parts of Punjab started their march towards [[Nankana Sahib]]. Bhai Kartar Singh Jhabber reached next day with 2200 Singhs armed with shastras (arms). Fearing more trouble, Mr King, [[Commissioner]] [[Lahore]], handed over the keys of Nankana Sahib to Shiromani Committee and arrested Mahant Narayan Das and his Pashtun mercenaries and charged them with murder, but only Das and some of the mercenaries were sentenced to death.

==Statistics on fatalities==
A total of 86 Sikhs officially died.&lt;ref&gt;Shamsher Gurbakash Singh, Shaheedi Jeewan, 1938, p 356; Sher Singh Sher, Glimpsaes of Sikhism and Sikhs, 1982, p 207; H. S. Thind, Kamboj Itihaas, 1971, pp 181- 205.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Giani Partap Singh, out of a total figure of 86 Sikh Shaheeds of Nankana saka, the Kamboj community alone shared 31.&lt;ref&gt;Akali Lehir, pp 104-106, Giani Pratap Singh.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. S. Thind, Kamboj Itihaas, 1971, pp 181-205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirpal Singh, Kambojas Through the Ages, 2005, pp 298-312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S Kirpal Singh, These Kamboj People, 1979, pp 275-279 .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mahatma Gandhi in Nankana Sahib==
[[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited Nankana Sahib on March 3, 1921. Addressing the gathering, Mahatma said: ''"I have come to share your anguish and grief. It is interesting indeed to note that the Sikhs in this drama remained peaceful and non-violent from the start to the end. This (role of the Sikhs) has greatly added to the glory and prestige of [[India]] "''&lt;ref&gt;Sahni Ruchi Ram, Struggle for Reforms in Sikh Shrines (Ed Ganda Singh), p 81&lt;/ref&gt;.....'' "All indications point to the fact that the cruel and [[barbaric]] action is the second edition of [[Amritsar Massacre|Jallianwala Bagh massacre]]; rather more evil and more invidious than even Jallianwala" ''.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, March 11, 1921 (A History of the Sikhs, Vol II, p 200, [[Khushwant Singh]])&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi further spoke: '' "the action of these dimensions could not be perpetrated by Mahant alone. The government officers are also involved in this heinous crime. Where had the authorities gone when the Mahant was making preparations for murderous plans?" ''

==Legacy==
The supreme sacrifices made by these Sikhs Shaheeds have been acknowledged by the grateful nation. From that day onwards, the Sikh nation remembers these brave Sikhs in their daily ardas (prayer). Every year on 21 February at this Shaheedi Asthan, [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib|Guru Granth Sahib]]'s Swaroop with Bullet marks is brought to Deewan (assembly) from 2pm to 4pm for darshan of the Sikh Sangat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4075">'''Noel S. Jacobs''' (1898–1977) was the first and only commander of the Jewish Company of the [[Shanghai Volunteer Corps]].

Born in [[England]] to a Methodist family, he grew up in [[Hong Kong]]. He was a founder-member of the first Boy Scout Troop to be formed in the city. He later served with the Hong Kong Defence Force before moving in the early 1920s to [[Shanghai]], where he was employed by the [[British-American Tobacco Company]]. In Shanghai he met a young Russian-Jewish girl, Dora Bogomolsky, whom he married after converting to [[Judaism]].

Jacobs took over the 5th Shanghai (Jewish) Boy Scout Troop as Scoutmaster in 1923. Under his leadership, the troop flourished and was successfully competitive with the other Scout troops in Shanghai. In the summer of 1932, a group of young Jews in Shanghai, some of them former Scouts as well as members of the Shanghai branch of [[Betar]], met at an obscure address on Bubbling Well Road to consider the possibility of forming a Jewish unit in the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sino-judaic.org/pointseast/seder.html Bernis M. Frank. The Jewish Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. The Sino-Judaic Institute, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1932, following hostilities with the Japanese, a Jewish platoon became a respected unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. It was commanded by Captain Noel S. Jacobs. The chaplain of the Jewish Company was Reverend [[Mendel Brown]], who was the spiritual leader of the [[Sephardic]] community in Shanghai. The platoon expanded on 23 May 1933 to become the all-Jewish Hebrew Company under Jacob’s command. The majority of its members were Russian Jews. The Jewish Company wore on the uniform collar metal [[Magen David]] ornaments with the letters "SVC" superimposed. One of their undeclared aims was to acquire military experience for eventual participation in the fight for Jewish independence in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7QEjPVyd9YMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA156,M1 Encyclopedia of Diasporas. Immigrant and Refugee Cultures Around the World. Vol. I, Jewish Diaspora in China by Xu Xin, p.157, Ember, Melvin; Ember, Carol R.; Skoggard, Ian (Eds.), Springer 2004] {{ISBN|0-306-48321-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the fighting in the Chinese section of Shanghai in 1937 threatened to spill over into the Settlement, the foreign units took up their assigned defensive positions, and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was mobilized on 17 August, as was the Jewish Company, for a period of three months, taking up predesignated stations. For thus period of active service, 85 members of the Company were awarded the Municipal Council's Emergency medal.

Major Jacobs were interned until the end of the war. His wife and three daughters had earlier been evacuated to the United States. In 1949, Jacobs left China to return to England to continue working for the British-American Tobacco Company. He retired in 1956 and he and his family finally settled down in [[New Milton]], England. In 1967, his former Scouts and members of the Jewish Company who had emigrated to Israel sponsored a trip to Israel for Noel and Dora Jacobs. Reportedly, it was an extremely emotional and happy reunion. He died in England in 1977 at the age of 79; his wife a few years later.

To honor their former Scoutmaster and Commander of the Jewish Company, volunteers and friends the world over sponsored a memorial forest in Mod-in, [[Israel]], in his name. A stone marker was unveiled on 18 May 1980 in the presence of a group of these admirers, who had 3,500 trees planted to commemorate the life of Noel Jacobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sino-judaic.org/pointseast/seder.html Bernis M.

'''Padmanabhaswamy Temple''' is located in [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kerala]], [[India]]. The temple is built in an intricate fusion of the indigenous [[Architecture of Kerala|Kerala style]] and the [[Tamil architecture|Tamil style]] (kovil) of architecture associated with the temples located in the neighbouring state of [[Tamil Nadu]], featuring high walls, and a 16th-century [[Gopuram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abram|first=David|title=The Rough Guide to Kerala|publisher=Rough Guides UK|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5sDPbKUaz0C&amp;dq=padmanabhaswamy+temple+style|isbn=9781405388047|date=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; While the ''Moolasthanam'' of the temple is the [[Ananthapura Lake Temple|Ananthapuram Temple]] in  [[Kumbala]] in [[Kasargod District]], architecturally to some extent, the temple is a replica of the [[Adikesava Perumal Temple, Kanyakumari|Adikesava Perumal temple]] located in  [[Thiruvattar]], [[Kanyakumari District]].&lt;ref name="Aswathi"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple|last=Bayi|first=Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bombay, India|year=1995}}&lt;!-- |isbn=1-127-36587-8 ISBN deleted as it appears to not be stated in this book --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The sage Vilvamangalathu Swamiyar, who resided near [[Ananthapura Lake Temple|Ananthapuram Temple]] in Kasargod District, prayed to Lord Vishnu for his ''[[Darśana|darshan]]'' or "auspicious sight". The Lord is believed to have come in the guise of a little boy who was mischievous. The boy defiled the Idol which was kept for Puja. The sage became enraged at this and chased away the boy, who disappeared. After a long search, when he was walking on the banks of Arabian Sea, he heard a ''[[pulaya]]'' lady threatening her child that she would throw him in Ananthankadu. The moment the Swami heard the word Ananthankadu he was delighted. He proceeded to Ananthankadu based on the directions of the lady of whom he enquired. The Sage reached Ananthankadu searching for the boy. There he saw the boy merging into an Iluppa tree (Indian Butter Tree). The tree fell down and became Anantha Sayana Moorti (Vishnu reclining on the celestial snake [[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]]). But the edifice that the Lord assumed was of an extraordinarily large size, with His head at Thiruvallom, navel at Thiruvananthapuram, and lotus-feet at Thrippadapuram (Thrippappur), making him some eight miles in length. The Sage requested the Lord to shrink to a smaller proportion that would be thrice the length of his staff. Immediately the Lord shrank to the form of the Idol that is seen at present in the Temple. But even then many Iluppa trees obstructed a complete vision of the Lord. The Sage saw the Lord in three parts – thirumukham, thiruvudal and thrippadam. Swami prayed to Padmanabha to be forgiven. The Swami offered Rice Kanji and Uppumanga (salted mango pieces) in a coconut shell to the Perumal which he obtained from the pulaya woman. The spot where the Sage had darsan of the Lord belonged to Koopakkara Potti and Karuva Potti. With the assistance of the reigning King and some Brahmin households a Temple was constructed. Koopakkara Potti was made the Tantri of the Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sreepadmanabhaswamytemple.org/History.htm |title=Legend And History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ananthankadu Nagaraja Temple still exists to the north west of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The Samadhi (final resting place) of the Swamiyar exists to the west of the Padmanabha Temple. A Krishna Temple was built over the Samadhi. This Temple, known as Vilvamangalam Sri Krishna Swami Temple, belongs to Thrissur [[Naduvil Madhom]].&lt;ref name="Aswathi" /&gt;

===Travancore royal family===
In the first half of the 18th century, in line with [[Nair|matrilineal customs]], Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]], succeeded his uncle Rama Varma as king at the age of 23. He successfully suppressed the 700-year-old stranglehold of the [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] ("Lords of the Eight Houses") and his cousins following the discovery of conspiracies which the lords were involved in against the royal house of Travancore. The last major renovation of the Padmanabhaswamy temple commenced immediately after Anizham Thirunal's accession to the musnud and the idol was reconsecrated in 906 [[Malayalam calendar|ME]] (1731 AD). On 17 January 1750, Anizham Thirunal surrendered the kingdom of [[Travancore]] to Padmanabha Swamy, the deity at the temple, and pledged that he and his descendants would be vassals or agents of the deity who would serve the kingdom as ''Padmanabha Dasa''.&lt;ref name="Temples of Kerala" /&gt; Since then, the name of every Travancore king was preceded by the title Sree Padmanabha Dasa; the female members of the royal family were called Sree Padmanabha Sevinis. The donation of the kingdom to Padmanabhaswamy was known as Thrippadi-danam. The final wishes of Anizham Thirunal on his passing at the age of 53 clearly delineated the historical relationship between the Maharaja and the temple: "That no deviation whatsoever should be made in regard to the dedication of the kingdom to Padmanabhaswamy and that all future territorial acquisitions should be made over to the Devaswom."

===Main shrine===
In the ''[[sanctum sanctorum]]'', Padmanabha reclines on the serpent ''[[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]] '' or ''Adi Sesha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jayashanker|first1=S|title=Temples of Kerala|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The serpent has five hoods facing inwards, signifying contemplation. The Lord's right hand is placed over a [[Shiva]] [[lingam]]. Sridevi-[[Lakshmi]], the Goddess of Prosperity and [[Bhudevi]] the Goddess of Earth, two consorts of Vishnu are by his side. [[Brahma]] emerges on a lotus, which emanates from the navel of the Lord. The deity is made from 12,008 [[Sila (murti)|saligramams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hatch|first=Emily Gilchriest|title=Travancore|year=1939|edition=Second|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Calcutta|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9OUxAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; These saligrams are from the banks of the [[Gandaki River]] in [[Nepal]], and to commemorate this certain rituals used to be performed at the [[Pashupatinath Temple]].&lt;ref name="Mathrubhumi Aug 12, 2011"&gt;Mathrubhumi, August 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The deity of Padmanabha is covered with, "Katusarkara yogam", a special ayurvedic mix, which forms a plaster that keeps the deity clean. The daily worship is with flowers and for the abhishekam, special deities are used.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

[[File:Modi pst.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi]] at Padmanabhaswamy temple]]
The platforms in front of the [[Vimanam (tower)|vimanam]] and where the deity rests are both carved out of a single massive stone and hence called "Ottakkal-mandapam". On the orders of [[Marthanda Varma]] (1706–58), the Ottakkal-mandapam was cut out of a rock at Thirumala, about {{convert|4|mi}} north of the temple. It measured {{convert|20|ft2|m2 dm2 cm2}} in area by {{convert|2.5|ft|in dm cm}} thick and was placed in front of the deity in the month of Edavom 906 M.E. (1731 CE). At the same time, Marthanda Varma also brought 12,000 [[shaligram]]s, [[aniconism|aniconic]] representations of [[Vishnu]], from the [[Gandaki River]], north of Benares (now known as [[Varanasi]]) to the temple. These were used in the reconsecration of the Padmanabha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Travancore from the Earliest Times|last1=Menon|first1=P. Shungoony|year=1878|publisher=Higginbotham and Co.|location=Madras}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Padmanabhaswamy Temple Gopuram.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Gopuram]] of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple]]
In order to perform [[Darśana|darshan]] and [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]], one has to ascend to the [[mandapa]]m. The Deity is visible through three doors – the visage of the reclining Lord and Siva Linga underneath the hand is seen through the first door; Sridevi and Bhrigu Muni in Katusarkara, Brahma seated on a lotus emanating from the Lord's navel, hence the name, "Padmanabha", gold abhisheka moorthies of Lord Padmanabha, Sridevi and Bhudevi, and silver utsava moorthi of Padmanabha through the second door; the Lord's feet, and Bhudevi and Markandeya Muni in Katusarkara through the third door. The idols of two goddesses holding chamaram, [[Garuda]], [[Narada]], [[Tumburu]], the divine forms of the six weapons of Lord Vishnu, [[Surya]], [[Chandra]], [[Saptarshi]] (Seven Sages), Madhu, and Kaitabha are also there in the Sanctum. Only the King of Travancore may perform sashtanga namaskaram, or prostrate on the "Ottakkal Mandapam". It is traditionally held that anybody who prostrates on the mandapam has surrendered all that he possesses to the Deity. Since the ruler has already done that, he is permitted to prostrate on this mandapam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Writer with a royal lineage|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/history-and-culture/article2455596.ece|accessdate=15 September 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=15 September 2011|location=Chennai, India|first=Kausalya|last=Santhanam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other shrines===
Inside the Temple, there are two other important shrines, Thekkedom and Thiruvambadi, for the Deities, [[Narasimha|Ugra Narasimha]] and [[Krishna]] Swami respectively. Thiruvambadi shrine enjoys an independent status and predates the shrine of Padmanabha. Thiruvambadi shrine has its own namaskara mandapam, bali stones and flagmast. The Lord of Thiruvambadi is Parthasarathi, the Divine Charioteer of [[Arjuna]]. The granite idol of the Lord of Thiruvambadi was brought from Gujarat by 72 families of Vrishni Vamsa Kshatriyas. As these Vrishnies belong to the lineage of Lord Krishna, they are known as Krishnan vakakkar. The two-armed granite idol, with one hand holding the whip and the other resting on the left thigh holding the conch close to it, is in standing posture. On [[Ekadasi]] days the Lord is dressed and decorated as [[Mohini]]. There are also shrines for [[Rama]] accompanied by [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]] and [[Hanuman]], Vishwaksena (the Nirmalyadhari of Vishnu and Remover of Obstacles), [[Vyasa]], [[Ganapati]], [[Sasta]], and Kshetrapala (who guards the temple). Grand idols of [[Garuda]] and Hanuman stand with folded hands in the Valiya balikkal area.&lt;ref name="Aswathi" /&gt; The thevara idols of Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma and [[Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma]] are housed in the south east part of the Temple.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

The temple has a corridor with 365 and one-quarter sculptured granite-stone pillars with elaborate carvings which stands out to be an ultimate testimonial for the [[Vishwakarma]] sthapathis in sculpting this architectural masterpiece. This corridor extends from the eastern side into the sanctum sanctorum. An {{convert|80|ft|adj=on}} flagstaff stands in front of the main entry from the ''[[prakaram]]''(closed precincts of a temple). The ground floor under the gopuram (main entrance in the eastern side) is known as the 'Nataka Sala' where the famous temple art [[Kathakali]] was staged in the night during the ten-day ''uthsavam'' (festival) conducted twice a year, during the [[Malayalam calendar#Months|Malayalam months]] of Meenam and Thulam.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

==Temple rituals==
===Festivals and rites===
[[File:Aaratu1.jpg|thumb|Narasimha Swamy and Padmanabha Swamy after coming from Shankumuka Beach during Aarat Festival]]
There are many festivals related to this temple. The major festivals are bi-annual. The ''Alpashy'' festival which is in October/November and the ''[[Panguni Uthiram|Panguni]]'' festival which is in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] month Panguni, March/April, lasts for 10 days each. On the ninth day the Maharajah of Travancore, in his capacity as Thrippappoor Mooppan, escorts the deities to the vettakkalam for Pallivetta. Centuries back, the Pallivetta procession was said to pass through Kaithamukku, Kuthiravattom (Kunnumpuram), [[Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple|Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram]] and Putharikkandam. The festivals culminate with the ''Aarat'' (holy bath) procession to the [[Shankumugham Beach]]. The word ''Aarat'' refers to the purificatory immersion of the deities of the temple in sea. This event takes place in the evening. The Maharajah of Travancore escorts the ''Aarat'' procession on foot. The festival idols "Utsava Vigrahas" of Padmanabhaswamy, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami are given a ritual bath in the sea, after the prescribed [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]s. After this ceremony, the idols are taken back to the temple in a procession that is lit by traditional torches, marking the conclusion of the festival.&lt;ref name="Aswathi" /&gt;

A major annual festival related to Padmanabha temple is the ''[[Navaratri]]'' festival. The idols of [[Saraswati]] Amman, Mun Uditha Nangai ([[Parasakti]] who appeared before Saraswati, [[Lakshmi]] and Parvati to help them identify their husbands who had been transformed into infants by the power of chastity of [[Anasuya]]) and Kumara Swami ([[Murugan]]) are brought to the ''Kuthira malika'' palace in front of Padmanabha temple as a procession. This festival lasts for 9 days. The famous Swathi music festival is held every year during this festival.

[[File:Aaratu3.jpg|thumb|upright|Big idol of Pandavas displayed during Panguni festival]]

The biggest festival in this temple is ''laksha deepam'', which means hundred thousand (or one [[lakh]]) lamps. This festival is unique and commences once in 6 years. Prior to this festival, chanting of prayers and recitation of three [[vedas]] is done for 56 days (Murajapam). On the last day, hundred thousand oil lamps are lit in and around the temple premises. The next ''laksha deepam'' is slated in January 2020.

===Priests===
Temples where 'Swamiyar Pushpanjali' is conducted are claimants to extra sanctity. Sannyasins from any one of the monasteries founded by the disciples of [[Adi Sankara]] in Thrissur do pushpanjali (flower worship) daily to Padmanabha, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami.
Of these monasteries, [[Naduvil Madhom]] is the most important as Vilvamangalathu Swamiyar, the founder of this Temple, belonged to this monastery. Initially, Koopakkara Potties were the Tantries of the Temple. Later, Tantram was transferred to Tharananallur Nambuthiripads of Iranjalakkuda. The Nambies, altogether four in number, are the Chief Priests of the Temple. Two Nambies - [[Periya Nambi]] and Panchagavyathu Nambi - are allotted to Padmanabha and one Nambi each to Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. The Nambies hail from either side of the Chandragiri River. They are appointed by the Pushpanjali Swamiyar.&lt;ref name="Aswathi" /&gt;

==Temple management==
The Padmanabhaswamy Temple and its property were controlled by the [[Ettara Yogam]] (King's Council of Eight) with the assistance of [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] ("Lords of the Eight Houses"). The Ettara Yogam consists of Pushpanjali Swamiyar, six member Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha, Sabhanjithan (Secretary) and Arachan (Maharaja of Travancore). Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha was primarily responsible for the administration of the Temple. Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti and Neythasseri Potti are the members of the Sabha. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar presides over the meetings of the Sabha. Sreekaryathu Potti is the Sabhanjithan of the Sabha.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram Charithra Rekhakalilude by S. Uma Maheswari&lt;/ref&gt; Any decision taken by the Sabha can be implemented only if the Maharaja of Travancore approves of it.&lt;ref&gt;Charithram Kuricha Sree Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram by Dr MG Sasibhooshan and Dr RP Raja&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, only the Swamiyars of the [[Naduvil Madhom]] were appointed as Pushpanjali Swamiyars by the [[Maharaja of Travancore]]. Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]] curtailed the authority of Ettara Yogam and liquidated the powerful Ettuveetil Pillamar. Ettara Yogam became an advisory and assenting body thereafter. Besides Naduvil Madhom, Munchira Madhom got the right to appoint Pushpanjali Swamiyars during his reign. In the recent past, [[Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma]] gave Pushpanjali rights to the Swamiyars of Thrikkaikattu Madhom and Thekke Madhom as well. Though the Maharaja is the appointing authority of the Pushpanjali Swamiyar, the former must do a Vechu Namaskaram when he sees the Swamiyar. With the passing away of Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma in December 2013, his nephew [[Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma]] became the titular Maharaja of Travancore in January 2014. Like his predecessors, Moolam Thirunal also got concurrence from the Ettara Yogam before assuming the title 'Maharaja'. In the presence of the Maharaja designate, the Yogathil Pottimar and the Tantri, the Pushpanjali Swamiyar Maravanchery Thekkedathu Neelakanta Bharatikal signed on the Neettu (Order) of the Ettara Yogam accepting Moolam Thirunal as ''Chirava Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Maharaja of Travancore) and ''Thrippappoor Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Protector of the Temple). This ceremony took place at Kulasekhara Mandapam in Padmanabha Swamy Temple. [[Revathi Thirunal Balagopal Varma]], grandson of Maharani Regent Pooradom Thirunal [[Sethu Lakshmi Bayi]], is the titular Elayaraja of Travancore.

==Extant temple records==
A pertinent event in the long recorded history of the temple was the construction of a "granta-pura" (record-room) within the temple compound itself around 1425 A.D. by the then Venad King Veera Iravi Iravi Varma, to store the "Mathilakam" (within-the-walls) records, as the then existing temple records were known.&lt;ref name="frontline.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2815/stories/20110729281512800.htm|title=Key to the past|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major portion of those records (numbering around 30 lakhs of documents) from the Mathikalam, had been donated later to the Archives Department in 1867, at the time of the formation of the latter. Despite their cultural value, only a minuscule portion of these grantas (bundles) of cadjan leaf records, written mostly in ancient scripts of proto-[[Tamil script|Tamil]] and archaic-Malayalam, have been deciphered. The translations of this section of manuscripts by some scholars serve as a rare but very inadequate primary source material on the temple and its rich traditions.

The rest of the 30 lakh documents – three thousand bundles of records pertaining to the temple - each bundle consisting of over a thousand cadjan records – segregated under 70 "heads" - is still lying idle with the Archives Department. According to Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi Bayi, a member of the Travancore Royal Family and author of a book on the temple, from a very early period in recorded history the temple had employed two kinds of 'record writers'. One group was to record the proceedings and transactions of the Ettarayogam, a council of temple administrators, that included the then king. The other was to write and preserve the records of the day-to-day functioning of the temple, maintain correct accounts of the temple-treasury, and of temple-revenue-collections and temple-expenditure, and as well as write down all the other records, connected with the functioning of the temple.

==Temple assets==
{{wikinews|Hidden treasure worth billions of dollars discovered in Indian temple}}
The temple and its assets belong to Lord Padmanabhaswamy, and were for a long time controlled by a trust, headed by the [[Travancore royal family|Travancore Royal family]]. However, for the present, the Supreme Court of India has divested the Travancore Royal Family from leading the management of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-rs-90000-crore-found-in-kerala-temple-belongs-to-lord-vishnu/20110706.htm Kerala government has no right over the wealth], 6 July 2011, rediff.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toi8jul&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-07-08/india/29751405_1_ancient-temple-royal-family-centuries-old-temple SC halts opening of Kerala temple's last vault], TNN &amp; Agencies 8 Jul 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Apex-court-restrains-opening-of-Kerala-temple-vault/815094/ Apex court restrains opening of Kerala temple vault] Express news service, Sat 9 Jul 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-07-09/india/29754934_1_temple-riches-devotees-venugopal Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple treasure belongs to deity: Royal family {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=BlevintronBot}}, TNN, 9 Jul 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[T P Sundararajan]]'s litigations changed the way the world looked at the Temple.

While vault B has been unopened over centuries, A was possibly opened in the 1930s, and vaults C to F have been opened from time to time over recent years. The two priests of the temple, the 'Periya Nambi' and the 'Thekkedathu Nambi', are the custodians of the four vaults, C to F, which are opened periodically. The Supreme Court had directed that "the existing practices, procedures, and rituals" of the temple be followed while opening vaults C to F and using the articles inside, while Vaults A and B would be opened only for the purpose of making an inventory of the articles and then closed. The review of the temple's underground vaults was undertaken by a seven-member panel appointed by the [[Supreme Court of India]] to generate an inventory, leading to the enumeration of a vast collection of articles that are traditionally kept under lock and key. A detailed inventory of the temple assets, consisting of gold, jewels, and other valuables is yet to be made.

These estimates were on the basis of the revelations since July 2011, when five vaults were opened, with the at least one remaining vault (B), which is the largest, still closed. One of the oldest existing estimates regarding Vault B, which can be considered to be at least as reliable as any other made since the discovery of the hidden treasure (or assets) of the Temple in 2011, was by the Travancore Royal Family itself in the 1880s (when an older existing estimate was updated). According to it, the gold and precious stones contained in Vault B, which is by far the largest and the only vault (of the reported six) that is unopened so far, since the discovery of the treasure, were worth {{INRConvert|12000|c}}. Considering the subsequent inflation of the rupee, and the increase in the prices of gold and precious metals and precious stones since in general, the treasure in the unopened vault B alone, would be worth at least {{INRConvert|50|t}} in present-day terms, without the cultural value being factored in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/kerala-temple-may-reveal-more-riches/1/144004.html|title=Kerala's Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple may reveal more riches|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimdobson/2015/11/13/a-one-trillion-dollar-hidden-treasure-chamber-is-discovered-at-indias-sree-padmanabhaswam-temple/#2594055d1ba6&lt;/ref&gt; As a reference, the entire GDP (revenues in all forms) of the [[Mughal Empire]] at its very zenith under [[Aurangzeb]] (in 1690), was a comparatively meagre US$90 billion in modern-day terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2277%2F0521251192|title=The Mughal Empire - Cambridge University Press|publisher=|doi=10.2277/0521251192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Ygz9VbiE0|title=YouTube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, at its richest, the Mughal "treasury" (in Akbar's and Jahangir's and Shah Jahan's periods) consisted of seven tonnes of gold, along with eighty pounds of uncut diamonds, a hundred pounds each of rubies and emeralds and six hundred pounds of pearls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030413/spectrum/heritage.htm|title=The Sunday Tribune - Spectrum - Heritage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in contrast, the wealthiest [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], [[Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII]], was worth a relatively minuscule {{INRConvert|600|c}} (all his conceivable assets combined) in the 1940s, while his entire treasure of jewels, would be worth between US$150 Million and US$500 million variously in today's terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,868973,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|title=INDIA: The Nizam's Daughter|date=19 January 1959|website=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Priceless-Nizam-jewels-to-be-exhibited/articleshow/1492626431.cms|title=Priceless Nizam jewels to be exhibited|website=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ia.rediff.com/news/2000/dec/11jafri.htm?h=splitinfinity&amp;d=get&amp;sony|title=rediff.com: Hyderabad museum to exhibit Nizam's jewels|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/exhibition-of-jewels-of-hyderabad-nizams-includes-fifth-largest-diamond-in-world/1/231098.html|title=Exhibition of jewels of Hyderabad Nizams includes fifth-largest diamond in world|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hitherto-uncovered treasure itself is worth millions of times that of the British crown jewels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dreamhomesmagazine.com/digitalmag/LJV/16/data/search.xml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-lies-beneath/article1-719314.aspx|title=What lies beneath|website=www.hindustantimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with only the five smaller of the reported eight vaults being opened (the larger three vaults and all their ante-chambers still remaining closed), the treasure found so far, is considered to be by far the largest collection of items of gold and fully precious stones in the recorded history of the world.&lt;ref name="bullionstreet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bullionstreet.com/news/india-to-evaluate-worlds-largest-gold-treasure-soon/1044|title=India to evaluate world's largest gold treasure soon|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414100931/http://www.bullionstreet.com/news/india-to-evaluate-worlds-largest-gold-treasure-soon/1044|archivedate=14 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commodityonline.com/news/gold-treasure-at-india-temple-could-be-the-largest-in-the-world-40475-3-40476.html|title=Gold treasure at India temple could be the largest in the world|website=www.commodityonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The valuables are believed to have been accumulated in the temple over several thousand years, having been donated to the Deity (and subsequently stored there), by various Dynasties like the [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]], the [[Pandya Kingdom|Pandyas]], the [[Travancore Royal Family]], the [[Mushika Kingdom|Kolathiris]], the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]], the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]] and many other Kings in the recorded history of both South India and beyond, and from the rulers and traders of Mesopotamia, Jerusalem, Greece, Rome, and later, the various colonial powers from Europe, and other countries as well.&lt;ref name="thehindu.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rediff.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frontline.in"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tales-that-the-fabulous-collection-in-the-vaults-tell/article2233694.ece|title=Tales that the fabulous collection in the vaults tell|author=Beena Sarasa|website=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frontline.in1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2815/stories/20110729281512500.htm|title=Treasures of history|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="commodityonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commodityonline.com/news/temple-treasure-do-gods-need-gold-40506-3-40507.html|title=Temple Treasure: Do gods need gold?|website=www.commodityonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people have suggested that a part of the stored riches reached the Travancore kings in the later years in the form of tax as well as conquered wealth of other South Indian kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Glittering details emerge of Indian temple treasure |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/life/Glittering+details+emerge+Indian+temple+treasure/5051341/story.html |accessdate=18 July 2011 |newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)]] |date=5 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708181423/http://www.montrealgazette.com/life/Glittering+details+emerge+Indian+temple+treasure/5051341/story.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars however believe that this was accumulated over thousands of years, given the mention of the Deity and the Temple in several extant Hindu Texts, the Sangam Tamil literature (500 BC to 300 AD wherein it was referred to as the "Golden Temple" on account of its then unimaginable wealth), and the treasures consist of countless artifacts dating back to the Chera, Pandya and Greek and Roman epochs. The ancient late-Tamil-Sangam epic [[Silappatikaram]] (c 100 AD to 300 AD at the latest) speaks of the then Chera King Cenkuttuvan receiving gifts of gold and precious stones from a certain 'Golden Temple' (Arituyil-Amardon) which is believed to be the Pasmanabhaswamy Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WQ5XAAAAMAAJ|title=Seran Vanji: Vanji, the Capital of the Cheras|last=Aiyangar|first=Sakkottai Krishnaswami|date=1940-01-01|publisher=Superintendent, Cochin Government Press|page=29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k57RAAAAMAAJ|title=The Secret Chamber: A Historical, Anthropological &amp; Philosophical Study of the Kodungallur Temple|last=Induchudan|first=V.

The Malabar region (as a part of the "Tamilakam" region of recorded history) had several centers of trade and commerce since the Sumerian Period ranging from Vizhinjam in the South to Mangalore in the North. Also, at times like the invasion by Tipu Sultan, the other then related royal families (of the Travancore Royal Family) in Kerala and the extreme Southern region (like the Kolathiris), took refuge in Thiruvananthapuram, and stored their temple-wealth for safekeeping in the Padmanabhaswamy Temple.&lt;ref name="thehindu.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rediff.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frontline.in"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frontline.in1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commodityonline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/why-sree-padmanabhaswamy-temple-s-mysterious-vault-b-should-be-opened-expert-explains-65521&lt;/ref&gt; Also, much of the treasures housed in the much larger and as-yet-unopened vaults, as well as in the much smaller cellars that have been opened, date back to long before the institution of the so-called Travancore Kingdom, e.g. the {{cvt|800|kg}} hoard of gold coins from 200 B.C that was mentioned by [[Vinod Rai]]. Noted archaeologist and historian [[R. Nagaswamy]] has also stated that several records exist in Kerala, of offerings made to the Deity, from several parts of Kerala.&lt;ref name="thehindu.com"/&gt; Lastly, it has to be remembered that in the Travancore Kingdom, a distinction was always made between the Government (State) Treasury (Karuvelam), the Royal Family Treasury (Chellam), and the Temple Treasury (Thiruvara Bhandaram or Sri Bhandaram). During the reign of Maharani [[Gowri Lakshmi Bayi]], hundreds of temples that were mismanaged in the Kerala region, were brought under the Government. The excess ornaments in these temples were also transferred to the Vaults of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. Instead the funds of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple were utilised for the daily upkeep of these temples.

On 4 July 2011 the seven-member expert team tasked with taking stock of the temple assets decided to postpone opening of Chamber 'B'. This chamber is sealed with an iron door with the image of a cobra on it and it has not been opened, due to the belief opening it would result in much misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hayes|first=S|title=The Forgotten and Cursed Billion Treasure Trove Discovered Beneath Indian Temple|url=http://newsflavor.com/world/asia/the-forgotten-and-cursed-22-billion-treasure-trove-discovered-beneath-indian-temple/|accessdate=18 July 2011|newspaper=NewsFlavor|date=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The royal family said that many legends were attached to the temple and that chamber B has a model of a snake on the main door and opening it could be a bad omen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Legend halts Kerala temple stocktaking|url=http://www.asianage.com/india/legend-halts-kerala-temple-stocktaking-150|accessdate=18 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Asian Age]]|date=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seven-member team will consult with some more experts on 8 July 2011 and then they may take the final decision on opening of chamber 'B'.&lt;ref name="Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple: Lord's riches worth more than Rs 1 lakh cr"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-07-05/news/29739016_1_market-value-Sree-padmanabha-swamy-treasure-trove|title=Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple: Lord's riches worth more than Rs 1 lakh cr|author=TNN|date=5 July 2011|publisher=The Economic Times|accessdate=5 July 2011|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Ashtamangala Devaprasnam conducted in the Temple to discern the will of the Lord revealed that any attempts to open Chamber 'B' would cause Divine displeasure and that the holy articles in the other chambers were defiled in the inventorying process.&lt;ref name="Mathrubhumi Aug 12, 2011"/&gt; The original petitioner whose court action led to the inventory taking, T.P.

This was possibly an antechamber of any of the Vaults A or C or D or E or F that may not have been opened yet. This was necessitated due to the severe economic depression that India was going through as was the entire world. The Palace and State Treasuries had run almost dry. The small group of people including the King and the priests found a granary-sized structure almost full with mostly gold and some silver coins and jewels. Surmounted on top of it were hundreds of pure gold pots. There were four coffers filled with gold coins as well. Also found was a larger chest fixed to the ground with six sections in it. They were full of gold jewelry encrusted with diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds. Besides these, were four more chests of old coins (not of gold), and they were carried back to the Palace and State Treasuries for counting from.&lt;ref name="a.srivathsan"/&gt;

===Vault (Kallara) B, the forbidden zone===
The Bhagavata Purana says that Lord [[Balarama]] visited  Phalgunam (more commonly known as Thiruvananthapuram), took bath in Panchapsaras (Padmateertham) and made a gift of ten thousand cows to holy men.&lt;ref&gt;"Srimad Bhagavata" (Page 381 of Volume Three). Translated by Swami Tapasyananda. Published by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai&lt;/ref&gt; Though the sannidhyam of Lord Padmanabha has always been present in the holy land of Thiruvananthapuram making it a pilgrim spot even during the time of Balarama, the present-day Temple for the Lord came up later. The southwest part of the Chuttambalam was constructed at the holy spot where Lord Balarama is believed to have donated cows to holy men. This portion came to be known as Mahabharatakonam and covered the ground underneath which both Kallara B and Kallara A were situated.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of His Holiness the Pushpanjali Swamiyar to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a popular legend, many Devas and Sages devoted to Lord Balarama visited Him on the banks of Padmateertham. They requested Him that they may be permitted to reside there worshipping the Lord. Balarama granted them their wish. It is believed that these Devas and Sages reside in Kallara B worshipping the Lord. [[Nāga|Naga]] Devathas devoted to the Lord also dwell in this Kallara.&lt;ref&gt;"Sri Padmanabho Rakshatu" by G Sekharan Nair, Mathrubhumi, Thiruvananthapuram Edition dated September 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kanjirottu Yakshi]], whose enchanting and ferocious forms are painted on the south-west part of the main Sanctum, resides in this Kallara worshipping Lord Narasimha.&lt;ref&gt;Bayi, Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi. 'Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple' (Third Edition). Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Holy objects like Sreechakram were installed beneath this Kallara to enhance the potency of the Principal Deity. Lord Ugra [[Narasimha]] of Thekkedom is said to be the Protector of Kallara B. There is a serpent's image on Kallara B indicating danger to anyone who opens it. A four-day [[Ashtamangala prasnam|Ashtamangala Devaprasnam]] conducted in August 2011 declared Kallara B as "forbidden zone".&lt;ref name="The Hindu dated July 7, 2011"&gt;The Hindu dated July 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the antechamber to Kallara B was opened by the Observers appointed by the Supreme Court of India.&lt;ref&gt;The Hindu dated June 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; But the Observers could not open Kallara B. However, Gopal Subramanium in his report submitted to the Supreme Court in April 2014, recommended its opening after conducting another Devaprasnam. The two Pushpanjali Swamiyars are the highest spiritual dignitaries of Padmanabha Swamy Temple. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar of Naduvil Madhom sent letters to the Chairperson of the Administrative Committee and the Executive Officer on February 8, 2016 expressing his strong opposition to the opening of Kallara B.&lt;ref&gt;Mathrubhumi, Thiruvananthapuram Edition dated February 26, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The Pushpanjali Swamiyar of Munchira Madhom led a Ratha Yathra from Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuram in May 2018 campaigning against opening the sacred Kallara. [[Azhvanchery Thamprakkal]], the supreme spiritual leader of Kerala Brahmins, while addressing a meeting held in connection with the Ratha Yathra also demanded that faith should not be trampled upon by opening Kallara B.&lt;ref&gt;Mathrubhumi and Malayala Manorama, Thiruvananthapuram Edition dated May 14, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

According to folklore, Padmanabhan Thampi, arch rival of Anizhom Thirunal Marthanda Varma, marched to Thiruvananthapuram with his forces and tried to loot the vaults of the Temple. Thampi stayed at Sri Varaham and sent his mercenaries to Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple. It is said that divine serpents materialised in hundreds and scared away Thampi's men. Emboldened by this heavenly intervention, [[Pallichal Pillai]] and local people opposed Padmanabhan Thampi and ensured that the mercenaries did not proceed with the misadventure.

It is highly unlikely that Kallara B was opened after the 1880s. An article by Emily Gilchrist,  a visiting Englishwoman in the 1933, recalls in her book 'Travancore: A Guide Book for the Visitor' (Oxford University Press, 1933) about an unsuccessful attempt to open one Kallara in 1908: "About 25 years ago, when the State needed additional money, it was thought expedient to open these chests and use the wealth they contained." "A group of people" got together and attempted to enter the vaults with torches. When they found the vaults  "infested with cobras" they "fled for their lives.&lt;ref name="a.srivathsan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/when-the-vault-was-opened-in-1931/article2201786.ece|title=When the vault was opened in 1931|author=A. Srivathsan|website=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by former Comptroller and Auditor General of India [[Vinod Rai]], Kallara B has been opened a number of times in recent decades: twice in 1991 and five times in 2002. Once Vinod Rai's report was out, Princess [[Aswathi Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi]] clarified that Mr Rai was referring to the antechamber to Kallara B, which was opened even in 2011 by the Supreme Court-appointed observers.&lt;ref&gt;Malayala Manorama Daily, August 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kerala High Court ruled in 2011 that the state government should take over the control of the temple and its assets, but the Travancore royal family appealed to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="econ"&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2013/02/temples-riches Temple Riches: Render unto Padmanabhaswamy] - The Economist, 19 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; An independent report was commissioned, and was completed in November 2012,&lt;ref name="sci"&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/multimedia/archive/01262/Report_of_the_amic_1262649a.pdf Supreme Court of India, in the matter of Sri Marthanda Varma v [[T P Sundararajan]] AND [[Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma]] v Union of India] - November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; finding no evidence that the royal family were expropriating the treasures.&lt;ref name="econ" /&gt;

As of end-April 2016, vaults B, G, and H along with their several ante-chambers were yet to be opened; while inventorying of the items in vaults C, D, E, and F were completed (in August 2012) and formal inventorying of vault A had commenced.&lt;ref name="thehindu.com1"/&gt; Several hundred pots and other items made of gold, that are used for daily rituals or intermittently for ceremonies in the Temple, were not inventoried as the Temple-priests expressed strong objections.&lt;ref name="thehindu.com1"/&gt; Over 1.02 lakh 'articles' had been retrieved from Vault A and its ante-chambers, till that point, though only a small part of them had been inventoried then.

In April 2014, [[Amicus Curiae]] advocate [[Gopal Subramaniam]] filed a 577-page report to the [[Supreme court of India]] alleging malpractices in the administration of the temple. According to him, the authorities failed to perform their ethical duties by opening many bank accounts, trusts and also not filing Income Tax returns for the past ten years. He alleged that Vault B was opened despite a previous ruling of the Supreme court prohibiting the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apex court finds amicus curiae report on temple disturbing|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/apex-court-finds-amicus-curiae-report-on-temple-disturbing/article5940660.ece?ref=relatedNews|accessdate=24 April 2014|newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report states, "The large amount of gold and silver, the discovery of which was a shock to the Amicus Curiae, is a singular instance of mismanagement. The presence of a gold plating machine is also yet another unexplained circumstance. This discovery raises a doubt of the organized extraction by persons belonging to the highest echelons. There appears to be resistance on the part of the entire State apparatus in effectively addressing the said issues.

The CBI and the Intelligence Bureau have red-flagged the appointment of Gopal Subramaniam as a Judge in the Supreme Court. The IB cites Mr Subramaniam's report on Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple as one of the instances where he relied heavily on his spiritual instincts rather than rational logic and hard facts.&lt;ref name="The Economic Times, June 25, 2014"&gt;The Economic Times, June 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In his second report on Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple, Mr Subramaniam himself reveals,"It was his morning ritual of [shutting] his mind and seeking guidance, which resulted in discoveries in this direction."&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Amicus Curiae, Pg 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amicus Curiae has also been accused of conducting poojas in the Temple in violation of its customs.&lt;ref name="The Economic Times, June 25, 2014"/&gt; He performed poojas at the Thevarappura in the Temple and in front of the Vedavyasa Shrine. Despite opposition from the Royal Family and the Tantries of the Temple, he pulled out a stone Yantra from the nearby Marthandan Madhom Palace and did pooja on it for several days. The Tantries explained that the Yantram had no connection with the Padmanabhaswami Temple and that it was for the protection of the Palace. But the Amicus Curiae insisted on having it installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Temple. Due to severe opposition from the Tantries the Yantram remains where it was. Every morning, Lord Padmanabha is to be awakened only by blowing the conch shell and chanting the Sripada Sooktham. But the Amicus Curiae introduced the daily rendering of Venkatesa Suprabhatam to awaken the Lord. The Supreme Court requested the Tantri to take the final decision on whether the Suprabhatam could be sung. Following that, the Senior Tantri Nedumpilli Tharananalloor Parameswaran Namboothiripad directed the Temple authorities to stop the chanting of Suprabhatam forthwith as it was causing 'Anya Mantra Yajana Dosham' (affliction due to worshipping the Deity with incompatible mantras) to the Presiding Deity and the Temple. As atonement for this dosham, the Tantri wants Vedic scholars to chant 12 'muras' each of Rig Veda and Yajur Veda. In his first report to the Supreme Court, the Amicus Curiae directed the Tantries to examine whether a [[Sri Yantra]] can be installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum, in front of the utsava moorthi.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Amicus Curiae, Pg 63&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33799">'''Mythology''' is the [[myth and ritual|main component]] of '''Religion'''. It refers to systems of concepts that are of high importance to a certain community, making statements concerning the [[supernatural]] or [[sacred]]. Religion is the broader term, besides mythological system, it includes [[ritual]]. A given [[mythology]] is almost always associated with a certain religion such as [[Greek mythology]] with [[Ancient Greek religion]]. Disconnected from its religious system, a myth may lose its immediate relevance to the community and evolve—away from sacred importance—into a [[legend]] or [[Folklore|folktale]]. 

There is a complex relationship between [[myth and ritual|recital of myths and enactment of rituals]].

==Introduction==
{{See also|Myth and ritual}}
The relationship between religion and myth depends on what definition of "myth" one uses. By [[Robert Graves]]'s definition, a religion's [[Traditional story|traditional stories]] are "myths" if and only if one does not belong to the religion in question. By Segal's definition, all religious stories are myths—but simply because nearly all [[Narrative|stories]] are myths. By the [[Folklore studies|folklorists]]' definition, all myths are religious (or "sacred") stories, but not all religious stories are myths: religious stories that involve the [[Creation myth|creation of the world]] (e.g., the stories in the [[Book of Genesis]]) are myths; however, some religious stories that don't explain how things came to be in their present form (e.g., [[Hagiography|hagiographies]] of famous [[saint]]s) are not myths. Generally, mythology is the main component of religion alongside ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=KERYGMA AND MYTH by Rudolf Bultmann and Five Critics edited by Hans Werner Bartsch |last=Bultmann |first=Rudolf |year=2005 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |url=https://www.religion-online.org/book-chapter/the-mythological-element-in-the-message-of-the-new-testament-and-the-problem-of-its-re-interpretation-part-i/ |page=21}}: "The cosmology of the New Testament is essentially mythical in character."&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|1={{harvnb|Rue|2005|pp=315}}: religious traditions are, essentially, mythic traditions}}{{refn|1={{harvnb|Rue|2005|pp=144-145}}: "At the core of every religious tradition there is found a narrative vision, a myth unifying ultimate reality and value, a story that is expressed, transmitted, and revitalized by a variety of ancillary strategies."}}{{refn|1={{harvnb|Leeming|2005|loc=Introduction, xi}}: "Religious stories are “holy scripture” to believers — narratives used to support, explain, or justify a particular system’s rituals, theology, and ethics — and are myths to people of other cultures or belief systems."}}{{refn|1={{harvnb|Gieysztor|1982|p=5}}: "Przez mitologię, stanowiącą część główną religii, rozumiemy system personifikacji, alegorii i symboliki, które wyrażały stosunek człowieka do świata. "}} For example, in the [[Early modern Europe|early modern period]], distinguished Christian theologians developed elaborated witch mythologies which contributed to the intensification of [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch trials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levack |first1=Brian P. |title=The Oxford Handbook of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=48-49 |isbn=0-19-515669-2 |url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=Lum96_FPZp0C&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Oxford Companion to World Mythology'' provides the following summary and examples:{{sfn|Leeming|2005|loc=Introduction}}{{sfn|Leeming|2005|loc=Religion and Myth}}&lt;blockquote&gt;Religious stories are “holy scripture” to believers—narratives used to support, explain, or justify a particular system’s rituals, theology, and ethics—and are myths to people of other cultures or belief systems. […] It&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;difficult to believe that the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] was [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|conceived in a dream by a white elephant]], so we call that story a myth as well. But, of course, stories such as the [[Crossing the Red Sea|parting of the Sea of Reeds]] for the fleeing [[Israelites|Hebrews]], [[Muhammad]]’s [[Isra and Mi'raj|Night Journey]], and the dead [[Resurrection of Jesus|Jesus rising from the tomb]] are just as clearly [[Irrationality|irrational]] narratives to which a [[Hindu]] or a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] might understandably apply the word “myth.” All of these stories are definable as myths because they contain events that contradict both our intellectual and physical experience of [[reality]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most definitions of "myth" limit myths to stories.&lt;ref&gt;Segal 2004, p. 5. See Buxton, p. 18: "There are three elements in [my] definition [of mythology]. '''The least problematic''' is the notion of ''story'': a 'myth' is a narrative, a set of events structured into a sequence". (Bolding added)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, non-narrative elements of religion, such as ritual, are not myths.
===Theology and myth===
The term [[theology]] for the first time appears in the writings of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. Initially, theology and mythology were synonymous. With time, both terms gained distinctive qualities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica |title=Theology |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/theology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818084404/https://www.britannica.com/topic/theology |archive-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the first place, theology is a spiritual or religious attempt of “believers” to explicate their faith. In this sense it is not neutral and is not attempted from the perspective of removed observation—in contrast to a general history of religions. The implication derived from the religious approach is that it does not provide a formal and indifferent scheme devoid of presuppositions within which all religions could be subsumed. In the second place, theology is influenced by its origins in the Greek and Christian traditions, with the implication that the transmutation of this concept to other religions is endangered by the very circumstances of origination.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Hege, both primitive and modern theology is inescapably constrained by its mythical backbone:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hege |first=Brent A. R.|title=Myth, History, and the Resurrection in German Protestant Theology |year=2017 |p=132 |url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=SSA6DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Hermeneutics|Hermeneutically]], theologians must recognize that mythical thought permeates the [[Bible|biblical texts]]. [[Dogma|Dogmatically]], theologians must be aware of the mythological elements of theology and of how extensively theology relies on mythical forms and functions, especially in light of our awareness of the ubiquity of myth.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Religion===
''[[Religion]]'' is a belief concerning the supernatural, sacred, or [[Divinity|divine]], and the [[moral code]]s, practices, values, and institutions associated with such belief, although some scholars, such as Durkheim, would argue that the supernatural and the divine are not aspects of all religions.&lt;ref&gt;"Religion", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious beliefs and practices may include the following: a [[deity]] or higher being, [[eschatology]], practices of [[worship]], practices of [[ethics]] and [[politics]]. Some religions do not include all these features. For instance, belief in a deity is not essential to [[Buddhism]].

===Mythology===
The term ''[[mythology]]'' usually refers either to a system of myths or to the study of myths.&lt;ref&gt;"Mythology", ''OED'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the word "myth" itself has multiple (and some contradictory) definitions:
* 2007: According to the [[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary, "Myth: "1 a: a usually traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the [[world view]] of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon. b: [[Parable]], [[Allegory]]. 2 a: a popular belief or tradition that has grown up around something or someone; especially: one embodying the ideals and institutions of a society or segment of [[society]]. 2b: an unfounded or false notion. 3: a person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence. 4: the whole body of myths.&lt;ref&gt;"Myth", Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to the study of culture and religion, these are some of the definitions scholars have used:

* 1968: The [[classicist]] [[Robert Graves]] defines myths as "whatever religious or heroic legends are so foreign to a student's experience that he cannot believe them to be true."&lt;ref&gt;Graves 1968, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1973: Another classicist, GS Kirk, rejects the notion that all myths are religious or sacred. In the category of "myth", he includes many legendary accounts that are "[[Secularity|secular]]" for all practical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk 1973, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1997: [[Folklorist]]s define a myth as "a sacred [[narrative]] explaining how the world and humankind came to be in their present form".&lt;ref&gt;Dundes 1997, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004: In religious studies, the word "myth" is usually reserved for stories whose main characters are gods or [[demigod]]s.&lt;ref name="Segal 2004, p. 5"&gt;Segal 2004, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004: The classicist Richard Buxton defines a myth as "a socially powerful traditional story".&lt;ref&gt;Buxton, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004: Robert A. Segal, professor of theories of religion at the [[Lancaster University]], defines "myth" broadly as any story whose "main figures [are] personalities -- divine, human, or even animal. Excluded would be impersonal forces such as Plato's Good."&lt;ref name="Segal 2004, p. 5"/&gt;

==Similarities between different religious mythologies==

Given any of the above definitions of "myth", the myths of many religions, both ancient and modern, share common elements. Widespread similarities between religious mythologies include the following:
* an initial [[Paradise]] preceding ordinary historical time&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', 1967 p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the story of a god who undergoes death and resurrection ([[life-death-rebirth deity]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://altreligion.about.com/library/weekly/aa052902a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paganlibrary.com/reference/pagan_resurrection_myths.php]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The mythical geography of many religions involves an ''[[axis mundi]]'', or Cosmic Center.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols: A Mircea Eliade Reader'', 1976, pp. 372-75.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many myths feature a global flood.&lt;ref&gt;For some examples, see Bierlein 2004, pp. 121-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Creation myth]]s
* [[Supreme deity (disambiguation)|Supreme deity]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;
* [[Hero's journey]]

The similarities between cultures and time periods can be useful, but it is usually not easy to combine beliefs and histories from different groups. Simplification of cultures and time periods by eliminating detailed data remain vulnerable or flimsy in this area of research.

==Contrasts between different religious mythologies==

Though there are similarities among most religious mythologies, there are also contrasts. Many mythologies focus on explanations of the universe, natural phenomena, or other themes of human existence, often ascribing [[creation myth|agency]] to one or more [[deities]] or other [[supernatural]] forces. However, some religions have very few of this kind of story of cosmic explanation. For instance,  the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[parable of the arrow]] warns against such speculations as "[Is] the world eternal or not eternal? [Is] the soul different from the body? [Does] the enlightened exist after death or not?", viewing them as irrelevant to the goal of escaping suffering.&lt;ref&gt;"The Parable of the Arrow"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic views==
In [[academia]], the term "myth" often refers to stories whose culture regards them as true (as opposed to fictitious).&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 1, 8-10; ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, many scholars will call a body of stories "mythology", leaving open the question of whether the stories are true or false. For example, in ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism'', English professor Howard Schwartz writes, "the definition of 'mythology' offered here does not attempt to determine if biblical or subsequent narratives are true or false, i.e., historically accurate or not".&lt;ref name="Schwartz, p. lxxviii"&gt;Schwartz, p. lxxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the beginning of modern philosophy and science in the 16th century, many Western intellectuals have seen myth as outdated.&lt;ref&gt;See Armstrong, pp. 122-27. For example, an 18th century intellectual movement called [[deism]] rejected myths about divine intervention, limiting God's role to that of a first cause (Robinson), and a 20th century movement led by the theologian [[Rudolf Bultmann]] sought to "demythologize" Christianity, reinterpreting its myths as psychological allegory (Segal, pp. 47-51; Muthuraj). Some 19th and early 20th century secular scholars predicted that science would replace myth, even in religion. The anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] argued that science was pushing traditional mythology out of religion, which would henceforth consist only of metaphysics and ethics (Segal, p. 14). And the anthropologist [[Sir James George Frazer]] even wrote, "In the last analysis, magic, religion, and science are nothing but theories of thought; and as science has supplanted its predecessors, so it may hereafter be itself superseded by some more perfect hypothesis" (Frazer, p. 712).&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some argued that the Christian religion would be better off without mythology, or even that Christianity would be better off without religion:&lt;ref name="Muthuraj"&gt;Muthuraj&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[J. A. T.] Robinson argued in favor of "the detaching of the Christian doctrine of God from any necessary dependence on a 'supernaturalistic' worldview". He understood this as a prophetic aspect of the Church's ministry to the world. [...] At this time atheism was regarded as the Christian Gospel that should be preached to the world. J. J. Altizer, for example, maintained [this] boldly by stating, "Throughout its history Christian theology has been thwarted from reaching its intrinsic goal by its bondage to a transcendent, a sovereign, and an impassive God". [...] [Dietrich] Bonhoffer called persistently for "Religionless Christianity".&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the 20th century, many scholars have resisted this trend, defending myth from modern criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mircea Eliade]], a professor of the history of religions, declared that myth did not hold religion back, that myth was an essential foundation of religion, and that eliminating myth would eliminate a piece of the human psyche.&lt;ref&gt;According to religious thought, said Eliade, myths establish models for human behavior, and "the more religious man is, the more paradigmatic models does he possess as a guide to his attitudes and actions" (Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 100). Eliade believed that modern novels, ideologies, customs, and pastimes contain "mythological elements" (Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 181-93), and that some mythological elements fall within the "transconscious", which Eliade defined as a set of universal human images, symbols, and sentiments (Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', pp. 16-17).&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade approached myth sympathetically at a time when religious thinkers were trying to purge religion of its mythological elements:&lt;ref name="Muthuraj"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Eliade wrote about "sky and sky gods" when Christian theology was shaken at its very foundations by the "death of God" theology. He spoke of "God up there" when theologians such as J. A. T. Robinson were busy with erasing the mythical language of [a] three-storied universe that underlies the early Christian thought and experience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Similarly, [[Joseph Campbell]] believed that people could not understand their individual lives without mythology to aid them. By recalling the significance of old myths, he encouraged awareness of them.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Campbell claimed that mythology's primary function is "that of eliciting and supporting a sense of awe before the mystery of being" (Campbell, p. 519), and that mythology also serves "to initiate the individual into the order of realities of his own psyche" (Campbell, p. 521).&lt;/ref&gt; In responding to the interview question "How would you define mythology?", Joseph Campbell answered:&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Thou Are That, p. 111 [in:] James W. Menzies, True Myth, s. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;My favorite definition of mythology: other people's religion. My favorite definition of religion: misunderstanding of mythology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Religious views==
Most religions contain a body of traditional sacred stories that are believed to express profound truth. Some religious organizations and practitioners believe that some or all of their traditional stories are not only sacred and "true" but also historically accurate and [[revelation|divinely revealed]] and that calling such stories "myths" disrespects their special status. Other religious organizations and practitioners have no problem with categorizing their sacred stories as myths.

===Opposition to categorizing all sacred stories as myths===
====Modern-day opposition====
Some religious believers take offense when what they consider to be historical aspects of their faith are labeled as "myth". Such believers distinguish between religious fables or myths, on one hand, and those sacred narratives which are described by their tradition as being history or revelation, on the other. For instance, [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]] Father [[John Hardon|John A. Hardon]] insists that "Christianity is not mythology. What we believe in is not religious fantasies, no matter how pious."&lt;ref&gt;Hardon&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelical Christian theologian [[Carl F. H. Henry]] insisted that "Judeo-Christian revelation has nothing in common with the category of myth".&lt;ref&gt;Carl F. H. Henry, quoted by Mohler&lt;/ref&gt;

====The roots of the popular meaning of "myth"====
Especially within Christianity, objection to the word "myth" rests on a historical basis. By the time of Christ, the Greco-Roman world had started to use the term "myth" (Greek ''muthos'') to mean "fable, fiction, lie"; as a result, the early Christian theologians used "myth" in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', 1968, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the derogatory meaning of the word "myth" is the traditional Christian meaning, and the expression "Christian mythology", as used in academic discourse,&lt;ref name=grassie&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grassie |first1=William |date=March 1998 |title=Science as Epic? Can the modern evolutionary cosmology be a mythic story for our time? |journal=Science &amp; Spirit |volume=9 |issue=1 |quote=The word 'myth' is popularly understood to mean idle fancy, fiction, or falsehood; but there is another meaning of the word in academic discourse. A myth, in this latter sense of the word, is a story that serves to define the fundamental worldview of a culture .... Using the original Greek term ''mythos'' is perhaps a better way to distinguish this more positive and all-encompassing definition of the word.}}&lt;/ref&gt; may offend Christians for this reason.

In addition, this early Christian use of the term "myth" passed into popular usage.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', 1967, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when essential [[sacred mysteries]] and teachings are described as ''myth'', in modern English, the word often still implies that it is "idle fancy, fiction, or falsehood".&lt;ref name=grassie/&gt; This description could be taken as a direct attack on [[religious belief]], quite contrary to the meaning ostensibly intended by the academic use of the term. Further, in academic writing, though "myth" usually means a fundamental worldview story, even there it is occasionally ambiguous or clearly denotes "falsehood", as in the "[[Christ myth theory]]". The original term "[[mythos]]" (which has no pejorative connotation in English) may be a better word to distinguish the positive definition from the negative.&lt;ref name=grassie/&gt;

===Non-opposition to categorizing sacred stories as myths===
Modern day clergy and practitioners within some religious movements have no problem classifying the religion's sacred stories as "myths". They see the sacred texts as indeed containing religious truths, divinely inspired but delivered in the language of mankind. Some examples follow.

====Christianity====
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s love of myths and devout [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith came together in his assertion that [[mythology]] is the divine echo of "the Truth".&lt;ref&gt;Wood&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien wrote that myths held "fundamental things".&lt;ref&gt;Menion, 2003/2004 citing essays by Tolkien using the words "fundamental things".&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed these beliefs in his poem ''[[Mythopoeia]]'' circa 1931, which describes myth-making as an act of "sub-creation" within God's primary creation.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, ''Mythopoeia'', circa 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem in part says creation is "myth-woven and elf-patterned":

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;... There is no [[firmament]],
only a void, unless a jewelled tent
myth-woven and [[elf]]-patterned; and no earth,
unless the mother's womb whence all have birth.&lt;/poem&gt;|JRR Tolkien}}

Tolkien's opinion was adopted by another [[Christianity|Christian]] writer, [[C. S. Lewis]], in their conversations: "Tolkien explained to Lewis that the story of Christ was the true myth at the very heart of history and at the very root of reality."&lt;ref&gt;Pearce&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. S. Lewis]] freely called the Christ story a "true myth", and he believed that even pagan myths express spiritual truths. In his opinion, the difference between the Christ story and pagan myths is that the Christ story is historically as well as spiritually true. Lewis writes,&lt;ref&gt;letter to Arthur Greeves, quoted by Brown&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened: and one must be content to accept it in the same way, remembering that it is God's myth where the others are men's myths: i. e. the Pagan stories are God expressing Himself through the minds of poets, using such images as He found there, while Christianity is God expressing Himself through what we call real things.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another Christian writer, the Catholic priest Father [[Andrew Greeley]], freely applies the term "myth" to Christianity. In his book ''Myths of Religion'', he defends this terminology:&lt;ref&gt;Greeley, ''Myths of Religion''; quoted in Bierlein 1994, pp. 304-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Many Christians have objected to my use of this word [myth] even when I define it specifically. They are terrified by a word which may even have a slight suggestion of fantasy. However, my usage is the one that is common among historians of religion, literary critics, and social scientists. It is a valuable and helpful usage; there is no other word which conveys what these scholarly traditions mean when they refer to myth. The Christian would be well advised to get over his fear of the word and appreciate how important a tool it can be for understanding the content of his faith.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At a "Consultation on the Relationship Between the Wesleyan Tradition
and the Natural Sciences" in Kansas City, Missouri, on October 19, 1991, Dennis Bratcher presented a discussion of the adaptation of Near Eastern mythical thought by the Israelites.&lt;ref name="Bratcher"&gt;Bratcher&lt;/ref&gt; Bratcher argued that the Old Testament absorbed Near Eastern pagan mythology (although he drew a sharp distinction between the literally-interpreted myths of the Near Eastern pagans and the "mythopoetic" use of imagery from pagan myths by the Hebrews). During this presentation, he gave the following disclaimer:&lt;ref name="Bratcher"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the term "myth" as used here does not mean "false" or "fiction." Even in my old and yellowed Webster's, "fiction" is the ''third'' meaning of the word. In its primary and more technical meaning "myth" refers to a story or group of stories that serve to explain how a particular society views their world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Judaism====
Some [[Judaism|Jewish]] scholars, including [[Dov Noy]], a professor of folklore at Hebrew University and founder of the Israel Folktale Archives, and [[Howard Schwartz (writer and editor)|Howard Schwartz]], Jewish anthologist and English professor at the University of Missouri – St. Louis, have discussed traditional Jewish stories as "mythology".&lt;ref&gt;Schram&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarz authored the book ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism''. It consists of myths and belief statements excerpted from—and, in some cases, synthesized from a number of excerpts from—both Biblical and non-Biblical Jewish texts. According to Schwartz, the Jewish people continue to elaborate on, and compose additions to, their traditional mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. lxxv&lt;/ref&gt; In the book's introduction, Schwartz states that the word "myth", as used in the book, "is not offered to mean something that is not true, as in the current popular usage".&lt;ref name="Schwartz, p. lxxviii"/&gt;

====Neopaganism====
[[Neopaganism|Neopagans]] frequently refer to their sacred stories as "myths". [[Asatru]], a modern-day revival of Germanic Paganism, holds "that the [[Eddas]], Myths and [[saga|Norse Sagas]] are the divinely inspired wisdom of [its] religion".&lt;ref&gt;"About Us"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wicca]], another Neopagan movement, also applies the term "mythology" to its stories.&lt;ref&gt;"The Wheel of the Year / the Sabbats"; "What is Wicca?"; "Workshops and Talks"&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a group of [[Mennonite]]s who are descendants of Dutch [[Anabaptists]] who settled for about 250 years in [[West Prussia]] and established colonies in the south west of the [[Russian Empire]] (present-day Ukraine) beginning in 1789. Since the late 19th century, many of them have come to countries throughout the Western Hemisphere. The rest were forcibly relocated, so that very few of their descendants now live at the location of the original colonies. Russian Mennonites are traditionally [[multilingual]] with [[Plautdietsch language|Plautdietsch]] (Mennonite Low German) as their [[first language]] and [[lingua franca]]. The term "Russian Mennonite" refers to the country where they resided before their immigration to the Americas and not to their ethnic heritage. In 2014 there are several hundred thousand Russian Mennonites: about 200,000 in Germany, [[Mennonites in Mexico|100,000 in Mexico]], [[Mennonites in Bolivia|70,000 in Bolivia]], [[Mennonites in Paraguay|40,000 in Paraguay]], [[Mennonites in Belize|10,000 in Belize]] and tens of thousands in Canada and the US and a few thousand in [[Mennonites in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Mennonites in Uruguay|Uruguay]] and Brazil.

== Origins in the Vistula Delta ==

[[File:Mennonites on New River, Belize detail.jpg|thumb|Mennonites on [[New River (Belize)|New River]], Belize]]
{{main article| Vistula delta Mennonites}}
In the early-to-mid 16th century, Mennonites began to flee to the [[Vistula]] delta region in order to avoid persecution in the [[Low Countries]], especially [[Friesland]] and [[Flanders]], seeking religious freedom and exemption from [[military service]]. They gradually replaced their [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Frisian languages]] with the [[Plautdietsch]] dialect spoken in the area, blending into it elements of their native tongues. Today Plautdietsch is the distinct Mennonite language which developed over a period of 300 years in the Vistula delta region and south Russia. The Mennonites of Dutch origin were joined by Mennonites from other parts of Europe, including the German-speaking parts of what is now Switzerland. Some Poles also became Mennonites and were assimilated into the Vistula delta Mennonites.

In 1772, most of the West-Prussian [[Vistula delta Mennonites|Mennonites' land in the Vistula area]] became part of the Kingdom of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in the first of the [[Partitions of Poland]]. [[Frederick William II of Prussia]] ascended the throne in 1786 and imposed heavy fees on the Mennonites in exchange for continued military exemption.

== Migration to Russia ==
{{main article|Chortitza| Molotschna}}
[[Catherine the Great]] of Russia issued a manifesto in 1763 inviting all Europeans to come and settle various pieces of land within [[Novorossiya|New Russia]], especially in the Volga River region. For a variety of reasons, Germans responded to this in large numbers. Mennonites from the Vistula delta region of Prussia later sent delegates to negotiate an extension of this manifesto and, in 1789, [[Paul I of Russia|Crown Prince Paul]] signed a new agreement with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/jktsn/manifest.htm |title=Catherine's Manifesto and Paul's Mennonite Agreement |publisher=Members.aol.com |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mennonite migration to Russia from Prussia was led by [[Jacob Hoeppner]] and Johann Bartsch. Their settlement territory was northwest of the [[Sea of Azov]], and had just been acquired from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|Russo-Turkish War, 1768–1774]]. Many of the Mennonites in Prussia accepted this invitation, establishing [[Chortitza]] on the [[Dnieper River]] as their first colony in 1789. A second larger colony, [[Molotschna]], was founded in 1803.

Mennonites lived alongside [[Nogais]]—semi-[[nomad]]ic pastoralists—in the [[Molochna]] region of southern Ukraine starting from 1803, when Mennonites first arrived, until 1860, when the Nogai Tatars departed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bethelks.edu/mennonitelife/2007spring/staples.php |title=Mennonite Life |publisher=Bethelks.edu |date=2004-06-03 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mennonites provided agricultural jobs to Nogais and rented pasture from them. Nogai raids on Mennonite herds were a constant problem in the first two decades of settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goshen.edu/mqr/pastissues/apr00staples.html |title="On Civilizing the Nogais": Mennonite-Nogai Economic Relations, 1825-1860 |publisher=Goshen.edu |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Mennonite settlements on the [[Vistula]] near [[Warsaw]], Deutsch-Kazun and Deutsch-Wymysle, came under Russian control when the border was readjusted at the [[Congress of Vienna]]. Some of these families emigrated to the Molotschna settlement after it was established. Deutsch-Michalin near Machnovka was founded in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;Goertz, Adalbert, [http://www.mennonitegenealogy.com/russia/michalin.htm Deutsch-Michalin Mennonites]&lt;/ref&gt; Many families from this settlement moved to nearby [[Volhynia]] in 1802. Swiss Mennonites of [[Amish]] descent from [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] settled near [[Dubno]], Volhynia province in 1815. Other Galician Mennonites lived near [[Lviv]].

When the Prussian government eliminated exemption from military service on religious grounds, the remaining Mennonites were eager to emigrate to Russia. They were offered land along the [[Volga River]] in [[Samara Oblast|Samara]] and exemption from military service for twenty years, after which they could pay a special exemption tax.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C. Henry, ''Smith's Story of the Mennonites'' (1981), p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; Two settlements, Trakt and Alt-Samara (to distinguish it from [[Neu Samara Colony]]), were founded in 1853 and 1861 respectively.

By 1870 about 9000 individuals had immigrated to Russia, mostly to the Chortitza and Molotschna settlements which, with population increase, numbered about 45,000. Forty daughter colonies were established by 1914, occupying nearly {{convert|12000|km2|sqmi}}, with a total population of 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C. Henry, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==

The colonists formed villages of fifteen to thirty families, each with 70 ha (175 acres) of land. The settlements retained some communal land and a common granary for use by the poor in lean years. Income from communal property provided funding for large projects, such as forming daughter colonies for the growing population. Insurance was also organized separately and outside of the control of the Russian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{runeberg |url=http://runeberg.org/jstolstoi/0175.html |title=In the Land of Tolstoi |page=155 |year=1897 |author=Jonas Stadling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the settlers raised cattle, sheep and general crops to provide for their household. The barren steppes were much drier than their Vistula delta homeland and it took years to work out the proper dry-land farming practices. They grew [[mulberries]] for the silk industry, produced honey, flax and [[tobacco]], and marketed fruits and vegetables for city markets. By the 1830s wheat became the dominant crop.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

Expanding population and the associated pressure for more farmland became a problem by 1860. The terms of the settlement agreement prevented farms from being divided; they were required to pass intact from one generation to the next. Since agriculture was the main economic activity, an expanding class of discontented, landless poor arose. Their problems tended to be ignored by the village assembly, which consisted of voting landowners. By the early 1860s the problem became so acute that the landless organized a party that petitioned the Russian government for relief. A combination of factors relieved their plight. The Russian government permitted farms to be divided in half or quarters and ordered release of the village's communal land. The colonies themselves purchased land and formed daughter colonies on the eastern frontier extending into [[Siberia]] and [[Turkestan]]. These new colonies included [[Bergtal]], [[Neu Samara Colony]] and the [[Mennonite settlements of Altai]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 265-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

As wheat farming expanded, the demand for mills and farm equipment grew. The first large foundry was established in Chortitza in 1860 and other firms followed. By 1911 the eight largest Mennonite-owned factories produced 6% of the total Russian output (over 3 million rubles), shipped machinery to all parts of the empire and employed 1744 workers.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual output of ''Lepp and Wallman'' of Schönwiese was 50,000 mowers, 3000 [[threshing machine]]s, thousands of gangplows in addition to other farm equipment. Flour and feed mills were originally wind-powered, a skill transplanted from Prussia. These were eventually replaced with motor- and steam-driven mills. Milling and its supporting industries grew to dominate the industrial economy of the colonies and nearby communities.

== Local government ==

Mennonite colonies were self-governing with little intervention from the Russian authorities. The village, the basic unit of government, was headed by an elected magistrate who oversaw village affairs. Each village controlled its own school, roads and cared for the poor. Male landowners decided local matters at village assemblies.

Villages were grouped into districts. All of the Chortitza villages formed one district; Molotschna was divided into two districts: Halbstadt and Gnadenfeld. A district superintendent headed a regional bureau that could administer corporal punishment and handle other matters affecting the villages in common. Insurance and fire protection were handled at the regional level, as well as dealing with delinquents and other social problems. The Mennonite colonies functioned as a democratic state, enjoying freedoms beyond those of ordinary Russian peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to village schools, the Mennonite colonies established their own hospitals, a mental hospital and a school for the deaf. They cared for orphans and elderly and provided an insurance program. By being largely self-sufficient in these local matters, they were able to minimize their burden on and contact with the Russian government.

Mennonites stayed out of Russian politics and social movements that preceded the Russian revolution. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] they did exercise their right to vote. Most aligned themselves with the [[Octobrist Party]] because of its guarantee of religious freedoms and [[freedom of the press]] for minority groups. Hermann Bergmann was an Octobrist member of the Third and Fourth [[State Duma (Imperial)|State Duma]]s; Peter Schröder, a [[Constitutional Democratic party]] member from Crimea, was a member of the fourth Duma.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

At a time when compulsory education was unknown in Europe, the Mennonite colonies formed an elementary school in each village. Students learned practical skills such as reading and writing German and arithmetic. Religion was included as was singing in many schools. The teacher was typically a craftsperson or herder, untrained in teaching, who fit class time around his occupation.

In 1820 the Molotschna colony started a secondary school at Ohrloff, bringing a trained teacher from Prussia. The Central School was started in Chortitza in 1842. Over three thousand pupils attended the Central School with up to 8% of the colonists receiving a secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; A school of commerce was started in Halbstadt employing a faculty with full graduate education. Those who wanted to pursue post-secondary education attended universities in Switzerland, Germany as well as Russia.

== Religious life ==

Typically each village or group of villages organized an [[Congregationalist polity|independent congregation]]. Cultural and traditional differences between Frisian, Flemish and [[West Prussia]]n Mennonites were also reflected in those of their churches. They all agreed on fundamental Mennonite beliefs such as [[believer's baptism]], [[nonresistance]] and avoidance of [[oath]]s. Pastors of Flemish congregations read sermons from a book while seated at a table. Frisian pastors stood while delivering the sermon.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastors were untrained and chosen from within the congregation. Unpaid pastors were selected from among the wealthier members—large landowners, sometimes teachers—allowing them to make a living while serving the congregation. The combined effect of respect for their position and material wealth gave them substantial influence over the community. The religious and secular leadership within a village often colluded against the poorer members.

Church discipline was exercised in the form of [[excommunication]] against those committing gross sins. The most conservative congregations practiced "[[Shunning#Anabaptism|avoidance]]", which entailed cutting all business and social ties with an unrepentant member.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Because being part of a Mennonite congregation was required to enjoy the special benefits the Russian government provided to colonists, excommunication had broader implications. This was softened by the various internal factions, which allowed a person banned from one congregation to join another.

=== Kleine Gemeinde ===
{{main article|Kleine Gemeinde}}
[[Klaas Reimer]] and a group of eighteen followers broke from the main group and formed the [[Kleine Gemeinde]]. Reimer's main complaint was that Mennonite leaders were straying from their traditional nonresistant stance when they turned lawbreakers over to the government for punishment while at the same time church leaders were lax in enforcing spiritual discipline. In 1860 a portion of this group moved to [[Crimea]], adopted baptism by immersion and became known as the [[Krimmer Mennonite Brethren]].

=== Mennonite Brethren ===
{{main article|Mennonite Brethren Church}}
[[Pietism|Pietistic]] influences, introduced earlier among the West Prussian Mennonites, were transplanted to the Molotschna colony. The pastor of a neighboring congregation, Eduard Wüst, reinforced this pietism. Wüst was a [[Christian revival|revival]]ist who stressed repentance and Christ as a [[Salvation|personal savior]], influencing Catholics, Lutherans and Mennonites in the area. He associated with many Mennonite leaders, including Leonhard Sudermann.

In 1859, Joseph Höttmann, a former associate of Wüst met with a group of Mennonites to discuss problems within the main Mennonite body. Their discussion centered on participating in [[closed communion]] with church members who were unholy or not [[Religious conversion|converted]] and baptism of adults by immersion.

The [[Mennonite Brethren Church]] formally broke with the main church on January 6, 1860 when this growing group of dissenters presented a document to the elders of the Molotschna Mennonite Churches which indicated "that the total Mennonite brotherhood has decayed to the extent that we can no more be part of it" and fear the "approach of an unavoidable judgment of God."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mennonite Brethren movement spread throughout the Mennonite colonies and produced many distinguished leaders, particularly in Molotschna. By breaking religious and cultural patterns that had become a hindrance to Mennonite society, the contribution of the Mennonite Brethren allowed all Mennonites groups to pursue a more wholesome Christian life.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 281-282.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General Conference ===

The main body of Mennonites continued to be congregational in organization until 1882 when the ''General Conference of Mennonite Congregations in Russia'' was formed. Cooperation among Mennonite congregations throughout the empire became necessary for dealing with common interests such as publishing a hymnal, adopting a [[confession of faith]], preserving the German language, education and running the forestry service, an alternative to military service. The conference adopted the motto ''Unity in essentials, tolerance in non-essentials, moderation in all things''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stolypin reform|The Russianization program of Stolypin]] required the conference to publish its proceedings in Russian, certify all delegates with the imperial government and allow a government representative to attend all sessions. The conference found itself devoting more time to dealing with changing government policies and protecting the special privileges of Mennonites. An important task was to convince the government that Mennonitism was an established religion and not a ''sect'', a label applied to small religious groups who were regularly mistreated within the Russian empire.

== First wave of emigration ==

As nationalism grew in central Europe, the Russian government could no longer justify the special status of its German colonists. In 1870 they announced a Russification plan that would end all special privileges by 1880. Mennonites were particularly alarmed at the possibility of losing their exemption from military service and their right for schools to use the German language, which they believed was necessary to maintain their cultural and religious life.

Delegates were sent to Petersburg in 1871 to meet with the czar and appeal for relief on religious grounds. They met with high officials, but failed to present the czar with their petition. A similar attempt the next year was also unsuccessful, but were assured by [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|the Tsar's brother Grand Duke Konstantin]] that the new law would provide a way to address the concerns of the Mennonites in the form of noncombatant military service.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most conscientious Mennonites could not accept any form of service that supported making war, prompting their community leaders to seek immigration options. In 1873 a delegation of twelve explored North America, seeking large tracts of fertile farmland. This group consisted of Leonhard Sudermann and Jacob Buller of the [[Alexanderwohl Mennonite Church|Alexanderwohl congregation]] representing the Molotschna settlement; Tobias Unruh from Volhynia settlements; Andreas Schrag of the Swiss Volhynia congregations; Heinrich Wiebe, Jacob Peters and Cornelius Buhr from the [[Bergthal Colony]]; William Ewert from West Prussia; Cornelius Toews and David Klassen of the ''Kleine Gemeinde'' and Paul and Lorenz Tschetter representing the [[Hutterite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; This group returned with positive reports of good land available in [[Manitoba]], [[Minnesota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Nebraska]] and [[Kansas]].

The more conservative groups—those from ''Kleine Gemeinde'', Bergthal and Chortitza—chose Canada, which promised privileges equal to those previously held in Russia and a large tract of land to reestablish colonies in Manitoba. The more liberal groups—those from Molotschna—and the Hutterites chose the United States. Entire communities such as Alexanderwohl and Bergtal prepared to move as a unit as well as many individual families from among the other Mennonite villages. They sold their property, often at reduced prices and worked through the red tape and high fees of procuring passports.

Realizing that 40,000 of Russia's most industrious farmers were preparing to leave for North America, the Russian government sent [[Eduard Totleben]] to the colonies in May 1874. Meeting with community leaders, he exaggerated the difficulties that would be encountered in North America and offered an alternative [[national service]] that would not be connected in any way to the military. His intervention convinced the more liberal Mennonites to stay.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1874 and 1880, of the approximately 45,000 Mennonites in South Russia, ten thousand departed for the United States and eight thousand for Manitoba. The settlement of Mennonites, primarily in the central United States, where available cropland had similarity to that in the Crimean Peninsula, coincided with the completion of the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Others looked east, and in one of the strangest chapters of Mennonite history, [[Claas Epp, Jr.]], Abraham Peters and other leaders led hundreds of Mennonites to Central Asia in the 1880s, where they expected Christ's imminent return. They settled in the Talas Valley of Turkestan and in the Khanate of Khiva.&lt;ref&gt;Ratliff, Walter ''[http://www.PilgrimsOnTheSilkRoad.com Pilgrims On The Silk Road]'' p.??, {{ISBN|978-1606081334}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those who remained in Russia, the military service question was resolved by 1880 with a substitute four-year [[Forestry service (Russia)|forestry service]] program for men of military age.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== World War I ==

During the period of the 'Great War', the Mennonites in Russia were well advanced socially and economically. Many large agricultural estates and business entities were controlled by Mennonite interests. They had a reputation for outstanding efficiency and quality and were noted across Russia for their agricultural and organizational abilities. The precedent of [[nonresistance|non-resistant]] national service had been established years before and the Mennonites therefore had a system to handle military service requests at the outbreak of war. During [[World War I]], 5000 Mennonite men served in both forestry and hospital units and transported wounded from the battlefield to [[Moscow]] and [[Ekaterinoslav]] hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mennonite congregations were responsible for funding these forms of alternative service, as well as supporting the men's families during their absence, a burden of 3.5 million rubles annually. During this time there was a progressive breakdown in the autonomy of the Mennonite colonies and social and financial pressure began to take their effect on the Mennonite people and their institutions. Property and possessions began to be confiscated for the war effort and certain industrial complexes turned to military production (some voluntary). Much of the Mennonite hope at that time was based on the preservation of the existing [[Russian Provisional Government]]. However, as the war progressed, the social tide turned against the existing power structure and Russia began a march toward structural discord.

The chaos that followed the collapse of the [[Russian Provisional Government]] was devastating to much of Ukraine, including the Mennonite colonies. The [[Red Army|Red]] and [[White movement|White armies]] moved through the region, confiscating food and livestock. [[Nestor Makhno]]'s anarchist army generally targeted Mennonites because they were thought of as "[[Kulak]]s" and an entity generally more advanced and wealthy than the surrounding Ukrainian peasants. The Mennonites' Germanic background also served to inflame negative sentiment during the period of revolution. It is also rumored that [[Makhno]] himself had served on a Mennonite estate in childhood and harbored negative feelings based on treatment he received while employed there. Hundreds of Mennonites were murdered, robbed, imprisoned and raped during this period, and villages including (and around) Chortitza, Zagradovka and Nikolaipol were damaged and destroyed. Many more lives were lost to [[typhus]], [[cholera]] and [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, spread by the armies warring throughout the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 314-315.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the tragedy unfolding around them, some of the avowed pacifist Mennonites turned to self-defense and established militia units ([[Selbstschutz]]) to ward off raiding forces with the help of the German Army. While generally regarded as a failure of spiritual commitment by many within the community (currently and at the time), the forces initially achieved some military success in defending Mennonite colonies and families while the communities tried to escape and/or relocate. Ultimately the self-defence militia was overwhelmed once Makhno's anarchists aligned themselves with the Red Army early in 1919. While the resistance certainly helped defend Mennonite communities against initial attacks, it may also have served to inflame some of the atrocities that followed. After this period, many Mennonites were dispossessed and ultimately their remaining properties and possessions were nationalized ([[collectivization]]) by the Soviet authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Krahn, Cornelius |author2=Al Reimer |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1989 |title=Selbstschutz, Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online |accessdate=2013-03-21 |url=http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/S444ME.html/#section-2 |website=Gameo.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202025851/http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/S444ME.html/#section-2 |archivedate=2010-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Famine ==
{{main|Holodomor}}

Mennonites of Molotschna sent a commission to North America in the summer of 1920 to alert American Mennonites of the dire conditions of war-torn Ukraine. Their plight succeeded in uniting various branches of Mennonites to form [[Mennonite Central Committee]] in an effort to coordinate aid.

The new organization planned to provide aid to Ukraine via existing Mennonite relief work in [[Istanbul]]. The Istanbul group, mainly [[Goshen College]] graduates, produced three volunteers, who at great risk entered Ukraine during the ongoing [[Russian Civil War]]. They arrived in the Mennonite village of Halbstadt in the [[Molotschna|Molotschna settlement]] just as [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|General Wrangel]] of the White Army was retreating. Two of the volunteers withdrew with the Wrangel army, while [[Clayton Kratz]], who remained in Halbstadt as it was overrun by the Red Army, was never heard from again.

A year passed before official permission was received from the Soviet government to do relief work among the villages of Ukraine (see [[Russian famine of 1921]]). Kitchens provided 25,000 people a day with rations over a period of three years beginning in 1922, with a peak of 40,000 servings during August of that year. Fifty [[Fordson]] tractor and plow combinations were sent to Mennonite villages to replace horses that had been stolen and confiscated during the war. The cost of this relief effort was $1.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second wave of emigration ==

As conditions improved, Mennonites turned their attention from survival to emigration. Though the [[New Economic Policy]] appeared to be less radical than previous Soviet reforms, thousands of Mennonites saw no future under the communists. After years of negotiation with foreign governments and Moscow, arrangements were made for emigration to Canada, Paraguay and Argentina. Because Canada had not recognized the Soviet government, Moscow would not deal with them directly. Emigrants bound for Canada were processed through [[Riga]]. Those who could not pass the medical exam—usually because of [[trachoma]]—were allowed to stay in Germany and [[Southampton]] in England until they were healthy. By 1930, twenty-one thousand Mennonites had arrived in Canada, most on credit provided by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Mennonites from western Siberia who subsequently settled along the [[Amur River|Amur]] in unrealized hopes of better living conditions, escaped over the frozen river to [[Harbin]], China. A few hundred were allowed entry into California and Washington. The majority remained as refugees until the [[Nansen International Office for Refugees]] of the [[League of Nations]] intervened and arranged resettlement in Paraguay and Brazil in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 335-336.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those that remained in their home villages were subject to [[Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union|exile]] to Siberia and other remote regions east of the [[Urals]]. From 1929 to 1940, one in eight men were removed, usually under the pretext of political accusations, to labor camps from which few ever returned or were heard from again.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collectivization ==

With the onset of economic and agricultural reforms, large estates and the communal land of the Mennonite colonies were confiscated. The next step was to reduce the model farms by 60% and then another 50% percent—an insufficient size to support a family. The confiscated land was given to peasants from outside the Mennonite communities, often communist party members. These new villagers soon controlled the local government, further confiscating land and rights from the Mennonite majority by labeling landowners and leaders [[kulak]]s and sending them into exile. The government taxed the remaining landowners so heavily that they could not possibly produce enough to meet the obligation and their land was confiscated as payment. As [[collectivization]] proceeded, there was some hope that Mennonites could run their own [[Kolkhoz|collective farm]]s, but with the introduction of Stalin's [[first five-year plan]] there was no hope that such a scheme would be allowed.

Starting in 1918 religious freedoms were restricted. Churches and congregations had to be registered with the government. Ministers were disenfranchised and lost their rights as citizens. Ministers could not be teachers, which was the livelihood of many Mennonite pastors. They and their family members could not join cooperatives or craft guilds. Because of these restrictions, ministers had a strong incentive to emigrate, and few were willing to replace them. Congregations could no longer do charitable work of any kind, which destroyed the well developed social institutions with the Mennonite colonies. Villages lost control of their schools; all religious content was prohibited. Sunday was abolished as a holiday.

During World War I the Russians had permitted Mennonites to serve in non-combat capacities in the military. This practice was not continued.&lt;ref name="canadianchristianity1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadianchristianity.com/bc/bccn/1207/06stalin.html |title=Mennonite letters survived Stalin's reign of terror |publisher=Canadianchristianity.com |date=1933-10-08 |accessdate=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Russian withdrawal from World War I, the Russian Civil War ensued, with an ultimate Red victory. The Russian Mennonites, many of whom were also known as being part of the one million or so Volga Germans living in their own established communities, were approached by the Soviet authorities and issued new standards and expectations. Education was to be controlled according to these new directives by the State, and families were eventually to be separated, with children sent to various live-in schools, while parents were to be assigned according to State needs.

These directives were described by a Volga German teacher, Henry Wieler, who attended these State meetings and related the events in his detailed Journal, Tagabook, which today is partially translated but available in the published book,  The Quiet in the Land,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wieler|first1=Henry|title=The Quiet in the Land|date=2005|publisher=Trafford|isbn=978-1412047869|pages=127|url=http://henrywieler.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Henry Wieler.

== World War II to the Stalin era ==

In 1937 and 1938 the NKVD carried out ethnically motivated purges of German descendants and German language speakers, including Mennonites.&lt;ref name="fresno1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.fresno.edu/04/16/2014/lecturer-tells-story-mennonites-siberia |title=Lecturer tells the story of Mennonites in Siberia &amp;#124; FPU News |publisher=News.fresno.edu |accessdate=2014-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529103451/http://news.fresno.edu/04/16/2014/lecturer-tells-story-mennonites-siberia |archivedate=2014-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Stalin fomented cooperation with the Russian Orthodox Church in World War II, Mennonites and Protestants were seen as more dangerous.&lt;ref name="fresno1"/&gt; During the [[Holodomor]] in Ukraine, there was active persecution of German-speaking people as a potential threat to the state, and a ban on organized religion. The hostilities of World War I had increased tensions with ethnic Ukrainians, and Mennonites with family members living abroad were targeted during the [[Great Purge]]. Having suffered persecution by the Stalinist regime, many Mennonites came to identify with [[Adolf Hitler]], who opposed Stalin, and subscribed to [[Judeo-Bolshevism|conspiracy theories blaming the Jews for Communist crimes]]. As pacifists within an increasingly military regime under Stalin and then (after invasion of Ukraine and parts of Russia by Hitler) the Nazis, and as "Volga Germans" whose abuse Hitler had used as pretense to invade, Mennonites were subject to special pressure to join military units. Mennonites played a central role in exploiting slave labor at [[Stutthof concentration camp]], and some, recruited into SS units, served as guards at concentration camps or perpetrated [[Holocaust by bullets|massacres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themennonite.org/issues/15-3/articles/Mennonites_and_the_Holocaust |title=Mennonites and the Holocaust |publisher=Themennonite.org |accessdate=2014-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529024556/http://www.themennonite.org/issues/15-3/articles/Mennonites_and_the_Holocaust |archivedate=2014-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Mennonites were conscripted by force into German units as support and shock troops and some participated in exterminating or deporting families. Most history of this period is anecdotal and based on family memoirs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mennoniteheritagevillage.com/services/bookstore/mennonitesworld |title=Mennonites in The World |publisher=Mennonite Heritage Village |accessdate=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and letters from the Gulags.&lt;ref name="canadianchristianity1"/&gt; Peter Letkemann of University of Winnipeg characterizes the casualties and abuses of this period as "victims of terror and repression in the Soviet Union during the 40-year period from 1917-1956."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jms.uwinnipeg.ca/index.php/jms/article/viewFile/1282/1273 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529084318/https://jms.uwinnipeg.ca/index.php/jms/article/viewFile/1282/1273 |archivedate=2014-05-29 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; This would overlap somewhat with the "Siberian Germans" deported to that region who have lost touch entirely with the Mennonite mainstream worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Russia-Eurasia-China/Siberian-Germans-Orientation.html |title=Orientation - Siberian Germans |publisher=Everyculture.com |accessdate=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== North America ==

After 1870 about 18,000 Russian Mennonites, fearing [[conscription]] into military service and state influence on their education systems, emigrated to the Plains States of the US and the [[Western Canada|Western Provinces]] of Canada. The more liberal went in general to the US where the majority over a period of several decades assimilated more or less into the mainstream society.

[[File:alexanderwohl-church.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexanderwohl Mennonite Church]] near [[Goessel, Kansas]]]]
Russian Mennonites settled much of South Central [[Kansas]], which owes its reputation as a wheat-producing state in large measure to its early Mennonite settlers. Winter wheat was introduced to Kansas in 1873. The following year the Mennonites, who had experience with dry land farming in Russia, quickly took advantage of its characteristics, resulting in rapid expansion of the milling industry in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kshs.org/teachers/trunks/pdfs/wheat_00b_background.pdf Origins of winter wheat in Kansas] (Kansas State Historical Society)&lt;/ref&gt; It is planted in the fall and harvested in June and July of the following summer, and is therefore ideally suited to cold winters and the hot, dry Kansas summers. Kansas remains a top producer of wheat in America to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crop Profile for Wheat in Kansas|url=http://www.ipmcenters.org/cropprofiles/docs/kswheat.pdf|website=Regional IPM Centers - National IPM Database|publisher=NSF Center for Integrated Pest Management located at North Carolina State University|accessdate=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more conservative [[Old Colony Mennonites|Old Colony]] and [[Bergthal Colony|Bergthal Mennonites]] went to Canada which promised privileges equal to those previously held in Russia (no conscription into military service and German language private schools) and a large tract of land divided into two "Reserves". The Mennonites settled mostly in [[Manitoba]] in areas east and west of the [[Red River of the North|Red River]], called East Reserve and West Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mennonites: A Brief History of Their Origin and Later Development in Both Europe and America |author=C.

They brought with them many of their institutions and practices, especially their traditional settling pattern which meant that they settled in vast exclusively Mennonite areas where they formed villages with German names such as [[Blumenort, Manitoba|Blumenort]], [[Steinbach, Manitoba|Steinbach]] and [[Grunthal, Manitoba|Grünthal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Heritage Landscape of the Crow Wing Study Region |author=Edward M.

The more conservative faction of the Manitoba Mennonites decided to leave Canada after the [[World War I]] and moved to [[Mennonites in Mexico|Mexico]] mostly in the years 1922-1927 and to Paraguay in 1927. The main reason for that was compulsory attendance of public schools and [[anti-German sentiment]]s because of the war. Some latercomer went to Mexico in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gameo.org/index.php?title=Mexico ''Maxico''] at [[GAMEO]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gameo.org/index.php?title=Paraguay ''Paraguay''] at GAMEO.&lt;/ref&gt; After the more conservative fraction had left for Mexico, most the remaining Mennonites quickly assimilated into the mainstream society. 

Descendants of Manitoba Mennonites today form the majority of Conservative Mennonites in Latin America, counting more than 200,000. Because many of these Mennonites from Canada still hold Canadian passports, there was and still is a steady flow back to Canada fed by the high [[birth rate]]s of conservative Mennonites. These emigrants strengthen the Russian Mennonite element in the Canadian Mennonite churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Old_Colony_Mennonites&amp;oldid=113570|title=Old Colony Mennonites|website=Gameo.org|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Russian Mennonites came separate denominations previously unseen in North America, such as the [[Mennonite Brethren]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=C.

A second wave of Russian Mennonites came out of Russia after the bloody strife following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and a third wave in the aftermath of [[World War I]]. These people, having lost everything they had known, found their way to settlements in [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]], [[British Columbia]] and [[Ontario]] and in many regions of the United States.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Some joined with previous Mennonite groups, while others formed their own.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The emigration from Canada to [[Mennonites in Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Mennonites in Paraguay|Paraguay]] in the 1920s was a reaction to the introduction of universal, secular [[compulsory education]] in 1917 requiring the use of the English language, which the more conservative Mennonites saw as a threat to the religious basis of their community.

The first colony in a Latin American country was established by Mennonites from Canada between 1922 and 1925 in Mexico in the state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] near the city of [[Cuauhtémoc, Chihuahua|Cuauhtémoc]]. The next country was Paraguay, where [[Menno Colony]] was formed 1927 by Mennonites from Canada, whereas [[Fernheim Colony|Fernheim]] and Friesland Colonies were formed in the 1930s by Mennonites from the [[Soviet Union]] who were fleeing starvation ([[Holodomor]]), persecution of religion and [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Collectivization]] under [[Stalin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Antonio De La Cova |url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/paraguay/mennonites.htm |title=Paraguay's Mennonites resent 'fast buck' outsiders |publisher=Latinamericanstudies.org |date=1999-12-28 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuland Colony|Neuland]] and Volendam Colonies were founded 1947 by Mennonites who fled the Soviet Union at the end of [[World War II]]. All other Mennonite colonies in Latin America were formed by Mennonites who settled in North America since 1870, partly via Mexico and Belize.

Beginning in 1954 conservative Mennonites settled in East-Bolivia, in the [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz Department]]. Bolivia soon became the refuge for Mennonites who wanted to flee the influences of modern society. In 2006 there were 41 Mennonite colonies in Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/world/americas/21bolivia.html|title=Bolivian Reforms Raise Anxiety on Mennonite Frontier|first=Simon|last=Romero|date=21 December 2006|accessdate=11 January 2018|website=Nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old Colony Mennonites went from Mexico to Belize in 1959&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Belize&amp;oldid=122447|title=Belize - GAMEO|website=Gameo.org|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to Argentina in 1986.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6178">'''Radhi ud-Deen Ali ibn Musa ibn Tawus al Hasani wal Husaini''' (1193-1266 AD) commonly called '''Sayyed Ibn Tawus''' ([[Arabic]]: سید ابن طاووس) was a [[Shiite]] jurist, theologian, historian and  astrologer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matar|first1=Zeina|title=Ibn Ṭāwūs|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4020-4425-0_9244|website=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|pages=1121–1122|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4425-0_9244|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He was a descendant of [[Hasan ibn Ali]] through his father and a descendant of [[Husain ibn Ali]] through his mother. It is said that he met the twelfth Shiite imam, [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]] (869-present), who according to Shiites is living in occultation.&lt;ref name="Lohoof"&gt;{{cite book|author=Seyed Ibn Tâwûs|title=Lohoof (Sighs of Sorrow)|date=2006|publisher=Naba Cultural Organization|location=Teharn|translator= Husain Risvi|pages=11–12, 199–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He is known for his library and his numerous works which are still available in their original form and help us learn about the interests of [[Muslim]] scholars at the end of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] era.&lt;ref name="Kohlberg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kohlberg|first1=Etan|title=Medieval Muslim Scholar at Work: Ibn Tawus and His Library (Islamic Philosophy, Theology and Science)|date=1992|publisher=Brill Academic Pub|isbn=978-9004095496|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and family life==
Ibn Tawus was born on 15 [[Muharram]] 589 (21 January 1193) in [[Hilla]] and was named Tawus (peacock). One of his forefathers was a handsome man with ugly legs so his progeny too inherited the title from him.&lt;ref name="Lohoof"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohlberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davani"/&gt; During his first 14 years of his life he was brought up and taught under many teachers including his father and grandfather.&lt;ref name="Kohlberg"/&gt; Later on he married Zahra Khatoon the daughter of the Shia Vazir of Nâsir bin Zaidi and settled in [[Baghdad]]. Ibn Tawus apparently had good relations with the Caliphs of his time like [[Al-Mustansir (Baghdad)|Muntansir]], however he refused to be involved in any political affairs.&lt;ref name="Lohoof"/&gt; There is not exact information about his family and number of his children. His children were known by the name of their mother. It is said that he had returned to Hilla in 641 and had gone to [[Najaf]] in 645 and then to [[Karbala]] in 649 and to [[Samarra]] in 652 and on reaching Baghdad he stayed there until Mongols captured the city.&lt;ref name="Davani"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davani|first1=Ali|title=Razi al-Din Ibn Tawus|journal=Maktabe Islam|date=2012|issue=24|pages=51–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under the reign of Mongols==
When [[Hulagu Khan]] conquered [[Baghdad]], he asked the Scholars of the city : "Who is better, a tyrant Muslim ruler or a [[Kafir]](infidel)  judicious ruler?" None gave a response to this question but Ibn Tawus who said: "A Kâfir judicious is better." And the other scholars followed him in this reply. A reply that saved the life of many people in the city.  Afterwards Hulagu Khan let Ibn Tawus to return to Hilla.&lt;ref name="Lohoof"/&gt; However, Hulagu Khan gave the leadership of [[Alawites]] and then some cities like [[Baghdad]] to him which Ibn Tawus was reluctant to accept. [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] advised him to save his life by accepting it and he did so.&lt;ref name="Lohoof"/&gt;

==Works==
Ibn Tawus inherited a big library and he himself wrote numerous books on different topics from theology and ethics to jurisprudence and astronomy some of which have been translated into [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]] and [[English language|English]]. In his books he encouraged readers to learn about [[Muhammad]] and the [[Ahl al-Bayt]] because he thought such "knowledge about the original sources of religion was the actual understanding of religion". some of his works can be listed as follows:&lt;ref name="Lohoof"/&gt;

* ''Lohoof (Sighs of Sorrow)'' is among his works which relates the tragic events of Karbala and is translated into English.&lt;ref name="Lohoof"/&gt;
* ''Al-Muhajjal Samaratal Muhajja'' which is in ethic and encompasses his wills to his children and also different level of his life, in his own words.&lt;ref name="Davani"/&gt;
* Al-Muhimmat wa al-tatimmat in 10 volumes, and each volume has been published by an independent subject; such as, Falah al-sa'il, Zuhrat al-rabi' , Jamal al-usbu', Iqbal al-a'mal. Ibn Tawus has written this book as a complimentary to Misbah al-mutahajjid written by al-Shaykh al-Tusi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="963">In [[Etruscan mythology]], '''Sethlans''' was the god of fire, the forge, metalworking, and by extension craftsmanship in general, the equivalent, though their names share no etymology, to [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Hephaestus]], Egyptian [[Ptah]] and the Roman [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]. Sethlans is one of the indigenous Etruscan gods. In [[Etruscan art]]s Sethlans may be identified by his tools, the hammer and tongs of the blacksmith, and by the ''[[pileus (hat)|pileus]]'' or conical cap he wears.

By what appears to be a curious omission,&lt;ref&gt;Noted in this context by H.J. Rose, "The Cult of Volkanus at Rome", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'' '''23''' (1933:46-63)  p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; his name does not appear on the bronze [[liver of Piacenza]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23750">Various '''sociological classifications of religious movements''' have been proposed by scholars. In the [[sociology of religion]], the most widely used classification  is the church-sect [[wikt:typology|typology]]. The typology states that churches, ecclesia, denominations and sects form a continuum with decreasing influence on society. Sects are break-away groups from more mainstream religions and tend to be in tension with society.

Cults and [[new religious movement]]s fall outside this continuum and in contrast to aforementioned groups often have a novel teaching. They have been classified on their attitude towards society and the level of involvement of their adherents.

== Church-sect typology ==
[[File:Church-sect continuum.svg|right|thumb|400px|A diagram of the church-sect typology continuum. Include church, denomination, sect, cult, new religious movement, and institutionalized sect.]]
This church-sect typology has its origins in the work of [[Max Weber]].&lt;ref name="Dawson2006p26"&gt;{{cite book | last=Dawson | first=Lorne L. | title=Comprehending Cults: The Sociology of New Religious Movements | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-19-542009-8 | page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic premise is that there is a continuum along which religions fall, ranging from the protest-like orientation of ''[[sects]]'' to the equilibrium maintaining ''churches''. Along this continuum are several additional types, each of which will be discussed in turn.

Many labels are commonly employed by non-sociologists to refer to religions and tend to be used interchangeably. Sociologists, when speaking technically, will not use these labels interchangeably as they are designations for religions with very specific characteristics.

These differing religions are often classified by sociologists as ''[[ideal type]]s''. Ideal types are ''pure'' examples of the categories. Because there is significant variation in each religion, how closely an individual religion actually holds as their ''ideal type'' categorisation will vary. Nevertheless, the categorisation scheme is useful as it also outlines a sort of developmental process for religions.

===Church and ecclesia===
Johnstone provides the following seven characteristics of churches:&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone. 1997. Religion in Society: A Sociology of Religion. Upper Sadle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Claim universality, include all members of the society within their ranks, and have a strong tendency to equate "citizenship" with "membership"
* Exercise religious monopoly and try to eliminate religious competition
* Are very closely allied with the state and secular powers; frequently there is overlapping of responsibilities and much mutual reinforcement
* Are extensively organized as a hierarchical bureaucratic institution with a complex division of labor
* Employ professional, full-time clergy who possess the appropriate credentials of education and formal ordination
* Primarily gain new members through natural reproduction and the socialization of children into the ranks
* Allow for diversity by creating different groups within the church (e.g., orders of nuns or monks) rather than through the formation of new religions

The classical example of a ''church'' by this definition is the [[Catholic Church]], especially in the past, such as the [[State church of the Roman Empire]]. Today, the Catholic Church has been forced into the denomination category because of [[religious pluralism]], or competition among religions. This is especially true of Catholicism in the United States. The change from a ''church'' to a ''denomination'' is still under way in many Latin American countries where the majority of citizens remain Catholics.

[[Islam]] is a church in countries like [[Saudi Arabia]] and Iran, where there is no [[separation of church and state]]. The [[Basic Law of Saudi Arabia]] states: "[The Constitution of Saudi Arabia is] [[Qur'an|God's Book]] [the Qur'an] and the [[Sunnah]] of [[Muhammad|His Prophet]] [Muhammad]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://saudinf.com/main/c541.htm The Basic Law - Saudi Arabia Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; These nations are ruled under an official interpretation of [[religious law]] (''[[Salafi]]'' in the case of Saudi Arabia), and the religious law predominates the legal system. Saudi Arabia, however, lacks Johnstone's criteria for an ordained clergy and a strictly hierarchical structure, although it has the ''[[ulema]]''. In the [[Shi'a]] denominations, there is a professional clergy led by a [[Grand Ayatollah]].

A slight modification of the ''church'' type is that of ''ecclesia''.&lt;ref&gt;von Wiese 1932&lt;/ref&gt; Ecclesias include the above characteristics of churches with the exception that they are generally less successful at garnering absolute adherence among all of the members of the society and are not the sole religious body. The [[state church]]es of some European nations would fit this type.

===Denominations===
{{main|Religious denomination}}
The ''denomination'' lies between the church and the sect on the continuum. Denominations come into existence when churches lose their religious monopoly in a society. A denomination is one religion among many. When churches or sects become denominations, there are also some changes in their characteristics. Johnstone provides the following eight characteristics of denominations:
# similar to churches, but unlike sects, in being on relatively good terms with the state and secular powers and may even attempt to influence government at times
# maintain at least tolerant and usually fairly friendly relationships with other denominations in a context of [[religious pluralism]]
# rely primarily on birth for membership increase, though it will also accept converts; some actively pursue evangelization
# accept the principle of at least modestly changing doctrine and practice and tolerate some theological diversity and dispute
# follow a fairly routinized ritual and worship service that explicitly discourages spontaneous emotional expression
# train and employ professional clergy who must meet formal requirements for certification
# accept less extensive involvement from members than do sects, but more involvement than churches
# often draw disproportionately from the middle and upper classes of society

Most of the major Christian bodies formed post-reformation are denominations by this definition (e.g., [[Baptists]], [[Methodist]]s, [[Lutheran]]s, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dawson | first=Lorne L. | title=Comprehending Cults: The Sociology of New Religious Movements | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-19-542009-8 | page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sects===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
{{main|Sect}}
Sociologically, a "sect" is defined as a newly formed religious group that formed to protest elements of its parent religion (generally a [[Religious denomination|denomination]]). Their motivation tends to be situated in accusations of [[apostasy]] or [[heresy]] in the parent denomination; they often decry liberal trends in denominational development and advocate a return to so-called "true" religion.

Leaders of sectarian movements (i.e., the formation of a new sect) tend to come from a lower socio-economic class than the members of the parent denomination, a component of sect development that is not yet entirely understood. Most scholars believe that when sect formation involves social class distinctions, they reflect an attempt to compensate for deficiencies in lower social status.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} An often seen result of such factors is the incorporation into the theology of the new sect a distaste for the adornments of the wealthy (e.g., jewelry or other signs of wealth).

After their formation, sects can take only three paths - dissolution, institutionalization, or eventual development into a denomination. If the sect withers in membership, it will dissolve. If the membership increases, the sect is forced to adopt the characteristics of denominations in order to maintain order (e.g., bureaucracy, explicit doctrine, etc.). And even if the membership does not grow or grows slowly, norms will develop to govern group activities and behavior. The development of norms results in a decrease in spontaneity, which is often one of the primary attractions of sects. The adoption of denomination-like characteristics can either turn the sect into a full-blown denomination or, if a conscious effort is made to maintain some of the spontaneity and protest components of sects, an ''institutionalized sect'' can result. Institutionalized sects are halfway between sects and denominations on the continuum of religious development. They have a mixture of sect-like and denomination-like characteristics. Examples include: [[Hutterites]], [[Iglesia ni Cristo]], and the [[Amish]].

Most of the well-known denominations of the U.S. existing today originated as sects breaking away from denominations (or Churches, in the case of [[Lutheranism]] and [[Anglicanism]]). Examples include: [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Baptists]], and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]].

An example of an institutionalized sect that did not become a denomination are the [[Mennonites]]. 

==Cult typology==
{{main|Cult}}
The concept of "cult" has lagged behind in the refinement of the terms that are used in analyzing the other forms of religious origination. Bruce Campbell discusses Troeltsch's concept in defining cults as non-traditional religious groups that are based on belief in a divine element within the individual. He gives three ideal types of cults:

# a mystically-oriented illumination type
# an instrumental type, in which inner experience is sought solely for its effects
# a service-oriented type that is focused on aiding others.

He also gives six groups in the applications of analysis:  Theosophy, Wisdom of the Soul, Spiritualism, New Thought, Scientology, and Transcendental Meditation.

In the late nineteenth century, there have been a number of works that help in clarifying what is involved in cults.&lt;ref name="Bruce Campbell 1978"&gt;Bruce Campbell (1978). "A Typology of Cults." ''Sociology Analysis'', Santa Barbara&lt;/ref&gt; There are several scholars of this subject, such as Joseph Campbell and Bruce Campbell, who have noted that cults are associated with beliefs in a divine element in the individual. It is either Soul, Self, or True Self.  Cults are inherently ephemeral and loosely organized.&lt;ref name="Bruce Campbell 1978"/&gt; There is a major theme in many of the recent works that show the relationship between cults and mysticism.&lt;ref name="Bruce Campbell 1978"/&gt; Campbell brings two major types of cults to attention. One is mystical and the other is instrumental.  This can divide the cults into being either occults or metaphysical assemblies.

On the basis that Campbell proposes about cults, they are non-traditional religious groups based on belief in a divine element in the individual.  Other than the two main  types, there is also a third type.  This is service-oriented. Campbell states that "the kinds of stable forms which evolve in the development of religious organization will bear a significant relationship to the content of the religious experience of the founder or founders." &lt;ref&gt;Bruce Campbell (1978). "A Typology of Cults." ''Sociology Analysis'', Santa Barbara.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cults or new religious movements{{Anchor|Cults or New Religious Movements}} ===
By sociological typology, ''cults'' are, like sects, new religious groups. But, unlike sects, they can form without breaking off from another religious group, though this is by no means always the case. The characteristic that most distinguishes cults from sects is that they are not advocating a return to ''pure'' religion but rather the embracing of something new or something that has been completely lost or forgotten (e.g., lost scriptures or new prophecy). Cults are also much more likely to be led by [[charismatic authority|charismatic leaders]] than are other religious groups and the charismatic leaders tend to be the individuals who bring forth the new or lost component that is the focal element of the cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dawson | first=Lorne L. | title=Comprehending Cults: The Sociology of New Religious Movements | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-19-542009-8 | pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cults, like sects, often integrate elements of existing religious theologies, but cults tend to create more esoteric theologies synthesized from many sources. Cults tend to emphasize the individual and individual peace.

Cults, like sects, can develop into denominations. As cults grow, they bureaucratize and develop many of the characteristics of denominations. Some scholars are hesitant to grant cults denominational status because many cults maintain their more esoteric characteristics. But given their closer semblance to denominations than to the ''cult'' type, it is more accurate to describe them as denominations.  Some denominations in the US that began as cults include [[Christian Science]] and the [[Nation of Islam]].

Finally, there is a push in the social [[scientific study of religion]] to begin referring to ''cults'' as ''New Religious Movements'' (NRMs). This is the result of the often pejorative and derogatory meanings attached to the word "''cult''" in popular language.

&lt;/ref&gt; notes the many attempts to draw a classification or typology of cults and/or [[sect]]s, but concludes that the divergences that exist in these groups' practices, doctrines, and goals do not lend themselves to a simple classification that has universal approval. He argues that the influx of Eastern religious systems, including [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Shintoism]], which do not fit within the traditional distinctions between church, sect, denomination and cult, have compounded typological difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;

==Wallis' distinction between cults and sects==
The sociologist [[Roy Wallis]] (1945–1990) introduced differing definitions of [[sect]]s and [[cult]]s. He argued that a cult is characterized by "[[epistemology|epistemological]] individualism" by which he means that "the cult has no clear locus of final authority beyond the individual member." According to Wallis, cults are generally described as "oriented towards the problems of individuals, loosely structured, tolerant, non-exclusive", making "few demands on members", without possessing a "clear distinction between members and non-members", having "a rapid turnover of membership", and are transient collectives with vague boundaries and fluctuating belief systems. Wallis asserts that cults emerge from the "cultic milieu." Wallis contrasts a cult with a [[sect]] in that he asserts that sects are characterized by "[[epistemology|epistemological]] authoritarianism": sects possess some authoritative locus for the legitimate attribution of heresy. According to Wallis, "sects lay a claim to possess unique and privileged access to the truth or salvation, such as [[Collective Salvation|collective salvation]], and their committed adherents typically regard all those outside the confines of the collectivity as 'in error'."&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy ''[[The Road to Total Freedom A Sociological analysis of Scientology]]'' (1976) [http://whyaretheydead.net/krasel/books/wallis/wallis1.html available online (bad scan)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405052348/http://whyaretheydead.net/krasel/books/wallis/wallis1.html |date=2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy ''Scientology: Therapeutic Cult to Religious Sect'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20060614094446/http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/1/89 abstract only] (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult and/or new religious movements==

=== Stark and Bainbridge ===
In 1975, the sociologists [[Rodney Stark]] and [[William Sims Bainbridge]]&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/NRM.htm |title=New Religious Movements |accessdate=2007-07-21 |last=Bromley |first=David |work=Encyclopedia of Religion and Society edited by William H. Swatos, Jr. Editor |publisher=Altamira press}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguish three types of [[cult]]s, classified on the basis of the levels of organizational and [[customer|client]] (or adherent) involvement:&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saliba pages 140-141"&gt;[[John Saliba|Saliba, John]] [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] ''Understanding new religious movements'' second edition 2003 {{ISBN|0-7591-0356-9}} Altamira press, pages 140-141
&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Audience cults'' which have hardly any organization because participants/consumers lack significant involvement.
* ''Client cults'', in which the service-providers exhibit a degree of organization in contrast to their clients. Client cults link into moderate-commitment social networks through which people exchange [[goods and services]]. The relationship between clients and the [[leadership|leader]]s of client cults resembles that of patients and therapists.
* ''Cult movements'', which seek to provide services that meet all of their adherents' spiritual needs, although they differ significantly in the degree to which they use mobilize adherents' time and commitment.

The sociologist [[Paul Schnabel]] has argued that the [[Church of Scientology]] originated from an ''audience cult'' (the readership of Hubbard's book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' and the ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' article which had preceded it) into a ''client cult'' ([[Dianetics]]) then into a cult movement (the Church of Scientology).&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Schnabel|Schnabel, Paul]] ''Tussen stigma en charisma: nieuwe religieuze bewegingen en geestelijke volksgezondheid''/''Between stigma and charisma: new religious movements and mental health'' [[Erasmus University]] Rotterdam, Faculty of Medicine, Ph.D. thesis, Dutch language, {{ISBN|90-6001-746-3}} (Deventer, Van Loghum Slaterus, 1982), pages 82, 84-88 &lt;br&gt;literal English translation: "Scientology is a fully developed innovative cult movement [...] Scientology grew out of a client cult (Dianetic) and an audience cult (Hubbard's books)"&lt;br&gt;Dutch original: "Scientology is een volledig ontwikkelde innovatieve cult movement [...] Scientology is voortgekomen uit een client cult (Dianetics) en een audience cult (de boeken van Hubbard)."&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''World-rejecting movements'' view the prevailing social order as deviant and a perversion of the divine plan. Such movements see the world as evil or at least as [[Economic materialism|materialistic]]. They may adhere to [[millenarianism|millenarian]] beliefs. The [[International Society of Krishna Consciousness]] (a.k.a. "Hare Krishnas"), the [[Unification Church]], the [[Brahma Kumaris]] and the [[Family International|Children of God]] exemplify world-rejecting movements.
* ''World-accommodating movements'' draw clear distinctions between the spiritual and the worldly spheres. They have few or no consequences for the lives of adherents. These movements adapt to the world but they do not reject or affirm it.
* ''World-affirming movements'' might not have any [[ritual]]s or any formal [[ideology]]. They may lack most of the characteristics of religious movements. They affirm the world and merely claim to have the means to enable people to unlock their "[[Human Potential Movement|hidden potential]]". As examples of world-affirming movements, Wallis mentions [[Werner Erhard]]'s [[Erhard Seminars Training|est]] and [[Transcendental Meditation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2843">The '''Sri Sathya Sai Baba Center of Manhattan''' (also referred to as the Manhattan Sai Center or Manhattan Sai Baba Center) is a Sai Center within the USA [[Sathya Sai Organization]] running out of the borough of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. Under the direction of [[Sathya Sai Baba]], it was established in 1976 as a service organization to run devotional programs and service projects. Their projects have been covered by several New York news outlets.&lt;ref name="newyorkproject"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.feetintwoworlds.org/2012/03/30/inspired-by-spiritual-leader-immigrant-community-cooks-vegetarian-food-for-nyc-homeless/ |accessdate=April 2, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402223514/http://news.feetintwoworlds.org/2012/03/30/inspired-by-spiritual-leader-immigrant-community-cooks-vegetarian-food-for-nyc-homeless/ |archivedate=April 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their Healthy Harlem Food Service runs every Wednesday evening in Harlem and feeds up to 200 people for free each week. Their Bowery Food Service and River Food Service projects run every Saturday and similarly feed over 300 people for free. Other projects include monthly services in the [[Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital]] for both new and old patients and these are run completely by volunteer effort.&lt;ref name="hospitals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sajaforum.org/2008/12/philanthropy-holiday-season-service-projects.html|title=SAJAforum|work=sajaforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Template-Territorial Abbot.svg|thumb|The [[coat of arms]] of a territorial abbot are distinguished by a green [[galero]] with twelve tassels and a gold [[crozier]] with a veil attached.]]
A '''territorial abbey''' (or '''territorial abbacy''') is a [[particular church]] of the [[Catholic Church]] comprising defined territory which is not part of a [[diocese]] but surrounds an [[abbey]] or [[monastery]] whose  [[abbot]] or [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]] functions as [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] for all Catholics and [[Parish (Catholic Church)|parish]]es in the territory. Such an abbot is called a '''territorial abbot''' or '''abbot ''nullius diœceseos''''' (abbreviated '''abbot ''nullius''''' and Latin for "abbot of no diocese"). A territorial abbot thus differs from an ordinary abbot, who exercises authority only within the monastery's walls or to [[monk]]s or [[Canons Regular|canon]]s who have taken their [[religious vows|vows]] there. A territorial abbot is [[Catholic Church hierarchy#Equivalents of diocesan bishops in law|equivalent to a bishop]] in [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|Catholic canon law]].

While most belong to the [[Latin Church]], and usually to the [[Benedictine Order|Benedictine]]  or Cistercian Orders, there are Eastern Catholic territorial abbeys — most notably the Italo-Greek Abbey of [[Grottaferrata]].

== History ==
The practice arose in part because abbeys served the spiritual needs of Catholics who lived near the monastery, especially in mission territories. The monastery's own chapel was a space of public worship for the [[laity]] who had settled nearby, and the monks could also serve as [[parish]] [[clergy]] in [[Church (building)|church]]es near the monastery. The abbot of the monastery, although having received only the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] in the [[sacrament]] of [[Holy Orders]], was invested with the same administrative authority under [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] as a diocesan bishop for a given territory around the abbey. Thus, with the exception of conferring ordination on priests, the territorial abbot could do almost everything a diocesan bishop would for those under his care, including [[Incardination and excardination|incardinate]] (that is, enroll under his jurisdiction) even non-monastic priests and [[deacon]]s for service in parishes. The territorial abbot, like other abbots and archabbots, had the right to use an episcopal coat of arms and to wear the [[mitre]], the [[crosier]], the ring, and the [[pectoral cross]]; if the abbot had been ordained to the episcopacy (very rare), he had the power to ordain his religious who were candidates to the transitional and permanent diaconate and to the priesthood, though they usually had to attend a seminary house of formation located outside the abbot's territory. 

Though territorial (like other) abbots are elected by the monks of their abbey, a territorial abbot can only receive the abbatial blessing and be installed under mandate from the [[pope]], just as a bishop cannot be ordained and installed as ordinary of a diocese without such a mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Monasticism|last=Johnston|first=William M. ed.|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|year=2000|isbn=1579580904|location=Chicago|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second Vatican Council]], more emphasis has been placed on the unique nature of the episcopacy and on the traditional organization of the church into dioceses under bishops. As such, abbeys ''nullius'' have been phased out in favor of the erection of new dioceses or the absorption of the territory into an existing diocese. A few ancient abbeys nullius still exist in Europe, and one in Korea.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/10/23/vatican_announces_reorganisation_of_montecassino_abbey/1109281|title=Vatican announces reorganisation of Montecassino Abbey|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abbot of Waegwan is the present apostolic administrator of the Tŏkwon abbacy. It has not been united with any diocese throughout Korea due to the effective vacancy of the ones in North Korea and the lack of effective jurisdiction applied by the Church in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/data/type-abby.htm|title=Catholic Dioceses in the World (Territorial Abbacies)|website=www.gcatholic.org|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Model van een zielenboot TMnr 4946-1.jpg|thumb|right|A model of the spirit ship that is said to conduct the ''liau'' of the dead to the land of the dead where they would meet the ancestors.]] 
'''[[Tiwah download|Tiwah]]''' is the [[Festival of the Dead]] of the [[Ngaju people]] of [[Central Kalimantan]]. It is basically a secondary mortuary rituals, where the bones of the deceased are taken from the cemeteries, purified and finally placed in an [[ossuary]]. The feast celebrates the final entry of the deceased into paradise where they would meet the ancestors.

==''Liau''==
The Ngaju practiced a syncretic religion known as the [[Kaharingan]]. To conform with the principle of the Indonesian state ideology of "One Supreme God" (''Ketuhanan yang Maha Esa''), in 1980 the Kaharingan faithful of the Ngaju people agreed to establish themselves under the Hindu-Kaharingan faith to be recognized as an official religion of Indonesia.

The Ngaju people regard human as comprising the physical body, animated by a 'soul' or 'spirit' known as the ''hambaruan''. Death means that the ''hambaruan'' leaves the body permanently and ceases to exist. The physical body is then replaced by something called ''liau'', which can be described as the 'spirit' of the corpse. ''Liau'' is divided into three parts: the ''liau'' of the bones, the ''liau'' of the flesh and blood, and the ''liau'' of  the "spirit of the intellect". The bone ''liau'' is deemed to have been derived from the deceased's father, associated with the upperworld and the upperworld's male deity. The flesh and blood ''liau'' is derived from the deceased's mother, and is associated with the underworld and the underworld's female deity. These first two ''liau''s remain with the corpse, and until the tiwah is enacted, they remain in the underworld. The third "spirit of the intellect" ''liau'' remain in a place in the third heaven. This ''liau'' however is a potential threat as they can roam the human world, and so this ''liau'' must be dealth with. At a ritual called ''tantulak liau'' ("expelling the dead soul"), Ngaju priests (''basir'') would call upon one of the upperworld spirits (''sangiang'') to escort this ''liau'' to a heavenly village in the third heaven. This ''liau'' must remain there until the tiwah.{{sfn|Metcalf|1999|p=135}}

==Tiwah feast==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een koppensneller met aan zijn gordel een schedel die bij feesten gebruikt wordt om uit te drinken een vrouw met een grote 'blangai' pot en achter hen palen voor het dodenfeest 'Tiwah' Borneo TMnr 10002945.jpg|thumb|left|The pole carved with a face in the background represents the Raja Entai Nyahu, which is thought to watches over the dead until the tiwah.]]
The feast of Tiwah concerns with the reunion of the three ''liau''s on earth for the last time before being escorted away to ''Lewa Liau'', the paradise. Tiwah feast is a large and lengthy feast consisting of many ceremonies, each with specific aims. One ceremony invites the various upperworld spirits to join in the celebrations, while other ensures that the living are kept safe during this potentially dangerous period. Each ceremonies requires sacrifice of livestock and so large numbers of livestock such as buffaloes and pigs are sacrificed during Tiwah. The animals are tied to a [[sapundu]] sacrificial pole, killed, its blood is used to purify multiple objects used during the tiwah. Offering is given to the dead and to the spirits invited to the ceremony. They take the essence of the offerings, while the human guests at the ''tiwah'' consume the physical part of the offering. Separate ceremonies are held to bring the bones from the cemetery, the bones are carried back to the village to be cleaned and anointed with oil and gold dust by their closest kin e.g. their children or their grandchildren; the anointed bones are then carefully wrapped in cloth and returned to the ''[[sandung]]'' where they will remain until the end of the tiwah. The ''sandung'' or bone houses are large house-like structures built to house the bones. Another ceremony bring the ''liau'' back from the third heaven where it has been residing.{{sfn|Metcalf|1999|p=135}}

The main event of the Tiwah takes place at a ceremony where the reunited ''liau'' is escorted by the ''sangiang'' [[psychopomp]] named Rawing Tempun Telun, to Lewu Liau. During this ceremony, which lasts all night, a [[Mediumship|medium]] called a ''tukang hanteran'' or ''mahanteran'' ("adept at escorting (the dead)") allows the ''sangiang'' Rawing Tempun Telun to possess him. The ''mahanteran'' would sit above the gong and dress up like the Rawing Tempun Telun, wearing a certain headdress, feathers of a hornbill, shell tunic and boars teeth belt, and holding a [[Mandau (knife)|mandau]] (heirloom sword). The words of the ''mahanteran'' during this period are considered those of the ''sangiang''. The ''mahanteran'' would recite the entire creation myth of the Ngaju throughout the night. As the story commenced, it is deemed that in the spirit world, the ''liau'' would make their way to paradise in spirit boats, traveling along the rivers of the upperworld until they arrive at Lewu Liau in the seventh heaven. Lewu Liau is reached as the recitation of the creation myth finishes.{{sfn|Metcalf|1999|p=135}}

The recital of the creation myth is believed to restore order to the chaos caused by the death of a person. Ngaju people believes that death creates disorder and destruction of the cosmos, which must be continually recreated if life is to continue. By allowing the ''sangiang'' to possess the ''tukang hanteran'' and recite the creation myth, the cosmos is being restored.{{sfn|Metcalf|1999|p=135}}

===Practice of the Tiwah===
The feast of Tiwah is most important ceremony of the Ngaju people, even more important than the primary funeral which is performed right after the death. Tiwah festival is essential for the soul's journey to reach the highest level in heaven. Tiwah is held after several months or years after the burial. Tiwah feast is a big, complex, costly, and long lasting event. One event costs anywhere between USD$6,000 to $180,000; and may last from three days to forty days, depending on the amount of souls are being sent off to the afterlife. It is common that several families hold a tiwah together so they can spread the cost of sacrificed animals. At one time, more than two hundred souls brought to a higher level in one ceremony. The council registers and coordinates all tiwah event before asking the police for a permit. Normally there are two to ten tiwah festivals in one years.{{sfn|Metcalf|Brookes|2014}}

Tiwah is a festive event. There is active participation at Tiwah ceremony by Christian and some Muslim members of the community. Since Islam and the religion of [[Kaharingan]] are fundamentally irreconcilable as social ideologies, this has led to a great number of people practicing double or even multiple loyalties. An elder Dayak quotes that "Religion (''agama'') honors God; our traditional beliefs (''kepercayaan'') honor our ancestors".{{sfn|Aritonang|Steenbrink|2008|p=498}}{{failed verification|reason=This quotation has been butchered from what the source says (ot's a close paraphrase, but still a paraphrase): was it taken from a different source?|date=December 2017}} Tiwah is quite regular in main towns of Kalimantan, such as in [[Palangkaraya]]. Food stalls and open-air market shops are set during the Tiwah. Gambling boards are also frequent during the Tiwah.{{sfn|Metcalf|Brookes|2014}}

"'''What Is Theosophy?'''" is an editorial published in October 1879 in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] magazine ''[[The Theosophist]].'' It was compiled by [[Helena Blavatsky]]{{refn|group=note|''The Theosophist,'' Vol. 1, No. 1, October, 1879, pp. 2–5.{{sfn|Index}}}} and included into the 2nd volume of the ''Blavatsky Collected Writings.''{{sfn|Blavatsky|1967}} According to a doctoral thesis by Tim Rudbøg, in this "important" article Blavatsky "began conceptualizing her idea of '[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]'."{{sfn|Rudbøg|2012|p=102}}

== Analysis of contents ==
=== Definition of Theosophy ===
Blavatsky writes that, "according to [[Lexicography|lexicographers]], the term ''theosophia'' is composed of two Greek words—''theos'' "god," and ''sophos'' "wise."{{sfn|Britannica}}{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=2|Rudbøg|2012|2p=102}} She then writes that [[Noah Webster]] defines it as "a supposed intercourse with God and superior spirits, and consequent attainment of superhuman knowledge, by ''physical processes,'' as by the [[Theurgy|theurgic]] operations of some ancient [[Platonists]], or by the ''chemical processes'' of the German [[Alchemy|fire-philosophers]]."{{sfnm|Webster|1877|1p=1373|Blavatsky|1879|2p=2|Santucci|2012|3p=233|Rudbøg|2012|4p=98}}{{refn|group=note|Santucci has specified that it mentions here "the theurgy of the [[Neoplatonists]], such as [[Iamblichus]], and the fire-philosophers," who were described, for example, by [[Hargrave Jennings]].{{sfn|Santucci|2012|p=233}}}} Professor James Santucci wrote that the article author considers this interpretation unsuccessful, calling it "a poor and flippant explanation."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=2|Santucci|2012|2p=233}}{{refn|group=note|Blavatsky then explains a term "Theosophy," describing who a Theosophist is. To this aim, she uses Vaughan's definition.{{sfn|Rudbøg|2012|p=120}}}} In hers opinion, [[Robert Alfred Vaughan|Robert Vaughan]] has proposed "a far better, more philosophical" definition: "A Theosophist is one who gives you a theory of God or the works of God, which has not revelation, but an inspiration of his own for its basis."{{sfnm|Vaughan|1856|1p=45|Blavatsky|1879|2p=2|Santucci|2012|3p=234|Rudbøg|2012|4p=120}}{{refn|group=note|Both Santucci and Rudbøg did not notice that Blavatsky inexactly quotes Vaughan: there must be a word "reason" instead of "revelation."}} She continues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In this view every great thinker and philosopher, especially every founder of a new religion, school of philosophy, or sect, is necessarily a Theosophist. Hence, Theosophy and Theosophists have existed ever since the first glimmering of nascent thought made man seek instinctively for the means of expressing his own independent opinions."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=2|Sender|2007|2p=102|Rudbøg|2012|3p=120}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Both [[Alexander Senkevich]] and Tim Rudbøg stated that, to fully define Theosophy, Blavatsky proposes to consider it "under all its aspects."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Сенкевич|2012|2p=348|Rudbøg|2012|3p=120}} Both Santucci and Rudbøg have quoted in the article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The interior world has not been hidden from all by impenetrable darkness. By that higher intuition acquired by ''Theosophia''—or God-knowledge, which carries the mind from the world of form into that of formless [[spirit]], man has been sometimes enabled in every age and every country to perceive things in the interior or invisible world."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Santucci|2012|2p=234|Rudbøg|2012|3p=120}}{{refn|group=note|[[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] wrote that, according to the explanation of Blavatsky, hers Theosophy "is not a religion, but it is divine knowledge or science," and the very term applies not to God, but to the gods or to any divine being, and it is not God's wisdom, but the divine wisdom, i. e. that belongs to the gods at all.{{sfn|Соловьёв|1911|p=287}}}}{{refn|group=note|Origin of this term, according to the founders of [Blavatskian] Theosophy, goes back to the schools of the Neoplatonists, but the earliest elements of Theosophy were formed in ancient India, and a word "Theosophy" have its [[Sanskrit]] equivalent—"[[Brahmavidya]]" (Divine Wisdom).{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Santucci wrote that among the Theosophical ancestors, mentioned further by the article author, were the Hindu ascetics, the [[Neoplatonists]], the [[Rosicrucians]] or [[Alchemy|Fire-philosophers]], and other [[mysticism|mystics]]. According to Blavatsky, they were all involved in "the search after man's [[Ātman (Hinduism)|diviner 'self']]," which accompanied the theurgy she described. Santucci stated that, according to [[Iamblichus]], theurgy is, as Blavatsky points in hers article, "the art of applying the divine powers of man to the subordination of the blind forces of nature."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Santucci|2012|2p=234}} This "search" was often viewed "as individual communion with a personal God", and although this was not true, it was the aim of every mystic at all times.{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Сенкевич|2012|2p=348}}{{refn|group=note|The inner divinity is referred [in Theosophy] to by different names: the Uncreate, the inner God, the higher Self, and the Master; alliance with this divine self induces wisdom.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=49}}}}

Senkevich wrote that the article author quotes [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|F.R.S.]], a [[spiritualist]] who, as she writes, "with brave candour" claimed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is 'spirit' that alone feels, and perceives, and thinks—that acquires knowledge, and reasons and aspires... there not unfrequently occur individuals so constituted that the spirit can perceive independently of the corporeal organs of sense, or can perhaps, wholly or partially, quit the body for a time and return to it again... the spirit... communicates with spirit easier than with matter."{{sfnm|Wallace|1866|1pp=42, 43|Blavatsky|1879|2p=4|Сенкевич|2012|3p=348}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Santucci stated that Theosophy or "Divine Wisdom", according to Blavatsky, is the Highest Truth about God, the universe and man, "It is a Truth that in its pure form is primordial, in that it existed from the dawn of Humanity; [[esoteric]], since only those few individuals capable of understanding such knowledge are allowed to receive it; and universal, because all great minds throughout the world enunciated the same Wisdom."{{sfn|Santucci|1989|p=41}} Rudbøg wrote that this article is the first example in which Blavatsky's "concept of a 'Wisdom-Religion' is directly correlated with 'Theosophy'." He quoted: "Theosophy is, then, the archaic ''Wisdom-Religion,'' the esoteric doctrine once known in every ancient country having claims to civilization."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Rudbøg|2012|2p=105}}{{sfn|Santucci|1989|p=41}}{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|p=24}}{{refn|group=note|[[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]] wrote: "German [[pietism]] expressed fundamentally Theosophic ideas through [[Meister Eckhart|Eckhardt]], [[Johannes Tauler|Tauler]], [[Henry Suso|Suso]], and [[Jacob Boehme]]... In fact there was hardly a period when the ghosts of [[occult]] wisdom did not hover in the background of European thought."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=15}}}} Both Tim Rudbøg and Julia Shabanova have cited Blavatsky's definition of Theosophy as the Wisdom-Religion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This 'Wisdom' all the old writings show us as an emanation of the divine Principle; and the clear comprehension of it is typified in such names as the Indian [[Budha]], the Babylonian [[Nabu|Nebo]], the [[Thoth]] of Memphis, the [[Hermes]] of Greece; in the appellations, also, of some goddesses—[[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], [[Neith]]a, [[Athena]], the [[Gnostic]] ''[[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]],'' and finally the [[Vedas]], from the word 'to know'."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Rudbøg|2012|2p=108|Шабанова|2016|3p=24}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Basic idea of Theosophy ===
James Santucci wrote that Theosophy, according to Blavatsky, "refers to a nexus of teachings associated with the Supreme, the macrocosmos (the universe or Nature), and microcosmos (humanity)." He noted that in hers article she first presents the statement on "a single Supreme Essence, Unknown and ''Unknowable''" which was the "central idea of the [[Eclecticism|Eclectic]] Theosophy."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Santucci|2012|2p=234|Шабанова|2016|3p=24}}{{refn|group=note|This statement was later developed by the author in the proem to ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' where it is said that there is "an Omnipresent, Eternal, Boundless, and Immutable Principle on which all speculation is impossible, since it transcends the power of human conception and could only be dwarfed by any human expression or similitude."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888|1p=14|Santucci|2012|2p=234|Шабанова|2016|3p=91}}}}{{refn|group=note|In ''[[:ru:Новая философская энциклопедия|The New Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' it is said Blavatsky's Theosophy is a "mystical-religious doctrine based on faith in [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] as Unfathomable God, on the law of [[karma]], [[reincarnation]] of soul, and an idea of infinite cosmic evolution."{{sfn|Митюгова|2010}}}}

Professor Julia Shabanova wrote that an idea of Theosophy was not alien to [[German idealism]], with which were traditionally associated [[rationalism]] and even [[panlogism]]; this is about "that Theosophy which", as Blavatsky argues, "prompted such men as [[Hegel]], [[Fichte]] and [[Spinoza]] to take up the labors of the old Grecian philosophers and speculate upon the One Substance—the Deity, the ''Divine All'' proceeding from the Divine Wisdom—incomprehensible, unknown and ''unnamed''—by any ancient or modern religious philosophy."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Шабанова|2016|2p=18}}{{refn|group=note|[[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] used the term "Theosophy" to designate the synthesis of mystical cognition of God and rational philosophy; together it is possible here to refer the concept of "free Theosophy" by [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]].{{sfn|Теософия|2010}}}} Having mentioned these manifestations of Theosophy, the article author declares:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Every Theosophist, then, holding to a theory of the Deity 'which has not revelation, but an inspiration of his own for its basis,' may accept any of the above definitions or belong to any of these religions, and yet remain strictly within the boundaries of Theosophy. For the latter is belief in the Deity as the '''All''', the source of all existence, the infinite that cannot be either comprehended or known, the universe alone revealing ''It,'' or, as some prefer it, Him, thus giving a sex to that, to anthropomorphize which is ''blasphemy''."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=3|Movement|1951|2p=72}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shabanova wrote that Blavatsky points to the Theosophical method of the consciousness developing, quoting "superb," in hers opinion, essay on ''The Oversoul'' by [[Ralph Emerson]], "I, the imperfect, adore my own perfect."{{sfnm|Emerson|1851|1p=135|Blavatsky|1879|2p=4|Шабанова|2016|3p=26}} She refers [[Plotinus]], who counted that the secret [[gnosis]], or the knowledge of Theosophy, has "three degrees—opinion, science, and illumination." Blavatsky continues the cite: "The means or instrument of the first is sense, or perception; of the second, dialectics; of the third, intuition. To the last, reason is subordinate; it is ''absolute knowledge,'' founded on the identification of the mind with the object known."{{sfnm|Plotinus|1856|1pp=86–7|Blavatsky|1879|2p=4|Шабанова|2016|3p=26}} She then writes, "Theosophy is the exact science of psychology, so to say; it stands in relation to natural, uncultivated [[mediumship]], as the knowledge of a [[John Tyndall|Tyndall]] stands to that of a school-boy in physics."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=4|Шабанова|2016|2p=26}}{{refn|group=note|"To Blavatsky, Theosophy was empirically verifiable (through science, [[siddhi|psychic powers]], and history)."{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=221}}}}

== Criticism of Theosophy ==
Both the explicit ideological opponents of Blavatsky's doctrine and the Western esotericism scholars who claim for objectivity are equally interested in separating modern Theosophy from the classical one.{{refn|group=note|Professor [[Joscelyn Godwin]] in his 1994 work used the following terminology, "Theosophy and Theosophists, with a capital T, refer to Blavatsky's society and its members, theosophy and theosophers refer to the tradition of religious illumination exemplified by Jacob Boehme and his followers."{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}} Also Santucci stated, "'Theosophy,' with a capital 'T,' represents the modern Theosophy of the Theosophical societies, while theosophy (with a lower-case 't') represents other and usually earlier forms of theosophy."{{sfn|Santucci|2012|p=244}}}} For example, according to [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], "contemporary 'theosophical' movements" corrupted the beautiful word 'Theosophy' and "have made us forget" the existence of a genuine "Christian theosophy". He believed that modern Theosophy does not represent a synthesis of religion, philosophy and science, as its adherents say, but there is a "mixture" of them, in which there is no real religion, no real philosophy, no real science.{{sfn|Berdyaev|1972|pp=270, 299}}{{refn|group=note|Nevertheless, professor [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] noted that, in contrast to the [[Boehmian theosophy]], Blavatskian Theosophy, "adapting contemporary scientific ideas," raised the concept of "spiritual evolution through countless worlds and eras."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=211}}}}

In professor [[Antoine Faivre]]'s opinion, that what Blavatsky called "Theosophy" was in fact only her own doctrine.{{sfn|Faivre|2000|p=28}} [[René Guénon]] believed that "[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophism]]" is a "confused mixture" of [[Neoplatonism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Jewish Kabbalah]], [[Hermeticism]], and [[occultism]].{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=91}} A religious philosopher [[Sergius Bulgakov]] stated that [Blavatskian] Theosophy, trying to replace religion with itself, turns into a "vulgar pseudoscientific mythology."{{sfn|Bulgakov|2012|p=37}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4953">The '''Yan Tatsine''' were a follower group of the controversial Nigerian Muslim leader [[Maitatsine]], that first appeared around the early 1970s. They consisted largely of a following of youths, unemployed migrants, and those who felt that mainstream Muslim teachers were not doing enough for their communities.

==Activity==

===1980 events===
{{main article|Kano 1980 riot}}
As Maitatsine's support increased in the 1970s, so did the number of confrontations between Yan Tatsine and the police. By December 1980, continued Yan Tatsine attacks on other religious figures and police forced the [[Army of Nigeria|Nigerian army]] to become involved. Subsequent armed clashes led to the deaths of around 5,000 people, including Maitatsine himself.&lt;ref name="pham"/&gt;  Maitatsine died shortly after sustaining injuries in the clashes either from his wounds or from a heart attack.&lt;ref name="hiskett"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Maitatsine Riots in Kano, 1980: An Assessment | journal = Journal of Religion in Africa | date = October 1987 | first = Mervyn | last = Hiskett | volume = 17 | pages = 209–23| id = | jstor = 1580875 | doi=10.1163/157006687x00145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After Maitatsine's death ===
Despite Mohammed Marwa's death, Yan Tatsine riots continued into the early 1980s. In October 1982 riots erupted in [[Bulumkuttu]], near [[Maidaguri]] and in [[Kaduna]], to where many Yan Tatsine adherents had moved after 1980.  Over 3,000 people died.  Some survivors of these altercations moved to [[Yola, Nigeria|Yola]], and in early 1984 more violent uprisings occurred in that city.  In this round of rioting, [[Musa Makaniki]], a close disciple of Maitatsine, emerged as a leader and Marwa's successor.&lt;ref name="pham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hiskett"/&gt;  Ultimately more than 1,000 people died in Yola and roughly half of the city's 60,000 inhabitants were left homeless.  Makaniki fled to his hometown of [[Gombe, Nigeria|Gombe]], where more Yan Tatsine riots occurred in April 1985. A final riot occurred in Funtua, Kaduna state in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.openedition.org/ifra/788?lang=en#cite&lt;/ref&gt; After the deaths of several hundred people Makaniki retreated to Cameroon, where he remained until 2004 when he was arrested in Nigeria,&lt;ref&gt;KAYODE FASUA (Mar 3, 2013).

== Ideology==
The group were [[Quranist]]s, seemingly rejecting the [[hadith]] and the [[sunnah]] and regarded the reading of any other book but the Koran as [[paganism]].  They spoke against the use of radios, watches, bicycles, cars and the possession of more money than necessary.&lt;ref name="pham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kastfelt1989"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Rumours of Maitatsine: A Note on Political Culture in Northern Nigeria | journal = African Affairs | year = 1989 | first = Niels | last = Kastfelt | volume = 88 | issue = 350 | pages = 83–90| id = | url = http://afraf.oxfordjournals.org/content/88/350/83.extract | accessdate = 2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Aliyu U.
