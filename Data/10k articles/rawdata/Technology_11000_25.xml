'''Advanced Wireless Services''' ('''AWS''') is a wireless [[telecommunications]] spectrum band used for mobile voice and data services, video, and messaging.  AWS is used in the [[United States]], [[Argentina]], [[Canada]], [[Colombia]], [[Mexico]], [[Chile]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]].  It replaces some of the spectrum formerly allocated to [[Multipoint Multichannel Distribution Service]] (MMDS), sometimes referred to as [[Wireless Cable]], that existed from 2150 to 2162&amp;nbsp;MHz.

The AWS band uses [[microwave]] [[Electromagnetic spectrum|frequencies]] in several segments: from 1695 to 2200&amp;nbsp;MHz. The service is intended to be used by mobile devices such as wireless phones for mobile voice, data, and messaging services.  Most manufacturers of smartphone mobile handsets provide versions of their phones that include radios that can communicate using the AWS spectrum.  Though initially limited, device support for AWS has steadily improved the longer the band has been in general use, with most high-end and many mid-range handsets supporting it over [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]], [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]], or both.

== Changes ==
[[File:Advanced Wireless Services.svg|frameless|right|upright=5|The Frequency band covered by the Advanced Wireless Services bands.]]

The AWS band defined in 2002 (AWS-1), used [[microwave]] [[Electromagnetic spectrum|frequencies]] in two segments, from 1710 to 1755&amp;nbsp;MHz for uplink, and from 2110 to 2155&amp;nbsp;MHz for downlink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfsworld.com/stayconnected/index.php?p=657&amp;l=1&amp;listName=stayconnected_en_articles&amp;indexVal=651 |title=RFS - Stay Connected Article |website=Rfsworld.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The service is intended to be used by mobile devices such as wireless phones for mobile voice, data, and messaging services.  Most manufacturers of smartphone mobile handsets provide versions of their phones that include radios that can communicate using the AWS spectrum.  Since for downlink AWS uses a subset of [[UMTS frequency bands|UMTS frequency band I (2100 MHz)]] some UMTS2100 capable handsets do detect AWS networks but cannot register on them due to the difference in uplink frequencies (1710–1755&amp;nbsp;MHz for AWS vs. 1920–1980&amp;nbsp;MHz for UMTS2100).

Though initially limited, device support for AWS has steadily improved the longer the frequency has been in general use, with most high-end and many mid-range handsets supporting it over [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]], [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]], or both.  In Canada, almost all available LTE handsets support AWS as it was the first frequency over which LTE was offered there, and was still the most commonly supported frequency for LTE in Canada as of 2014-08-21.

In 2012 the [FCC] released rules for the 'H' block (AWS-2), covering the frequencies 1915-1920&amp;nbsp;MHz and 1995-2000&amp;nbsp;MHz.

In 2013 they regulated the AWS-3 Block, covering bands 1695-1710&amp;nbsp;MHz, 1755-1780&amp;nbsp;MHz and 2155-2180&amp;nbsp;MHz.

In 2012 there was a proposal regarding the AWS-4 Block, which regulated use of 2000-2020&amp;nbsp;MHz and 2180-2200&amp;nbsp;MHz. These were initially proposed for use with the [[Global_Mobile_Satellite_System|Mobile Satellite System]] (MSS), but later more uses were introduced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Advanced Wireless Services page at FCC|title=Advanced Wireless Service (AWS)|url=https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/advanced-wireless-services-aws|website=About he Federal Communications Commission|publisher=FCC.gov|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canada ==
In Canada, Industry Canada held the auction for AWS spectrum in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/h_sf08891.html |title=Auction of Spectrum Licences for Advanced Wireless Services (AWS-1) and Other Spectrum in the 2 GHz Range - Spectrum Management and Telecommunications |website=Ic.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freedom Mobile]] (formerly Wind Mobile) had licensed AWS spectrum in every province, and began offering voice and data services on December 16, 2009. Its Saskatchewan and Manitoba spectrum was later sold off to Sasktel and MTS, respectively. Freedom only operates in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario, although they have roaming agreements with Rogers, Telus and Bell at extra cost.

[[Mobilicity]] also used the AWS spectrum and began offering services in May 2010, operating in similar areas as Wind but with a smaller network footprint. Its AWS network was combined with Rogers when the latter company acquired Mobilicity in 2015.&lt;ref name=fp-mobisale&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pellegrini|first1=Christina|title=Rogers Communications Inc gets green lights on Mobilicity deal from courts|url=http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/rogers-communications-inc-gets-green-lights-on-mobilicity-deal|accessdate=25 June 2015|work=Financial Post|date=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quebecor]] licensed AWS spectrum throughout the province of Quebec and began offering service with its [[Vidéotron Mobile]] brand on September 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2010/07/c7478.html |title=Media Advisory - Quebecor Media and Videotron invite you to the dawn of a new era |website=Newswire.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shaw Communications]] licensed AWS spectrum in western Canada and northern Ontario, began to build some infrastructure for providing wireless phone service, but subsequently decided to cancel further development and did not launch this service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/companies/article/974406--shaw-rethinking-wireless-strategy |title=Shaw rethinking wireless strategy &amp;#124; Toronto Star |website=Thestar.com |date=2011-04-13 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licenses were eventually sold to Rogers, with some transferred to Wind.&lt;ref name=fp-mobisale /&gt; Shaw re-entered the mobile services market when it acquired Wind Mobile in 2016.&lt;ref name="gandm-shawcomplete"&gt;{{cite news|title=Shaw enters wireless market with closing of Wind Mobile deal|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/shaw-announces-closing-of-wind-mobile-deal/article28983065/|accessdate=2 March 2016|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halifax-based [[EastLink (company)|EastLink]] obtained licenses in eastern Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://ogov.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/July2008/21/c6290.html |title=EastLink Planning To Go Wireless After Success In Spectrum Auction |website=Ogov.newswire.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a small amount of spectrum bought in Ontario and Alberta, and is currently building up infrastructure to launch mobile phone and data services in Nova Scotia and PEI in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastlink.ca/About/PressReleases.aspx?NewsId%3D295 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107120117/http://www.eastlink.ca/About/PressReleases.aspx?NewsId=295 |archivedate=2012-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2011/07/23/eastlink-launching-a-world-class-wireless-network-in-2012/ |title=EastLink launching a "world-class wireless network" in 2012 |website=MobileSyrup.com |date=2011-07-23 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Service has since launched and is available in numerous markets around Atlantic Canada with roaming through Rogers and Bell.

[[Rogers Wireless]], [[Bell Mobility]], [[Telus Mobility]], [[SaskTel]], and [[Manitoba Telecom Services]] (MTS) all received licenses for AWS spectrum, which they are now using for their [[Long-Term Evolution|LTE]] networks. Freedom Mobile has subsequently refarmed some spectrum in their UMTS network and deployed LTE on bands 4, and 66.

== United States ==
In the United States, the service is administered by the [[Federal Communications Commission]].  The licenses were broken up into 6 blocks (A-F). Block A consisted of 734 Cellular Market Areas (CMA).  Blocks B and C were each divided into 176 Economic Areas (EA), sometimes referred to as BEA by the FCC.  Blocks D, E, and F were each broken up into 12 Regional Economic Area Groupings (REAG), sometimes referred to as REA by the FCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wireless.fcc.gov/services/aws/data/awsbandplan.pdf |format=PDF |title=Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) Band Plan |website=Wireless.fcc.gov |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phonescoop.com/articles/article.php?a=99&amp;p=1494 |title=A Visual Guide to AWS : Blocks |publisher=Phone Scoop |date= |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bidding for this new spectrum started on August 9, 2006 and the majority of the frequency blocks were sold to [[T-Mobile USA]] to deploy their 3G wireless network in the United States.  This move effectively killed the former MMDS and/or Wireless Cable service in the United States.

In [[telecommunication]], the term '''alarm sensor''' has the following meanings: 

'''1.'''  In [[Telecommunication|communications]] systems, a device that can sense an abnormal condition within the [[system]] and provide a [[message|signal]] indicating the presence or nature of the abnormality to either a local or remote [[alarm indicator]], and (b) may detect events ranging from a simple contact opening or closure to a [[time]]-phased automatic shutdown and restart cycle.  

'''2.'''  In a physical [[security]] system, an approved device used to indicate a change in the physical environment of a [[building|facility]] or a part thereof.  

'''3.''' In electronic security systems, a physical device or change/presence of any electronic signal/logic which causes trigger to electronic circuit to perform application specific operation. In electronic alarm systems the use of this trigger event done by such devices is to turn on the alarm or siren producing sound and/or perform a security calling through telephone lines.

''Note:''  Alarm sensors may also be redundant or chained, such as when one alarm [[sensor]] is used to protect the housing, cabling, or [[power (physics)|power]] protected by another alarm sensor.

'''Avid Technology''' (often known as '''Avid''', stylized as ▲▼❚▶) is an American technology and multimedia company founded in August 1987 by Bill Warner, based in [[Burlington, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Avid Corporate Background"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avid.com/pressroom/corp_bg.html |title=Avid Corporate Background |publisher=Avid Technology |accessdate=2009-01-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230054204/http://www.avid.com/pressroom/corp_bg.html |archivedate=30 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="About Avid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avid.com/company/ |title=About Avid |publisher=Avid Technology |accessdate=2009-01-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116131859/http://www.avid.com/company/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It specializes in [[Digital audio|audio]] and [[video]]; specifically, digital [[Non-linear editing system|non-linear editing]] (NLE) systems, management and distribution services.

Avid products are now used in the television and video industry to create [[television shows]], [[Film|feature films]], and [[commercials]]. [[Media Composer]], a professional software-based non-linear editing system, is Avid's [[flagship product]].

==History==
Avid was founded by a marketing manager from [[Apollo Computer]], Bill Warner, a prototype of their first digital nonlinear editing system (the Avid/1) was shown in a private suite at the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] (NAB) convention in April 1988. The Avid/1 was based on an [[Apple Macintosh II]] computer, with special hardware and software of Avid's own design installed.

At the NAB show in April 1989, the Avid/1 was publicly introduced. It was "the biggest shake-up in editing since [[Georges Méliès|Melies]] played around with time and sequences in the early 1900s".&lt;ref&gt;Russell Evans, Practical DV Filmmaking, Focal Press, 2005 {{ISBN|0-240-80738-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-240-80738-6}} page 13&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1990s, Avid products began to replace such tools as the [[Moviola]], Steenbeck, and KEM flatbed editors, allowing [[Film editor|editors]] to handle their [[film]] creations with greater ease. The first feature film edited using the Avid was ''Let's Kill All the Lawyers'' in 1992, directed by Ron Senkowski. The film was edited at 30fps NTSC rate, then used Avid MediaMatch to generate a negative cutlist from the EDL.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0784374/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kennedy|first1=Ashley|title=Fun Facts and Dates in Digital Editing ‘Firsts’|url=https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/fun-facts-and-dates-in-digital-editing-firsts/|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first feature film edited natively at 24fps with what was to become the Avid Film Composer was ''[[Emerson Park]]''. The first studio film to be edited at 24fps was ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]'', directed by Martha Coolidge. By 1994 only three feature films used the new digital editing system.  By 1995 dozens had switched to Avid, and it signaled the beginning of the end of cutting celluloid.  In 1996 [[Walter Murch]] accepted the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for editing ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' (which also won best picture), which he cut on the Avid. This was the first Editing Oscar awarded to a digitally edited film (although the final print was still created with traditional [[negative cutting]]).&lt;ref&gt;Scott Kirsner, Inventing the Movies: Hollywood's Epic Battle Between Innovation and the Status Quo, from Thomas Edison to Steve Jobs  (2008) Publisher Scott Kirsner, {{ISBN|1-4382-0999-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4382-0999-9}} page 84-85
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 Avid introduced [[Open Media Framework Interchange|Open Media Framework]] (OMF) as an open standard file format for sharing media and related metadata.  In recent years the company has extended its business expertise through several acquisitions and internal investments towards the full palette of multimedia generation products including those to store and manage media files.  In 2006 Avid launched new products such as Avid Interplay and Unity Isis.  Avid used to be considered just a "[[video editing]]" company, but now has consolidated a well-rounded multimedia generation technology company.

In the past, Avid has released home versions of their professional line of editors, such as [[Xpress DV]] and lower cost professional versions such as [[Xpress Pro]]. Additionally, [[Avid Free DV]] was available as a free download, providing an introduction to the [[Media Composer]] interface, but in a limited version. All of these have now been discontinued as the core Media Composer product has been lowered in price and is now heavily discounted for academic/student use.

On March 29, 1999, Avid Technology, Inc. adjusted the amount originally allocated to IPR&amp;D and restated its third quarter 1998 consolidated financial statements accordingly, considering the SEC's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Avid+Technology+Announces+Revaluation+of+Acquisition+Charges%3B+First...-a054243535| title=Avid Technology Announces Revaluation of Acquisition Charges}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===

In 1993, the National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences awarded Avid Technology and all of the company's initial employees with a technical Emmy award for Outstanding Engineering Development for the Avid Media Composer video editing system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uml.edu/it/newsletter/content/print_1_210811_210811.html Steve Hall Charged With Ensuring Reliable, Consistent IT Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131063836/http://www.uml.edu/it/newsletter/content/print_1_210811_210811.html |date=2013-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/curiosity/topics/william-warner.htm Curiosity Expert: William J.

A '''bicycle pump''' is a type of [[positive-displacement pump|positive-displacement]] [[air pump]] specifically designed for inflating [[bicycle tire]]s.  It has a connection or adapter for use with one or both of the two most common types of [[valve]]s used on bicycles, [[Schrader valve|Schrader]] or [[Presta valve|Presta]].  A third type of valve called the [[Dunlop valve|Dunlop]] (or Woods) valve exists, but tubes with these valves can be filled using a Presta pump.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_w.html#woods Sheldon Brown's Bicycle Glossary W&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several basic types are available:
* Floor pumps
* Frame-mounted
* Compact or mini
* Foot-operated
* Double-action
* Blast or tubeless

In its most basic form, a bicycle pump functions via a hand-operated [[piston]]. During up-stroke, this piston draws air through a one-way [[valve]] into the pump from outside. During down-stroke, the piston then displaces air from the pump into the bicycle tire. Most floor pumps, also commonly called track pumps, have a built-in pressure gauge to indicate tire pressure.

Electrically-operated pumps intended to inflate car tires (as available in most [[Filling station|service station]]s) can in principle be used to inflate a bicycle tire if the right type of connection is available. Some such pumps are designed to cut off before a suitable pressure (much higher for a bicycle than a car tire), and will much under inflate the tire. Others may not cut off, but deliver a high rate of flow to fill the larger car tire, with a risk of over inflating and bursting a bicycle tire unless it is stopped with split-second timing.

Inflating [[Bicycle_tire#Tubeless|tubeless]] tires requires an initial surge of air to seat the bead, and specialized pumps are available specifically for this task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
It is not known when the first bicycle pump was invented, but it is believed to have been in or around 1887, which is when the first inflatable tire or pneumatic tire was produced by [[John Boyd Dunlop]] of Scotland. The first bicycle pump consisted of a metal cylinder that had a metal rod running down the middle of it. This would have forced the air out of the cylinder and then sucked in new air when the metal rod was pulled up again. Many modern pumps use a very similar method, while some, such as the electric pumps, use an automated pumping mechanism.

==How they work==
The bicycle pump compresses air. When the cylinder is compressed, air is pushed down the tube of the pump and then into the tire via the valve, which is forced open by the pressure of the air. When the handle is pulled up again, the valve shuts off automatically so that the air cannot escape from the tire, and new air is forced back into the cylinder so the process can be repeated. Some pumps have a gauge that shows the pressure of air that is forced into the tire. Once the tire is at the correct pressure, the pump valve can be removed from the tire, and the cap can be replaced on the tire valve.

There are two main types of tire [[valves]] to which the bicycle tire pump attaches. These are the [[Presta valve]] and the [[Schrader valve]]. Some pumps fit both types of valves, whereas others do not, but adapters are available that enable the pump to fit any type of valve. "All valves adjustable connecting systems," also known as AVACS, enable the pump to fit any type of valve found on a bicycle, and it also has the capacity to fit onto other universal inflatable products, such as balls, paddling pools, and rubber rings. The AVACS feature is commonly available on pump models and can also be bought as a separate valve attachment.
It also works by repeatedly pulling and pushing activities of the Piston.

==Types==
There are three main types of bicycle pumps

*Stand pump
*Hand pump
*Foot pump

=== Stand pump ===
Also known as a floor or track pump. To operate, the user rests the base of the pump on the floor, resting feet at the base, and pulls and pushes full strokes with handles. An additional tube must connect the pump to the fill valve, which may create dead volume.

=== Hand pump ===
There are two basic types: tubed and integral. The tubed type requires a separate tube to connect the pump to the valve. These have the advantage that they are cheap, but are inefficient compared to other pumps. They also have a lot of joints from which air can escape.

Integral pumps have a hole in the side with a rubber washer that fits round the valve. This is frequently compressed on to the valve by an extra lever. Because it is well sealed, rigid and has little dead volume, this type of pump is very efficient. An 8" integral will typically pump faster than an 18" tubed. These type of pumps will run the risk of shredding the tube valves, especially on those with presta valves.

A simple pump has a cupped fiber or plastic piston. On the forward stroke the air pushes the sides of the cup against the cylinder, so forming a seal; it provides its own valve. Then this piston can push the air out of the hole at the far end.

Some of the most efficient pumps are double action pumps. By sealing the piston in the cylinder at both ends they can force air into the tire on both strokes.

Pumps can be fitted to a bracket on the bike frame, either a clamp on, screw on, or a [[braze-on]] peg, or they can be carried in a pannier or other bag on the bike, or they can be carried by the rider in a backpack, pocket, etc.

==== Mini pump ====
Mini pumps (or compact pumps) are usually hand pumps that have been made very small and light, so that they can readily be carried on a bicycle for emergency use; they can fit in pockets, saddle bags, or even include a water bottle bracket. Because of their small size, the volume of air that these pumps can provide is somewhat limited compared to a floor pump, so quite a lot of pumping may be needed.

=== Foot pump ===
These pumps are often not specifically designed for bicycle use. They do not generate very high pressures so do not work well for narrow road-bike tires, but are fine for large low-pressure tires as found on mountain bikes.

Because they are designed for cars they fit Schrader valves. If the bicycle has Presta valves a small brass reducer is required in order to use the pump.

=== CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inflators ===
Gas-filled cylinders for bicycles have an unclear history but appear to have appeared between the two World Wars. One story says they were made "by a rider after watching a café proprietor charge up the glass of beer he had ordered from a bottle of carbon dioxide."&lt;ref&gt;The Bicycle, UK, 30 September 1942, p6&lt;/ref&gt;

The pumps generally used liquefied gas that could not be replaced at home. A later version, which had more success, used a cartridge sold originally for drinks siphons. A lever broke the cartridge and enough gas escaped to inflate a tire.

Modern gas pumps are often used by mountain bike or road bike racers who need to save weight, and to save time if they puncture during a race. They can be a one-time pump or a pump that can be fitted with a replacement cartridge. Most pumps use carbon dioxide and standard-threaded 16g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; canisters.  Carbon dioxide leaks out of a rubber inner tube more rapidly than air - despite its [https://biketoolsreview.com/best-so2-inflators-2017-2018/ larger size], the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule is slightly soluble in rubber and a tire may go flat within a few days.

=== Electric pump ===
Twelve-volt air compressors made for [[automobile tire]]s are also compatible with bicycle tires.  A portable jump-starter for automobiles can sometimes be used to power these types of pumps.  Even non-standard do-it-yourself (DIY) 12-volt electric systems that are primarily for [[bicycle lighting]] are sometimes used to power these pumps when [[cigar lighter receptacle]]s are installed.  A main advantage to electric pumps is that recent ones take up less space than hand or foot pumps, which makes them suitable for well-equipped bicycles with DIY 12-volt electric systems to use when basket space is of the essence.

==Tire pressure==
The pressure rating of tires is usually stamped somewhere on the sidewall. This may be in psi ([[pounds per square inch]]) or [[Bar (unit)|bar]]. The pressure rating could be indicated as "Maximum Pressure," or "Inflate to . . . " and will usually give a range (for example, 90-120 psi, or 35-60 psi). Inflating to the lower number in the pressure range will increase traction and make the ride more comfortable. Inflating to the higher number will make the ride more efficient and will decrease the chances of getting a flat tire but a firmer ride must be expected.

===Pressure output===
The maximum pressure, or how much air the pump can force into a tire, is an important consideration. The pump needs to match or exceed the stated air pressure the tires can handle. If the maximum air pressure is too low, it will not be able to adequately inflate the tires, no matter how hard it is used.

The '''BiteStrip''' is a disposable self-use home test for Sleep [[Bruxism]]. Its indications correlate well with comparable indications from formal [[sleep]] lab studies.

The device is a miniature but complete sleep EMG ([[electromyography]]) monitor, including two pre-gelled EMG electrodes, an amplifier, a micro-processor-based real time data acquisition and analysis hardware and software, and a permanent chemical display unit. The entire system is integrated on a small piece of lightweight plastic film attached to the user’s cheek. By analyzing the [[jaw]] muscles’ EMG waveforms in real time during the night and presenting the result on the built-in display, the device doesn’t need a large data memory, and the downloading and analysis phases, common to all current sleep recorders, are eliminated. Test results indicate the number of bruxing events detected per hour of sleep (bruxing index or BI). This indication appears as permanent numbers encoded onto the electro-chemical display for easy reading. The device itself can serve as the medical record of the test. Self-test letters indicate technical and clinical validity of the study{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}.

Sleep [[Bruxism]] (SB) is a serious medical disorder, characterized by involuntary grinding and clenching of [[teeth]] during sleep. It is often accompanied by unpleasant grinding sounds heard by the bed-partner or roommate. Symptoms include wearing of teeth, [[temporomandibular]] joint (TMJ) dysfunction or pain, chewing difficulties, headaches and daytime sleepiness. The prevalence of SB is estimated at 14%-20% in children and 8% in adults{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}. Diagnosis of SB is usually based on clinical examination and patient history. However, none of the signs and symptoms may be considered conclusive. Another alternative has been to send the patient to a sleep lab for an overnight test.

The '''Boynton Bicycle Railroad''' was a [[monorail]] in [[Brooklyn]] on [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. It ran on a single load-bearing rail at ground level, but with a wooden overhead stabilising rail engaged by a pair of horizontally opposed wheels. The railway operated for only two years, but the design was adopted elsewhere.

== History ==

The concept was invented by [[E. Moody Boynton]], who hoped that this would eventually replace the conventional rail road, because it was cheaper to build and could be used for a double track on the space available for a conventional single track right of way.&lt;ref name="ARTT's Archives"&gt;[http://www.arrts-arrchives.com/NYBB.html Typewriter manuscript by W.W. (Bill) Fausser] reproduced in ARTT's Archives by Arthur John Huneke.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Scientific American]]'' of 28 March 1891, the steam locomotive and cars were in regular and continuous operation for passenger service during several weeks in the summer of 1890. The service was provided between the [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend]] and [[Coney Island]] areas of [[Brooklyn]], on an abandoned section of an old standard gauge track of the [[Sea Beach and Brighton Railroad]]. The first locomotive weighed nine tons, and had two 10 by 12 inch cylinders, the piston rods of both being connected with cranks on each side the single 6 foot driving wheel, and the front of the locomotive being also supported by two 38 inch pony wheels, one behind the other. These wheels had double flanges, to contact with either side of the track rail, as also had similarly arranged pairs of 38 inch wheels arranged under and housed in the floors near each end of the passenger cars.”&lt;ref name="SciAm"&gt;[http://illianaroad.com/railroading/the-remarkable-boynton-unicycle-railroad/ Scientific American, 28 March 1891.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A heavier locomotive was especially designed for this method of traction, and built for use on a street railway. It weighed 16 tons and had a pair of 5 foot drivers. The crank was only seven inches in length, and the engine was designed to readily make 600 revolutions a minute, and maintain a speed of 100 miles an hour with a full train of passenger cars.&lt;ref name="SciAm"/&gt;

In a true line with, and fifteen feet directly above, the face of the track rail was the lower face of a guide rail, supported from posts arranged along the side of the track, and on the sides of this guide rail run pairs of rubber-faced trolley wheels attached to the top of the locomotive and the cars. The guide rail was a simple stringer of yellow pine, 4¼ by 8 inches in section, and the standards on which the wheels are journaled were placed far enough apart to allow a space of 6 inches between the continuous faces of each pair of wheels, thus affording 1¾ inches for lateral play, or sidewise movement toward or from the guard rail, it being designed that the guide rail shall be arranged in the exact line of the true center of gravity of the cars and locomotive. The standards were bolted to six-inch wide strap iron attached to and extending across the top of the car.&lt;ref name="SciAm"/&gt;

The switching arrangement was remarkably simple. In addition to an ordinary track switch, in which, however, the switch bar is made to throw only one rail, a connection was made by means of a vertical rod and upper switch bar with a shifting section of the guide rail, whereby, on the moving of the track rail and the setting of the signal, the guide rail was simultaneously moved, the adjustment being effected and both being locked in position according to the methods usual in ordinary railway practice.&lt;ref name="SciAm"/&gt;

The passenger cars were each two stories in height, each story being divided lengthwise into nine separate compartments, each of which seated comfortably four passengers, thus providing seats for 72 passengers in each car. Each compartment had its own sliding door, and all the doors on the same floor of the car were connected by rods at the top and bottom with a lever in convenient reach of the brakeman, by whom the doors are all opened and closed simultaneously. The compartments were each four feet wide and five feet long, the seats facing each other. Only one rail of the old single track was used, as only one guide rail had been erected, except at the ends of the route, for switching purposes, but the width of the cars and motor was such that it only required the erection of another guide rail, for the utilizing of the other track rail, to form a regular double-track road of the Boynton pattern.&lt;ref name="SciAm"/&gt;

The section of railroad on which this system has been operated was only 2 miles long, in which distance the curves were considerable, but, although they were mostly in one direction, the indications of wear upon the traction wheels, and upon the guide rail and trolley wheels, were hardly perceptible. During a portion of the season, when the summer travel to Coney Island was at its height, trains were run on regular schedule time, 50 three-car-trains daily each way, carrying from one to three hundred passengers per trip.&lt;ref name="SciAm"/&gt;

==Locomotive designs==
At least four different locomotive designs for the Boynton Bicycle Railroad were produced but it is unclear how many were actually built.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arrts-arrchives.com/NYBB.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[satellite communications]], '''carrier-to-noise-density ratio''' ('''''C/N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''''') is the [[ratio]] of the [[carrier signal|carrier]] [[power (physics)|power]] ''C'' to the [[noise power density]] ''N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', expressed in [[dB-Hz]].
When considering only the [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] as a source of noise, it is called '''carrier-to-receiver-noise-density ratio'''.

It determines whether a receiver can lock on to the carrier and if the information [[encoded]] in the [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] can be retrieved, given the amount of noise present in the received signal. The carrier-to-receiver noise density ratio is usually expressed in [[decibel|dBHz]].

The noise power density, ''N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''=''kT'', is the receiver noise power per [[hertz]], which can be written in terms of the [[Boltzmann constant]] ''k'' (in joules per [[kelvin]]) and the [[noise temperature]] ''T''  (in kelvins).

[[File:Fox Brothers, Coldharbour Mill, Uffculme - geograph.org.uk - 97156.jpg|thumb|Coldharbour Mill in 2009, viewed from the middle [[leat]]. The construction of the main building started in 1799.]]

'''Coldharbour Mill''', near the village of [[Uffculme]] in [[Devon]], England, is one of the oldest woollen [[textile mills]] in the world, having been in continuous production since 1797. The mill was one of a number owned by [[Fox Brothers]], and is designated by [[English Heritage]] as a Grade II* [[listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1106486|desc=COLDHARBOUR MILL |accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

Coldharbour Mill can be found just off junction 27 of the M5 motorway near the village of [[Uffculme]], and near to the border with [[Somerset]]. The headquarters for the mill was at Tonedale in [[Wellington, Somerset|Wellington]]. The water provided by the nearby [[River Culm]] was a prime factor in Thomas Fox's decision to purchase the existing [[grist mill]]. In 1797 he wrote to his brother "I have purchased the premises at Uffculme for eleven hundred guineas, which I do not think dear as they include about fifteen acres of very fine meadow land. The buildings are but middling, but the stream good."&lt;ref name=QH&gt;Fox, Hubert ''Quaker Homespun, The Life of Thomas Fox of Wellington, Serge Maker and Banker 1747-1821'' privately printed{{reliable source|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The roads in the area at the time were very poor, and finished cloth had to be carried by pack horses to the nearby ports of [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]] and [[Exeter]], or by carrier's cart to Bridgwater, Bristol and London (a twelve-day journey).

==History==

It appears that there has been a mill of some description near the Coldharbour site since Saxon times. The Domesday Book recording two mills in the Uffculme area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domesdaymap.co.uk/place/ST0612/uffculme/|title=Uffculme - Domesday Book|first=Anna|last=Powell-Smith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its peak the company employed approximately 5,000 people and owned and operated nine mills and factories in Somerset, Devon, and [[Oxfordshire]]. One of the most notable satellite mills was that of [[Bliss Tweed Mill|William Bliss &amp; Sons]], built in 1872 after a disastrous fire in the original mill. Located in [[Chipping Norton]], the William Bliss site was one of the grandest mills in England, complete with reading room, chapel and workers cottages. Fox Brothers bought it in 1920. [[File:Bliss Mill from Worcester Road - geograph.org.uk - 329977.jpg|thumb|[[Bliss Tweed Mill|Bliss Mill]], [[Chipping Norton]]]]
The main Tonedale site in Wellington was the largest integrated mill site in the South West of England, covering 10 acres of land and forming the hub of the Fox Brothers woollen manufacturing 'empire'. It is believed to have been the only 'Twin Vertical Woollen Factory' in the world - that is, making both [[worsted]] and [[woolen|woollen]] products, and controlling the entire process from fleece to finished cloth in-house.
[[File:Wellington, Tonedale Mills - geograph.org.uk - 56153.jpg|thumb|[[Tonedale Mills]], [[Wellington, Somerset|Wellington]]]]

==The founders==

The ancestors of the mill owners, the Fox family (no relation to [[George Fox]], founder of the [[Religious Society of Friends]], or Quakers) and the Were family, were early Quaker converts. During George Fox's first visit to Devonshire in 1655, he went to the house of Nicholas Tripe and his wife, who became 'convinced'.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Hubert ''The Beginning of Quakerism in Devon and Cornwall'' Privately printed 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter, Anstice, married George Croker of Plymouth, and they were much persecuted for their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Besse, Joseph ''A Brief Account of many of the prosecutions of the people call'd Quakers'' Sowle, London 1736&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter Tabitha married [[Francis Fox of St. Germans]], Cornwall, a [[Serge (fabric)|serge]] maker. The family remained in Cornwall, becoming merchants and shipping agents, and in 1745 the grandson of Francis and Tabitha, Edward Fox of Eggeshall near Wadebridge, married Anne Were, the daughter of a Wellington sergemaker, Thomas Were. (In 1749, Edward's cousin, George Croker Fox, married Mary Were, the sister of Anne). Thomas Were was a very successful manufacturer, and had inherited the WRE trademark, which certified the quality of his cloth.&lt;ref name=WMW&gt;Fox, Joseph Hoyland ''The Woollen Manufacture at Wellington, Somerset. Compiled from the Records of the Old Family Business'' Arthur Humphreys, London 1914&lt;/ref&gt; His great-great grandfather John Were of Pinksmoor was credited with owning a [[fulling mill]]. During one of the visits of Edward to his father-in-law, it was suggested that one of Edward and Anne's sons should join the Wellington woollen manufacturing business.&lt;ref name=QH /&gt; After four years study overseas, Edward's son Thomas Fox moved to Wellington, and became a partner of Were and Company in 1772, aged 25.  Thomas and his wife Sarah Smith, built in 1801, then lived in, [[Tone Dale House]], Wellington - the house is still lived in by a Fox, five generations later, by Ben and Victoria Fox. In 1826, when his sons were partners (the Weres having relinquished their shares), the business was renamed Fox Brothers.

The family were prominent in local affairs, and subscribed £1,044 5s 6d in shares in the [[Grand Western Canal]] between 1809 and 1813,&lt;ref name=WMW /&gt; Thomas having considered the original proposal of 1792 with considerable reticence: "People hereaway seem now as much too eager to engage in Canals as they have been too backward for many years. The almost incredible sum of £900,000 was lately subscribed at Wells in about two hours for cutting one from Taunton to Bristol. Whilst this delyrium continues the writer is neither disposed to subscribe himself nor to recommend his friends doing it, as he doubts whilst such money pours in on them in such abundance it may be badly husbanded."&lt;ref name=QH /&gt;

===Banking===
In 1787, Were and Company ran short of ready cash, and decided to print their own bank notes - effectively "promises to pay". On 30 October, Thomas printed 500 notes of five guineas each. The notes were well received by local businesses. In 1797, an invasion scare resulted in a shortage of gold and cash, and Thomas Fox issued 3,000 five guinea notes, and seventy six £20 notes in order to enable his business to continue its expansion.&lt;ref name=QH /&gt;
The [[Fox, Fowler and Company]] bank eventually had over fifty branches in the West Country, and was authorised to issue its own [[bank notes]] until 1921, the year it was taken over by Lloyd's Bank - itself founded by a Quaker, [[Sampson Lloyd]]. One of the original £5 notes is on display at [[Tone Dale House]], the family home which Thomas Fox built, in 1801.  [[File:Uffculme, Coldharbour Mill - geograph.org.uk - 839621.jpg|thumb|A view looking along the upper leat.

==Textile products==

Exeter was the centre of the mediaeval woollen trade in England, with cloth being exported to the Continental markets of France, Holland and Germany. [[Kersey (cloth)|Kersey]], a sturdy cloth, was superseded by serge, so that by 1681 95% of the Exeter cloth export was serge.&lt;ref name=PEE&gt;Clark, E.A.G. ''The ports of the Exe estuary 1660-1860'' University of Exeter 1960&lt;/ref&gt; As already mentioned, the Were family were major suppliers of serge cloth to the Continent, especially Holland. Whilst using the ports of London and Bristol as well, Topsham was a major port for the Were export trade. We have a contemporary description of the Exeter trade in serge by [[Celia Fiennes]] (1662–1741): {{quote|There is an Increadible quantety of [serges] made and sold in the town. There market day is Fryday ... the Large Market house set on stone pillars, wch runs a great Length on wch they Lay their packs of serges. Just by it is another walke wth in pillars wch is for the yarne, the whole town and Country is Employ'd for at Least 20 mile round in spinning, weaveing, dressing and scouring, fulling and Drying of the serges.

[[File:Coldharbour Mill - geograph.org.uk - 1139116.jpg|thumb|In the distance is the engine house and boiler house. The photo dates from 1980.]]
However, the French Revolution and the invasion of Flanders in 1793 caused very serious difficulties for Exeter cloth merchants, and in 1794 the Weres were forced to cancel major worsted yarn orders.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to James Hopwood of St Austell dated 1 October 1796 (''175 Years'', pamphlet privately printed for Fox Bros., Wellington, 1947 p8).&lt;/ref&gt;
Napoleon's Italian campaigns of 1796-7 closed the Italian market for English cloth, and then Spain entered the war as an ally of France, leading to the confiscation of Exeter cloth. Only six vessels cleared from the Exe with cloth in 1797, and two in 1798; a far cry from the 1768 despatch of 330,414 pieces of cloth.&lt;ref name=PEE /&gt; Some Exeter merchants, such as [[Baring family|Barings]], moved to London - the Weres changed production to ''long [[ell]]s'', a fine white serge, for the [[East India Company]]. A letter from Thomas Fox to Green and Walford, factors, is to be found in the Fox Brothers Letter Book archive: {{quote|Wellington, 15th seventh month 1788
We have for a great number of years been engaged in a very considerable manufactory of various export articles, the principal of which is mixt serges for Holland, but finding of late a slackness in demand owing to the troubles in that country, and the introduction of cottons and other articles, we see it necessary to turn part of our attention to some other articles of constant demand and Long Ells appear to us the most eligible. We hope if a tryal appears to answer we may in time prove mutually useful correspondents.&lt;ref name=QH /&gt;}}
With the termination of the monopoly of the East India Company's charter in 1833 through the [[Government of India Act 1833]] (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4 c. 85), the trade in long ells to China declined, and Thomas Fox developed the production of [[flannel]], which was sold in the home market and to America. Following his Quaker beliefs, Thomas Fox refused to sell flannel to the East India Company when he heard it would be used in the manufacture of cartridges.
In 1881, as a result of losses in the [[First Boer War]], a Parliamentary Commission sought to equip the army with [[khaki]] uniform. Fox Brothers decided to bid for the contract, reasoning that the new contract for 5,000 [[puttee]]s would save lives, as well as create employment. Fox Brothers went on to be the major producer of puttees, manufacturing some 850 miles of the cloth in World War One.

In support of the flannel emphasis, in 1865 Coldharbour Mill moved over to producing worsted yarn rather than woollen yarn. This necessitated the need for more power to drive new combing machines. (Worsted yarn is made from sheep with long hair fleeces and the wool has to be combed to ensure that all the fibres are parallel.)

Coldharbour Mill classifies itself as "a working wool museum" and as such runs its museum machinery to demonstrate how woollen products were made. The demonstration products (including worsted yarn, tartan cloth,and rugs) are made available for sale. The mill has four registered tartans - Devon Original (1284), Devon Companion (1283), Somerset (831), and Blackdown Hills (6711).&lt;ref&gt;* http://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/tartanDetails.aspx?ref=920

==Architecture==

English Heritage wrote a Historic Buildings Report (B/065/2001) about the mill complex, and described the site as "probably one of the best-preserved textile mill complexes in the country. It retains the full range of buildings and power system features which characterised the development of the 19th century textile mill with much of the machinery that was used at the site in the 20th century."&lt;ref name=CBR&gt;Williams, Mike ''Coldharbour Mill Historic Buildings Report (B/065/2001)'' English Heritage 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Coldharbour Mill was primarily always used for the production of wool [[yarn]] for the [[weaving]] frames of the Wellington mill. The original grist mill was probably a three storey building, and the original sale notice of 1788 states "The Stream divides in two Parts, one at each End of the House, and they are in a Manner two separate Mills, under the same Roof".&lt;ref&gt;''Exeter Flying Post'' 4 December 1788&lt;/ref&gt; A legal dispute of 1834 &lt;ref&gt;Documents relating to 1834 arbitration, including Plaintiff's map, Devon Records Office, 74B/ME98&lt;/ref&gt; contains a detailed map of the water courses, which are in their existing positions, with a leat to the front and rear of the grist mill.

The foundations of the main mill were mentioned in a letter of 15 April 1799, stating that they were 50 feet from the grist mill - further away than the current building, but at a point where the wall is thicker today. The mill building of 39 feet wide by 123 feet long was very large for its time. Thomas Fox wrote to his machinery supplier describing how the new mill building was to operate: {{quote|Wellington 7th third month 1799
I find in my work here that a single carder supplies two billies and each billy three jennies. I wish therefore to make my building three stories high and on each floor to place one scribbler, two single or double carders, four billies, two on each side the creeper, and twelve jennies, and to place the water wheel nearly at one end so as at any time to add to it another building of like dimensions.&lt;ref name=QH /&gt;}}
An inventory of 1802 suggests that spinning was to be carried out on hand-powered [[Spinning jenny|spinning jennies]], with a waterwheel (costing £450) powering the [[carding]] machines. By 1816 the mill contained [[worsted]] spinning frames, and in 1822 a new waterwheel costing £1,500 had been installed.

The main mill building was expanded at various times, with a two story extension added to the north; a fireproof stone staircase to the east; a wheelhouse; a fourth floor to the main building; and an adjacent [[combing]] shed built over the tail race leat flowing from the waterwheel.

Steam power came to the mill in three major building phases. In 1865 a beam engine house was built, together with a boiler house and the first chimney on the site. In the 1890s a second beam engine arrived, the boiler house was extended and the existing chimney built, and then in 1910 the existing horizontal engine was fitted, the Green's [[economiser]] house added and the boiler house extended again.
[[File:Coldharbour Mill steam engine - geograph.org.uk - 682088.jpg|thumb|The Pollit and Wigzell cross-compound engine, which drives the rope race seen in the background, transmitting power to line shafts on all five levels of the mill.]]

The mill site contains a wide variety of subsidiary buildings, including stabling, a [[linhay]], a gas retort house (see below), a carpenter's workshop, an air raid shelter from WWII, worker's cottages, and the manager's house. The tail race which takes the water away from the waterwheel is unusual in that it runs under the combing shed in a wide culvert, before briefly reappearing and then running underground again for some 200 metres.

==Sources of power==

Coldharbour Mill is unusual to have used both water and steam power right up to the time of its demise as a commercial venture. The water power was believed to have been used for the night shift up until 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, David and Dibnah, Fred ''Fred Dibnah's Age of Steam'' Random House 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water power===

The English Heritage report states "it is possible that the wheel pit and parts of the wheel itself are the remnants of the new wheel which was recorded in the Stock Book of 1822...and should be considered of considerable historic significance".&lt;ref name=CBR /&gt; The cast and wrought iron high [[water wheel|breast-shot]] wheel is 18 feet in diameter by 14 feet wide, with 48 buckets. It is part of a very unusual survival of a combined water and steam powered drive system, as it continued to be used after the 1910 addition of the horizontal steam engine, and the drive mechanism is still in place. The wheel is turning most days.

===Steam power===
[[File:Coldharbour Mill - beam engine - geograph.org.uk - 2204582.jpg|thumb|The restored [[Peter Brotherhood|Kittoe and Brotherhood]] beam engine at Coldharbour, which is steamed up regularly on Bank Holiday weekends.]]

Thomas Fox's brother Edward was part owner of a Cornish mine, and was instrumental in installing an early example of a [[Boulton and Watt]] engine. Edward told Thomas about this new technology, with the result that [[James Watt]] was invited to Wellington in 1782, just six months after his patent for the [[sun and planet gear]] that allowed reciprocating motion. Thomas missed the meeting, but wrote to him afterwards: {{quote|Wellington 25th fourth month 1782
I was very sorry to miss the opportunity of seeing thee when so obliging as to call on us at my brothers request, with whom I had lately been conversing on some proposed improvement of thine for stamping mills, to be worked by steam with a very small quantity of fire. I hinted to him my apprehensions that the same principle might be applied to fulling mills and rendered very extensively useful when water was scarce...On thy return through this country it would be esteemed a particular favour couldst thee favour us with a day or two of thy company.&lt;ref name=QH /&gt;}}
However, the visit came to nothing, partly due to the very high cost of coal, and partly due to the discontent about mechanisation, which would culminate in the later [[Luddite]] Movement. A letter in 1785 from Thomas states {{quote|We do not much wonder at manufacturers being individually fearful of introducing new machines, since, however useful, the first promoters usually suffer from popular violence without being sufficiently protected by the laws."&lt;ref name=QH /&gt;}}
Thus it was that the first mechanised wool spinning machinery, purchased from [[Jonathan Backhouse (1779–1842)|Backhouse of Darlington]], were powered by horses. These arrived in September 1791, bringing the [[Industrial Revolution]] to the West Country. It was evident from a letter of 1786 that Thomas wished he could have had a cheap source of coal, as in those parts of the country fed by canals: {{quote|When we consider the situation in this part of the country and what distresses our poor sufferer for want of fuel and how many manufactures for that reason cannot be carried on, we lament the fact that the fine coal which abounds in the Mendippe Hills is not rendered more generally useful by some navigable cuts through a country they would at the same time help to drain.&lt;ref name=QH /&gt;}}

Although the Wellington mill purchased a steam engine for £90 (and a £20 boiler) in 1840,&lt;ref name=WMW /&gt; Coldharbour Mill did not get a steam engine until 1865, by which time the [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]] was supplying cheap coal to Tiverton Junction. The mill has two [[Lancashire boiler]]s in the boiler house, only one of which is still operational. Initially a 25&amp;nbsp;hp [[beam engine]] was installed, followed by a second beam engine in the 1890s (possibly 1896). A Pollit &amp; Wigzell 300&amp;nbsp;hp, [[cross compound engine]] superseded the beam engines in 1910 and continued in use, along with the water wheel, until Fox Brothers closed the mill in April 1981. Today the cross compound steam engine&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coldharboursteam.org.uk/page16.html Coldharbour Steam Group Pollit and Wigzell mill engine]&lt;/ref&gt; remains fully operational and runs regularly at steam up weekends. It drives the shafting on all five floors of the mill via an operational [[Belt and rope drive|rope drive]]. In 1993 a salvaged 1867 [[Peter Brotherhood|Kittoe and Brotherhood]] beam engine was painstakingly restored and installed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coldharboursteam.org.uk/page7.html|title=Beam Engine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the mill, in one of the disused beam engine sheds. 
[[File:PSM V39 D313 A noble comb.jpg|thumb|An 1891 advertisement for a Noble combing machine, similar to those extant at Coldharbour Mill.]]
[[File:Gill-box.jpg|thumb|A Victorian gill box showing the principal action.]]

The mill contains a number of other steam powered exhibits, including a working Ashworth fire pump, already at Coldharbour, but repaired in 1984 with components from Bliss Mill; a very rare example of a low pressure wagon boiler dating from the late 1700s; and a (non-operational) steam powered flue fan.

===Electrical power===
Coldharbour Mill also had a small water turbine for electricity generation, which used the 14 foot head of water between the upper leat and the tail race. No references have been found to it in any register of Devon [[hydro-electric]] schemes, and it was unlikely to have generated any more than 3&amp;nbsp;kW peak power. The exit is visible today in the tail race leat, but nothing else is believed to exist.

Two generators  were installed in the beam engine house after the beam engines were removed and these were driven by the Pollit and Wigzell engine. The flat belt pulley system is still in existence. It is believed that this was used for lighting rather than running the machines.

===Gas production===
Coldharbour Mill generated its own coal gas on site for lighting the mill (and thus enabling the machinery to be run all night). Although the retorts have been removed and disposed of, the Gas Retort house which housed the [[History of manufactured gas#Retort bench|retort bench]] is still standing. In fact, the original gas retorts have been discovered in the leat, where they served as weir components. English Heritage classifies the late 19th century Gas Retort House as ''a very rare survival'' of gas-making facilities.

==Textile machinery==

At the time of its closure in April 1981, Coldharbour Mill still had its textile machinery in position. The majority of these machines have been preserved (though not all are exhibited), and have been augmented with weaving machines rescued from the closure of the Tonedale site. The lowest part of the site, the level 1 combing shed, dealt with the initial cleaning and combing of the unwashed wool. The process involved a number of separate stages, each with a specialised machine. The eight opening gill machines (made by Taylor Wadsworth &amp; Co)opened up the fleeces and prepared the wool for washing in a large back-washer with steam heated rollers. Following the washing, further gill boxes produced successively combed fibres, which were passed to a circular Noble combing machine.  This machine separated the fibres into long "Tops" and the short poor quality fibres. Although these machines are preserved on site, they are no longer in use today. British wool tops are purchased in, dyed into standard colours, and then up to ten strands of tops are fed into the Intersecting Gill Box (manufactured by [[Prince-Smith baronets|Prince Smith and Stells]] in 1959).  The gill box starts the process of drawing out the fibres, and also enables new colours to be created by blending together the standard colours. The output of the gill box is termed a [[Sliver (textiles)|sliver]]. This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant. 
The next process is to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to strengthen the resulting slubbing such that it can be wound onto a [[bobbin]]. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for [[Aran sweater|Aran]] yarn production, it is termed a [[roving]], and is sent on to the [[spinning frame]]. However, if the slubbing is for [[double knitting]] yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.

==The museum today==

The museum is owned and run by a not-for-profit charitable trust, Registered Charity No. 1123386. It has a number of educational programmes for schools including Victorian Drama; Materials &amp; Fibres; and Britain at War.

The mill is home to a number of other exhibits:
* A large collection of some 25 modern [[dolls houses]] by a local artist.
* A [[World War Two]] exhibit.
* A model railway depicting the [[Culm Valley Light Railway]].
* A large five panel tapestry, the [[Blackdown Hills|Blackdowns]] Millennium Tapestry, showing a 3D plan of the local parishes of [[Willand]], [[Uffculme]], [[Culmstock]], [[Hemyock]] and [[Clayhidon]].
* A large number of hand looms which are used by professional artist Louise Cottey to teach weaving classes.
* Extensive displays on puttee manufacturing.
* The West Country Historic Omnibus &amp; Transport Trust archive.
* Visiting exhibitions.

A '''cooling tower''' is a heat rejection device that rejects [[waste heat]] to the [[atmosphere]] through the cooling of a water stream to a lower temperature. Cooling towers may either use the [[evaporation]] of water to remove process heat and cool the working fluid to near the [[Wet-bulb temperature|wet-bulb air temperature]] or, in the case of ''closed circuit dry cooling towers'', rely solely on air to cool the working fluid to near the  [[Dry-bulb temperature|dry-bulb air temperature]].

Common applications include cooling the circulating water used in [[oil refineries]], [[petrochemical]] and other  [[chemical plant]]s, [[thermal power station]]s and [[HVAC]] systems for cooling buildings. The classification is based on the type of air induction into the tower: the main types of cooling towers are [[Natural convection|natural draft]] and [[Forced convection|induced draft]] cooling towers.

Cooling towers vary in size from small roof-top units to very large [[hyperboloid structure]]s (as in the adjacent image) that can be up to {{convert|200|m|ft}} tall and {{convert|100|m|ft}} in diameter, or rectangular structures that can be over {{convert|40|m|ft}} tall and {{convert|80|m|ft}} long. The hyperboloid cooling towers are often associated with [[nuclear power plant]]s,&lt;ref&gt;CleanEnergy Footprints (cleanenergy.org). [http://blog.cleanenergy.org/2012/12/31/identifying-nuclear-reactors-in-google-earth/ ''Identifying Nuclear Reactors in Google Earth''] Retrieved 5/19/2014&lt;/ref&gt; although they are also used in some coal-fired plants and to some extent in some large chemical and other industrial plants. Although these large towers are very prominent, the vast majority of cooling towers are much smaller, including many units installed on or near buildings to discharge heat from [[air conditioning]].

==History==
[[File:Barnard's fanless self-cooling tower.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1902 engraving of "Barnard's fanless self-cooling tower", an early large evaporative cooling tower that relied on [[Natural Draft|natural draft]] and open sides rather than a fan; water to be cooled was sprayed from the top onto the radial pattern of vertical wire-mesh mats.]]

Cooling towers originated in the 19th century through the development of [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]s for use with the [[steam engine]].&lt;ref name=ICS1902a&gt;{{cite book |author=International Correspondence Schools |date=1902 |title=A Textbook on Steam Engineering |publisher=International Textbook Co. |location=Scranton, Pa. |at=33–34 of Section 29:"Condensers" |url=https://archive.org/details/textbookonsteame04inteiala}}&lt;/ref&gt; Condensers use relatively cool water, via various means, to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines.

By the turn of the 20th century, several evaporative methods of recycling cooling water were in use in areas lacking an established water supply, as well as in urban locations where municipal water mains may not be of sufficient supply; reliable in times of demand; or otherwise adequate to meet cooling needs.&lt;ref name=ICS1902a /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Engineer 1906" /&gt; In areas with available land, the systems took the form of [[cooling pond]]s; in areas with limited land, such as in cities, they took the form of cooling towers.&lt;ref name="Heck 1911"&gt;{{cite book |last=Heck |first=Robert Culbertson Hays |date=1911 |title=The Steam Engine and Turbine: A Text-Book for Engineering Colleges |publisher=D.

==Classification by use==
===Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)===
[[File:Loop Shopping Centre Exterior I.jpg|thumb|Two HVAC cooling towers on the rooftop of a shopping center (Germany)]]
{{main|HVAC}}

An [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) cooling tower is used to dispose of ("reject") unwanted heat from a [[chiller]]. Water-cooled chillers are normally more energy efficient than air-cooled chillers due to [[heat rejection]] to tower water at or near [[wet-bulb temperature]]s.  Air-cooled chillers must reject heat at the higher [[dry-bulb temperature]], and thus have a lower average reverse-[[Carnot cycle]] effectiveness. In areas with a hot climate, large office buildings, hospitals, and schools typically use one or more cooling towers as part of their air conditioning systems.  Generally, industrial cooling towers are much larger than HVAC towers.

HVAC use of a cooling tower pairs the cooling tower with a water-cooled chiller or water-cooled condenser. A [[Refrigeration#Capacity ratings|''ton'' of air-conditioning]] is defined as the removal of 12,000 [[British thermal unit|BTU/hour]] (3500 W). The ''equivalent ton'' on the cooling tower side actually rejects about 15,000 BTU/hour (4400 W) due to the additional waste heat-equivalent of the energy needed to drive the chiller's compressor. This ''equivalent ton'' is defined as the heat rejection in cooling 3 US gallons/minute (1,500 pound/hour) of water 10&amp;nbsp;°F (6&amp;nbsp;°C), which amounts to 15,000 BTU/hour, assuming a chiller [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) of 4.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cheremisinoff|first1=Nicholas|title=Handbook of Chemical Processing Equipment|date=2000|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=9780080523828|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; This COP is equivalent to an energy efficiency ratio (EER) of 14.

Cooling towers are also used in HVAC systems that have multiple water source [[heat pumps]] that share a common piping ''water loop''. In this type of system, the water circulating inside the water loop removes heat from the condenser of the heat pumps whenever the heat pumps are working in the cooling mode, then the externally mounted cooling tower is used to remove heat from the water loop and reject it to the [[atmosphere]].  By contrast, when the heat pumps are working in heating mode, the condensers draw heat out of the loop water and reject it into the space to be heated.  When the water loop is being used primarily to supply heat to the building, the cooling tower is normally shut down (and may be drained or winterized to prevent freeze damage), and heat is supplied by other means, usually from separate [[boiler]]s.

===Industrial cooling towers===
[[File:Cenk Endustri Field Erected Industrial Cooling Tower.JPG|thumb|Industrial cooling towers for a power plant]]
[[File:Industrial Counterflow Cooling Towers.jpg|thumb|Industrial Cooling Towers for Fruit Processing Industry ]]
Industrial cooling towers can be used to remove heat from various sources such as machinery or heated process material.  The primary use of large, industrial cooling towers is to remove the heat absorbed in the circulating [[cooling water]] systems used in [[power plants]], [[oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], [[petrochemical]] plants, [[natural gas]] processing plants, food processing plants, semi-conductor plants, and for other industrial facilities such as in condensers of distillation columns, for cooling liquid in crystallization, etc.&lt;ref&gt;

Furthermore, discharging large amounts of hot water may raise the temperature of the receiving river or lake to an unacceptable level for the local ecosystem. Elevated water temperatures can kill fish and other aquatic organisms (see ''[[thermal pollution]]''), or can also cause an increase in undesirable organisms such as invasive species of [[zebra mussel]]s or [[algae]]. A cooling tower serves to dissipate the heat into the atmosphere instead and wind and air diffusion spreads the heat over a much larger area than hot water can distribute heat in a body of water. Evaporative cooling water cannot be used for subsequent purposes (other than rain somewhere), whereas surface-only cooling water can be re-used.
Some coal-fired and [[nuclear power plant]]s located in [[coastal]] areas do make use of once-through ocean water. But even there, the offshore discharge water outlet requires very careful design to avoid environmental problems.

Petroleum refineries also have very large cooling tower systems. A typical large refinery processing 40,000 metric tonnes of crude oil per day ({{convert|300000|oilbbl}} per day) circulates about 80,000 cubic metres of water per hour through its cooling tower system.

==Classification by build==

=== Package type ===
[[File:Field_Errected_Cooling_Towers.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Field_Errected_Cooling_Towers.jpg|thumb|Field Erected Cooling Towers]]
[[File:Brotep_Eco_coolin_tower.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Brotep_Eco_coolin_tower.jpg|thumb|Brotep-Eco cooling tower]]
[[File:Package_type_cooling_tower.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Package_type_cooling_tower.JPG|thumb|Package cooling tower]]
These types of cooling towers are factory preassembled, and can be simply transported on trucks, as they are compact machines. The capacity of package type towers is limited and, for that reason, they are usually preferred by facilities with low heat rejection requirements such as food processing plants, textile plants, some chemical processing plants, or buildings like hospitals, hotels, malls, automotive factories etc.

Due to their frequent use in or near residential areas, sound level control is a relatively more important issue for package type cooling towers.

=== Field erection type ===
Facilities such as power plants, steel processing plants, petroleum refineries, or petrochemical plants usually install field erected type cooling towers due to their greater capacity for heat rejection. Field erected towers are usually much larger in size compared to the package type cooling towers.

A typical field erected cooling tower has a [[Pultrusion|pultruded]] [[fiber-reinforced plastic]] (FRP) structure, FRP [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]], a mechanical unit for [[air draft]], drift eliminator, and fill.

==Heat transfer methods==
With respect to the [[heat transfer]] mechanism employed, the main types are:
* '''dry cooling towers''' operate by [[heat transfer]] through a surface that separates the working fluid from ambient air, such as in a tube to air [[heat exchanger]], utilizing convective heat transfer. They do not use evaporation.
* '''wet cooling towers''' (or '''open circuit cooling towers''') operate on the principle of [[evaporative cooling]].  The working fluid and the evaporated fluid (usually water) are one and the same.
* '''fluid coolers''' (or '''closed circuit cooling towers''') are hybrids that pass the working fluid through a tube bundle, upon which clean water is sprayed and a fan-induced draft applied.  The resulting heat transfer performance is much closer to that of a wet cooling tower, with the advantage provided by a dry cooler of protecting the working fluid from environmental exposure and contamination.

In a wet cooling tower (or open circuit cooling tower), the warm water can be cooled to a temperature ''lower'' than the ambient air dry-bulb temperature, if the air is relatively dry (see [[dew point]] and [[psychrometrics]]). As ambient air is drawn past a flow of water, a small portion of the water evaporates, and the energy required to evaporate that portion of the water is taken from the remaining mass of water, thus reducing its temperature. Approximately 970 BTU of heat energy is absorbed for each pound of evaporated water (2 MJ/kg). Evaporation results in saturated air conditions, lowering the temperature of the water processed by the tower to a value close to [[wet-bulb temperature]], which is lower than the ambient [[dry-bulb temperature]], the difference determined by the initial humidity of the ambient air.

To achieve better performance (more cooling), a medium called ''fill'' is used to increase the surface area and the time of contact between the air and water flows. ''Splash fill'' consists of material placed to interrupt the water flow causing splashing. ''Film fill'' is composed of thin sheets of material (usually [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]) upon which the water flows.  Both methods create increased surface area and time of contact between the fluid (water) and the gas (air), to improve heat transfer.

==Air flow generation methods==
[[File:Stairway to nowhere^ - geograph.org.uk - 455003.jpg|thumb|Access stairs at the base of a massive hyperboloid cooling tower give a sense of its scale (UK)]]
With respect to drawing air through the tower, there are three types of cooling towers:
* '''[[Natural draught|Natural draft]]''' — Utilizes buoyancy via a tall chimney.  Warm, moist air ''naturally'' rises due to the density differential compared to the dry, cooler outside air. Warm [[Lighter than air#Water vapour|moist air]] is less dense than drier air at the same pressure.  This moist air buoyancy produces an upwards current of air through the tower.
* '''Mechanical draft''' — Uses power-driven fan motors to force or draw air through the tower.
** '''Induced draft''' — A mechanical draft tower with a fan at the discharge (at the top) which pulls air up through the tower. The fan ''induces'' hot moist air out the discharge. This produces low entering and high exiting air velocities, reducing the possibility of ''recirculation'' in which discharged air flows back into the air intake.  This fan/fin arrangement is also known as ''draw-through''. 
** '''Forced draft''' — A mechanical draft tower with a blower type fan at the intake. The fan ''forces'' air into the tower, creating high entering and low exiting air velocities. The low exiting velocity is much more susceptible to recirculation. With the fan on the air intake, the fan is more susceptible to complications due to freezing conditions. Another disadvantage is that a forced draft design typically requires more motor horsepower than an equivalent induced draft design. The benefit of the forced draft design is its ability to work with high [[static pressure]]. Such setups can be installed in more-confined spaces and even in some indoor situations. This fan/fin geometry is also known as ''blow-through''.
* '''Fan assisted natural draft''' — A hybrid type that appears like a natural draft setup, though airflow is assisted by a fan.

[[hyperboloid structure|Hyperboloid]] (sometimes incorrectly known as [[hyperbolic paraboloid|hyperbolic]]) cooling towers have become the design standard for all natural-draft cooling towers because of their structural strength and minimum usage of material. The hyperboloid shape also aids in accelerating the upward [[convection|convective]] air flow, improving cooling efficiency.  These designs are popularly associated with [[nuclear power plant]]s.  However, this association is misleading, as the same kind of cooling towers are often used at large coal-fired power plants as well. Conversely, not all nuclear power plants have cooling towers,  and some instead cool their heat exchangers with lake, river or ocean water.

Thermal efficiencies up to 92% have been observed in hybrid cooling towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gul|first=S.|date=2015-06-18|title=Optimizing the performance of Hybrid: Induced-Forced Draft Cooling Tower|url=http://www.piche.org.pk/journal/index.php?journal=jpiche&amp;page=article&amp;op=view&amp;path%5B%5D=192|journal=Journal of the Pakistan Institute of Chemical Engineers|language=en|volume=43|issue=2|issn=1813-4092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categorization by air-to-water flow==

===Crossflow===
[[File:Crossflow diagram.svg|thumb|left]]
[[File:factory assembled crossflow.jpg|thumb|Mechanical draft crossflow cooling tower used in an HVAC application]]
[[File:Crossflow cooling tower.jpg|thumb|Package crossflow cooling tower]]Typically lower initial and long-term cost, mostly due to pump requirements.
Crossflow is a design in which the air flow is directed perpendicular to the water flow (see diagram at left). Air flow enters one or more vertical faces of the cooling tower to meet the fill material. Water flows (perpendicular to the air) through the fill by gravity. The air continues through the fill and thus past the water flow into an open plenum volume. Lastly, a fan forces the air out into the atmosphere.

A ''distribution'' or ''hot water basin'' consisting of a deep pan with holes or ''nozzles'' in its bottom is located near the top of a crossflow tower. Gravity distributes the water through the nozzles uniformly across the fill material.

Advantages of the crossflow design:
* Gravity water distribution allows smaller pumps and maintenance while in use.
* Non-pressurized spray simplifies variable flow.

Disadvantages of the crossflow design:
* More prone to freezing than counterflow designs.
* Variable flow is useless in some conditions.
* More prone to dirt buildup in the fill than counterflow designs, especially in dusty or sandy areas.

===Counterflow===
[[File:Counterflow Cooling Towers.jpg|thumb|Induced Draft Counterflow Cooling Towers]]
[[File:Counterflow diagram.svg|thumb|left]]
[[File:Crossflow Cooling tower.jpg|thumb|Forced draft counter flow package type cooling towers]]
In a counterflow design, the air flow is directly opposite to the water flow (see diagram at left). Air flow first enters an open area beneath the fill media, and is then drawn up vertically. The water is sprayed through pressurized nozzles near the top of the tower, and then flows downward through the fill, opposite to the air flow.

&lt;br/&gt;
Advantages of the counterflow design:
* Spray water distribution makes the tower more freeze-resistant.
* Breakup of water in spray makes heat transfer more efficient.
&lt;br/&gt;
Disadvantages of the counterflow design:
* Typically higher initial and long-term cost, primarily due to pump requirements.
* Difficult to use variable water flow, as spray characteristics may be negatively affected.
* Typically noisier, due to the greater water fall height from the bottom of the fill into the cold water basin

===Common aspects===
Common aspects of both designs:
*The interactions of the air and water flow allow a partial equalization of temperature, and evaporation of water.
*The air, now saturated with water vapor, is discharged from the top of the cooling tower.
*A "collection basin" or "cold water basin" is used to collect and contain the cooled water after its interaction with the air flow.

Both crossflow and counterflow designs can be used in natural draft and in mechanical draft cooling towers.

==Wet cooling tower material balance==
Quantitatively, the material balance around a wet, evaporative cooling tower system is governed by the operational variables of make-up [[volumetric flow rate]], [[evaporation]] and windage losses, draw-off rate, and the concentration cycles.&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;{{cite book | author=Beychok, Milton R. | title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]] |edition=1st | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | year=1967|id=[[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN 67019834]]}} (available in many university libraries)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beychok2&gt;{{cite journal| author=Milton R. Beychok|date=October 1952|title=How To Calculate Cooling Tower Control Variables|journal= Petroleum Processing| volume=|issue=|pages=1452–1456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the adjacent diagram, water pumped from the tower basin is the cooling water routed through the process coolers and [[condenser (steam turbine)|condensers]] in an industrial facility.  The cool water absorbs heat from the hot process streams which need to be cooled or condensed, and the absorbed heat warms the circulating water (C). The warm water returns to the top of the cooling tower and trickles downward over the fill material inside the tower.  As it trickles down, it contacts ambient air rising up through the tower either by natural draft or by forced draft using large fans in the tower. That contact causes a small amount of the water to be lost as windage/drift (W) and some of the water (E) to [[evaporation|evaporate]]. The heat required to evaporate the water is derived from the water itself, which cools the water back to the original basin water temperature and the water is then ready to recirculate. The evaporated water leaves its dissolved [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s behind in the bulk of the water which has not been evaporated, thus raising the salt concentration in the circulating cooling water. To prevent the salt concentration of the water from becoming too high, a portion of the water is drawn off/blown down (D) for disposal. Fresh water make-up (M) is supplied to the tower basin to compensate for the loss of evaporated water, the windage loss water and the draw-off water.

|-
|align=right| '''X'''
|align=left|= Concentration in [[parts per notation|ppmw]] (of any completely soluble salts ... usually chlorides)

|align=left|= parts per million by weight
|}

A water balance around the entire system is then:&lt;ref name=Beychok2/&gt;

:M = E + D + W

Since the evaporated water (E) has no salts, a chloride balance around the system is:&lt;ref name=Beychok2/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M X_M = D X_C + W X_C = X_C (D + W)&lt;/math&gt;

and, therefore:&lt;ref name=Beychok2/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; {X_C \over X_M} = \text{Cycles of concentration} ={ M \over (D + W)} = {M \over (M - E)} = 1 + {E \over (D + W)}&lt;/math&gt;

From a simplified heat balance around the cooling tower:

:&lt;math&gt; E = {C \Delta T c_p \over H_V} &lt;/math&gt;

|}

Windage (or drift) losses (W) is the amount of total tower water flow that is entrained in the flow of air to the atmosphere. From large-scale industrial cooling towers, in the absence of manufacturer's data, it may be assumed to be:

:'''W''' = 0.3 to 1.0 percent of C for a natural draft cooling tower without windage drift eliminators
:'''W''' = 0.1 to 0.3 percent of C for an induced draft cooling tower without windage drift eliminators
:'''W''' = about 0.005 percent of C (or less) if the cooling tower has windage drift eliminators
:'''W''' = about 0.0005 percent of C (or less) if the cooling tower has windage drift eliminators and uses sea water as make-up water.

===Cycles of concentration===
Cycle of concentration represents the accumulation of dissolved minerals in the recirculating cooling water. Discharge of draw-off (or blowdown) is used principally to control the buildup of these minerals.

The chemistry of the make-up water, including the amount of dissolved minerals, can vary widely. Make-up waters low in dissolved minerals such as those from surface water supplies (lakes, rivers etc.) tend to be aggressive to metals (corrosive). Make-up waters from [[ground water]] supplies (such as [[water well|wells]]) are usually higher in minerals, and tend to be [[Limescale|scaling]] (deposit minerals). Increasing the amount of minerals present in the water by cycling can make water less aggressive to piping; however, excessive levels of minerals can cause scaling problems.

[[File:Cycles-Of-Concentration.png|thumb|Relationship between cycles of concentration and flow rates in a cooling tower]] As the cycles of concentration increase, the water may not be able to hold the minerals in solution. When the [[solubility]] of these minerals have been exceeded they can [[precipitate]] out as mineral solids and cause fouling and heat exchange problems in the cooling tower or the [[heat exchangers]]. The temperatures of the recirculating water, piping and heat exchange surfaces determine if and where minerals will precipitate from the recirculating water.  Often a professional [[Industrial water treatment|water treatment]] consultant will evaluate the make-up water and the operating conditions of the cooling tower and recommend an appropriate range for the cycles of concentration. The use of water treatment chemicals, pretreatment such as [[water softening]], [[pH]] adjustment, and other techniques can affect the acceptable range of cycles of concentration.

Concentration cycles in the majority of cooling towers usually range from 3 to 7. In the United States, many water supplies use well water which has significant levels of dissolved solids. On the other hand, one of the largest water supplies, for [[New York City water supply system|New York City]], has a surface rainwater source quite low in minerals; thus cooling towers in that city are often allowed to concentrate to 7 or more cycles of concentration.

Since higher cycles of concentration represent less make-up water, [[water conservation]] efforts may focus on increasing cycles of concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://energy.gov/eere/femp/best-management-practice-cooling-tower-management |title = Best Management Practice Cooling Tower Management |publisher = Department of Energy |date = 30 April 2005 |website = Energy.gov |accessdate= 16 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Highly treated recycled water may be an effective means of reducing cooling tower consumption of potable water, in regions where potable water is scarce.&lt;ref name="Diego"&gt;{{cite journal | last = San Diego County Water Authority | date = July 2009 | title = Technical Information for Cooling Towers Using Recycled Water | url = http://www.sdcwa.org/sites/default/files/files/water-management/recycled/techinfo-cooling-towers.pdf | website = www.sdcwa.org | publisher    = San Diego County Water Authority | accessdate  = 18 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance==
Surfaces with any visible biofilm (i.e., slime) should be cleaned.

Disinfectant and other chemical levels in cooling towers and hot tubs should be continuously maintained and regularly monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/downloads/toolkit.pdf |title=Developing a Water Management Program to Reduce Legionella Growth &amp; Spread in Buildings: A Practical Guide to Implementing Industry Standards | publisher =CDC |date = 5 June 2017|page= 13 {17 of 32}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular checks of water quality (specifically the aerobic bacteria levels) using [[Dip slide|dipslides]] should be taken as the presence of other organisms can support legionella by producing the organic nutrients that it needs to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dip-slides.com/cooling-water/69-cooling-water-dipslides-box-of-10.html|title=Cooling Water Dipslides (Box of 10) - Dip-slides.com|website=Dip-slides.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water treatment===
{{see also|Industrial water treatment}}
Besides treating the circulating cooling water in large industrial cooling tower systems to minimize scaling and [[fouling]], the water should be [[Filter (water)|filtered]] to remove particulates, and also be dosed with [[biocide]]s and [[algaecide]]s to prevent growths that could interfere with the continuous flow of the water.&lt;ref name=Beychok/&gt; Under certain conditions, a [[biofilm]] of micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungi and algae can grow very rapidly in the cooling water, and can reduce the heat transfer efficiency of the cooling tower. Biofilm can be reduced or prevented by using [[chlorine]] or other chemicals. A normal industrial practice is to use two biocides, such as oxidizing and non-oxidizing types to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and to ensure a broader spectrum of attack. In most cases, a continual low level oxidizing biocide is used, then alternating to a periodic shock dose of non-oxidizing biocides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bvwater.co.uk/cooling-water-system-chemicals/ |title=B &amp; V Group, Cooling Water System Chemical Range, Non-Oxidising Biocides |access-date=14 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829064240/http://www.bvwater.co.uk/cooling-water-system-chemicals/#.WFFOPqZ4e7k |archive-date=29 August 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
====Legionnaires' disease====
[[File:Legionella pneumophila (SEM) 2.jpg|thumb|''Legionella pneumophila'' (5000x magnification)]]
{{further|Legionellosis|Legionella}}

Another very important reason for using biocides in cooling towers is to prevent the growth of ''[[Legionella]]'', including species that cause [[legionellosis]] or Legionnaires' disease, most notably ''L. pneumophila'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ryan K.J.; Ray C.G. (editors)|title=Sherris Medical Microbiology|edition=4th|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2004|isbn=0-8385-8529-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Mycobacterium avium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/4/3/pdfs/v4-n3.pdf Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – Emerging Infectious Diseases]&amp;thinsp; (page 495)&lt;/ref&gt; The various ''Legionella'' species are the cause of Legionnaires' disease in humans and transmission is via exposure to [[particulate|aerosol]]s—the inhalation of mist droplets containing the bacteria. Common sources of ''Legionella'' include cooling towers used in open recirculating evaporative cooling water systems, domestic hot water systems, fountains, and similar disseminators that tap into a public water supply. Natural sources include freshwater ponds and creeks.&lt;ref name=Cun2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cunha|first1=BA|last2=Burillo|first2=A|last3=Bouza|first3=E|title=Legionnaires' disease.|journal=Lancet|date=23 January 2016|volume=387|issue=10016|pages=376–85|pmid=26231463|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(15)60078-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC2016Start&gt;{{cite web|title=Legionella (Legionnaires' Disease and Pontiac Fever) About the Disease|url=https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/index.html|website=CDC|accessdate=17 June 2017 |date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French researchers found that ''Legionella'' bacteria travelled up to {{convert|6|km|mi}} through the air from a large contaminated cooling tower at a petrochemical plant in Pas-de-Calais, France. That outbreak killed 21 of the 86 people who had a laboratory-confirmed infection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080922134426/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/521680 Airborne Legionella May Travel Several Kilometres] (access requires free registration)  &lt;/ref&gt;

Drift (or windage) is the term for water droplets of the process flow allowed to escape in the cooling tower discharge. Drift eliminators are used in order to hold drift rates typically to 0.001–0.005% of the circulating flow rate. A typical drift eliminator provides multiple directional changes of airflow to prevent the escape of water droplets. A well-designed and well-fitted drift eliminator can greatly reduce water loss and potential for ''Legionella'' or water treatment chemical exposure.

The CDC does not recommend that health-care facilities regularly test for the ''Legionella pneumophila'' bacteria. Scheduled microbiologic monitoring for ''Legionella'' remains controversial because its presence is not necessarily evidence of a potential for causing disease. The CDC recommends aggressive disinfection measures for cleaning and maintaining devices known to transmit ''Legionella'', but does not recommend regularly-scheduled microbiologic assays for the bacteria. However, scheduled monitoring of potable water within a hospital might be considered in certain settings where persons are highly susceptible to illness and mortality from ''Legionella'' infection (e.g. [[hematopoietic stem cell]] transplantation units, or solid organ transplant units).  Also, after an outbreak of legionellosis, health officials agree that monitoring is necessary to identify the source and to evaluate the efficacy of biocides or other prevention measures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/eic_in_HCF_03.pdf CDC Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities, pages 223 &amp; 224, Water Sampling Strategies and Culture Techniques for Detecting Legionellae]&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found ''Legionella'' in 40% to 60% of cooling towers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cti.org/downloads/WTP-148.pdf Cooling Tower Institute, July 2008. Page 5 of 12, column 1, paragraph 3. Most professional and government agencies do not recommend testing for ''Legionella'' bacteria on a routine basis.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Floor of cooling tower, Iru Power Plant, 2.jpg|thumb|Fill plates at the bottom of the [[Iru Power Plant]] cooling tower (Estonia).  Tower is shut down, revealing numerous water spray heads.]]

{{anchor |Windage|Drift}}
*'''Windage''' or '''Drift''' — Water droplets that are carried out of the cooling tower with the exhaust air. Drift droplets have the same concentration of impurities as the water entering the tower. The drift rate is typically reduced by employing baffle-like devices, called drift eliminators, through which the air must travel after leaving the fill and spray zones of the tower.  Drift can also be reduced by using warmer entering cooling tower temperatures.
{{anchor |Blow-out}}
*'''Blow-out''' — Water droplets blown out of the cooling tower by wind, generally at the air inlet openings. Water may also be lost, in the absence of wind, through splashing or misting. Devices such as wind screens, louvers, splash deflectors and water diverters are used to limit these losses.
{{anchor |Plume}}
*'''Plume''' — The stream of saturated exhaust air leaving the cooling tower. The plume is visible when water vapor it contains condenses in contact with cooler ambient air, like the saturated air in one's breath fogs on a cold day. Under certain conditions, a cooling tower plume may present fogging or icing hazards to its surroundings. Note that the water evaporated in the cooling process is "pure" water, in contrast to the very small percentage of drift droplets or water blown out of the air inlets.
{{anchor |Draw-off|Blow-down}}
*'''Draw-off''' or '''Blow-down''' — The portion of the circulating water flow that is removed (usually discharged to a drain) in order to maintain the amount of [[Total Dissolved Solids]] (TDS) and other impurities at an acceptably low level.  Higher TDS concentration in solution may result from greater cooling tower efficiency. However the higher the TDS concentration, the greater the risk of scale, biological growth and corrosion. The amount of blow-down is primarily designated by measuring by the [[electrical conductivity]] of the circulating water. Biological growth, scaling and corrosion can be prevented by chemicals (respectively, biocide, sulfuric acid, corrosion inhibitor). On the other hand, the only practical way to decrease the electrical conductivity is by increasing the amount of blow-down discharge and subsequently increasing the amount of clean make-up water.
{{anchor |Zero bleed for cooling towers|Zero}}
* '''Zero bleed for cooling towers''', also called '''zero blow-down for cooling towers''', is a process for significantly reducing the need for bleeding [[water]] with residual [[solid]]s from the system by enabling the water to hold more solids in [[solution]].&lt;ref name=WilliamHClark1997 &gt;{{citation | author=William H Clark | year=1997 | title=Retrofitting for energy conservation | publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional | isbn=978-0-07-011920-8  | page=66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=InstituteofIndustrialEngineers1981-1982 &gt;{{citation | author=Institute of Industrial Engineers 1981–  | year=1982 | title=Proceedings, Volume 1982 | publisher=Institute of Industrial Engineers/American Institute of Industrial Engineers  | page=101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mathie1998 &gt;{{citation | last=Mathie | first=Alton J. | year=1998 | title=Chemical treatment for cooling water | publisher=Fairmont Press | isbn=978-0-88173-253-5  | page=86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{anchor |Make-up}}
*'''Make-up''' — The water that must be added to the circulating water system in order to compensate for water losses such as evaporation, drift loss, blow-out, blow-down, etc.
{{anchor |Noise}}
*'''Noise''' — Sound energy emitted by a cooling tower and heard (recorded) at a given distance and direction. The sound is generated by the impact of falling water, by the movement of air by fans, the fan blades moving in the structure, vibration of the structure, and the motors, gearboxes or drive belts.
{{anchor |Approach}}
*'''Approach''' — The approach is the difference in temperature between the cooled-water temperature and the entering-air [[Wet-bulb temperature|wet bulb temperature]] (twb). Since the cooling towers are based on the principles of evaporative cooling, the maximum cooling tower efficiency depends on the wet bulb temperature of the air.  The wet-bulb temperature is a type of temperature measurement that reflects the physical properties of a system with a mixture of a gas and a vapor, usually air and water vapor
{{anchor |Range}}
*'''Range''' — The range is the temperature difference between the warm water inlet and cooled water exit.
{{anchor |Fill}}
*'''Fill''' — Inside the tower, fills are added to increase contact surface as well as contact time between air and water, to provide better heat transfer. The efficiency of the tower depends on the selection and amount of fill. There are two types of fills that may be used:
**'''Film type fill''' (causes water to spread into a thin film)
**'''Splash type fill''' (breaks up falling stream of water and interrupts its vertical progress)
{{anchor |Full-Flow Filtration|Full-Flow}}
*'''Full-Flow Filtration''' — Full-flow filtration continuously strains particulates out of the entire system flow. For example, in a 100-ton system, the flow rate would be roughly 300 gal/min. A filter would be selected to accommodate the entire 300 gal/min flow rate. In this case, the filter typically is installed after the cooling tower on the discharge side of the pump. While this is the ideal method of filtration, for higher flow systems it may be cost-prohibitive.
{{anchor |Side-Stream Filtration|Side-Stream}}
*'''Side-Stream Filtration''' — Side-stream filtration, although popular and effective, does not provide complete protection. With side-stream filtration, a portion of the water is filtered continuously. This method works on the principle that continuous particle removal will keep the system clean. Manufacturers typically package side-stream filters on a skid, complete with a pump and controls. For high flow systems, this method is cost-effective. Properly sizing a side-stream filtration system is critical to obtain satisfactory filter performance, but there is some debate over how to properly size the side-stream system. Many engineers size the system to continuously filter the cooling tower basin water at a rate equivalent to 10% of the total circulation flow rate. For example, if the total flow of a system is 1,200 gal/min (a 400-ton system), a 120 gal/min side-stream system is specified.
{{anchor |Cycle of concentration|Cycle}}
*'''Cycle of concentration''' — Maximum allowed multiplier for the amount of miscellaneous substances in circulating water compared to the amount of those substances in make-up water.
{{anchor |Treated timber|Treated}}
*'''Treated timber''' — A structural material for cooling towers which was largely abandoned about 10 years ago.{{When|date=March 2012}}  It is still used occasionally due to its low initial costs, in spite of its short life expectancy. The life of treated timber varies a lot, depending on the operating conditions of the tower, such as frequency of shutdowns, treatment of the circulating water, etc. Under proper working conditions, the estimated life of treated timber structural members is about 10 years.
{{anchor |Leaching}}
*'''Leaching''' — The loss of wood preservative chemicals by the washing action of the water flowing through a wood structure cooling tower.
{{anchor |Pultruded FRP|Pultruded}}
*'''Pultruded FRP''' — A common structural material for smaller cooling towers, [[fibre-reinforced plastic]] (FRP) is known for its high corrosion-resistance capabilities. Pultruded FRP is produced using [[pultrusion]] technology, and has become the most common structural material for small cooling towers. It offers lower costs and requires less maintenance compared to reinforced concrete, which is still in use for large structures.

==Fog production==
[[File:Clouds, natural and otherwise - geograph.org.uk - 778331.jpg|thumb|Fog clouds produced by [[Eggborough power station|Eggborough Power Plant]] (UK)]]

Under certain ambient conditions, plumes of water vapor (fog) can be seen rising out of the discharge from a cooling tower, and can be mistaken as smoke from a fire.  If the outdoor air is at or near saturation, and the tower adds more water to the air, saturated air with liquid water droplets can be discharged, which is seen as fog.  This phenomenon typically occurs on cool, humid days, but is rare in many climates. Fog and clouds associated with cooling towers can be described as '''homogenitus''', as with other clouds of man-made origin, such as [[contrail]]s and [[ship track]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sutherland|first1=Scott|title=Cloud Atlas leaps into 21st century with 12 new cloud types|url=https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/cloud-atlas-leaps-into-21st-century-with-12-new-cloud-types/80685/|accessdate=24 March 2017|work=The Weather Network|agency=Pelmorex Media|date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon can be prevented by decreasing the relative humidity of the saturated discharge air. For that purpose, in hybrid towers, saturated discharge air is mixed with heated low relative humidity air. Some air enters the tower above drift eliminator level, passing through heat exchangers. The relative humidity of the dry air is even more decreased instantly as being heated while entering the tower. The discharged mixture has a relatively lower relative humidity and the fog is invisible.

==Salt emission pollution==
When wet cooling towers with seawater make-up are installed in various industries located in or near coastal areas, the drift of fine droplets emitted from the cooling towers contain nearly 6% sodium chloride which deposits on the nearby land areas. This deposition of sodium salts on the nearby agriculture/vegetative lands can convert them into [[Soil salinity control|sodic saline]] or [[Alkali soils|sodic alkaline soils]] depending on the nature of the soil and enhance the [[Sodium adsorption ratio|sodicity]] of ground and surface water. The salt deposition problem from such cooling towers aggravates where national pollution control standards are not imposed or not implemented to minimize the drift emissions from wet cooling towers using seawater make-up.&lt;ref name="wet cooling"&gt;[http://www.ec.gc.ca/inrp-npri/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=2ED8CFA7-1 Wet Cooling Tower Guidance For Particulate Matter, Environment Canada], Retrieved on 2013-01-29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Respirable suspended particle|Respirable suspended particulate matter]], of less than 10 [[micrometre|micrometers]] (µm) in size, can be present in the drift from cooling towers. Larger particles above 10&amp;nbsp;µm in size are generally filtered out in the nose and throat via cilia and mucus but particulate matter smaller than 10&amp;nbsp;µm, referred to as PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems. Similarly, particles smaller than 2.5&amp;nbsp;µm, (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;), tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung, and very small particles (less than 100 nanometers) may pass through the lungs to affect other organs. Though the total particulate emissions from wet cooling towers with fresh water make-up is much less, they contain more PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; than the total emissions from wet cooling towers with sea water make-up. This is due to lesser salt content in fresh water drift (below 2,000&amp;nbsp;ppm) compared to the salt content of sea water drift (60,000&amp;nbsp;ppm).&lt;ref name="wet cooling" /&gt;

==Use as a flue-gas stack==
[[File:Chimney included in cooling tower.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Flue gas stack inside a natural draft wet cooling tower]]
[[File:Power station Duisburg Walsum.JPG|thumb|Flue gas stack connection into a natural draft wet cooling tower]]
[[File:Песочин ТЭЦ5 Градирни VizuIMG 2181.JPG|thumb|Large [[hyperboloid]] cooling towers made of structural steel for a power plant in Kharkov (Ukraine)]]
At some modern power stations equipped with [[flue-gas desulfurization|flue gas purification]], such as the [[Großkrotzenburg Power Station]] and the [[Rostock Power Station]], the cooling tower is also used as a [[flue-gas stack]] (industrial chimney), thus saving the cost of a separate chimney structure. At plants without flue gas purification, problems with corrosion may occur, due to reactions of raw flue gas with water to form [[acid]]s.

Sometimes, natural draft cooling towers are constructed with structural steel in place of concrete (RCC) when the construction time of natural draft cooling tower is exceeding the construction time of the rest of the plant or the local soil is of poor strength to bear the heavy weight of RCC cooling towers or cement prices are higher at a site to opt for cheaper natural draft cooling towers made of structural steel.

==Operation in freezing weather==
Some cooling towers (such as smaller building air conditioning systems) are shut down seasonally, drained, and winterized to prevent freeze damage.

During the winter, other sites continuously operate cooling towers with {{convert|4|°C|°F|abbr=on}} water leaving the tower.  Basin heaters, tower draindown, and other freeze protection methods are often employed in cold climates. Operational cooling towers with malfunctions can freeze during very cold weather. Typically, freezing starts at the corners of a cooling tower with a reduced or absent heat load. Severe freezing conditions can create growing volumes of ice, resulting in increased structural loads which can cause structural damage or collapse.

To prevent freezing, the following procedures are used:
* The use of water modulating by-pass systems is not recommended during freezing weather. In such situations, the control flexibility of variable speed motors, two-speed motors, and/or two-speed motors multi-cell towers should be considered a requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spxcooling.com/library/detail/cooling-tower-fundamentals SPX Cooling Technologies MARLEY, Cooling Tower Fundamentals Page 73 (75 of 119) Column 2, Last Paragraph]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Do not operate the tower unattended.  Remote sensors and alarms may be installed to monitor tower conditions.
* Do not operate the tower without a heat load.  Basin heaters may be used to keep the water in the tower pan at an above-freezing temperature. Heat trace ("heating tape") is a resistive heating element that is installed along water pipes to prevent freezing in cold climates.
* Maintain design water flow rate over the tower fill.
* Manipulate or reduce airflow to maintain water temperature above freezing point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://spxcooling.com/pdf/H-003B.pdf |title= SPX Cooling Technologies: Operating Cooling Towers in Freezing Weather |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927151339/http://spxcooling.com/pdf/H-003B.pdf |archivedate= 27 September 2007 |df= dmy-all }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.45&amp;nbsp;MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire hazard==
Cooling towers constructed in whole or in part of combustible materials can support internal fire propagation. Such fires can become very intense, due to the high [[surface-volume ratio]] of the towers, and fires can be further intensified by natural convection or fan-assisted draft.  The resulting damage can be sufficiently severe to require the replacement of the entire cell or tower structure. For this reason, some [[model building code|code]]s and standards&lt;ref&gt;[[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA). NFPA 214, [http://www.nfpa.org/aboutthecodes/AboutTheCodes.asp?DocNum=214 ''Standard on Water-Cooling Towers''].&lt;/ref&gt; recommend that combustible cooling towers be provided with an automatic [[fire sprinkler system]]. Fires can propagate internally within the tower structure when the cell is not in operation (such as for maintenance or construction), and even while the tower is in operation, especially those of the induced-draft type, because of the existence of relatively dry areas within the towers.&lt;ref&gt;NFPA 214, [http://www.nfpa.org/aboutthecodes/AboutTheCodes.asp?DocNum=214 ''Standard on Water-Cooling Towers.''] Section A1.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural stability==
Being very large structures, cooling towers are susceptible to wind damage, and several spectacular failures have occurred in the past. At [[Ferrybridge power station]] on 1 November 1965, the station was the site of a major [[structural failure]], when three of the cooling towers collapsed owing to vibrations in {{convert|85|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} winds.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Although the structures had been built to withstand higher wind speeds, the shape of the cooling towers caused westerly winds to be funnelled into the towers themselves, creating a [[vortex]]. Three out of the original eight cooling towers were destroyed, and the remaining five were severely damaged. The towers were later rebuilt and all eight cooling towers were strengthened to tolerate adverse weather conditions. Building codes were changed to include improved structural support, and [[wind tunnel]] tests were introduced to check tower structures and configuration.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6862">[[File:Cruck framing.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cruck Framing: [[Leigh Court Barn]], [[Worcester]], England.]]
[[File:Morlanich Longhouse 2004.jpg|thumb|The [[Moirlanich Longhouse]], a byre dwelling with a cruck frame.]]
A '''cruck''' or '''crook frame''' is a curved [[lumber|timber]], one of a pair, which supports the [[roof]] of a [[building]], used particularly in [[England]]. This type of [[timber framing]] consists of long, generally naturally curved, timber members that lean inwards and form the ridge of the roof. These posts are then generally secured by a horizontal beam which then forms an "A" shape. Several of these "crooks" are constructed on the ground and then lifted into position. They are then joined together by either solid walls or cross beams which aid in preventing racking (the action of each individual frame going out of square with the rest of the frame, and thus risking collapse).

==Etymology==
The term ''crook'' or ''cruck'' comes from [[Middle English]] ''crok(e)'', from [[Old Norse]] ''krāka'', meaning "hook". This is also the origin of the word "crooked", meaning bent, twisted or deformed, and also the crook used by [[shepherd]]s and [[crosier|symbolically by bishops]].

==Use==
Crucks were chiefly in use in the [[Middle ages|medieval]] period for structures such as large [[tithe barn]]s. However, these bent timbers were comparatively rare, as they were also in high demand for the ship building industry. 

Where naturally curved timbers were convenient and available, carpenters continued to use them at much later dates. For instance, base crucks are found in the roofs of the residential range of [[Staple Inn]] Buildings, Nos. 337 – 338, [[High Holborn]], London.  This is dated by documented records to 1586, with significant alterations in 1886 (under [[Alfred Waterhouse]]) and further restorations in 1936, and 1954–55.  Despite these changes, an authority on English Historic Carpentry, Cecil Hewett, has stated that these 16th-century crucks are original.

The large main barn of the manor house [[Barlow Woodseats Hall]] features what is claimed to be the longest continuously roofed cruck barn in [[Derbyshire]], and possibly even in the United Kingdom.

An example of a Yorkshire cruck barn complete with a heather thatched roof can be found in [[Appletreewick]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.craven-cruckbarn.co.uk/cruck%20barn.htm Craven Cruck Barn]&lt;/ref&gt;  The crucks or cruck "blades" are a single oak tree riven (split) in two to form an equally shaped A frame.

Rare examples of cruck framing are found on continental Europe such as in Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nat|last=Alcock |title=The Significance of the Cruck Construction at Néchin, Belgium |work=L'architecture vernaculaire|volume=tome 34-35 (2010-2011) |url=http://www.pierreseche.com/AV_2010_alcock.htm |date=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flanders, Northern France and the [[Corrèze]] region of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lacorreze.com/documents/charpente_a_cruck.htm|title=La charpente à cruck|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No cruck frames are known to have been built in America though there are rare examples of what may be an upper cruck or knee rafters. 

==Revival==
During the current revival of green oak framing for new building work, which has occurred mainly since approximately 1980 in the UK, genuine cruck frames have quite often been included in traditionally carpentered structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are also some fine, historically authentic reconstructions.  For instance, [[Tithe Barn, Pilton]], [[Glastonbury]], whose original roof was destroyed by lightning, has been carefully rebuilt in 2005 from curved oaks.  The necessary trees were sought out, using special templates, in English woodlands.

==Types of crucks==
[[File:Cruck cottage in Wick - geograph.org.uk - 742651.jpg|thumb|Cruck cottage in Wick - geograph.org.uk - 742651|A half timbered house in [[Worcestershire]], GR SO961453, framed with a full cruck]]
# True cruck or full cruck: The blades, straight or curved, extend from a foundation near the ground to the ridge. A full cruck does not need a tie beam and may be called a "full cruck -open" or with a tie beam a "full cruck - closed".&lt;ref name="Brown66-67"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=R.

# Base cruck: The tops of the blades are truncated by the first transverse member such as by a tie beam.&lt;ref name="Brown66-67"/&gt;
# Raised cruck: The blades land on masonry wall and extend to ridge.&lt;ref name="Brown66-67"/&gt;
# Middle cruck: The blades land on masonry wall and are truncated by collar beam.&lt;ref name="Brown66-67"/&gt;
# Upper cruck: The blades land on tie beam, very similar to knee rafters.&lt;ref name="Brown66-67"/&gt; In Dutch called a kromstijlgebint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/jans353hout01_01/jans353hout01_01_0018.php |title=Houten kappen in Nederland 1000-1940 |year=1989|author=Herman Janse|language=Dutch |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apex of a cruck frame also helps to define the style and region of the cruck.  Different types include the butt apex, halved, housed, yoke, and crossed forms.&lt;ref name="Brown68"/&gt;

Standardisation of the connectors is a pre-requisite for open systems, where users expect components from different suppliers to operate together. The most widely known use of DIN 41612 connectors is in the [[VMEbus]] system.  They were also used by [[NuBus]].  The standard has subsequently been upgraded to international standards '''IEC 60603-2''' and  '''EN 60603-2'''.

DIN 41612 connectors are used in [[STEbus]],&lt;ref&gt;

and [[Europe Card Bus]],
all of which typically use male DIN 41612 connectors on [[Eurocard (printed circuit board)|Eurocard]]s plugged into female DIN 41612 on the [[backplane]] in a [[19-inch rack]] chassis.

==Mechanical details==
The standard describes connectors which may have one, two or three rows of contacts, which are labelled as rows a, b and c. Two row connectors may use rows a+b or rows a+c. The connectors may have 16 or 32 columns, which means that the possible permutations allow 16, 32, 48, 64 or 96 contacts. The rows and columns are on a 0.1&amp;nbsp;inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;mm) grid pitch. Insertion and removal force are controlled, and three durability grades are available.

Often the female DIN 41612 connectors have press fit contacts rather than solder pin contacts, to avoid thermal shock to the backplane.&lt;ref&gt;
Andrew Fletcher.
[https://books.google.com/books?id=dW4vBQAAQBAJ "Connector Industry: A Profile of the European Connector Industry"].
p. 67.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electrical details==
The headline performance of the connectors is a 2 [[ampere|amp]] per pin current carrying capacity, and 500 [[volt]] working voltage. Both these figures may need to be de-rated according to safety requirements or environmental conditions.

==Performance Classes==
The DIN 41612 specification identifies 3 different classes or "levels"; it's more complicated than this, but, essentially: class 1 is good for 500 mating cycles; class 2 is good for 400 mating cycles, and, class 3 is good for 50 mating cycles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5524">[[File: Interfone.JPG | thumb | 210px | Outdoor phone plate at the building's entrance]]
A '''door phone''' or '''door bell phone''' is a set of [[electrical]] and [[electronics|electronic]] elements used to handle two-way communication (street to home) in [[house]]s, [[apartment]]s or [[villa]]s. The device is connected to a secure communication system used to control the opening of the [[door]] giving access to any kind of [[building]]s, offices, or apartment blocks. They are so widely used in the mentioned structures, that nowadays, they form part of the standard electrical installation of most buildings.&lt;ref name = Manual&gt;[http://www.tegui.es/pdf/manuales-tecnicos/serie-300-400-500-portero/manual-tecnico-portero-introduccion-tegui.pdf Door phones reference manual]{{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest version is a simple [[intercom]] that establishes a communication between the street door and the house. In buildings where there are more than one ''door phone'' plate (located at the outside of the building's door entrance) has a certain number of buttons, depending on the number of flats existing in each building, in addition to the [[loudspeaker]].

==Operation ==
[[File: Enireja butonara pordotelefono (1536 x 1152).jpg| thumb | 210px | Modern outdoor phone plate with a push buttons matrix]]

A door phone in its most basic version is a two-way [[intercom]] allowing communication from the street to the house, with the possibility of driving an [[electric strike]] to unlock and open the door, allowing access to the interior of the building.&lt;ref name = Manual/&gt;

In places where there is more than one dwelling, the caller street, also called '' Push Plate '' or simply '' Plate Street '', is composed of a number of [[push button|button]]s is (usually one per [[housing]]) with the label next to the house or apartment number or name of the tenant.

The door phone plate is located at the outside of the entrance of each building, is composed by a matrix of [[Push-button|button]]s each of them driving a [[Buzzer]] located in a unit  inside each home, which has a button to activate the  [[electric strike]].

There are several installation systems, the most traditional of the 4 + 1, (I.E.: four wires for power, communication and door system and one for the call).

==Video door phones ==
[[File:Interphone.jpg| thumb | 210px | ''Video door phone'' indoor terminal.]]
Going a little further in time, we find [[video door phone]]s featuring a video installation apart from the classical audio.
In these cases, the intercom plate has the same structure as the previous version but features a [[Computer Monitor |video monitor]] connected to a surveillance camera that allows inspecting the person who pressed the button and part of the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asia.security.honeywell.com/pages/Category.aspx?cat=HSG-ASIASECURITY&amp;category=Video%20Door%20Phone%20System Video Door Phone System]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Access control systems'''. Some manufacturers have also adopted the possibility of opening the door  via a keyboard. By introducing a numerical secret code the [[electric strike]] is operated. Although there is also the possibility of being used as an access control with either a [[magnetic card]] or a [[smart card]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asia.security.honeywell.com/Pages/Category.aspx?category=Access%20Control&amp;cat=HSG-ASIASECURITY Access Control]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wiring topology ==
Among other classifications there is one with three different types of door phones that differ mainly in the number of wires required in their installation, having some parallelism between different manufacturers, that use different communication protocols but a similar wiring topology:
* Conventional: This system is characterized by the use of four wires plus of wires for each home. That is, (4 + "n") wires, where "n" indicates the number of homes. This system is best suited for medium-sized buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tegui.es/pdf/manuales-tecnicos/serie-300-400-500-portero/manual-tecnico-portero-convencional-4-n-tegui.pdf door phones 4+n]{{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Simplified: This system is characterized by using a wire pair, plus the number of homes in threads. That is, (1 + "n") wires,  where "n" indicates the number of homes. It is best suited for medium-sized buildings with two or three entrance gates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tegui.es/pdf/manuales-tecnicos/serie-300-400-500-portero/manual-tecnico-portero-simplificado-1-n-tegui.pdf Door phones 1+n]{{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Digital: This system more suitable for use in large buildings or complex installations, as it ensures maximum capacity and ease of installation. It is characterized for using only two wires for all facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tegui.es/pdf/manuales-tecnicos/serie-300-400-500-portero/manual-tecnico-portero-digital-2-hilos-tegui.pdf Digital door phones -2 wire]{{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
These three systems differ mainly by the number of wires required in the [[electric circuit | circuit]]. They can work with more than three terminals in parallel with the same call.
The before mentioned systems have nothing to do with the devices only with the electrical installation. Then, in addition, may include intercom monitors or other high security tools of new technology.

'''Dual-phase steel''' ('''DP steel''') is a high-strength [[steel]] that has a [[Allotropes of iron|ferritic]]–[[martensite|martensitic]] microstructure.
DP steels are produced from low or medium [[carbon steel]]s that are quenched from a temperature above A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; but below A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; determined from [[continuous cooling transformation]] diagram.
This results in a [[microstructure]] consisting of a soft ferrite matrix containing islands of martensite as the secondary phase (martensite increases the [[tensile strength]]).
Therefore, the overall behaviour of DP steels is governed by the volume fraction, morphology (size, aspect ratio, interconnectivity, etc.), the grain size and the carbon content.&lt;ref name="Abid"&gt;{{harvnb|Abid|2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
For achieving these microstructures, DP steels typically contain 0.06–0.15 wt.% C and 1.5-3% Mn (the former strengthens the martensite, and the latter causes solid solution strengthening in ferrite, while both stabilize the austenite), Cr &amp; Mo (to retard pearlite or bainite formation), Si (to promote ferrite transformation), V and Nb (for precipitation strengthening and microstructure refinement).&lt;ref name="Tasan"&gt;{{harvnb|Tasan|2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The desire to produce high strength steels with [[formability]] greater than [[microalloyed steel]] led the development of DP steels in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="chakraborti"&gt;{{harvnb|Chakraborti|Mitra|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="degarmo"&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

DP steels have high ultimate tensile strength (UTS, enabled by the martensite) combined with low initial yielding stress (provided by the ferrite phase), high early-stage strain hardening and macroscopically homogeneous plastic flow (enabled through the absence of [[Lüders band|Lüders effects]]).
These features render DP steels ideal materials for automotive-related sheet forming operations. 

The steel melt is produced in an [[oxygen]] top blowing process in the converter, and undergoes an alloy treatment in the secondary metallurgy phase. The product is [[aluminium]]-[[killed steel]], with high tensile strength achieved by the composition with [[manganese]], [[chromium]] and [[silicon]].

Their advantages are as follows:&lt;ref name="chakraborti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fallahi"&gt;{{harvnb|Fallahi|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Low [[yield strength]]
*Low yield to tensile strength ratio (yield strength / [[tensile strength]] = 0.5)
*High initial strain hardening rates
*Good uniform elongation
*A high strain rate sensitivity (the faster it is crushed the more energy it absorbs)&lt;ref name="degarmo"/&gt;
*Good fatigue resistance

Due to these properties DP steels are often used for automotive [[body panel]]s, wheels, and [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]].&lt;ref name="fallahi"/&gt;

'''Döbereiner's lamp''', also called a "tinderbox" ("Feuerzeug"), is a [[lighter]] invented in 1823 by the [[Germany|German]] [[Chemistry|chemist]] [[Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner]]; the lighter is based on the [[Johannes Fürstenberg|Fürstenberger]] lighter and was in production until ca. 1880. In the jar, similar to the [[Kipp's apparatus]], [[zinc]] metal reacts with dilute [[sulfuric acid]] to produce [[hydrogen]] gas. When a valve is opened, a jet of hydrogen is released onto a [[platinum sponge]]. The sponge catalyzes a reaction with atmospheric oxygen, which heats the catalyst and ignites the hydrogen, producing a gentle flame.

[[File:Döbereiner fire gadget.png|thumb|upright|left|{{ubl|a. glass cylinder|b. open bottle |c. wire |d. zinc |e. stopcock |f. nozzle |g. platinum sponge}}]]
It was commercialized for lighting fires and pipes. It's said that in 1820s over a million of the "tinderboxes" were sold.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite book

It is a mixture of ammonium salts of cresol, phenol and various nitrocresols and nitrophenols principally trinitrocresol and picric acid. It was invented in 1888-1889 by Siersch and Kubin, and used in [[Austria-Hungary]] to load [[artillery shell]]s.

Ecrasite is prepared by the partial nitration of  a crude mixture of cresol and phenol with a mixture of concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids and the neutralisation of the product with ammonia to produce a crude salt similar to ammonium picrate.

Ecrasite is a bright yellow solid. It is waxy to touch and melts at about 100 °C. When subjected to open flame, it burns without detonation, unless confined. It is insensitive to friction. It requires a [[detonator]] for initiation. Its general adoption was hindered by several unexplained explosions during loading into shells, which might have been caused by creation of unstable metal salts of trinitrocresol and/or trinitrophenol when the explosive came in contact with metals or alloys such as copper, brass (widely used for manufacturing detonator parts) and possibly other ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15308 Nitro-Explosives: A Practical Treatise by P.

[[File:Open fireplace with icon.jpg|thumb|Modern open fireplace]]
A '''fireplace''' is a structure made of brick, stone or metal designed to contain a fire. Fireplaces are used for the relaxing ambiance they create and for heating a room. Modern fireplaces vary in heat efficiency, depending on the design.

Historically they were used for heating a dwelling, cooking, and heating water for laundry and domestic uses. A fire is contained in a [[Firebox (architecture)|firebox]] or firepit; a [[chimney]] or other [[flue]] allows exhaust to escape. A fireplace may have the following: a foundation, a [[hearth]], a [[Firebox (architecture)|firebox]], a [[fireplace mantel|mantelpiece]]; a [[chimney crane]] (used in kitchen and laundry fireplaces), a grate, a [[lintel]], a lintel bar,home [[overmantel]], a [[Damper (architecture)|damper]], a smoke chamber, a throat, and a [[flue]].

On the exterior there is often a corbeled brick crown, in which the projecting courses of brick act as a drip course to keep rainwater from running down the exterior walls. A cap, hood, or shroud serves to keep rainwater out of the exterior of the chimney; rain in the chimney is a much greater problem in chimneys lined with impervious flue tiles or metal liners than with the traditional [[masonry]] chimney, which soaks up all but the most violent rain. Some chimneys have a [[spark arrestor]] incorporated into the crown or cap.

Organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Washington Department of Ecology warn that, according to various studies, [[#Health effects|fireplaces can pose a significant health risk]].&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/burnwise/healtheffects.html|title=Health Effects - Burn Wise - US EPA|work=epa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ecology/&gt; The EPA writes "[[Smoke]] may smell good, but it's not good for you."&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt;

==Types of fireplaces==
* Manufactured fireplaces are made with sheet metal or glass fire boxes.
* [[Electric fireplace]]s can be built-in replacements for wood or gas or retrofit with log inserts or electric fireboxes.
* [https://www.tweedsmag.org/electric-fireplace-reviews/ A few types] are, wall mounted electric fireplaces, electric fireplace stoves, electric mantel fireplaces and fixed or free standing electric fireplaces.


Masonry and prefabricated fireplaces can be fueled by [[wood]], [[natural gas]], [[biomass]] and [[propane]] fuel sources. Ventless Fireplaces (duct free/room-venting fireplaces) are fueled by either gel, liquid propane, bottled gas or natural gas. In the United States, some states and local counties have laws restricting these types of fireplaces. They must be properly sized to the area to be heated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ventlessfireplacereview.com/2015/11/06/best-ventless-fireplace-logs-review/|title=Best Ventless Fireplace Logs Review|date=2015-11-06|website=Ventless Fireplace Review|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also air quality control issues due to the amount of moisture they release into the room air, and oxygen sensor and carbon monoxide sensors are safety essentials.  [[Direct vent fireplace]]s are fueled by either liquid propane or natural gas.  They are completely sealed from the area that is heated, and vent all exhaust gasses to the exterior of the structure.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Chimney and flue types:
* [[Masonry]] (brick or stone fireplaces and chimneys) with or without tile-lined flue.
* [[Reinforced concrete]] chimneys. Fundamental design flaws bankrupted the US manufacturers and made the design obsolete. These chimneys often show vertical cracks on the exterior.
* Metal-lined flue: Double or triple walled metal pipe running up inside a new or existing wood-framed or masonry chase.

Newly constructed flues may feature a chase cover, a cap, and a spark arrestor at the top to keep small animals out and to prevent sparks from being broadcast into the atmosphere. All fireplaces require trained gas service members to carry out installations.

===Accessories===
A wide range of accessories are used with fireplaces, which range between countries, regions, and historical periods. For the interior, common in recent Western cultures include grates, [[fireguard]]s, log boxes, [[andiron]]s, pellet baskets, and [[fire dog]]s, all of which cradle fuel and accelerate burning. A grate (or fire grate) is a frame, usually of [[iron]] bars, to retain [[fuel]] for a [[fire]]. Heavy metal [[Fireplace fireback|fireback]]s are sometimes used to capture and re-radiate heat, to protect the back of the fireplace, and as decoration. Fenders are low metal frames set in front of the fireplace to contain embers, soot and ash. For fireplace tending, tools include [[Fireplace poker|poker]]s, [[bellows]], [[tongs]], shovels, brushes and tool stands. Other wider accessories can include log baskets, companion sets, coal buckets, cabinet accessories and more. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.evansfireplaces.com/|title=Fireplaces Leicester Accessories|last=Jonathan|first=Admin|date=|website=Evans Fireplace Centre|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Kochen über offenem Feuer.JPG|thumb|Cooking over a fireplace]]
Ancient fire pits were sometimes built in the ground, within caves, or in the center of a hut or dwelling. Evidence of prehistoric, man-made fires exists on all five inhabited continents. The disadvantage of early indoor fire pits was that they produced toxic and/or irritating smoke inside the dwelling.

Fire pits developed into raised [[hearth]]s in buildings, but venting smoke depended on open windows or holes in roofs. The medieval [[great hall]] typically had a centrally located hearth, where an open fire burned with the smoke rising to the vent in the roof. [[Louver]]s were developed during the Middle Ages to allow the roof vents to be covered so rain and snow would not enter.

Also during the Middle Ages, [[Smoke canopy|smoke canopies]] were invented to prevent smoke from spreading through a room and vent it out through a wall or roof. These could be placed against stone walls, instead of taking up the middle of the room, and this allowed smaller rooms to be heated.

[[Chimney]]s were invented in northern Europe in the 11th or 12th centuries and largely fixed the problem of fumes, more reliably venting smoke outside. They made it possible to give the fireplace a draft, and also made it possible to put fireplaces in multiple rooms in buildings conveniently. They did not come into general use immediately, however, as they were expensive to build and maintain.

In 1678 [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]], nephew of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], raised the grate of the fireplace, improving the airflow and venting system. The 18th century saw two important developments in the history of fireplaces. [[Benjamin Franklin]] developed a [[Franklin fireplace|convection chamber for the fireplace]] that greatly improved the efficiency of fireplaces and wood stoves. He also improved the airflow by pulling air from a basement and venting out a longer area at the top. In the later 18th century, [[Count Rumford]] designed a fireplace with a tall, shallow firebox that was better at drawing the smoke up and out of the building. The shallow design also improved greatly the amount of radiant heat projected into the room. Rumford's design is the foundation for modern fireplaces.

The Aesthetic movement of the 1870s and 1880s took on a more traditional spectra based on stone and deflected unnecessary ornamentation. Rather it relied on simple designs with little unnecessary ornamentation. In the 1890s the Aesthetic movement gave way to the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] movement, where the emphasis was still placed on providing quality stone. Stone fireplaces at this time were a symbol of prosperity, which to some degree is still the notion today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firecraft.co.uk/|title=Traditional Stone Fireplaces|last=Admin|first=Charlie|date=|website=Stone Fireplaces|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Evolution of fireplace design===
[[File:Sherlock Holmes Museum 001.jpg|thumb|[[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian style]] "sitting room" with a fireplace in the [[Sherlock Holmes Museum]], London]]
Over time, the purpose of fireplaces has changed from one of necessity to one of visual interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zxORCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA627&amp;dq=Over+time+the+design+of+fireplaces+has+changed+from+one+of+necessity+to+one+of+visual+interest&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS86ra0uvUAhXkzFQKHfe2DDoQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Over%20time%20the%20design%20of%20fireplaces%20has%20changed%20from%20one%20of%20necessity%20to%20one%20of%20visual%20interest&amp;f=false|title=Architectural Graphic Standards|last=Architects|first=American Institute of|date=2016-03-21|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118909508|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early ones were more fire pits than modern fireplaces. They were used for warmth on cold days and nights, as well as for cooking. They also served as a gathering place within the home. These fire pits were usually centered within a room, allowing more people to gather around it.

Many flaws were found in early fireplace designs. Along with the Industrial Revolution, came large scale housing developments, necessitating a standardization of fireplaces. The most renowned fireplace designers of this time were the Adam Brothers. They perfected a style of fireplace design that was used for generations. It was smaller, more brightly lit, with an emphasis on the quality of the materials used in their construction, instead of their size.

By the 1800s most new fireplaces were made up of two parts, the surround and the insert. The surround consisted of the mantlepiece and sides supports, usually in wood, marble or granite. The insert was where the fire burned, and was constructed of cast iron often backed with decorative [[tiles]]. As well as providing heat, the fireplaces of the [[Victorian era]] were thought to add a cozy ambiance to homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fireplaceantiques.co.uk/Category/history-of-the-antique-fireplace/865|title=History of the Antique Fireplace|work=fireplaceantiques.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heating efficiency==
[[File:2 row grate heater with ash tray.jpg|thumb|right|Fireplace with tubular [[grate heater]], with a high surface area in its heat exchanger and a lift out ash tray to simplify cleanup]]
Some fireplace units incorporate a blower which transfers more of the fireplace's heat to the air via convection, resulting in a more evenly heated space and a lower heating load. Fireplace efficiency can also be increased with the use of a fireback, a piece of metal that sits behind the fire and reflects heat back into the room. Firebacks are traditionally made from cast iron, but are also made from stainless steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Steps to a More Efficient Fireplace|url=http://fireplacemall.com/blog/2012/three-steps-to-a-more-efficient-fireplace/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficiency is a complicated concept though with open hearth fireplaces. Most efficiency tests consider just the effect of heating of the air. An open fireplace is not, and never was, intended to heat the air. A fireplace with a fireback is a radiant heater, and has done so since the 15th century. The best way to gauge the output of a fireplace is if you notice you're turning the thermostat up or down.

Most older fireplaces have a relatively low efficiency rating.  Standard, modern, wood-burning [[masonry heater|masonry fireplaces]] though have an efficiency rating of at least 80% (legal minimum requirement for example in Salzburg/Austria).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=LrSbg&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20000675|title=RIS - Gesamte Rechtsvorschrift für Heizungsanlagen-Verordnung 2010 - Landesrecht Salzburg, Fassung vom 18.07.2015|work=bka.gv.at}}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve efficiency,  fireplaces can also be modified by inserting special heavy fireboxes designed to burn much cleaner and can reach efficiencies as high as 80% in heating the air.  These modified fireplaces are often equipped with a large fire window, enabling an efficient heating process in two phases. During the first phase the initial heat is provided through a large glass window while the fire is burning. During this time the structure, built of refractory bricks, absorbs the heat. This heat is then evenly radiated for many hours during the second phase. Masonry fireplaces without a glass fire window only provide heat radiated from its surface. Depending on outside temperatures 1 to 2 daily firings are sufficient to ensure a constant room temperature.

==Health effects==
In a literature review published in the journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, J.T. Zelikoff concludes that there are a wide variety of health risks posed by residential wood combustion. She writes:
{{Cquote|With regard to adults, studies show that prolonged inhalation of [[wood smoke]] contributed to [[chronic bronchitis]], chronic interstitial [[lung disease]], [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]] and [[corpulmonale]], and altered pulmonary immune defense mechanisms. While adverse effects on adults are notable, children appear to be at greatest risk. Many studies that focused specifically on RWC [''Residential Wood Combustion''] have concluded that young children living in homes heated by a wood-burning stove had a greater occurrence of moderate and severe chronic respiratory symptoms than children of the same age and sex who did not live in homes heated with a wood burning stove. Exposure of preschool children living in homes heated with wood burning stoves or in houses with open fireplaces yielded these effects: decreased pulmonary [[lung]] function in young [[asthmatics]]; increased incidence of acute [[bronchitis]] and severity/frequency of [[wheezing]] and [[coughing]]; and increased incidence, duration, and possibly severity of acute [[respiratory infections]].

Residential wood combustion [[Exhaust gas|emissions]] also contain [[Lower sulfur oxides|sulfur oxides]], [[nitrogen oxides]], [[carbon monoxide]] and potentially [[carcinogenic]] compounds including [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]], [[benzene]], [[formaldehyde]] and [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]]. Some of these pollutants are known to cause cancer but their effects on human health via exposure to wood smoke have not been extensively studied.&lt;ref&gt;Zelikoff, J.T., 2002. The Toxicology of Inhaled Woodsmoke. Journal of Toxicology &amp; Environmental
Health, Part B, 5:269-282&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The [[Washington Department of Ecology]] also published a booklet explaining why wood smoke can be dangerous. It explains that human lung and respiratory systems are unable to filter particles emitted by wood combustion, which penetrate deeply into the lungs. For months, cancer causing chemicals can continue to cause changes and structural damage within the respiratory system. Young children, seniors, pregnant women, smokers and individuals with respiratory disorders are most vulnerable. Wood smoke can cause disease and even death in children because it is associated with [[lower respiratory tract infection]]s.&lt;ref name=Ecology&gt;[http://www.ecy.wa.gov/pubs/92046.pdf Washington's Department of Ecology, "Health Effects of Wood Smoke", 1997, Retrieved February 3 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Home fireplaces have caused fatal [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/derek-kehler-and-helena-curic-identified-as-young-couple-killed-in-kurrajong-cabin-20150609-ghk7yb.html|title=Derek Kehler and Helena Curic identified as young couple killed in Kurrajong cabin|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aircraft with [[fly-by-wire]] flight controls require computer-controlled '''flight control modes''' that are capable of determining the operational mode (computational law) of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="urlCrossing the Skies » Fly-by-wire and Airbus Laws"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crossingtheskies.com/fly-by-wire-airbus-laws/ |title=Crossing the Skies » Fly-by-wire and Airbus Laws |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boeing 777"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://euler.ecs.umass.edu/ece655/Boeing777.ppt |title=The Boeing 777 |format=powerpoint  |work= by Saurabh  Chheda |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reduction of electronic flight control can be caused by the failure of a computational device, such as the flight control computer or an information providing device, such as the [[ADIRU]].&lt;ref name="Skybrary: Flight Control Laws"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Flight_Control_Laws |title=Skybrary: Flight Control Laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aircraft flight control systems|Electronic flight control systems]] (EFCS) also provide augmentation in normal flight, such as increased protection of the aircraft from overstress or providing a more comfortable flight for passengers by recognizing and correcting for [[turbulence]] and providing [[yaw damper|yaw damping]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Two aircraft manufacturers produce commercial passenger aircraft with primary flight computers that can perform under different flight control modes (or laws). The most well-known are the ''normal'', ''alternate'', ''direct'' and ''mechanical laws'' of the [[Airbus]] [[Airbus A320 family|A320]]-[[Airbus A380|A380]].&lt;ref name="urlCrossing the Skies » Fly-by-wire and Airbus Laws"/&gt;

These newer aircraft use electronic control systems to increase safety and performance while saving aircraft weight. These electronic systems are lighter than the old mechanical systems and can also protect the aircraft from overstress situations, allowing designers to reduce over-engineered components, which further reduces the aircraft's weight.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Flight control laws (Airbus)==
[[File:Gulfair.a330-200.a40-kc.arp.jpg|thumb|right|A330-200 in flight]]

Airbus aircraft designs after the [[Airbus A300|A300]]/[[Airbus A310|A310]] are almost completely controlled by fly-by-wire equipment. These newer aircraft, including the [[Airbus A320 family|A320]], [[Airbus A330|A330]], [[Airbus A340|A340]], [[Airbus A350|A350]] and [[Airbus A380|A380]] operate under Airbus flight control laws.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartcockpit.com/pdf/plane/airbus/A330/systems/0010/ |title=Airbus 330 – Systems – Flight Controls |format= |work=SmartCockpit – Airline training guides, Aviation, Operations, Safety |accessdate=July 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090612084314/http://www.smartcockpit.com/pdf/plane/airbus/A330/systems/0010/ |archivedate=June 12, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The flight controls on the Airbus A330, for example, are all electronically controlled and hydraulically activated. Some surfaces, such as the rudder, can also be mechanically controlled. In normal flight, the computers act to prevent excessive forces in pitch and roll.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt;[[File:Fly by wire A321 cockpit.jpg|thumb|left|Airbus A321 Cockpit]] 
[[File:Airspeed indication system - fly by wire.png|thumb|Illustration of the Air-data reference system on Airbus A330]]

The aircraft is controlled by three primary control computers (captain's, first officer's, and standby) and two secondary control computers (captain's and first officer's). In addition there are two flight control data computers (FCDC) that read information from the sensors, such as air data (airspeed, altitude). This is fed along with GPS data, into three [[redundancy (engineering)|redundant]] processing units known as [[air data inertial reference unit]]s (ADIRUs) that act both as an air data reference and inertial reference. ADIRUs are part of the air data inertial reference system, which, on the Airbus is linked to eight [[air data module]]s: three are linked to [[pitot tubes]] and five are linked to static sources. Information from the ADIRU is fed into one of several flight control computers (primary and secondary flight control). The computers also receive information from the control surfaces of the aircraft and from the pilots aircraft control devices and autopilot. Information from these computers is sent both to the  pilot's primary flight display and also to the control surfaces.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

There are four named flight control laws, however ''alternate law'' consists of two modes, ''alternate law 1'' and ''alternate law 2''. Each of these modes have different sub modes: ground mode, flight mode and flare, plus a back-up ''mechanical law''.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt;

===Normal law===
''Normal law'' differs depending on the stage of flight. These include:{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

*Stationary at the gate
*Taxiing from the gate to a runway or from a runway back to the gate
*Beginning the take-off roll
*Initial climb
*Cruise climb and cruise flight at altitude
*Final descent, flare and landing.

During the transition from take-off to cruise there is a 5-second transition, from descent to flare there is a two-second transition, and from flare to ground there is another 2 second transition in ''normal law''.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt;

====Ground mode====
The aircraft behaves as in direct mode: the autotrim feature is turned off and there is a direct response of the elevators to the sidestick inputs. The horizontal stabilizer is set to 4° up &lt;!-- Stab nose up? Clarify--&gt; but manual settings &lt;!-- Manual settings, keyed in to the FMS? Clarify --&gt;(e.g. for center of gravity) override this setting. After the wheels leave the ground, a 5-second transition occurs where ''normal law – flight mode'' takes over from ''ground mode''.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt;

====Flight mode====
The flight mode of ''normal law'' provides five types of protection: pitch attitude, load factor limitations, high speed, high-[[angle of attack|AOA]] and [[bank angle]]. ''Flight mode'' is operational from take-off, until shortly before the aircraft lands, around 100 feet above ground level. It can be lost prematurely as a result of pilot commands or system failures. Loss of ''normal law'' as a result of a system failure results in ''alternate law 1'' or ''2''.&lt;ref name="urlAirbus Flight Control Laws"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airbusdriver.net/airbus_fltlaws.htm |title=Airbus Flight Control Laws |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike conventional controls, in ''normal law'' vertical side stick movement corresponds to a load factor proportional to stick deflection independent of aircraft speed. When the stick is neutral and the load factor is 1g, the aircraft remains in level flight without the pilot changing the elevator trim. Horizontal side stick movement commands a roll rate, and the aircraft maintains a proper pitch angle once a turn has been established, up to 33° bank. The system prevents further trim up when the angle of attack is excessive, the load factor exceeds 1.3g, or when the bank angle exceeds 33°.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Alpha protection (α-Prot) prevents stalling and guards against the effects of windshear. The protection engages when the angle of attack is between α-Prot and α-Max and limits the angle of attack commanded by the pilot's sidestick or, if autopilot is engaged, it disengages the autopilot.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}
 
High speed protection will automatically recover from an overspeed. There are two speed limitations for high altitude aircraft, V&lt;sub&gt;MO&lt;/sub&gt; (maximum operational velocity) and M&lt;sub&gt;MO&lt;/sub&gt; (maximum operational Mach) the two speeds are the same at approximately 31,000 feet, below which overspeed is determined by V&lt;sub&gt;MO&lt;/sub&gt; and above which by M&lt;sub&gt;MO&lt;/sub&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

====Flare mode====
[[File:Airbus A380.jpg|thumb|right|A380 in take off]]
This mode is automatically engaged when the [[radar altimeter]] indicates 100 feet above ground. At 50 feet the aircraft trims the nose slightly down. During the flare, ''normal law'' provides high-[[angle of attack|AOA]] protection and bank angle protection. The load factor is permitted to be from 2.5g to −1g, or 2.0g to 0g when slats are extended. Pitch attitude is limited from −15° to +30°, and upper limit is further reduced to +25° as the aircraft slows.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt;

===Alternate law===
There are four reconfiguration modes for the Airbus fly-by-wire aircraft: ''alternate law 1'', ''alternate law 2'', ''direct law'' and ''mechanical law''. The ground mode and flare modes for ''alternate law'' are identical to those modes for ''normal law''.

'''Alternate law 1''' (ALT1)  mode combines a ''normal law'' lateral mode with the load factor, bank angle protections retained. High angle of attack protection may be lost and low energy (level flight stall) protection is lost. High speed and high angle of attack protections enter alternative law mode.&lt;ref name="urlAirbus Flight Control Laws"/&gt;

ALT1 may be entered if there are faults in the horizontal stabilizer, an elevator, yaw-damper actuation, slat or flap sensor, or a single air data reference fault.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt;

'''Alternate law 2''' (ALT2) loses ''normal law'' lateral mode (replaced by roll direct mode and yaw alternate mode) along with pitch attitude protection, bank angle protection and low energy protection. Load factor protection is retained. High angle of attack and high speed protections are retained unless the reason for ''alternate law 2'' mode is the failure of two air-data references or if the two remaining air data references disagree.&lt;ref name="urlAirbus Flight Control Laws"/&gt;

ALT2 mode is entered when 2 engines flame out (on dual engine aircraft), faults in two inertial or air-data references, with the autopilot being lost, except with an ADR disagreement. This mode may also be entered with an all spoilers fault, certain ailerons fault, or pedal transducers fault.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt;

===Direct law===
''Direct law'' (DIR) introduces a direct stick-to-control surfaces relationship:&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt; control surface motion is directly related to the sidestick and rudder pedal motion.&lt;ref name="urlCrossing the Skies » Fly-by-wire and Airbus Laws"/&gt; The trimmable horizontal stabilizer can only be controlled by the manual trim wheel. All protections are lost, and the maximum deflection of the elevators is limited for each configuration as a function of the current aircraft centre of gravity. This aims to create a compromise between adequate pitch control with a forward C.G. and not-too-sensitive control with an aft C.G.&lt;ref name="A320AFM"&gt;Airbus A320 AFM (requires page number, publisher, etc)&lt;/ref&gt;

DIR is entered if there is failure of three inertial reference units or the primary flight computers, faults in two elevators, or flame-out in two engines (on a two-engine aircraft) when the captain's primary flight computer is also inoperable.&lt;ref name="SmartCockpit - A330 Flight Controls"/&gt;

===Mechanical law===
In the ''mechanical law'' back-up mode, pitch is controlled by the mechanical trim system and lateral direction is controlled by the rudder pedals operating the rudder mechanically.&lt;ref name="urlCrossing the Skies » Fly-by-wire and Airbus Laws"/&gt;

==Boeing 777 Primary Flight Control System==
[[File:Boeing 777-200ER cockpit.jpg|thumb|right|The cockpit of the 777 is similar to 747-400, a fly-by-wire control simulating mechanical control]]
The fly-by-wire electronic flight control system of the Boeing 777 differs from the Airbus EFCS. The design principle is to provide a system that responds similarly to a mechanically controlled system.&lt;ref name="Boeing B-777: Fly-By-Wire Flight Controls"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davi.ws/avionics/TheAvionicsHandbook_Cap_11.pdf |title=11 Boeing B-777: Fly-By-Wire Flight Controls |format=pdf | author=Gregg F. Bartley – Boeing | date=May 4, 2008 | accessdate=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the system is controlled electronically the flight control system can provide [[flight envelope]] protection.

The electronic system is subdivided between 2 levels, the 4 actuator control electronics (ACE) and the 3 primary flight computers (PFC). The ACEs control actuators (from those on pilot controls to control surface controls and the PFC). The role of the PFC is to calculate the control laws and provide feedback forces, pilot information and warnings.&lt;ref name="Boeing B-777: Fly-By-Wire Flight Controls"/&gt;

===Standard protections and augmentations===
The flight control system on the 777 is designed to restrict control authority beyond certain range by increasing the back pressure once the desired limit is reached. This is done via electronically controlled [[backdrive]] actuators (controlled by ACE). The protections and augmentations are: bank angle protection, turn compensation, stall protection, over-speed protection, pitch control, stability augmentation and thrust asymmetry compensation. The design philosophy is: "to inform the pilot that the command being given would put the aircraft outside of its normal operating envelope, but the ability to do so is not precluded."&lt;ref name="Boeing B-777: Fly-By-Wire Flight Controls"/&gt;

===Normal mode===
In ''normal mode'' the PFCs transmit actuator commands to the ACEs, which convert them into analog servo commands. Full functionality is provided, including all enhanced performance, envelope protection and ride quality features.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Secondary mode===
Boeing ''secondary mode'' is comparable to the Airbus ''alternate law'', with the PFCs supplying commands to the ACEs. However, EFCS functionality is reduced, including loss of flight envelope protection. Like the Airbus system, this state is entered when a number of failures occur in the EFCS or interfacing systems (e.g. ADIRU or [[SAARU]]).&lt;ref name="Boeing 777"/&gt;

'''Heinz Faßmann''' (born August 13, 1955 in [[Düsseldorf]]) is an [[Austria]]n politician and [[professor]] of [[human geography]] and [[land-use planning]] at the [[University of Vienna]]. Since December 2017, Faßmann has been serving as the [[Ministry of Education (Austria)|minister of education]] in the [[Kurz government|Kurz cabinet]]. Faßmann is considered to be aligned with the [[Austrian People's Party]] but holds no formal party membership or affiliation.
 
== Early life ==

Heinz Faßmann was born on August 13, 1955 in [[Düsseldorf]], [[Germany]].

He spent his childhood and adolescence in [[Vienna]].

Faßmann attended primary school from 1962 to 1966 and [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] from 1966 to 1974.&lt;ref name="parlcv"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.parlament.gv.at/WWER/PAD_02975/index.shtml | title = Dr. Heinz Faßmann | website = Austrian Parliament | accessdate = 2018-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Faßmann studied [[geography]] and [[economic history|social and economic history]] at the [[University of Vienna]], graduating with a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="ma"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.meineabgeordneten.at/Abgeordnete/Heinz.Fassmann | title = Univ.-Prof. Dr. Heinz Faßmann | website = Meine Abgeordneten | accessdate = 2018-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1980 to 1981,&lt;ref name="parlcv"/&gt; he was engaged in postgraduate work in [[sociology]] at the [[Institute for Advanced Studies (Vienna)|Institute for Advanced Studies]].&lt;ref name="unicv"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://raumforschung.univie.ac.at/team/fassmann-heinz/ | title = Heinz Faßmann, Univ. Prof. Dr. | website = University of Vienna | accessdate = 2018-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1981 to 1992, Faßmann was a researcher with the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]]. He spent his academy years on the academy's commission on land-use planning ({{lang|de|Kommission für Raumforschung}}). On the strength of his commission work, he was appointed director of the Institute of City and Regional Planning ({{lang|de|Institut für Stadt- und Regionalforschung}}) in 1992.&lt;ref name="parlcv"/&gt;

Four years later, in 1996, Faßmann left Vienna and the academy to become a C4 professor of human geography and geoinformatics at the [[Technical University of Munich]].
Another four years later, in 2000, Faßmann returned to Vienna to teach human geography and land-use planning at his alma mater. In 2011, he was made the university's [[prorector|vice rector]], a post he held until his transition into politics in 2017.&lt;ref name="parlcv"/&gt;
He also served as a member of the [[Academic Senate|senate]] of the University of Vienna from 2000 to 2006 and as the [[dean (education)|dean]] of the Faculty of Geosciences from 2006 to 2011.&lt;ref name="unicv"/&gt;

In addition to his academic work, Faßmann held positions on various committees and sat on the [[supervisory board]]s of a number of companies, including one [[university spin-off]] incubator.
Faßmann ran a spin-off of his own, the Heinz Faßmann Projektentwicklung KG, from 2013 to 2018.&lt;ref name="ma"/&gt;
He was director of the Expert Commission of German Foundations on Integration and Migration ({{lang|de|Sachverständigenrat deutscher Stiftungen für Integration und Migration}}) from 2009 to 2017.&lt;ref name="rektorcv"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171216082943/https://rektorat.univie.ac.at/rektorat/vizerektorinnen/vizerektor-fassmann/lebenslauf/ | archivedate = December 16, 2017 | url = https://rektorat.univie.ac.at/rektorat/vizerektorinnen/vizerektor-fassmann/lebenslauf/ | accessdate = 2018-05-10 | title = Vizerektor Faßmann | website = University of Vienna }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006 he was, for the second time, appointed Director of the Institute of City and Regional Planning.&lt;ref name="ma"/&gt;

Faßmann routinely acted as a political consultant and advisor to the Austrian government. He became chairman of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Austria)|Ministry of Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs]] Expert Commission on Integration ({{lang|de|Expertenrat für Integration}}) in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | website = Ministry of Foreign Affairs | url = https://www.bmeia.gv.at/integration/expertenrat/ | title = Expertenrat – BMEIA, Außenministerium Österreich | accessdate = 2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has been sitting on the [[Ministry of the Interior (Austria)|Ministry of the Interior]] Migration Council for Austria ({{lang|de|Migrationsrat für Österreich}}),
later renamed Migration Commission ({{lang|de|Migrationskommission}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171226073901/https://www.oeaw.ac.at/isr/team/direktion/heinz-fassmann/ | archivedate = 2017-12-26 | url = https://www.oeaw.ac.at/isr/team/direktion/heinz-fassmann/ | title = Heinz Fassmann |accessdate = 2018-05-10| website = OEAW}}&lt;/ref&gt;
since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bmi.gv.at/cms/bmi/_news/bmi.aspx?id=5458593070466150436C303D&amp;view=1 |title = Aktuelles &amp; News | accessdate = 2016-12-15 | website = Ministry of the Interior}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Sterkl | first = Maria | title = Österreich braucht Migration | website = [[Der Standard]] | date = December 15, 2017 | url = http://derstandard.at/2000049319486/Innenminister-Oesterreich-braucht-Migration | accessdate = 2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Faßmann had never held elected office and never officially attached himself to any political party, he was invited to join the [[Kurz government|Kurz cabinet]] as the [[Ministry of Education (Austria)|minister of education]].
When the cabinet took office on December 18, 2017, Faßmann was appointed [[Ministry of Education (Austria)|minister of education and science]]. Following a reshuffling of ministerial responsibilities − a move regularly made by new parliamentary majority leaders − he became [[Ministry of Education (Austria)|minister of education, science and research]] on January 8, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://diepresse.com/home/innenpolitik/5349890/Acht-Minister-erneut-angelobt | title = Acht Minister erneut angelobt | website = [[Die Presse]] | date = January 8, 2018 | accessdate = 2018-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Faßmann has resigned his positions as a vice rector, as the chairman of the commission, and as a member of the council. For the duration of his term in cabinet office, he has also suspended his position as the director of the Institute of City and Regional Planning.

== Personal life ==

Born a German, Heinz Faßmann has been a naturalized Austrian citizen since 1994.

He is married and has two children.

Faßmann stands well over two meters tall. Correcting media reports that erroneously cited even greater numbers, Faßmann states his height at 203&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.krone.at/1599090 | date = December 23, 2017 | website = [[Kronen Zeitung]] | title = Minster Faßmann: Übernehmen Sie ein Himmelfahrtskommando? | accessdate = 2018-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NIH-lancearm2.jpg|thumb|right|Lance Armstrong]]
For much of the second phase of his career, American [[cyclist]] [[Lance Armstrong]] faced constant allegations of [[Doping in sport|doping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/index-of-lance-armstrong-doping-allegations-over-the-years|title=Index of Lance Armstrong doping allegations over the years|first=Laura|last=Weislo|date=August 23, 2012|accessdate=August 24, 2012|work=Cyclingnews|publisher=Future Publishing Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong consistently denied allegations of using [[performance enhancing drugs]] until a partial confession during a broadcast interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]] in January 2013.

==Background==
{{quote|If you consider my situation: a guy who comes back from arguably, you know, a death sentence [''i.e.'', Armstrong's 1996 cancer diagnosis and treatment], why would I then enter into a sport and dope myself up and risk my life again?

Armstrong has been criticized for his disagreements with outspoken opponents of [[Doping in sport|doping]] such as journalist [[Paul Kimmage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/cycling/article4232249.ece |work=The Times | location=London | title=Countdown to the Tour de France Jonathan Vaughters and his drugsfree team | first=Paul | last=Kimmage | date=June 29, 2008 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/paul_kimmage/article2159415.ece |work=The Times | location=London | title=They bust the addicts but the dealers ride on | first=Paul | last=Kimmage | date=July 29, 2007 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cyclist [[Christophe Bassons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article451832.ece |work=The Times | location=London | title=Armstrong rounds on critics over drugs storm | first=Jeremy | last=Whittle | date=July 1, 2004 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article5750574.ece |work=The Times | location=London | title=World in motion cycling divided by Paul Kimmage and Lance Armstrongs cancer row | date=February 17, 2009 | accessdate=May 7, 2010 | first=Owen | last=Slot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bassons wrote a number of articles for a French newspaper during the [[1999 Tour de France]] which made references to doping in the [[peloton]]. Subsequently, Armstrong had an altercation with Bassons during that Tour where Bassons said he rode up alongside on the [[Alpe d'Huez]] stage to tell him "it was a mistake to speak out the way I do and [Armstrong] asked why I was doing it. I told him that I'm thinking of the next generation of riders. Then he said 'Why don't you leave, then?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanite.fr/node/379945 |title=Le coup de blues de Christophe Bassons&amp;nbsp;– l'Humanite |publisher=Humanite.fr |date=July 17, 1999 |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong later confirmed Bassons's story. On the main evening news on [[TF1]], a French television station, Armstrong said: "His accusations aren't good for cycling, for his team, for me, for anybody. If he thinks cycling works like that, he's wrong and he would be better off going home."&lt;ref&gt;Cited, ''L'Équipe'', July 17, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kimmage, a professional cyclist in the 1980s who later became a sports journalist, referred to Armstrong as a "[[cancer]] in cycling".&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/&gt; He also asked Armstrong questions in relation to his "admiration for dopers" at a press conference at the [[Tour of California]] in 2009, provoking a scathing reaction from Armstrong.&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/&gt; This spat continued and is exemplified by Kimmage's articles in the British newspaper ''[[The Sunday Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmage, Paul.

From his return to cycling in the fall of 2008 through March 2009, Armstrong submitted to twenty-four unannounced drug tests by various anti-doping authorities. All of the tests were negative for performance-enhancing drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Albergotti | first = Reed | title = Lance to Drug Tester: Your Papers, Please | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date = April 8, 2009 | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123915747307299985 | postscript =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Armstrong outraged by French misbehaviour claims | agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] | date = April 7, 2009 | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gpWQTJmkqpByIaAMzL_-ZAO8qiKg | accessdate =September 28, 2009 | postscript =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. federal prosecutors pursued allegations of doping by Armstrong from 2010–2012. The effort convened a [[grand jury]] to investigate doping charges, including: taking statements under oath from Armstrong's former team members and other associates; met with officials from [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Spain]], and [[Italy]]; and requested samples from the [[French Anti-Doping Agency]] (AFLD). The investigation was led by [[Jeff Novitzky]], an investigator from the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] (USADA), who also investigated suspicions of steroid use by [[baseball]] players [[Barry Bonds]] and [[Roger Clemens]]. The probe was terminated on February 3, 2012 with no charges filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CYC_DOPING_ARMSTRONG|title=Prosecutors close Armstrong inquiry, no charges|accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Specific allegations ===

==== 1995–2005 ====
Armstrong faced accusations of doping as early as the 1999 Tour de France. Specifically, many European papers contended his victory in Stage 9, where he seemingly ascended [[the Alps]] with almost no difficulty, could not have been possible through natural means.  Armstrong adamantly denied this, and the American press generally supported him. Armstrong contended, among other things, that it would have made no sense for him to dope since he lived in France for most of the year. France has long had some of the strictest anti-doping laws in the world.&lt;ref name="CycleofLies"&gt;{{cite book|last=Macur|first=Juliet|title=Cycle of Lies: The Fall of Lance Armstrong|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|date=2014|isbn=9780062277220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong was criticized for working with controversial Italian trainer Michele Ferrari, who later claimed that the two were introduced by Belgian cyclist [[Eddy Merckx]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/riders/2003/interviews/?id=ferrari03b#equipe An Interview With Dr. Michele Ferrari, part two], 2003, Tim Maloney / Cyclingnews European Editor&lt;/ref&gt; American cyclist [[Greg LeMond]] described himself as "devastated" on hearing of them working together, while [[Tour de France]] organizer [[Jean-Marie Leblanc]] said, "I am not happy the two names are mixed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2001/jul/30/cycling.cycling1|title=Drugs issue refuses to go away due to winner's Ferrari links|date=July 29, 2001|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Ferrari's later-overturned conviction for "sporting fraud" and "abuse of the medical profession", Armstrong suspended his professional relationship with him, saying that he had "zero tolerance for anyone convicted of using or facilitating the use of performance-enhancing drugs" and denying that Ferrari had ever "suggested, prescribed or provided me with any performance-enhancing drugs."

Ferrari was later absolved of all charges by an Italian [[appeals court]] of the sporting fraud charges as well as charges of abusing his medical license to write prescriptions. The court stated that it overturned his conviction "because the facts do not exist" to support the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2006/may06/may27news |title=www.cyclingnews.com&amp;nbsp;– The World Centre of Cycling |publisher=Future Publishing Limited |accessdate=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrari, however, is still banned from practicing medicine with cyclists by the [[Italian Cycling Federation]]. According to Italian authorities, Armstrong met with Ferrari as recently as 2010 in a country outside of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], "Lance has suspicious ties: source", ''[[Japan Times]]'', April 17, 2011, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Walsh and fellow reporter [[Pierre Ballester]] published a French-language book alleging Armstrong had used performance-enhancing drugs, entitled ''L. A. Confidentiel&amp;nbsp;– Les secrets de Lance Armstrong''. On top of O'Reilly's aforementioned allegations, another figure in the book, [[Steve Swart]], claims he and other riders, including Armstrong, began using drugs in 1995 while members of the [[Motorola]] team; this claim was denied by other team members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/stop-strong-arm-tactics-1-1395113 | title=Stop strong-arm tactics | publisher=Scotsman.com | date=June 20, 2004 | accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2 Ex-Teammates of Cycling Star Admit Drug Use|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/12/sports/othersports/12cycling.html| author=Juliet Macur|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 12, 2006|accessdate=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations in the book were reprinted in ''The Sunday Times'' in a story by deputy sports editor Alan English in June 2004. Armstrong sued for [[libel]], and the paper [[settled out of court]] after a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judge in a pre-trial ruling stated that the article "meant accusation of guilt and not simply reasonable grounds to suspect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/tourdefrance2006/story/0,,1810152,00.html |title=''The Guardian'' |publisher=Sport.guardian.co.uk |date= July 1, 2006|accessdate=July 17, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper's lawyers stated, "''The Sunday Times'' has confirmed to Mr. Armstrong that it never intended to accuse him of being guilty of taking any performance-enhancing drugs and sincerely apologized for any such impression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=William Fotheringham |url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/tourdefrance2005/story/0,,1536208,00.html |title=Armstrong faces legal marathon |publisher=Sport.guardian.co.uk |date= July 26, 2005|accessdate=July 17, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ballester and Walsh subsequently published ''L.A. Official'' and ''Le Sale Tour'' (''The Dirty Trick''), further pressing their claims that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career.

On March 31, 2005, Mike Anderson, Armstrong's personal assistant of two years, filed a brief&lt;ref&gt;[http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/sports/040105_lance.pdf Court brief], by ''Mike Anderson'', March 31, 2005&amp;nbsp;– (warning: PDF-file, 2.8 MB)&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County District Court]] in [[Texas]], as part of a legal battle following his termination in November 2004. In the brief, Anderson claimed that he discovered a box of [[androstenone]] while cleaning a bathroom in Armstrong's apartment in [[Girona|Girona, Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/shared/sports/tourdefrance/2005/040105lance.html | title=Papers: Lance had steroid in home | publisher=Austin American Statesman | date=April 1, 2005 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051203160602/http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/shared/sports/tourdefrance/2005/040105lance.html |archivedate= December 3, 2005 | author=Halliburton, Suzanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Androstenone is not a banned substance, and Anderson stated in a subsequent [[deposition (law)|deposition]] that he had no direct knowledge of Armstrong using such substances.

==== 2006–2008 ====
In June 2006, the French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' reported claims by [[Frankie Andreu|Frankie and Betsy Andreu]] during a deposition that Armstrong had admitted using performance-enhancing drugs to his physician just after brain surgery in 1996. The Andreus' testimony was related to litigation between Armstrong and SCA Promotions, a [[Dallas]]-based insurer who balked at paying a [[United States dollar|US$]]5 million bonus for Armstrong's sixth Tour victory due to the claims raised in ''L. A. Confidentiel''. The suit was settled out of court, with SCA paying Armstrong and Tailwind Sports US$7.5&amp;nbsp;million, to cover the bonus plus interest and lawyers' fees. Betsy Andreu's testimony stated, "And so the doctor asked him a few questions, not many, and then one of the questions he asked was... have you ever used any performance-enhancing drugs? And Lance said yes. And the doctor asked, what were they? And Lance said, [[growth hormone]], [[cortisone]], [[Erythropoietin|EPO]], [[steroid]]s and [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]]."&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5508863 |title=Ex-Friends Say Armstrong Admitted Drug Use |publisher=Npr.org |accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong suggested Betsy may have been confused by possible mention of his post-operative treatment, which included steroids and EPO that are taken to counteract the side effects of intensive [[chemotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.velonews.com/news/fea/10091.0.html | title=Armstrong issues statement | publisher=VeloNews | date=June 23, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705034015/http://www.velonews.com/news/fea/10091.0.html |archivedate = July 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Andreus' allegation was not supported by the eight other people present, including Armstrong's doctor Craig Nichols,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2006/06/news/papers-charge-armstrong-admitted-doping_10088 | title=Papers charge Armstrong admitted doping | publisher=VeloNews | date=June 23, 2006 | accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or his medical history. According to LeMond, he had recorded a conversation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://j.b5z.net/i/u/2132106/m/gregstef.mp3 recorded conversation]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[MP3]] file&lt;/ref&gt; transcribed for review by [[National Public Radio|NPR]], in which Armstrong's contact at Oaklety, Inc., Stephanie McIlvain, corroborated Betsy's account. However, McIlvain contradicted LeMond's allegations and denied [[under oath]] that the incident ever occurred.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

In July 2006, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published a story on the allegations raised in the SCA case.&lt;ref name="trail"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/09/sports/sp-armstrong9 |title=Allegations Trail Armstrong Into Another Stage |last=Abrahamson |first=Alan |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 9, 2006 |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report cited evidence at the trial, including the results of an AFLD test and an analysis of these results by an [[expert witness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-070806-sp-armstrong-g,0,1296880.graphic | title=Evidence of a banned substance? | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=July 8, 2006 | accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Times'', [[Australia]]n researcher Michael Ashenden testified that Armstrong's levels rose and fell, consistent with a series of injections during the 1999 Tour. Ashenden, a paid expert retained by SCA Promotions, told [[arbitration|arbitrators]] the results painted a "compelling picture" that the world's most famous cyclist "used EPO in the '99 Tour."&lt;ref name="trail"/&gt;

SCA president Bob Hamman knew his chances of winning the suit were slim, since the language in SCA's contract with Armstrong stipulated that the money had to be paid. However, he believed that the testimony and evidence would prove that Armstrong was a doper, and would be enough to trigger an investigation by sporting authorities. His hunch proved right; before the ''Times'' ran its story on the case, USADA general counsel [[Travis Tygart]] contacted Hamman and asked to see the evidence he'd gleaned.&lt;ref name="CycleofLies"/&gt;

==== 2009–2011 ====
Ashenden's findings were disputed by the Vrijman report, which pointed to procedural and privacy issues in dismissing the AFLD test results. The ''Times'' article also provided information on testimony given by Swart, the Andreus, and an [[instant messaging]] conversation between Frankie Andreu and [[Jonathan Vaughters]] regarding blood-doping in the [[peloton]]. Vaughters signed a statement disavowing the comments and stating he had "no personal knowledge that any team in the Tour de France, including Armstrong's Discovery team in 2005, engaged in any prohibited conduct whatsoever." Frankie signed a statement affirming the conversation took place as indicated on the instant messaging logs submitted to the court.&lt;ref name="Andy Shen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://velocitynation.com/content/interviews/2009/michael-ashenden|accessdate=June 24, 2009|title=Interviews&amp;nbsp;– Michael Ashenden|publisher=Velocity Nation|date=February 4, 2009|first=Andy|last=Shen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SCA trial was settled out of court, and while no verdict or finding of facts was rendered, Armstrong regarded the outcome as proof that the doping allegations were baseless.&lt;ref name="Andy Shen"/&gt;

On May 20, 2010, former U.S. Postal teammate [[Floyd Landis]] – who had previously been stripped of the 2006 Tour title after a positive drug test – accused Armstrong of doping in 2002 and 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cyclist Armstrong Denies Charges|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703691804575255410855321120|accessdate=March 7, 2014|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=May 20, 2010|author=Vanessa O'Connell|author2=Reed Albergotti}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landis also claimed that Postal team director Johan Bruyneel had [[bribe]]d [[Hein Verbruggen]], former president of the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI), to keep quiet about a positive Armstrong test in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hart |first=Simon |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/cycling/lancearmstrong/7746819/Floyd-Landis-puts-Lance-Armstrong-at-the-centre-of-new-drug-allegations.html |title=Floyd Landis puts Lance Armstrong at the centre of new drug allegations |publisher=Telegraph |date=May 20, 2010 |accessdate=July 17, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cossins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/kimmage-landis-allegations-will-decide-the-sports-future|title=Kimmage: Landis allegations will decide the sport's future|author=Peter Cossins|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|date=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landis admitted there was no documentation supporting his claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/cycling/news/story?id=5203604|title=Landis admits doping, accuses Lance|author=Bonnie D.

Landis also maintained that he witnessed Armstrong receiving multiple blood transfusions, and dispensing testosterone patches to his teammates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blood Brothers|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704911704575326753200584006|accessdate=March 7, 2014|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=July 2, 2010|author=Vanessa O'Connell|author2=Reed Albergotti}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 25, 2010, the UCI disputed Landis's claims, insisting that "none of the tests revealed the presence of EPO in the samples taken from riders at the [[2001 Tour de Suisse|2001 Tour of Switzerland]]." According to [[ESPN]], "Landis claimed that Armstrong tested positive while winning in 2002, a timeline Armstrong himself said left him 'confused,' because he did not compete in the event in 2002."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/cycling/news/story?id=5218887 |title=International Cycling Union refutes Floyd Landis' claims about 2001 Tour de Suisse |publisher=ESPN |date=May 25, 2010 |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, former Armstrong teammate [[Tyler Hamilton]] told [[CBS News]] that he and Armstrong had together taken EPO before and during the 1999, 2000, and 2001 Tours de France. Armstrong's attorney, Mark Fabiani, responded that Hamilton was lying.&lt;ref name="60minutesEPO"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-18560_162-20064858.html | title=Ex-teammate: I saw Lance Armstrong inject EPO | publisher=CBS News | work=60 Minutes | date=May 20, 2011 | accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying ''[[60 Minutes]]'' investigation alleged that two other former Armstrong teammates, Frankie Andreu and [[George Hincapie]], have told federal investigators that they witnessed Armstrong taking banned substances, including EPO, or supplied Armstrong with such substances.&lt;ref name="60minutesEPO"/&gt; Fabiani stated in response that, "We have no way of knowing what happened in the grand jury and so can't comment on these anonymously sourced reports."&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], "Report says Hincapie told feds Armstrong used PEDs", ''[[Japan Times]]'', May 22, 2011, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton further claimed that Armstrong tested positive for EPO during the 2001 Tour de Suisse; ''60 Minutes'' reported that the UCI intervened to conceal those test results, and that donations from Armstrong totaling US$125,000 may have played into said actions.&lt;ref name="60minutesEPO"/&gt;

Martial Saugy, chief of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] anti-doping agency, later confirmed that they found four urine samples suspicious of EPO use at the 2001 race, but said there was no "positive test" and claimed not to know whether the suspicious results belonged to Armstrong. As a result, Armstrong's lawyers demanded an apology from ''60 Minutes''.&lt;ref&gt;Risling, Greg, "[http://beta.news.yahoo.com/armstrongs-lawyers-want-apology-60-minutes-122558887.html Armstrong's lawyers want apology from '60 Minutes']", [[Yahoo!

Interviewed by the [[BBC]], Hamilton again insisted that he and Armstrong had routinely doped together. Dismissing the fact that Armstrong had passed numerous drug tests, Hamilton said that he himself had also passed hundreds of drug tests while doping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzTdj4sBB2U|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the documentary ''The World According to Lance Armstrong'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xvx95c_the-world-according-to-lance_news|title=The World According to Lance Armstrong|first=Jeffrey|last=Tillotson|work=DailyMotion|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212145324/http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xvx95c_the-world-according-to-lance_news|archive-date=December 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; attorney Jeffrey Tillotson, who represented SCA Promotions in the 2005 lawsuit, stated that he thought that the evidence collected by his legal team showed that Armstrong had been using performance-enhancing drugs since the beginning of his career.

In December 2012, Armstrong and his attorney, Tim Herman, held a secret meeting at the [[Denver]] offices of former Colorado governor [[Bill Ritter]] in an attempt to negotiate a reduction of Armstrong's lifetime ban down to one year.

== 1999 Tour de France urine tests ==

On August 23, 2005, ''L'Équipe'', a major French daily sports newspaper, reported on its front page under the headline "le mensonge Armstrong" ("The Armstrong Lie") that 6 urine samples taken from the cyclist during the prologue and five stages of the 1999 Tour de France, frozen and stored since at "Laboratoire national de dépistage du dopage de Châtenay-Malabry" (LNDD), had tested positive for [[erythropoietin]] (EPO) in recent retesting conducted as part of a research project into EPO testing methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Cyclisme/DOPAGE_ARMSTRONG.html |title=L'EQUIPE.FR Cyclisme&amp;nbsp;– CYCLISME&amp;nbsp;– Affaire Armstrong |work=L'Équipe |location=France |accessdate=July 17, 2010|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051018095124/http://www.lequipe.fr/Cyclisme/DOPAGE_ARMSTRONG.html|archivedate = October 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.mywire.com/pubs/AFP/2005/08/23/977278?&amp;pbl=27 |title=AFP: No comment on Armstrong from US cycling, anti-doping groups |publisher=MyWire |date=August 23, 2005 |accessdate=July 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107034352/http://www.mywire.com/pubs/AFP/2005/08/23/977278?&amp;pbl=27 |archivedate=November 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong immediately replied on his website, saying, "Unfortunately, the witch hunt continues and tomorrow's article is nothing short of tabloid journalism. The paper even admits in its own article that the science in question here is faulty and that I have no way to defend myself. They state: 'There will therefore be no counter-exam nor regulatory prosecutions, in a strict sense, since defendant's rights cannot be respected.' I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance enhancing drugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2005/08/news/litke-suspicion-remains-lances-opponent_8749 | title=Litke: Suspicion Remains Lance's Opponent | publisher=VeloNews | date=August 24, 2005 | accessdate=July 23, 2012 | author=Litke, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Head of AFLD Pierre Bordry stated: "Scientifically there is no problem to analyze these samples&amp;nbsp;– everything is correct" and "If the analysis is clean it would have been very good for him.

In October 2005, in response to calls from the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for an independent investigation, the UCI appointed Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman to investigate the handling of urine tests by the French national anti-doping laboratory, LNDD.

The recommendation of the commission's report was no disciplinary action against any rider on the basis of LNDD research.

In April 2009, Ashenden said that "the LNDD absolutely had no way of knowing athlete identity from the sample they're given. They have a number on them, but that's never linked to an athlete's name. The only group that had both the number and the athlete's name is the federation, in this case it was the UCI." He added "There was only two conceivable ways that synthetic [[erythropoietin|EPO]] could've gotten into those samples. One, is that Lance Armstrong used EPO during the '99 Tour. The other way it could've got in the urine was if, as Lance Armstrong seems to believe, the laboratory spiked those samples. Now, that's an extraordinary claim, and there's never ever been any evidence the laboratory has ever spiked an athlete's sample, even during the Cold War, where you would've thought there was a real political motive to frame an athlete from a different country. There's never been any suggestion that it happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://velocitynation.com/content/interviews/2009/michael-ashenden |title=The possibility of tampering |publisher=Velocitynation.com |accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Michael Ashenden's statements are at odds with the findings of the Vrijman report. "According to Mr. Ressiot, the manner in which the LNDD had structured the results table of its report&amp;nbsp;– i.e. listing the sequence of each of the batches, as well as the exact number of urine samples per batch, in the same (chronological) order as the stages of the 1999 Tour de France they were collected at&amp;nbsp;– was already sufficient to allow him to determine the exact stage these urine samples referred to and subsequently the identity of the riders who were tested at that stage." The Vrijman report also says "Le Monde of July 21 and 23, 1999 reveal that the press knew the contents of original doping forms of the 1999 Tour de France".&lt;ref name="Scholten c.s. Advocaten"/&gt;

== 2013 confession to doping ==

In an interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]] that aired January 17 and 18, 2013, on the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]], Armstrong confessed that he has used banned performance-enhancing drugs throughout much of his cycling career, most recently in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/19/us-cycling-armstrong-admitting-idUSBRE90H04620130119 | work=Reuters | title=Armstrong admits doping in "toxic" tale | date=January 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted that he used [[erythropoietin]] and [[human growth hormone]], and that he had [[blood doping|blood doped]] as well as falsifying documents saying he passed drug tests. Doping helped him for each of his seven Tour de France wins, Armstrong told Winfrey. According to USADA, samples from Armstrong taken in 2009 and 2010 as well are "fully consistent with blood manipulation including EPO use and/or blood transfusions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lance Armstrong and USADA's doping charges|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2012/jun/14/lance-armstrong-usada-doping-charges|accessdate=March 10, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=June 14, 2012|location=London|first=Matt|last=Seaton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong is fighting to avoid paying millions of dollars in prize money back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Armstrong sued over prize money|url=http://www.sportal.com.au/other-sports-news-display/armstrong-sued-over-prize-money-221220|accessdate=March 10, 2013|newspaper=Sportal|date=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2016 speech to [[University of Colorado, Boulder]] professor [[Roger A.

IMS Associates required all executives and key employees to take the [[Erhard Seminars Training|EST]] Standard Training.  ''[[Forbes]]'' considered Millard's requirements - which placed a heavy emphasis on [[self-actualization]] and encouraged vast discrepancies between executives and staff - were a key contributor to the downfall of the company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/asap/2001/0402/Cult_xtraCrosby_2.html|title=History of Cults: A Trail of True Believers|last=Crosby|first=Kip|date=2001-02-04|accessdate=2008-10-27|publisher=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Freiberger]] and [[Michael Swaine (technical author)|Michael Swaine]] concurred in ''[[Fire in the Valley: The Making of The Personal Computer]]'', noting that Millard's EST-induced unwillingness to admit a task might be impossible was a key factor in IMSAI's demise.&lt;ref name="fire"&gt;{{cite book

==History==
===Consultancy===

In May 1972, [[William Millard (businessman)|William Millard]] began business individually as ''IMS Associates'' (IMS) in the area of computer [[consultancy]] and engineering, using his home as an office.  The work done by IMS was similar to that Millard had done previously for the city and county of [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="fire"/&gt; By 1973, Millard founded IMS Associates, Inc. Millard soon found [[Financial capital|capital]] for his business, and received several [[contract]]s, all for software. IMS provided advanced engineering and software management to [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] users, including business and the [[United States Government]].&lt;ref name="fischer"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Electronics Dec 11 1975"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Scrupski | first = Stephen | title = Coming: cheap, powerful computers | journal = Electronics | volume = 48 | issue = 25 | pages =67–68 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | date = December 11, 1975}} "Hypercube II will sell for about $80,000." "IMS marketing director William Millard says military and government agencies have already expressed great interest in Hypercube" &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Electronics Aug 21 1975"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Disk system is 'intelligent'| journal = Electronics | volume = 48 | issue = 17 | page =129 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | date = August 21, 1975}} "Called the IMSAI 108, the system can handle 54 megabytes of data with a single spindle or, according to IMS director of marketing William H. Millard, it could be expanded to handle up to 16 drives-864 megabytes-'without any trouble at all.'" "The single-spindle model costs $29,500, and a dual-spindle (108 megabytes) model is priced at$47,500."&lt;/ref&gt;

===IMSAI 8080===

{{main|IMSAI 8080}}
[[File:IMSAI8080.jpg|right|thumb|216px|The [[IMSAI 8080]].]]
In 1974, IMS was contacted by a client which wanted a "[[workstation]] system" that could complete jobs for any [[General Motors]] new-car dealership. IMS planned a system including a [[Computer terminal|terminal]], small computer, [[Computer printer|printer]], and special software. Five of these work stations were to have common access to a [[hard disk]], which would be controlled by a small computer. Eventually product development was stopped. Millard and his chief engineer Joe Killian turned to the [[microprocessor]].

Intel had announced the 8080 chip, and compared to the 4004 to which IMS Associates had been first introduced, the 8080 looked like a "real computer".  Full-scale development of the [[IMSAI 8080]] was put into action, and by October 1975 an ad was placed in ''[[Popular Electronics]]'', receiving positive reactions.&lt;ref name = "PE Oct 1975"&gt;{{cite magazine | author = IMS  Associates, Inc. |date=October 1975 | title = IMSAI and Altair Owners |magazine= Popular Electronics | volume = 8 | issue = 4 |page=110 | publisher = Ziff Davis}} Advertisement: IMSAI 8080 computer with 1K of RAM. $439 kit, $621 assembled.&lt;/ref&gt; IMS shipped the first IMSAI 8080 kits on 16 December 1975&lt;ref name="SS1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lundin|first=Leigh| title=An Apple Today |url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2011/10/apple-today.html| work=Technology| publisher=SleuthSayers.org |location=[[Orlando]]| date=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly after turned to fully assembled units.&lt;ref name="ComputerLand"/&gt; Between 17,000 and 20,000 units were eventually produced, with an additional 2500 produced under the Fischer-Freitas name thereafter.&lt;ref name="cho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/brochures/companies.php?alpha=g-i&amp;company=com-42bc1d195cbb3|title=Company: IMS Associates, Inc. (IMSAI)|publisher=Computerhistory.org|accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition===

In 1976, as IMS had completed its transition from a consultancy firm into a manufacturing firm, the name of the company was changed to IMSAI Manufacturing Corporation.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imsai.net/history/imsai_history/imsai_pre_history.htm|title=The History of IMSAI - The Path to Excellence|publisher=IMS Associates, Inc.|year=1978|accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ComputerLand===

{{main|ComputerLand}}

The release of the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] by [[Zilog]] in 1976 quickly put an end to the dominance of 8080 machines as the new chip had an improved instruction set, could be clocked at faster speeds, and had on-chip DRAM refresh. IMSAI sales quickly plummeted and so in 1977 Millard decided to take the company through another transition, this time from a computer manufacturing company to a computer retailer. He established a chain of [[Franchising|franchise]]d retail outlets, initially called Computer Shack (the name was changed to ComputerLand following legal threats from [[Radio Shack]]).&lt;ref name="pchist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc-history.org/imsai.htm|title=IMSAI 8080|publisher=PC-History.org|accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ComputerLand retailed not only IMSAI 8080s, but also computers from companies including [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[North Star Computers|North Star]], and [[Cromemco]].  The 8080 sold poorly in comparison, and IMSAI developed the [[List_of_machines_running_CP/M#I|IMSAI VDP-80]], an [[all-in-one computer]] which worked poorly.  Many franchise dealers refused to retail most IMSAI products except those that retained popularity including the IMSAI 8080.  With most of the IMSAI resources [[asset stripping|stripped]] to fund ComputerLand's expansion, and with Millard's attention diverted, IMS Associates, Inc. went into a "tailspin",&lt;ref name="fire"/&gt; and filed for [[bankruptcy]] in October 1979.&lt;ref name="pchist"/&gt;

The [[trademark]] was eventually acquired by Thomas "Todd" Fischer and Nancy Freitas (former early employees who undertook continued support after the parent company folded), now doing business as Fischer-Freitas Company (since October 1978), who continued manufacturing and service support under their newly acquired and trade marked IMSAI badge (such as the [[IMSAI Series Two]]), and continue support to this day.&lt;ref name="cho"/&gt;  ComputerLand stores continued to prosper retailing [[IBM]] computers until IBM abandoned the 8-bit [[ISA bus]] in 1984; the franchises became independent following a series of bitter and costly legal battles with Millard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1985/04/15/65788/index.htm|title=ComputerLand's suddenly poorer boss|publisher=[[CNN Money]]|date=1985-04-15|last=Brody|first=Michael|accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12472">'''Improved military rifle propellants''' are tubular [[nitrocellulose]] [[smokeless powder|propellants]] evolved from [[World War I]] through [[World War II]] for loading military and commercial ammunition and sold to civilians for reloading rifle ammunition for hunting and target shooting.  These propellants were [[DuPont]] modifications of [[United States]] [[artillery]] propellants.&lt;ref name=tld&gt;Davis pp.296&amp;297&lt;/ref&gt; DuPont miniaturized the large artillery grains to form military rifle propellants suitable for use in small arms. These were improved during the first world war to be more efficient in rimless military cartridges replacing earlier rimmed rifle cartridges. Four-digit numbers identified experimental propellants, and a few successful varieties warranted extensive production by several manufacturers. Some were used almost exclusively for military contracts, or commercial ammunition production, but a few have been distributed for civilian use in [[handloading]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe pp.148&amp;163-172&lt;/ref&gt; Improved military rifle propellants are coated with [[dinitrotoluene]] (DNT) to slow initial burning and [[graphite]] to minimize static electricity during blending and loading.  They contain 0.6% [[diphenylamine]] as a stabilizer and 1% [[potassium sulfate]] to reduce muzzle flash.&lt;ref name="nra"&gt;[[William C. Davis, Jr.|Davis, William C., Jr.]] ''Handloading'' (1981) National Rifle Association pp.31–32&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1960s nitrocellulose rifle propellant canister.png|right|thumb|Specification 4831 packaged for retail distribution ''circa'' 1960.]]

== Reaction mechanism ==
[[John Bernadou]] patented a single-base propellant while working at the [[Naval Torpedo Station]] in 1897. Bernadou's [[colloid]] of [[nitrocellulose]] with [[ether]] and [[alcohol]] was formulated for the reaction pressures generated within [[naval artillery]].&lt;ref name=tld/&gt; The colloid was extruded in dense cylinders with longitudinal perforations to decompose in accordance with [[Piobert's law]]. If all external surfaces of the grain are ignited simultaneously, the grain reacts inward from the outside of the cylinder (creating a reaction area of decreasing size), and outward from each perforation (creating a reaction area of increasing size.) Propellant decomposition is initiated by heat causing the colloid to melt and form bubbles of reactive gas which decompose in a luminous [[exothermic reaction]] after the bubbles burst.  Rate of reaction is controlled by [[heat transfer]] through the [[temperature gradient]] from the luminous reacting gas through the bubbles to the intact colloid. Heat transfer (and rate of reaction) is faster if the bubbles are under pressure, because heat transfer is more efficient through smaller bubbles. These propellants may not react satisfactorily at low pressures within the [[oxygen]]-deficient atmosphere of a gun barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rimworld.com/nassarocketry/pdfs/031-PROPELLANT%20PROPERTIES.pdf |title=Propellant Properties |last= |first= |website= |publisher=Nevada Aerospace Science Associates |accessdate=19 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adaptation for use in military rifles ==
The [[United States Navy]] licensed use of the patent to [[DuPont]] for production of artillery propellant for ships operating in the [[Atlantic]], and to [[California Powder Works]] for ships operating in the [[Pacific]]. The [[United States Army]] also used Bernadou's propellant for artillery and for the new [[M1903 Springfield]] [[service rifle]] in 1909 with the {{convert|150|gr|g|sing=on}} M1906 bullet. Grain size varied with bore diameter. While artillery grain dimensions might be several inches or centimeters, the standard grains of military rifle propellant were {{convert|0.085|in|mm}} long and {{convert|0.03|in|mm}} in diameter. The Army identified this military rifle propellant as Pyro DG (for diphenylamine, graphited), and 500 tons per day were manufactured by various plants through the first world war.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe pp.164&amp;165&lt;/ref&gt;

== Package labeling ==
Military rifle propellant was manufactured in batches in a procedure taking about two weeks&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe p.7&lt;/ref&gt; from treating cotton linters with [[nitric acid]], through curing the extruded grains to evaporate excess ether and alcohol, and finally coating the dried grains with DNT and graphite. Each batch had somewhat different reaction rates, so testing was required to determine the appropriate charge to generate required reaction pressure in the intended cartridge. Test results were forwarded to the factory or arsenal assembling cartridges.&lt;ref&gt;Fairfield pp.35-41&lt;/ref&gt; Propellants packaged in small sheet metal canisters for sale to civilians were labeled ''Military Rifle Powder'' to distinguish the product from low-density "bulk" propellants intended to react at lower pressures in [[shotgun]]s or [[pistol]]s and from ''Sporting Rifle Powder'' for early [[lever action]] rifles unable to withstand the pressures of 20th-century service rifle cartridges. Charges of low-density "bulk" propellants were often similar to the volumes of [[gunpowder]] used in older firearms and reaction rates were less variable at low pressures appropriate for those cartridges;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hatcher |first1=Julian S |last2=Barr |first2=Al |last3=Neumann |first3=Charles L. |authorlink = |title =Handloading |publisher =[[National Rifle Association]] |volume =1 |edition = |date =1951 |location =Washington, DC |pages =36&amp;38 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; but each batch of military rifle propellant required a different canister label specifying the batch or lot number with the tested charge weight to generate appropriate reaction pressure in intended cartridges.

== Improvements ==
Orders from countries fighting World War I required determining charges for different European military rifle cartridges, and production volume supported research for improvements. Improved military rifle propellants included a longitudinal perforation converting each grain to a tube with a progressive burning interior surface allowing a more consistent gas generation rate through the reaction period. Early propellants were identified by a two-digit number. As the number of experimental variations increased, each improved military rifle propellant was identified by a four-digit number. In addition to the canisters available from DuPont, the [[Director of Civilian Marksmanship]] (DCM) sold surplus improved military rifle propellants to members of the [[National Rifle Association]]. By 1936 improved DuPont process control produced batches conforming to published reloading data rather than requiring different charge specifications for each batch;&lt;ref name="dupont"&gt;DuPont ''Better Loads for Better Shooting'' (1936) [[DuPont|E.I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Company]] pp.5&amp;6&lt;/ref&gt; and those propellants have remained in production. Non-conforming batches were used to load commercial and military cartridges following traditional testing procedures.

== World War II ==
Wartime temporarily interrupted production of civilian specification propellants, as major quantities of new specifications were manufactured. Number 4831 was used to load navy anti-aircraft machine gun ammunition, and number 4895 was used to load United States service rifle ammunition. As these propellants became military surplus after the war, large quantities of different batches were blended together to make products with uniform average performance for sale to civilians. Manufacture of these specifications for civilian use resumed after military surplus had been exhausted; but reaction characteristics were slightly different from the products distributed from military surplus supplies.&lt;ref name="hagel"&gt;Hagel, Bob ''Propellant Profiles'' (1982) Wolfe Publishing Company p.113 {{ISBN|0-935632-10-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20839">'''Inkjet technology''' is a method for depositing liquid droplets on a substrate.  It was originally developed for the publishing industry, but has    become a popular method in digital fabrication of electronic and mechanical devices. Although both terms, "inkjet technology" and "inkjet printing", are commonly used interchangeably, [[inkjet printing]] usually refers to the publishing industry, used for printing graphical content, while inkjet technology usually refers to the general purpose fabrication via inkjetting.

==Drop formation==
Various drop formation technologies exist, and can be classified into two main types: continuous inkjet (CIJ) and drop-on-demand (DOD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Le|first1=Hue P.|title=Progress and Trends in Ink-jet Printing Technology|journal=Journal of Imaging Science and Technology|date=1998|volume=42|issue=1|pages=49–62|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ist/jist/1998/00000042/00000001/art00007|archive-url=http://www.imaging.org/ist/resources/tutorials/inkjet.cfm|archive-date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While CIJ has a straightforward drop creation and sophisticated drop trajectory manipulation, DOD has sophisticated drop creation and no trajectory manipulation.

===Drop-on-demand (DOD)===
In this method, drops of ink are released individually, on demand, by a voltage signal. Released drops fall vertically without any trajectory manipulation. Commercial printheads can have tens to thousands of nozzles.

The two leading technologies for forcing ink out of a nozzle on demand are thermal DOD and piezoelectric DOD. Additional technologies include electrospray,&lt;ref name="Taylor1964"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=G.|title=Disintegration of Water Drops in an Electric Field|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=280|issue=1382|year=1964|pages=383–397|issn=1364-5021|doi=10.1098/rspa.1964.0151|bibcode = 1964RSPSA.280..383T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CloupeauPrunet-Foch1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cloupeau|first1=Michel|last2=Prunet-Foch|first2=Bernard|title=Electrohydrodynamic spraying functioning modes: a critical review|journal=Journal of Aerosol Science|volume=25|issue=6|year=1994|pages=1021–1036|issn=0021-8502|doi=10.1016/0021-8502(94)90199-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; acoustic discharge,&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|4308547|Liquid drop emitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; electrostatic membrane&lt;ref name="KamisukiHagata1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kamisuki|first1=S.|last2=Hagata|first2=T.|last3=Tezuka|first3=C.|last4=Nose|first4=Y.|last5=Fujii|first5=M.|last6=Atobe|first6=M.|title=A low power, small, electrostatically-driven commercial inkjet head|year=1998|pages=63–68|doi=10.1109/MEMSYS.1998.659730}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thermal bimorph.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|20070139473|Nozzle arrangent with movable ink ejection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Piezoelectric DOD====
[[Image:Micro Piezo Animation.gif|thumb|250px|right|The piezoelectric voltage pulse determines the jetted volume.]]
Piezoelectric DOD was invented in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3683212|Pulsed droplet ejecting system}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3946398|Method and apparatus for recording with writing fluids and drop projection means therefor}}&lt;/ref&gt; One disadvantage of the piezo-DOD method is that jettable inks must have viscosity and surface tension within a relatively strict range.

====Thermal inkjet (TIJ) DOD====
[[Image:Micro Piezo Comparison.gif|thumb|250px|right|Comparison between piezoelectric jet (left) and thermal jet (right)]]
Thermal DOD was introduced in the 1980s by [[Canon Inc.|Canon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|4723129|Bubble jet recording method and apparatus in which a heating element generates bubbles in a liquid flow path to project droplets}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hewlett-Packard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|4490728|Thermal ink jet printer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One disadvantage of this method is that the variety of inks compatible with TIJ is essentially limited, because this method is compatible with inks that have high [[vapour pressure]], low [[boiling point]] and high [[kogation]] stability.&lt;ref name="YeatesXu2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shirota|first1=K.|last2=Shioya|first2=M.|last3=Suga|first3=Y.|last4=Eida|first4=T.|title=Kogation of Inorganic Impurities in Bubble Jet Ink|year=1996|pages=218–219|url=http://www.imaging.org/IST/store/epub.cfm?abstrid=2161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water being such a solvent, limited the popularity of this method for non-industrial photo printing only, where water-based inks are used.

===Continuous inkjet (CIJ)===
In this method, a column of ink is released continuously from the nozzle. The ink column spontaneously breaks into separate drops due to the [[Plateau–Rayleigh instability|Plateau–Rayleigh flow instability]]. The formed ink drops are either deflected by an electric field towards the desired location on the substrate, or collected for reuse. CIJ printheads can be either have a single jet (nozzle) or multiple jets (nozzles).

One disadvantage of the CIJ method is the need for solvent monitoring. Since only a small fraction of the ink is being used for actual printing, solvent must be continually added to the recycled ink to compensate the evaporation that takes place during flight of the recycled drops.&lt;ref name="YeatesXu2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yeates|first1=Stephen G.|last2=Xu|first2=Desheng|last3=Madec|first3=Marie-Beatrice|last4=Caras-Quintero|first4=Dolores|last5=Alamry|first5=Khalid A.|last6=Malandraki|first6=Andromachi|last7=Sanchez-Romaguera|first7=Veronica|title=Fluids for Inkjet Printing|year=2014|pages=87–112|doi=10.1002/9781118452943.ch4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another disadvantage is the need for ink additives. Since this method is based on electrostatic deflection, ink additives, such as [[potassium thiocyanate]], may deteriorate the performance of the printed devices.&lt;ref name="YeatesXu2014"/&gt;

==The printhead==
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}
The printhead must have heating capability to print metallic alloys such as lead, tin, indium, zinc and aluminium. The process of printing of low-melting point metals is called "direct melt printing".

===Photo inkjet printhead===
===Tandem printheads===
===Multiple printheads===

==Fabrication approaches==
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}
The printed material is sometimes only one step in the process, which may include deposition of a [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] followed by a [[catalyst]], [[sintering]], [[photonic curing]], [[electroless plating]] etc., to give the final result.

* Direct deposition
* Mask printing
* Etching
* Inverse printing
* Powder bed

===Additive inkjet fabrication===
===Subtractive inkjet fabrication===

==Inkjettable materials==
The ink must be liquid, but may also contain small solids if they do not cause clogging. The solid particles should be smaller than 1/10 of the nozzle diameter to avoid clogging.

Drop formation is governed by two physical properties: [[surface tension]] and [[viscosity]]. The surface tension forms ejected drops into spheres, in accordance with [[Plateau–Rayleigh instability]]. The viscosity can be optimized at jet time by using an appropriate printhead temperature.

Generally, lower viscosity allows better droplet formation&lt;ref name="de GansDuineveld2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Gans|first1=B.-J.|last2=Duineveld|first2=P. C.|last3=Schubert|first3=U. S.|title=Inkjet Printing of Polymers: State of the Art and Future Developments|journal=Advanced Materials|volume=16|issue=3|year=2004|pages=203–213|issn=0935-9648|doi=10.1002/adma.200300385}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in practice only liquids with viscosities of 2-50 mPa s can be printed.&lt;ref name="Hutchings2012"&gt;{{Cite book |editor1-last=Hutchings |editor1-first=Ian M. |editor2-last=Martin |editor2-first=Graham D. |date=December 2012 |title=Inkjet Technology for Digital Fabrication |url=http://wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470681985.html |location=Cambridge |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-68198-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, liquids whose [[Ohnesorge number]] is larger than 0.1 and smaller than 1 are jettable.&lt;ref name="Derby2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Derby|first1=Brian|title=Inkjet Printing of Functional and Structural Materials: Fluid Property Requirements, Feature Stability, and Resolution|journal=Annual Review of Materials Research|volume=40|issue=1|year=2010|pages=395–414|issn=1531-7331|doi=10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McKinleyRenardy2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKinley|first1=Gareth H.|last2=Renardy|first2=Michael|title=Wolfgang von Ohnesorge|journal=Physics of Fluids|volume=23|issue=12|year=2011|pages=127101|issn=1070-6631|doi=10.1063/1.3663616|bibcode = 2011PhFl...23l7101M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JangKim2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jang|first1=Daehwan|last2=Kim|first2=Dongjo|last3=Moon|first3=Jooho|title=Influence of Fluid Physical Properties on Ink-Jet Printability|journal=Langmuir|volume=25|issue=5|year=2009|pages=2629–2635|issn=0743-7463|doi=10.1021/la900059m}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3316">'''Intermittent pneumatic compression''' is a therapeutic technique used in medical devices that include an air pump and inflatable auxiliary sleeves, gloves or boots in a system designed to improve venous circulation in the limbs of patients who suffer [[edema]] or the risk of [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) or [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gould MK, Garcia DA, Wren SM, Karanicolas PJ, Arcelus JI, Heit JA, Samama CM |year=2012 |title=Prevention of VTE in Nonorthopedic Surgical Patients: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines |journal=Chest |volume=141 |issue=2 suppl |pages=e227S-e277S |doi=10.1378/chest.11-2297 |pmid= 22315263 |pmc=3278061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In use, an inflatable jacket (sleeve, glove or boot) encloses the limb requiring treatment, and pressure lines are connected between the jacket and the air pump. When activated, the pump fills the air chambers of the jacket in order to pressurize the tissues in the limb, thereby forcing fluids, such as blood and lymph, out of the pressurized area. A short time later, the pressure is reduced, allowing increased blood flow back into the limb.

The primary functional aim of the device “is to squeeze blood from the underlying deep veins, which, assuming that the valves are competent, will be displaced proximally.”  When the inflatable sleeves deflate, the veins will replenish with blood.  The intermittent compressions of the sleeves will ensure the movement of venous blood.

==Sequential compression devices==
Sequential compression devices (SCD) utilize sleeves with separated areas or pockets of inflation, which works to squeeze on the appendage in a “milking action.”  The most distal areas will initially inflate, and the subsequent pockets will follow in the same manner.&lt;ref name = Morris&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Morris | first1 = R.

Sequential calf compression and graduated compression stockings are currently the preferred prophylaxis in neurosurgery for the prevention of DVT and pulmonary embolism, sometimes in combination with [[low molecular weight heparin]]s or unfractionated [[heparin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith SF, Biggs MT, Sekhon LH |title=Risk factors and prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis in neurosurgery |journal=Surg Technol Int |volume=14 |issue= |pages=69–76 |year=2005 |pmid=16525957 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intraoperative SCD-therapy is recommended during prolonged [[laparoscopic surgery]] to counter altered venous blood return from the lower extremities and consequent cardiac depression caused by [[pneumoperitoneum]] (inflation of the abdomen with carbon dioxide).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schwenk W, Haase O, Junghans T |title=Perspectives in sequential pneumatic compression of the lower extremities (SCD) for laparoscopic surgery |journal=Acta Chir.

== Early life and education ==
James Shaw Jr. was born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee. He attended [[Hunters Lane High School]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ajc.com/news/who-james-shaw-the-man-who-disarmed-the-waffle-house-shooter/JExEVIvYwpF5kQmsEIyz4O/|title=Who is James Shaw Jr., the man who disarmed the Waffle House shooter?|last=D'Angelo|first=Bob|date=2018-04-22|work=ajc|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw graduated from [[Tennessee State University]] with a degree in Electrical Engineering. He later studied online at [[Brightwood College]] and earned an Electrical Technician diploma.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brightwood.edu/blog/2018-07/james-shaw-brightwood-college-electrical-technician-graduate-to-waffle-house-hero/|title=James Shaw: Brightwood College Electrical Technician Graduate to Waffle House Hero|last=|first=|date=2018-07-27|work=Brightwood College|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Shaw began working in the electrical field at the age of 18. In an interview, Shaw stated that "... I've been destroying stuff and putting it back together since I was a little kid. I would take stuff apart and just hope I could reassemble it."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He began working at [[AT&amp;T]] as a wire technician&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; after graduating from Tennessee State University. At AT&amp;T, Shaw installs internet, television, and phone connections in residences. He also manages his own company, Imount Electric.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Nashville Waffle House shooting ==
When the shooting started, he ran to the bathroom—a bullet grazed his elbow and he realized there was no exit—so when he saw the gunman point the rifle down, perhaps to reload or fix a jam, he lunged and wrestled the weapon away from him.  The gunman was captured by police a few days later.  While four people died in the attack, it is likely that Shaw's action saved the lives of more restaurant patrons.  Afterwards, Shaw established a [[GoFundMe]] campaign to raise money for the families of the four victims.&lt;ref name=twsNPR111/&gt;  Total donations raised by Shaw surpassed {{US$|200000|2018|round=-4|about=yes}} in early May 2018.&lt;ref name="twsKFOR111"&gt;{{cite web

'''Kaqusha Jashari''' (born 16 August 1946)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rulers.org/indexj.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Kosovo Albanian]] politician and engineer by profession. She is a member of the [[Assembly of Kosovo]] on the [[Democratic Party of Kosovo]] list since 2007.

From 1986 until November 1988, she and [[Azem Vllasi]] were the two leading Kosovo politicians. In November 1988, they were both dismissed in the "[[anti-bureaucratic revolution]]" because of their unwillingness to accept the constitutional amendments curbing Kosovo's autonomy, and were replaced by proxies of [[Slobodan Milošević]], the leader of the [[League of Communists of Serbia]] at the time.

==Early life==
Kaqusha '''Fejzullahu''' was born in Skenderaj, the daughter of Halil Fejzullahu.&lt;ref name=isterao-stan&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vesti-online.com/Vesti/Srbija/442059/Iz-stana-me-isterao-otac-Kacuse-Jasari}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zemrashqiptare.net/news/id_2064/rp_0/act_print/rf_1/Printo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family had an apartment in [[Bulevar kralja Aleksandra]], [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref name=isterao-stan/&gt;

==Politics==
In May 1988 Jashari replaced Azem Vllasi as the President of the Provential Committee of the [[League of Communists of Kosovo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yugoslavia: A Concise History|last=Benson|first=Leslie|year=2001|page=149|isbn=978-0-333-79241-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iw9PHRR1oe4C&amp;pg=PA149}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that Serbia "accepted" her as it was said at the time it that her mother was Montenegrin.&lt;ref name="Meier2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Viktor Meier|title=Yugoslavia: A History of Its Demise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRCDR464ut0C&amp;pg=PA69|date=20 June 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-66511-2|pages=69–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 17 to 21 October there were Albanian protests throughout Kosovo against the changing of status of the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|SAP Kosovo]].&lt;ref name=NIN-59&gt;{{cite book|title=NIN. nedeljne informativne novine|issue=2531-2544|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3tgTAQAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Politika|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 November 1988, Jashari and Vllasi were forced to resign and [[Rahman Morina]] was elected President of the Provential Committee on 27 January 1989 by the Presidium of the Provential Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Destruction of Yugoslavia: Tracking the Break-Up 1980-92|first=Branka|last=Magaš|year=1993|page=208|isbn=978-0-86091-593-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5np99Vgc0YC&amp;pg=PA208}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sparked new protests by Albanian youths and workers.&lt;ref name=NIN-59/&gt; They were both dismissed because of their unwillingness to accept the constitutional amendments curbing Kosovo's autonomy, and were replaced by proxies of [[Slobodan Milošević]], the leader of the [[League of Communists of Serbia]] at the time.

On 20 October 1990 [[Marko Orlandić]] and Jashari guested the gathering of Serbs and Montenegrins in [[Kosovo Polje]], which was not met with positive reactions.&lt;ref name="Đoković1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Milorad Đoković|title=Kosmetski dosije: ispovesti i sudbine prognanih Kosovaca|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=si-5AAAAIAAJ|year=1990|publisher=AIZ Dosije|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the president of the Social Democratic Party of Kosovo (PSDK) from 1991 until 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shqipmedia.com/2008/11/kaqusha-jashari-gjyshe-dhe-kuzhiniere-e-mire/|accessdate=2010-12-03|title=Kaqusha Jashari: Gjyshe dhe kuzhiniere e mirë|publisher=ShqipMedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111211541/http://www.shqipmedia.com/2008/11/kaqusha-jashari-gjyshe-dhe-kuzhiniere-e-mire/|archivedate=2010-11-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when she was succeeded by the former prime minister and [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA) guerilla leader [[Agim Çeku]].

==Controversies==
According to Radmila Vuličević from Pristina, Jashari's father seized her apartment in Pristina in June 1999.&lt;ref name=isterao-stan/&gt; Jashari currently lives in the apartment.&lt;ref name=isterao-stan/&gt;

==Models==
===Librem 13 and 15 laptops===
In 2014 Purism launched a crowdfunding campaign on [[Crowd Supply]] to fund the creation of the Librem 15 laptop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crowdsupply.com/purism/librem-15|title=Librem 15: A Laptop That Respects Your Rights|website=Crowd Supply|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Librem 15 was marketed as a modern alternative to traditional [[Open-source hardware|free-hardware]] laptops, which tend to use older hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/purism-librem-15-review|title=Purism Librem 15 {{!}} Linux Journal|website=www.linuxjournal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/23/purism-aims-to-build-a-philosophically-pure-laptop/|title=Purism Aims To Build A Philosophically Pure Laptop|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2849795/purism-librem-15-linux-laptop-blends-high-end-hardware-with-totally-free-software.html|title=Purism Librem 15 Linux laptop blends high-end hardware with totally free software|work=PCWorld|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 15 in the name refers to the 15" screen size.

After the successful launch of the 15" laptop, purism created another campaign on Crowd Supply for a 13" model laptop, called the Librem 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crowdsupply.com/purism/librem-13|title=Librem 13: A Laptop That Respects Your Rights|website=Crowd Supply|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laptop was created with hardware kill switches, similar to the revision 2 of the 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/purism-puts-physical-kill-switches-latest-laptop|title=Purism Puts Physical Kill Switches on Latest Laptop|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign also got funded and the laptops shipped&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/purism-librem-13-review|title=Purism Librem 13 Review {{!}} Linux Journal|website=www.linuxjournal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018|03}}, Purism had two laptop models in production, the Librem 13 (version 2{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}) and Librem 15 (version 3{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}).&lt;ref name="TechRepub_L13_privacy" /&gt; Purism had already announced in December 2016 it would be preparing to move from a [[build to order]] production approach to a "ship from inventory" model with the new batches of Librem 13 and 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/posts/growing-to-ship-from-inventory-in-2017/|title=Growing to Ship from Inventory in 2017|last=Weaver|first=Todd|date=2016-12-15|website=puri.sm|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Librem 11 tablet===
A convertible tablet-to-laptop model, the Librem 11, was under development {{as of|2018|03|lc=yes}}.&lt;ref name="TechRepub_L13_privacy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/05/19/purism-introduces-privacy-focused-2-in-1-tablet/|title=Purism expands its line of privacy-focused devices to include a 2-in-1|last=Baldwin|first=Roberto|date=2016-05-19|website=Engadget|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purism Chief Executive Officer, Todd Weaver, stated that work on the Librem 11 would continue after the planned 2019 release of the Librem 5 smartphone.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Librem 5 smartphone===
In 2017, Purism started a crowdfunding campaign for ''Librem 5'', a [[smartphone]] aimed not only to run purely on the [[free software]] provided in PureOS, but to "[focus] on security by design and privacy protection by default". Purism claimed that the phone would become "the world's first ever IP-native mobile handset, using end-to-end encrypted decentralized communication."&lt;ref name="OSNews_security_privacy" /&gt; Purism cooperated with [[KDE]] and [[GNOME]] in its development of Librem 5.&lt;ref name="LinuxMag_ChallengeFreePhone" /&gt;

Plans for security on the Librem 5 include separation of the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] from the [[baseband processor]], which, according to ''[[Linux Magazine]]'', would make Librem 5 unique in comparison to other mobile phones.&lt;ref name="LinuxMag_ChallengeFreePhone" /&gt; Hardware [[kill switch]]es for [[Wi-Fi]] and [[Bluetooth]] communication and the phone's [[camera]], [[microphone]], and [[baseband processor]] are also planned.&lt;ref name="LinuxMag_ChallengeFreePhone" /&gt;

The default operating system planned for Librem 5 is Purism's PureOS, a [[Debian|Debian GNU/Linux]] derivative, with a choice of either GNOME or [[KDE_Plasma_5#Plasma_Mobile|KDE Plasma Mobile]] as the desktop environments.&lt;ref name="LinuxMag_ChallengeFreePhone" /&gt; [[Ubuntu Touch]] is also planned as a standard option for the operating system of Librem 5.&lt;ref name="Fossbytes_UbuntuTouch" /&gt;

Purism announced on 4 September 2018 that the launch date of Librem 5 would be April 2019, later than initially planned, because of two hardware bugs and the Europe/North America holiday season.&lt;ref name="Librem5_delay_April2019" /&gt; The two "silicon bugs" in components provided by [[NXP Semiconductors]] caused extreme battery draining, discharging the phone in about an hour. Development kits for software developers were planned for release in October 2018, mostly unaffected by the bug, since developers would normally connect the device to a mains power outlet rather than rely on the phone battery.&lt;ref name="Librem5_delay_April2019" /&gt;

===Librem Key===
Announced on 20 September 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/posts/introducing-the-librem-key/|title=Introducing the Librem Key – Purism|website=puri.sm|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Librem Key is a hardware USB [[security token]] with multiple features, including integration with a tamper-evident Heads BIOS, that ensures a Librem laptop BIOS was not maliciously altered since the last laptop launch. Also a one-time password storage with 3x [[HOTP]] (&lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 4226&lt;/nowiki&gt;) and 15 x [[TOTP (algorithm)|TOTP]] (&lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 6238&lt;/nowiki&gt;) and a integrated password manager (16 entries), 40 kbit/s true random number generator, and a tamper-resistant smart card. The key supports type A USB 2.0, has dimensions of 48 x 19 x 7 mm, and weights 6 g.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/products/librem-key/|title=Librem Key – Purism|website=puri.sm|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operating system==
Initially planning to preload its Librem laptops with the [[Trisquel]] operating system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://liliputing.com/2014/11/purism-hopes-crowdfund-high-end-open-source-laptop.html|title=Purism hopes to crowdfund a high-end, open source laptop|last=Linder|first=Brad|date=2014-11-19|work=|newspaper=Liliputing|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/posts/production-and-shipping-update/|title=Production and Shipping Update|last=Rahl|first=Jon|date=2015-05-17|website=puri.sm|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purism eventually moved off the Trisquel platform to rebase onto [[Debian]] for the 2.0 release of its PureOS [[Linux]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/posts/weekly-update-on-librem-production-2015-09-18/|title=Weekly Update on Librem Production 2015-09-18|last=Weaver|first=Todd|date=2015-09-18|website=puri.sm|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative to PureOS, Librem laptops were originally announced as purchasable with [[Qubes]] preloaded,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/12/qubes-os-will-ship-pre-installed-on-purisms-security-focused-librem-13-laptop/|title=Qubes OS will ship pre-installed on Purism’s security-focused Librem 13 laptop|last=Porup|first=J. M.|date=2015-12-14|work=|newspaper=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in July, 2017 Librem announced that Qubes was no longer an option for new orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/posts/2017-07-shipping-update-for-qubes-orders|title=A shipping update for Qubes-related orders – Purism|website=puri.sm|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017 the Free Software Foundation added PureOS to its list of endorsed GNU/Linux distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-adds-pureos-to-list-of-endorsed-gnu-linux-distributions-1|title=FSF adds PureOS to list of endorsed GNU/Linux distributions   — Free Software Foundation — working together for free software|website=www.fsf.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opennet.ru/opennews/art.shtml?num=47784|title=OpenNews: Фонд СПО признал PureOS полностью свободным дистрибутивом|website=www.opennet.ru|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BIOS==
In 2015, Purism began research to port the Librem 13 to [[coreboot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/posts/freeing-the-bios-the-memory-init-stage/|title=Freeing the BIOS: Memory Init|last=Moberg|first=Larry|date=2015-07-20|website=puri.sm|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/posts/2015-08-14-librem-13-weekly-progress-update/|title=2015-08-14: Librem 13: Weekly BIOS Progress Update|last=Moberg|first=Larry|date=2015-08-14|website=puri.sm|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/posts/2015-08-21-librem-13-weekly-progress-update/|title=2015-08-21 Librem 13: Weekly BIOS Progress Update|last=Moberg|first=Larry|date=2015-08-21|website=puri.sm|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the effort was initially stalled. By the end of the year, a coreboot developer completed an initial port of the Librem 13 and submitted it for review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://review.coreboot.org/#/c/13026/|title=Gerrit Code Review|last=Laurie|first=Duncan|date=2015-12-22|website=review.coreboot.org|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, hardware enablement developer Youness Alaoui joined Purism and was tasked to complete the coreboot port for the original Librem 13 and prepare a port for the second revision of the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/posts/diving-back-into-coreboot-development/|title=Diving back into coreboot development|last=Alaoui|first=Youness|date=2017-01-05|website=puri.sm|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since summer 2017, new Librem laptops are shipped with coreboot as their standard BIOS, while some older models can be updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/coreboot/|title=Downloading and installing coreboot on Purism Librem devices – Purism|website=puri.sm|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4893">A '''membrane oxygenator''' is a device used to add [[oxygen]] to, and remove [[carbon dioxide]] from the [[blood]]. It can be used in two principal modes: to imitate the function of the [[lung]]s in [[cardiopulmonary bypass|cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)]], and to oxygenate blood in longer term life support, termed [[extracorporeal]] membrane oxygenation, [[ECMO]].  A membrane oxygenator consists of a thin gas permeable membrane separating the blood and gas flows in the CPB circuit; oxygen diffuses from the gas side into the blood, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the gas for disposal.

== History ==

The history of the [[oxygenator]], or artificial lung, dates back to 1885, with the first demonstration of a disc oxygenator, on which blood was exposed to the atmosphere on rotating discs by Von Frey and Gruber.{{Ref|1}}  These pioneers noted the dangers of blood streaming, foaming and clotting. In the 1920s and 30s, research into developing extracorporeal oxygenation continued.  Working independently, Brukhonenko in the USSR and [[John Heysham Gibbon]] in the USA demonstrated the feasibility of extracorporeal oxygenation.  Brukhonenko used excised dog lungs while Gibbon used a direct contact drum type oxygenator, perfusing cats for up to 25 minutes in the 1930s.{{Ref|2}}

Gibbon’s pioneering work was rewarded in May 1953 with the first successful [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] operation.{{Ref|3}} The oxygenator was of the stationary film type, in which oxygen was exposed to a film of blood as it flowed over a series of stainless steel plates.

The disadvantages of direct contact between the blood and air were well recognized, and the less traumatic membrane oxygenator was developed to overcome these.  The first membrane artificial lung was demonstrated in 1955 by the group led by [[Willem Kolff]]{{Ref|4}} and in 1956 the first disposable membrane oxygenator removed the need for time consuming cleaning before re-use.{{Ref|5}} No patent was filed as Kolff believed that doctors should make technology available to all, without mind to profit.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The early artificial lungs used relatively impermeable [[polyethylene]] or [[Teflon]] homogeneous membranes, and it was not until more highly permeable [[silicone rubber]] membranes were introduced in the 1960s (and as hollow fibres in 1971) that the membrane oxygenator became commercially successful.{{Ref|6}}{{Ref|7}} The introduction of microporous hollow fibres with very low resistance to mass transfer revolutionized the design of membrane modules, as the limiting factor to oxygenator performance became the blood resistance.{{Ref|8}} Current designs of oxygenator typically use an extraluminal flow regime, where the blood flows outside the gas filled hollow fibers, for short term life support, while only the [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] membranes are approved for long term use.

The '''nasal cannula''' (NC) is a device used to deliver [[oxygen therapy|supplemental oxygen]] or increased airflow to a patient or person in need of [[respiratory system|respiratory]] help.  This device consists of a lightweight tube which on one end splits into two prongs which are placed in the [[nostril]]s and from which a mixture of air and oxygen flows. The other end of the tube is connected to an oxygen supply such as a portable oxygen generator, or a wall connection in a hospital via a [[flowmeter]].  The cannula is generally attached to the patient by way of the tube hooking around the patient's ears or by elastic head band.  The earliest, and most widely used form of adult nasal cannula carries 1–5 litres of oxygen per minute.

Cannulae with smaller prongs intended for infant or neonatal use can carry less than one litre per minute. Flow rates of up to 60 litres of air/oxygen per minute can be delivered through wider bore humidified nasal cannula.

The nasal cannula was invented by Wilfred Jones and patented in 1949 by his employer, [[The BOC Group|BOC]].&lt;ref name="Espacenet"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Supplemental oxygen ===
[[File:Nasal cannula.png|thumb|Nasal prongs]]
A nasal cannula is generally used wherever small amounts of supplemental oxygen are required, without rigid control of respiration, such as in oxygen therapy. Most cannulae can only provide oxygen at low flow rates—up to 5 litres per minute (L/min)—delivering an oxygen concentration of 28–44%. Rates above 5 L/min can result in discomfort to the patient, drying of the nasal passages, and possibly nose bleeds (epistaxis). Also with flow rates above 6 L/min, the laminar flow becomes turbulent and the oxygen therapy being delivered is only as effective as delivering 5-6 L/min.

The nasal cannula is often used in elderly patients or patients who can benefit from oxygen therapy but do not require it to self respirate. These patients do not need oxygen to the degree of wearing a [[non-rebreather mask]]. It is especially useful in those patients where vasoconstriction could negatively impact their condition, such as those suffering from strokes.

A nasal cannula may also be used by pilots and passengers in small, unpressurized aircraft that do not exceed certain altitudes. The cannula provides extra oxygen to compensate for the lower oxygen content available for breathing at the low ambient air pressures of high altitude, preventing hypoxia. Special aviation cannula systems are manufactured for this purpose.

Since the early 2000s, with the introduction of nasal cannula which uses heated humidification for [[respiratory gas humidification]], flows above 6 LPM have become possible without the associated discomfort,&lt;ref name="roca2010" /&gt; and with the added benefit of improving mucociliary clearance.&lt;ref name="hasani2008" /&gt;

===Nasal high flow therapy===
''(See: [[High-flow therapy]])''&lt;br /&gt;
High flows of an air/oxygen blend can be administered via a nasal cannula to accurately deliver high volume of oxygen therapy.&lt;ref name="sim2008" /&gt; [[Respiratory gas humidification]] allows the high flows to be delivered comfortably via the cannula.&lt;ref name="turnbull2008" /&gt; Nasal [[high flow therapy]] can be used as an effective alternative to face mask oxygen&lt;ref name="pmid21255498"/&gt; and allows the patient to continue to talk, eat and drink while receiving the therapy.&lt;ref name="tiruvoipati2009" /&gt;
Definition: Non-invasive delivery of oxygen air mixture delivered via a nasal cannula at flows that exceed the patient’s inspiratory flow demands with gas that has been optimally conditioned by warming and humidifying the gas to close to 100% relative humidity at body temperature.

{{more footnotes|date=May 2010}}
[[File:Nightcart.gif|thumb|right|18th-century London nightman's calling card]]

'''Night soil''' is a historically used [[euphemism]] for [[Human waste|human excreta]] collected from [[cesspit|cesspools]], privies, [[pail closet]]s, [[pit latrine]]s, [[privy midden]]s, [[septic tank]]s, etc. This material was removed from the immediate area, usually at night, by workers employed in this trade. Sometimes it could be transported out of towns and sold on as a [[fertilizer]]. 

Another definition is "untreated excreta transported without water (e.g. via containers or buckets)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sanitation safety planning: manual for safe use and disposal of wastewater, greywater and excreta.|author = Jackson, D| author2=Winkler, M| author3=Stenström, TA|publisher = World Health Organization|date=2015|isbn = 978 92 4 154924 0|url= http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssp-manual/en/|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "night soil" is largely an [[Archaism|archaic word]], used in historical contexts. The modern term is "fecal sludge"; [[fecal sludge management]] is an ongoing challenge, particularly in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name="Tilley"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|url=http://www.sswm.info/sites/default/files/reference_attachments/TILLEY%20et%20al%202014%20Compendium%20of%20Sanitation%20Systems%20and%20Technologies%20-%202nd%20Revised%20Edition.pdf|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies|edition = 2nd Revised|author = Tilley, E.|author2 = Ulrich, L.|author3 = Lüthi, C.|author4 = Reymond, Ph.|author5 = Zurbrügg, C.|date=2014|publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Night soil was produced as a result of a [[sanitation]] system in areas without [[Sewerage|sewer systems]] or [[septic tank]]s. In this system of waste management, the human feces are collected without dilution with water.

==Collection and disposal==
{{Main|Fecal sludge management}}
Feces were excreted into a container such as a [[chamber pot]], and sometimes collected in the container with urine and other waste ("slops", hence [[slopping out]]). The excrement in the pail was often covered with earth (soil), which may have contributed to the term "night soil." Often the deposition or excretion occurred within the residence, such as in a [[shophouse]]. This system may still be used in isolated rural areas or in urban slums in developing countries. The material was collected for temporary storage and disposed of depending on local custom.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Disposal has varied through time. In urban areas, a night soil collector arrived regularly, at varying time periods depending on the supply and demand for night soil collection. Usually this occurred during the night, giving the night soil its name.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In isolated rural areas such as in [[farm]]s, the [[household]] usually disposed of the night soil themselves.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Uses in agriculture==
{{Further|Reuse of excreta}}
Human excreta may be attractive as [[fertilizer]] because of the high demand for fertilizer and the relative availability of the material to create night soil. In areas where native soil is of poor quality, the local population may weigh the risk of using night soil.

The use of unprocessed human feces as fertilizer is a risky practice as it may contain [[Faecal-oral route|disease-causing pathogens]]. Nevertheless, in some developing nations it is still widespread. Common [[parasitic worm]] infections, such as [[ascariasis]], in these countries are linked to night soil use in agriculture, because the helminth eggs are in feces and can thus be transmitted from one infected person to another person ([[Fecal–oral route|fecal-oral transmission]] of disease).

These risks are reduced by proper [[fecal sludge management]], e.g. via [[compost]]ing. The safe reduction of [[human excreta]] into compost is possible. Some municipalities create [[compost]] from the [[sewage sludge]], but then recommend that it only be used on flower beds, not vegetable gardens. Some claims have been made that this is dangerous or inappropriate without the expensive removal of [[heavy metals]].

==History==

===Ancient Attica===
The use of sewage as fertilizer was common in ancient Attica. The sewage system of ancient Athens collected the sewage of the city in a large reservoir and then channelled it to the [[Cephissus (Athenian plain)|Cephissus river]] valley for use as fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will, ''The Life of Greece'', PP. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

===China, Hong Kong, and Singapore===
[[File:China; a woman carrying buckets of night-soil. Wellcome L0056427.jpg|thumb|A woman carrying buckets of night-soil, photographed in 1871.]]
The term is known, or even infamous, among the generations that were born in parts of China or [[Chinatowns]] (depending on the development of the infrastructure) before 1960. Post-[[World War II]] [[Chinatown, Singapore]], before the [[history of Singapore|independence of Singapore]], utilized night-soil collection as a primary means of waste disposal, especially as much of the infrastructure was damaged and took a long time to rebuild following the [[Battle of Singapore]] and subsequent [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore]]. Following the development of the economy and the [[standard of living]] after independence, the night soil system in Singapore is now merely a curious anecdote from the time of colonial rule when new systems developed.

The collection method is generally very manual and heavily relies on close human contact with the waste. During the Nationalist era when the [[Kuomintang]] ruled [[mainland China]], as well as Chinatown in Singapore, the night soil collector usually arrived with spare and relatively empty [[Bucket toilet|honey bucket]]s to exchange for the full honey buckets. The method of transporting the honey buckets from individual households to collection centers was very similar to delivering [[water supply|water supplies]] by an unskilled laborer, with the exception that the item being transported was not at all [[drinking water|potable]]  and it was being delivered ''from'' the household, rather than ''to'' the household. The collector would hang full honey buckets onto each end of a pole he carried on his shoulder and then proceeded to carry it through the streets until he reached the collection point.

Hong Kong has a similar euphemism for night soil collection, {{lang|zh|倒夜香}} ''dàoyèxiāng'', which literally means "emptying nocturnal fragrance".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Japan ===
{{see also|Toilets in Japan}}
The reuse of [[Human feces|feces]] as fertilizer was common in Japan. In [[Edo]] city, compost merchants gathered feces to sell for farmers. That was good additional income for apartment owners. [[Human waste|Human excreta]] of rich people were sold at higher prices because their diet was better; presumably, more nutrients remained in their excreta. Various historic documents dating from the 9th century detail the disposal procedures for toilet waste.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, P., Walthall. A., &amp; Palias, J. (2006). Modern east asia: A cultural, social, &amp; political history. Houghton Mifflin Company. Boston &amp; New York. p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;

Selling human waste products as fertilizers became much less common after [[World War II]], both for sanitary reasons and because of the proliferation of chemical fertilizers, and less than 1% is used for night soil fertilization{{Clarify|date=October 2009}}. The presence of the [[Occupation of Japan|United States occupying force]], by whom the use of human waste as fertilizer was seen as unhygienic and suspect, was also a contributing factor: "the Occupationaires condemned the practice, and tried to prevent their compatriots from eating vegetables and fruit from the local markets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.osu.edu/sites/rarebooks/japan/2_7_photos.html|title=Pictures|publisher=[[Ohio State University]]|accessdate=4 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615140135/http://library.osu.edu/sites/rarebooks/japan/2_7_photos.html|archivedate=15 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico and Central America===
Various [[Mesoamerican]] civilizations used human feces to fertilize their crops. The Aztecs, in particular, are well known for their famous [[chinampa]]s, artificial islands made of mud and human waste used to grow crops that could be harvested up to 7 times a year. Current research has placed the origins of chinampas in an Aztec town of [[Colhuacan (altepetl)|Culhuacan]] in the year 1100 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Blanton, "Prehispanic Settlement Patterns of the Ixtapalapa Peninsula Region, Mexico." Ph.D. dissertation, University of Michigan 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; They were constructed by first fencing an area between 30 m x 2.5 m and 91 m x 9 m, using wattle.&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, P. (1976).

Mathematical accuracy of Aztec land surveys assessed from records in the Codex Vergara. PNAS: University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; Then filled in with mud, sediment, feces and decaying vegetation. To stabilize the chinampas, trees were often planted on the corners, primarily ''āhuexōtl'' (''[[Salix bonplandiana]]'') or ''āhuēhuētl'' (''[[Taxodium mucronatum]]'').&lt;ref&gt;"Taxodium mucronatum". The Gymnosperm Database. Retrieved 2009-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinampas were very common before Spanish conquest and are still found in Mexico today.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Gladstone sanitary ware night soil containers 3928.JPG|thumb|Industrially produced "sanitary ware", now in the [[Gladstone Pottery Museum]]]]
A [[gong farmer]] was the term used in Tudor England for a person employed to remove human excrement from privies and cesspits.  Gong farmers were only allowed to work at night and the waste they collected had to be taken outside the city or town boundaries.

The rapid industrialisation of England during the nineteenth century led to mass urbanisation, over-crowding, and epidemics. One response was the development of the "Rochdale system", in which the town council arranged for the collection of the night soil from the outhouse attached to each dwelling or group of dwellings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calow|first1=Dennis|title=Home Sweet Home: A century of Leicester housing 1814-1914|date=2007|publisher=Univ of Leicester|url=http://cdm15407.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15407coll5/id/1181|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[pail closet]]). A later response was the passage of the [[Public Health Act 1875]], which led to the creation of [[Byelaw terraced house|byelaws regarding housing]], mandating one outhouse per house. These were still "earth closets" (not water closets i.e. WCs) and so still depended on the "night soil men" or "nightmen".

== Current examples ==

===India===
People responsible for the disposal of night soil are considered [[Dalit|untouchables]] in India. The practice of untouchability was banned by law when India gained independence, but the tradition widely persists as the law is difficult to enforce.  This "[[manual scavenging]]" is now illegal in all Indian states.

The Indian government's Union Ministry for Social Justice and Empowerment stated in 2003 that 676,000 people were employed in the manual collection of human waste in India. Social organizations have estimated that up to 1.3 million Indians collect such waste. Further, workers in the collection of human waste were confined to marriage amongst themselves, thereby leading to a waste-collecting caste, which passes its profession on from generation to generation.

Employment of Manual Scavengers and Creation of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act 1993 has made manual scavenging illegal.

=== Japan ===
Modern Japan still has areas with ongoing night soil collection and disposal. The Japanese name for the "outhouse within the house" style toilet, where night soil is collected for disposal, is ''kumitori benjo'' (汲み取り便所). The proper disposal or [[recycling]] of sewage remains an important research area that is highly political.

'''Orthotics''' ({{lang-el|Ορθός|translit=ortho|lit=to straighten, to align}}) is a [[medical specialty]] that focuses on the design and application of '''orthoses'''. An {{dfn|orthosis}} (plural: ''orthoses'') is "an externally applied device used to modify the structural and functional characteristics of the neuromuscular and [[skeletal system]]".&lt;ref&gt;ISO 8549-1:1989&lt;/ref&gt; An '''orthotist''' is the primary medical clinician responsible for the prescription, manufacture and management of orthoses.
An orthosis may be used to:
* Control, guide, limit and/or immobilize an [[Limb (anatomy)|extremity]], [[joint]] or body segment for a particular reason
* Restrict movement in a given direction
* Assist movement generally
* Reduce [[weight bearing]] forces for a particular purpose
* Aid [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] from [[fractures]] after the removal of a cast
* Otherwise correct the shape and/or function of the body, to provide easier movement capability or reduce pain
Orthotics combines knowledge of [[anatomy and physiology]], [[pathophysiology]], [[biomechanics]] and [[engineering]]. Patients who benefit from an orthosis may have a condition such as [[spina bifida]] or [[cerebral palsy]], or have experienced a [[spinal cord injury]] or [[stroke]]. Equally, orthoses are sometimes used prophylactically or to optimise performance in sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Redford|first1=John B.|last2=Basmajian|first2=John V.|last3=Trautman|first3=Paul|title=Orthotics: clinical practice and rehabilitation technology|date=1995|publisher=Churchill Livingstone Inc.|location=New York|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture and materials==
Orthoses were traditionally made by following a tracing of the extremity with measurements to assist in creating a well-fitted device. Subsequently, the advent of [[plastics]] as a material of choice for [[construction]] necessitated the idea of creating a [[plaster of Paris]] mould of the body part in question. This method is still extensively used throughout the industry. Currently, [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]], CNC machines and 3D printing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afootprint.eu/|title=Home - A-Footprint|first=|last=webteam@gcu.ac.uk|date=|website=www.afootprint.eu|accessdate=20 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171221224930/https://www.afootprint.eu/|archivedate=21 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; are involved in orthotic manufacture.

Orthoses are made from various types of materials including [[thermoplastics]], [[carbon fibre]], [[metals]], [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]], [[Ethylene-vinyl acetate|EVA]], fabric or a combination of similar materials. Some designs may be purchased at a local retailer; others are more specific and require a prescription from a [[physician]], who will fit the orthosis according to the [[patient]]'s requirements. [[Over-the-counter]] braces are basic and available in multiple sizes. They are generally slid on or strapped on with [[Velcro]], and are held tightly in place. One of the purposes of these braces is injury protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/0201/p342.html Braces and Splints for musculoskeletal conditions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204001609/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/0201/p342.html |date=4 December 2010 }} American Family Physician. 2010-02-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
[[File:Codification of Orthotics, Draw by Dr. Harry Gouvas.jpg|thumb|Codification of Orthotics|350px]]
Under the International Standard terminology, orthoses are classified by an acronym describing the anatomical joints which they contain.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 8549-3&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an ankle foot orthosis ('AFO') is applied to the foot and ankle, a thoracolumbosacral orthosis ('TLSO') affects the thoracic, lumbar and sacral regions of the spine. It is also useful to describe the function of the orthosis. Use of the International Standard is promoted to reduce the widespread variation in description of orthoses, which is often a barrier to interpretation of research studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |doi=10.3109/03093641003674288 |journal=[[Prosthetics and Orthotics International|Prosthet Orthot Int]] |title=A systematic review to determine best practice reporting guidelines for AFO interventions in studies involving children with cerebral palsy |date=June 2010 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=129–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upper-limb orthoses==
Upper-limb (or upper extremity) orthoses are mechanical or electromechanical devices applied externally to the arm or segments thereof in order to restore or improve function, or structural characteristics of the arm segments encumbered by the device.  In general, musculoskeletal problems that may be alleviated by the use of upper limb orthoses include those resulting from trauma&lt;ref name="Upper Limb Orthotics Overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/314774-overview |title=Upper Limb Orthotics |publisher=eMedicine from WebMD |accessdate=15 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925085754/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/314774-overview |archivedate=25 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or disease (arthritis for example).  They may also be beneficial in aiding individuals who have suffered a neurological impairment such as stroke, spinal cord injury, or peripheral neuropathy.

===Types of upper-limb orthoses===
*Upper-limb orthoses
**Clavicular and shoulder orthoses
**Arm orthoses
**Functional arm orthoses
**Elbow orthoses
*Forearm-wrist orthoses
*Forearm-wrist-thumb orthoses
*Forearm-wrist-hand orthoses
*Hand orthoses
*Upper-extremity orthoses (with special functions)

==Lower-limb orthoses==
A lower-limb orthosis is an external device applied to a lower-body segment to improve function by controlling motion, providing support through stabilizing gait, reducing pain through transferring load to another area, correcting flexible deformities, and preventing progression of fixed deformities.&lt;ref name="Lower Limb Orthotics Overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/314838-overview |title=Lower Limb Orthotics |publisher=eMedicine from WebMD |accessdate=15 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913015856/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/314838-overview |archivedate=13 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''caliper''' or '''calipers''' remains in widespread use for lower-limb orthoses in the United Kingdom.

===Foot orthoses===
{{main|Shoe insert}}
Foot orthoses (commonly called "orthotics") are devices inserted into shoes to provide support for the foot by redistributing ground reaction forces acting on the foot joints while standing, walking or running. They may be either pre-moulded (also called pre-fabricated) or custom made according to a cast or impression of the foot. A great body of information exists within the orthotic literature describing their medical use for people with foot problems as well as the impact "orthotics" can have on foot, knee, hip, and spine deformities.  They are used by everyone from athletes to the elderly to accommodate biomechanical deformities and a variety of soft tissue conditions. Custom-made foot orthoses are effective at reducing pain for people with painful [[Pes cavus | high-arched feet]], and may be effective for people with [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[plantar fasciitis]] or [[hallux valgus]] ("bunions"). For children with [[juvenile idiopathic arthritis]] (JIA) custom-made and pre-fabricated foot orthoses may also reduce foot pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hawke|first1=F|last2=Burns|first2=J|last3=Radford|first3=JA|last4=du Toit|first4=V|title=Custom-made foot orthoses for the treatment of foot pain.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=16 July 2008|issue=3|pages=CD006801|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006801.pub2|pmid=18646168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foot orthoses may also be used in conjunction with properly fitted orthopaedic footwear in the prevention of foot ulcers in the at-risk diabetic foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foot Orthotics|url=http://thefootandlegclinic.co.uk/orthotics/foot-orthotics/|publisher=www.thefootandlegclinic.co.uk|accessdate=24 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315033959/http://thefootandlegclinic.co.uk/orthotics/foot-orthotics/|archivedate=15 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ankle-foot orthosis===
[[File:Ankle Foot Orthosis leg brace worn on the left foot with ankle hinge.jpg|thumb|An AFO worn on the left foot with ankle hinge]]
[[Image:Ankle-foot-orthosis.png|right|thumb|200px|Schematic ankle-foot orthosis]]

An ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) is an orthosis or brace that encumbers the [[ankle]] and foot. AFOs are externally applied and intended to control position and motion of the ankle, compensate for weakness, or correct deformities. AFOs can be used to support weak limbs, or to position a limb with contracted muscles into a more normal position. They are also used to immobilize the ankle and lower leg in the presence of arthritis or fracture, and to correct [[foot drop]]; an AFO is also known as a foot-drop brace.
Ankle-foot orthoses are the most commonly used orthoses, making up about 26% of all orthoses provided in the United States.&lt;ref name="Whiteside"&gt;Whiteside, S., et al. Practice analysis of certified practitioners in the disciplines of orthotics and prosthetics. 2007, American Board for Certification in Orthotics and Prosthetics, Inc., Alexandria, Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a review of Medicare payment data from 2001 to 2006, the base cost of an AFO was about $500 to $700.&lt;ref name="Medicare"&gt;Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, PSPS Files 2001–2006.&lt;/ref&gt; An AFO is generally constructed of lightweight polypropylene-based plastic in the shape of an "L", with the upright portion behind the calf and the lower portion running under the foot. They are attached to the calf with a strap, and are made to fit inside accommodative shoes. The unbroken "L" shape of some designs provides rigidity, while other designs (with a jointed ankle) provide different types of control.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Obtaining a good fit with an AFO involves one of two approaches:
# provision of an off-the-shelf or prefabricated AFO matched in size to the end user
# custom manufacture of an individualized AFO from a positive model, obtained from a negative cast or the use of computer-aided imaging, design, and milling. The plastic used to create a durable AFO must be heated to 400&amp;nbsp;°F (200&amp;nbsp;°C), making direct molding of the material on the end user impossible.
The International Red Cross recognizes four major types of AFOs:
{| class="wikitable"

The International Committee of the Red Cross published its manufacturing guidelines for ankle-foot orthoses in 2006.&lt;ref name="ICRC AFO Manufacturing Guidelines" /&gt;  Its intent is to provide standardized procedures for the manufacture of high-quality modern, durable and economical devices to people with disabilities throughout the world.

=== Ulcer healing orthosis (UHO) ===
A custom-made ankle/foot orthosis for the treatment of patients having plantar ulcers is disclosed, which comprises a rigid L-shaped support member and a rigid anterior support shell hingedly articulated to the L-shaped support member. The plantar portion of the L-shaped member further comprises at least one ulcer-protecting hollow spatially located for fitted placement in inferior adjacency to a user's plantar ulcer, thus allowing the user to transfer the user's weight away from the plantar ulcer and facilitating plantar ulcer treatment. The anterior support shell is designed for lateral hinged attachment to the L-shaped member to take advantage of medial tibial flare structure for enhancing the weight-bearing properties of the disclosed orthosis. A flexible, polyethylene hinge member hingedly attaches the anterior support shell to the L-shaped member and securing straps securely attach the anterior support shell in fixed, weight-bearing relation about the proximal, anterior portion of the user's lower leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Method and apparatus for the treatment of plantar ulcers and foot deformities|date=20 Sep 2005|url=http://www.google.com.pg/patents/US6945946|inventor-last=Rooney|inventor-first=John E.|issue=US6945946 B2|accessdate=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knee-ankle-foot orthosis (KAFOs)===

A knee-ankle-foot orthosis (KAFO) is an orthosis that encumbers the knee, ankle and foot. Motion at all three of these lower limb areas is affected by a KAFO and can include stopping motion, limiting motion, or assisting motion in any or all of the three planes of motion in a human joint: sagittal, coronal, and axial. Mechanical hinges, as well as electrically controlled hinges have been used. Various materials for fabrication of a KAFO include but are not limited to metals, plastics, fabrics, and leather. Conditions that might benefit from the use of a KAFO include paralysis, joint laxity or arthritis, fracture, and others.
Although not as widely used as knee orthoses, KAFOs can make a real difference in the life of a paralyzed person, helping them to walk therapeutically or, in the case of [[poliomyelitis|polio]] patients, on a community level. These devices are expensive and require maintenance. Some research is being done to enhance the design; even NASA helped spearhead the development of a special knee joint for KAFOs.

===Knee orthosis (KO)===
[[File:Orthotics - Knee Brace (36209261475).jpg|thumb|right|Knee brace]]
A knee orthosis (KO) or knee brace is a brace that extends above and below the knee joint and is generally worn to support or align the knee. In the case of diseases causing neurological or muscular impairment of muscles surrounding the knee, a KO can prevent flexion or extension instability of the knee. In the case of conditions affecting the ligaments or cartilage of the knee, a KO can provide stabilization to the knee by replacing the function of these injured or damaged parts. For instance, knee braces can be used to relieve pressure from the part of the knee joint affected by diseases such as [[arthritis]] or [[osteoarthritis]] by realigning the knee joint into valgus or varus.  In this way a KO may help reduce osteoarthritis pain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://mayoclinic.com/health/knee-braces/MY00137| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228194505/http://mayoclinic.com/health/knee-braces/MY00137| archivedate=February 28, 2012| deadurl=yes| title=Knee braces for osteoarthritis| publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, there is no clear evidence to advise people with osteoarthritis of the knee about the most effective orthosis to use or the best approach to rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duivenvoorden|first=Tijs|last2=Brouwer|first2=Reinoud W.|last3=van Raaij|first3=Tom M.|last4=Verhagen|first4=Arianne P.|last5=Verhaar|first5=Jan A.

When used properly, a knee brace may help an individual to stay active by enhancing the position and movement of the knee or reducing pain.

===Prophylactic, functional and rehabilitation braces===
Prophylactic braces are used primarily by athletes participating in contact sports. Evidence about prophylactic knee braces, the ones football linemen wear that are often rigid with a knee hinge, indicates they are ineffective in reducing anterior cruciate ligament tears, but may be helpful in resisting medial and lateral collateral ligament tears.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=[[American Family Physician|Am Fam Physician]] |date=2000 Jan 15 |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=411–418 |title=Knee Braces: Current Evidence and Clinical Recommendations for Their Use |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0115/p411.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714221942/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0115/p411.html |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional braces are designed for use by people who have already experienced a knee injury and need support to recover from it. They are also indicated to help people who are suffering from pain associated with arthritis. They are intended to reduce the rotation of the knee and support stability. They reduce the chance of hyperextension, and increase the agility and strength of the knee. The majority of these are made of elastic. They are the least expensive of all braces and are easily found in a variety of sizes.

Rehabilitation braces are used to limit the movement of the knee in both medial and lateral directions- these braces often have an adjustable range of motion stop potential for limiting flexion and extension following ACL reconstruction. They are primarily used after injury or surgery to immobilize the leg. They are larger in size than other braces, due to their function.

==Spinal orthoses==
[[File:Scoliosis brace.jpg|thumb|right|420px|Two different spinal orthoses used to treat [[scoliosis]]]]
[[Scoliosis]], a condition describing an abnormal curvature of the spine, may in certain cases be treated with spinal orthoses, such as the [[Milwaukee brace]], the [[Boston brace]], and [[Charleston bending brace]]. As this condition develops most commonly in adolescent females who are undergoing their [[Adolescence#Growth spurt|pubertal growth spurt]], compliance with wearing is these orthoses is hampered by the concern these individuals have about changes in appearance and restriction caused by wearing these orthoses.
Spinal orthoses may also be used in the treatment of spinal fractures. A Jewett brace, for instance, may be used to facilitate healing of an anterior wedge fracture involving the T10 to L3 vertebrae. A body jacket may be used to stabilize more involved fractures of the spine. The halo brace is a cervical thoracic orthosis used to immobilize the cervical spine, usually following fracture. The halo brace allows the least cervical motion of all cervical orthoses currently in use; it was first developed by Vernon L. Nickel at [[Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |title=The halo. A spinal skeletal traction fixation device |authors=Nickel VL, Perry J, Garrett A, Heppenstall M |journal=[[Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery|J Bone Joint Surg Am]] |date=1968 Oct |volume=50 |issue=7 |pages=1400–9 |pmid= |doi= |url=http://jbjs.org/content/50/7/1400 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthotists==

Orthotists are healthcare professionals who specialize in the provision of orthoses. In the United States, orthotists work by prescription from a licensed healthcare provider. Physical therapists are not legally authorized to prescribe orthoses in the U.S. In the U.K., orthotists will often accept open referrals for orthotic assessment without a specific prescription from doctors or other healthcare professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hpc-uk.org/assets/documents/10000522Standards_of_Proficiency_Prosthetists_and_Orthotists.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006190500/http://www.hpc-uk.org/assets/documents/10000522Standards_of_Proficiency_Prosthetists_and_Orthotists.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

In Canada, a Certified Orthotist CO(c) provides clinical assessment, treatment plan development, patient management, technical design, and fabrication of custom orthoses to maximize patient outcomes. To become CBCPO certified through Orthotics Prosthetics Canada (OPC) an applicant must successfully meet the following requirements:
- be fluent in French or English; 
- be a Canadian citizen or legal landed immigrant; 
- graduate from an OPC approved post-secondary clinical Prosthetic and Orthotic program; 
- complete a minimum 3450 hours of Residency in Orthotics under the direct supervision of a Canadian certified orthotist; 
- successfully challenge the written, oral and practical national certification exams.

Upon successful completion of the national certification exams, candidates are conferred the designation of Canadian Certified Orthotist CO(c).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opcanada.ca/english/certified-professionals/certified-professionals.html|title=Certified Professionals|author=|date=|website=opcanada.ca|accessdate=20 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321192943/https://opcanada.ca/english/certified-professionals/certified-professionals.html|archivedate=21 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

In the UK orthotists assess patients, and where appropriate design and fit orthoses for any part of the body. Registration is with the [[Health and Care Professions Council]] and BAPO - [https://www.bapo.com The British Association of Prosthetists and Orthotists]. The training is a B.Sc.(Hons) in Prosthetics and Orthotics at either the [[University of Salford]] or [[University of Strathclyde]]. New graduates are therefore eligible to work as an orthotist and/or [[prosthetist]].

Podiatrists are the other profession involved with foot orthotic provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scpod.org/college-aims/careers/scope-of-podiatry/|title=Scope of Podiatry|last=|first=|date=2017-01-25|website=The Scope of Podiatry|publisher=The College of Podiatry|access-date=2017-01-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203022533/http://www.scpod.org/college-aims/careers/scope-of-podiatry/|archivedate=3 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also registered with the [[Health and Care Professions Council]] . Podiatrists assess gait to provide orthotics to improve foot function and alignment or may use orthoses to redistribute stress on pressure areas for those with diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis.

===United States===

A licensed orthotist is an orthotist who is recognized by the particular state in which they are licensed to have met basic standards of proficiency, as determined by examination and experience to adequately and safely contribute to the health of the residents of that state. An American Board of Certification certified orthotist has met certain standards; these include a degree in orthotics, completion of a one-year residency at an approved clinical site, and passing a rigorous three-part exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.podiatryupdates.com/orthotist-and-prosthetist.pdf|title=www.abcop.org – Certification – Orthotist &amp; Prosthetist|author=|date=|website=podiatryupdates.com|accessdate=20 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092907/http://www.podiatryupdates.com/orthotist-and-prosthetist.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A certified orthotist (CO) is an orthotist who has passed the certification standards of the American Board of Certification in Orthotics, Prosthetics and Pedorthics. Other credentialing bodies who are involved in orthotics include the Board for Orthotic Certification, the pharmaceutical industry, the Pedorthic Footcare Association, and various of the professional associations who work with athletic trainers, physical and occupational therapists, and orthopedic technologists/cast technicians.

===Iran===
Four universities including the [[Iran University of Medical Sciences|Iran University of Medical Science]], [[Isfahan University of Medical Sciences|Isfahan University of Medical Science]], [[University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences]] and [[Iran Red Crescent University]] confer bachelor of science in the Prosthetics and Orthotics. Three universities including Isfahan University of Medical Science, the Iran University of Medical Science and University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Science also confer [[M.Sc.]] and [[Ph.D]]. New bachelor graduates are eligible to work as an orthotist and [[prosthetist]] after registration in the [[Medical Council of Iran]].

Founded in 2013, Pakathon aims to create jobs through innovation and entrepreneurship&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/malik-siraj-akbar/pakathon-searching-soluti_b_8248982.html|title=Pakathon: Searching for Solutions Through Business and Technology|last=Akbar|first=Malik Siraj|date=October 6, 2015|work=|access-date=April 5, 2016|via=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; by mobilizing the [[Pakistani diaspora]]. By working to foster a global network of like-minded individuals, investors and entrepreneurs, Pakathon aims to solve problems in sectors such as education, healthcare, gender equality, energy and law.

== Introduction ==
The organization's flagship event is a weekend-long [[hackathon]] hosted in chapter cities where students and professionals develop and pitch their projects to a panel of mentors. Top-performing teams are then invited to present their ideas to a global audience where they compete for funding, mentorship, and additional support, with the aim of advancing their ideas from conception to reality. Two winning teams are then selected: one from Pakistan and another from the international host cities.

In 2015, Pakathon partnered with the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] to expand Pakathon's innovation-centred programming in up to 50 Pakistani universities.

== Impact ==
Pakathon's first winning team conceived the idea for ProCheck, a serialization system for authentic medicines in Pakistan. ProCheck allows customers and patients to verify authentic medicines using their mobile phones via text messaging. In November, 2015 ProCheck partnered with Ferozsons Labs, a leading manufacturer of pharmaceuticals in Pakistan, to serialize 35 million units of medicine using ProCheck's track and trace solution. As a result, more than 50,000 patients across the country will be able to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit medicines.

A '''portmanteau''' is a piece of luggage, usually made of leather and opening into two equal parts. Some were large, upright, and hinged at the back and enabled hanging up clothes in one half,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/portmanteau&lt;/ref&gt; while others are much smaller bags (such as [[Gladstone bag]]s) with two equally sized compartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.achome.co.uk/antiques/vintage_luggage.htm |title=A History of Vintage Luggage |accessdate=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word derives from the French word ''portemanteau'' (from ''porter'', "to carry", and ''manteau'', "coat"),&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/portmanteau&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/portmanteau-new-word&lt;/ref&gt; which nowadays means a coat rack but was in the past also used to refer to a traveling case or bag for clothes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Petit Robert]]: ''portemanteau'' - "malle penderie" (suitcase in which clothes hang)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/portemanteau "portemanteau" in le Trésor de la langue française informatisé (The Digitized Treasury of the French Language)] &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9679">{{Price of Oil}}
The '''posted price''' of oil was the price that oil companies offered to purchase oil from oil-producing governments. This price was set by the oil companies and used to calculate the share of oil revenues that oil producing countries would receive.&lt;ref name=kuiken&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.3366/brw.2015.0165| issn = 2043-8567| volume = 8| issue = 1| pages = 5–26| last = Kuiken| first = Jonathan| title = Striking the Balance: Intervention versus Non-intervention in Britain's Oil Policy, 1957–1970| journal = Britain and the World| accessdate = 2018-06-18| date = 2015-03-01| url = https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/full/10.3366/brw.2015.0165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1957 and 1972, the posted price was greater than the market price of [[crude oil]]. Between 1961 and 1970 the market price hovered between $1.30 and $1.50 per barrel, while the posted price was a constant $1.80.&lt;ref name=ray&gt;{{Cite journal| issue = 82| pages = 59–61| last = G. F. RAY| title = THE 'REAL' PRICE OF CRUDE OIL| journal = National Institute Economic Review| date = 1977| jstor = 23880225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Before [[Standard Oil]] was [[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States|broken up by the United States Supreme Court]] in 1911, they used to "post" the price they were willing to pay for crude oil.&lt;ref name=ray /&gt; Until 1895, crude oil was sold on the exchange at [[Oil City, Pennsylvania]], but in January 1935 the Seep Purchasing Company, which purchased 80% of [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Ohio]]{{'}}s crude oil production for Standard Oil, posted a notice that the price of oil would "be as high as the market of the world will justify, but will not necessarily be the price bill on the exchange for certificate oil".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harper &amp; brothers| last = Montague| first = Gilbert Holland| title = The Rise and Progress of the Standard Oil Company| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lW0hwhByIO8C&amp;pg=PA131 | page=131 |date = 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system continued after 1911 where large buyers would post a fixed buying price.&lt;ref name=ray /&gt; Historically, the posted price in the Middle East, or [[History of the Venezuelan oil industry|Venezuela]] was calculated based on the [[Incoterms#Cost,_Insurance_and_Freight|CIF]] [[Mobil|New York]] price, which was itself based on the [[FOB (shipping)|FOB]] [[Offshore oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico (United States)|Gulf of Mexico]] price. In other words, the posted price in New York was the FOB Gulf of Mexico price plus the cost of freight. Thus, if the posted price per barrel of crude oil was $3.16 in New York, after deducting the freight between New York and [[Kuwait]] ($1.19) and the US tax on oil ($0.11 per barrel), the posted price in Kuwait would be $1.87 per barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 3| issue = 1| pages = 91–107| last = F. A. Hasab| title = THE INTERNATIONAL OIL PRICE MECHANISM| journal = Acta Oeconomica| date = 1968| jstor = 40728253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1950s: Profit-sharing===
By the 1950s, fixed royalty payments had been replaced by 50-50 [[profit sharing]] arrangements following the [[History of the oil industry in Saudi Arabia|1950 ARAMCO deal]].&lt;ref name=parra /&gt; The posted price, sometimes also called the published price, is not the price that is actually received by oil producing governments. This price, historically set by the oil companies and later by [[OPEC]], is used to calculate the taxes and royalties that will be paid to governments under profit-sharing agreements.&lt;ref name=mlr&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 00981818| volume = 98| issue = 11| pages = 36| last1 = Murphy| first1 = Edward E.| last2 = Perez-Lopez| first2 = Jorge F.| title = Trends in U.S. export prices and OPEC oil prices| journal = Monthly Labor Review| accessdate = 2018-06-20| date = 1975| url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;AN=6009420&amp;site=ehost-live |via=[[EBSCOhost]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the posted price as a pricing basis for the 50-50 share agreements varied from country to country; the posted price was not adopted as the basis in Saudi Arabia until 1955, but had been used in [[Iraq]] since the [[Faisal II of Iraq|Iraqi government]]{{'}}s revised [[concession (contract)|agreement]] with the [[Iraqi Petroleum Company]] was negotiated in 1952.&lt;ref name=parra&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = I.B.Tauris| isbn = 978-1-86064-977-6| last = Parra| first = Francisco| title = Oil Politics: A Modern History of Petroleum| chapter=1. Cornerstone Concessions |date = 2004-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OPEC===
After oil companies lowered the posted price, five oil producing countries formed [[OPEC]] in 1960: Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran and Iraq. In 1970 the price of crude oil was still $1.35 and the supply of oil exceeded demand.&lt;ref name=rose&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 58| issue = 3| pages = 424–443| last = Euclid A. Rose| title = OPEC's Dominance of the Global Oil Market: The Rise of the World's Dependency on Oil| journal = Middle East Journal| date = 2004| jstor = 4330033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a decline in value of the [[United States dollar|US dollar]] relative to [[Gold standard|gold]] in 1971, the Tehran Agreement of 1971 was amended to include an 8.49% increase in the posted price of oil. Additionally, the amended agreement further stipulated that every [[Fiscal year|quarter]] the posting price would be adjusted based on an [[Stock market index|index]] that would be calculated by comparing value changes in the currencies of nine major industrialized countries relative to the dollar. However, this indexing arrangement was canceled after the [[1973 oil crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 9| issue = 4| pages = 501–511| last1 = David Hammes| last2 = Douglas Wills| title = Black Gold: The End of Bretton Woods and the Oil-Price Shocks of the 1970s| journal = The Independent Review| date = 2005| jstor = 24562081}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tripoli Agreement of 1971 was signed by the OPEC members who exported across the Mediterranean, rather than through the [[Persian Gulf]] — namely [[Libya]], [[Algeria]] and Iraq; not only did the posted price increase, but the profit sharing arrangement went from 50-50 to 55-45 in favor of the producing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-275-98400-7| last1 = Falola| first1 = Toyin| last2 = Genova| first2 = Ann| title = The Politics of the Global Oil Industry: An Introduction| chapter= 4. OPEC and International Oil Organizations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BXWasJHiT-kC&amp;pg=PA74 |date = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1973 oil crisis, OPEC turned down an offer to increase the posted price by 15%, instead raising it from $3.00 to $5.11 per barrel. Arab oil producers also decided to cut production and [[Economic sanctions|embargo]]ed the United States. Soon after, at a meeting in Tehran in January 1974, OPEC raised the posted price again — this time, to $11.65 per barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/2555476| issn = 07416261| volume = 17| issue = 4| pages = 467| last1 = Smith| first1 = Rodney T.| last2 = Bradley| first2 = Michael| last3 = Jarrell| first3 = Greg| title = Studying Firm-Specific Effects of Regulation with Stock Market Data: An Application to Oil Price Regulation| journal = The RAND Journal of Economics| accessdate = 2018-06-19| date = 1986| url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.2307/2555476}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between the start of the [[Arab-Israeli War of 1973]] and the Tehran meeting the posted price of oil increased four-fold.&lt;ref name=rose /&gt; 

Between 1973 and 1980, the value of exports from Arab oil-producing countries increased from less than $23 billion to $220 billion. Saudi Arabia's exports rose from $8 billion to $108 billion in same time period. The oil-producing countries agreed to return to normal production levels in March 1974, and the price of crude oil "froze" until 1979. Although the posted price in 1978 was $12.70, after calculating for [[inflation]] and currency fluctuations, the [[real price of oil]] purchased with [[Japanese yen]] was $6.67 in 1978, compared to $9.56 in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 6| issue = 1/2,| last = Abbas Alnasrawi| title = The Rise and Fall of Arab Oil Power| journal = Arab Studies Quarterly| jstor = 41857709}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of studies were published in the 1980s that attempted to show [[causality]] between OPEC's the posted price and the market price of oil.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Verleger ( 1982), Fitzgerald and Pollio ( 1984), Lowinger and Ram ( 1984), and Loderer ( 1985);''See also''  Samii, Weiner, and Wirl ( 1989) for discussion of bidirectional causality.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-275-94583-1| last = Shojai| first = Siamack| title = The New Global Oil Market: Understanding Energy Issues in the World Economy| chapter=8.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7539">A '''pyrotechnician''' is a person who is responsible for the safe storage, handling, and functioning of [[pyrotechnics]] and pyrotechnic devices. Although the term is generally used in reference to individuals who operate pyrotechnics in the entertainment industry, it can include all individuals who regularly handle explosives. However, individuals who handle more powerful materials for commercial, demolition, or military applications are generally referred to as explosive technicians.

==Certification==
It is becoming more common in different countries and regions for individuals involved with the storage, handling and operation of pyrotechnics to have some form of license or certification. The specific requirements for certification, along with any restrictions or prohibitions, however, can vary wildly from one jurisdiction to the next. Most jurisdictions do require some type of minimum professional fireworks training before being allowed to apply for certification.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], individuals using, handling or storing pyrotechnics must receive government certification. All individuals must meet certain minimum requirements, including being at least 18 years of age and having received approved training, including working under the direct supervision of a licensed pyrotechnician, before being issued a license. All pyrotechnicians are required to maintain a log of their experience and to submit this log annually during the license renewal process.

There is a push to form a recreational pyrotechnic association, ARPA (Australian Recreational Pyrotechnic Association) that would benefit those who do not wish to shoot professional displays or acquire a professional license and would rather discharge smaller consumer fireworks that do not pose a higher risk as the professional devices. The association still has guidelines and requirements that form part of a safety strategy, but less training and expenses would be the benefit of the association as individuals do not need the training that the professional devices require.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], individuals using, handling or storing pyrotechnics must receive government certification, administered by the Explosives Regulatory Division of [[Natural Resources Canada]]. All individuals must meet certain minimum requirements, including being at least 18 years of age and having received government training, before being issued a license. All pyrotechnicians, of any classification or certification, are required to maintain a log of their experience.   

Certification for the use of proximate (indoor) pyrotechnics in Canada is separate from certification for display [[fireworks]], and different government training and certification must be obtained.

The available licenses for the use of proximate pyrotechnics are sub-divided into one of 6 categories.

====Pyrotechnician====
The Pyrotechnician classification is the primary classification in Canada. Individuals may use a restricted list of pyrotechnics individually, but may fabricate, handle, and set up a broader list of pyrotechnics typically prohibited to the pyrotechnician under the direct supervision of a higher-licensed individual. After two years of verifiable experience with a sufficient assortment of pyrotechnics, pyrotechnicians may apply for advancement to Senior Pyrotechnician certification. Certification is valid for five years.

====Senior Pyrotechnician====
The Senior Pyrotechnician classification is the intermediate classification in Canada. Individuals can supervise other pyrotechnicians and use any pyrotechnic device or product approved for use in Canada, and may also fabricate, handle, and set up a special-purpose or custom-fabricated pyrotechnics typically prohibited while under the direct supervision of a Special Effects Technician. After two years of verifiable experience with a sufficient assortment of pyrotechnics, pyrotechnicians may apply for advancement to Special Effects Technician certification. Certification is valid for five years.

====Special Effects Technician====
The Special Effects Technician classification is the most advanced classification in Canada. Individuals may use any pyrotechnic device or product approved for use in Canada, and may also fabricate, handle, and set up a special-purpose or custom-fabricated pyrotechnics device typically prohibited. A Special Effects Technician may also apply for special certification to use restricted material, such as detonating cord and exploding bolts. Certification is valid for five years.

====Authorities Having Jurisdiction====
Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) are individuals certified by the Explosive Regulatory Division to inspect and approve pyrotechnic events, including members of agencies associated with pyrotechnics such as fire departments and police forces. Unlike other certification classes, Authorities Having Jurisdiction are not required to pay fees to attend training sessions.

====Out-of-Country Technicians====
Pyrotechnicians based outside of Canada participating in the production of a pyrotechnics special effects event in Canada are required to obtain a Visitor Card at either a Pyrotechnician or Special Effects Technician equivalent level. 
A certified Canadian technician of the applicable class must also be employed for the production. Visitor Cards are valid for one year.

Alternately, pyrotechnicians based outside of Canada may apply for Canadian certification, provided they meet the minimum requirements and attend the Explosive Regulatory Division certification training.

===United States===
There is no national certification or licensing requirements for pyrotechnicians in the United States, however, many individual states implement their own certification or licensing programs. Not all states have [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] agreements in regards to honouring another state's certification, so it is not uncommon for pyrotechnicians to have certifications from multiple states. Certain states require certification to store, handle and operate [[fireworks]] but not proximate (indoor) pyrotechnics; other states use the same certification for all pyrotechnics.

Professional pyrotechnic companies typically have licenses issued by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] with regard to manufacturer and distribution of pyrotechnic materials. A special category of driver's license is required for anyone who wishes to transport pyrotechnic materials by vehicle.

[[File:Traffic jam Sao Paulo 09 2006 30.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Traffic congestion]] persists despite [[São Paulo]]'s municipal no-drive days based on license numbers, implemented since 1997. [[São Paulo]] downtown, [[Brazil]].]]
'''Road space rationing''', also known as '''alternate-day travel''', '''driving restriction''', '''no-drive days''', ({{lang-es|restricción vehicular}}; {{lang-pt|rodízio veicular}}; {{lang-fr|circulation alternée}}) is a [[Transportation Demand Management|travel demand management]] strategy aimed to reduce the [[externality|negative externalities]] generated by urban air pollution or peak urban travel demand in excess of available supply or road capacity, through artificially restricting demand (vehicle travel) by [[rationing]] the scarce [[common good (economics)|common good]] road capacity, especially during the peak periods or during peak pollution events. This objective is achieved by restricting traffic access into an urban cordon area, city center (CBD), or district based upon the last digits of the license number on pre-established days and during certain periods, usually, the peak hours.

The practical implementation of this traffic restraint policy is common in Latin America, and in many cases, the road rationing has as a main goal the reduction of air pollution, such as the cases of [[México City]], and [[Santiago (Chile)|Santiago]], [[Chile]]. [[São Paulo]], with a fleet of 6&amp;nbsp;million vehicles in 2007, is the largest metropolis in the world with such a travel restriction, implemented first in 1996 as measured to mitigate air pollution, and thereafter made permanent in 1997 to relieve traffic congestion. More recent implementations in [[Costa Rica]] and [[Honduras]] have had the objective of reducing oil consumption, due to the high impact this import has on the economy of small countries, and considering the steep [[Oil price increases since 2003|increases in oil prices]] that began in 2003. [[Bogotá]], [[Quito]], and  [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]] also have similar driving restriction schemes in place.

After a temporary implementation of road space rationing to reduce air pollution in [[Beijing]] during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], local officials put in place several permanent [[Road space rationing in Beijing|rationing schemes]] to improve the city's air quality. {{As of|2016|06}}, another 11 Chinese cities have similar restriction schemes in place. Also, temporary driving restrictions to reduce cars on the streets by half during severe pollution events have been implemented in [[Paris]] and surrounding suburbs in March 2014, March 2015, and December 2016; in Beijing twice in December 2015, and one more time in December 2016; and also in [[Rome]] and [[Milan]] for several days in December 2015. A similar alternate-day travel temporary scheme was implemented in [[New Delhi]] as a two-week trial in January 2016. A temporary ban on diesel cars was implemented in [[Oslo]] on municipal roads in January 2017.

==Historical background==

The earliest known implementation of road space rationing took place in [[Rome]], as [[carriage]]s and [[cart]]s pulled by horses created serious congestion problems in several Roman cities. In 45&amp;nbsp;B.C. [[Julius Caesar]] declared the center of Rome off-limits between 6&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 4&amp;nbsp;p.m. to all vehicles except for carriages transporting priests, officials, visitors, and high-ranking citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Black|first=William R.|title =Sustainable Transportation: Problems and Solutions|year=2010|publisher=[[The Guilford Press]]|isbn =978-1-60623-485-3|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==

Schemes rationing access based on number plate have mixed results. If used infrequently or temporarily the alternate-day travel policy can have some impact. However, if used as a long term measure, inequality issues might arise, as wealthier people can afford to own two cars with opposite-parity number plates, to circumvent any restrictions, with the second vehicle being often older and therefore more polluting.&lt;ref name=Viegas2001/&gt; Cities such as [[Tehran]] which have used such schemes are now looking to more sustainable methods of traffic and emissions control,&lt;ref name="tehran"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.tehran.ir/Default.aspx?tabid=77&amp;smid=415&amp;ArticleID=6841|publisher=en.tehran.ir|title=Tehran’s low-emission zone rule gets green light|accessdate=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[low emission zone]] or traffic limited zones as used in Europe.&lt;ref name="urbanaccessregulations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanaccessregulations.eu/|publisher=urbanaccessregulations.eu|title=urban access regulations|accessdate=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access regulations have often been found to be effective, in reducing congestion, traffic and pollution.&lt;ref name="urbanaccessregulations2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanaccessregulations.eu/userhome/general-overview#Impacts|publisher=urbanaccessregulations.eu|title=Overview of website|accessdate=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Road space rationing based on license numbers has been implemented in cities such as [[Athens]] (1982),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leda.ils.nrw.de/database/measures/meas0205.htm|title=LEDA Measure: License plate based traffic restrictions, Athens, Greece|publisher=LEDA database|accessdate=2008-04-09|language=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227030125/http://www.leda.ils.nrw.de/database/measures/meas0205.htm|archivedate=2008-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]] (1986 and extended 2001), [[México City]] (1989), [[Metro Manila]] (1995), [[São Paulo]] (1997), [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]] (1998),  [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]] (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boliviahoy.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=3150 | title=Los choferes públicos acataron la restricción | date=2003-01-07 | publisher=La Prensa | accessdate=2008-04-09 | language=Spanish | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213053528/http://www.boliviahoy.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=3150 | archive-date=2006-12-13 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[San José de Costa Rica|San José]], [[Costa Rica]], (2005)&lt;ref name=LN082005/&gt;&lt;ref name=LN062008/&gt; countrywide in [[Honduras]] (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2008/abril/07/mundo1488835.html | title=Unos 39.000 vehículos dejan de circular en Honduras para ahorrar petróleo | date=2007-04-07 | publisher=La Nación | accessdate=2008-04-09 | language=Spanish | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411001222/http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2008/abril/07/mundo1488835.html | archivedate=2008-04-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]] (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/desde-marzo-se-aplicaria-el-pico-y-placa-en-la-capital-386893.html|publisher=Diario Hoy|title=Desde marzo se aplica el pico y placa en la capital|language=Spanish|date=2010-01-10|accessdate=2010-04-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100508065600/http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/desde-marzo-se-aplicaria-el-pico-y-placa-en-la-capital-386893.html|archivedate=2010-05-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these cities restrain a percentage of vehicles every weekday during rush hours or for the entire day. When the restriction is based in two digits a theoretical 20% reduction of traffic is expected. Cities with serious air quality problems, such as [[México City]] and [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]] use more digits to achieve greater reductions in air pollution, and even the prohibition can be for more than one day a week. In [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]] from 2009 the plate restriction was extended from peak periods to the whole day (from 06:00 to 20:00 hours) in the whole city.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[Bertrand Delanoë]], the mayor of Paris, proposed to impose a complete ban on motor vehicles in the city's inner districts, with exemptions only for residents, businesses, and the disabled, as a three-part plan to implement during a seven-year period.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news | first = Jon | last = Henley | title = Paris drive to cut traffic in centre by 75% | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/15/france.jonhenley | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = Guardian Media Group

During the discussions regarding the proposal to introduce [[New York congestion pricing|congestion pricing in New York]], the commission created in 2007 by the New York State Legislature to evaluate other traffic relief options, considered road space rationing based on license plates as an alternative to [[congestion pricing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = William Neuman | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/25/nyregion/25pricing.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|date = 2008-01-25 | title = Traffic Panel Members Expecto to Endorse Fees on Cars | publisher = The New York Times|accessdate=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal stalled in April 2008 as the legislature decided not to vote the proposed plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/08/nyregion/08congest.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=6327902f9d5026b0&amp;ex=1365393600&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |author= Nicholas Confessore |date=2008-04-08 | title=$8 Traffic Fee for Manhattan Gets Nowhere  | publisher = The New York Times | accessdate = 2008-04-08 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Athens ====
{{main article|Dactylius}}
Rising traffic in Athens during the 90s' led to the development of the [[Dactylius]] (Greek: Δακτύλιος, meaning ring) around central Athens. The Dactylius does not require drivers to pay in order to enter the areas subjected to the Dactylius' restrictions. Instead, the scheme depends on the [[Parity (mathematics)|parity]] of the date and of the vehicle's registration plate, the vehicle type as well as the time of the week/month. There are three Dactylius areas: The Inner, the Outer and the Green, each one with its own policies.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

====Bogotá====
{{Main article|Pico y placa}}

Then mayor [[Enrique Peñalosa]], introduced in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]] in 1998 a driving restriction program, "Pico y placa" (literally in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: "peak and license plate") to reduce [[traffic congestion]] during [[rush hour]]s.&lt;ref name=Decree1998&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/sisjur/normas/Norma1.jsp?i=1937|title=Decreto 626 de 1998 Alcalde Mayor|language=Spanish|trans-title=Major's Decree 626 of 1998|publisher= Alcaldía Mayor de Bogotá D.C.|date=1998-07-15|accessdate=2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system restricts traffic access into a pre-established urban area for vehicles with [[license plate]] numbers ending in certain digits on pre-established days and during certain hours based on the last digit of the licence plate numbers. Initially the system restricted traffic between 7:00 - 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. and between 5:30 - 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., Monday through Friday, for two days for each registered vehicle.&lt;ref name=Decree1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=EE062012/&gt;

Then mayor [[Antanas Mockus]] extended the restriction for one hour in 2001. A complementary program called "El Pico y Placa Ambiental"  (literally in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: "environmental peak and license plate") was implemented by then mayor [[Luis Eduardo Garzón]] in 2006, expanding the restriction to public transportation vehicles, including both bus and taxi services.&lt;ref name=EE062012&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/bogota/pico-y-placa-marca-petro-articulo-352807 |title=Pico y Placa marca Petro

Since 2002 Bogotá's scheme switched the combinations of days and numbers every year, making it harder to circumvent the restriction by buying another car.&lt;ref name=Guardian032014/&gt;

Starting in February 2009, then mayor [[Samuel Moreno Rojas]] extended the restriction from 6&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 8&amp;nbsp;p.m., Monday through Friday. This extension was issued as a temporary measure until public works related with the [[Transmilenio|Transmilenio BRT]] were completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/bogota/pico-y-placa-sera-todo-el-dia-para-particulares-en-bogota-a-partir-del-6-de-febrero_4773160-1|title=Pico y placa será todo el día para particulares en Bogotá, a partir del 6 de febrero|language=Spanish|trans-title="Pico y Placa" will be extended to all day for passenger vehicles in Bogotá, beginning February 6|author=Staff|work=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)]]|date=2009-01-24|accessdate=2016-01-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308092610/http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/bogota/pico-y-placa-sera-todo-el-dia-para-particulares-en-bogota-a-partir-del-6-de-febrero_4773160-1|archivedate=2012-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, then mayor [[Gustavo Petro]] reduced the hours of the restriction from 14 to 7 hours per day, to restrict access only between 6:00- 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. and between 3:00 - 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. In addition, five neighborhoods were released from the restriction, [[Usme]], [[Rafael Uribe Uribe (Bogotá)|Rafael Uribe Uribe]], [[Tunjuelito]], [[San Cristóbal (Bogotá)|San Cristóbal]] and [[Ciudad Bolívar (Bogotá)|Ciudad Bolívar]]. Also, under the modified scheme five ending numbers are restricted every day between Monday and Friday, license plated ending on odd-numbers are restricted on odd-days of the month, and even-numbers on even-days.&lt;ref name=EE062012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://guiatramitesyservicios.bogota.gov.co/portel/libreria/php/frame_detalle_scv.php?h_id=26490|title=Restricción para vehículos de servicio particular - SDM|language=Spanish|trans-title=Restriction for private vehicles|author=Secretaría Distrital de Movilidad|publisher=Alcaldía de Bogotá|date=2015-10-29|accessdate=2016-01-02}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since December 2014, exempted vehicles include passenger cars with three or more passengers including the driver; properly registered vehicles for use by [[disability|people with disabilities]]; [[all-electric vehicle]]s; emergency vehicles, such police cars, ambulances, and fire trucks; properly identified public utilities vehicles, traffic control and towing vehicles; [[school bus]]es; motorcycles; [[cash-in-transit]] armored vehicles; [[Hearse|funeral vehicles]]; and press, judiciary, diplomatic, presidential motorcade, and security scort vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/sisjur/normas/Norma1.jsp?i=55963 |title=Decreto 575 de 2013 Alcalde Mayor |language=Spanish|trans-title=Major's Decree 575 of 2013|publisher=Alcaldía de Bogotá |date=2014-12-18|accessdate=2016-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar schemes with the same name have been implemented in several Colombian cities, including [[Armenia, Antioquia|Armenia]], [[Barranquilla]], [[Bucaramanga]], [[Cali]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Manizales]], [[Medellín]], and [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

====Mexico City====
{{Main article|Hoy No Circula|l1= Hoy no Circula (Mexico City)}}

[[Mexico City]] started in November 1989 its driving restriction program, "Hoy no Circula" (literally in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: "today [your car] does not circulate", known as "No-drive days"), which consisted of prohibiting the circulation of 20% of vehicles from Monday to Friday depending on the last digit of their license plates. Record levels of [[Ozone#Ozone air pollution|ozone]] and other [[airborne pollutants]] led the city government to implement the scheme.&lt;ref name=Guardian032014&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/mar/20/licence-plate-driving-bans-paris-ineffective-air-pollution |title=Why licence plate bans don't cut smog |author=Karl Mathiesen |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2014-03-20|accessdate=2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UM2008/&gt; The program was planned to apply only during the winter, when air pollution is at its worst. Winter follows the rainy season when [[inversion (meteorology)|thermal inversion]], an atmospheric condition which traps smog and pollution close to the ground, increases air pollution noticeably. However, the program was made permanent at the end of the 1990 winter season.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

[[File:AerialViewPhotochemicalSmogMexicoCity 2.jpg|thumb|Severe smog over [[Mexico City]].]]

The program is intended to improve the [[air quality]] of Mexico City. The restriction is based on the last digit of the license plate. Two numbers are restricted to travel every day between from 5&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 10&amp;nbsp;p.m. The restrictions apply to the entire Mexico City metropolitan area, therefore, a similar coordinated program operates within the [[México (state)|State of México]], including the 18 neighboring municipalities which surrounds Mexico City on three sides: [[Atizapán de Zaragoza]], [[Coacalco de Berriozabal]], [[Cuautitlán]], [[Cuautitlán Izcalli]], [[Chalco de Díaz Covarrubias|Chalco]], [[Chimalhuacan]], [[Chicoloapan]], [[Ecatepec de Morelos]], [[Huixquilucan]], [[Ixtapaluca]], [[La Paz, State of Mexico|La Paz]], [[Naucalpan de Juárez]], [[Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl|Nezahualcóyotl]], [[Ciudad Nicolás Romero|Nicolás Romero]], [[Tecámac]], [[Tlalnepantla de Baz]], [[Tultitlán]] and [[Valle de Chalco Solidaridad]].&lt;ref name=UM2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.milenio.com/monterrey/descarta-aplicar-programa-Hoy-circula_0_657534268.html |title=Estado descarta aplicar programa Hoy no circula |author=Orlando Maldonado|work=[[Milenio]]|date=2016-01-02|accessdate=2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoy No Circula is coupled with an exhaust monitoring program, known as "Verificación" in Spanish (verification), whereby a car's pollutant emissions are analyzed every six months.

The driving restriction program was initially successful in reducing pollution levels, as [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) fell by 11%. Compliance with the program is near universal. However, as the restriction was made permanent residents began buying second cars to get around the ban, usually used and old polluting cars. A 2008 study from the [[University of Michigan]] found that there is no evidence that the restrictions have improved air quality. Evidence from additional sources indicates that the restrictions led to an increase in the total number of vehicles in circulation and the long-term impact of the scheme on CO levels has been a 13% rise.&lt;ref name=Guardian032014/&gt;&lt;ref name=UM2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://instructional1.calstatela.edu/mfinney/Courses/433/articles/mexico_program.pdf |title=The Effect of Driving Restrictions on Air Quality in Mexico City |author=Lucas W.

====San José====

An alternate-day travel scheme was introduced in [[San José, Costa Rica]], in August 2005. The goal of the restriction program was to reduced oil consumption with the purpose of mitigating the negative effects of [[2000s energy crisis|high international oil prices]] in the Costa Rican economy. The program was implemented when the price of an [[oil barrel]] was at {{USD|65}} up from {{USD|20}} in early 2003. Fuel and oil imports represented in 2007 a 5.6% of the country's [[GDP]], up from 2% ten years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2007/noviembre/29/economia1333130.html|title= Factura petrolera costará más de $1.400 millones|language=Spanish|trans-title=Oil bill will cost more than US$1.4 billion | author= Mercedes Aguero | date=2007-11-29 | work=[[La Nación (San José)]]| accessdate=2008-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011094438/http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2007/noviembre/29/economia1333130.html |archive-date=2008-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Santiago====
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}

Drving restrictions were introduced in [[Santiago]] in 1986, as a measure to mitigate [[Chile]]'s capital high levels of air pollution. The scheme is based on the last number of the license plate, and two number are banned from entering the city between Monday and Friday.

Initially the restriction applied only to passenger vehicles without a [[catalytic converter]] with the aim to reduced [[particulate matter]] emissions. During critical air pollution events, classified as alert, pre-emergency or emergency, the number of cars restricted to travel are increased by adding additional last number plates. Beginning with pre-emergency state, the restriction might include vehicles with catalytic converter. As the number of registered vehicles with the emission control device surpassed those without it, authorities decided in 2008 to increase the number of vehicles restricted to enter every day to the city, by increasing the restricction to the four last digits instead of the initial two. This scheme produces a theoritical reduction of 40% of vehicles entering the city on a work day.

==== Jakarta ====
The no-drive day in Jakarta is known as ''Ganjil Genap'' (even and odd [days] in Indonesian). This policy imitates what has been done in Beijing during Olympics. Policeman checks license plate's last digit on the entrance of avenue or expressway. A car with even license plate (for example B 1000 LA, obsolete plate of [[Idris Sardi]] car) is allowed to pass in "even days", but will be fined when they pass that road in "odd days".

In 2018, license plate checking also applied on expressways bound to Jakarta suburban area ([[Jabodetabek]]). License plates are checked in [[Toll road|toll booths]] [[Bekasi]], Cibubur (border of Jakarta and [[Depok]]) and [[Tangerang]]. Only overcrowded toll booths apply this ban. Existing ''Ganjil Genap'' in Jakarta was extended from 6am starts from 23 April 2018.

[[File:Beijing Forbidden City Smog.jpg|thumb|Smog over [[Beijing]]'s [[Forbidden City]].]]

Temporary driving restrictions were imposed in [[Beijing]] from December 8 to 10, 2015, as part of the smog mitigation measures provided for in Beijing’s red alert for hazardous smog, the first such alert issued ever. The smog alert system was put in place in 2013, and a red alert should go into effect if there is a prediction that the [[air quality index]] will stay over 200 for more than 72 hours. On the evening of December 7 the index was 253 according to Beijing’s authorities. Under a red alert half of the city’s cars are ordered off the streets through a temporary alternate-day travel scheme based on the [[Odd–even rationing|cars' license plate numbers]]. Only cars with even-numbered license plates were allowed on the roads during the first day of the restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2015/12/07/beijing-issues-first-ever-red-alert-for-hazardous-smog/ |title=Beijing Issues First-Ever Red Alert for Hazardous Smog|author=Te-Ping Chen |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=2015-12-07|accessdate=2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/08/world/asia/beijing-pollution-red-alert.html?_r=0 |title=Beijing Issues Red Alert Over Air Pollution for the First Time |author=Edward Wong |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2015-12-07|accessdate=2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electric car]]s are not subject to the driving restriction, as a government incentive to promote the use of [[green vehicle|cleaner vehicles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/beijing-traffic-cut-schools-closed-due-pollution-red-035635673.html |title=Beijing slashes traffic in pollution red alert |author=Benjamin Dooley |work=Agence France-Presse |publisher=[[Yahoo!

According to the [[Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Environmental Protection]], the combined effect of all the restrictions imposed reduced pollutant emissions in Beijing by 30% during day one of the city's first red alert for smog. Environmentalist from [[Beijing University of Technology]] estimated that without the measures, the density of [[Particulates|PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;]] would have risen by 10% in that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-12/09/content_22675510.htm |title=Red alert cuts Beijing emissions by 30% |work=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |publisher=[[China Daily]]|date=2015-12-12|accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second red alert for pollution was issued on December 18, 2015.

On 16 December 2016, Beijing authorities declared a five-day pollution “red alert” due to a heavy pollution event. Among other measures, about half the cars were restricted through a temporary alternate-day travel scheme, and older and “dirty” high-emissions vehicles were forbidden to circulate. Public transport services in the city were increased, with about 3,600 buses on duty. The Ministry of Environmental Protection reported that 21 other cities across north and central China had also declared pollution red alerts, including [[Tianjin]], [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Taiyuan]], and [[Zhengzhou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/17/beijing-smog-pollution-red-alert-declared-in-china-capital-and-21-other-cities | title=Beijing smog: pollution red alert declared in China capital and 21 other cities | first=Tom | last=Phillips | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=2016-12-17 | accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-12/20/c_135919635.htm | title=China Focus: A city sighs as Beijing's heavy smog continues | publisher= Xinhua English News | work=[[Xinhua]] | date=2016-12-20 | accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The red alert was lifted on 22 December 2016 as the winds cleared pollution away the night before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://in.reuters.com/article/china-pollution-idINKBN14B07S | title=Blue skies return to Beijing as wind clears dangerous pollution

====Italy====

In December 2015, several Italian cities implemented temporary driving restrictions due to severe air pollution levels. The restrictions were issued in [[Rome]], [[Milan]] and other cities in the [[Lombardy]] region, including [[Pavia]], [[Buccinasco]], [[Cesano Boscone]], [[Cernusco sul Naviglio]], [[Bresso]], [[Cinisello Balsamo]], [[Cormano]], [[Corsico]], [[Cusano Milanino]], [[Paderno Dugnano]] and [[Sesto San Giovanni]].&lt;ref name=BBC122015&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35188685 |title=Italy smog: Milan and Rome ban cars as pollution rises|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2015-12-28|accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ilpost122015&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ilpost.it/2015/12/28/blocco-auto-come-funziona-targhe-alterne-milano-roma/ |title=Guida al blocco del traffico a Milano e Roma |language=Italian|trans-title=Guide to restrict traffic in Milan and Rome |author=Daniele Mascolo|publisher=Ilpost.it|work=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata]] (ANSA)|date=2015-12-28|accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy had the most pollution-related deaths in Europe in 2012. Over 84,000 people in the country died prematurely owing to bad air quality, according to the European Environment Agency (EEA).&lt;ref name=BBC122015/&gt;

=====Milan=====

[[File:Settimo Milanese visto da sud.jpg|thumb|Severe smog over [[Milan]] seem from a neighboring town.]]

Milan was named as Europe's most polluted city in 2008 and remains among the worst on the continent. City officials have limited traffic on several occasions since 2007 to curb bad air quality.&lt;ref name=BBC122015/&gt; Due to record high air pollution levels, Milanese authorities ban cars, motorcycles and scooters for six hours a day, between 10&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 4&amp;nbsp;p.m. for three days during the last week of December 2015. Local authorities introduced a special "anti-smog" all-day public transport ticket for {{euro|1.50}} (~{{USD|1.65}}).&lt;ref name=BBC122015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ilpost122015/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT122015/&gt; Neighboring towns and municipalities in the [[Lombardy]] region, including [[Pavia]], [[Cinisello Balsamo]], [[Paderno Dugnano]], and [[Sesto San Giovanni]], also implemented the temporary driving restriction.&lt;ref name=Ilpost122015/&gt; [[Electric vehicle]]s and [[carsharing]] cars are exempted from the ban.&lt;ref name=Ilpost122015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.internazionale.it/notizie/2015/12/28/milano-roma-traffico-blocco|title=Come funzionano le limitazioni del traffico a Milano e a Roma|language=Italian|trans-title=How Traffic Restriction Works in Milan and Rome |author=Staff|work=Internazionale.it|date=2015-12-28|accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Rome=====

An alternate-day travel scheme was implemented in Rome to curb severe air pollution in the city, which has high concentrations of [[particulate matter]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]]. The scheme was in force for several days during the last two weeks of December 2015. The driving restriction is based on the last digits of license plate numbers and was implemented for a total of nine hours, from 7:30 to 12:30 and 16:30 until 20:30. To promote ridership by public transportation, {{euro|1.50}} (~{{USD|1.65}}) single-ride transit tickets became passes valid all day. [[Environmentally friendly vehicle]]s, such as [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrids]] and [[natural gas vehicle]]s are exempt from the restriction. The most polluting vehicles, such as gasoline-powered cars compliant with [[European emission standards|Euro 0 and 1 standards]], and diesel cars up to Euro 2, can not enter the city independently of the number plate. Rome authorities resorted to limit traffic in the city on several occasions during the fall of 2015 due to high air pollution.&lt;ref name=BBC122015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ilpost122015/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT122015&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/25/world/europe/italy-air-pollution.html?ref=europe&amp;_r=0 |title=Italy, Dirty Air at Record Levels, Is Putting Limits on Traffic|author=Gaia Pianigiani|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2015-12-24|accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Oslo ====
[[File:Traffic in Oslo.JPG|thumb|A ban on diesel-powered cars from municipal roads was implemented in [[Oslo]] on 17 January 2017.]]

In January 2017 a combination of cold, still winter weather and poor air quality prompted [[Oslo]] city authorities to ban diesel-powered cars from municipal roads to combat rising air pollution for at least two days. The ban did not apply on the national motorways. This was the first time ever Oslo implemented a ban of this type after the city council agreed on the use of such a measure in February 2016. The diesel ban went into effect from 6 a.m. until 10.p.m on 17 January 2017, and motorists violating the ban were fined 1,500 kroner (~ {{USD|180}}).&lt;ref name=NorskBan1&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/16/oslo-temporarily-bans-diesel-cars-combat-pollution |title=Oslo temporarily bans diesel cars to combat pollution | author=[[Agence France-Presse]] | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=2017-01-16 | accessdate=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NorskBan2&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2017/01/16/diesel-vehicles-fined-in-oslo-tomorrow/ |title=Diesel ban extended, no fines issued yet | first= Nina |last=Berglund | work=News in English Norway | date=2017-01-16 | accessdate=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temporary ban scheduled for 18 January was lifted after officials said the weather forecast indicated that higher altitude winds would clear the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thelocal.no/20170118/oslo-lifts-temporary-ban-on-diesel-vehicles |title=Oslo lifts temporary ban on diesel vehicles

The restriction did not apply to heavy vehicles with [[Euro VI]] technology, gasoline-powered cars, [[electric car]]s and [[plug-in hybrid]] vehicles, emergency vehicles, goods transport, diplomatic vehicles, handicap transport, public service vehicles, and cars carrying a patient to a doctor appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dinside.no/motor/dieselbilforbud-det-stinker-av/66639711 |title=Dieselbilforbud det stinker av |language=Norwegian |trans-title=Diesel ban stinks |first=Espen |last=Stensrud | work=Dinside.no | date=2017-01-16 |accessdate=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The restriction angered some motorists, who were encouraged by Norwegian authorities in 2006 to opt for diesel vehicles, which at the time were considered a better environmental choice than gasoline-powered cars.&lt;ref name=NorskBan1/&gt;&lt;ref name=NorskBan2/&gt;

==== Paris ====
[[File:Air pollution Paris over Seine cropped.jpg|thumb|Traffic was restricted in [[Paris]] in March 2014 due to a peak in the levels of [[particulate matter]].]]

On March 17, 2014, a partial driving restriction was imposed in [[Paris]] and its inner suburbs based on license plate numbers. The measure was issued by the city government in order to mitigate a peak in air pollution, caused by [[particulate matter]] (PM 10) attributable to vehicle emissions. Cars with even-numbered license plates and commercial vehicles over 3.5 tons were banned from entering the city from 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. until midnight. [[Electric car|Electric]] and [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid cars]], [[natural gas vehicle|natural gas-powered vehicles]] and [[carpool]]s with three or more passengers were exempted. Only once before this type of restriction had been implemented in the city for one day in 1997. The week before the traffic restriction was imposed, the government also reduced speed limits around Paris by {{Convert|20|km|abbr=on}} per hour, provided all [[public transportation]] for free, and the short-term subscriptions of the [[Vélib]] [[bikesharing]] program, and the first hour of the [[Autolib]] [[carsharing]] service were free. The measure was not extended to the following day due to the improvement of air quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/world/europe/fighting-pollution-paris-imposes-partial-driving-ban.html?hpw&amp;rref=science&amp;action=click&amp;module=Search%C2%AEion=searchResults%230&amp;version=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%23%2Fparis%2520pollution%2F&amp;_r=1|title=Fighting Pollution, Paris Imposes Partial Driving Ban|author=Scott Sayare|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2014-03-17|accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2014/03/15/01016-20140315ARTFIG00091-pollution-la-meteo-devrait-ameliorer-la-situation-ce-week-end.php|title=Pollution : circulation alternée lundi matin à Paris et dans la petite couronne |language=French|trans-title=Pollution: traffic restriction on Monday morning in Paris and the inner suburbs |author=[[Agence France-Presse]]|work=[[Le Figaro]]|date=2014-03-17|accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Delhi====

According to the [[World Health Organization]], in 2014, New Delhi had the most polluted air of about 1,600 cities the organization tracked around the world. According to India's [[Central Pollution Control Board]], the city's air pollution had been in the severe category on nearly three-quarter of the days in November 2015. The [[Delhi High Court]] asked the government to take action to curb air pollution on 30 November 2015.&lt;ref name=Delhi122015/&gt;

On July 20, 2008, [[Beijing]] implemented a temporary road space rationing scheme based on plate numbers in order to significantly improve air quality in the city during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7515907.stm|title=Car restrictions begin in Beijing | date=2008-07-20 | publisher= BBC News | accessdate=2008-07-25 | language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/world/asia/15china.html?hp|title=Traffic Beijing Stops Construction for Olympics | author= Andrew Jacobs | date=2008-04-14 | publisher= [[New York Times]] | accessdate=2008-04-14 | language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enforcement was carried out through an automated traffic surveillance network.

====Post-Olympics permanent rule====
{{Main article|Road space rationing in Beijing}}

The driving restriction during the Olympics was so successful in cleaning the air and relieving [[traffic congestion]], that a modified version of the scheme was made permanent afterward in October 2008, now banning 20% of the vehicles on a given weekday instead of half the vehicles as implemented during the Olympics.&lt;ref name=NYT1009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/28/content_10126448.htm|title=Post-Olympics Beijing car restrictions to take effect next month|publisher=China View news|date=2008-09-28|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also a ban on heavy trucks from entering the city during the day was implemented, and the oldest most polluting  automobiles, called "yellow-label" cars, after the sticker fixed to their windshields, are banned from entering the city center. In July 2009 a nationwide car [[scrappage program]] was implemented offering rebates for trade in old heavy polluting cars and trucks for new ones.&lt;ref name=NYT1009&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/17/world/asia/17beijing.html?_r=1&amp;hpw|title=Beijing's Air Is Cleaner, but Far From Clean|publisher=[[New York Times]]|author=Michael Wines|date=2009-10-16|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016|06}}, in addition to Beijing, another 11 Chinese cities have similar restriction schemes in place.&lt;ref name=China2016&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21700676-chinese-love-their-cars-do-not-want-pay-more-driving-them-great-crawl?frsc=dg%7Ca | title=The great crawl | work=[[The Economist]] | date=2016-06-18 | accessdate=2016-06-22}} From the print edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

This severe policy has been publicized as the "First Car-free Olympics". During the peak events, the Olympics expect a crowd of 800,000 people. Those attending will have to travel by [[public transport]], mainly through the [[London Underground|Underground]], or by bicycle or on foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/10/31/london-2012-olympics-the-first-to-be-car-free/ |title=London 2012 Olympics the first to be "car-free" |publisher= AutoBlogGreen|date=2007-10-31|accessdate=2008-04-10|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar management and rationing policies ==

===Congestion pricing===
{{Further information|Congestion pricing}}
Transport economists consider road space rationing a variation of [[road pricing]], and an alternative to [[congestion pricing]], but road space rationing is considered more equitable by some, as the restrictions force all drivers to reduce auto travel, while congestion pricing restrains less those who can afford paying the congestion charge. Nevertheless, high-income users can often avoid the restrictions by owning a second car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Victoria Transport Policy Institute| url=http://www.vtpi.org/tdm/tdm33.htm |title=Vehicle Restrictions. Limiting Automobile Travel At Certain Times and Places |publisher= TDM Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-04-09|language= }} See Equity Impacts section&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, congestion pricing (unlike rationing) acts "to allocate a scarce resource to its most valuable use, as evinced by users' willingness to pay for the resource". While some "opponents of congestion pricing fear that tolled roads will be used only by people with high income. But preliminary evidence suggests that the new toll lanes in California are used by people of all income groups. The ability to get somewhere fast and reliably is valued in a variety of circumstances. Not everyone will need or want to incur a toll on a daily basis, but on occasions when getting somewhere quickly is necessary, the option of paying to save time is valuable to people at all income levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Holtz-Eakin, Douglas |date=2003-05-06 |url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdoc.cfm?index=4197 |title=Congestion Pricing for Highways (Testimony before the Joint Economic Committee, U.S. Congress) |accessdate=2008-02-26 |publisher=Congressional Budget Office |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214064914/http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdoc.cfm?index=4197 |archivedate=2008-02-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobility rights or congestion credits===
A more recent idea for automobile travel restrictions, proposed by some transport economists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |vauthors=Verhoef E, Nijkamp P, Rietveld P | url = http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/b240527 | year = 1997 | title = Tradeable permits: their potential in the regulation of road transport externalities | publisher = Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design 24(4) 527 – 548 |accessdate=2018-09-09  |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to avoid inequality and revenue allocation issues, is to implement a [[rationing]] of peak period travel but through revenue-neutral credit-based [[congestion pricing]]. This concept is similar to the existing system of  [[emissions trading]] of [[carbon credit]]s, proposed by the [[Kyoto Protocol]] to curb [[greenhouse emissions]]. Metropolitan area or city residents, or the taxpayers, will have the option to use the local government-issued mobility rights or congestion credits for themselves, or to trade or sell them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond the personal quota. This trading system will allow direct benefits to be accrued by those users shifting to public transportation or by those reducing their peak-hour travel rather than the government.&lt;ref name=Viegas2001&gt;{{Cite web | author = José M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7131">The Shell '''Scotford Upgrader''' is an oilsand [[upgrader]], a facility which processes crude [[bitumen]] (extra-heavy crude oil) from [[oil sands]] into a wide range of [[synthetic crude]] oils. The upgrader is owned by [[Athabasca Oil Sands Project]] (AOSP), a joint venture of [[Shell Canada|Shell Canada Energy]] (60%), [[Marathon Oil|Marathon Oil Sands L.P.]] (20%) and [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron Canada Limited]] (20%).  The facility is located in the industrial development of [[Scotford, Alberta|Scotford]], just to the northeast of [[Fort Saskatchewan]], [[Alberta]] in the [[Edmonton Capital Region]].&lt;ref name=downstream1&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.downstreamtoday.com/News/Articles/200711/Shell_Repairs_Underway_at_Scotford_Upgr_7233.aspx | title = Shell: Repairs Underway at Scotford Upgrader After Gas Leak | publisher = Downstream Today |date = 2007-11-20 | accessdate = 2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Site==
The Scotford Upgrader is a part of a larger site known as Shell Scotford located 40&amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Edmonton, Alberta]]. Shell Scotford comprises three operating units: the Upgrader, a Refinery, and a Chemical plant.  The [[Scotford Cogeneration Plant]] is also located on the site. Currently, work is being done on the first Upgrader expansion. In 1984, Shell opened both the Refinery and Chemical plant on the Scotford site. As one of North America's most modern and efficient refineries, the Scotford Refinery was the first to exclusively process synthetic crude oil from Alberta’s oil sands. Benzene that is produced during the refining process is sent to the adjacent Chemical plant and is used in the production of Styrene Monomer, a chemical needed to make many of the hard plastics people use daily. In 2000, a glycols plant was opened at Scotford Chemicals. Much of the output of the Scotford Upgrader is sold to the Scotford Refinery. Both light and heavy crudes are also sold to Shell's Sarnia Refinery in Ontario. The rest of the synthetic crude is sold to the general marketplace.

==History of Scotford==

In 1891, a group of immigrants from Galicia, Austria settled on the land south of the North Saskatchewan River, near the South Victoria Trail. Philip Krebs, along with his son John, settled on the north side of South Victoria Trail. Their home became a popular stopping place for those travelling along the trail. Besides being a hospitable natured man, John was fluent in four European languages (German, English, Polish, and Ukrainian) and could speak Cree - making him popular with those who stopped by. 

When the Canadian Northern Railway was being built into Fort Saskatchewan, Philip Krebs’ homestead was a natural place for a stop. In 1905, a loading station was erected there, and on the siding of the building was the name “'''Scotford'''” (named after ''Walter Scott'' and ''Alexander Rutherford'', the premiers of the two provinces – Saskatchewan and Alberta - that were formed that same year). The area is still referred to by that name.

==Description==
The Scotford Upgrader has a rated processing capacity of {{convert|255000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}, but has at times pumped out more than {{convert|200000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=upstream2&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article135258.ece | title = Athabasca 'may produce 1 million bpd' | newspaper = [[Upstream (newspaper)|Upstream Online]] | publisher = NHST Media Group |date = 2007-06-12 | accessdate = 2008-01-03 | id = {{subscription required}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was shut down after being damaged in a fire 19 November 2007. The production was resumed in December 2007.&lt;ref name=upstream1&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article146377.ece | title = Shell digging again at Athabasca | newspaper = [[Upstream (newspaper)|Upstream Online]] | publisher = NHST Media Group |date = 2007-11-23 | accessdate = 2008-01-03 | id = {{subscription required}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility uses hydrogen addition to convert the bitumen from Shell's [[Albian Sands|Muskeg River Mine]] in the [[Athabasca Oil Sands| Athabasca oil sands]] into refinery-ready sweet, light [[crude oil]]. The Muskeg River Mine is the first commercial unit using Shell's ''Enhance'' froth treatment technology — a process for removing sand, fine clay and water from oil sands froth to make clean bitumen suitable for upgrading via hydrogen addition.&lt;ref name=downstream2&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.downstreamtoday.com/News/Articles/200611/Shell_Canada_Announces_Innovation_in_Oil_263.aspx | title = Shell Canada Announces Innovation in Oil Sands Processing | publisher = Downstream Today |date = 2006-11-21 | accessdate = 2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Shell, the [[hydrogenation]] process is well suited to the very clean bitumen produced at the Muskeg River Mine, and results in the upgrader producing more light crude oil than it inputs in the form of heavy bitumen. It also produces lower levels of [[sulfur dioxide]] emissions than the alternative coking method which removes carbon to produce [[petroleum coke]] as a by-product. The Scotford Upgrader has its own [[hydrogen production|hydrogen manufacturing]] unit and produces most of the [[hydrogen]] required for the hydrogen-addition process.

The Scotford Upgrader capacity was expanded by {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} by March 2010, an increase of 60% in capacity. In May 2007, the US$9 billion to US$11.3 billion expansion contract was awarded to TIC, Bantrel Constructors, PCL &amp; [[KBR (company)|KBR]]. KBR built 160 modules and performed construction work for the Atmospheric and Vacuum (A&amp;V) unit and Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU). Bantrel completed the tank farm, Utilities, Waterblock and Flare units, PCL completed the Residue Hydroconversion Complex (RHC) and TIC constructed the Hydrogen Manufacturing Unit (HMU) .&lt;ref name=upstream3&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article133473.ece | title = KBR wins giant Athabasca contract | newspaper = [[Upstream (newspaper)|Upstream Online]] | publisher = NHST Media Group |date = 2007-05-14 | accessdate = 2008-01-03 | id = {{subscription required}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sense on Cents was launched in January 2009. With close to 1 million visitors in three plus years, Doyle's writing emphasizes  investor education and protection with regard to the economy, markets, and finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senseoncents.com/about/ |title=About |publisher=Sense on Cents |date= |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the blog, Doyle covers an extensive array of topics and writes in a style which is understandable for those with little to no financial/market experience to graduate level professors. He has addressed at length the scam embedded in auction-rate securities. Doyle referred to the marketing and distribution by Wall Street of [[auction-rate securities]] as "the single greatest fraud ever perpetrated on investors".&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;  He has also raised questions about Wall Street's self-regulatory organization, the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA), in the blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2010/08/10/preview-finra-faces-calls-lift-veil-finances-pay/ |title=FINRA faces calls to lift veil on finances, pay |publisher=Fox Business |author=Joseph A. Giannone |date=April 7, 2010 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doyle's writing at ''Sense on Cents'' has led to his first book, ''In Bed with Wall Street: The Conspiracy Crippling Our Global Economy'', to be published by [[Palgrave Macmillan]] in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senseoncents.com/in-bed-with-wall-street/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Doyle previously worked in the mortgage business, starting in 1983, for [[First Boston]] (as a [[mortgage-backed securities]] trader), [[Bear Stearns]] (where he was a senior managing director), and [[Union Bank of Switzerland]] (where he was head of mortgage trading), [[Bank of America]], and [[JP Morgan Chase]], where he was the National Sales Manager for Securitized Products.&lt;ref name="pottstownmercury1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/06/08/new-banking-rules-have-not-hurt-jamie-dimon/?section=magazines_fortune |title=New banking rules have not hurt Jamie Dimon - Term Sheet |publisher=Fortune.cnn.com |author= Larry Doyle|date=June 8, 2011 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctpost.com/business/article/Business-People-Kramer-joins-ENT-and-Allergy-600184.php |title=Business People: Kramer joins ENT and Allergy Associates |publisher=Connecticut Post |date=August 2, 2010 |author=Richard Lee |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Signal/One''' was a manufacturer of high performance [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]] and [[Continuous wave|CW]] [[High frequency|HF]] radio communications [[transceiver]]s initially based in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[Florida]], United States.  [[Image:sigcx7.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Signal/One Model CX-7 circa 1970. Price when new: US$2395]]

== History ==

Signal/One's parent company was Electronic Communications, Inc. (ECI), a military division of [[NCR Corporation]] located in St. Petersburg, [[Florida]]. Key Signal/One executives were general manager Dick Ehrhorn ([[amateur radio call signs|amateur radio call sign]] W4ETO), and project engineer Don Fowler (W4YET). Beginning in the 1960s with the Signal/One CX7, ("S1", as they were called) the company made radios that were priced well above the competition and offered many advanced features for the time,&lt;ref name="wa3key"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drechsel|first1=Norman|title=Virtual Signal/One Radio Museum. Signal/One Amateur Equipment|url=http://www.wa3key.com/sigone.html|website=wa3key.com|publisher=WA3KEY|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[passband]] tuning, [[broadband]] transmission, dual receive, built-in [[Telegraph key|IAMBIC]] keyer, electronic digital read out, [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] design, QSK and RF clipping.  A Signal/One radio was said to be a complete high performance, station in a box.&lt;ref name="wa3key"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K5OG"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffmann|first=Fred|title=Signal One|url=http://www.signalone.org/|website=Signalone.org|publisher=K50G|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tenny"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tenny, Jr.|first1=T.H.|title=The signal/one integrated station|journal=[[Ham Radio (magazine)|Ham Radio Magazine]]|date=May 1969|volume=2|issue=5|page=56|url=http://cahabatechnology.com/aa4pg/hrmag/hamradiomag/Ham%20Radio%20Magazine%201969%20Issues%201-12/05%20May%201969.pdf|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While marketed to the affluent radio amateur, it has been suggested that the primary market for Signal/One, like [[Collins Radio|Collins]], was military, State Department, and government communications. Although prized for the performance and advanced engineering, Signal/One's products did not sell as well as hoped, and the company gradually fell on hard times. From the 1970s though the 1990s, every few years, Signal/One was [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]], sold, and resurfaced at another location.&lt;ref name="wa3key"/&gt;

== Collectors ==

The surviving Signal/One products are sought after and actively collected.&lt;ref name="K5OG"/&gt; These include the CX7, CX7A, CX7B, CX11 and Milspec models.  The last Signal/One radio was a re-engineered ICOM IC-781. Information available indicates there were 1152 Signal Ones built: 850 CX7, 112 CX11, 168 MS1030 (number of "C" versions is not known), 6 MilSpec1030C, 15 MilSpec1030CI Icom IC-781 conversions and 1 Milspec1030E DSP Icom IC-756 Pro conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Signal/One|url=http://rigreference.com/en/mfr/signal-one|website=Rig Reference|publisher=RigReference.com|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American Military Engineers emblem.jpg|250px|thumb|right|American Military Engineers]]

Founded in 1920, the '''Society of American Military Engineers''' (SAME) unites public and private sector individuals and organizations from across the architecture, engineering, construction, environmental, facility management, contracting and acquisition fields and related disciplines in support of the United States' national security.&lt;ref&gt;website SAME: http://www.same.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

SAME connects architects, engineers and builders in the public sector and private industry, uniting them to improve individual and collective capabilities to provide the capability and prepare for and overcome natural and man-made disasters, acts of terrorism and to improve security at home and abroad. 

That goal grew from the United States' experiences in [[World War I]] in which more than 11,000 civilian engineers were called to duty upon the US entering the conflict. Returning home after "[[the war to end war]]," many feared the sector would lose this collective knowledge and the cooperation between public and private sectors that proved vital to combat success. Industry and military leaders vowed to capitalize on the technical lessons and camaraderie shared during their battlefield experiences. 

In 1919, [[William Murray Black|Maj. Gen. William M. Black, USA]], the Army's Chief of Engineers, appointed a nine-officer board to consider the formation of an "association of engineers" that would preserve, and expand upon, connections formed in war and promote the advancement of engineering and its related professions. Early in 1920, the first SAME posts were established, providing former colleagues and new engineers opportunities to connect face-to-face, and establishing post-to-community relationships across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.same.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4372 Past Presidents of the Society of American Military Engineers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013211623/http://www.same.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4372 |date=2008-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original nine-member board appointed by Maj. Gen. Black also arranged the donation of ''Professional Memoirs'', a magazine published by the Engineer Bureau since 1909, and its assets, to SAME with the blessing of [[John J. Pershing|Gen. John J. "Blackjack" Pershing]], USA. Those memoirs were subsequently renamed ''The Military Engineer'', which has been continuously published since it debuted in 1920.

U.S. Vice President [[Charles G. Dawes]] served as SAME's 8th president. The year before assuming his role as president of SAME, Dawes was awarded the 1925 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work on German reparations in 1924.

Due to its close ties with the [[uniformed services of the United States]], several branches of the military and the [[Public Health Service]] allow its members to wear the SAME ribbon on the uniform after all military and foreign decorations and awards.  

Headquartered in Alexandria, Va., SAME provides its more than 30,000 members extensive opportunities for training, education and professional development through a robust offering of conferences, workshops, networking events and publications. With a membership that includes recent service academy graduates and retired engineering officers, project managers and corporate executives, uniformed and public sector professionals and private sector experts, SAME bridges the gaps between critical stakeholders to help secure our nation.

SAME consists of 105 Posts and more than 50 Student Chapters and Field Chapters around the world along with a headquarters staff. Nationally, the organization is led by a volunteer Board of Direction that comprises five National Officers, 17 Regional Vice Presidents, the Chairs of the Mission Committees &amp; Councils and 12 Elected Directors who serve three-year terms and are elected in groups of four annually.

SAME membership is open to anyone in the U.S. and abroad.

'''Temenos AG''' (SWX: TEMN) is a company specialising in [[enterprise software]] for banks and [[financial services]], with its headquarters in [[Geneva|Geneva, Switzerland]].  Temenos was initially created in 1993, and has been listed on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange|Swiss Stock exchange]] since 2001.

==Company profile==
Founded in 1993 and listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange (SIX: TEMN), Temenos AG is a provider of [[banking software]] systems to retail, corporate, universal, private, Islamic, microfinance and community banks. Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and with 63 offices in 42 countries, Temenos serves over 3,000 financial institutions in 145 countries across the world.&lt;ref name="temenos-report2017"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.temenos.com/globalassets/abt/ir/rep/2017-interim/temenos-interim-report-2017.pdf |publisher=temenos.com|title= REAL-WORLD FINTECH: Interim Report 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wwd"/&gt; It claims to be used by 41 of the top 50 banks worldwide.&lt;ref name="wwd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="temenos-report2017"/&gt;

==History==
The company was started in November 1993, by George Koukis having acquired the rights to GLOBUS, the successful [[banking software]] platform developed by a team of technical and banking experts in 1988. The company was Temenos, in reference to a lecture on Money given by Hans-Wolfgang Frick at the Temenos Academy&lt;ref name="temenosacademy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.temenosacademy.org/temenos_list_publications.html|title=Temenos Academy Publications catalogue|website=www.temenosacademy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1992), and continued to develop and market GLOBUS.

In 2001, Temenos went public&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.temenos.com/en/about-temenos/investor-relations/investor-faqs/|title=Investor FAQs|website=Temenos|language=en|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and is listed on the main segment of the SWX Swiss Exchange (TEMN). Also in 2001, Temenos acquired a mainframe [[core banking]] application aimed at high-end retail banks, originally developed by [[IBM]], and now marketed as Temenos Corebanking.

On the 30th September 2003 Temenos launched T24.  T24 was based on GLOBUS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wikibanking.info/2012/08/modules-list/|title=Temenos Globus / T24 Banking Package « WIKIBANKING dot INFO|website=www.wikibanking.info|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but with a state of the art banking technology platform.  This is the result of 3 years of development effort and an investment of more than USD 24 million.

In 2011, George Koukis stepped down as [[Chairman]] and became a [[Non-executive director]],&lt;ref name="temenos-ceo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.temenos.com/Press-Releases/2011/Temenos-Group-announces-CEO-and-Chairman-succession-plans/|title=Temenos Group announces CEO and Chairman succession plans|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=16 February 2011|website=temenos.com|publisher=Temenos Headquarters SA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504065751/http://temenos.com/Press-Releases/2011/Temenos-Group-announces-CEO-and-Chairman-succession-plans/|archive-date=4 May 2012|dead-url=yes|access-date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Andreas Andreades became Chairman.

The {{nihongo|'''Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology'''|産業技術記念館|Sangyo-Gijutsu Kinenkan}}, also known as '''Toyota Tecno Museum''', is a technology museum located in [[Nishi-ku, Nagoya|Nishi-ku]] in the city of [[Nagoya]], central [[Japan]].

== History ==
Toyota started as a textile firm and evolved over decades into an international automobile producer. The museum was established in June, 1994 and is housed in an old red-brick textile factory. Its display starts with textile looms and then gradually goes over into the history of cars. Also featured are high-tech [[robot]]s.

Access by public transport is [[Sako Station]] on the [[Meitetsu]] line or [[Kamejima Station]] by the [[Higashiyama Line]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21931">A '''virtual learning environment ''' ('''VLE''') in [[educational technology]] is a [[Web-based]] platform for the digital aspects of courses of study, usually within educational institutions. They present resources, activities and interactions within a course structure and provide for the different stages of assessment. VLEs also usually report on participation; and have some level of integration with other institutional systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/jtap/jtap-041.pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140709094115/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/jtap/jtap-041.pdf|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 9 July 2014|title = A Framework for Pedagogical Evaluation of Virtual Learning Environments|last = Britain|first = Sandy|last2 = Liber|first2 = Oleg|date = 1999|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = 1 February 2015|publisher = |issue = Report 41|series = JISC Technology Applications Programme|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Virtual learning environments: using, choosing and developing your VLE|last = Weller|first = Martin|publisher = Routledge|year = 2007|isbn = 9780415414302|location = London|pages = 4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==

The following are the main components required for the best virtual learning  [[learning environment]] or online education curriculum to take place.

VLE learning platforms commonly allow:{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} 
*Content management – creation, storage, access to and use of learning resources
*Curriculum mapping and planning – lesson planning, assessment and personalisation of the learning experience
*Learner engagement and administration – managed access to learner information and resources and tracking of progress and achievement
*Communication and collaboration – emails, notices, chat, wikis, blogs
*Real time communication – live video conferencing or audio conferencing

A VLE may include some or all of the following elements:
* The course [[syllabus]]
* Administrative information about the course: prerequisites, credits, registration, payments, physical sessions, and contact information for the instructor.
* A notice board for current information about the ongoing course
* The basic content of some or all of the course; the complete course for [[distance learning]] applications, or some part of it, when used as a portion of a conventional course. This normally includes material such as copies of lecture in the form of text, audio, or video presentations, and the supporting visual presentations
* Additional resources, either integrated or as links to outside resources. This typically consists of supplementary reading, or innovative equivalents for it.
* [[Self-assessment]] quizzes or analogous devices, normally scored automatically
* Formal assessment functions, such as examinations, essay submission, or presentation of projects. This now frequently includes components to support [[peer assessment]]
* Support for communications, including [[e-mail]], [[threaded discussion]]s, [[chat room]]s, [[Twitter]] and other media, sometimes with the instructor or an assistant acting as [[Forum moderator|moderator]]. Additional elements include [[wiki]]s, [[blog]]s, [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] and 3D virtual learning spaces.
* Links to outside sources – pathways to all other online learning spaces are linked via the VLE (Virtual Learning Environment).
* Management of [[access control|access rights]] for instructors, their assistants, course support staff, and students
* Documentation and statistics as required for institutional administration and [[quality control]]
* Authoring tools for creating the necessary documents by the instructor, and, usually, submissions by the students
* Provision for the necessary hyperlinks to create a unified presentation to the students.
* Interactive online whiteboard for live virtual classes

A VLE is normally not designed for a specific course or subject, but is capable of supporting multiple courses over the full range of the academic program, giving a consistent interface within the institution and—to some degree—with other institutions using the system. The virtual learning environment supports the worldwide exchange of information between a user and the learning institute he or she is currently enrolled in through digital mediums like e-mail, chat rooms, web 2.0 sites or a forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Online communication between home and school. Case study: Improving the usability of the Unikum e-service in the primary schools of Tierp municipality | author=Safa Naser Husain | year=2012 | publisher=Department of Informatics and Media | url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:603927/FULLTEXT01.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student accessibility features===

One of the processes to enhance the learning experience was the virtual resource room, which is student centered, works in a self-paced format, and which encourages students to take responsibility for their own learning. In virtual mode, the materials are available in the form of computer aided learning program, lecture notes, special self-assessment module. Another mechanism for student to student interactions in a form of simple discussion forum is by using a novel link cyber tutor. This allows the students with an email account to connect with course content and the staff with their doubts and related questions. The students are able to contact the staff without a face to face visit which saves the on campus time. The staff remains anonymous which allows for the several staff to act as a cyber tutor during the course. The student do not remain anonymous although their email address are cryptic enough to mask their identity. Students can discuss about the exams, lab reports, posters, lectures, technical help with downloading materials. The evaluation of the use of Virtual resource room is done by surveys, focus groups and online feedback forms. The students have 24 hours of access to the learning material in a day which suits their life styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peat|first1=Mary|title=Towards First Year Biology online: a virtual learning environment|journal=Educational Technology &amp; Society|date=July 2000|volume=3|issue=3|pages=203–207|jstor=jeductechsoci.3.3.203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xu|first1=Yan|last2=Park|first2=Hyungsung|last3=Baek|first3=Youngkyun|title=A New Approach Toward Digital Storytelling: An Activity Focused on Writing Self-efficacy in a Virtual Learning Environment|journal=Educational Technology &amp; Society|date=October 2011|volume=14|issue=4|pages=181–191|jstor=jeductechsoci.14.4.181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar terms==
Computerized learning systems have been referred to as electronic [[educational technology]], e-learning, learning platform or [[learning management system]]. The major difference is that  VLE and LMS are applications, whereas the Learning Platform shares characteristics with an [[Operating System]] where different educational web-based applications can be run on the platform.

The terms virtual learning environment (VLE) and learning platform are generically used to describe a range of integrated web-based applications that provide teachers, learners, parents and others involved in education with information, tools and resources to support and enhance educational delivery and management. These terms are broadly synonymous with 'managed learning environments' (MLEs) and 'managed virtual learning environments' (MVLEs).

The applications that form part of these online services can include web pages, email, message boards and discussion forums, text and video conferencing, shared diaries, online social areas, as well as assessment, management and tracking tools.&lt;ref name=JISC2007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/programme_buildmle_hefe/mle_lifelonglearning_info/mle_briefingpack/mle_briefings_1.aspx |title=Briefing Paper 1: MLEs and VLEs Explained | publisher=JISC |date=2007 |accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term learning platform refers to a range of tools and services often described using terms such as educational extranet, VLE, [[Learning management system|LMS]], ILMS and LCMS providing learning and [[content management]]. The term learning platform also includes the [[Personal Learning Environment|personal learning environment]] (PLE) or personal online [[learning space]] (POLS), including tools and systems that allow the development and management of eportfolios.
 
The specific functionality associated with any implementation of a learning platform will vary depending upon the needs of the users and can be achieved by bringing together a range of features from different software solutions either commercially available, [[Open-source learning|open source]], self-built or available as free to use web services. These tools are delivered together via a cohesive user environment with a single entry point, through integration achieved by technical standards.

* a [[learning management system]] (LMS). Related concepts include [[content management system]] (CMS), which properly refers to the organization of the educational or other content, not the overall environment; learning content management system (LCMS), which is more often used for corporate training systems than for systems in education institutions; managed learning environment (MLE), which normally refers to the overall infrastructure in an institution of which the VLE is a component, learning support system (LSS); online learning centre (OLC); or [[learning platform]] (LP), education via [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC); or [[online education]]. The term "virtual learning environment" is more commonly used in Europe and Asia, while the synonymous term "learning management system" is the more common usage in North America.

The term LMS can also mean "library management system" (which is now more commonly referred to as [[integrated library system]], or ILS).

==Justification==
{{tone|section|date=September 2018}}
Middle School and High School use VLEs in order to:

* Increase academic performance in order to meet standards to graduate.
* Address the diverse learning needs of all students with digital curriculum.
* Personalize learning to better meet the needs of all students including underachieving and accelerated learners.
* Equip administrators, teachers, and students with the real-time progress and performance to make informed decisions to track success.*

Institutions of higher and [[further education]] use VLEs in order to:

* [[Economize]] on the time of teaching staff, and the cost of instruction.
* Facilitate the presentation of online learning by instructors without web authoring experience.
* Provide instruction to students in a flexible manner to students with varying time and location constraints.
* Provide instruction in a manner familiar to the current web-oriented generation of students.
* Facilitate the networking of instruction between different campuses or even colleges.
* Provide for the reuse of common material among different courses.
* Provide automatic integration of the results of student learning into campus information systems.
* Provide the ability to deliver various courses to a large number of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/technology-and-tools-for-online-learning/virtual-learning-environments|title=Virtual learning environments (VLE)|website=Jisc|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online learners performed modestly better, on average, than those learning the same material through traditional face-to-face instruction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; VLEs are able to provide opportunities for relations between learners by the use of discussion forums. Through this, e-learning helps eliminate barriers that have the potential of hindering participation including the fear of talking to other learners.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ijern.com/journal/2014/December-2014/34.pdf|title=The role of E-learning, the advantages and, disadvantages.|last=Abiadoo|first=N|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can compensate for scarcities of academic staff, including instructors or teachers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Controversy ==
VLEs are supposed to support many [[21st century skills]], including:
* [[cultural awareness|Cultural]] and [[global awareness]]: Students have access to a wide network of people and information.
* [[Self-direction]]: Students are able to work at their own pace.
* [[Information and communication technology]] literacy: Students use technology to obtain and present information.
* [[Problem solving]] skills: Students are required to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in order to be assessed, and they often participate in [[group thinking]] and discussion.
* [[Time management]]: Students are required to meet deadlines.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.swdsi.org/swdsi2010/sw2010_preceedings/papers/pa126.pdf|title = Advantages and Disadvantages of the Virtual Classroom and the Role of the Teacher|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last1 = Posey |first1 = Guy |last2 = Burgess |first2 = Thomas |last3 = Eason |first3 = Marcus |last4 = Jones |first4 = Yawna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both supporters and critics of virtual learning environments recognize the importance of the development of such skills, including [[creativity]], communication, and knowledge application;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Online learning environments in higher education: Connectivism vs. dissociation|last = Reese|first = Sasha|date = September 2015|journal = Education Information Technology|doi = 10.1007/s10639-013-9303-7|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the controversy lies in whether or not virtual learning environments are practical for both teachers and students.

Critics of VLE worry about the disconnect that can occur between the teacher and students, as well as between student to student. Virtual Learning Environments does not provide students with face-to-face interaction and therefore, can deprive students of opportunities for better communication and deeper understanding.  Educators also have concerns pertaining to a student's computer literacy skills and access to quality technology. Both can create a challenge for students to succeed in a Virtual Learning Environment. A study among Indian students has suggested that a negative experience with virtual learning environments can leave "the learner with a passive, un-engaging experience, leading to incomplete learning and low performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com.egcc.ohionet.org/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cph&amp;AN=118585057&amp;site=eds-live|title=Investigating the interrelation between attitudes, learning readiness, and learning styles under virtual learning environment: a study among Indian students.|last=Jena|first=R.K.|date=2006|website=EBSCO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The VLE leads to a reported higher computer self-efficacy, while participants report being less satisfied with the learning process that is achieved in the Virtual Learning Environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3250989?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|title=Web-Based Virtual Learning Environments: A Research Framework and a Preliminary Assessment of Effectiveness in Basic IT Skills Training|last1=Piccoli|first1=Gabriele|last2=Ahmad|first2=Rami|last3=Ives|first3=Blake|date=December 2001|journal=MIS Quarterly|volume=25|issue=4|pages=401-426|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards==
Most VLEs support the [[SCORM|Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM)]] as a standard, but there are no commonly used standards that define how the learner's performance within a course can be transferred from one VLE to another.

There are also standards for sharing content such as those defined by the IMS Global Consortium. Local bodies such as in the schools sector in the UK the [[DCSF]] via Becta have additionally defined a learning platform "conformance framework" to encourage interoperability.

Virtual learning environments are not limited only to students and learners in university level studies. There are many virtual learning environments for students in grades K-12. These systems are also particularly suited for the needs of independent educational programs, charter schools and home-based education.

As virtual teaching and learning becomes more deeply integrated into curricula, it is important to assess the quality and rigor of virtual programs. The Virtual Learning Program Standards provide a framework for identifying key areas for effective teaching and learning in Virtual Learning Programs throughout the Northeast and the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, C. (April 2014). Virtual Learning Rubric. Retrieved from http://www.doe.mass.edu/odl/standards/VLPrubric.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessments ==
Educators need benchmark tools to assess a virtual learning environment as a viable means of education.

Walker developed a survey instrument known as the [[Distance Education Learning Environments Survey|Distance Education Learning Environment Survey]] (DELES), which is accessible to students anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Walker | first = S | year = 2003 | title = Development and Validation of an Instrument for Assessing Distance Education Learning Environments in Higher Education: The Distance Education Learning Environments Survey (DELES) | format = unpublished doctoral thesis | publisher = Curtin University of Technology | place = Western Australia | url = http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=14269&amp;local_base=GEN01-ERA02}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  DELES examines instructor support, student interaction and collaboration, personal relevance, authentic learning, active learning, and student autonomy.

Harnish and Reeves provide a systematic criteria approach based on training, implementation, system usage, communication, and support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Harnish | first1 = D | last2 = Reeves | first2 = P | year = 2000 | title = Issues in the evaluation of large-scale two-way interactive distance learning systems | journal = International Journal of Educational Telecommunications | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 267–81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
