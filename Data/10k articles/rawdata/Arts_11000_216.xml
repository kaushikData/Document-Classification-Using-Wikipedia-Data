'''Fashion in the period 1795–1820''' in [[Europe]]an and European-influenced countries saw the final triumph of undress or informal styles over the [[brocade]]s, [[lace]], [[wig|periwig]]s and powder of the earlier [[1700–50 in Western fashion|18th century]]. In the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]], no one wanted to appear to be a member of the French [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]], and people began using clothing more as a form of individual expression of the true self than as a pure indication of social status.&lt;ref&gt;Aaslestad, Katherine B.: "Sitten und Mode: Fashion, Gender, and Public Identities in Hamburg at the Turn of the Nineteenth Century, Gender in Transition: Discourse and Practice in German-Speaking Europe, University of Michigan Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the shifts that occurred in fashion at the turn of the 19th century granted the opportunity to present new public identities that also provided insights into their private selves. Katherine Aaslestad indicates how "fashion, embodying new social values, emerged as a key site of confrontation between tradition and change."&lt;ref&gt;Aaslestad, Katherine B.: "Sitten und Mode: Fashion, Gender, and Public Identities in Hamburg at the Turn of the Nineteenth Century, Gender in Transition: Discourse and Practice in German-Speaking Europe, University of Michigan Press, 2006, 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

For women's dress, the day to day outfit of the skirt and jacket style were practical and tactful, recalling the working class woman.&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro, Aileen: The Art of Dress: Fashion in England and France 1750–1820, Yale University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-300-06287-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's fashions followed [[Classicism|classical]] ideals, and tightly laced [[corset]]s were temporarily abandoned in favor of a high-waisted, natural figure.&lt;ref&gt;Four Hundred Years of Fashion, Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, V&amp;A Publications, 1984 p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; This natural figure was emphasized by being able to see the body beneath the clothing. Visible breasts were part of this classical look, and some characterized the breasts in fashion as solely aesthetic and sexual.&lt;ref&gt;Yalom, Marilyn, "A History of the Breast." (Knopf: New York, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain|Britain]], the era of Regency in England covered the years when King George III was deemed unfit to rule and his son, the Prince of Wales ruled England as Prince Regent before his accession as King George IV. But the broadest definition of the period, characterized by trends in fashion, architecture, culture, and politics, begins with the French Revolution of 1789 and ends with Queen Victoria’s rise to power. The names of popular persons who lived in this time are still famous: Napoleon I Bonaparte and Josephine, Madame Recamier, Jane Austen, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, Beau Brummell, Lady Emma Hamilton, Queen Louise of Prussia and her husband and many more. [[Beau Brummell]] introduced [[trousers]], perfect [[tailor]]ing, and unadorned, immaculate [[linen]] as the ideals of men's fashion. 

In [[Germany]], republican city-states relinquished their traditional, modest, and practical garments and started to embrace the French and English fashion trends of short-sleeved chemise dresses and Spencer jackets.&lt;ref name="Aaslestad, Katherine B. 2006"&gt;Aaslestad, Katherine B.: "Sitten und Mode: Fashion, Gender, and Public Identities in Hamburg at the Turn of the Nineteenth Century, Gender in Transition: Discourse and Practice in German-Speaking Europe, University of Michigan Press, 2006, 282-318.&lt;/ref&gt; American fashion trends emulated French dress, but in a toned down manner with shawls and tunics to cope with the sheerness of the chemise.&lt;ref&gt;Low, Betty-Bright P., “Of Muslins and Merveilleuses,” Winterthur Portfolio, vol 9 (1974), 29-75.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[Spain]], members of the Aristocracy, as well as citizens of the lower class, united and rebelled against French enlightenment ideals and fashion by dressing as majas and [[majo]]s to contain their Spanish pride.&lt;ref&gt;Noyes, Dorothy: "La Maja Vestida: Dress as Resistance to Enlightenment in Late 18th-century Madrid," Journal of American Folklore, vol 111, no 440, 1998, 197-217.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the eighteenth century, a major shift in fashion was taking place that extended beyond changes in mere style to changes in philosophical and social ideals. Prior to this time, the style and traditions of the “[[Ancien Régime]]” prevented the conceptualization of “the self”. Instead, one's identity was considered malleable; subject to change depending on what clothes one was wearing. However, by the 1780s, the new, “natural” style allowed one's inner self to transcend their clothes.&lt;ref name="Dror Warman 2004 pp. 166-189"&gt;Dror Warman, The Making of the Modern Self: Identity and Culture in Eighteenth-Century England (Yale University Press, 2004), pp. 166-189, 265-278&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1790s, there was a new concept of the internal and external self. Before this time, there had only been one self, which was expressed through clothing. When going to a masquerade ball, people wore specific clothing, so they could not show their individuality through their clothing. &lt;ref name="Dror Warman 2004 pp. 166-189"/&gt; Incorporated in this new “natural” style was the importance of ease and comfort of one's dress. Not only was there a new emphasis on hygiene, but also clothing became much lighter and more able to be changed and washed frequently. Even upper class women began wearing cropped dresses as opposed to dresses with long trains or hoops that restricted them from leaving their homes. The subsequent near stasis of the silhouette inspired volumes of new trims and details on heavily trimmed skirts back into fashion. In the Regency years, complicated historic and orientalist elements provided lavish stylistic displays as such details were a vigorous vehicle for conspicuous consumption given their labor-intensive fabrications, and therefore a potent signifier of hierarchy for the upper classes who wore the styles.  This kind of statement was particularly noticeable in profuse trimmings, especially on skirts where unrestrained details were common, along with cut edge details and edge trims. 

Women's fashion was also influenced by male fashion, such as tailored waistcoats and jackets to emphasize women's mobility. This new movement toward practicality of dress showed that dress became less of a way to solely categorize between classes or genders; dress was meant to suit one's personal daily routine.&lt;ref&gt;Peter McNeil, "The Appearance of Enlightenment: Refashioning the Elites," in The Enlightenment Worlds, eds (Routledge, 2004), pp. 381-400&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during this time period that the fashion magazine and journal industry began to take off. They were most often monthly (often competing) periodicals that allowed men and women to keep up with the ever-changing styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The|first=Elizabeth Roslyn|title=Women’s Fashion: Fashion Plates, Illustrations, and Watercolours from 1790s to 1810s.|url=http://barbauldfashion.wordpress.com/2013/04/07/fashion/|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence of Industrial Revolution on fashion ==
[[File:Fashion Plate (The Russian and Prussian Bonnet and Pelisse) LACMA M.86.266.183.jpg|thumb|left|Fashion Plate (The Russian &amp; Prussian Bonnet &amp; Pelisse), published in ''[[La Belle Assemblée]]'', July 1, 1814]]

In the late 18th century, clothes were mostly sold by individual shopkeepers who were often the artisans who made the goods. Customers usually lived in the same neighborhood as the shops and the shops would gain popularity by their customers’ word-of–mouth recommendation, with the exception of warehouses (i.e., any retail on wholesale), where goods being sold were not necessarily made in the shop.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The art of dress: Clothes and society, 1500-1914|last = Ashelford|first = J|publisher = National Trust|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 195–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, things started to change during the transition to the 19th century. People sought efficiency and variety; under the influence of the [[Industrial Revolution]], improved transportation and introduction of machines in manufacturing allowed fashion to develop at an even faster pace.

The first sewing machine emerged in 1790, and later, Josef Madersperger began developing his first sewing machine in 1807, presenting his first working machine in 1814. The introduction of the sewing machine sped up garment production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Meanwhile, advanced spinning, weaving and cotton-printing techniques developed in the 18th century had already brought detailed, washable fabrics. These durable and affordable fabrics became popular among the majority population. These techniques were further developed by the introduction of machines. Before, accessories like embroidery and lace were manufactured on a small and limited scale by skilled craftsmen and sold in their own shops; in 1804, a machine for embroidering was constructed by John Duncan, and people started producing these essential accessories in factories and dispatching the products to shops throughout the country. These technical developments in clothing production allowed a greater variety of styles; rapid changes in fashion also became possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Industrial Revolution bridged Europe and America with regards to travel. When Louis Simond first arrived to America, he was struck by the mobility of the population and frequency of people made trips to the capital, writing "you meet nowhere with those persons who never were out of their native place, and whose habits are wholly local — nobody above poverty
who has not visited London once in his life; and most of those who can, visit once a year.’&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; New canals and railways not only transported people, but created national and even broader markets by transporting goods that manufactured in factories in great distances. The rise of industry throughout the Western world increased garment production and people were encouraged to travel more widely and purchase more goods than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/European-Culture-19th-Century/Nineteenth-Century-Industrialization.html|title = Nineteenth-Century Industrialization|date = |accessdate = |website = Encyclopedia of Fashion|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication was also improved in this era. New ideas about fashion were conveyed by little dolls dressed in the latest style, newspapers, and illustrated magazines;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Patterns of fashion: The cut and construction of clothes for men and women|last = Arnold|first = J|publisher = Macmillan|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, [[La Belle Assemblée]], founded by [[John Bell (publisher)|John Bell]], was a British women's magazine published from 1806 to 1837.  It was best known for its fashion plates of Regency era styles, showing how women should dress and behave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.regencyhistory.net/2011/11/la-belle-assemblee.html|title = La Belle Assemblée|date = |accessdate = |website = Regency History|publisher = |last = Knowles|first = R}}&lt;/ref&gt; When fashion became available for everybody, people were expected to dress according to the latest fashion. Dressmakers would show the fashion-plates to their customers, so that customers could catch up to the latest styles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Women's fashion==
[[File:Fourth-position-feet-Wilson-Analysis-country-dancing-1811.jpg|thumb|1811 dance dress]]
[[File:Doña Isabel Cobos de Porc by Francisco Goya.jpg|thumb|In [[Spain]], some society ladies rebelled against [[French fashion]] by dressing as majas, like [[Portrait of Doña Isabel de Porcel|Doña Isabel de Porcel]], 1805.]]

===Overview===
In this period, fashionable women's clothing styles were based on the [[Empire silhouette]] — dresses were closely fitted to the torso just under the bust, falling loosely below. In different contexts, such styles are commonly called "[[Directoire style]]" (referring to the [[French Directory|Directory]] government of France during the second half of the 1790s), "[[Empire style]]" (referring to Napoleon's 1804–1814/1815 empire, and often also to his 1800–1804 "consulate"), or "[[British Regency|Regency]]" (loosely used to refer to various periods between the 18th century and the Victorian).

These 1795–1820 fashions were quite different from the styles prevalent during most of the 18th century and the rest of the 19th century, when women's clothes were generally tight against the torso from the natural waist upwards, and heavily full-skirted below (often inflated by means of [[hoop skirt]]s, [[crinoline]]s, [[Pannier (clothing)|panniers]], [[bustle]]s, etc.). Women’s fashion around this time started to follow classical ideals, inspired by the ancient Greek and Roman style with its gracious, loosely falling dresses that were gathered or just accentuated over the natural waist under the bust. For women, tightly laced corsets and brocade gave way to a celebration of the natural form. A woman’s body shape was to be celebrated. Bodices were short with waistlines falling just below the bust. The Empire silhouette defines a dress with a high waist and a long and loosely falling skirt, which lengthens and flatters the body but does not always make it look slim. Fabrics were light to the point of being sheer below the bodice, which made them easier to keep clean. Because gown fabrics were so light, women’s fashions consisted of three layers.

===Gowns===
Inspired by neoclassical tastes, ‘undress’ was the style of the day, casual and informal. It was the type of gown a woman wore from morning until noon or later depending on her social engagements of the day. The short-waisted dresses sported soft, loose skirts and were often made of white, almost transparent [[muslin]], which was easily washed and draped loosely like the garments on Greek and Roman statues. Since the fabric clung to the body, revealing what was underneath, it made nudity ''à la grecque'' a centerpiece of public spectacle.Satin was sometimes worn for evening wear.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Darcy G. "Nudity à La Grecque." The Art Bulletin 80.2 (1998): 311-35.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Half Dress’ is thought of as how one would dress when going out during the day or meeting with guests.‘Full Dress’ was what a lady wore to formal events, day or night. ‘Evening Dress’ was only appropriate at evening affairs.Thus during the 1795–1820 period, it was often possible for middle- and upper-class women to wear clothes that were not very confining or cumbersome, and still be considered decently and fashionably dressed.

Among middle- and upper-class women there was a basic distinction between "morning dress" (worn at home in the afternoons as well as mornings) and evening attire — generally, both men and women changed clothes in preparation for the evening meal and possible entertainments to follow. There were also further gradations such as afternoon dress, walking dress, [[riding habit]]s, travelling dress, dinner dress, etc.

In the ''Mirror of Graces; or the English Lady's Costume'', published in London in 1811, the author ("a Lady of Distinction") advised:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the morning the arms and bosom must be completely covered to the throat and wrists. From the dinner-hour to the termination of the day, the arms, to a graceful height above the elbow, may be bare; and the neck and shoulders unveiled as far as delicacy will allow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?type=header&amp;id=DLDecArts.MirrorGraces&amp;isize=M |title=Mirror of Graces; or the English Lady's Costume'' |accessdate=4 July 2009 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Morning dresses were worn inside the house. They were high-necked and long-sleeved, covering throat and wrists, and generally plain and devoid of decoration.
* Evening gowns were often extravagantly trimmed and decorated with lace, ribbons, and netting. They were cut low and sported short sleeves, baring bosoms. Bared arms were covered by long white gloves. Our Lady of Distinction, however, cautions young women from displaying their bosoms beyond the boundaries of decency, saying, "The bosom and shoulders of a very young and fair girl may be displayed without exciting much displeasure or disgust."

A Lady of Distinction also advised young ladies to wear softer shades of color, such as pinks, periwinkle blue, or lilacs. The mature matron could wear fuller colors, such as purple, black, crimson, deep blue, or yellow.

Many women of this era remarked upon how being fully dressed meant the bosom and shoulders were bare, and yet being under-dressed would mean one's neckline went right up to one's chin.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

=== Silhouette ===
Due to the importance of showing social status, the fashion industry was very much influenced by society during the Regency era. One's  position was determined by the person's wealth, etiquette, family status, intelligence, and beauty. Women financially and socially relied on their husbands. The only socially-acceptable activities in which women could participate centered around social gatherings and fashion, the most important component of which was attending evening parties. These parties helped to build relationships and connection with others. As etiquette dictated different standards of attire for different events, afternoon dress, evening dress, evening full dress, ball dress, and different type of dresses were popular.
[[File:Hortense-de-beauharnais-anne-louis-girodet-de-roucy-triosson.jpg|thumb|Joséphine de Beauharnais]]
Women's fashion in the Regency era started to change drastically. It popularized the empire silhouette, which featured a fitted bodice and high waist. This “new natural style” emphasized the beauty of the body's natural lines. Clothing became lighter and easier to care for than in the past. Women often wore several layers of clothing, typically undergarments, gowns, and outerwear. The chemise, the standard undergarment of the era, prevented the thin, gauzy dresses from being fully transparent. Outerwear, such as the spencer and the pelisse, were popular.

The empire silhouette was created in the late 18th century to about early 19th century, and referred to the period of the First French Empire. This adoption had been linked with France's Relation and adopted of Greek and Roman principles. The style was often worn in white to denote as a high social status. Josephine Bonaparte was the one of the figureheads for the Empire waistline, with her elaborated and decorated Empire line dresses. Regency women followed the Empire style along the same trend of raised waistlines as French styles, even when their countries were at war. Starting from the 1780s and early 1790s, women's silhouette became slimmer and the waistlines crept up. After 1795, waistlines rose dramatically and the skirt circumference was further reduced. Few years later, England and France started to show the focus of high waist style and this led to the creation of Empire style.
[[File:Merry Joseph Blondel - Felicite-Louise-Julie-Constance de Durfort.jpg|thumb|French lady in 1808; the style was often accompanied by a [[shawl]] or similar wrap, or a short "Spencer" jacket, as the dresses were light and left much uncovered]]
The style began as part of [[Neoclassical fashion]], reviving styles from [[Greco-Roman]] art which showed women wearing loose fitting rectangular [[tunic]]s known as [[peplos]] which were belted under the bust, providing support for women and a cool, comfortable outfit especially in warm climate. The empire silhouette was defined by the waistline, which was positioned directly under the bust. The Empire silhouette were the key style in women's clothing during the Regency era. The dresses were usually light, long and fit loosely, they were usually in white and often sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice which strongly emphasized thin hem and tied around the body. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather, and was apparently lain around the midriff when seated—for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favored. The dresses had a fitted bodice and it gave a high-waist appearance.

The style had waxed and waned in fashion for hundreds of years. The shape of the dresses also helped to lengthen the body's appearance. The clothing can also be draped to maximize the bust. Lightweight fabrics were typically used to create a flowing effect. Also, ribbon, sash, and other decorative features were used to highlight the waistline. The empire gowns were often with low neckline and short sleeves and women usually worn them as evening dresses. On the other hand, day gowns had higher neckline and long sleeves. The chemisette was a staple for fashionable ladies. Although there were differences between day dresses and evening dresses, the high waistline was not changed.

===Hairstyles and headgear===

During this period, the classical influence extended to hairstyles. Often masses of curls were worn over the forehead and ears, with the longer back hair drawn up into loose buns or ''Psyche knots'' influenced by Greek and Roman styles. By the later 1810s, front hair was parted in the center and worn in tight ringlets over the ears.&lt;ref name="fashion-era.com"/&gt; Adventurous women like [[Lady Caroline Lamb]] wore short cropped hairstyles "à la [[Titus]]", the ''[[Journal de Paris]]'' reporting in 1802 that "more than half of elegant women were wearing their hair or wig ''à la Titus''", a layered cut usually with some tresses hanging down.&lt;ref&gt;Rifelj, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Mirror of Graces,'' a Lady of Distinction writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, easy tresses, the shining braid, the flowing ringlet confined by the ''antique'' comb, or bodkin, give graceful specimens of the simple taste of modern beauty. Nothing can correspond more elegantly with the untrammeled drapery of our newly-adopted classic raiment than this undecorated coiffure of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?type=header&amp;id=DLDecArts.MirrorGraces&amp;isize=M |title=Mirror of Graces; or the English Lady's Costume'' |accessdate=4 July 2009 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Conservative married women continued to wear linen [[mob cap]]s, which now had wider brims at the sides to cover the ears. Fashionable women wore similar caps for morning (at home undress) wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jane Austen Centre Magazine |url=http://www.janeausten.co.uk/magazine/index.ihtml?pid=299&amp;step=4 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gU5brgbH?url=http://www.janeausten.co.uk/magazine/index.ihtml?pid=299&amp;step=4 |archivedate=2009-05-03 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in centuries, respectable but daringly fashionable women would leave the house without a hat or [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]], previously something often associated with prostitutes. However most women continued to wear something on their head outdoors, though they were beginning to cease to do so indoors during the day (as well as for evening wear). The antique head-dress, or Queen Mary ''[[coif]]'', Chinese hat, Oriental inspired turban, and Highland helmet were popular. As for bonnets, their crowns and brims were adorned with increasingly elaborate ornamentations, such as feathers and ribbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.regencygarderobe.com/Monthly%20QA%20Pages/BonnetsPart2.htm |title=Regency Fashion and Costume |access-date=2006-09-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040306115929/http://www.regencygarderobe.com/Monthly%20QA%20Pages/BonnetsPart2.htm |archive-date=2004-03-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, ladies of the day embellished their hats frequently, replacing old decorations with new trims or feathers.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Undergarments===
[[File:Regency-underclothes detail.png|left|thumb|1811 illustration of underclothes, showing one form of Regency "stays"]]

Fashionable women of the [[Regency era]] wore several layers of [[undergarments]]. The first was the [[chemise]], or shift, a thin garment with tight, short sleeves (and a low neckline if worn under evening wear), made of white cotton and finished with a plain hem that was shorter than the dress. These shifts were meant to protect the outer-clothes from perspiration and were washed more frequently than outer clothes. In fact, washer women of the time used coarse soap when scrubbing these garments, then plunged them in boiling water, hence the absence of color, lace, or other embellishments, which would have faded or damaged the fabric under such rough treatment. Chemises and shifts also prevented the transparent [[muslin]] or silk dresses from being too revealing.

The next layer was a pair of stays or [[corset]]. However, high-waisted classical fashions required no corset for the slight of figure, and there were some experiments to produce garments which would serve the same functions as a modern brassiere. (In the ''Mirror of Graces'', a "divorce" was described as an undergarment that served to separate a woman's breasts. Made of steel or iron that was covered by a type of padding, and shaped like a triangle, this device was placed in the center of the chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?type=header&amp;id=DLDecArts.MirrorGraces&amp;isize=M |title=Mirror of Graces; or the English Lady's Costume'' |accessdate=4 July 2009 |pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;) "Short stays" (corsets extending only a short distance below the breasts) were often worn over the shift or chemise (not directly next to the skin), and "long stays" (corsets extending down towards the natural waist) were worn by a minority of women trying to appear slimmer than they were (but even such long stays were not primarily intended to constrict the waist, in the manner of Victorian corsets.)

The final layer was the [[petticoat]], which could have a scooped neckline and was sleeveless, and was fitted in the back with hooks and [[eyelets]], [[Button (clothing)|buttons]] or tapes. These petticoats were often worn between the underwear and the outer dress and was considered part of the outer clothing not underwear. The lower edge of the petticoat was intended to be seen, since women would often lift their outer dresses to spare the relatively delicate material of the outer dress from mud or damp (so exposing only the coarser and cheaper fabric of the petticoat to risk). Often exposed to view, petticoats were decorated at the hem with rows of tucks or lace, or ruffles.

"Drawers" (underpants with short legs) were only beginning to be worn by a few women during this period. They were tied separately around the waist.

Stockings ([[hosiery]]), made of silk or knitted cotton, were held up by [[garters]] below the knee until [[suspenders]] were introduced in the late 19th century and were often of a white or pale flesh color &lt;ref&gt;"The Costume Book, Nesfield, Cookson. 1935:New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outerwear and shoes===
[[File:Ingres, Madame Riviere.jpg|thumb|''[[Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière|Madame Rivière]]'', 1806, [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], [[The Louvre|Louvre]].]]

During this time period, women's clothing was much thinner than in the [[eighteenth century]] so warmer outerwear became important in fashion, especially in colder climates. Coat-like garments such as pelisses and redingotes were popular, as were shawls, mantles, mantelets, capes and cloaks. The mantelet was a short cape that was eventually lengthened and made into a shawl. The redingote, another popular example, was a full-length garment resembling a man's riding coat (hence the name) in style, that could be made of different fabrics and patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Low|first=Betty-Bright P.|author2=Josephine du Pont and Margaret Manigault|title=Of Muslins and Merveilleuses: Excerpts from the Letters of Josephine du Pont and Margaret Manigault|journal=Winterthur Portfolio|year=1974|volume=9|pages=29–75|jstor=1180568|doi=10.1086/495824}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the period, the [[India]]n [[shawl]] was the favoured wrap,&lt;ref name="Payne_outer"&gt;Payne 1965, p. 447–449&lt;/ref&gt; as houses and the typical [[English country house]] were generally draughty, and the sheer muslin and light silk dresses popular during this time provided less protection. Shawls were made of soft [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]] or [[silk]] or even [[muslin]] for summer. Paisley patterns were extremely popular at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victoriana.com/library/paisley/shawl.html|title=Paisley Shawl - Shawls of Paisley Design|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short (high-waisted) jackets called ''spencers''&lt;ref name="Payne_outer" /&gt; were worn outdoors, along with long-hooded [[cloaks]], Turkish wraps, mantles, capes, Roman tunics, [[chemisette]]s, and overcoats called ''pelisses''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/austen/pelisse.html|title=Jane Austen's Hampshire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which were often sleeveless and reached down as far as the ankles). These outer garments were often made of double sarsnet, fine Merino cloth, or velvets, and trimmed with fur, such as swan's down, fox, chinchilla, or sable. On May 6, 1801, Jane Austen wrote her sister Cassandra, "Black gauze cloaks are worn as much as anything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/brablet5.html |title=Letters of Jane Austen |accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thin, flat fabric (silk or velvet) or leather slippers were generally worn (as opposed to the high-heeled shoes of much of the 18th century).

Metal [[pattens]] were strapped on shoes to protect them from rain or mud, raising the feet an inch or so off the ground.

===Accessories===
[[File:LaBelleAssembleeLondon1813.jpg|thumb|ca. 1813]]

[[Gloves]] were always worn{{by whom|date=January 2013}} outside the house. When worn inside, as when making a social call, or on formal occasions, such as a ball, they were removed when dining.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=18890 Musee du Louvre] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the length of the glove, A Lady of Distinction writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If the prevailing fashion be to reject the long sleeve, and to partially display the arm, let the glove advance considerably above the elbow, and there be fastened with a [[draw-string]] or armlet. But this should only be the case when the arm is muscular, coarse, or scraggy. When it is fair, smooth, and round, it will admit of the glove being pushed down to a little above the wrists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?type=header&amp;id=DLDecArts.MirrorGraces&amp;isize=M |title=Mirror of Graces; or the English Lady's Costume'' |accessdate=4 July 2009 |page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Longer gloves were worn rather loosely during this period, crumpling below the elbow. As described in the passage above, "garters" could fasten longer gloves.

[[Reticule (handbag)|Reticule]]s held personal items, such as [[smelling salts|vinaigrette]]s. The form-fitting dresses or frocks of the day had no pockets, thus these small drawstring handbags were essential. These handbags were often called buskins or balantines. They were rectangular in shape and was worn suspended by a woven band from a belt placed around the figure above the waist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bigelow|first=Marybelle S.|title=Fashion in History: Western Dress, Prehistoric to Present|date=1979|publisher=Burgess Publishing Company|location=Minneapolis|pages=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parasols]] (as shown in the illustration) protected a lady's skin from the sun, and were considered an important fashion accessory. Slender and light in weight, they came in a variety of shapes, colors, and sizes.

Fashionable ladies (and gentlemen) used [[Fan (implement)|fans]] to cool themselves and to enhance gestures and body language. Made of paper or silk on sticks of ivory and wood, and printed with oriental motifs or popular scenes of the era, these ubiquitous accessories featured a variety of shapes and styles, such as pleated or rigid. An information sheet from the [[Cheltenham Museum]] describes fans and their use in body language and communication (click and scroll to page 4).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cheltenhammuseum.org.uk/search/fans_info_sheet.pdf Cheltenham Art Gallery &amp; Museum]

By the mid-1790s, neoclassical clothing had come into fashion in France.&lt;ref name="Cage 2009 193–215"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cage|first=E. Claire|title=The Sartorial Self: Neoclassical Fashion and Gender Identity in France, 1797-1804|journal=Eighteenth-Century Studies|year=2009|volume=42|issue=2|pages=193–215|doi=10.1353/ecs.0.0039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several influences had combined to bring about this simplification in women's clothing: aspects of Englishwomen's practical country outdoor-wear leaked up into French high fashion, and there was a reaction in revolutionary France against the stiffly boned corsets and brightly colored satins and other heavy fabrics that were in style in the Ancien Régime (see [[1750–1795 in fashion]]). But ultimately, [[Neo-classicism]] was adopted for its association with classical republican ideas [with reference to Greece, rather than republican Rome, which was now considered politically dangerous].&lt;ref name="Cage 2009 193–215"/&gt; This renewed fascination of the classical past was encouraged by the recent discoveries of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], and would likely have not been possible outside such a specific geographic and historical setting that allowed the idea of the past made present to become paramount.&lt;ref name="Hornsby 2000 123–146"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hornsby|first=Clare|title=The Impact of Italy: The Grand Tour and Beyond|year=2000|publisher=The British School at Rome|pages=123–146|chapter=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the influences of the Pompeii and Herculaneum excavations, several other factors came together to popularize neoclassical dress. Starting in the early 1790s, [[Emma Hamilton]] began her performances of attitudes, something that was considered by contemporaries as entirely new. These attitudes were based loosely on the ancient practice of pantomime, though Emma's performances lacked masks and musical accompaniment.&lt;ref name="Hornsby 2000 123–146"/&gt; Her performances created a fusion between art and nature; art came alive and her body became a type of art.&lt;ref name="Wurst 2001 151–181"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wurst|first=Karin A.|title=Spellbinding: The Body as Art/Art as Body in the Cultural Practice of Attitüden|journal=Lessing Yearbook 2001|year=2001|volume=33|pages=151–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an aid to her performances of tragic mythological and historical figures, Emma wore the clothing á la grecque that would become popular in mainstream France in the coming years. A simple light colored chemise made from thin, flowing material was worn and gathered with a narrow ribbon under the breasts. Simple cashmere shawls were used as headdresses or to give more fullness to the drapery of the chemise. They also helped to prevent broken lines in the performance so that the outstretched arms were always connected with the body, escalating the effect of fluid movement, and oftentimes, a cape or a cloak was worn to emphasize the lines of the body in certain poses. This highlighted the continuity of surface of line and form in the body of the performer to emphasize the unity, simplicity, and continuously flowing movement from one part of the body to the next. The hair was worn in a natural, loose, and flowing fashion. All of these properties blended together to allow an extensive play of light and shadow to reveal and accent certain parts of the body during the performance, while covering others.&lt;ref name="Wurst 2001 151–181"/&gt; Emma was highly capable in her attitudes, and the influence of her dress spread from Naples to Paris as wealthy Parisians took the Grand Tour.

[[File:Toomuch-1556 Toolittle-1796 caricature.jpg|thumb|left|A satirical 1796 contrast between old Elizabethan and Directoire clothing styles: ''Too Much and Too Little'', reads the caption of this caricature by [[Isaac Cruikshank]] ]]
There is also some evidence that the white muslin shift dress became popular after Thermidor through the influence of prison dress. Revolutionary women such as Madame Tallien portrayed themselves in this way because it was the only clothing they possessed during their time in prison. The chemise á la grecque also represented the struggle for representation of the self and the stripping down of past cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;Freund, Amy. "The Citoyenne Tallien: Women, Politics, and Portraiture during the French Revolution," Art Bulletin, vol. 93 no. 3 (2011), 325-344.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a simplification of the attire worn by preteen girls in the 1780s (who were no longer required to wear [[:File:1778-Bourgeois-daughter-fashion.jpg|miniature versions of adult stays and panniers]]) probably paved the way for the simplification of the attire worn by teenage girls and adult women in the 1790s. Waistlines became somewhat high by 1795, but skirts were still rather full, and neoclassical influences were not yet dominant.

It was during the second half of the 1790s that fashionable women in France began to adopt a thoroughgoing Classical style, based on an idealized version of ancient Greek and Roman dress (or what was thought at the time to be ancient Greek and Roman dress), with narrow clinging skirts. Some of the extreme Parisian versions of the neoclassical style (such as narrow straps which bared the shoulders, and diaphanous dresses without sufficient stays, petticoats, or shifts worn beneath) were not widely adopted elsewhere, but many features of the late-1790s neoclassical style were broadly influential, surviving in successively modified forms in European fashions over the next two decades.

With this Classical style came the willingness to expose the breast. With the new iconography of the Revolution as well as a change in emphasis on maternal breast-feeding, the chemise dress became a sign of the new egalitarian society.&lt;ref&gt;Yalom, Marilyn. A History of the Breast. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The style was simple and appropriate for the comfort of a pregnant or nursing woman as the breasts were emphasized and their availability was heightened. Maternity became fashionable and it was not uncommon for women to walk around with their breasts exposed. Some women took the “fashionable maternity” a step further and wore a “six-month pad” under their dress to appear pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Gelpi, Barbara C. "Significant Exposure: The Turn‐of‐the‐century Breast." Nineteenth-Century Contexts 20.2 (1997): 125-45. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

White was considered the most suitable color for neoclassical clothing (accessories were often in contrasting colors). Short [[train (clothing)|trains]] trailing behind were common in dresses of the late 1790s.

===Empire (1800–1815)===
[[File:1815 English and French.jpg|thumb|English and French fashions, 1815. The [[morning dress]] has back gathers and long sleeves, and like the walking costume, has trim at the hemline and new detail at the upper sleeve.]]

During the first two decades of the 19th century, fashions continued to follow the basic high-waisted [[empire silhouette]], but in other respects neoclassical influences became progressively diluted. Dresses remained narrow in front, but fullness at the raised back waist allowed room to walk. Colors other than white came into style, the fad for diaphanous outer fabrics faded (except in certain formal contexts), and some elements of obvious visible ornamentation came back into use in the design of the dress (as opposed to the elegant simplicity or subtle white-on-white embroidery of the dress of ca. 1800).

This era signaled the loss of any lingering [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]], pseudo-Grecian styles in women's dress. This decline was especially evident in France due to the Emperor [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] suppression of trade in the fabrics used in neoclassical dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cage|first=E.

Larger and more abundant decoration, especially near the hem and neckline foreshadowed greater extravagance in the coming years. More petticoats were being worn, and a stiffer, more cone-shaped skirt became popular. Stiffness could be supplemented by layers of ruffles and tucks on a hem, as well as corded or flounced petticoats. Sleeves began to be pulled, tied, and pinched in ways that were more influenced by [[Romanticism|romantic]] and [[Gothic art|gothic]] styles than neoclassical. Hats and hairstyles became more elaborate and trimmed, climbing higher to balance widening skirts.

===Overview===
This period saw the final abandonment of [[lace]], [[embroidery]], and other embellishment from serious men's clothing outside of formalized [[court dress]]—it would not reappear except as an affectation of [[Artistic Dress movement|Aesthetic dress]] in the 1880s and its successor, the "Young Edwardian" look of the [[1960s in fashion|1960s]]. Instead, cut and tailoring became much more important as an indicator of quality.&lt;ref name="Payne_men"&gt;Payne 1865, pp. 452–455&lt;/ref&gt; This transformation can be attributed in part to an increased interest in antiquity stemming from the discovery of classical engravings, including the Elgin Marbles. The figures depicted in classical art were viewed as an exemplar of the ideal natural form, and an embodiment of Neoclassical ideas. The style in London for men became more and more refined and this was due to the influence of two things: the dandy and the romantic movement. The dandy (a man who placed high importance on personal aesthetics and hobbies but wanted to seem totally nonchalant about it) arguably emerged as early as the 1790s. Dark colors were all but mandatory. (Dark doesn’t necessarily mean dreary though, many items, particularly vests and coats were cut from rich, vivid fabrics.) Blue tailcoats with gold buttons, were everywhere. White muslin shirts (sometimes with ruffles on the neck/sleeves) were extremely popular. Breeches were officially on their way out, with pants/trousers taking their place. Fabrics in general were becoming more practical silk and more wool, cotton, and buckskin. Therefore, in the 18th century, dress was simplified and greater emphasis was put on tailoring to enhance the natural form of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hollander|first=Anne|title=Sex and Suits: The Evolution of Modern Dress|date=1995|publisher=Kodansha|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was also the period of the rise of [[hair wax]] for styling men's hair, as well as [[mutton chops]] as a style of facial hair.

[[Breeches]] became longer—tightly fitted leather riding breeches reached almost to the boot tops—and were replaced by pantaloons or [[trousers]] for fashionable street wear. The French Revolution is largely responsible for altering standard male dress. During the revolution, clothing symbolized the division between the upper classes and the working class revolutionaries. French rebels earned the nickname [[sans-culottes]], or "(the people without breeches," because of the loose floppy trousers they popularized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perl|first=Lila|title=From Top Hats to Baseball Caps, From Bustles to Blue Jeans|date=1990|publisher=Clarion Books|location=New York|isbn=0899198724|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coat (clothing)|Coats]] were cutaway in front with long skirts or tails behind, and had tall standing [[collar (clothing)|collars]]. Lapels were not as large as they had been in years before and often featured an M-shaped notch unique to the period.&lt;ref name="Payne_men" /&gt;

Shirts were made of linen, had attached collars, and were worn with stocks or wrapped in a [[necktie|cravat]] tied in various fashions. Pleated frills at the cuffs and front opening went out of fashion by the end of the period.&lt;ref name="Payne_men" /&gt;

Waistcoats were high-waisted, and squared off at the bottom, but came in a broad variety of styles. They were often double-breasted, with wide lapels and stand collars. Around 1805 large lapels that overlapped those of the jacket began to fall out of fashion, as did the 18th century tradition of wearing the coat unbuttoned, and gradually waistcoats became less visible. Shortly before this time waistcoats were commonly vertically striped but by 1810 plain white waistcoats were increasingly fashionable, as did horizontally striped waistcoats. High-collared waistcoats were fashionable until 1815, then collars were gradually lowered as the shawl collar came into use toward the end of this period.&lt;ref name="Payne_men" /&gt;

Overcoats or ''greatcoats'' were fashionable, often with contrasting collars of fur or velvet. The ''garrick'', sometimes called a coachman's coat, was a particularly popular style, and had between three and five short caplets attached to the collar.&lt;ref name="Payne_men" /&gt;

[[Boots]], typically [[Hessian boot]]s with heart-shaped tops and [[tassel]]s were mainstay in men's footwear. After the Duke of Wellington defeated Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, [[Wellington boot]]s, as they were known, became the rage; tops were knee-high in front and cut lower in back. The jockey boot, with a turned-down cuff of lighter colored leather, had previously been popular but continued to be worn for riding.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; [[Court shoes]] with elevated heels became popular with the introduction of trousers.

===The rise of the dandy===
The clothes-obsessed [[dandy]] first appeared in the 1790s, both in [[London]] and [[Paris]]. In the [[slang]] of the time, a dandy was differentiated from a [[fop]] in that the dandy's dress was more refined and sober. The dandy prided himself in "natural excellence" and tailoring allowed for exaggeration of the natural figure beneath fashionable outerwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=Anne|title=The Modernization of Fashion|journal=Design Quarterly|date=Winter 1992|issue= 154|pages=27–33|jstor=4091263|publisher=Walker Art Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In ''High Society: A Social History of the Regency Period, 1788–1830'', Venetia Murray writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Other admirers of dandyism have taken the view that it is a sociological phenomenon, the result of a society in a state of transition or revolt. Barbey d'Aurevilly, one of the leading French dandies at the end of the nineteenth century, explained:

:"Some have imagined that dandyism is primarily a specialisation in the art of dressing oneself with daring and elegance. It is that, but much else as well. It is a state of mind made up of many shades, a state of mind produced in old and civilised societies where gaiety has become infrequent or where conventions rule at the price of their subject's boredom...it is the direct result of the endless warfare between respectability and boredom."

In Regency London dandyism was a revolt against a different kind of tradition, an expression of distaste for the extravagance and ostentation of the previous generation, and of sympathy with the new mood of democracy.&lt;ref name="Murray 1998"&gt;Murray 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Beau Brummell]] set the fashion for dandyism in [[United Kingdom|British]] society from the mid-1790s, which was characterized by immaculate personal cleanliness, immaculate linen [[shirt]]s with high collars, perfectly tied cravats, and exquisitely tailored plain dark coats&lt;ref name="Payne_men" /&gt; (contrasting in many respects with the [[Maccaroni (fashion)|"maccaroni"]] of the earlier 18th century).

Brummell abandoned his [[Wig (hair)|wig]] and cut his [[hair]] short in a Roman fashion dubbed ''à la Brutus'', echoing the fashion for all things classical seen in women's wear of this period. He also led the move from breeches to snugly tailored pantaloons or trousers, often light-colored for day and dark for evening, based on working-class clothing adopted by all classes in France in the wake of the [[Revolution]]. In fact, Brummel's reputation for taste and refinement was such that, fifty years after his death, [[Max Beerbohm]], wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In certain congruities of dark cloth, in the rigid perfection of his linen, in the symmetry of his glove with his hand, lay the secret of Mr Brummell's miracles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not every male aspiring to attain Brummel's sense of elegance and style succeeded, however, and these dandies were subject to caricature and ridicule. Venetia Murray quotes an excerpt from ''Diary of an Exquisite'', from ''The Hermit in London'', 1819:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Took four hours to dress; and then it rained; ordered the tilbury and my umbrella, and drove to the fives' court; next to my tailors; put him off after two years tick; no bad fellow that Weston...broke three stay-laces and a buckle, tore the quarter of a pair of shoes, made so thin by O'Shaughnessy, in [[St. James's Street]], that they were light as brown paper; what a pity they were lined with pink satin, and were quite the go; put on a pair of Hoby's; over-did it in perfuming my handkerchief, and had to recommence ''de novo''; could not please myself in tying my [[cravat]]; lost three quarters of an hour by that, tore two pairs of kid gloves in putting them hastily on; was obliged to go gently to work with the third; lost another quarter of an hour by this; drove off furiously in my chariot but had to return for my splendid [[Decorative boxes|snuff-box]], as I knew that I should eclipse the circle by it.&lt;ref name="Murray 1998" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Hairstyles and headgear===
During this period, younger men of fashion began to wear their hair in short curls, often with long sideburns. In 1795, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]]'s [[hair powder tax]] effectively ended the fashion for wigs and powder, and new styles like the Brutus and the [[Eponymous hairstyle#Men|Bedford Crop]] became fashionable. Older men, military officers, and those in conservative professions such as lawyers, judges, physicians, and servants retained their [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] and powder. Formal court dress also still required powdered hair.

[[Tricorne]] and [[bicorne]] hats were still worn, but the most fashionable hat was tall and slightly conical; this would evolve into the [[top hat]] and reign as the only hat for formal occasions for the next century.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival of Directoire/Empire/Regency fashions==
During the first half of the Victorian era, there was a more or less negative view of women's styles of the 1795–1820 period. Some people would have felt slightly uncomfortable to be reminded that their mothers or grandmothers had once promenaded about in such styles (which could be considered indecent according to Victorian norms), and many would have found it somewhat difficult to really empathize with (or take seriously) the struggles of a heroine of art or literature if they were being constantly reminded that she was wearing such clothes. For such reasons, some Victorian [[history painting]]s of the Napoleonic wars intentionally avoided depicting accurate women's styles (see example below), [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]]'s illustrations to his book ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' depicted the women of the 1810s wearing [[1830s and 1840s in fashion|1840s fashions]], and in [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s 1849 novel ''[[Shirley (novel)|Shirley]]'' (set in 1811–1812) neo-Grecian fashions are anachronistically relocated to an earlier generation.

Later in the Victorian period, the Regency seemed to retreat to an unthreateningly remote historical distance, and [[Kate Greenaway]] and the [[Artistic Dress movement]] selectively revived elements of early 19th century fashions. During the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, many genre paintings, sentimental valentines, etc. contained loose depictions of 1795–1820 styles (then considered to be quaint relics of a bygone era). In the late 1960s / early 1970s, there was a limited fashion revival of the [[Empire silhouette]].

In recent years, 1795–1820 fashions are most strongly associated with [[Jane Austen]]'s writings, due to the various movie adaptations of her novels. There are also some Regency fashion "urban myths", such as that women dampened their gowns to make them appear even more diaphanous (something which was certainly not practiced by the vast majority of women of the period).

The decade of the '''1870s in film''' involved some significant events.

==Events==
*1874 – French astronomer [[Pierre Janssen]] used his "photographic revolver" to photograph the [[Passage de Venus|transit of the planet Venus across the Sun]]. 
*1877 – French inventor [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]] improved on the [[Zoetrope]] idea by placing mirrors at the center of the drum. He called his invention the [[Praxinoscope]]. Reynaud developed other versions of the Praxinoscope, too, including a Praxinoscope Theatre (where the device was enclosed in a viewing box) and the Projecting Praxinoscope. Eventually he created the "[[Théâtre Optique]]", a large machine based on the Praxinoscope, but was able to project longer animated strips. In the United States, the McLoughlin Bros. from New York released in 1879 a simplified (and unauthorized) copy of Reynaud's invention under the name "Whirligig of Life".
*1878 – Railroad tycoon [[Leland Stanford]] hired British photographer [[Eadweard Muybridge]] to settle the questions of whether a galloping horse ever had all four of its feet off the ground. Muybridge [[Sallie Gardner at a Gallop|successfully photographed]] a horse in fast motion using a series of 12 cameras controlled by trip wires. Muybridge's photos showed the horse with all four feet off the ground. Muybridge went on a lecture tour showing his photographs on a moving-image device he called the [[zoopraxiscope]]. Muybridge's experiments inspired French scientist [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] to invent equipment for recording and analyzing animal and human movement. Marey called his invention the chronophotographic camera, which was able to take multiple images superimposed on top of one another.
*1879 – American [[George Eastman]] invents an emulsion-coating machine which enables the mass-production of [[photography|photographic]] dry plates.

The '''Karim Khan Castle''' ({{lang-fa|ارگ کریم خان}} ''Arg-e Karim Khan'') is a citadel located in the downtown [[Shiraz]], southern [[Iran]]. It was built as part of a complex during the [[Zand dynasty]] and is named after [[Karim Khan]], and served as his living quarters. In shape it resembles a medieval fortress.

At times, the citadel was used as a prison. Today, it is a museum operated by [[Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization]].

[[Karim Khan]] Castle is also known as Arge Karim Khan, Arge Karim Khani, Karim khans' castle or [[citadel]] of [[Karim Khan]].

==History==

Arg-e-Karim Khan was built in 1180 AH (1766-7). [[Karim Khan]] invited the best architects and artists of the time and bought the best materials from other cities and abroad for the construction of the castle of [[Karim Khan]], which was quickly constructed. During the Zand dynasty it was used by the king as living quarters. During the Qajar period it was used as the governor's seat.

Prince Abdolhosein Mirza Farmanfarma, governor of [[Fars Province]], ordered the miniatures in the castle to be renovated.

After the fall of the Qajar Dynasty it was converted into a prison and the paintings were plastered over. In 1971 it was given to [[Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization]]. The renovation of the castle started in 1977.

==Description==

Karim Khan Castle is located at Shahrdari Square. It has a land area of 4,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and is in the center of a 12,800 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; compound.&lt;ref name=Citadel&gt;[http://www.khayerin-salamat.sums.ac.ir/argekarim.htm retrieved 11 Feb 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906091729/http://www.khayerin-salamat.sums.ac.ir/argekarim.htm |date=September 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Citadel of Karim Khan consists of four high walls connected by four 14 m round brick towers at a 90-degree angle. Each 12 m wall is carnalized and is 3 meters thick at the base and 2.8 meters at the top.&lt;ref name=Citadel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shiraz&gt;{{cite web|author=محمد جواد مطلع |url=http://www.shirazcity.org/Home/sightseeing.html |title=شهرداری شیراز |publisher=Shirazcity.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the citadel combines military and residential architecture, for it was the home of [[Karim Khan]] and the military center of the dynasty.&lt;ref name=Shiraz/&gt;

[[James Edward Alexander]] in 1827 described the citadel as being surrounded by a "deep wet ditch".&lt;ref&gt;James Edward Alexander, Travels from India to England: Comprehending a Visit to the Burman Empire, Parbury, Allen (1827) p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

Tile works depicting legendary tales were added at the entrance gate of the citadel during the [[Qajar Dynasty|Qajar Era]].

'''Beck's Futures''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] art prize founded by [[London]]'s [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] and sponsored by [[Beck's]] [[beer]] given to contemporary [[art]]ists. 

Prior to the establishment of the prize in 2000, Beck's had sponsored several exhibitions of contemporary art in Britain by providing free beer. Together with [[Artangel]], they had also commissioned a number of works by artists, including [[Rachel Whiteread]]'s ''[[House (sculpture)|House]]'' and ''Water Tower'' and pieces by [[Douglas Gordon]] and [[Tony Oursler]].

Although it does not receive as much publicity as the [[Turner Prize]], the prize fund is larger - in 2003, it was £65,000 to the Turner Prize's £20,000. Of this, £20,000 went to the winner, who also took a share of the £40,000 divided between all the shortlisted artists. The remaining £5,000 was allocated to the Student Prize for Film and Video, with £2,000 of that going to the winner.

For the first three years of the prize a call for nominations was made to curators and critics around the UK. This proved controversial as unlike the Turner Prize artists knew they had been nominated even if they did not make the final shortlist. The open call was replaced with an anonymous nominations panel. 

==Winners==

As well as Nashashibi, the shortlisted artists were [[Bernd Behr]], [[Nick Crowe (artist)|Nick Crowe]], [[Alan Currall]], [[Inventory (artists)|Inventory]], [[David Sherry (artist)|David Sherry]], [[Lucy Skaer]], [[Francis Upritchard]] and [[Carey Young]]. The panel of judges was chaired by the artist [[Michael Landy]], and also included the curators [[Russell Ferguson]], [[Maria Lind]] and [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]].

The 2004 prize was awarded on April 27 to [[Saskia Olde Wolbers]]. The other shortlisted artists were [[Haluk Akakçe]], [[Tonico Lemos Auad]], [[Simon Bedwell]], [[Ergin Çavusoglu]], [[Andrew Cross (artist)|Andrew Cross]], [[Susan Philipsz]], [[Imogen Stidworthy]], [[Hayley Tompkins]] and [[Nicoline Van Harskamp]].

The 2005 prize, presented by [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], was awarded on April 26 to [[Christina Mackie]]. The other shortlisted artists were [[Lali Chetwynd]], [[Luke Fowler]], [[Ryan Gander]], [[Daria Martin]], and [[Donald Urquhart]].

The 2006 prize was awarded to [[Matt Stokes]] by a panel made-up of [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]], [[Martin Creed]], [[Cornelia Parker]], [[Yinka Shonibare]] and [[Gillian Wearing]]. There was also a public vote, the outcome of which was added as an extra vote in the judging panels final count. Shortlisted for the prize were [[Blood ‘n’ Feathers]] (Jo Robertson &amp; Lucy Stein, [[Pablo Bronstein]], [[Stefan Brüggemann]], [[Richard Hughes (artist)|Richard Hughes]], [[Flávia Müller Medeiros]], [[Seb Patane]], [[Olivia Plender]], [[Simon Popper]], [[Jamie Shovlin]], [[Daniel Sinsel]], [[Matt Stokes]], [[Sue Tompkins]], [[Bedwyr Williams]]. This was to be the [[Beck's]] sponsored prize's last year.

== History == 

Billingham Bags (M Billingham &amp; Co Ltd) was founded in 1973 by Martin Billingham,&lt;ref name=Pedlars&gt;{{cite web|title=An Interview with Harry Billingham|url=http://www.pedlars.co.uk/pedlarsworld/stories/an-interview-with-harry-billingham/|work=Pedlars|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still owned and run by the Billingham family. Originally a manufacturer of fishing bags, in 1978 Billingham discovered that a large number of their bags were being sold to a [[photographer]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=Pedlars/&gt;&lt;ref name="Digital Trends"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Montgomery|first1=Kelly|title=Billingham Classic 550 Camera Bag defies time, elements|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/billingham-classic-550-camera-bag-defies-time-elements/|website=Digital Trends|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year production had switched almost entirely to specialist camera bags. Billingham Bags have worldwide distribution and are still hand made in [[Cradley Heath]], [[England]]. Billingham bags are notable for their process of bonding the fabric of the bag to [[butyl rubber]] for [[waterproofing|water resistance]]. Billingham have had partnerships with well known camera manufacturers [[Leica_Camera|Leica]] and [[Hasselblad]], making custom camera bags for both companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web||title=Billingham Combination Bag For The Leica M Review|url=http://findingrange.com/2011/10/03/billingham-combination-bag-for-the-leica-m-review/|work=Finding Range|date=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web||title=Billingham produces exclusive bag for the Hasselblad X1D|url=https://www.ephotozine.com/article/hasselblad-x1d---medium-format-mirrorless-camera-announced-29505|work=ePhotoZine|date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also had a number of collaborations with British fashion and design house Pedlars.&lt;ref name=Pedlars/&gt; The company celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web||title=Billingham marks 40 years of history|url=http://www.dpreview.com/articles/4340088218/billingham-marks-40-years-of-histor|work=DPReview|date=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage===

* ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', the [[paranormal]] TV series, had an episode titled "Bloody Mary" during its [[Supernatural (season 1)|first season]], involving a ghost that attacked those who were looking into a mirror while her name was repeated, although she was only capable of "leaping" into mirrors within a certain range of the mirror that she killed herself in front of. In the course of the investigation, it is revealed that the original "Bloody Mary" was an aspiring actress who was found dead in front of her mirror of an apparent [[suicide]], but she wrote the first few letters of a name on the glass before she died, with the investigating detectives noting that Mary was said to be having an affair with a doctor, speculating that he was the actual killer, but there was no actual evidence to prove that theory. Due to her death, Mary's ghost would only attack people who looked in a mirror while her name was being invoked- whether they were the ones who said her name or not- if they had some secret relating to their role in another's death, with the protagonists seeking to stop Mary as she cannot distinguish between a man killing his wife and disguising it as a suicide or a young woman whose obsessive boyfriend killed himself because she left him.

[[Image:Kloster Lorsch 05.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lorsch monastery gatehouse]] 
'''Carolingian architecture''' is the style of north European [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque architecture]] belonging to the period of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the late 8th and 9th centuries, when the [[Carolingian]] dynasty dominated west European politics. It was a conscious attempt to emulate [[Roman architecture]] and to that end it borrowed heavily from [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] and [[Byzantine architecture]], though there are nonetheless innovations of its own, resulting in a unique character.

The gatehouse of the [[Lorsch Abbey|monastery at Lorsch]], built around 800, exemplifies [[Classical architecture|classical]] inspiration for Carolingian architecture, built as a triple-arched hall dominating the gateway, with the arched facade interspersed with attached [[Classical architecture|classical]] columns and [[pilasters]] above.

The [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]] constructed between 792–805 was inspired by the octagonal [[Emperor Justinian|Justinian]] church of [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale]] in Ravenna, built in the 6th century, but at Aachen there is a tall monumental western entrance complex, as a whole called a ''[[westwork]]''—a Carolingian innovation.

Carolingian churches generally are [[basilica]]n, like the [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] churches of Rome, and commonly incorporated [[westwork]]s, which is arguably the precedent for the western facades of later medieval cathedrals. An original [[westwork]] survives today at the [[Abbey of Corvey]], built in 885.

The '''Church of the Holy Saviour in Chora''' ({{lang-el|Ἐκκλησία τοῦ Ἁγίου Σωτῆρος ἐν τῇ Χώρᾳ|}}, {{lang-tr|Kariye Müzesi, Kariye Camii, Kariye Kilisesi}}) is a medieval [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] Greek Orthodox church preserved as the Chora Museum in the [[Edirnekapı, Istanbul|Edirnekapı]] neighborhood of [[Istanbul]].{{sfn|Ousterhout|1988}} The neighborhood is situated in the western part of the [[List of municipalities in İstanbul Province|municipality]] ([[:tr:Belediye|belediye]]) of the [[Fatih]] district. In the 16th century, during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era, the church was converted into a mosque; it became  a museum in 1948. The interior of the building is covered with some of the oldest and finest surviving  Byzantine [[mosaic]]s and [[fresco]]es; they were uncovered and restored after the building was secularized and turned into a museum.

[[File:Chora Church Constantinople 2007 panorama 002.jpg|thumb|Rear view of Chora Church]]
The Chora Church was originally built as part of a monastery complex outside the walls of [[Constantinople]], to the south of the [[Golden Horn]]. Literally translated, the church's full name was the '''Church of the Holy Saviour in the Country''':  although "The Church of the Holy Redeemer in the Fields" would be a more natural rendering of the name in English.  ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|ἡ Ἐκκλησία τοῦ Ἁγίου Σωτῆρος ἐν τῇ Χώρᾳ}}, ''hē Ekklēsia tou Hagiou Sōtēros en tēi Chōrai'').&lt;ref&gt;and therefore sometimes incorrectly referred to as "Saint Saviour"&lt;/ref&gt; The last part of that name, '''Chora''', referring to its location originally outside of the walls, became the shortened name of the church. The original church on this site was built in the early 4th century, and stood outside of the [[Walls_of_Constantinople#Wall_of_Constantine|4th century walls]] of [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine the Great]]. However, when [[Theodosius II]] built his formidable [[Walls of Constantinople#Theodosian Walls|land walls]] in 413–414, the church became incorporated within the city's defences, but retained the name ''Chora''. The name must have carried symbolic meaning, as the mosaics in the [[narthex]] describe [[Christ]] as the ''Land of the Living'' ({{lang|grc|ἡ Χώρα τῶν ζώντων}}, ''hē Chōra tōn zōntōn'') and [[Mary, the Mother of Jesus]], as the ''Container of the Uncontainable'' ({{lang|grc|ἡ Χώρα τοῦ Ἀχωρήτου}}, ''hē Chōra tou Achōrētou'').

The majority of the fabric of the current building dates from 1077–1081, when Maria Dukaina, the mother-in-law of [[Alexius I Comnenus]], rebuilt the Chora Church as an [[Cross-in-square|inscribed cross]] or [[quincunx]]: a popular architectural style of the time. Early in the 12th century, the church suffered a partial collapse, perhaps due to an [[earthquake]]. The church was rebuilt by [[Isaac Komnenos (son of Alexios I)|Isaac Comnenus]], Alexius's third son. However, it was only after the third phase of building, two centuries after, that the church as it stands today was completed. The powerful Byzantine statesman [[Theodore Metochites]] endowed the church with many of its fine [[mosaic]]s and [[fresco]]s. Theodore's impressive decoration of the interior was carried out between 1315 and 1321. The mosaic-work is the finest example of the [[Palaeologus|Palaeologian]] Renaissance. The artists remain unknown. In 1328, Theodore was sent into exile by the usurper [[Andronicus III Palaeologus]]. However, he was allowed to return to the city two years later, and lived out the last two years of his life as a [[monk]] in his Chora Church.

In the late 13th and early 14th centuries, the monastery was home to the scholar [[Maximus Planudes]], who was responsible for the restoration and reintroduction of [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]]'s [[Ptolemy's Geography|''Geography'']] to the Byzantines and, ultimately, to [[Renaissance Italy]]. During the last [[Fall of Constantinople|siege of Constantinople]] in 1453, the [[Icon]] of the [[Theotokos]] [[Hodegetria]], considered the protector of the City, was brought to Chora in order to assist the defenders against the assault of the [[Ottomans]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Millingen&lt;/ref&gt;

Around fifty years after the fall of the city to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], Atık Ali Paşa, the [[Grand Vizier]] of Sultan [[Bayezid II]], ordered the Chora Church to be converted into a [[mosque]] — ''Kariye Camii''. Due to the [[iconoclasm|prohibition against iconic images]] in [[Islam]], the mosaics and frescoes were covered behind a layer of plaster. This and frequent earthquakes in the region have taken their toll on the artwork.

In 1948, Americans [[Thomas Whittemore]] and Paul A. Underwood, from the [[Byzantine Institute of America]] and the [[Dumbarton Oaks]] Center for Byzantine Studies, sponsored a restoration program. From that time on, the building ceased to be a functioning mosque. In 1958, it was opened to the public as a museum — ''Kariye Müzesi''.

== Interior ==
The Chora Church is not as large as some of the other surviving Byzantine churches of Istanbul (it covers 742.5 m²) but it is unique among them, because of its almost completely still extant internal decoration. The building divides into three main areas: the entrance hall or ''[[narthex]]'', the main body of the church or ''[[nave|naos]]'', and the side [[chapel]] or ''[[parecclesion]]''. The building has six [[dome]]s: two in the esonarthex, one in the parecclesion and three in the naos.

=== Narthex ===
The main, west door of the Chora Church opens into the [[narthex]]. It divides north-south into the ''exonarthex'' and ''esonarthex''.

==== Exonarthex ====

[[File:StPeter-mosaic-from-Chora-church-in-Istanbul.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint Peter [[mosaic]]]]

The exonarthex (or outer narthex) is the first part of the church that one enters. It is a transverse corridor, 4 m wide and 23 m long, which is partially open on its eastern length into the parallel esonarthex. The southern end of the exonarthex opens out through the esonarthex forming a western ante-chamber to the parecclesion. The mosaics that decorate the exonarthex include:

# Joseph's dream and journey to Bethlehem;
# Enrollment for taxation;
# Nativity, birth of Christ;
# Journey of the Magi;
# Inquiry of King Herod;
# Flight into Egypt;
# Two frescoes of the massacres ordered by King Herod;
# Mothers mourning for their children;
# Flight of Elizabeth, mother of John the Baptist;
# Joseph dreaming, return of the holy family from Egypt to Nazareth;
# Christ taken to Jerusalem for the Passover;
# John the Baptist bearing witness to Christ;
# Miracle;
# Three more Miracles.
# Jesus Christ;
# Virgin and Angels praying.

==== Esonarthex ====
[[File:HSX Mary genealogy.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of the Virgin Mother with child, north dome of the inner narthex]]
[[File:Chora Christ south coupole.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of [[Christ Pantocrator]], south dome of the inner narthex]]

The esonarthex (or inner narthex) is similar to the exonarthex, running parallel to it. Like the exonarthex, the esonarthex is 4 m wide, but it is slightly shorter, 18 m long. Its central, eastern door opens into the naos, whilst another door, at the southern end of the esonarthex opens into the rectangular ante-chamber of the parecclesion. At its northern end, a door from the esonarthex leads into a broad west-east corridor that runs along the northern side of the naos and into the [[Prothesis (altar)|prothesis]]. The esonarthex has two domes. The smaller is above the entrance to the northern corridor; the larger is midway between the entrances into the naos and the pareclession.

# Enthroned Christ with [[Theodore Metochites]] presenting a model of his church;
# [[Saint Peter]];
# [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]];
# [[Deesis]], Christ and the Virgin Mary (without John the Baptist) with two donors below;
# Genealogy of Christ;
# Religious and noble ancestors of Christ.

The mosaics in the first three bays of the inner narthex give an account of the [[Life of the Virgin]], and her parents. Some of them are as follows:
# Rejection of [[Joachim|Joachim's]] offerings;
# Annunciation of [[Saint Anne]], the angel of the Lord announcing to Anne that her prayer for a child has been heard;
# Meeting of Joachim and Anne;
# Birth of the Virgin Mary;
# First seven steps of the Virgin;
# The Virgin given affection by her parents;
# The Virgin blessed by the priests;
# Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple;
# The Virgin receiving bread from an Angel;
# The Virgin receiving the skein of purple wool, as the priests decided to have the attendant maidens weave a veil for the Temple;
# [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] praying, when it was the time to marry for the Virgin, High Priest Zechariah called all the widowers together and placed their rods on the altar, praying for a sign showing to whom she should be given;
# The Virgin entrusted to Joseph;
# Joseph taking the Virgin to his house;
# [[Annunciation]] to the Virgin at the well;
# Joseph leaving the Virgin, Joseph had to leave for six months on business and when he returned the Virgin was pregnant and he is suspicious of that.

[[File:HSX Koimetesis.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of the ''Koimesis'' in the Naos]]

=== Naos ===
The central doors of the esonarthex lead into the main body of the church, the ''naos''. The largest dome in the church (7.7 m diameter) is above the centre of the naos. Two smaller domes flank the modest [[apse]]: the northern dome is over the [[Prothesis (altar)|prothesis]], which is linked by short passage to the [[bema]]; the southern dome is over the [[diaconicon]], which is reached via the parecclesion.
# ''Koimesis'', the [[Assumption of Mary|Dormition of the Virgin]]. Before ascending to Heaven, her last sleep. Jesus is holding an infant, symbol of Mary's soul;
# Jesus Christ;
# ''Theodokos'', the Virgin Mary with child.

[[File:Chora Church Constantinople 2007 010.jpg|thumb|View into the ''[[parecclesion]]'']]

=== Parecclesion ===
To the right of the esonarthex, doors open into the side chapel, or ''parecclesion''. The parecclesion was used as a mortuary chapel for family burials and memorials. The second largest dome (4.5 m diameter) in the church graces the centre of the roof of the parecclesion. A small passageway links the parecclesion directly into the naos, and off this passage can be found a small oratory and a storeroom. The parecclesion is covered in [[fresco]]es:

# [[Resurrection|Anastasis]], the Resurrection. Christ, who had just broken down the gates of hell, is standing in the middle and pulling Adam and Eve out of their tombs. Behind Adam stand John the Baptist, David, and Solomon. Others are righteous kings;
# Second coming of Christ, the last judgment. Jesus is enthroned and on both sides the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist (this trio is also called the Deesis);
# Virgin and Child;
# Heavenly Court of Angels;
# Two panels of Moses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5714">A '''clapper loader''' or '''second assistant camera''' (2nd AC) is part of a [[film crew]] whose main functions are that of loading the raw [[film stock]] into [[camera magazine]]s, operating the [[clapperboard]] (slate) at the beginning of each take, marking the actors as necessary, and maintaining all records and paperwork for the camera department. The name "clapper loader" tends to be used in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, while "second assistant camera" tends to be favored in the United States, but the job is essentially the same whichever title is used. The specific responsibilities and division of labor within the department will almost always vary depending on the circumstances of the shoot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmproductionroles11med23.wikispaces.com/Clapper+Loader Filmproductionroles.com clapper loader]&lt;/ref&gt;

The camera magazine is inside the lighter color "blimp" on the top of the camera; the camera head is inside the darker color "blimp" on the bottom; the camera magazine can be removed to be reloaded by the clapper loader]]

== Functions ==
Clapper loaders have a very important role as practically the only people on set who directly and physically oversee the state of the undeveloped [[Negative (photography)|negative]]. The loader - the only person who actually handles the negative between the manufacturer and the laboratory -  thus can easily render an entire day's work useless if the film is handled improperly. Additionally, the loader usually controls all records with regard to the film stock - from when it is received until when it is sent out to the lab; if this information is miscommunicated or missing, this too can destroy an expensive shoot. Furthermore, the loader usually has much more to do in addition to these tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startintv.com/jobs/clapper-loader-2nd-assistant-cameraman.php startintv.com clapper-loader]&lt;/ref&gt; Noted director of photography [[Oliver Stapleton]] has written on his website:

{{quote|The LOADER loads the camera, oddly enough, with film made by either [[Kodak]] or [[Fujifilm|Fuji]]. Loading may not sound like much of a job, but in actuality it is very important. If the wrong film is in the camera, or if it gets loaded twice, or lost, or put in the wrong can, then the scene which corresponded to: Scene 56 - The Army advanced over the hill, the jets dropped their bombs, and the volcano erupted... could be lost. When this happens the Loader can become deeply unpopular very quickly. [[Stanley Kubrick|Kubrick]] fired one loader I know on his first day of work for walking across the set holding a magazine upside down. Not Kubrick’s first day of work - the Loader's. This was a trifle harsh, but there is a right way to do the job, and the rules are there for a very good reason. If you screw up the minimum cost is about $20,000 and the max any figure you might care to imagine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cineman.co.uk/#camera cineman.co.uk Camera LOADER]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:35mm cinema release print.jpg|thumb|upright|Each [[35 mm film|35&amp;nbsp;mm]] roll contains a maximum of 2,000 feet, or 22.22 minutes of running time at 24 [[Frame_rate#Film_and_television|fps]], with a customary maximum of 18–19 minutes.]]

== Duties ==
A full description of the job duties includes the following (although different shoots may often not always require all of these):
*generally assisting the rest of the camera crew ([[focus puller]], [[camera operator]], [[director of photography]])
*utilizing the camera trainee, film loader, and/or camera runner if one has been brought onto the production
*keeping inventory of all equipment, film, and expendables
*requesting film stock as needed
*securing the equipment
*unloading/loading equipment off/on the camera truck daily if necessary
*checking loading materials and spaces to prevent light leaks
*cleaning and keeping clean the magazines and the loading environment
*organizing and cleaning the equipment space
*maintaining and cleaning the equipment
*loading and unloading of film stock from and to the magazines
*labelling of equipment, boxes, magazines, and storage spaces
*marking actors and props (leaving a marker of their positions as the scene is [[blocking (stage)|blocked]] for the purpose of measuring distance from the camera so that its focus can be adjusted throughout the scene)
*marking and operating the clapperboard properly
*keeping meticulous and accurate camera notes
*writing negative report sheets in detail
*interfacing with continuity in order to note which takes to print
*charging of batteries for camera and accessories
*preparation of film to be sent to the lab
*keeping records of time, per diems, and expenses for the entire camera crew
*liaising regularly with production, rental houses, editing, laboratories, and unions
*recordkeeping of all camera-related paperwork, including negative reports, daily stock reports, film inventory reports, lab orders, rental contracts, and expendable orders
*ensuring that all instructions from the director of photography are passed along properly to labs and post houses
*relaying reports from the lab about the rushes to the director of photography

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27199">{{Main article|Characteristics of Harold Pinter's work#"Comedy of menace"}}
'''Comedy of menace''' is the body of plays written by [[David Campton]], [[Nigel Dennis]], [[N. F. Simpson]], and [[Harold Pinter]].  The term was coined by drama critic [[Irving Wardle]], who borrowed it from the subtitle of Campton's play ''[[The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace]]'', in reviewing Pinter's and Campton's plays in ''[[Encore (magazine)|Encore]]'' in 1958.  (Campton's subtitle ''Comedy of Menace'' is a jocular play-on-words derived from ''[[comedy of manners]]''—''menace'' being ''manners'' pronounced with somewhat of a Judeo-English accent.)&lt;ref name=Merritt&gt;See Merritt 5, 9–10, 225–28, 240, 310, and 326, citing articles by Wardle, Gussow's ''Conversations with Pinter'', and various performance reviews by Wardle, Gussow, and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Citing Wardle's original publications in ''Encore'' magazine (1958), Susan Hollis Merritt points out that in "Comedy of Menace" Wardle "first applies this label to Pinter's work … describ[ing] Pinter as one of 'several playwrights who have been tentatively lumped together as the "non-naturalists" or "abstractionists"&amp;nbsp;' (28)" (Merritt 225).  His article "Comedy of Menace," Merritt continues,
&lt;blockquote&gt;centers on ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' because it is the only play of Pinter's that Wardle had seen [and reviewed] at the time, yet he speculates on the basis of "descriptions of [Pinter's] other plays, '[[The Room (play)|The Room]]' and '[[The Dumb Waiter]]', [that Pinter] is a writer dogged by one image—the womb" (33).  Mentioning the acknowledged "literary influences" on Pinter's work—"Beckett, Kafka and American gangster films"—Wardle argues that "&amp;nbsp;'The Birthday Party' exemplifies the type of comic menace which gave rise to this article." (225)&lt;ref&gt;[[Cf.]] Billington 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "Comedy of Menace", as Merritt observes, on the basis of his experience of ''The Birthday Party'' and others' accounts of the other two plays, Wardle proposes that "Comedy enables the committed agents and victims of destruction to come on and off duty; to joke about the situation while oiling a revolver; to display absurd or endearing features behind their masks of implacable resolution; to meet … in paper hats for a game of blind man's buff"; he suggests how "menace" in Pinter's plays "stands for something more substantial: destiny," and that destiny, "handled in this way—not as an austere exercise in classicism, but as an incurable disease which one forgets about most of the time and whose lethal reminders may take the form of a joke—is an apt dramatic motif for an age of conditioned behaviour in which orthodox man is a willing collaborator in his own destruction" (Wardle, "Comedy of Menace" 33; rpt. in ''The Encore Reader'' 91).

"Just two years later" (1960), however, Wardle retracted "Comedy of Menace" in his review of ''[[The Caretaker]]'', stating: "On the strength of 'The Birthday Party' and the pair of one-acters, I rashly applied the phrase 'comedy of menace' to Pinter's writing.  I now take it back" ("There's Music" 130, as qtd. in Merritt 225–26).

After Wardle's retraction of ''comedy of menace'' as he had applied it to Pinter's writing, Pinter himself also occasionally disavowed it and questioned its relevance to his work (as he  also did with his own offhand but apt statement that his plays are about "the weasel under the cocktail cabinet").  For example, in December 1971, in his interview with Pinter about ''[[Old Times]]'', [[Mel Gussow]] recalled that "After ''[[The Homecoming]]'' [Pinter] said that [he] 'couldn't any longer stay in the room with this bunch of people who opened doors and came in and went out.  ''[[Landscape]]'' and ''[[Silence]]'' [the two short poetic memory plays that were written between ''The Homecoming'' and ''Old Times''] are in a very different form.  There isn't any menace at all.'&amp;nbsp;"  Later, when Gussow asked Pinter to expand on his view that he had "tired" of "menace", Pinter added: "when I said that I was tired of menace, I was using a word that I didn't coin.  I never thought of menace myself.  It was called 'comedy of menace' quite a long time ago [1958].  I never stuck categories on myself, or on any of us [playwrights].  But if what I understand the word menace to mean is certain elements that I have employed in the past in the shape of a particular play, then I don't think it's worthy of much more exploration" (Gussow, ''Conversations with Pinter'' 18, 24).

Despite Wardle's retraction of ''comedy of menace'' (and Pinter's later qualifications), ''Comedy of menace'' and ''comedies of menace'' caught on and have been prevalent since the late 1950s in advertisements and in critical accounts, notices, and reviews to describe Pinter's early plays and some of his later work as well.&lt;ref name=Merritt/&gt;  As Merritt points out, among other examples of critics' usage of this and similar categories of Pinter's work, after Gussow's 1971 "conversation" with Pinter, "Though he echoes Wardle's concept, Gussow seems to avoid using ''comedy of menace'' when reviewing the CSC Repertory Theatre's 1988 production of ''The Birthday Party''.  While still emphasizing Pinter's 'terrors' and the 'shiver beneath the laughter,' Gussow describes the play as 'a play of intrigue, with an underlying motif of betrayal' … [and] [Bernard F.] Dukore calls the play 'a comedy (of menace or otherwise)' … (Merritt 10).

;''The Birthday Party'' (1958)

In discussing the first production of Pinter's first full-length play, ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' (1958), which followed his first play, ''[[The Room (play)|The Room]]'' (1957), his authorised official biographer [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] points out that Wardle "once excellently" described its setting (paraphrasing Wardle), as "a banal living-room [which] opens up to the horrors of modern history" (Billington 86).

;''The Dumb Waiter'' (1960)

In his second one-act play, ''[[The Dumb Waiter]]'' (1960), as accentuated through the 2008 film by [[Martin McDonagh]] closely resembling and markedly influenced by it, ''[[In Bruges]]'', "Pinter conveys the idea of political terror through the staccato rhythms of [[music hall|music-hall]] cross-talk and the urban thriller: [[Hackney Empire]] cross-fertilises with [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Killers (Hemingway short story)|The Killers]]'' [1927]" (Billington 90), one of Pinter's own acknowledged early influences, along with [[Franz Kafka]] (348–49); Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists, such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Webster]], and [[Cyril Tourneur]], whose work his schoolmaster Joseph Brearley had introduced to him; [[Samuel Beckett]] (mostly his novels [43]); and black-and-white American movies of the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=WardleinMerritt&gt;See Wardle, "Comedy of Menace" 33, as qtd. in Merritt 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

"A near-perfect play about the testiness of a collapsing partnership and the divide-and-rule tactics of authority," according to Billington, ''The Dumb Waiter'' focuses on two characters, Gus and Ben; Gus is "the man who questions the agreed system and who is ultimately destroyed by his quest for meaning"; Ben, "the man who blindly obeys orders and thereby places himself at risk.  (If the system can arbitrarily dispose of his partner, why not of him?)" (92).  As Pinter's ''The Dumb Waiter'' has been categorised as a "comedy of menace," so may be  McDonagh's ''In Bruges'', as it closely resembles it; yet, despite the comedy and the sense of threat growing out of the menace, these works of Pinter and McDonagh are, in Pinter's words to Billington, also "doing something which can be described as political" (92).  At the same time, [Pinter] had – and still [in 1996 through to the time of his death in 2008] has – an acute sense of the fragility of earthly happiness and of the terrors that haunt us even from infancy" (92).

The "punning title" of ''The Dumb Waiter'', Billington observes, "carries several layers of meaning": "It obviously refers to the antique serving-hatch that despatches [sic] ever more grotesque orders for food to these bickering gunmen"—the [[dumbwaiter (elevator)|dumbwaiter]]; "But it also applies to Gus, who, troubled by the nature of the mission [their next job as hitmen] to realise he is its chosen target; or, indeed to Ben, who, by his total obedience to a higher authority that forces him to eliminate his partner, exposes his own vulnerability" (89).  As Gus "dumbly" awaits his fate, he may be a subservient partner who awaits orders from the "senior partner" Ben, but Ben too is subservient to [[The powers that be (phrase)|The Powers That Be]], a contemporary variation on [[Deus ex machina]], manipulating both the mechanical dumbwaiter and them through its increasingly extravagant and thus comically inconvenient "orders" for increasingly exotic dishes, unnerving both of them.

Billington adds:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This being Pinter, the play has a metaphorical openness.  You can interpret it as an [[Theatre of the absurd|Absurdist comedy]] – a kind of ''[[Waiting for Godot|Godot]]'' in [[Birmingham]] – about two men passing the time in a universe without meaning or purpose.  You can see it as a cry of protest against a whimsically cruel God who treats man as His plaything – even the twelve matches that are mysteriously pushed under the door have been invested with religious significance [by critics].  But it makes much more sense if seen as a play about the dynamics of power and the nature of partnership.  Ben and Gus are both victims of some unseen authority ''and'' a surrogate married couple quarrelling, testing, [[talking past each other]] and raking over old times. (90)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The comedy in this "comedy of menace" often derives from such arguments between Gus and Ben, especially the one that occurs when "Ben tells Gus to go and light the kettle," a "semantic nit-picking that is a standard part of music-hall comedy": "All the great stage and film double acts – [[Jimmy Jewel|Jewel]] and [[Ben Warriss|Warriss]], [[Abbott and Costello]] – fall into this kind of verbal worrying in which the bullying 'male' straight man issues instructions which are questioned by the more literal-minded 'female' partner" —
&lt;blockquote&gt;
GUS: Light what?&lt;br&gt;
BEN: The kettle.&lt;br&gt;
GUS: You mean the gas.&lt;br&gt;
BEN: Who does?&lt;br&gt;
GUS: You do.&lt;br&gt;
BEN: (''his eyes narrowing''): What do you mean, I mean the gas?&lt;br&gt;
GUS: Well, that's what you mean, don't you? The gas.&lt;br&gt;
BEN: (''Powerfully''): If I say go and light the kettle I mean go and light the kettle.&lt;br&gt;
GUS: How can you light a kettle?&lt;br&gt;
BEN: It's a figure of speech! Light the kettle.  It's a figure of speech! (Qtd. in Billington 90–91)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Billington observes further,
&lt;blockquote&gt;This kind of comic pedantry has precise echoes of the great [[Sid Field]] – ironically [since the city is the setting of this play] a Birmingham comic – who had a famous sketch in which he played a virgin of the greens being hectored by [[Jerry Desmonde]]'s golf pro who would cry, in exasperation, 'When I say "Slowly Back" I don't mean "Slowly Back", I mean "Slowly Back."&amp;nbsp;' At another moment, the bullying pro would tell the hapless Sid to get behind the ball and he would vainly protest 'But it's behind all round it'. But, where in a music-hall sketch this kind of semantic by-play was its own justification, in Pinter it becomes a crucial part of the power-structure.  … The pay-off comes when Gus, having dogmatically insisted that the accurate phrase is 'put on the kettle', suddenly finds an irritated Ben adopting the right usage. (91)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Everything" in ''The Dumb Waiter'', Billington observes, "contributes towards a necessary end"; for, "the image, as Pete says in [Pinter's only novel] ''[[The Dwarfs (novel)|The Dwarfs]]'', stands in exact correspondence and relation to the idea" (91).  In this example, the central image and central metaphor, the dumbwaiter, while "despatching ever more unlikely orders," serves as "both a visual gag and a metaphor for manipulative authority" (91), and therein lies its menace.  When Ben instructs Gus verbally, while practicing their "routine" for killing their next victim, he leaves out the most important line, which instructs Gus to "take out" his "gun" (Pinter, ''The Dumb Waiter'' 114–15):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"BEN ''frowns and presses his forehead''.&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  You've missed something out.&lt;br&gt;
BEN.  I know.  What?&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  I haven't taken my gun out, according to you.&lt;br&gt;
BEN.  You take your gun out—&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  After I've closed the door.&lt;br&gt;
BEN.  After you've closed the door.&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  You've never missed that out before, you know that?&lt;br&gt;
(Pinter, ''The Dumb Waiter'' 116)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The crucial significance of the omission becomes clear only at the very end of the play, when "Gus enters through the door stage-right – the one marked for the intended victim – stripped of his gun and holster"; it becomes clear that ''he'' is going to be "Ben's target" (Billington 92), as Ben's "''revolver [is] levelled at the door''", though the play ends ''before'' Ben fires any shot (Pinter, ''The Dumb Waiter'' 121).

;''The Caretaker'' (1960)

In an entry on Pinter for the 1969 edition of ''[[The Encyclopedia of World Drama]]'' cited by Merritt, Wardle repeats and updates some of his first perspective on ''comedy of menace'' as he had applied it initially to Pinter's writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Early in his writing career Pinter admitted to three influences: [[Franz Kafka]], American gangster films, and [[Samuel Beckett]]. . . . At that time his plays, more than those of any other plawright's {{sic}}, were responsible for the newly coined term 'comedy of menace.'  This phrase certainly makes sense when applied to ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' . . . or to ''[[The Dumb Waiter]]''. . . . But 'menace' is hardly the word for ''[[The Caretaker]]'', and still less for subsequent plays in which Pinter increasingly exchanged his derelict settings and down-and-out characters for environments of moneyed elegance (657–58).  (Qtd. in Merritt 240)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite those more-recent caveats regarding applying the phrase that he himself initially coined for Pinter's writing to ''The Caretaker''—only the second of Pinter's full-length plays produced by then and the one that launched his career as a successful playwright in 1960 (Merritt 9, 226) —and to Pinter's later plays, scenes in both acts of ''The Caretaker'' in which Mick confronts an unsuspecting Davies and scares him almost speechless (Pinter, ''The Caretaker'' 129, 146) also epitomise how comedy and menace still co-exist in Pinter's text and on Pinter's stage.

The comic aspects of this play multiply, reaching a crescendo in Mick's monologue in Act Two describing his "deepest wishes" for decorating the attic room (161, 173) and falling with Davies, a tramp taken in out of the cold by his brother, suggesting that "if" he can "just get down to Sidcup" to get his "papers" and "sort" himself "out" (113–16, 164), his refrain and excuse for everything (153, 175–79), he might just be able to accomplish Mick's hyperbolic pipe dream and "decorate the attic room out for [Mick]" (164), leading Mick to accuse Davies of misrepresenting himself as "an experienced first-class professional interior and exterior decorator" (172–74), an absurd conclusion, given the tangible evidence of the down-and-out Davies before Mick (and the audience).

Pinter's friend the late film and stage director [[David Jones (director)|David Jones]], who directed the play for the [[Roundabout Theatre]], in [[New York City]], in 2003 (having previously directed Pinter's 1983 film of ''[[Betrayal (1983 film)|Betrayal]]'', as well as other works by or featuring him), reminds his audience that Pinter himself said, in a widely quoted statement, that ''The Caretaker'' is only "funny, up to a point" and that "beyond that point" is why he wrote it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is always mischief lurking in the darkest corners. The world of The Caretaker is a bleak one, its characters damaged and lonely. But they are all going to survive. And in their dance to that end they show a frenetic vitality and a wry sense of the ridiculous that balance heartache and laughter. Funny, but not too funny. As Pinter wrote, back in 1960: "As far as I am concerned The Caretaker IS funny, up to a point. Beyond that point, it ceases to be funny, and it is because of that point that I wrote it." (Jones)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Beyond the point" of the comedy (the "funny") lies the scary territory that threatens one's very existence (Billington 92), which Wardle and others commonly have "labeled" or "pigeonholed" (depending on one's perspective) as "menace" (Merritt 9–10).

;Pinter's later plays

Though "comedy of menace" is generally applied to Pinter's early work of the late 1950s through the middle of the 1960s, including ''[[The Collection (play)|The Collection]]'' (1961), ''[[The Lover (play)|The Lover]]'' (1963), ''[[Tea Party (play)|Tea Party]]'' (1965, 1968), and ''[[The Homecoming]]'' (1965), even Pinter's late plays, like ''[[Ashes to Ashes (play)|Ashes to Ashes]]'' (1996) and ''[[Celebration (play)|Celebration]]'' (2000), his last two full-length stage plays, exhibit his characteristic amalgam of the comic and the menacing, a sense of threat or impending doom; there is less comedy and more menace in ''Ashes to Ashes'', in which heavy echoes of the [[Holocaust]] predominate; a more comedy than menace in ''Celebration'', where heightened comic dialogue outweighs the frightening undercurrents of terror, the terrifying, or the terrible.

;''Celebration'' (2000)

While reviewers and other audience members describe ''[[Celebration (play)|Celebration]]'' as hilarious ("one of Pinter's funniest plays", according to Billington [404]), the nature of the relationships of two sets of diners (three couples) having dinner in an upscale restaurant (which some critics assume that Pinter modeled on [[The Ivy]], in London's [[West End (London)|West End]]) – "this is the best and most expensive restaurant in the whole of Europe" (Pinter, ''Celebration'' 364) – remains characteristically ambiguous; Billington describes one set of couples as "a strangely rootless bunch with a depleted sense of family" (405).

One set (the two couples seated at Table One) consists of brothers Lambert and Matt and their wives, Prue and Julie, who are sisters; the second set of diners (the couple seated at Table Two) consists of a banker and his young wife, Suki, who comically turns out to have had an affair with Lambert when she was 18 (Billington 104).

As the "''maître d'hôtel''" emits platitudes geared to elevate the nouveaux riches in their own imagined esteem ("I believe the concept of this restaurant rests in that [[public house]] of my childhood" [Pinter, ''Celebration'' 371]), the "''maîtress d'hôtel''" appears to dwell on a peculiar past family and sex life (373–74), while the Waiter engages in "interjections" spinning fantasied impossible memories of a grandfather who knew writers, other artists, and various other public figures of multiple decades and geographical locations too far apart to have been experienced personally in one man's lifetime (367, 375).

Lambert and Matt reveal themselves to be rather uncouth bullies ("[[Teddy boys]]", according to some London reviews)—
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Lambert's [[mobile phone]] rings''.&lt;br&gt;
LAMBERT  Who the fuck's this?&lt;br&gt;
''He switches it on''.&lt;br&gt;
LAMBERT (''cont''.)  Yes? What? (''He listens briefly''.)  I said no calls! It's my fucking wedding anniversary!&lt;br&gt;
''He switches it off''.&lt;br&gt;
LAMBERT (''cont''.) Cunt.&lt;br&gt;  (Pinter, ''Celebration'' 364)—&lt;/blockquote&gt;
who describe themselves as "consultants … Strategy consultants. … It means we don't carry guns.  … We don't have to! … We're peaceful strategy consultants. … Worldwide.  Keeping the peace (379). ''Strategy consultant'' could be a [[euphemism|euphemistic]] catchall for  warmonger, manager of [[terrorism]], purveyor of [[counter-terrorism]], or orderer of [[covert operations]].

As the banker Russell interprets their explanation, ''peaceful strategy consultants'' seems vaguely menacing: "We need more people like you.  Taking responsibility.  Taking charge.  Keeping the peace.  Enforcing the peace.  Enforcing peace.  We need more like you" (379).  This speech stressing "force" (in the repetitions of ''Enforcing'') occurs after Russell has already revealed his own ilk:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Look at me.  I'm basically a totally disordered personality; some people would describe me as a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]].  (''to Suki'') Am I right?&lt;br&gt;
SUKI  Yes.&lt;br&gt;
RUSSELL  But when I'm sitting in this restaurant I suddenly find I have no psychopathic tendencies at all.  I don't feel like killing everyone in sight, I don't feel like putting a bomb under everyone's arse.  I feel something quite different, I have a sense of equilibrium, of harmony, I love my fellow diners.  Now this is very unusual for me.  Normally I feel—as I've just said—absoute malice and hatred towards everyone within spitting distance—but here I feel love. How do you explain it?&lt;br&gt;
SUKI  It's the ambience. (370–71)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lambert and Matt are distantly reminiscent of Gus and Ben from ''The Dumb Waiter''; but distinctly less polite while living much higher on the hog.  One imagines such characters 
"strategically" plotting the "peaceful" rendition of others without any qualms while sipping [[Perrier]] and simultaneously planning their next wedding-anniversary dinner celebration (perhaps with a different set of wives) on their [[Mobile phone|mobiles]].

As the Waiter says in his apparently penultimate "interjection", in which one might detect intimations of mortality:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My grandfather introduced me to the mystery of life and I'm still in the middle of it.  I can't find the door to get out.  My grandfather got out of it.  He left it behind him and he didn't look back.&lt;br&gt;
He got that absolutely right.&lt;br&gt;
And I'd like to make one further interjection.&lt;br&gt;
''He stands still''.&lt;br /&gt;
''Slow fade''.&lt;br&gt;
(385)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;"Apart From That" (Sketch) (2006)

Pinter mocks [[mobile phone]]s comically in an ostensibly-trivial wireless conversation, while still suggesting a residual bit of menace in the unsaid, developed as his last revue sketch ''[[Apart From That (sketch)|Apart From That]]'' (2006).  As Billington observes, this dramatic sketch inspired by Pinter's strong aversion to mobile phones is "very funny", but "as two people trade banalities over their mobile phones[,] there is a hint of something ominous and unspoken behind the clichéd chat" (429), as illustrated in the following excerpt:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Two people on mobile phones''.&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
How are you?&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
Very well.  And you? Are you well?&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
I'm terribly well.  How about you?&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
Really well.  I'm really well.&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
I'm so glad.&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
Apart from ... oh you know ...&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
I know.&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
Apart from ... oh you know ...&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
I do know. But apart from that ...?&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
How about you?&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
Oh you know ... all things considered ...&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
I know.  But apart from that ...?&lt;br /&gt;
''Silence''.&lt;br /&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
Sorry. I've lost you.&lt;br&gt;
[....]
("Apart From That" 5–6)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Dedalo Minosse International Prize for commissioning a building''' is promoted by ALA-Assoarchitetti, Italian association for professional [[Architects]].&lt;br /&gt;
This prize, was created in 1997 to emphasize the client's role as a fundamental partner of both the architect and the builder in generating high-quality work.

The name '''Dedalo Minosse''' derives from [[Daedalus]] and [[Minos]].&lt;br /&gt;
[[Daedalus]] is considered the first architect of [[greek mythology]], while [[Minos]] was the first client.

The Prize is awarded biennially by a jury that includes internationally renowned architects, writers, art historians, journalists, industry executives, and planning officials.&lt;br /&gt;
Additional prizes are awarded by ALA-Assoarchitetti and by Dedalo-Minosse patrons.

The presentation ceremony takes place in [[Teatro Olimpico]] in [[Vicenza]], northern [[Italy]], the city of architect [[Andrea Palladio]].

Eligibility is open to architects, engineers and clients from around the world, with separate recognition for established architects and those under 40 years of age.

The '''detective dénouement''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|d|eɪ|ˈ|n|uː|m|ɒ̃|,_|d|ɪ|-}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|d|eɪ|n|uː|ˈ|m|ɒ̃}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/denouement?q=D%C3%A9nouement "dénouement"]. ''[[Cambridge Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|denumɑ̃|lang}}) is a variant on the [[literature|literary]] [[dénouement]] common to [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] stories.

==Overview==
Detective dénouement was first popularised by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] [[novels]], but is present in many stories, such as the works of [[Agatha Christie]] or in [[Ellen Raskin]]'s young adult novel ''[[The Westing Game]]''.

In detective stories, the dénouement is the segment of a mystery novel in which the [[protagonist]] of the story, or a character serving in his or her stead, reveals all of the clues and lays out the conclusion for the other characters. This is usually in an attempt to show the readers how the character came to the conclusion and figured out the mystery. One famous example of the detective dénouement is the explanatory speech given by a [[forensic]] [[psychology|psychologist]] after the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of the 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. In the U.S. television series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', the title character ([[Adrian Monk]]) usually uses this method with the words "here's what happened." A [[black-and-white]] montage of the events prior to the murder accompanies his narration.

'''Dimitrie Serafim''' (1862 – 1931) was a Romanian painter in the [[Academic art|Academic]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] styles.  

==Biography==
Serafim was born in [[Bucharest]]. His father, Anton Serafim (1838-1911) was a [[Religious art|church painter]] of Greek ancestry  who originally came from [[Varna]]. His two brothers also became church painters. 

From 1882 to 1888, he studied in Bucharest with [[Theodor Aman]] and [[Gheorghe Tattarescu]],&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.artline.ro/Dimitrie-Serafim--Pictori-romani--23643-1-n.html Biographical notes] @ Artlne.&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to receive a scholarship, his family provided him with an allowance to study at the [[Académie Julian]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Z"&gt;[http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/dimitrie-serafim-1862-1931-2984522/ Critical commentary] by "Tudor Octavian" @ Ziarul de Duminică.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, he exhibited at the first "Salon de Arta Românească", finally receiving a stipend that enabled him to return to Paris, where he worked with [[Jean-Léon Gerôme]] and [[Jean-Jacques Henner]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; 

Under the influence of Tattarescu and [[Nicolae Grigorescu]], he had focused on Impressionism, but his later studies turned him to the Academic style and he began to favor large canvases on mythological themes. Many of his post-Paris works have been characterized as "[[L'art pompier]]".&lt;ref name="Z" /&gt;

After 1901, he was a Professor at the "Academia de Arte Frumoase" (now the [[Universitatea Națională de Arte București]]),&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; but was apparently not a particularly distinguished teacher. His paintings were later criticized by [[Petru Comarnescu]] for their "excessive pathos".&lt;ref name="Z" /&gt; Very few of his works are in museums.

'''Elena Kaplinskaya''' (October 17, 1928, Moscow - January 3, 2014, Moscow), Russian writer, playwright, screenwriter, author of theatrical dramas, screenplays, short stories and novels, a member of the Russian Writers 'Union, the Union of Journalists of Russia and the Moscow Writers' Union [1]

==Biography==
Elena Kaplinskaya was born in [[Moscow]] in 1928 and studied at the Musical College of Gnesin. In 1955 she graduated from the scriptwriting faculty of the VGIK and married the Polish actor and film director Tsezary Kaplinsky.  She was a member of the Writers' Union from 1978 and from 1994 member of the Union of Journalists of Russia. Kaplinskaya trained as a scriptwriter and became the winner of many creative writing competitions including that of Belarusfilm, the competition for the Prize of Pogodin and the International Competition for the best woman's story in 1992.

Elena Kaplinskaya worked with prominent contemporary filmmakers such as Kostromenko, Titov, Brovkin and many others. Besides screenplays Kaplinskaya wrote theatrical plays, novels and short stories, and her articles were published in literary journals including the independent literary and political magazine "Friendship of Nations".

Elena Kaplinskaya's native city, Moskow, and the city played a central part in her stories. In her novel "A Moscow Story" the image of the city and its habitants are presented as the symbol of goodness and justice. The novel was born out of the complex changes in the social life in Moscow in the 1970s and early 1980s and became the subject of heated social and literary discussions. The novel was translated into French in 1984 and was published in Paris by Messidor Publishing.

The heroes of her other novel, "The Cinema of Moscow", belong to the first generation of post-war youth in Russia. The story also partly takes part in Hungary and describes the life of the Hungarian anti-fascists and documentary film director [[Ilona Kolonits]]. The play "The Best Loved" Kaplinskaya wrote in memory of all those who died in [[World War II]]  in Russia at the [[Battle of Kursk]] while defending the cities of [[Leningrad]] (now [[Saint-Petersburg]]) and [[Stalingrad]] (now [[Volgograd]]) . Kaplinskaya's film scripts were made into feature films by many film directors in Russia.

'''''Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence''''' is an Australian book by [[Doris Pilkington Garimara|Doris Pilkington]], published in 1996. Based on a true story, the book is a personal account of an [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous Australian]] family's experiences as members of the [[Stolen Generation]] &amp;ndash; the forced removal of mixed-race children from their families during the early 20th century. It tells the story of three young [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] girls: [[Molly Kelly (Australian Aboriginal Icon)|Molly]] (the author's mother), [[Daisy Kadibil|Daisy]] (Molly's half-sister), and Gracie (their cousin), who are forcibly removed from their families at [[Jigalong]] and taken to [[Moore River Native Settlement|Moore River]], but escape from the government settlement in 1931, and then trek over {{convert|1,600|km}} home by following the [[rabbit-proof fence]], a massive [[pest-exclusion fence]] which crossed [[Western Australia]] from north to south.

The book was adapted as a film, ''[[Rabbit-Proof Fence (film)|Rabbit-Proof Fence]]'', in 2002.

==Publication==
Doris Pilkington had spent much of her early life from the age of four at the [[Moore River Native Settlement]] in [[Western Australia]], the same facility the book chronicles her mother, aunt's and cousin's escape from as children. After reuniting with her family, Pilkington says she did not talk to her mother much, and she was not aware of her mother's captivity at Moore River nor the story of her escape, until her [[Daisy Kadibil|Aunt Daisy]] told her the story. Repeating the story at an Aboriginal family history event in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], one of the attendees told Pilkington he was aware of the story and that the case was fairly well-documented. He gave her some documents and clippings which formed the factual backbone of the story on which Pilkington based a first draft.&lt;ref name="quin"&gt;{{cite news|author= Quin, Karl| url= http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/resources/film/sunage17feb02.html |title=Molly's Story| work=[[The Age|The Sunday Age]]|date= 17 February 2002| accessdate= 6 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilkington submitted the draft to a publisher in 1985 but was told it was too much like an academic paper and that she should try her hand at writing fiction. Her first novel, ''Caprice, A Stockman's Daughter'', won the [[David Unaipon]] Literary Award and was published in 1990 by the [[University of Queensland|University of Queensland Press]]. Pilkington then rewrote and filled out ''Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence'' following several years of interviewing her mother and aunt, and it was published in 1996.&lt;ref name="quin" /&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Rabbit proof fence map showing route.PNG|thumb|150px|Map of the actual Rabbit-proof fence showing the trip from [[Moore River Native Settlement|Moore River]] to [[Jigalong]].]]
Molly, her half-sister Daisy and their cousin Gracie are taken to Moore River for schooling to become more like a white person and to eventually be taken to a (more) rural part of Western Australia. The girls escaped from the Settlement and took the 1,600km walk home.&lt;ref&gt;Matheo, Demetrios: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4728661/The-long-walk-home.html The long walk home], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 1 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==
{{main|Rabbit-Proof Fence (film)}}
Shortly after the book's publication, the film rights were obtained by scriptwriter Christine Olsen, who wrote the script and was persistent in her pitching of the film to [[Hollywood]]-based Australian director [[Phillip Noyce]]. Noyce agreed to direct the film, which was released in 2002 and starred [[Everlyn Sampi]] as Molly, and British actor [[Kenneth Branagh]] as [[A. O. Neville]], the [[Protector of Aborigines|Chief Protector of Aborigines]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4871">'''Frank Noel Sibley''' (28 February 1923 – 18 February 1996) was a British philosopher who worked mainly in the field of [[aesthetics]]. He held the first Chair of [[Philosophy]] at [[Lancaster University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/676714142|title=The Continuum encyclopedia of British philosophy|last=|first=|date=2006|publisher=Thoemmes Continuum|others=Grayling, A. C., Pyle, Andrew., Goulder, Naomi.|year=|isbn=9781843711414|location=Bristol|pages=|chapter=Sibley, Frank Noel|oclc=676714142}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Lancaster University|.]] Sibley is best known for his 1959 paper "Aesthetic Concepts" (''[[Philosophical review|Philosophical Review]]'', 68), and for "Seeking, Scrutinizing and Seeing" (''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', 64, 1954). Both papers (and some others) have been anthologized, "Aesthetic Concepts" multiple times. 

Sibley has been considered an important contributor to Aesthetics in the analytical tradition. His collected papers, including some posthumous, were published by Oxford University Press in 2001 as ''Approach To Aesthetics'', together with a companion volume of critical and evaluative essays on his work.

He was the uncle of the writer and broadcaster [[Brian Sibley]].

== Philosophical work==

===Aesthetics===
Most of Sibley's work in aesthetics is collected in ''Approach to Aesthetics''. He is especially well known for his attempts to distinguish the domains of aesthetic and non-aesthetic. His 1959 paper "Aesthetic Concepts" is often referred as one of the landmarks of 20th century aesthetics in the tradition of analytic philosophy. The paper is rich in themes, but the main line of thought suggests that aesthetic concepts cannot be reduced to non-aesthetic concepts, or sufficiently defined in terms of non-aesthetic concepts. This leads Sibley to think that grasping properties of given items requires the capability to exercise taste or aesthetic sensibility. 

Topics and problems relating to taste thus became very important to Sibley's approach, and he returned to them through his career. Also, Sibley did not see Aesthetics as remote from philosophy as whole. This is very clear from his brief programmatic note "About Taste", published in 1966 in ''[[British Journal of Aesthetics]]''. Here Sibley states the situation thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The programme that aestheticians must face is thus a large one, the charting of a huge areas neglected by other philosophers working within their customary bonds. Indeed, far from it's([[sic]]) being true that aesthetics is peripheral to philosophy, aestheticians encounter ranges of concepts wider than and inevitably including of those studied by most other branches of philosophy."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Philosophy of mind===

Beside aesthetics, Sibley worked on the [[philosophy of perception]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. His first published paper was a long review of [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s Concept of Mind in 1950. Later he contributed another piece on Ryle, "Ryle and Thinking", to ''Ryle: Collection of Essays''.

He wrote two papers on the theory of perception, and some papers on the borderline of that field and aesthetics, one paper on colours, and a little piece on applied philosophy. One posthumous paper deals extensively with a certain distinction made by [[Peter Geach]]. Other than these, his work was in aesthetics.

'''Gray's Pottery''', also spelled as '''Grays Pottery''' and formally known as '''A.E. Gray Ltd.''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[pottery]] company based in [[Hanley, Staffordshire]], later [[Stoke-upon-Trent]], which existed until it was taken over by [[Portmeirion Pottery]] in 1960.&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;Grant, Tina.

'''Henry Crabb Robinson''' (1775–1867) was an English lawyer known as a [[diarist]].

==Life==
Robinson was born in [[Bury St. Edmunds]], [[England]]. He was youngest son of a tanner who died in 1781; [[Habakkuk Crabb]] was his uncle. After education at small private schools, he was articled in 1790 to an [[Lawyer|attorney]] in [[Colchester]]. At Colchester he heard [[John Wesley]] preach one of his last sermons. In 1796 he entered the office of a solicitor in [[Chancery Lane]], London; but in 1798 a relative died, leaving Robinson a sum yielding a considerable yearly income. Proud of his independence and eager for travel, he went abroad in 1800. Between 1800 and 1805 he studied at various places in [[Germany]], meeting [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]] there, including [[Goethe]], [[Schiller]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]. He then became correspondent for ''[[The Times]]'' in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] in 1807. Later on he was sent to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], in [[Spain]], as a [[war correspondent]] in the [[Peninsular War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Durán de Porras |first1=Elías |title=Galicia, the Times y la Guerra de la Independencia.

On his return to [[London]] in 1809, Robinson decided to quit journalism and studied for [[Barrister|the Bar]], to which he was called in 1813, and became leader of the Eastern [[Circuit court|Circuit]]. Fifteen years later he retired, and by virtue of his conversation and qualities, became a leader in society. He was one of the founders of the London University (now [[University College London]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums/uclart/about/collections/objects/four-founders-of-ucl|title=The Four Founders of UCL|publisher=[[University College London]]|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and travelled several times to Italy, as many of his contemporaries did. Among those whom he befriended in Rome in 1829 was the novelist [[Sarah Burney]].

Robinson died unmarried, aged 91. He was buried in a vault in [[Highgate Cemetery]] alongside his friend [[Edwin Wilkins Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|last=Rigg|first=James McMullen |wstitle=Rolt, Sir John|volume=49|pages=173,174}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bust of Crabb Robinson was made, and a portrait by [[Edward Armitage]].&lt;ref name="DNB00" /&gt;

==Works==
Robinson's ''Diary, Reminiscences and Correspondence'' was published in 1869.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=319}} It contains reminiscences of central figures of the English romantic movement: including [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]], [[William Blake]], [[William Wordsworth]], and others. They are documents on the daily lives of London writers, artists, political figures and socialites. In his essay on Blake, [[Algernon Swinburne|Swinburne]] says, "Of all the records of these his latter years, the most valuable, perhaps, are those furnished by Mr. Crabb Robinson, whose cautious and vivid transcription of Blake's actual speech is worth more than much vague remark, or than any commentary now possible to give."&lt;ref name="Symons"&gt;{{cite book|last=Symons|first=Arthur|title=William Blake|publisher=E.

In 1829 Robinson was made a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] (F.S.A.), and contributed a paper to ''[[Archæologia (London)|Archæologia]]'' entitled "The Etymology of the Mass".&lt;ref name=DNB00&gt;{{cite DNB |last=Rae |first=William Fraser |authorlink=William Fraser Rae |wstitle=Robinson, Henry Crabb |volume=49 |quote=''sources:'' ''Diary, Reminiscences, and Correspondence of Henry Crabb Robinson'', by [[Thomas Sadler (Unitarian)|Thomas Sadler]]; ''Letters of Charles Lamb'', ed. Ainger.]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His diaries were bequeathed to [[Dr Williams's Library]], because Robinson had been a member of the [[Essex Street Chapel]], the first avowedly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] congregation in England.

'''Hipster''' or '''hepcat''', as used in the 1940s, referred to [[Fan (person)|aficionados]] of [[jazz]], in particular [[bebop]], which became popular in the early 1940s. The hipster adopted the lifestyle of the jazz musician, including some or all of the following: dress, slang, use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and other drugs, relaxed attitude, sarcastic humor, self-imposed poverty, and relaxed sexual codes.

==History==
[[image:Charlie Parker, Tommy Potter, Miles Davis, Max Roach (Gottlieb 06941).jpg|thumb|240px|Charlie Parker (known as Bird) at Three Deuces in New York]]
The words ''hep'' and ''hip'' are of uncertain origin, with numerous competing theories being proposed. In the early days of jazz, musicians were using the ''hep'' variant to describe anybody who was "in the know" about an emerging culture, mostly black, which revolved around jazz. They and their fans were known as ''hepcats''. By the late 1930s, with the rise of [[swing music|swing]], ''[[hip (slang)|hip]]'' rose in popularity among jazz musicians, to replace ''hep''. Clarinetist [[Artie Shaw]] described singer [[Bing Crosby]] as "the first hip white person born in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, James, "[https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200102/marcus The First Hip White Person]." 2001. ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''. Retrieved 2008-03-02&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the word ''hepster'' was used by [[Cab Calloway]] in the title of his ''Hepster's Dictionary'', which defines ''hep cat'' as "a guy who knows all the answers, understands jive". In 1944, pianist [[Harry Gibson]] modified this to ''hipster''&lt;ref&gt;"At that time musicians used jive talk among themselves and many customers were picking up on it. One of these words was hep which described someone in the know. When lots of people started using hep, musicians changed to hip. I started calling people hipsters and greeted customers who dug the kind of jazz we were playing as 'all you hipsters.' Musicians at the club began calling me Harry the Hipster; so I wrote a new tune called 'Handsome Harry the Hipster.'" -- Harry Gibson, "Everybody's Crazy But Me" (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; in his short glossary "For Characters Who Don't Dig Jive Talk", published in 1944 with the album ''Boogie Woogie In Blue'', featuring the self-titled hit "Handsome Harry the Hipster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hyzercreek.com/hipsterglossary.jpg|title=Hipster Glossary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry for ''hipsters'' defined them as "characters who like hot jazz."

Hipsters were more interested in [[bebop]] and "hot" jazz than they were in swing, which by the late 1940s was becoming old-fashioned and watered down by "[[square (slang)|squares]]" like [[Lawrence Welk]], [[Guy Lombardo]] and Robert Coates. In the 1940s, white youth began to frequent African-American communities for their [[music]] and [[dance]]. These first youths diverged from the mainstream due to their new [[philosophies]] of racial diversity and their exploratory sexual nature and drug habits. The drug of choice was marijuana, many hipster [[Glossary of jive talk|slang terms]] were dedicated to the substance.

In his book ''Jazz: A History'' (1977), Frank Tirro defines the 1940s hipster:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To the hipster, [[Charlie Parker|Bird]] was a living justification of their philosophy. The hipster is an underground man. He is to the [[Second World War]] what the [[dada]]ist was to the [[World War I|first]]. He is amoral, anarchistic, gentle, and overcivilized to the point of decadence. He is always ten steps ahead of the game because of his awareness, an example of which might be meeting a girl and rejecting her, because he knows they will date, hold hands, kiss, neck, pet, fornicate, perhaps marry, divorce—so why start the whole thing? He knows the hypocrisy of bureaucracy, the hatred implicit in religions—so what values are left for him?—except to go through life avoiding pain, keep his emotions in check, and after that, "be cool," and look for kicks. He is looking for something that transcends all this bullshit and finds it in jazz.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Marty Jezer]], in ''The Dark Ages: Life in the United States 1945–1960'' (1999), provides another definition:

{{quote|The hipster world that Kerouac and Ginsberg drifted in and out of from the mid-1940s to the early-1950s was an amorphous movement without ideology, more a pose than an attitude; a way of "being" without attempting to explain why. Hipsters themselves were not about to supply explanations. Their language, limited as it was, was sufficiently obscure to defy translation into everyday speech. Their rejection of the commonplace was so complete that they could barely acknowledge reality. The measure of their withdrawal was their distrust of language. A word like ''cool'' could mean any of a number of contradictory things—its definition came not from the meaning of the word but from the emotion behind it and the accompanying non-verbal facial or body expressions. When hipsters did put together a coherent sentence, it was always prefaced with the word ''like'' as if to state at the onset that what would follow was probably an illusion. There was neither a future nor a past, only a present that existed on the existential wings of sound. A Charlie Parker bebop solo—that was the truth.

The hipster's world view was not divided between "free world" and "Communist bloc", and this too set it apart from the then-current orthodoxy. Hipster dualism, instead, transcended geopolitical lines in favor of levels of consciousness. The division was ''hip'' and ''square''. Squares sought security and conned themselves into political acquiescence. Hipsters, hip to the bomb, sought the meaning of life and, expecting death, demanded it now. In the wigged-out, flipped-out, zonked-out hipster world, Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Truman, McCarthy and Eisenhower shared one thing in common: they were squares ... [T]he hipster signified the coming together of the bohemian, the juvenile delinquent, and the negro.}}

==Role reversal==

===Racial roles===
The new philosophy of racial role reversal was transcribed by many popular hipster authors of the time. [[Norman Mailer]]'s 1957 pamphlet, entitled "[[The White Negro]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norman Mailer, "The White Negro," Fall 1957, reprinted in Dissent, Winter 2008|url=http://www.learntoquestion.com/resources/database/archives/003327.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become the paradigmatic example of hipster ideology. Mailer describes hipsters as individuals "with a middle-class background (who) attempt to put down their whiteness and adopt what they believe is the carefree, spontaneous, cool lifestyle of Negro hipsters: their manner of speaking and language, their use of milder narcotics, their appreciation of jazz and the blues, and their supposed concern with the good orgasm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/gtmarx/www/whitenegro.html|title=The White Negro|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a nod to Mailer's discussion of hipsterism, the United States' [[Cold War]] deployments of [[African American]] culture and personalities for the purposes of [[public diplomacy]] has been discussed as "hipster diplomacy".&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, B. R., ''Artistic Ambassadors: Literary and International Representation of the New Negro Era'' ([[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]]: [[University of Virginia Press]], 2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pZET9DY05LUC&amp;pg=PT145#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 145–148].&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''''Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors''''' is a book written under the [[pseudonym]] Rex Feral and published by [[Paladin Press]] in 1983. Paladin Press owner Peder Lund claimed, in an interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'', that the book started life as a detailed crime novel written by a Florida housewife, and that the format was later changed to appeal to Paladin's reader base accustomed to the publisher's non-fiction books on military, survivalist, weapons and similar topics. The book portrays itself as a [[how-to]] manual on starting a career as a [[Contract killing|hit man]], fulfilling contracts. However, after a number of lawsuits claiming that the book was used as a handbook in several murders, the publication of the book was stopped. It marked "the first time in American publishing history that a publisher has been held liable for a crime committed by a reader."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/19990531/33480-paladin-press-pays-millions-to-settle-hit-man-case.html|title=Paladin Press Pays Millions to Settle `Hit Man' Case|last=|first=|date=May 31, 1999|work=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The families of Mildred Horn, her son Trevor, and her nurse Janice Saunders sued, claiming Paladin Press "aided and abetted" the murder. The suit, ''Rice v Paladin Enterprises'', claimed that Paladin Press had a share of responsibility in the murders by virtue of their publication of a book that, by Paladin's own admission, could be used by criminals and would-be criminals in the solicitation, planning, and commission of murder for hire. In November 1997, a U.S. appeals court ruled 3–0 that ''Hit Man'' was not protected by the free speech/free press clause of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and thus Paladin Enterprises could be held liable for a triple murder committed by one of its readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spj.org/news.asp?ref=185

On May 21, 1999, Paladin Press' insurance company agreed to settle the case out-of-court, against the wishes of Paladin Press themselves, who were confident that they would prevail in court on First Amendment grounds; however, Paladin’s insurance company balked at going to court again, figuring expenses for a lengthy trial in federal court, plus the posting of a bond in case they lost and appealed, would have cost much more than the settlement.&lt;ref name="The Murder of the First Amendment"&gt;[http://www.loompanics.com/Articles/FirstAmend.htm The Murder of the First Amendment?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Under this settlement, Paladin's insurance policy paid several million dollars to the families of those killed by the murderer, while also agreeing to destroy the remaining 700 copies of the book in their possession and surrendering any rights they had to publish and reproduce the work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Jon Ford, Paladin’s editorial director, called the settlement "economic censorship."&lt;ref name="The Murder of the First Amendment"/&gt;

The book was also cited as a source of information in a similar crime committed by Robert Vaughn Jones in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2006-02-20

The lawsuit was result of the 1998 attempted murder of Bobby Joe Wilson by her ex-husband, Robert Leslie Goggin, who allegedly hired Robert Jones to kill her in order to get money from her life insurance policy. In court, Jones testified that Goggin recruited him to kill Wilson. Jones said he then purchased &lt;i&gt;Hit Man&lt;/i&gt;. In her lawsuit, Wilson outlined two dozen points of advice from the book that Jones followed to the letter in planning to kill her. The suit was eventually settled out of court in 2002.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paladin-press.com/faqs|title=Paladin Press, Firearms, Self-Defense, Sniping, Survival, Books and DVDs|work=Paladin-press.com|accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=15793|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027062023/http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=15793|archivedate=October 27, 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=August 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
After the legal cases, Paladin no longer published the book, and allowed the remaining undestroyed circulating copies to sell out.&lt;ref name="reason" /&gt; Copies exist on the Internet (notably [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]), often accompanied by the spurious claim that the book is now in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Paladin Press claims that the rights are still held by the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/records/cohm.html|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328191849/http://www.copyright.gov/records/cohm.html|archivedate=March 28, 2007|deadurl=bot: unknown|accessdate=2007-03-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be purchased used from independent sellers. It is believed that 13,000 copies were sold, although ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason Magazine]]'' estimates there are 20,000 copies of the book in existence.

== Media ==
In 1999, a book called ''Deliberate Intent: a lawyer tells the true story of murder by the book'', was released by lawyer, author, and [[First Amendment]] scholar, [[Rodney A. Smolla|Rod Smolla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/deliberateintent00smol|title=Deliberate intent : a lawyer tells the true story of murder by the book|last=Smolla|first=Rodney A.|date=1999|publisher=New York : Crown Publishers|others=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;i&gt;Deliberate Intent&lt;/i&gt; described his involvement in the notorious "Hit Man" case, where Smolla successfully represented the families of three murder victims in the court case against Paladin Press. The book was later made into a television movie and actor [[Timothy Hutton]] portrayed Smolla.

On August 6, 2000, a [[television film]] by Fox and the FX Cable Network called ''[[Deliberate Intent]]'' was aired in the U.S. based directly on the book and the case.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2000/tv/reviews/deliberate-intent-1200464011/|title=Deliberate Intent|last=Zahed|first=Ramin|date=2000-08-02|work=Variety|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rotten Tomatoes|first=|title=Deliberate Intent (2000)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/deliberate_intent/|volume=|pages=|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It starred Timothy Hutton, [[Ron Rifkin]], [[Clark Johnson]], [[Penny Johnson Jerald]], [[Cliff DeYoung]], [[James McDaniel]], and [[Yanna McIntosh]]. Peder Lund, Paladin Press' owner, was played by [[Kenneth Welsh]]. It was directed by [[Andy Wolk]], produced by Howard Braunstein and [[Michael Jaffe]], with music by [[Harald Kloser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deliberate Intent (TV 2000)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0251662/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the drama, which clearly parallels the Horn case,&lt;blockquote&gt;The legal team then proceeds to tie the book to the case of a Motown recording engineer (McDaniel) who gets a hitman to murder his ex-wife, their paraplegic daughter{{Sic}} and the son’s nurse. By proving that the hired killer followed 22 of the 26 steps shown in Paladin’s book, they’re able to bring home the point that freedom of speech laws should not protect material that is produced for the purpose of aiding and abetting murder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Ilchi mosque''' ({{lang-fa|مسجد ایلچی}}) is a historical [[mosque]] in [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]]. The founder of this small and simple mosque was ''Saheb Soltan Beigom'', the daughter of a courtier in the [[Suleiman I of Persia|Shah Suleiman]]'s court. The mosque was built in 1686 under the supervision of Mohammad Ali ben Ostad ALibeyk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rāhnamā ye Safar be Ostān e Esfāhān(Travel Guide for the Province Isfahan)|publisher=Rouzane|isbn=964-334-218-2|author=Hosseyn Yaghoubi|editor=Arash Beheshti|page=105|language=Persian|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Perret Montres SA''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] brand of [[watchmaker]]s founded in [[Switzerland]] in 1893.

==History==
The company was founded by the Geneva-born Designer, Jean Perret in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. His successors had a long history in the watch industry dating back to 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Gisbert L. Brunner, Christian Pfeiffer-Belli, and Pfeiffer (1999). ''Wristwatches''. Könemann Verlagsgesellschaft mbH {{ISBN|3-8290-0660-8}} p.230.&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of the [[21st century]] Jean Perret Montres SA was taken over by a [[Saudi Arabia]]n investor. Today the company is held privately by a Swiss family.

==Watches==
The current collection consists of three main lines:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swisstime.ch/en-JEAN-PERRET-m32.html|title=Swisstime - JEAN PERRET|last=*|website=www.swisstime.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Slim Line, the Doublette, and the Cool Line. Jean Perret watches vary in pricing according to model and materials but range from about US$500 to about US$2,500. Models that include baguette diamonds can cost considerably more.

==Etymology==
Jericho's name in [[Modern Hebrew language|Hebrew]], {{transl|he|''Yeriẖo''}}, is generally thought to derive from the [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] word ''reaẖ'' ("fragrant"), but other theories hold that it originates in the Canaanite word for "[[moon]]" (''Yareaẖ'') or the name of the lunar [[deity]] [[Yarikh]] for whom the city was an early centre of worship.&lt;ref name=Schreiberp141&gt;Schreiber, 2003, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jericho's Arabic name, {{transl|ar|DIN|''ʼArīḥā''}}, means "fragrant" and also has its roots in Canaanite ''Reaẖ''.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bromileyp1136&gt;Bromiley, 1995, p. 1136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/Ted_Hildebrandt/OTeSources/01-Genesis/Text/Articles-Books/Waltke_CreationIV_BSac.pdf|title=The Creation Account in Genesis 1:1-3|work=Bibliotheca Sacra 132|year=1975|pages=327–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of excavations===
The first excavations of the site were made by [[Charles Warren]] in 1868. [[Ernst Sellin]] and [[Carl Watzinger]] excavated Tell es-Sultan and Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq between 1907 and 1909, and in 1911, and [[John Garstang]] excavated between 1930 and 1936. Extensive investigations using more modern techniques were made by [[Kathleen Kenyon]] between 1952 and 1958. [[Lorenzo Nigro]] and [[Nicolò Marchetti]] conducted excavations in 1997–2000. Since 2009 the Italian-Palestinian archaeological project of excavation and restoration was resumed by Rome "La Sapienza" University and Palestinian MOTA-DACH under the direction of Lorenzo Nigro and Hamdan Taha, and Jehad Yasine since 2015.&lt;ref name="lasapienzatojericho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasapienzatojericho.it|website=lasapienzatojericho.it|title=Tell es-Sultan/Jericho|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian-Palestinian Expedition carried out 13 seasons in 20 years (1997–2017), with some major discoveries, like Tower A1 in the Middle Bronze Age southern Lower Town and Palace G on the eastern flanks of the Spring Hill overlooking the Spring of 'Ain es-Sultan dating from Early Bronze III.

===Stone Age: Tell es-Sultan and its spring===
{{See also|Tell es-Sultan}}
The earliest settlement was located at the present-day Tell es-Sultan (or Sultan's Hill), a couple of kilometers from the current city. In both [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and Hebrew, ''[[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]'' means "mound" – consecutive layers of habitation built up a mound over time, as is common for ancient settlements in the Middle East and [[Anatolia]]. Jericho is the [[type site]] for the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] (PPNA) and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] (PPNB) periods.

====Natufian hunter-gatherers, {{circa}} 10,000 BC====
[[Epipaleolithic]] construction at the site appears to predate the invention of [[agriculture]], with the construction of [[Natufian culture]] structures beginning earlier than 9000&amp;nbsp;BC, the beginning of the [[Holocene]] epoch in geologic history.&lt;ref name=Freedmanp689/&gt;

Jericho has evidence of settlement dating back to 10,000&amp;nbsp;BC. During the [[Younger Dryas]] period of cold and drought, permanent habitation of any one location was impossible. However, the [[Ein as-Sultan|Ein es-Sultan]] spring at what would become Jericho was a popular camping ground for [[Natufian]] hunter-gatherer groups, who left a scattering of crescent-shaped microlith tools behind them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mithen |first=Steven |title=After the ice: a global human history, 20,000–5000 BC |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=0-674-01999-7 |page=57 |edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 9600&amp;nbsp;BC, the droughts and cold of the Younger Dryas [[stadial]] had come to an end, making it possible for Natufian groups to extend the duration of their stay, eventually leading to year-round habitation and permanent settlement.

Its cultures lacked  pottery, but featured the following:
* small circular dwellings
* burial of the dead under the floor of buildings
* reliance on hunting of wild game
* cultivation of wild or domestic cereals

At Jericho, circular dwellings were built of [[Adobe|clay and straw]] bricks left to dry in the sun, which were plastered together with a mud mortar. Each house measured about {{convert|5|m}} across, and was roofed with mud-smeared brush. Hearths were located within and outside the homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mithen|first=Steven|title=After the Ice: A Global Human History, 20,000–5000 BC|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-01999-7|page=54|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By about 9400&amp;nbsp;BC, the town had grown to more than 70 modest dwellings.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=====Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB, a period of about 1.4 millenia)=====
The following are Pre-Pottery Neolithic B cultural features, for the period from 7220 to 5850&amp;nbsp;BC (though [[carbon-14]]-dates are few and early):
* Expanded range of domesticated plants
* Possible [[Domestic sheep|domestication of sheep]]
* Apparent [[cult (religion)|cult]] involving the preservation of human skulls, with facial features reconstructed using [[plaster]], and eyes set with shells in some cases

After a few centuries, the first settlement was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase, there was a settlement hiatus of several centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]. This second settlement, established in 6800&amp;nbsp;BC, perhaps represents the work of an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten [[plastered human skulls]], painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt; These represent either [[teraphim]] or the first example of [[portrait]]ure in [[art history]],{{dubious|reason=see [[Tell Awad]] and discussion on Jericho's talk page|date=August 2013}} and it is thought that they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.&lt;ref name=Freedmanp689/&gt;&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;Janson and Janson, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumb prints to facilitate bonding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room ({{convert|6.5|x|4|m|1|abbr=on|lk=out}}{{dubious|reason=conversion via template displays unwarranted  (false) precision|date=February 2018}} and {{convert|7|x|3|m|1|abbr=on|lk=out}}){{dubious|reason=conversion via template displays unwarranted  (false) precision|date=February 2018}} with internal divisions; the rest are small, presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish [[terrazzo]]-floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors.

[[Kathleen Kenyon]] interpreted one building as a [[shrine]]. It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fitted into this niche.

The dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A [[human skull|skull]] cache contained seven skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; [[cowry|cowries]] were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modelled skulls were found in [[Tell Ramad]] and [[Beisamoun]] as well.

Other finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s, scrapers, a few [[tranchet axe]]s, [[obsidian]], and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also [[Quern-stone|querns]], hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and [[Therianthropy|theriomorphic]] clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.

In the late 4th millennium BC, Jericho was occupied during Neolithic 2{{dubious|Neol. 2 seems to be equivalent with PPNB, which ends long before M4 BC. Unless pottery appeared at Jericho later than M4, this is a mistake AND THIS BELONGS EITHER UNDER CHALCOLITHIC OR BRONZE AGE.|date=February 2016}} and the general character of the remains on the site link it culturally with Neolithic 2 (or PPNB) sites in the West Syrian and Middle Euphrates groups. This link is established by the presence of rectilinear mud-brick buildings and plaster floors that are characteristic of the age.

===Bronze Age===
A succession of settlements followed from 4500&amp;nbsp;BC onward.

====Early Bronze Age====
In the Early Bronze IIIA (c. 2700 – 2500/2450&amp;nbsp;BC; Sultan IIIC1), the settlement reached its largest extent around 2600&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt;

During Early Bronze IIIB (c. 2500/2450–2350&amp;nbsp;BC; Sultan IIIC2) there was a Palace G on Spring Hill and city walls.

====Middle Bronze Age====
{{for|the Biblical battle|Battle of Jericho}}
Jericho was continually occupied into the Middle [[Bronze Age#Near East|Bronze Age]]; it was destroyed in the Late Bronze Age, after which it no longer served as an urban centre. The city was surrounded by extensive defensive walls strengthened with rectangular towers, and possessed an extensive cemetery with vertical shaft-tombs and underground burial chambers; the elaborate funeral offerings in some of these may reflect the emergence of local kings.{{sfn|Kuijt|2012|p=167}}

During the Middle Bronze Age, Jericho was a small prominent city of the [[Canaan]] region, reaching its greatest Bronze Age extent in the period from 1700 to 1550&amp;nbsp;BC. It seems to have reflected the greater urbanization in the area at that time, and has been linked to the rise of the [[Maryannu]], a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the [[Mitanni]]te state to the north. [[Kathleen Kenyon]] reported "the Middle Bronze Age is perhaps the most prosperous in the whole history of Kna'an. ... The defenses ... belong to a fairly advanced date in that period" and there was "a massive stone [[revetment]] ... part of a complex system" of defenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kenyon|first1=Kathleen Mary|authorlink1=Kathleen Kenyon|title=Digging Up Jericho|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/DIGGING_UP_JERICHO.html?id=_z33N1QsSHEC|publisher=[[Ernest Benn Limited]]|date=1957|location=[[London, England]]|isbn=978-0510033118|pages=213–218|accessdate=26 February 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronze Age Jericho fell in the 16th century at the end of the Middle Bronze Age, the calibrated carbon remains from its City-IV destruction layer dating to 1617–1530&amp;nbsp;BC. Notably this carbon dating {{circa}} 1573&amp;nbsp;BC confirmed the accuracy of the stratigraphical dating {{circa}} 1550 by Kenyon.

====Late Bronze Age====
There was evidence of a small settlement in the Late Bronze Age ({{circa}} 1400s BC) on the site, but erosion and destruction from previous excavations have erased significant parts of this layer.&lt;ref name="Davis 2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miriam C Davis|title=Dame Kathleen Kenyon: Digging Up the Holy Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gq0YDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT121|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1315430673|page=121,126, 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jr.2009"/&gt;

===Persian and Early Hellenistic periods===
After the destruction of the Judahite city by the Babylonians in the late 6th century,{{sfn|Jacobs|2000|p=691}} whatever was rebuilt in the Persian period as part of the [[Return to Zion#The return to Zion|Restoration]] after the [[Babylonian captivity]], left only very few remains.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson"/&gt; The tell was abandoned as a place of settlement not long after this period.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson"/&gt; During the Persian through Hellenistic periods, there is little in terms of occupation attested throughout the region.{{sfn|Jacobs|2000|p=691}}

Jericho went from being an administrative centre of [[Yehud Medinata]] ("the Province of Judah") under [[Achaemenid Phoenicia|Persian rule]] to serving as the private estate of [[Alexander the Great]] between 336 and 323&amp;nbsp;BC after his conquest of the region.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In the middle of the 2nd century BC Jericho was under [[Hellenistic]] rule of the [[Seleucid Empire]], when the [[Syrian]] General [[Bacchides (general)|Bacchides]] built a number of forts to strengthen the defences of the area around Jericho against the revolt by the [[Macabees]].&lt;ref&gt;1 Maccabees 9:50&lt;/ref&gt; One of these forts, built at the entrance to [[Wadi Qelt]], was later refortified by [[Herod the Great]], who named it ''Kypros'' after his mother.&lt;ref name=Murphyp289&gt;Murphy-O'Connor, 1998, pp. 289–291.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hasmonean and Herodian periods===
{{Further|Jericho royal winter palaces}}
After the abandonment of the Tell es-Sultan location, the new Jericho of the Late Hellenistic or [[Hasmoneans|Hasmonean]] and Early Roman or Herodian periods, was established as a garden city in the vicinity of the royal estate at '''Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq''' and expanded greatly thanks to the intensive exploitation of the springs of the area.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson"/&gt; The new site consists of a group of low mounds on both banks of [[Wadi Qelt]].{{sfn|Jacobs|2000|p=691}} The Hasmoneans were a dynasty descending from a priestly group ([[Kohen|kohanim]]) from the [[tribe of Levi]], who ruled over Judea following the success of the [[Maccabean Revolt]] until Roman influence over the region brought Herod to claim the Hasmonean throne.&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, Magnus (1977). ''Archaeology of the Bible''. New York: Simon and Schuster. p. 219. {{ISBN|9780671240103}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rock-cut tombs of a Herodian- and Hasmonean-era cemetery lie in the lowest part of the cliffs between Nuseib al-Aweishireh and [[Mount of Temptation|Jabal Quruntul]] in Jericho and were used between 100&amp;nbsp;BCE and 68&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref name=Murphyp289/&gt;

====Herodian period====
[[File:Jerycho50.jpg|thumb|right|Remains from [[Herod the Great|Herod's]] palace]]
Herod had to lease back the royal estate at Jericho from [[Cleopatra]], after [[Mark Antony]] had given it to her as a gift. After their joint suicide in 30&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Octavian]] assumed control of the Roman Empire and granted Herod absolute rule over Jericho, as part of the new [[Herodian dynasty|Herodian]] domain. Herod's rule oversaw the construction of a [[hippodrome]]-theatre (''Tell es-Samrat'') to entertain his guests and new [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s to irrigate the area below the cliffs and reach his winter palaces built at the site of ''Tulul Abu el-Alaiq'' (also written '''Alayiq'').&lt;ref name=Murphyp289/&gt; In 2008 the [[Israel Exploration Society]] published an illustrated volume of Herod's third Jericho palace.&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Rozenberg; Ehud Netzer (2008).

The dramatic murder of [[Aristobulus III]] in a swimming pool at the winter palaces near Jericho, as described by the Roman Jewish historian [[Josephus]], took place during a banquet organized by Herod's Hasmonean mother-in-law. After the construction of the palaces, the city had functioned not only as an agricultural center and as a crossroad, but also as a winter resort for [[Jerusalem]]'s aristocracy.&lt;ref name="STF"&gt;[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/012discuss.html Jericho - (Ariha)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307205816/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/012discuss.html |date=7 March 2016 }} Studium Biblicum Franciscum - Jerusalem.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herod was succeeded in [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|Judea]] by his son, [[Herod Archelaus]], who built a village in his name not far to the north, [[Archelaïs]] (modern Khirbet al-Beiyudat), to house workers for his date plantation.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

First-century Jericho is described in [[Strabo]]'s ''Geography'' as follows:
{{quote|Jericho is a plain surrounded by a kind of mountainous country, which in a way, slopes toward it like a theatre. Here is the Phoenicon, which is mixed also with all kinds of cultivated and fruitful trees, though it consists mostly of palm trees. It is 100 [[stadia (length)|stadia]] in length and is everywhere watered with streams. Here also are the Palace and the Balsam Park.&lt;ref name=Murphyp289/&gt;}}

====In the New Testament====
[[File:El Greco - Christ Healing the Blind - WGA10420.jpg|thumb|250px|''Christ Healing the Blind in Jericho'', El Greco]]
The Christian [[Gospels]] state that [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] passed through Jericho where he healed blind beggars ({{Bibleref2|Matthew 20:29}}), and inspired a local chief tax-collector named [[Zacchaeus]] to [[repent]] of his dishonest practices ({{Bibleref2|Luke 19:1–10}}). The road between Jerusalem and Jericho is the setting for the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10&amp;version=NIV |title=The Parable of the Good Samaritan Luke 10:25 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wesley]], in his New Testament Notes on this section of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke's Gospel]], claimed that "about twelve thousand priests and Levites dwelt there, who all attended the service of the temple".&lt;ref&gt;Wesley, J., [http://wesley.nnu.edu/john-wesley/john-wesleys-notes-on-the-bible/notes-on-the-gospel-according-to-st-luke/#Chapter+X ''Notes on The Gospel According to St Luke'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Smith (lexicographer)|Smith]]'s ''Bible Names Dictionary'' suggests that on the arrival of Jesus and his entourage, "Jericho was once more 'a city of palms' when our Lord visited it. Here he restored sight to the blind (Matthew 20:30; Mark 10:46; Luke 18:35). Here the descendant of [[Rahab]] did not disdain the hospitality of Zaccaeus the publican. Finally, between Jerusalem and Jericho was laid the scene of his story of the good Samaritan."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/resources/smiths-bible-names-dictionary/Jericho Smith's Bible Names Dictionary: Jericho], accessed 6 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman province===
After the fall of Jerusalem to Vespasian's armies in the Great Revolt of Judea in 70&amp;nbsp;AD, Jericho declined rapidly, and by 100&amp;nbsp;AD it was but a small Roman garrison town.&lt;ref name=Loschp117/&gt; A fort was built there in 130 and played a role in putting down the [[Bar Kochba revolt]] in 133.

===Byzantine period===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 15003 Jericho synagogue mosaic.JPG|thumb|250px|Copy of Mosaic of the Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue, 6th–7th century AD]]
[[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Accounts]] of Jericho by a Christian [[pilgrim]] are given in 333. Shortly thereafter the built-up area of the town was abandoned and a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Jericho, ''Ericha'', was built 1600 metres (1&amp;nbsp;mi) to the east, on which the modern town is centered.&lt;ref name=Loschp117&gt;Losch, 2005, p. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]] took hold in the city during the Byzantine era and the area was heavily populated. A number of monasteries and churches were built, including [[St. George's Monastery, Wadi Qelt|St George of Koziba]] in 340&amp;nbsp;AD and a domed church dedicated to [[Elisha|Saint Eliseus]].&lt;ref name="STF"/&gt; At least two [[synagogue]]s were also built in the 6th century AD.&lt;ref name=Murphyp289/&gt; The monasteries were abandoned after the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] [[Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem|invasion of 614]].&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt;

The [[Jericho Synagogue]] in the Royal Maccabean winter palace at Jericho dates from 70–50&amp;nbsp;BC.

A synagogue dating to the late 6th or early 7th century AD was discovered in Jericho in 1936, and was named [[Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue]], or "peace unto Israel", after the central [[Hebrew]] motto in its mosaic floor. It was controlled by Israel after the Six Day War, but after the handover to Palestinian Authority control per the Oslo Accords, it has been a source of conflict. On the night of 12 October 2000, the synagogue was vandalized by Palestinians who burned holy books and relics and damaged the mosaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=377&amp;PID=1852&amp;IID=1923 |title=The Palestinian Authority and the Jewish Holy Sites |publisher=JCPA |date = |accessdate=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jewishjericho&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjericho.org.il/english/places/shalomalyisrael.html |title=Jewish life in Jericho |publisher=Jewishjericho.org.il |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Naaran|Na'aran]] synagogue, another Byzantine era construction, was discovered on the northern outskirts of Jericho in 1918. While less is known of it than Shalom Al Yisrael, it has a larger mosaic and is in similar condition.&lt;ref name=jewishjericho/&gt;

===Early Muslim period===
{{Further|Hisham's Palace}}
[[File:Arabischer Mosaizist um 735 001.jpg|right|thumb|[[Arab]]ic [[Umayyad]] [[mosaic]] from [[Hisham's Palace]] in Jericho]]

Jericho, by then named "Ariha" in Arabic variation, became part of [[Jund Filastin]] ("Military District of Palestine"), part of the larger province of [[Bilad al-Sham]]. The Arab Muslim historian Musa b. 'Uqba (died 758) recorded that [[caliph]] [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] exiled the Jews and Christians of [[Khaybar]] to Jericho (and Tayma).&lt;ref&gt;Several hadith collections: e.g. Bukhari, ''Sahih'' as translated Muḥammad Muḥsin Khân, ''The Translation of the Meanings of Sahih al-Bukhari'' (India: Kitab Bhavan, 1987) 3.39.531 and 4.53.380, and Muslim ''Sahih'' trans. Abdul Hamid Siddiqui (Lahore: Kazi Publications, 1976) 10.3763.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 659, that district had come under the control of [[Mu'awiya]], founder of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad dynasty]]. That year, an earthquake destroyed Jericho.&lt;ref&gt;''The Maronite Chronicle'', written during Mu'awiya's caliphate. Note that for propaganda reasons it dates the earthquake to the wrong year: Andrew Palmer, ''The Seventh Century in the West-Syrian Chronicles'' (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1993), 30, 31, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, the pilgrim [[Arculf]] visited Jericho and found it in ruins, all its "miserable Canaanite" inhabitants now dispersed in shanty towns around the Dead Sea shore.&lt;ref&gt;"The Pilgrimage of Arculf in the Holy Land", De Locis Sanctis as translated by Rev. James Rose MacPherson (W. London: BD. 24, Hanover Square, 1895), ch. I.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

A palatial complex long attributed to the tenth Umayyad caliph, [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] (r. 724–743) and thus known as [[Hisham's Palace]], is located at Khirbet al-Mafjar, about 1.5 kilometres (1&amp;nbsp;mi) north of Tell es-Sultan. This [[Desert castle|"desert castle" or ''qasr'']] was more likely built by Caliph [[Al-Walid II|Walid ibn Yazid]] (r. 743–744), who was assassinated before he could complete the construction.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Murphy-O’Connor, ''The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700'', Oxford University Press 2008, pp. 342–344.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of two mosques, a courtyard, mosaics, and other items can still be seen ''in situ'' today. The unfinished structure was largely destroyed in an earthquake in 747.

Umayyad rule ended in 750 and was followed by the [[Arab]] caliphates of the [[Abbasid]] and [[Fatimid]] dynasties. Irrigated agriculture was developed under Islamic rule, reaffirming Jericho's reputation as a fertile "City of the Palms".&lt;ref name=Shahinp285&gt;Shahin, 2005, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Muqaddasi|Al-Maqdisi]], the Arab geographer, wrote in 985 that "the water of Jericho is held to be the highest and best in all [[Islam]]. [[Banana]]s are plentiful, also [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]] and flowers of fragrant odor".&lt;ref name=Shahinp283&gt;Shahin, 2005, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Jericho is also referred to by him as one of the principal cities of Jund Filastin.&lt;ref&gt;al-Muqaddasi quoted in Le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/39/mode/1up 39]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city flourished until 1071 with the invasion of the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk Turks]], followed by the upheavals of the [[Crusades]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Crusader period===
In 1179, the Crusaders rebuilt the Monastery of St. George of Koziba, at its original site 10 kilometres (6&amp;nbsp;mi) from the center of town. They also built another two churches and a monastery dedicated to [[John the Baptist]], and are credited with introducing [[sugarcane]] production to the city.&lt;ref name=Hull&gt;Hull, 1855.&lt;/ref&gt; The site of Tawahin es-Sukkar (lit. "sugar mills") holds remains of a Crusader sugar production facility. In 1187, the Crusaders were evicted by the [[Ayyubid]] forces of [[Saladin]] after their victory in the [[Battle of Hattin]], and the town slowly went into decline.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt;

===Ayyubid and Mamluk periods===
[[File:Map of Jericho in 14c Farhi Bible by Elisha ben Avraham Crescas.jpg|thumb|14th century map of Jericho in Farchi Bible]]
In 1226, Arab geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] said of Jericho, "it has many palm trees, also sugarcane in quantities, and bananas. The best of all the sugar in the ''[[Ghaur]]'' land is made here." In the 14th century, [[Abu al-Fida]] writes there are [[sulfur]] mines in Jericho, "the only ones in Palestine".&lt;ref&gt;al-Hamawi and Abu-l Fida quoted in Le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/397/mode/1up 397]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman period===
[[File:Jerico1.jpg|thumb|right|Postcard image depicting Jericho in the late 19th or early 20th century]]
Jericho  was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517 with all of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and in 1545 a revenue of 19,000 [[Akçe]] was recorded, destined for the new [[Waqf]]  for the [[Haseki Sultan Imaret]] of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Singerp52&gt;Singer, 2002, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zHBHBTNwBQoC&amp;pg=PA50  50], [https://books.google.com/books?id=zHBHBTNwBQoC&amp;pg=PA52  52]&lt;/ref&gt; The villagers processed [[indigo]] as one source of revenue, using a cauldron specifically for this purpose that was loaned to them by the Ottoman authorities in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Singerp120&gt;Singer, 2002, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zHBHBTNwBQoC&amp;pg=PA120  120]&lt;/ref&gt; Later that century, the Jericho revenues no longer went to the Haseki Sultan Imaret.&lt;ref name=Singerp126&gt;Singer, 2002, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zHBHBTNwBQoC&amp;pg=PA126  126]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1596 Jericho  appeared in the  [[daftar|tax registers]]  under the name of ''Riha'', being in the ''[[nahiya]]'' of Al-Quds in the ''[[Liwa (Arabic)|liwa]]'' of [[Al-Quds]]. It had a population of 51 household, all [[Muslim]]s. They paid a fixed  tax-rate of 33,3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, vineyards and fruit trees, goats and beehives, water buffaloes, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 40,000 [[Akçe]]. All of the revenue still  went to a [[Waqf]].&lt;ref name=HA114&gt;Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

The French traveler [[Laurent d'Arvieux]] described the city in 1659 as "now desolate, and consists only of about fifty poor houses, in bad condition ... The plain around is extremely fertile; the soil is middling fat; but it is watered by several rivulets, which flow into the Jordan. Notwithstanding these advantages only the gardens adjacent to the town are cultivated."&lt;ref&gt;Graham, 1836, p. [https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_0ZYCAAAAQAAJ#page/n136/mode/1up 122]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, European scholars, archaeologists and missionaries visited often.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt; At the time it was an oasis in a poor state, similar to other regions in the plains and deserts.&lt;ref name=benarieh&gt;Ben-Arieh, Yehoshua.

[https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearc00smitgoog#page/n302/mode/1up   280]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Titus Tobler]] (1854) reported some 30 poor huts, whose residents paid a total of 3611 [[Kuruş]] in tax.&lt;ref&gt;[[Titus Tobler]], ''Topographie von Jerusalem und seinen Umgebungen'', Berlin, 1853–1854, p. 642&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Samuel Hershberg]] also reported some 30 poor huts and 300 residents.&lt;ref&gt;A.s. Hershberg, ''In the Land of the East'', Vilna 1899, p. 469&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Jericho was the residence of the region's Turkish governor. The main water sources for the village were a spring called ''Ein al-Sultan'' in Arabic and ''Elisha Spring'' in Hebrew, and springs in [[Wadi Qelt]].&lt;ref name=benarieh/&gt;

An [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]  village list from around 1870 showed that  ''Riha'', Jericho, had 36 houses and a population of 105, though the population count included men, only.&lt;ref&gt;Socin, 1879, p. [https://archive.org/stream/zeitschriftdesde01deut#page/159/mode/1up 159]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, 1883, p. [https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_BZobAQAAIAAJ#page/n932/mode/1up  124], noted  34 houses&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] at Tell es-Sultan was carried out in 1867, and the monasteries of St. George of Koziba and John the Baptist were refounded and completed in 1901 and 1904, respectively.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt;

===British Mandate period===
During [[World War II]] The British built fortresses in Jericho with the help of the Jewish company [[Solel Boneh]], and bridges were rigged with explosives in preparation for a possible invasion by German allied forces.&lt;ref name=Frilingp65&gt;Friling and Cummings, 2005, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of [[World War I]], Jericho came under the rule of the [[Mandatory Palestine]].

According to the [[1922 census of Palestine]], Jericho had 1,029 inhabitants, consisting of 931 Muslims, 6 Jews and 92 Christians;&lt;ref name=Census1922a&gt;Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub-district of Jericho, p. [https://archive.org/stream/PalestineCensus1922/Palestine%20Census%20%281922%29#page/n21/mode/1up  19]&lt;/ref&gt; where the Christians were 45 Orthodox, 12 Roman Catholics, 13 Greek Catholics ([[Melchites]]), 6 Syrian Catholic, 11 Armenians, 4 Copts and 1 Church of England.&lt;ref name=Census1922b&gt;Barron, 1923, Table XIV, p.

In 1927, an [[1927 Jericho earthquake|earthquake struck]] and affected Jericho and other cities. Around 300 people died,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yalibnan.com/2013/10/22/israel-hit-by-fifth-minor-quake-in-a-week/ |title=Israel hit by fifth minor quake in a week |publisher=[[Ya Libnan]] |date=22 October 2013 |accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but by the  [[1931 census of Palestine|1931 census]] the population had increased to 1,693 inhabitants, in 347 houses.&lt;ref name="Census1931"&gt;Mills, 1932, p.[https://archive.org/details/CensusOfPalestine1931.PopulationOfVillagesTownsAndAdministrativeAreas   45]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jordanian period===
Jericho came under [[Jordan]]ian control after the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. The [[Jericho Conference]], organized by King Abdullah and attended by over 2,000 Palestinian delegates in 1948 proclaimed "His Majesty Abdullah as King of all Palestine" and called for "the unification of Palestine and Transjordan as a step toward full [[Arab]] unity". In mid-1950, Jordan formally annexed the West Bank and Jericho residents, like other residents of West Bank localities became Jordanian citizens.&lt;ref name=Benvenistip27&gt;Benvenisti, 1998, pp. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the population of Jericho was  10,166,&lt;ref&gt;Government of Jordan, 1964, p.

===1967, aftermath===
Jericho has been [[military occupation|occupied]] by [[Israel]] since the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 along with the rest of the West Bank. It was the first city handed over to [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] control in accordance with the [[Oslo Accords]].&lt;ref name="csmonitor.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0914/p01s04-wome.html|title=At 10th anniversary, a far poorer Palestinian Authority|first=Ilene R.|last=Prusher|date=14 September 2004|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited Palestinian self-rule of Jericho was agreed on in the [[Gaza–Jericho Agreement]] of 4 May 1994.

In response to the 2001 [[Second Intifada]] and [[suicide bombings]], Jericho was re-occupied by Israeli troops.&lt;ref name="csmonitor.com"/&gt; A {{convert|2|m|adj=on}} deep trench was built around a large part of the city to control Palestinian traffic to and from Jericho.&lt;ref name=ARIJ&gt;ARIJ &amp; LRC, 20 March 2001, [http://www.poica.org/editor/case_studies/view.php?recordID=138 ''The Tightening of the Siege on Jericho: Israel Employs a New Policy of Trench Digging''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613235138/http://www.poica.org/editor/case_studies/view.php?recordID=138 |date=13 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 2006, the [[Israel Defense Forces]] launched [[Operation Bringing Home the Goods]], raiding a Jericho prison to capture the PFLP general secretary, [[Ahmad Sa'adat]], and five other prisoners, all of whom had been charged with assassinating the Israeli tourist minister [[Rehavam Zeevi]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4806714.stm Israel holds militant after siege] 14 March 2006 ''[[BBC News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 1536 Jericho municipality עיריית יריחו.jpg|thumb|Municipality of Jericho, 1967]]
In the first census carried out by the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS), in 1997, Jericho's population was 14,674. [[Palestinian refugee]]s constituted a significant 43.6% of the residents or 6,393 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/jer_t6.aspx Palestinian Population by Locality and Refugee Status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118181551/https://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/jer_t6.aspx |date=18 November 2008 }} [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS).&lt;/ref&gt; The gender make-up of the city was 51% male and 49% female. Jericho has a young population, with nearly half (49.2%) of the inhabitants being under the age of 20. People between the ages of 20 and 44 made up 36.2% of the population, 10.7% between the ages of 45 and 64, and 3.6% were over the age of 64.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/jer_t1.aspx Palestinian Population by Locality, Sex and Age Groups in Years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614231532/http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/jer_t1.aspx |date=14 June 2008 }} (PCBS).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2007 census by the PCBS, Jericho had a population of 18,346.&lt;ref name="PCBS"/&gt;

Demographics have varied widely depending on the dominant ethnic group and rule in the region over the past three thousand years. In a 1945 land and population survey by [[Sami Hadawi]], 3,010 inhabitants is the figure given for Jericho, of which 94% (2840) were Arab and 6% (170) were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Hadawi, 1970, [http://www.palestineremembered.com/download/VillageStatistics/Table%20I/Jerusalem/Page-057.jpg p.57]&lt;/ref&gt;
Today, the overwhelming majority of the population is [[Muslim]].&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{Citation|first=Dan|last=Fisher|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-02-02/news/mn-142_1_beit-jala/2|title=World's Oldest City Retains Lure : Biblical Jericho: Winter Oasis for the West Bank|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2 February 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Palestinian Christians|Christian]] community makes up around 1% of the population.&lt;ref name="ilsussidiario.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsussidiario.net/News/English-Spoken-Here/From-the-World/2012/5/24/HOLY-LAND-Jericho-A-small-Christian-community-and-their-school/283382/|title=HOLY LAND/ Jericho: A small Christian community and their school|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large community of black Palestinians is present in Jericho.&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 1539 The market of Jericho השוק ביריחו.jpg|thumb|250px|Jericho marketplace, 1967]]
In 1994, Israel and the Palestinians signed an economic accord that enabled Palestinians in Jericho to open banks, collect taxes and engage in export and import in preparation for self-rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/30/world/gaza-jericho-economic-accord-signed-by-israel-and-palestinians.html|title=Gaza-Jericho Economic Accord Signed by Israel and Palestinians|first=Marlise|last=Simons|date=30 April 1994|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
In 2010, Jericho, with its proximity to the Dead Sea, was declared the most popular destination among Palestinian tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/7214355/Palestinians-aim-to-push-tourism-beyond-Bethlehem.html|title=Palestinians aim to push tourism beyond Bethlehem|first=By Gavin Rabinowitz, in Bethlehem for|last=AFP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, a $150&amp;nbsp;million casino-hotel was built in Jericho with the backing of Yasser Arafat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-07-26/news/1998207031_1_casinos-austria-play-in-casinos-jericho|title=Walls going up in Jericho -- construction of casino-hotel Palestinians, Israelis have role in project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The casino is now closed, though the hotel on the premises is open for guests.

====Biblical and Christian tourism====
Christian tourism is one of Jericho's primary sources of income. There are several major Christian pilgrimage sites in and around Jericho.
* [[Mount of Temptation]], topped by a Greek Orthodox monastery with panoramic views of the region. A cable car runs up to the monastery.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt;
* the Spring of Elisha, as the [[Ein as-Sultan|Ein es-Sultan]] spring is known to Jews and Christians
* the Sycamore tree of [[Zacchaeus]] (two such trees are venerated at different locations as being related to the original tree mentioned in the Gospels)
* the nearby traditional site of the [[baptism of Jesus]] at [[Qasr el Yahud|Qasr el-Yahud]]/[[Al-Maghtas]] on the Jordan River
* the Monastery of [[Gerasimus of the Jordan|Saint Gerasimos]] known as [[Deir Hajla]]; in the Jordan Valley near Jericho
* the [[St. George's Monastery, Wadi Qelt|Saint George Monastery]] in [[Wadi Qelt]] above Jericho.

====Archaeological tourism====
The archaeological sites in and near Jericho have a high potential for attracting tourists. These are dealt with in detail in the [[Jericho#History and archaeology|History and archaeology]] paragraph:
* the Stone, Bronze and Iron Age cities at '''Tell es-Sultan'''
* the [[Hasmonean royal winter palaces|Hasmonean and Herodian winter palaces]] at '''Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq'''
* the Byzantine-period synagogues at Jericho ([[Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue]]) and [[Naaran|Na'aran]]
* the Umayyad palace at Khirbet al-Mafjar known as [[Hisham's Palace]]
* the Crusader sugar production facility at '''Tawahin es-Sukkar''' (lit. "sugar mills")
* [[Nabi Musa]], the [[Mamluk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] shrine dedicated to Moses ("Prophet Musa" to the Muslims)

===Agriculture===
Agriculture is another source of income, with banana groves ringing the city.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt;

The Jericho Agro-Industrial Park is a public-private enterprise being developed in the Jericho area. Agricultural processing companies are being offered financial concessions to lease plots of land in the park in a bid to boost Jericho's economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/18/jericho-business-park-palestine-sustainability|title=Jericho business park aims to inch Palestine towards sustainability|first=Liz|last=Ford|date=18 June 2012|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools and religious institutions==
In 1925, Christian friars opened a school for 100 pupils that became the Terra Santa School. The city has 22 state schools and a number of private schools.&lt;ref name="ilsussidiario.net"/&gt;

==Health care==
In April 2010, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) held a groundbreaking ceremony for the renovation of the Jericho Governmental Hospital. USAID is providing $2.5&amp;nbsp;million in funding for this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/wbg/pr_April_14_2010.html|title=USAID to Renovate the Jericho Governmental Hospital|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318001142/http://www.usaid.gov/wbg/pr_April_14_2010.html|archivedate=18 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
The sports team [[Hilal Areeha]] plays [[association football]] in the West Bank First Division. They play home games in the 15,000 spectator [[Jericho International Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/middle_east/countries/palestine.shtml|title=World Stadiums - Stadiums in Palestine|website=www.worldstadiums.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kendall Lewis Walton''' (born 1939) is an American [[philosopher]], the Emeritus Charles Stevenson Collegiate Professor of [[Philosophy]] and Professor of Art and Design at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/philosophy/people/professoremeritus Philosophy faculty listing], Univ. of Michigan, retrieved 2010-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt; His work mainly deals with theoretical questions about the arts and issues of philosophy of mind, metaphysics, and philosophy of language. His book ''Mimesis as Make Believe: On the Foundations of the Representational Arts'' develops a theory of make-believe and uses it to understand the nature and varieties of representation in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. "Mimesis as Make-Believe: On the Foundations of the Representational Arts". Harvard University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; He has also developed an account of photography as transparent, defending the idea that we see through photographs, much as we see through telescopes or mirrors,&lt;ref&gt;'Transparent Pictures: On the Nature of Photographic Realism' in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 79-116&lt;/ref&gt; and written extensively on pictorial representation, fiction and the emotions, the ontological status of fictional entities, the aesthetics of music, metaphor, and aesthetic value.

==Education and career==
Walton studied as an undergraduate at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], originally pursuing a major in music, having been a serious musician, probably headed towards music theory. 
However, a philosophy course in his sophomore year convinced him to change his major, tentatively, from music to philosophy. After a few more courses, he became convinced he had found his calling, stating that he had always been “more or less hooked” on philosophy, despite not knowing it by that name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2010/06/walton-on-makebelieve.html Interview at ''Only a Game'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his background in music, Walton expected that he would have an interest in aesthetics and philosophy of art, but was unmoved by his contacts with these fields at Berkeley. After graduating in 1961, he pursued postgraduate studies at [[Cornell University]] where he attended a seminar with the British philosopher and aesthetician [[Frank Sibley (philosopher)|Frank Sibley]] that he discovered “how exciting aesthetics can be, how serious, rigorous philosophical thought can connect with real, real-world interests in the arts.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2010/06/walton-on-makebelieve.html Interview at ''Only a Game'']&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote his dissertation, 'Conceptual Schemes: A Study of Linguistic Relativity and Related Philosophical Problems', with Sydney Shoemaker on philosophy of language, mind and metaphysics, and graduated in 1967 with a Ph.D.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/klwalton/files/cv-24jan10.docx Curriculum vitae] from Walton's web site.&lt;/ref&gt;

After having been invited to teach a course on aesthetics that he was not fully prepared for (having only had the one seminar with Sibley), he stayed up nearly all night brainstorming topics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2010/06/walton-on-makebelieve.html Interview at ''Only a Game'']&lt;/ref&gt; which led to his paper 'Categories of Art'.&lt;ref&gt;'Categories of Art' reprinted in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that the [[Analytic Philosophy|analytic tradition]] had not explored aesthetics at the time, he was drawn to the idea of being a pioneer, staying “That is more fun, for me, than fine tuning ideas others have worked on for decades or centuries. And I don’t have to leave behind my interests in music and the other arts”&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2010/06/walton-on-makebelieve.html Interview at ''Only a Game'']&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1965, and became Charles L. Stevenson Collegiate Professor in 1999. He was elected as a [[Fellow]] of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1998, and received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Nottingham]] in 2005. He was president of the American Society for Aesthetics from 2003 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/klwalton/files/cv-24jan10.docx Curriculum vitae] from Walton's web site.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
===Make-believe theory===
Walton's major contribution to philosophy is his theory of representation, known as the make-believe theory. In the context of ontology, the same theory is usually referred to as pretence theory, and in the context of representational arts, prop theory. Walton has been working on this philosophical theory since 1973,&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. 'Pictures and Make-Believe', The Philosophical Review (July 1973), pp.  
283-319.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is expounded in his 1990 magnum opus ''Mimesis as Make -Believe: On the Foundations of the Representational Arts''.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. "Mimesis as Make-Believe: On the Foundations of the Representational Arts". Harvard University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is a development of Ernst Gombrich's sketched ideas concerning the relationship between toys and art, presented in his famous essay 'Meditations on a Hobby Horse', which Walton has described as having been “largely ignored” by most of philosophy of art.&lt;ref&gt;'Pictures and Hobby Horses' in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Walton's theory, representational art can be understood as props that prescribe specific imaginings, analogous to the way children's toys such as dolls and teddy bears function as props in children's games of make-believe, albeit with greater sophistication.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Via certain principles of generation, any such prop generates fictional truths, which collectively constitute fictional worlds.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Walton identifies two kinds of such worlds: the game world of each participant and the work world, which can be thought of as containing only such content as is true in any well-formed game world.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', pp. 58-61&lt;/ref&gt; Props are divided into two forms: sensory depictions (such as paintings, sculpture and certain kinds of music), and verbal representations (such as novels and the spoken component of theater).&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', pp. 293-384&lt;/ref&gt;

A key clarification that the make-believe theory offers is the idea that the term 'fictional' can be taken to mean “true in the appropriate game of make-believe” or, equivalently, true in the fictional world of the representation.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Walton states that “Imagining aims at the fictional as belief aims at the true. What is true is to be believed; what is fictional is to be imagined.”&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', pp. 40-42&lt;/ref&gt; He develops this concept into an ontology of fictional objects that eliminates any “voodoo metaphysics”&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; by recognising that people sometimes refer to fictional entities ''as if'' they were referring to real entities. Walton identifies a pretence construal whereby a person ''pretends'' to describe the real world, when actually describing a fictional world.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', pp. 390-392&lt;/ref&gt;

The genesis of the make-believe theory can be found in Walton's 1978 paper 'Fearing Fictions',&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. 'Fearing Fictions', Journal of Philosophy, vol. 75, no. 1, 1978, pp. 5-27.&lt;/ref&gt; which addresses the [[Paradox of fiction]] i.e. how can we be moved by things that do not exist in the case of fiction?&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/fict-par/ 'Paradox of Fiction', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, accessed 4 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Walton's solution is to accept that our responses to fiction are genuine emotions, but to deny that they correspond to the conventional feelings that we refer to – rather, it is ''fictional'' that they are the conventional emotions. So, for instance, when a person who has watched a horror movie declares that they felt afraid, it is true that they were emotionally moved, but fictional that what they were moved to was ''fear''. Walton refers to these fictional emotions as quasi emotions.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', pp. 241-249&lt;/ref&gt;

In later papers, Walton has expanded his theory to recognize a distinction between ''content oriented make-believe'', which describes a participant's relationship to the fictional worlds of novels, films, paintings etc. and ''prop oriented make-believe'', in which the participant's interest is in the nature of the prop itself, not in the fictional world that attaches to it.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. 'Metaphor and Prop Oriented Make-Believe', European Journal of Philosophy, no. 1, 1993, pp. 39–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphors are a classic example of prop oriented make-believe: the phrase “we are in the same boat” is not intended to elicit imaginings about the fictional boat we are in, but to communicate by drawing our attention to a specific prop (the boat).&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. 'Existence as Metaphor?' in A. Everett and T. Hofweber (eds.), Empty Names, Fiction and the Puzzles of Non-Existence, Stanford, CA, CSLI Publications, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Yablo has developed Walton's concept of prop oriented make-believe in connection with numbers and concluded that our understanding of cardinality is essentially based upon fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Yablo, Stephen. 'Does Ontology Rest on a Mistake?', Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary vol. 72, no. 1, 1998, pp. 229–262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yablo, Stephen. 'Go Figure: A Path through Fictionalism', Midwest Studies in Philosophy, vol. 25, 2002, pp. 72-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses===
The make-believe theory has been described by [[Jerrold Levinson]] as “the most significant event in Anglo-American aesthetics in many a year”, and compares it to [[Nelson Goodman|Nelson Goodman's]] ''[[Languages of Art]]'' (1968), [[Richard Wollheim|Richard Wollheim's]] ''[[Art and Its Objects]]'' and [[Arthur Danto|Arthur Danto's]] ''[[Transfiguration of the Commonplace]]''  by suggesting that it “joins a small pantheon of landmark books”.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Jerrold. 'Making Believe', Dialogue: Canadian Philosophical Review, vol. 32, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simo Säätelä compared Walton's approach with the make-believe theory to that of [[Gilbert Ryle]] in ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949), albeit far wider in scope.&lt;ref&gt;Säätelä, Simo. 'Fiction, Make-Believe and Quasi Emotions',  
British Journal of Aesthetics, vol. 34, no. 1, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patrick Maynard]] has praised Walton's achievement, saying: "he has worked out a theory of representation relevant to the arts. In an age of aesthetics glib about theory, I wonder if it will be appreciated how significant an accomplishment this is."&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, Patrick. 'Real Imaginings, Walton Symposium in Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, vol. 51, no. 2, June 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The game designer and philosopher [[Chris Bateman]] has adapted the make-believe theory to games and videogames.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ihobo.com/2010/05/game-design-as-makebelieve.html "Game Design as Make-Believe] 27 May 2010. Retrieved 23 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/imaginary-games.html "Imaginary Games"], 22 February 2011. Retrieved 22 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later theories===
Walton has developed several additional philosophical theories pertaining to art. He has developed the groundwork for a theory of aesthetic value in which aesthetic pleasure is understood as being partly constituted by the admiration a participant feels for an artwork,&lt;ref&gt;'“How Marvelous!”: Toward a Theory of Aesthetic Value'' in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 3-19&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that styles in art can be understood by comparison to the adjective qualities we attach to the actions that artists apparently took in making a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;'Style and the Products and Processes of Art' in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 221-248&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, he has developed a transparency thesis of photography,&lt;ref&gt;'Transparent Pictures: On the Nature of Photographic Realism' in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 79-116&lt;/ref&gt; which is summarized in the following claim: “Photographs are ''transparent''. We see the world ''through'' them.”&lt;ref&gt;'Transparent Pictures', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Walton recognizes that this use of 'see' may differ from its conventional usage, but considers it parallel to the way we talk about 'seeing' through a telescope or other such tool.&lt;ref&gt;'Transparent Pictures', p. 85-87&lt;/ref&gt; In viewing a photograph, we thus have ''two'' related experiences: we see through the photograph to the circumstances it was originally taken, and we have a fictional experience using the photograph as a prop e.g. if one looks at a photograph of Aunt Mabel grimacing one may say “Aunt Mabel is grimacing” - it is fictional that one sees her grimacing, but in addition one actually sees through the photograph an actual grimace that she had on her face in the past.&lt;ref&gt;'Transparent Pictures', p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

''Glee'' follows the trials of the New Directions [[glee club]] at the fictional William McKinley High School in the town of [[Lima, Ohio]], of which Kurt is a member. His storylines in the [[Glee (season 1)|first season]] focus on his struggle with his sexual identity as he discloses his homosexuality to his father and friends, and deals with his romantic feelings for [[Finn Hudson]], the heterosexual co-captain of the glee club.

In the show's [[Glee (season 2)|second season]], Kurt is forced to transfer to a private school for his own safety after a [[closeted]] classmate bullies him relentlessly and then threatens to kill him. Kurt joins the Dalton Academy Warblers, the school's glee club, which is a competition rival of New Directions, and is befriended by their openly gay lead singer [[Blaine Anderson]]. Later on, the two become romantically involved. Their relationship has been well received by critics, and they have been named "one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium" by Jarett Wieselman of the ''[[New York Post]]''.&lt;ref name="NYP"/&gt; Kurt eventually transfers back to McKinley and rejoins New Directions, but continues his relationship with Blaine, who transfers to McKinley in the [[Glee (season 3)|third season]]. In the [[Glee (season 4)|fourth season]], Kurt moves to New York City with his best friend and rival [[Rachel Berry]], where he pursues his musical education while interning for [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue.com]]. For the remainder of the series, ''Glee'' charts Kurt's life in Lima and New York as he grapples with young adulthood and realising his career ambitions.

Colfer describes Kurt as projecting a very confident "I'm better than you" personality, despite being a typically scared and anxious teenager.&lt;ref name="starry"/&gt; Kurt's solos for New Directions tend to be songs—usually [[show tunes]]—traditionally performed by women, which best suit his countertenor voice. His occasionally complex—but always loving—relationship with his father has been a focus for the show. Colfer's portrayal of Kurt has received much critical praise, and he has been the recipient of several awards, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor&amp;nbsp;– Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film]] at the 2011 [[Golden Globe Awards]]. He has also garnered many award nominations, which include the 2010 and 2011 [[Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]]. In April 2011, Colfer was named one of the 2011 [[Time 100]], [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]'s list of the 100 most influential people.

==Casting and creation==
Prior to being cast in ''Glee'', Colfer had no professional acting experience.&lt;ref name="rewrite"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-gleestage26-2009apr26,0,1653470.story | title=Video: 'Glee' team rewrites the school musical | first=Denise |last=Martin | work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]] | date=April 26, 2009 | accessdate=May 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He originally auditioned for the role of [[Artie Abrams]], performing "[[Chicago (musical)#Musical numbers|Mr. Cellophane]]" from the musical ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him.&lt;ref name="bs" /&gt; To keep the number of students in the glee club constant, a character named Rajish was cut from the show.&lt;ref name="huluvid"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/77856/glee-up-close-with-chris-colfer| title=Glee: Up Close with Chris Colfer |work=[[Hulu]].com|publisher=[[Fox Entertainment Group|Fox]]| accessdate=March 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt's name is inspired by the character Kurt von Trapp from ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', a role that Colfer once played as a child.&lt;ref name="rewrite"/&gt; The Hummel surname comes from the popular German [[Hummel figurines]]; Colfer explained in an interview that Murphy thought he had their rosy-cheeked complexion.&lt;ref name="huluvid2"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/154679/late-night-with-jimmy-fallon-chris-colfer-part-1| title=Late Night with Jimmy Fallon: Chris Colfer, Part 1 |work=[[Hulu]].com|publisher=[[NBC]]|accessdate=March 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy praised Colfer's abilities despite his lack of formal training, saying, "I just thought he was so talented and gifted and unusual.

Colfer added, "For him to see me in him, I can't even describe it."&lt;ref name="LAtimesblog"/&gt;

After being cast, Colfer said that he was happy "to be a part of something that is so new and different and so needed at this time", and added, "It's good to have something positive, especially for kids in small towns, like myself, who need a little pick-me-up."&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-glee26-2009apr26,0,7366573.story | title= Will TV audiences watch with 'Glee'? | last=Fernandez|first=Maria Elena | work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]| date=April 26, 2009 | accessdate= June 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt has twice been portrayed as a child: in the episode "[[Grilled Cheesus]]", a series of flashback scenes show Kurt at the age of eight, in which the character is played by Adam Kolkin.&lt;ref name="zap2it"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/10/glees-young-kurt-meet-adam-kolkin-chris-colfers-mini-me.html | title={{-'}}Glee's Young Kurt: Meet Adam Kolkin, Chris Colfer's mini-me | first=Carina | last=MacKenzie | work=[[Zap2it]] | publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]] | date=October 5, 2010 | accessdate=February 27, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314095411/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/10/glees-young-kurt-meet-adam-kolkin-chris-colfers-mini-me.html | archivedate=March 14, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kolkin was thirteen at the time of the audition, which called for an eight-year-old, he was chosen in part because his resemblance to Colfer was "so uncanny even the casting directors were taken aback".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/kolkin-268628-glee-kurt.html|title=O.C. teen to play younger Kurt on 'Glee{{'-}}|last=Fletcher|first=Jaimee Lynn|work=[[The Orange County Register]]|publisher=[[Freedom Communications]]|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt has also been shown even younger—in the episode "[[The Substitute (Glee)|The Substitute]]", club director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) comes down with the flu and has a hallucination of the students as preschoolers; all twelve glee club members, including Kurt, are played by very young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20302134_20442631_20877628,00.html|title=Mini-'Glee'! 12 Cast Faves...as Kids!|date=November 16, 2010|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|accessdate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot." He also revealed that some of the original cast would leave as early as 2012: "I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives."&lt;ref name="replaced"/&gt; Murphy stated in July 2011 that Colfer would be one of the actors leaving at the end of the third season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/glee-lea-michele-chris-colfer-210869|title={{-'}}Glee' Exclusive: Lea Michele, Chris Colfer, Cory Monteith Not Returning for Season 4|first=Lesley|last=Goldberg|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=July 12, 2011|date=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Colfer commented on the report, saying, "We had kind of known since the beginning, since we started the show, that these characters were going to grow up and they were going to graduate eventually. I don't think I thought it was going to happen so soon, necessarily, but I think we knew something like this was coming."&lt;ref name="fired"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/112429_Chris_Colfer_Found_Out_He_Was_Leaving_Glee_on_Twitter/|title=Chris Colfer Found Out He Was Leaving 'Glee' on Twitter|last=Hirsch|first=Lisa|work=[[Entertainment Tonight]]|publisher=[[CBS Television Distribution]]|date=July 14, 2011|accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Falchuk later said that while Colfer, along with [[Lea Michele]] and [[Cory Monteith]], would graduate at the end of the third season, their graduation did not mean that they would leave the show.

==Storylines==

===Season 1===
In the show's [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]], Kurt auditions for the New Directions glee club by performing "Mr. Cellophane" from ''Chicago''. Although he initially hides his [[homosexuality]], many of the other members assume he is gay. He confides that he is gay to fellow glee club member [[Mercedes Jones|Mercedes]] ([[Amber Riley]]) in "[[Acafellas]]", and the two develop a close friendship.&lt;ref name="Acafellas"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Acafellas |episodelink=Acafellas |series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=John Scott (director), [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 16, 2009 |season=1 |number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Preggers"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Preggers |episodelink=Preggers (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director, writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 23, 2009 |season=1 |number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following episode, "[[Preggers (Glee)|Preggers]]", Kurt joins the school football team as a [[Kicker (American football)|kicker]] in order to impress his widowed father, [[Burt Hummel]] ([[Mike O'Malley]]), and helps the failing team win its first game by kicking the tie-breaking extra point. His heightened confidence leads him to disclose his homosexuality to his father, who not only responds with love and acceptance, but also surprises Kurt by telling him that he has long been aware that Kurt was gay.&lt;ref name="Preggers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kurt-bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com/glee/bios/chris-colfer/ |title=Chris Colfer as Kurt Hummel |work=Fox.com |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]] |accessdate=January 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/656DXoF92?url=http://www.fox.com/glee/bios/chris-colfer/ |archivedate=January 31, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt quits the football team in "[[Mash-Up (Glee)|Mash-Up]]", when Coach [[Characters of Glee#Ken Tanaka|Ken Tanaka]] ([[Patrick Gallagher (actor)|Patrick Gallagher]]) forces the glee club members of the team to choose between the club and the team.&lt;ref name="Mash-Up"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Mash-Up |episodelink=Mash-Up (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits= [[Elodie Keene]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=October 21, 2009 |season=1 |number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt competes against the glee club's star singer [[Rachel Berry]] (Lea Michele) for a solo on "[[Defying Gravity (song)|Defying Gravity]]" from the musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]''.

Kurt introduces his father to Finn's mother [[Carole Hudson|Carole]] ([[Romy Rosemont]]) in the hope that if the two began dating, it would bring Kurt closer to Finn.

During the ensuing argument, when Kurt refuses to acknowledge his infatuation, Finn loses his temper and calls the new furnishings "faggy".

After Burt points out that Kurt may be taking advantage of Sam, Kurt terminates the partnership, and performs a "duet" with himself, singing "Le Jazz Hot!" from ''[[Victor Victoria]]''. With unusual empathy, Rachel notices how lonely and unhappy Kurt seems, and realizes how hard it is for him to be the only publicly gay student at school. She reminds Kurt that the club members value him highly and that he is not alone, and asks him to sing the [[Judy Garland]] / [[Barbra Streisand]] duet of "[[Get Happy (song)|Get Happy]]" and "[[Happy Days Are Here Again]]" with her.&lt;ref name="Duets"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/duets,46184/|title=Duets|last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|work=[[The A.V.

Kurt and Rachel decide they want to apply to a top school for the dramatic arts in New York City, NYADA, but are intimidated when they meet some of their competition and decide their applications need to include more accomplishments: Rachel proposes that McKinley do ''[[West Side Story]]'' as the school musical so she can star in it, and Kurt runs for class president.&lt;ref name="Purple"&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Purple Piano Project|episodelink=The Purple Piano Project|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Eric Stoltz]] (director), [[Brad Falchuk]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 20, 2011 |season=3 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brittany volunteers to be his campaign manager, and he accepts, but when he objects to her suggestions for posters and paraphernalia as overemphasizing his sexuality, she decides to run for the office herself.&lt;ref name="Unicorn"&gt;{{cite episode |title=I Am Unicorn|episodelink=I Am Unicorn|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director), [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 27, 2011 |season=3 |number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt tries out for the musical, but the directors aren't convinced that he's masculine enough to portray Tony, the romantic male lead, and cast Blaine instead, even though he's only a junior; Kurt is given the minor role of Officer Krupke.&lt;ref name="Unicorn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asian F"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Asian F|episodelink=Asian F|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Alfonso Gomez-Rejon]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=October 4, 2011 |season=3 |number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Rachel believes that she might not be cast as Maria, the female lead, she panics and decides to run for class president as well, infuriating Kurt.&lt;ref name="Asian F"/&gt; She eventually withdraws and throws her support behind Kurt, and secretly decides to help him further by stuffing the ballot box in his favor.

In "[[The First Time (Glee)|The First Time]]", Kurt and Blaine discuss whether or not to [[have sex]]. When Blaine goes to Dalton to invite the Warblers to see him in ''West Side Story'', he is pursued by a new warbler Sebastian Smythe ([[Grant Gustin]]). Sebastian convinces Kurt and Blaine to go with him to a local gay bar—he supplies the fake IDs—and spends half the night dancing with Blaine. When they leave, a drunk and aroused Blaine urges Kurt to have sex with him in the back seat of the car. Kurt refuses, and Blaine walks home. He later tells Kurt that he was just nervous about the possibility of their first time, and that he cares nothing for Sebastian. They kiss onstage in the empty auditorium, and Kurt proposes that they go over to Blaine's house for the night, where they have sex together for the first time.&lt;ref name="First Time"&gt;{{cite episode |title=The First Time|episodelink=The First Time (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Bradley Buecker (director), [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 8, 2011 |season=3 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "[[Michael (Glee)|Michael]]", New Directions and the Warblers compete for the right to perform Michael Jackson's music at Regionals by singing his song "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]". Sebastian, who has been unsuccessful in his attempts to steal Blaine from Kurt, throws a slushie laced with rock salt at Kurt, but Blaine jumps in front of Kurt and is badly injured by it; the cornea in his right eye is deeply scratched and requires surgery.&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Michael|episodelink=Michael (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Alfonso Gomez-Rejon]] (director), [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=January 31, 2012 |season=3 |number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither group ultimately uses Jackson's music at Regionals, and New Directions wins the competition. Later, Kurt succeeds in becoming a finalist for NYADA, as does Rachel.&lt;ref name="On My Way"&gt;{{cite episode |title=On My Way|episodelink=On My Way (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Bradley Buecker (director), [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=February 21, 2012 |season=3 |number=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Dance with Somebody (Glee)|Dance with Somebody]]", Kurt feels that Blaine has been distant, and confides in a boy named Chandler he meets at the local music store. The two hit it off instantly with their common interest of moving to New York after high school. Kurt begins texting Chandler quite often soon after that. Rachel thinks he's being in the wrong that Kurt is cheating on Blaine instead of talking to Blaine about the rut they are in. Blaine finds out about Chandler and is extremely hurt. Both Kurt and Blaine sing Whitney songs to express how they feel about their situation with Blaine singing [[It's Not Right but It's Okay]] and Kurt singing [[I Have Nothing]] as an apology. Eventually after having a talk in Emma's office, the two make up and are stronger than ever.&lt;ref name="Dance with Somebody"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Dance with Somebody|episodelink=Dance with Somebody (Glee)|series=Glee|serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Paris Barclay (director), [[Ross Maxwell]](writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=April 24, 2012 |season=3|number=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Goodbye (Glee)|Goodbye]]", Blaine is worried that he and Kurt will not make it as a couple after Kurt graduates and moves off to New York. Kurt reassures him that they will be okay as a couple. After graduation, Kurt, Rachel and Finn's letters from the New York schools they applied to come in. Kurt does not get accepted to NYADA.&lt;ref name="Goodbye"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Goodbye|episodelink=Goodbye (Glee)|series=Glee|serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Brad Falchuk (director), [[Brad Falchuk]](writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=May 22, 2012 |season=3|number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 4===
In Season 4, Kurt joins Rachel in New York after she reveals that she is unhappy with her roommate and life at that point. After the encouragement of Blaine and his father, he decides to sell his car and fly to New York, where he finds a loft in Bushwick for him and Rachel to move into. Kurt applies for a job at Vogue.com and his editor, Isabelle Wright, who is also from Ohio, hires him partially based upon his portfolio of outfits and is impressed with his intuition and style. Early on, she leans on his support, and then quickly returns his support when he decides to give Rachel a makeover in the Vogue closet. Instead of being angry, she loves his idea to do a musical makeover for the website and joins in the makeover. Kurt becomes increasingly busy with his job at Vogue, and Blaine cheats on him in Lima. He comes to New York to tell Kurt what happened, and they break up.

Kurt continues working at Vogue throughout the season, and Isabelle encourages him to try to forgive Blaine, and at Thanksgiving, she brings her friends over to their loft and throws him a "kiki." When Kurt reauditions for NYADA, he is initially rejected, because Carmen Tibideaux sees his technical skill and tells him that he can sell a number, but doesn't believe that he is emotional enough to be an artist. Later, when Kurt is at the Winter Showcase to support Rachel, she sees him moved by Rachel's piece, and announces that he will be auditioning after the intermission. Though he initially panics, Rachel convinces him that he doesn't need his bells and whistles to perform, and he chooses to sing "Being Alive" from Company, which impresses the NYADA audience, and he later gets a letter telling him that he has gotten in.

At Christmas, Kurt elects not to go back home, and so his father comes up to New York to set up his Christmas tree and spend some time with him. At this point, he tells Kurt that he has prostate cancer. He also has brought Blaine with him, who tries to win back Kurt's trust, but the trip is uneasy. When Kurt begins at NYADA, he struggles initially to find his place, and meets a student named Adam Crawford, a senior who wants to recruit him for his own show choir, Adam's Apples, and also seems interested in Kurt himself; Kurt eventually asks him out for coffee. While at Will and Emma's wedding, Kurt and Blaine hook up, leaving their relationship in a question, since Kurt is dating Adam, but not exclusive. When Kurt returns to New York, there is a snowstorm, leaving Kurt, Rachel, Santana, and Adam stuck together in the loft watching movies together. Santana strongly hints about Kurt's hook up with Blaine, and after they are back at school, Adam asks Kurt about his feelings for Blaine. Kurt says that he is desperately trying to get over Blaine, and Adam invites him to find their own romantic movie.

When Santana moves in with him and Rachel, Kurt tries to keep Santana from telling Rachel about Brody prostituting himself. But Santana tells Rachel anyway, much to Kurt's dismay. Later, Kurt and Rachel confront Santana for working at a club dancing and try to encourage her to take a dance class from the extension school of NYADA to keep her skills honed. Still working at Vogue, Kurt is put in charge of a ballet gala, and invites Rachel and Santana to help. He and Rachel reveal that they both had experiences with ballet as children, and Kurt started ballet at the age of three years when his mother decided to take him. He bribes Santana to go with a designer dress, and once they are at the gala, she admits she was in ballet as a child too and loved it. When Kurt returns to Lima, it is to be there for his father's doctor's visit, and his anxiety is apparent throughout his interactions with his friends. However, in the doctor's office, Kurt, Burt, and Carole learn that Burt's cancer has gone into remission, and Kurt takes his father to the Glee club to sing "Sunshine of My Life" to him, which Kurt says Burt used to sing to him when he was little.

===Season 5===
In the season premiere, "[[Love, Love, Love (Glee)|Love, Love, Love]]", Kurt, who is still in Lima, agrees to get back together with Blaine. Emboldened, Blaine decides to ask Kurt to marry him, which he does in an extravagant proposal at Dalton Academy, in the spot where the two met. Kurt accepts.&lt;ref name="Love, Love, Love"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Love, Love, Love|episodelink=Love, Love, Love (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Bradley Buecker (director), [[Brad Falchuk]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 26, 2013 |season=5 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is back in New York in "[[Tina in the Sky with Diamonds]]", and gets a job at the diner where Rachel and Santana are working. He then returns to Lima in "[[The Quarterback (Glee)|The Quarterback]]" for his stepbrother Finn's funeral and subsequent memorial, and he grieves with his parents and friends.&lt;ref name="The Quarterback"&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Quarterback |episodelink=The Quarterback (Glee) |series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director, writer), [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=October 10, 2013 |season=5 |number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt was still living in New York, but he was visiting his father in Lima

===Season 6===
During the season, Kurt and Blaine have broken up but eventually reunite in time for Brittany and Santana's wedding. At the two's insistence, Kurt and Blaine get married alongside them. In 2020, they are still married and are a celebrity couple. Rachel is pregnant with their child who is assumed to be a girl.

==Characterization==
[[File:Ryan Murphy by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The scene where Kurt comes out is taken verbatim from the life of ''Glee'' creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (''pictured'').]]
According to Colfer, ''Glee''{{'}}s creators initially "were leaning on [Kurt] being overly flamboyant". However, the actor stated that he did not want to take that approach "because it's so overdone". Instead, he decided to portray the character as "more internal and superior."&lt;ref name="LAtimesblog"/&gt; Colfer has explained that Kurt "puts on a very confident, 'I'm better than you' persona," but that "underneath it all he's the same anxious and scared teen everyone is/was at some point." Colfer also commented, "In later episodes, [Kurt] goes through an identity crisis, accepting and finding acceptance for who he is. He's a tough guy in designer clothes."&lt;ref name="starry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://starrymag.com/content.asp?ID=4321&amp;CATEGORY=INTERVIEWS |title=Chris Colfer&amp;nbsp;— Pure Glee |last=Steinberg|first=Jamie |work=Starry Constellation Magazine|date=May 2009|accessdate=June 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrasting Kurt to his own personality, Colfer stated that Kurt is "very flamboyant and superior and uppity and into fashion", while Colfer had never heard of fashion designer [[Marc Jacobs]] before Kurt referenced him in the pilot episode.&lt;ref name=Colfertvinterview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/chris-colfer,41850/ |title=Chris Colfer |last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|date=June 7, 2010|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|publisher=[[Onion, Inc.|Onion, Inc]]|accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second-season episode "Grilled Cheesus" centered around Kurt's [[atheism]], with Murphy explaining that Kurt is "saying to the world, 'Prove [me] wrong: If God is kindness and love, make me believe in God.{{' "}}&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Glee-Grilled-Cheesus-1023969.aspx?rss=news&amp;partnerid=spi&amp;profileid=05|title=Are You There, God? Glee's Twist on Faith|first=Denise|last=Martin|work=[[TV Guide]]|publisher=[[Lions Gate Entertainment]]|date=October 4, 2010|accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt reveals himself to be gay early in the show's first season. The scene in which he tells his father was taken verbatim from Murphy's own life. Murphy felt that the scene was "a great thing to put on television", because, while gay characters are often isolated and attacked, audiences have rarely seen an openly gay character who "wins and triumphs".&lt;ref name="Colfer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/09/entertainment/et-colfer9|title={{-'}}Glee's' Chris Colfer fits right in|last=Fernandez|first=Maria Elena|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=September 9, 2009|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further explained, "The show is about making you feel good in the end. It's about happy endings and optimism and the power of your personal journey and making you feel that the weird thing about me is the great thing about me. I've done other shows with gay characters, and I will say that in many of those cases, the gay characters didn't have a happy ending. And I thought you know what? Enough."&lt;ref name="Colfer"/&gt; Colfer has commented that his biggest challenge was in ensuring the scene felt "honest" and not comical or "used as a punchline". He explained, "I think it's probably the first time a character's sexuality has been respected and almost dignified in a way, and I think that's really important, and there needs to be more of that on TV."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2009/11/chris_colfer_on_playing_kurt_i.html|title=Glee's Chris Colfer on Owning 'Defying Gravity' and Resembling a Hummel Figurine|last=Milzoff|first=Rebecca|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=New York Media Holdings|date=November 16, 2009|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt’s acute sense of fashion is exhibited in his on-screen wardrobe. ''Glee''{{'}}s costume designer [[Lou Eyrich]] said in an interview with the ''[[Seattle Times]]'' that Kurt is one of her favorite characters to dress: "He never, ever repeats and you get to push yourself creatively. He's a perfect doll to dress because he'll try on anything."&lt;ref name="costume design"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/television/2011667814_glee25.html|title=Costume designer Lou Eyrich keeps 'Glee' fashions in step with the times|first=Sarah|last=Glassman|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]]|date=April 24, 2010|accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eyrich sets out to dress Kurt with tailored pieces that "exude his quietly flashy dapper dandyism",&lt;ref name="cdm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.costumedesignersguild.com/articles/2010-aug-spotlight-on-lou-eyrich/ |title=Spotlight On Lou Eyrich "Glee{{"-}} |first=Anna |last=Wyckoff |work=Costume Designers Guide.com |publisher=[[Costume Designers Guild]] |date=August 2, 2010 |accessdate=March 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216122454/http://www.costumedesignersguild.com/articles/2010-aug-spotlight-on-lou-eyrich/ |archivedate=February 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; mindful that as the son of a car mechanic, "he doesn't have a lot of money".&lt;ref name="fresnobee"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fresnobee.com/2010/08/27/2056263/glee-emmy-nomination-a-team-effort.html|title={{-'}}Glee' Emmy nomination a team effort |first=Rick|last=Bentley|work=Fresnobee.com|publisher=[[The Fresno Bee]]|date=August 30, 2010|accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nypost9"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/go_inside_kurt_closet_4BXS8iUipIQKRur8XLdsIO|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130130045337/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/go_inside_kurt_closet_4BXS8iUipIQKRur8XLdsIO|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 30, 2013|title=Go inside Kurt's closet|first=Jarett|last=Wieselman|work=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=September 15, 2010|accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Kurt has a close relationship with his father Burt, who openly accepts his son after Kurt tells him that he is gay in the show's fourth episode, "Preggers". As the series progresses their relationship continues to grow stronger. Colfer has credited his off-screen relationship with O'Malley with improving the quality of their scenes together.&lt;ref name="MastersCC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b178380__i_Glee__i__s_Chris_Colfer__There_s_More_Daddy_Drama_to_Come.html|title=Glee's Chris Colfer: There's More Daddy Drama to Come|last=Masters|first=Megan|work=[[E!

The first occurrence is initially alluded to in the episode "Acafellas", in which Kurt tells his friend Mercedes that he does have feelings for someone. Mercedes mistakenly assumes that Rachel, the glee club's lead singer, is the object of Kurt's affections, and although he later tells Mercedes that he is gay, he does not reveal to her that he is actually in love with the club's male lead, Finn.&lt;ref name="Acafellas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b127287_glees_coming-out_episode_respectful.html|title=Glee's Coming-Out Episode: "Respectful &amp; Touching{{"-}}|last=Borzillo-Vrenna|first=Callie|work=[[E!

The episode in which Burt defends his son against Finn's name-calling prompted a response from Eric Goldman of ''[[IGN]]'', who declared it "one of the heaviest scenes ''Glee'' has ever delved into".&lt;ref name="theatri review"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/109/1093143p1.html |title=Glee: "Theatricality" Review |last=Goldman|first=Eric |work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]] |date=May 26, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2009/10/01/glee-season-1-episode-4-tv-recap/|title={{-"}}Glee" Season 1, Episode 4: TV Recap |last=Flandez|first=Raymund|date=October 1, 2009|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|accessdate=October 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before production on the second season began, Murphy confirmed that Kurt would be paired with a new romantic interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/01/18/exclusive-glee-spoilers-rachel-puck/|title=Exclusive: 'Glee' boss on Rachel/Puck relationship, Kurt's new BF, and Madonna!|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|authorlink=Michael Ausiello|last2=Malkin|first2=Mark|date=August 31, 2010|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chord Overstreet, his character Sam Evans was originally intended to become Kurt's love interest. However, Sam's storyline was later adjusted to pair him with glee club member [[Quinn Fabray]] ([[Dianna Agron]]) after producers observed the chemistry between Overstreet and Agron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/10/audio-glees-chord-overstreet-says-sam-went-gay-straight|title=Audio: Glee's Chord Overstreet Says 'Sam' Went From Gay To Straight|work=[[RadarOnline]]|date=October 13, 2010|accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt was subsequently paired with another new character, Blaine Anderson, a member of the rival show choir group the Dalton Academy Warblers, who is initially a mentor for Kurt. Murphy was unsure at first whether their relationship would become a romantic one, and stated that he wished to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, "Part of me thinks he should be the boyfriend, part of me thinks he should just be the mentor. I didn't want to decide that until we got into sort of the middle of the season."&lt;ref name="AE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterelton.com/people/2010/11/glee-ryan-murphy-darren-criss-kurt-hummel |title=Exclusive!

In a July 2012 interview with ''[[E! News]]'', Colfer elaborated in regard to the progression of the Kurt-Blaine relationship in the show's fourth season. Colfer said, "I would like to do something besides say 'I love you,' and I think Darren [Criss] and I agree on that. We're ready for the next step. They've been together for a while.

To begin the show's fourth season, Kurt moves to New York while Blaine continues to go to high school in Ohio, though he and Blaine remain a couple. However, after Blaine cheats on him, Kurt breaks up with Blaine. The two later agree to remain friends, though Kurt is unwilling to resume their relationship. That winter, Kurt begins to see Adam Crawford, a senior at his new school, NYADA. Despite this, Kurt has sex with Blaine when in Ohio to attend a wedding, putting into question whether Kurt still wants to be with Blaine.

Despite all this, Kurt and Blaine do get back together in a romantic relationship in the first episode of the fifth season, "Love Love Love", which is incidentally the same episode that Blaine proposes marriage. Kurt says yes immediately.

Kurt heads back to New York while Blaine finishes high school back in Lima. Eventually, midway through the fifth season, Blaine graduates and moves in with Kurt. They have difficulties and agree that it would be best for them to continue with their engagement but as Blaine lives somewhere else for now as they both need their space. They will cohabitate in the season five finale.

At the beginning for the sixth season, it seems as though Kurt and Blaine have broken off the engagement due to difficulties living together and Blaine has moved back to Lima. Kurt later regrets this and decides to continue his schooling in Lima, to try to win Blaine back.

When Kurt returns, he finds that Blaine is in a relationship with Karofsky. Despite everything that goes on in the beginning of the sixth season, Kurt and Blaine get back together in the beginning of the episode, "A Wedding". Later in the same episode, Brittany and Sue Sylvester persuade the couple to get married at Brittany and Santana's wedding to make a double gay wedding.

They continue through the rest of the sixth season as a wed couple and in the season six finale, "Dreams Come True", it is revealed that five years in the future, Rachel is carrying their child, a daughter.

==Musical performances==

I know I'm definitely not the best singer, but I think the message, the story behind the song about defying limits and borders placed by others, hopefully all that gets across with the performance.

In "Grilled Cheesus", when members of the glee club are singing songs about religion and spirituality, Kurt sings The Beatles' "[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]", dedicating the song to his father, who is in a coma in the hospital.

Kurt has received mainly positive reviews from television critics.

Critics were polarized by Kurt's storyline in the episode "Never Been Kissed". ''[[NPR]]''{{'s}} [[Linda Holmes (writer)|Linda Holmes]] found it "absurd" that a teenager as deeply in denial as Karofsky would transition from bullying to kissing Kurt so quickly and described it as "emotionally and behaviorally unsound".&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2010/11/10/131212955/why-glee-missed-the-mark-with-the-much-hyped-never-been-kissed?ft=1&amp;f=93568166|title=How 'Glee' Missed The Mark With The Much-Hyped 'Never Been Kissed{{'-}}|first=Linda|last=Holmes|work=Monkey See|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=November 11, 2010|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leah Anthony Libresco of the ''[[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post]]'' called the episode "extraordinarily counterproductive", and disapproved of Will treating Kurt's upset as the key problem, rather than the unchecked bullying provoking it. She found Blaine's advice to Kurt "misleading and dangerous", especially the suggestion that targeted children should be held responsible for confronting their attackers and putting themselves at risk of further injury, rather than for protecting themselves.&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leah-anthony-libresco/glees-gay-suicide-psa-it_b_781815.html|title=Glee's Gay Suicide PSA: It Got Worse|first=Leah Anthony|last=Libresco|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=November 10, 2010|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poniewozik noted that the storyline was inherently flawed, as the show had previously treated bullying in a light-hearted rather than serious manner, but said that its saving grace was the focus it placed on Colfer: "probably the strongest actor with the most interesting character among the ''Glee'' kids".&lt;ref name="JP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2010/11/10/glee-watch-bully-pulpit/|title=Glee Watch: Bully Pulpit|first=James|last=Poniewozik|authorlink=James Poniewozik|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|date=November 10, 2010|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The love story involving Kurt and Blaine was met with critical acclaim, especially the events in the "Original Song" episode where the characters first kissed.

Critics were enthusiastic about Kurt and Blaine's decision to have sex for the first time in "The First Time" episode.

The '''Madrid system''' (officially the '''Madrid system for the international registration of marks''') is the primary international system for facilitating the registration of trademarks in multiple jurisdictions around the world. Its legal basis is the multilateral [[treaty]] ''Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks'' of 1891, as well as the ''Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement'' (1989).

The Madrid system provides a centrally administered system of obtaining a bundle of trademark registrations in separate jurisdictions. Registration through the Madrid system does not create a unified registration, as in the case of the European Union trade mark&lt;ref&gt;Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 of 26 February 2009 on the Community trade mark (Official Journal No. L78, 24.3.2009, p.1)&lt;/ref&gt; system; rather, it creates a bundle of national rights through an international registration able to be administered centrally.  Madrid provides a mechanism for obtaining trademark protection in many countries around the world which is more effective than seeking protection separately in each individual country or jurisdiction of interest.

The Madrid Protocol system provides for the international registration of trade marks by way of one application that can cover more than one country. The opportunity of having a single registration to cover a wide range of countries gives advantages, both in terms of portfolio management and cost savings, as opposed to a portfolio of independent national registrations.

Madrid now permits the filing, registration and maintenance of trade mark rights in more than one jurisdiction, provided that the target jurisdiction is a party to the system. The Madrid system is administered by the International Bureau of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. There are 90 countries part of the Madrid System.

== History and development ==
{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
The Madrid system comprises two treaties; the ''Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks'',&lt;ref group="fn"&gt;The full name of the Madrid Agreement is the "Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks of April 14, 1891 (as revised at [[Brussels]] on December 14, 1900, at [[Washington, DC|Washington]] on June 2, 1911, at [[The Hague]] on November 6, 1925, at [[London]] on June 2, 1934, at [[Nice]] on June 15, 1957, and at [[Stockholm]] on July 14, 1967, and as amended on September 28, 1979)".&lt;/ref&gt; which was concluded in 1891, and entered into force in 1892, and the ''Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement'', which came into operation on 1 April 1996. The Madrid Agreement and Madrid Protocol were adopted at diplomatic conferences held in [[Madrid, Spain]].

The Madrid Agreement was originally intended to provide for an international registration system, but did not achieve this for two significant reasons:

* The lack of international acceptance. Many non-member countries, including the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Central America]]n, [[South America]]n and [[Asia]]n countries, such as [[Japan]], were not adherents, which undermined recognition of the system as a truly "international" regime. Significantly, many of these countries represent the largest numbers of trademark filings and registrations in the world; and
* The mere forwarding by the International Bureau of a uniform application to member countries, rather than the registration of the applicable trademark in the national trademark registers, precludes an actual "registration" system.

Some of the large trading nations like the United States, Japan, and [[Canada]], which have a large number of filings at the national level, did not join the Madrid Agreement due to another perceived flaw in the system:  if the home registration upon which an international registration was based came under 'central attack', the international registration would be cancelled or limited to the same extent that the home registration was cancelled or limited.

During 1966 and 1967, attempts were made to address this issue by establishing a new treaty that would reflect the need of the times rather than the world of the 1890s when the agreement was adopted. This led to the drafting of the Trademark Registration Treaty (TRT) which was adopted in [[Vienna]] in 1973, and entered into effect in 1980, with five contracting states, namely, [[Burkina Faso]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Gabon]], [[Soviet Union]] and [[Togo]]. In the absence of more accessions to the TRT and the low number of registrations since its inception, it was clear that the TRT was unlikely to supplant the Madrid Agreement.

As the realization of the introduction of a multi-jurisdictional (or at least pan-European) European [[Community Trade Mark]] (CTM) approached, the relevancy of the Madrid system came under scrutiny. Pressure increased on [[WIPO]] to maintain its relevance and strengthen the agreement by increasing membership, possibly through amendments. This culminated in the introduction of the Madrid Protocol, pursuant to which a CTM registration could be a 'foundation' or 'home' registration upon which an international registration could then be established. This mechanism is referred to as a "linking provision." The Protocol, after considerable lobbying efforts by WIPO, was signed by many countries, including most of the present members of the Madrid Agreement, and some countries that are members of the European Union, but were not members of the Madrid Agreement.  The Protocol entered into force on December 1, 1995 and became operative on April 1, 1996.

Many countries have needed to modify or consider modifying their trademark laws in order to adhere to the Protocol, in addition to the modifications required by [[GATT]]-[[TRIPS]]/[[World Trade Organization|WTO]].

In Europe, resistance to the Protocol was brought by trademark attorneys who were afraid of losing business because a [[Community Trade Mark]] application could be filed directly through the Madrid Protocol process.&lt;ref name="inta042003"&gt;[http://www.inta.org/Advocacy/Documents/INTAMadridProtocolUSImpact.pdf Report by the International Trademark Association, April 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the proposal bogged down due to a trademark dispute between two businesses who were heavy campaign contributors to certain Congressmen, followed by a repeated reshuffling of the Senate due to elections and a subsequent defection of a Republican senator.&lt;ref name="inta042003"/&gt; The treaty was eventually ratified during the Presidency of [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;WIPO web site, [http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/madrid_marks.pdf List of Members of the Madrid System]&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan revised its trademark law with the official acceptance of the [[International (Nice) Classification of Goods and Services|Nice Classification]] (an international trademark classification system for products and services), as well as applications covering service using [[service marks]]. The members of the [[European Community]] have amended their laws to conform to the [[European Community Harmonization Directive]]. In recent years trademark laws in several other countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]] have also been amended to accommodate the changes. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Members ==
[[File:Madrid Protocol 2018.svg|thumb|right|400px|Madrid Union members]]

{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
Adherence to the convention or the protocol includes membership of the "Madrid Union." As of April 2016 there are 97 members. The original treaty has 55 members, all of which are also party to the protocol (when Algeria joined the Madrid Protocol on October 31, 2015, all of the members of the Madrid Agreement were also members of the Madrid Protocol and many of the aspects of the Madrid Agreement ceased to have practical effect).  The term 'Madrid Union' can be used to describe those jurisdictions party to either the Agreement or the Protocol (or both).&lt;ref name="wipo"&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/madrid_marks.pdf WIPO.int]&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary reason the protocol—which has been in operation since 1996 and has 100 members&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/members/]&lt;/ref&gt; — is more popular than the agreement — which has been in operation for more than 110 years and has 55 members&lt;ref name="wipo" /&gt;—is that the protocol introduced a number of changes to the Madrid system which significantly enhanced its usefulness to trademark owners.

For example, under the protocol it is possible to obtain an international registration based on a pending trade mark application, so that a trade mark owner can effectively apply for international registration concurrently, or immediately after, filing an application in a member jurisdiction. By comparison, the agreement requires that the trade mark owner already holds an existing registration in a member jurisdiction, which may often take many months and sometimes years to obtain in the first place. In addition, the agreement does not provide the option to 'convert' international registrations which have been 'centrally attacked.'

== Advantages ==
{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
The Madrid system provides a mechanism whereby a trademark owner who has an existing trademark application or registration (known as the 'basic application' or 'basic registration') in a member jurisdiction may obtain an 'international registration' for their trademark from the WIPO.  The trademark owner may then extend the protection afforded to the international registration to one or more member jurisdictions, a process known as 'designation'. A useful feature of the Madrid system is that this protection may generally be extended to additional jurisdictions at any time, such that international trade mark protection can be extended to new jurisdictions which subsequently join Madrid, or to such other jurisdictions as the trade mark owner may choose.

In basic terms, the primary advantage of the Madrid system is that it allows a trademark owner to obtain trademark protection in any or all member states by filing one application in one jurisdiction with one set of fees, and make any changes (e.g. changes of name or address) and renew registration across all applicable jurisdictions through a single administrative process.

== Disadvantages ==
{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
One disadvantage of the Madrid system is that any refusal, withdrawal or cancellation of the basic application or basic registration within five years of the registration date of the international registration will lead to the refusal, withdrawal or cancellation of the international registration to the same extent. For example, if a basic application covers 'clothing, headgear and footwear,' and 'headgear' is then deleted from the basic application (for whatever reason), 'headgear' will also be deleted from the international application. Therefore, the protection afforded by the international registration in each designated member jurisdiction will extend only to 'clothing and footwear.' If the basic application is rejected as a whole, the international registration would also be totally refused.

The process of attacking the basic application or basic registration for this purpose is generally known as 'central attack.' Under the Madrid Protocol, the effects of a successful central attack can be mitigated by transforming the international registration into a series of applications in each jurisdiction designated by the international registration, a process known as 'transformation.' Although transformation is an expensive option of last resort, the resulting applications will receive the registration date of the international registration as their filing date.

In 1997, less than half of a percent of international registrations were canceled as a result of central attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en World Intellectual Property Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost savings which usually result from using the Madrid system may be negated by the requirement to use local agents in the applicable jurisdiction if any problems arise.

== Developments since 2000 ==
{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
Two significant recent developments in international trademark law were the accession of the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]] to the Madrid Protocol on November 2, 2003, and October 1, 2004, respectively. With the addition of these jurisdictions to the protocol, most major trading jurisdictions have joined the Madrid system.

On 31 July 2015, [[Algeria]] deposited its instrument of accession and will accede to the Madrid Protocol on 31 October 2015. As Algeria was the last member of the Madrid system to adhere to the protocol, the protocol is now effective across the entire Madrid system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/news/2015/news_0016.html Algeria Joins the Madrid Protocol], ''WIPO'', 7 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11341">'''Minus Space''' is an art gallery located in [[Dumbo, Brooklyn]], NY. It specializes in [[abstract art]] and [[reductive art]].

==History==
Minus Space began as an online [[curator]]ial and critical project presenting reductive and [[conceptual art|concept based art]]. Reductive art includes [[geometric abstraction]], artwork that deals with repetition, [[monochrome painting|monochrome]] or limited color, [[serial art|seriality]].&lt;ref name=brennan&gt;''Neighborhood Beat'': Profile on Minus Space &amp; Michael Brennan, BCAT / Brooklyn Community Access Television, January 25, February 14, February 19, and February 23, 2007, Episode 31&lt;/ref&gt; and [[minimalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalm, James. "A Boom Grows in Brooklyn", ''The Brooklyn Rail'', July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also characterized by the use of plain-spoken materials, precise craftsmanship and intellectual rigor.&lt;ref name=ps1&gt;''Minus Space: The Art of Reduction'', P.S. 1 Newspaper, Fall / Winter 2008, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It was launched as an online curatorial project in August 2003 by Brooklyn [[artist]]s Matthew Deleget and Rossana Martinez, and gradually developed into a showcase for dozens of artists.&lt;ref&gt;Maine, Stephen. “Dateline Brooklyn”, ''Artnet Magazine'', April 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; They began by putting portfolios and curating exhibitions online. Minus Space published interviews of artists, reviews and critical essays. At this point project was only online, literally ''minus space''.&lt;ref name=brennan/&gt;

Minus Space then started to produce physical exhibitions in their Brooklyn project space.&lt;ref name=brennan/&gt; These included one person shows of [[abstract painting]], [[installation art|installations]] and [[performance art]].&lt;ref name=mshome&gt;Minus Space, home page. 17 June 2008. &lt;www.minusspace.com/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition they began to curate exhibitions nationally and internationally at [[university|universities]], galleries, [[artist-run space]]s and nonprofit spaces located in [[Manhattan]]; [[St. Mary's City, Maryland]]; [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]];&lt;ref name=brennan/&gt; [[Houston, Texas]];&lt;ref name=ml&gt;''Machine Learning'', exhibition catalog, The Boyden Gallery of St. Mary's College of Maryland, The Painting Center, Gallery Sonja Roesch and Minus Space, 2007. inside cover.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brussels|Brussels, Belgium]].&lt;ref name=mshome/&gt;

Minus Space opened their initial gallery space at 98 Fourth Street in Gowanus in April 2006.&lt;ref name=maine&gt;Maine, Stephen. “The Reductive Expands: Minus Space will move from 175 feet in Gowanus to a Dumbo loft”, Artcritical, September 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, they relocated to a gallery-filled building at 111 Front Street in Dumbo.&lt;ref name=maine/&gt;

[[Hyperallergic]] selected the Minus Space exhibition 'Roberta Allen: Works from the 1970s" as "Best of 2014: Top 10 Brooklyn Art Shows."&lt;ref&gt;Best of 2014: Our Top 10 Brooklyn Art Shows, Hyperallergic, December 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions and curatorial projects ==
In 2008, [[MoMA PS1]] exhibited ''''Minus Space – The Art of Reduction'', a survey of 54 artists from 14 countries affiliated with Minus Space. The exhibition was curated by [[Phong Bui]], [[publisher]] of the [[Brooklyn Rail]] and P.S. 1 curatorial advisor. The exhibition marked the 5th anniversary of Minus Space.&lt;ref&gt;Minus Space, home &lt;www.minusspace.com/index.htm#projectspace&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Minus Space also curated an exhibit to ''re-present'' abstract [[shaped canvas]] paintings as new, made by Mark Dagley first shown with [[Tony Shafrazi]] Gallery 20 years earlier in 1987. Most of the exhibition of was painted in [[William S. Burroughs]] Bunker in the [[Bowery]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mark Dagley'', exhibition catalog, Minus Space, Abaton Book Company, 2008. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

They curated a traveling exhibition ''[[Machine Learning]]'' which was shown at the Boyden Gallery of [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]], The Painting Center in New York City, Gallery Sonja Roesch in Houston, TX in 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name=ml/&gt;  The title of the exhibition was inspired by a subfield of [[artificial intelligence]] concerned with the design and development of [[algorithms]] that allow computers to ''learn''. Machine learning algorithms recognize patterns within massive sets of data. Real world applications include the [[internet]] [[Web search engine|search engine]]. This exhibition examined new pattern painting in the information age.&lt;ref&gt;''Machine Learning'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Minus Space organized the group exhibition, Escape from New York, which originated at Sydney Non Objective, [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], in 2007, later traveled to [[Curtin University]] in [[Perth]] in 2008, Project Space Spare Room, [[RMIT University]] in Melbourne in 2009, and then to The Engine Room, [[Massey University]], [[Wellington, New Zealand]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;SNO. &lt;www.sno.org.au/s/SNO_30_catalog.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Minus Space exhibited [[album covers]] designed by [[Josef Albers]] along with ephemera and documentation from the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation demonstrating the record jackets as firsthand projects in abstract [[applied art]].&lt;ref&gt;Masheck, Joseph. “Albers’ Record Jackets: Doing an Artful Job”, The Brooklyn Rail, December 2009/January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Minus Space exhibited a collection of vintage issues of [[Life (magazine)]] representing the magazine’s historical coverage of modern art, including the 1949 article, “[[Jackson Pollock]]: Is he the greatest living painter in the United States?,” alongside works by the artist [[Loren Munk]] addressing both the history of [[New York School (art)]] and the field of [[art criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Panero, James. “Gallery Chronicle,” The New Criterion, January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Minus Space organized, in collaboration with artist John Zinsser, a large survey exhibition examining the history and legacy of gallerist Julian Pretto (1945-1995) and his downtown New York galleries, active during the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s. The exhibition featured the work of more than 40 national and international artists in an array of different media, including painting, drawing, sculpture, installation, video, and poetry. &lt;ref&gt; Russeth, Andrew.

The '''National Union of Bibliophiles''' ('''NUB'''), full name Non-Commercial Partnership “The National Union of Bibliophiles” ({{lang-ru|Некоммерческое партнерство “Национальный союз библиофилов”}}), is a public organisation, an association of bibliophiles of the Russian Federation. It was formed as legal entity in 2010.

==History of foundation==

NUB’s history starts in 1990, when the Organisation of Russian Bibliophiles, ORB ({{lang-ru| Организация российских библиофилов, ОРБ}}) was chartered, which had united on an informal basis around 100 lovers of antique rare books.
A successful 20-years period of the life of ORB (it organised more than 10 exhibitions and issued over 200 printed works) was finalized in 2010. A need for substantial changes in the structure and activities of the organisation was the key driver for the bibliophiles’ decision to set up a new association in the form of a legal entity – the Non-Commercial Partnership “The National Union of Bibliophiles”, which effectively has become a successor to the Organisation of Russian Bibliophiles. The founders’ meeting of NUB was held on 22 October 2010 in Moscow at the State Literature Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsb-bibliophile.ru/nsb-v-pechati.html Seslavinsky M.V. Bibliophilic community // Book: Researches and Materials. – M.: Nauka, 2002, - Vol. 99. - Parts 1-2 [Chief Editor B.V.Lensky.- 2013. –pp. 217-226]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 January 2011 the first general participants meeting of NUB was held in Moscow, where the Partnership Board comprising five members was formed by secret ballot. A prominent Moscow bibliophile and researcher in book culture, Head of the Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation [[Mikhail Seslavinsky|Mikhail Vadimovich Seslavinsky]] was elected Head of the Partnership Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rg.ru/2011/02/03/knigi.html Alperina S.

==Membership==

Currently there are about 100 members in NUB.

Among the members of NUB there are prominent scientists, journalists and writers including Pavel Gusev - Chief Editor of newspaper “Moskovsky komsomolets” ({{lang-ru| Московский комсомолец}}) and Head of Moscow Union of Journalists, Alexander Sigov, - Academician of Russian Academy of Sciences, [[Konstantin Ernst]] – producer, Director General of the Channel One (Russian: Первый канал), Villy Petritsky – culturologist, one of the patriarchs of Russian bibliophilia, Lev Mnukhin – researcher of Marina Tsvetaeva’s work and history of Russian emigration, Yuri Rostovtsev -  Chief Editor of the monthly “Studenchesky meridian” (“Student meridian”) ({{lang-ru|  Студенческий меридиан}}), Olga Tarakanova – professor, author of the only Russian textbook “Antiquarian book”, Mikhail Afanasyev – Director of the State Historical Public Library of Russia and others. They are all united by the passion for collecting and research of rare books.

==Activities==

NUB’s activities are dedicated to bringing together people interested in book collecting, aggregation and dissemination of information about Russian bibliophile movement, extending the boundaries of the Russian book culture and facilitation of private book collecting practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echo.msk.ru/programs/time/756860-echo The scent of old book. Radio Echo of Moscow programme from the cycle “Unpassed time” by M.Peshkova]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the aegis of NUB there were organised International Scientific Conferences “Bibliophilia and Private Collections” (2011, 2013),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasledie-rus.ru/podshivka/9824.php Egorov B.

Information program “Observer”, Kultura channel&lt;/ref&gt;

The partnership organises and holds annual meetings of its members, at which it arranges round table discussions dedicated to various historical events, including the 400th anniversary of the House of Romanov (2013), the 200th anniversary of the Patriotic War of 1812 (2012), the 125th anniversary of the birth of Anna Akhmatova (2014) etc.

Starting from 2013 NUB, jointly with the Russian bibliophilic magazine [["Pro knigi" ("About books")]] ({{lang-ru| Про книги. Журнал библиофила}}), presents an annual award in the name of  N. Smirnov-Sokolsky for the personal contributions to the development of Russian bibliophilia.

NUB participates in the work of national and international book fairs and exhibitions, where it distributes scientific and bibliophilic printed works of limited editions.

==Clubs==

Members of the partnership are involved in the work of more than 10 bibliophile clubs located at various cities of Russia, Ukraine and Israel, where they are engaged in the research activities in the area of theory and history of rare books.

In Moscow the club “Bibliophilic Hive” ({{lang-ru| Библиофильский улей}}) (Hosted by M.V.Seslavinsky) is in active operation.

The subject matters of the meetings are dedicated to the history of Russian bibliophilia (including outstanding book collections of the past), art of the book and book cover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svobodanews.ru/content/transcript/3545687.html Bibliophilia as a passion. Radio Svoboda programme from the cycle “Myths  and reality” by Ivan Tolstoy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The artist’s book at the Christie’s auction&lt;/ref&gt; Among the permanent participants of the meetings, apart from the bibliophiles, are representatives of libraries and museums, antique traders and collectors. Some meetings are arranged jointly with the largest Russian museums and libraries including the State Literature Museum, the Russian State Library, the State Historical Public Library of Russia, the National Pushkin Museum, Anna Akhmatova Museum at Fountain House (Fontanny Dom) and others.

In 2012-2013 for the first time in the history of Russian bibliophilia there were organised joint sessions of the bibliophilic clubs of Moscow and  Saint-Petersburg ).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ng.ru/fakty/2012-11-01/3_nocturne.html Safronova K. Nocturne of Tsarskoye Selo on Moika embankment// Nezavisimaya gazeta. Ex Libris. 2012. 1 Nov.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each session is accompanied by a daylong exhibition of rare printed works from the collections of the participants of the club. During 2011-2013 the sessions’ results were described in the illustrative booklets (20-45 pages each) containing the principal theses of presentations made at the meetings, and from 2014 the club’s magazine “Vestnik bibliophila” (“Herald of the Bibliophile”) ({{lang-ru| Вестник библиофила}}) is published.

The '''Opéra de Nice''' is the principal opera venue in [[Nice]], France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opera-nice.org/ Opéra de Nice official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

It offers three types of performances: operas, ballets and classical concerts ; and houses the Ballet Nice Méditerrannée and the Nice Philharmonic Orchestra.

==History==
The “petit théâtre en bois” (wooden theatre) was first created in 1776 by Marquess Alli-Maccarani. Sold in 1787 to a group of gentry,&lt;ref name="paris"&gt;Pâris, Alain. Opéra de Nice. In: ''Dictionnaire des interprètes''. Éditions Robert Laffont, Paris, 1995, p1152-53.&lt;/ref&gt;  it reopened in 1790 under the name “Théâtre Royal”.

In 1826, the city of Nice, encouraged by King [[Charles Felix of Sardinia|Charles Félix]], bought it from its owners and had it demolished and rebuilt. It was inaugurated in 1828 with [[Giovanni Pacini]]'s ''Il Barone di Bolsheim''.

In 1856, a great ball was organized in the honour of King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]].

In 1860, [[Napoleon III]] was invited to attend an evening at the Théâtre Royal. For this special occasion, [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]] led the orchestra. The same year, the theatre became the “Théâtre Impérial”. In 1864, Napoleon III returned, accompanied by Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]]. In 1868, [[Louis II, Duke of Bavaria]] attended a performance of ''[[Cendrillon (Isouard)|Cendrillon]]''. The Théâtre Royal was renamed “Théâtre Municipal” in 1870.

On Wednesday, March 23rd 1881, as the opera ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' began, a gas leak started a huge fire. The fire was controlled the next day but there was nothing left of the theatre. Three siblings of [[Marjory Kennedy-Fraser]] died in the fire: Lizzie, Kate and James (soprano, contralto and baritone respectively).
The city of Nice immediately decided to rebuild another theatre on the same site. It was designed by architect François Aune with the apparent approval of [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], the architect of the Paris Opera.&lt;ref name="paris"/&gt; On February 7th 1885, the Théâtre Municipal re-opened with [[Verdi]]’s ''[[Aida]]''.&lt;ref name="IvanAA"&gt;Alexandre. Ivan A. Nice pour mémoire. ''[[Diapason (magazine)|Diapason]]'' 649, September 2016, p9.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following years it hosted the French stage premieres of operas such as ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'', ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'', ''[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]'', ''[[Manon Lescaut (Puccini)|Manon Lescaut]]'', ''[[Marie-Magdeleine]]'', ''[[Katerina Ismailova]]'' and ''[[Elegy for Young Lovers]]''.&lt;ref name="paris"/&gt; Artistic directors included [[Edoardo Sonzogno]] (1887-88), [[Raoul Gunsbourg]] (1889-91) and Ferdinand Aymé (1950-82). Musical directors included [[Alexandre Luigini]] (1888-89 and 1897-98), [[Albert Wolff (conductor)|Albert Wolff]] (1930-32 and 1934-37), [[Antonio de Almeida (conductor)|Antonio de Almeida]] (1976-78) and [[Pierre Dervaux]] (1978-82).&lt;ref name="paris"/&gt;

In 1902, it was named Opéra de Nice and is today referred to as Opéra Nice Côte d’Azur.

With the support of the Médecin family of Nice, the house flourished, attracting major singers and directors in opera, but despite the efforts of [[Jean-Albert Cartier]] from 1994-1997, the importance of the house declined.&lt;ref name="IvanAA"/&gt;

==21st century==
From 2001 to 2009 the director-general was the Belgian producer Paul-Émile Fourny. He was succeeded by Jacques Hédouin, with a policy of closer working with the [[Opéra de Monte-Carlo]], as well as closer collaboration with the two regional orchestras, the Orchestre Philharmonique de Nice and the Orchestre régional de Cannes-Provence-Alpes-Côte-d’Azur.&lt;ref&gt;Fauchet B. Nice people. ''[[Diapason (magazine)|Diapason]]'' 572S, September 2009, p9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, Marc Adam became the new artistic director of the opera. The same month tenor [[Jonas Kaufmann]] performed there. Adam departed in 2015 to be replaced by Eric Chevalier.&lt;ref name="IvanAA"/&gt;

The Diacosmie is the workshop of the Opéra de Nice, where everything from costumes to sets is created. The building also houses rehearsal rooms for the Nice Philharmonic Orchestra and the Ballet Nice Méditerrannée.

'''Pia Colombo''' (born [[Homblières]], Aisne, France; 6 July 1934 – died 16 April 1986) was a French singer of Franco-Italian origin, been born '''Eliane Marie Amélie Pia Colombo''' who acted in radio, cinema and television between 1956 and 1981.&lt;ref name="Piaf et colombe"&gt;Cf. Archives du nouvel Observateur: ''Chanson: Piaf et colombe'' – Article de Michèle Manceaux (en 1 pleine page) paru dans Le Nouvel Obs 109 du 14 décembre 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father was from [[Milan]] and her mother came from the [[Nord (French department)|Nord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rioux|first1=Lucien|title=Variétés : Une Héroïne de la Chanson|issue=228|publisher=Le Nouvel Obs|date=24 May 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
She was compared to [[Édith Piaf]] and was believed to be her successor when Piaf died in 1963 but Colombo was too intellectual for the taste of the general public.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Path ==
Politically committed, Colombo was a big interpreter of the work of her husband, the composer Maurice Fanon, and of [[Serge Gainsbourg]], [[Jacques Brel]], [[Georges Brassens]], [[Kurt Weill]], [[Hanns Eisler]] and others.

In the 1960s she acted in [[Roger Planchon]]'s productions of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s works.

She acted in the [[Théâtre National Populaire|Popular National Theatre]], [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]], [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia of Paris]], Bobino, [[Festival d'Avignon]] and popularised the songs of [[Léo Ferré]].&lt;ref&gt;A cette époque, il a été condamné au silence par sa maison de disques (Source: lalalala.org -Voir [http://www.lalalala.org/piacolombonoframe.html La biographie de Pia Colombo par Didier Dahon] consultée le 12 mars 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

Archives du nouvel Observateur: ''Les rendez-vous Spectacles'' – Brève parue dans Le Nouvel Obs N°784 du 19 novembre 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombo died of cancer when 51 years old and her body is buried in the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10612">'''Rachel Gadsden''' is a UK-based [[visual artist]] and [[performance artist]] who is exhibited internationally and who works across the mainstream and [[disability art]] sectors. Gadsden has led a range of national and international participative programmes exploring themes of fragility and resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gadsden|first1=Rachel|title=Disability Arts International|url=http://www.disabilityartsinternational.org/artists/profiles/rachel-gadsden/|website=Disability Arts International|publisher=British Council|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has had a lung condition all her life and is injected by a syringe driver at one-minute intervals with the medication she needs to keep her alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gadsden|first1=Rachel|title=Push Me Please|url=http://www.pushmeplease.co.uk/biographical-information-rachel-gadsden/|website=Push Me Please|publisher=Watershed|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Gadsden's artistic career began with the support of a [[Prince's Trust|Prince's Youth Business Trust Award]] (1988). Gadsden received a BA (Hons) Fine Art Painting from [[Wimbledon School of Art]] in 1998, an Anatomy for Artists Diploma from UCH Medical School, London in 2000 and MA Fine Art, [[City and Guilds of London Art School]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gadsden|first1=Rachel|url=http://www.rachelgadsden.com/rg-about|title=Homepage|website=Rachel Gadsden}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wsimag.com/art/1365-rachel-gadsden|title=Wall Street International|last=|first=|date=21 October 2016|website=Wall Street International Art Section|publisher=Wall Street International|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Gadsden’s artistic process explores the physical, historical and personal experience of aspects of the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=GV Art London Catalogue|last=Devcic|first=Robert|publisher=GV Art London|year=2012|isbn=978-0-9575418-1-8|location=London|pages= |page=6|quote="...explores the human condition and gives voice to the notions of fragility, survival and hope."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimenting with what the artist calls a [[Psychogeography|psycho-geographical]] approach she explored the derelict asylum Cane Hill in Surrey in 2005. In documenting the process Tim Hayton said: “Rachel's mixed media paintings, drawings, projections and videos attempt to capture the building's struggle to survive and its inevitable physical demise, the decay being a tangible evocation of our own psychological ephemerality.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/rachel-gadsden-beyond-the-asylum|title=Disability Arts Online|last=Hayton|first=Tim|date=1 October 2005|website=Disability Arts Online|publisher=Disability Arts Online|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Gadsden received an Artsadmin Digital Media Bursary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsadmin.co.uk/artist-development/featured/artists-bursary-scheme|title=Artsadmin|last=|first=|date=21 October 2016|website=Artsadmin|publisher=Artsadmin|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to develop a project narrating a history of [[North Wales Hospital]] in Denbigh. Ten years after the closure of the hospital an exhibition of her artwork Beyond the Asylum was shown in Denbigh Museum and Library, North Wales (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/4209506.stm|title=BBC News|last=|first=|date=3 September 2005|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Faith Gallery, Holton Lee, Dorset (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rachelgadsden.com/rg-about|title=Rachel Gadsden|last=|first=|date=21 October 2016|website=Artists' About Page|publisher=|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011/12 Gadsden exhibited [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]] as part of a GV Art London Group Show 'TRAUMA: The Art and Science of Trauma'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gvart.co.uk/trauma.html|title=GV Art London|last=|first=|date=21 October 2016|website=GV Art Trauma Group Show|publisher=GV Art London|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was in line with GV Art’s commitment to support artists who generate meaningful collaborations and dialogues with scientists to investigate the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gvart.co.uk/about-2.html|title=GV Art London|last=|first=|date=|website=GV Art London ABOUT page|publisher=GV Art London|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gadsden exhibited artwork from her initial collaboration with The Bambanini Group of Khayelitsha Township investigating the experience of living with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=TRAUMA: The Art and Science of Trauma|last=|first=|publisher=GV Art|year=2011|isbn=978-0-9563783-6-1|location=London|pages=49–52|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition also included Luke Jerram’s glass microbiology sculptures of HIV.

In 2012 Gadsden won an award from the Arts Council’s Unlimited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/unlimited-iii|title=ACE|last=|first=|date=|website=Arts Council|publisher=Arts Council England|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; programme, designed to support disabled artists across the UK to create ambitious work covering all genres.

Working with the Bambanani Group in South Africa, Unlimited Global Alchemy explored the psychology and politics of HIV/AIDS through a series of collaborative artworks, film and workshops. Work from the project is now permanently exhibited in Mandela’s Walk to Freedom in Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rachelgadsden.com/rg-about|title=Rachel Gadsden About Page|last=Gadsden|first=Rachel|date=21 October 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luke Jennings in a Guardian review of Gadsden's project Unlimited Global Alchemy said: “Gadsden is creating an artwork with frantic speed, fighting her own real-life fight against the dying of the light. In the act of painting, she tells us, she is "living in the second". A profoundly affecting reminder of our shared humanity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jennings|first1=Luke|title=Unlimited Global Academy – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/09/unlimited-global-academy-livid-review|accessdate=3 December 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 an exhibition catalogue of Unlimited Global Academy was published by Artsadmin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unlimited Global Alchemy|last=Mitchelson|first=Andrew|publisher=Artsadmin|year=2012|isbn=0956562140|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing a series of essays on the work of the artist and written accounts as well as short talking heads films (on a CD accompanying the catalogue) of the personal and political journeys made by each of the Bambanani Group Members to counter discrimination experienced by people with AIDS/ HIV in South Africa. The catalogue for Unlimited Global Academy contains a foreword by author and Oxford University African Studies lecturer [[Jonny Steinberg]] who describes the project as the “product of a highly unusual consciousness.” Steinberg, citing Gadsden’s recognition of [http://www.memorybox.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12 Bambanani Group] Member, Nodumiso Hlwele’s motivation to create art as a way of managing chronic illness as a starting point for the collaboration. Steinberg goes on to say: “And not just unusual… but also important. For at a purely pragmatic level, those who make public works from this particular chronic illness, AIDS - be it in the form of art or advocacy or mass campaigns - are responsible for bringing these precious pills to countless people in the first place. Aside from producing powerful works for our contemplation, Gadsden, Hlwele and the rest of the Bambanani Group are also keeping a vital political matter alive.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unlimited Global Alchemy|last=Mitchelson|first=Andrew|last2=Steinberg|publisher=Artsadmin|year=2012|isbn=9780956562142|location=London|page=9|quote=Jonny Steinberg|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the Qatari Government's UK Year of Culture featured "This Breathing World", a major solo exhibition of 54 artworks &amp; films as part of the first ever Art &amp; Disability Festival in the Middle East at [[Katara Cultural Village]], Doha.&lt;ref name="DAI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsinternational.org/artists/profiles/rachel-gadsden/|title=Disability Arts International|publisher=British Council|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Gadsden was commissioned by the [[UK Parliament]] to create artwork as part of [http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/2015-parliament-in-the-making/get-involved1/2015-banners-exhibition/ ‘The Beginnings of that Freedome’] exhibition, which were gifted to organisations across the UK in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/visiting/visiting-parliament-news/parliament-gifts-original-commemorative-banners-to-organisations-across-the-uk/|title=UK Parliament|last=|first=|date=21 January 2016|website=UK Parliament|publisher=UK Parliament|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 18 Banners were commissioned by Parliament to celebrate 800 years since [[Magna Carta Libertatum|Magna Carta]] was sealed and the 750th Birthday of the Montfort Parliament, including 2 banners by Gadsden ‘1601 Poor Law’ and ‘1829 Catholic Emancipation Act’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/2015-parliament-in-the-making/get-involved1/2015-banners-exhibition/rachel-gadsden/|title=UK Parliament Westminster Hall banner exhibition|last=|first=|date=21 October 2016|website=UK Parliament|publisher=UK Parliament|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roberto Cavalli''' ({{IPA-it|roˈbɛrto kaˈvalli}}; born 15 November 1940) is an Italian fashion designer and inventor. He is known for exotic prints and for creating the sand-blasted look for [[jeans]]. The high-end Italian fashion house [[Roberto Cavalli (company)|Roberto Cavalli]] sells luxury clothing, [[perfume]] and [[leather]] accessories. Former [[Acne Studios]] creative consultant Paul Surridge succeeded Peter Dundas as [[creative director]] for the brand in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Gonzales,

==Biography==
Roberto Cavalli was born in [[Florence]], [[Tuscany]]. His grandfather, Giuseppe Rossi, was an artist and a member of the [[Macchiaioli]] Movement, whose work is exhibited in the [[Uffizi Gallery]].  Cavalli enrolled at the local Art Institute, concentrating in [[textile]] print. While still a student, he made a series of flower prints on knit that caught the attention of major Italian hosiery factories.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In the early 1970s, he invented and [[patent]]ed a printing procedure on [[leather]], and started creating patchworks of different materials. He debuted these techniques in Paris, immediately getting commissions from the likes of [[Hermès]] and [[Pierre Cardin]]. At age 32, he presented his first namesake collection at the Salon for Prêt-à-Porter in Paris. He brought it to the catwalks of the Sala Bianca of [[Palazzo Pitti]] in Florence, and later on those of Milano Collezioni, jeans made of printed denim, intarsia leathers, brocade, and wild prints. He then opened his first boutique in 1972 in Saint-Tropez.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In 1980, Roberto Cavalli married Eva Düringer, a former Miss Austria and first runner-up of the [[Miss Universe 1977]] pageant. In Milan in 1994, Cavalli presented the first sand-blasted jeans. By December of the same year, he had opened boutiques in [[Saint Barth]], in the French Caribbean, followed by others in [[Venice]] and [[Saint-Tropez]]. Besides the main line, which is sold in over fifty countries worldwide, Roberto Cavalli designs RC Menswear as well as the youth aimed [[diffusion line|line]] Just Cavalli, launched in 2000 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/roberto-cavalli-biography|author=Caroline Leaper|title=Roberto Cavalli|publisher=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=April 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comprising today men’s wear, women’s wear and accessories, eyewear, watches, jewelry, perfumes, underwear, and beachwear. There is also the Angels &amp; Devils Children Collection, the Class line, two underwear collections, shoes, eyewear, watches and perfumes. In 2002, Cavalli opened his first café-store in Florence, revamping it with his signature [[animal prints]]. This was shortly followed by the opening in Milan of the Just Cavalli café at Torre Branca and another boutique on [[Via della Spiga]].

Roberto Cavalli was a judge at the Miss Universe 1977 pageant where his future wife (Eva Duringer) was a contestant, who represented Austria and won second place. The woman that won was the first Black Miss Universe (Miss Trinidad and Tobago: Janelle Commissiong). In July 2011, his company collection was presented at the catwalk of [[The Brandery]] fashion show in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrandery.com/portal/appmanager/efiraSalones/S094011?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=P75201021481310034214819&amp;profileLocale=en |accessdate=July 14, 2011 |title=The Brandery Catwalk|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903012646/http://www.thebrandery.com/portal/appmanager/efiraSalones/S094011?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=P75201021481310034214819&amp;profileLocale=en |archivedate=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavalli has five children: Tommaso and Christiana from his first marriage, and Robert, Rachele, and Daniele from his second marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2004-A-Di/Cavalli-Roberto.html |title=Roberto Cavalli Biography - life, family, children, parents, name, wife, school, mother - Newsmakers Cumulation |publisher=Notablebiographies.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, 2013, he was awarded an Honorary Master Diploma in Fashion Management from [[Domus Academy]] in [[Milan]], during a ceremony after which he held a lectio magistralis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.domusacademy.com/site/home/news--events/on-going-news/roberto-cavalli.html |title=Tuesday, June 18Th &amp;#124; Roberto Cavalli At |publisher=Domus Academy |date=2015-09-22 |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many leading models have worked for the brand: [[Jessica Stam]], [[Eva Riccobono]], [[Laetitia Casta]], [[Natasha Poly]], [[Mariacarla Boscono]], [[Karen Elson]], [[Karolina Kurkova]] and Ivan Olita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singers designer, Armani as gettonato|url=http://www.corriere.it/spettacoli/speciali/2009/sanremo/notizie/sanremo_moda_bulbarelli_671a9136-fcd5-11dd-b299-00144f02aabc.shtml|publisher=Corriere della Sera|accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others. {{citation needed|reason=See talk page|date=December 2015}}.

==Brand==
As of January 2014, Cavalii returned to the role of men's creative director from his son, Daniele Cavalli, starting with the 2014 fall collection, appointing [[Martyn Bal]] as his righthand man&lt;ref name="Daniele Cavalli Exits Roberto Cavalli"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/design-change-7399470?src=nl/mornReport/20140129 | title=Daniele Cavalli Exits Roberto Cavalli | publisher=WWD | date=29 January 2014 | accessdate=29 January 2014 | author=Turra, Alessandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, on 24 January 2014, Gianluca Brozzetti (CEO) and Carlo Di Biagio (COO) announced they were leaving the fashion brand.&lt;ref name="Daniele Cavalli Exits Roberto Cavalli"/&gt;

In May 2014, Cavalli approached Investcorp, an investment firm in the [[Persian Gulf]], as a potential buyer of a stake in his fashion brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Roberto Cavalli approaches Investcorp for possible investment|work= Reuters|date=27 May 2014|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/27/us-cavalli-investcorp-idUSKBN0E70CJ20140527|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Cavalli was sharply criticized in 2004 by the [[Hindu]] community for marketing a line of feminine underwear (designed for [[Harrods]]) which featured the images of Hindu goddesses.   The line was eventually withdrawn and formal apologies were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3790315.stm|title=Harrods apology over Hindu bikinis|publisher=BBC.org.uk |date= 2004-06-09|accessdate=2004-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maktab Tarighat [[Uwaisi|Oveyssi]] Shahmaghsoudi school of [[Islamic]] [[Sufism]] accused Cavalli of copying their "sacred emblem" for branding the Just Cavalli line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designer Cavalli soll islamisches Symbol entweiht haben|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/leute/plagiat-roberto-cavalli-soll-islamisches-logo-entweiht-haben-a-968721.html|author=|language=German|trans-title=Designer Cavalli said to have desecrated Islamic symbol|publisher=Spiegel.de|accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sufi school brought forth a proceeding in Europe to the [[Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market]] (OHIM). "On 16 May 2014, the OHIM pronounced itself in the first degree rejecting the request made by the School to invalidate the Just Cavalli logo.  The Court states that the two logos are not mistakable and do not present any similarities."&lt;ref name="Swash"&gt;{{cite web|last=Swash|first=Rosie|title=Sufi students protest at Roberto Cavalli perfume logo's similarity to sacred symbol|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/may/29/roberto-cavalli-perfume-offends-sufi-students|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, students of the Sufi school have continued their protest.&lt;ref name="Swash"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cavalli Store At NorthPark Center Draws Protest|url=http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2014/05/23/cavalli-store-at-northpark-center-draws-protest/|publisher=Dfw.cbslocal.com|accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protest Held In Beverly Hills Over Designer’s Use Of Islamic Symbol|url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/05/31/protest-held-in-beverly-hills-over-designers-use-of-islamic-symbol/#.U4uzNwb_w7I.twitter|publisher=Losangelese.cbslocal.com|accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnallnews.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/ice-on-great-lakes-till-june.html?m=1#3 |title=CNN News: Ice on the Great Lakes till June? |publisher=Cnnallnews.blogspot.co.uk |date=2014-06-01 |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Roberto Cavalli Stealing Ideas Consistently?|url=http://www.glammonitor.com/2014/09/13/roberto-cavalli-stealing-ideas/|publisher=GlamMonitor.com|accessdate=2015-09-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610011739/http://www.glammonitor.com/2014/09/13/roberto-cavalli-stealing-ideas/|archivedate=2015-06-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Romanesque architecture''' is an architectural style of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Europe characterised by semi-circular [[arch]]es. The term "Romanesque" is usually used for the period from the 10th to the 12th century with  "[[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]]" and "[[First Romanesque]]" being applied to earlier buildings with Romanesque characteristics. [[Romanesque architecture]] can be found across the continent, diversified by regional materials and characteristics, but with an overall consistency that makes it the first pan-European architectural style since [[Roman architecture|Imperial Roman Architecture]]. The Romanesque style in England is traditionally referred to as [[Norman architecture]].

The commonest surviving Romanesque buildings are churches, of which many are still standing, more or less intact and frequently in use.&lt;ref name=BF&gt;Bannister Fletcher, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method’’.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these churches were built as abbeys, to serve religious communities. The living quarters and other monastic buildings of these abbeys constitute a significant part of the remaining domestic architecture of the Romanesque period.

The second most common type of surviving Romanesque building is the [[castle]], of which the great majority are in ruins, as a result of war, or the practice of dismantling castles that might later be used in uprisings. A number of ruined or much altered imperial palaces, some of them within castle walls, others unfortified, have also survived in [[Germany]] and [[Alsace]].

Examples of purely domestic architecture include the [[great hall]] of a fortified manor in England, and a small number of large town houses in France and Germany and several palazzos in Venice. A great many more small houses are spread across Europe, often greatly altered by the insertion of later windows, and sometimes with their antiquity unrecognised and unrecorded.

==History==
{{Further|Romanesque architecture}}
The following is a summary of essential points from the section '''[[Romanesque architecture#History|History]]''' in the article cited above.

===Origins===
Romanesque architecture was the first distinctive style to spread across Europe since the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=HG&gt;Helen Gardner, ''Art through the Ages’’.&lt;/ref&gt;  Architecture of a Romanesque style developed simultaneously in the north of Italy, parts of France and in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the 10th century.

===Politics and religion===
The Romanesque period was a time of frequent conflict. Much of Europe was affected by [[feudalism]] in which peasants held tenure from local rulers over the land that they farmed in exchange for [[military service]] and employment on building projects. This resulted in the building of castles at strategic points, many of them being constructed as strongholds of the Normans, descendants of the Vikings who invaded northern France in 911. The invasion of England by [[William, Duke of Normandy]], in 1066, saw the building of both castles and abbeys which reinforced the Norman presence. Political struggles also resulted in the fortification of many towns, or the rebuilding and strengthening of walls that remained from the Roman period. One of the most notable surviving fortifications is that of the city of [[Carcassonne]]. The enclosure of towns brought about a lack of living space within the walls, and resulted in a style of town house that was tall and narrow, often surrounding communal courtyards, as at [[San Gimignano]] in [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref name = Toman1&gt;Rolf Toman, pp. 114-117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copplestone, pp.188-89&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s built a number of residences both castles and palaces, at strategic points and on trade routes. The Imperial Palace of [[Goslar]] (heavily restored in the 19th century) was built in the early 11th century by Otto III and Henry III, while the ruined Palace at [[Gelnhausen]] was received by Frederick Barbarossa prior to 1170.&lt;ref name = Toman2&gt;Rolf Toman, pp. 70-73&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of people and armies also brought about the building of bridges, some of which have survived, including the 12th-century bridge at [[Besalú]], [[Catalonia]], the 11th-century [[Puente La Reina - Gares|Puente de la Reina]], [[Navarre]] and the Pont-Saint-Bénézet, [[Avignon]].&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Toman, pp. 18, 177, 188&lt;/ref&gt;

The system of monasticism in which the religious become members of an order, with common ties and a common rule, living in a mutually dependent community, rather than as a group of hermits living in proximity but essentially separate, was established by the monk [[Benedict of Nursia|Benedict]] in the 6th century. From this time onwards, monasteries were established across Europe, bringing about not only the construction of large churches, but also [[cloisters]], domestic quarters and other buildings associated with community living such as hospitals, barns, and forges.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, pp. 130-148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banister Fletcher, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Crusades]], 1095–1270, which were intended to wrest the Holy Places of Palestine from [[Islam]]ic control, resulted in the building of castles in Syria and Palestine. The Crusades brought about a very large movement of people and, with them, ideas and trade skills, particularly those involved in the building of fortifications and the metal working needed for the provision of arms, which was also applied to the fitting and decoration of buildings. The continual movement of people, rulers, nobles, bishops, abbots, craftsmen and peasants, was an important factor in creating a homogeneity in building methods and a recognizable ''Romanesque style'', despite regional differences.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Characteristics==
{{Further|Romanesque architecture}}

===Walls and Materials===
Most domestic buildings of the Romanesque period were built of wood, or partly of wood. In Scandinavian countries, buildings were often entirely of wood, while in other parts of Europe, buildings were "half-timbered", constructed with timber frames, the spaces filled with rubble, wattle and daub, or other materials which were then plastered over.&lt;ref name=MFW263&gt;Moffett, Fazio, Wodehouse, pp. 263-264&lt;/ref&gt; Stone was often used for basements. The building material differs greatly across Europe, depending upon the local stone and building traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Banister Fletcher, p. 303-04&lt;/ref&gt;

While in most countries stone is the usual material for substantial buildings such as castles and palaces, in much of Poland, Germany, northern Italy and the Netherlands, brick is more commonly used. Where stone has been used for domestic buildings, it is often in comparatively small and irregular pieces, bedded in thick mortar. Smooth [[ashlar]] masonry was used where easily worked limestone was available.&lt;ref&gt;Rene Hyughe, p.263&lt;/ref&gt; For defensive buildings such as castles, the walls are massively thick. In all Romanesque architecture, the windows tend to be small. The general impression of Romanesque architecture is of solidity and strength.&lt;ref name = BF/&gt;

File:Münzenberg Fenster.jpg|Münzenberg Palace has walls of rubble but refined detailing in its windows, the triple arch of the door and the gallery seen beyond which opens onto a vista.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Arches, arcades, piers and columns===
Arches in domestic architecture across Europe during this period are always semi-circular, with the only exceptions occurring in palatial buildings in [[Sicily]] where [[Norman architecture]] was influenced by the [[Islamic architecture|Islamic style]]. Arcades (rows of arches) occur in the interior of large buildings such as the great hall of a castle, supporting the timbers of a roof or upper floor. Arcades are also used to create cloisters and loggias. Arcading on a large scale generally fulfils a structural purpose, but it is also used on a smaller scale, as a decorative feature, both internally and externally.

In Romanesque domestic architecture, arcades were most often supported on [[Pier (architecture)|pier]]s. They were built of masonry and are of square or rectangular section, generally having a horizontal moulding representing a capital at the springing of the arch.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=HG/&gt; Columns were also used to support arcades and vaults, but are a feature of palace, civic and monastic architecture, rather than smaller houses. Colonnettes and attached shafts are also used structurally and for decoration.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt; The capital on top of a column is usually cut so that it is round at the bottom, where it sits on the column, and square at the top where it support the arch. A capital might be undecorated, or else have foliate or figurative carving.

File:Palazzo della ragione di Padova 11.jpg|The [[groin vault]] of the upper arcade at the [[Palazzo della Ragione, Padua]].
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Vaults and roofs===
Timber was used extensively in building. The majority of buildings have open wooden roofs.&lt;ref name=MFW263/&gt; When building have stone undercrofts, or basements, this lower floor may be vaulted, with a [[barrel vault|barrel]] or [[groin vault]]. Vaulted domestic spaces are particularly found in monastic buildings, castles and palaces where skilled master masons were employed. Towards the end of the period, vaulted spaces in monastic buildings employed the [[ribbed vault]], as it was used in abbey churches.

===Doors and windows===
Narrow doors and small windows are often square topped, being bridged by a solid stone lintel which may be supported on projecting brackets. Some stone buildings have retained wooden lintels. Larger doorways and windows are topped with semi-circular arches, as are arcades and vaults. Large doorways in more elaborate dwellings are often set within three [[archivolt]]s or mouldings and may also have corbels or colonnettes and capitals, as at the Jew's house at Lincoln. Square-topped windows are often set in groups, with two or three beneath a single lintel. Round-topped windows are often paired under a wide arch, and separated by stone [[mullion]]s or colonnettes.
In Sicily there are a number of palaces and churches where the pointed arch is used during this period, apparently adopted from [[Islamic architecture]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Architectural embellishment and sculpture===
Stone buildings are often ornamented with projecting courses which may be flat fillets or rounded mouldings. These are sometimes carved with patterns, particularly [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]s. An arched doorway that is set into a thick wall may be deeply recessed, and have three or more bands of moulding around it. Doorways sometimes have colonnettes with small capitals, as are also found on the transoms that divide paired windows. Sometimes capitals and corbels are carved with floral motifs or figures.

Arcading is a significant decorative feature of Romanesque architecture, occurring most often in domestic architecture as a [[Lombard band]] which is a row of small arches that appear to support a roofline.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Colour===
Colour was used in a variety of ways to enhance buildings during this period. Rendered walls could be coloured, with different fashions prevailing in different regions. Stone buildings sometimes had external details picked out in colour. In Italy buildings were often constructed with alternating bands of brick and stone. In Venice, the palaces of wealthy families had veneers of marble which contrasted with the painted stucco.
Internally, the large wall surfaces and plain, curving vaults of the Romanesque period lent themselves to mural decoration and traces of them have been found in castles and wealthy homes.&lt;ref&gt;Banister Fletcher, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vast majority of these paintings, like the buildings themselves have been destroyed by rebuilding and redecoration, damp, war, neglect and changing fashion. The few exceptions of secular decoration have mostly survived because they were in the care of the church. Very rare survivals of high quality are the [[paintings from Arlanza]] in Spain, which are now dispersed to museums in [[Barcelona]] and America. These [[frescos]] of about 1210 come from a monastery, but have secular subject matter, and presumably are similar to those that existed in some palaces. There are a number of huge real and mythical animals reflecting the world of [[heraldry]] and illuminated [[bestiaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 268&lt;/ref&gt;

Tapestries and other textile hangings were also used to decorate palaces, with the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] much the best known example - though now in [[Bayeux Cathedral]] it was very probably originally made to decorate [[Odo, Earl of Kent|Bishop Odo's]] palace hall in the 1070s, and other such hangings are recorded. The narrative tale of a heroic victory in war was another theme no doubt often repeated. The 11th-century [[Cloth of St Gereon]] may always have been in a church, but its adoption of designs from figured Eastern textiles was also probably a style used in grand homes. Textile hangings helped to keep draughty stone buildings warm, and had the great advantage for those with many homes of being relatively easy to carry between them.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 11-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monastic buildings==
Within the Catholic tradition, communal [[monasticism]] was established by [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]] at [[Monte Cassino]] around 529. It was encouraged by [[Charlemagne]] with an increasing number of monasteries being founded across Europe in the late Middle Ages. The most influential orders during that period were the [[Benedictines]], the [[Cluniacs]] founded at Cluny in 910, and then the [[Cistercians]] founded in 1098. [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] entered the Cistercian Order in 1113 and, as its leader, founded more than five hundred monasteries of austere design and often in remote locations.&lt;ref name = Toman68&gt;Toman, pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carolingian [[Plan of Saint Gall]] dating from the early 9th century is a detailed draught of an abbey church and its accompanying monastic buildings, the oldest such architectural plan to exist since Roman times. It shows an idealised arrangement with individual cells for monks, workshops, amenities, gardens, stables and a school. It constitutes a living space for a completely self-sufficient community.&lt;ref name = Toman34&gt;Toman pp. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt; Natural constraints such as the building site, the close proximity of town buildings, and lack of funds meant that in practice few monasteries were so lavishly constructed during the Romanesque period. From the 10th century, the great [[Cluny|Abbey of Cluny]] set a standard of building and amenities that was to be emulated by others.

The surviving domestic and utility buildings of monastic complexes are in general set apart from the surviving dwellings of the common laity by the quality of both structure and detail. Although built for the communal living of lives vowed to poverty and simplicity, monastic buildings are in general solidly constructed and finely finished with vaulted ceilings, mouldings, columns and carvings that are directly related to the forms found in monastic churches, while the cloisters that formed the nucleus of monastic life are frequently masterpieces of Romanesque construction, style and ornament.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Types of buildings===
In general, the main living and working quarters of any monastery were the [[cloister]]s, four arcaded passages that surrounded a courtyard and were located, wherever possible, adjacent to and on the southern (sunniest) side of the church.&lt;ref name = Cross67/&gt; The arcades at ground level were the monk's working and general living space, containing carrels for study and writing, and often along one range, a "lavatorium" where the monks could wash their hands and faces before eating. Above the arcades ran long dormitories where the monks slept. Where such buildings still exist from the Romanesque period, they are built of stone, although at the majority of early monasteries, they were probably of wooden construction. Monastic buildings generally became increasingly comfortable and more robust over time, with stone replacing wood, open arcades being glazed against the wind and open dormitories being fitted with wooden screens for warmth and privacy.&lt;ref name= Cross67&gt;Crossley, pp. 67-71&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of buildings surrounded and abutted the cloister. The chapter house was the most significant, as the meeting place of the governing body of the abbey. It generally projected from the eastern side of the cloister, and might have near it a narrow passage or "slype" that led to a burial ground near the eastern end of the church.&lt;ref name = Cross67/&gt;

Also off the cloister arcade was a [[calefactory]] or  "warming room" where a fire burnt during the winter. It was generally located under part of the dormitory. A staircase often descended from the dormitory directly into a transept of the church, and was used by the monks at night. Projecting from the dormitory was the "necessarium" or toilet block, with a drain running beneath the toilets.&lt;ref name= Cross67/&gt;  An important building of which a number of examples have survived was the [[refectory]] or dining hall. Adjacent to the refectory were the monastic kitchens, with their proximity to the cloister being determined by whether the cooking was done by the brethren of the monastery or by lay employees.&lt;ref name = Cross71&gt;Crossley, pp. 71-75&lt;/ref&gt;

Set apart from the cloister was the [[Hospital|infirmary]] for the treatment of the sick, and where elderly frail members of the monastic community could be cared for. This was generally a large hall but might constitute a whole separate complex with its own chapel, kitchen and courtyard. A separate dining chamber known as the "misericord" was often attached to the infirmary, so that sick and infirm aged brothers could benefit by eating red meat, something not permitted in the refectory.&lt;ref name=Cross71/&gt;

Early in the establishment of monasteries, it was expected that the abbot or prior would live in the dormitory, in communion with the other monks. As the role of abbot became increasingly that of a business manager and entrepreneur, this humble living style was abandoned, and separate houses were built, outside the cloister.&lt;ref name = Cross71/&gt; Other buildings commonly occurring within monastic precinct include bakehouses, breweries, granaries, well houses, forges, barns and dovecotes.&lt;ref name = Cross76&gt;Crossley, pp. 76-77&lt;/ref&gt; Guest houses were often built for travellers, and alms houses for the care of the poor. Schools were also found in association with monasteries. Many monasteries had a gatehouse where a member of the laity lived and guarded the monastic precinct.&lt;ref name =Cross76/&gt;

===Examples===
Monastic complexes often developed over several centuries, with buildings of different dates abutting each other, and individual buildings being enlarged and altered in later architectural periods. Apart from churches (which are dealt with in a separate article), large Romanesque buildings are rare, even within the context of ancient monasteries. However, a number of fine examples exist, scattered across Europe, with [[Sénanque Abbey]], consecrated in 1178, being a rare survival that has retained many of its original Romanesque buildings intact, including the church, cloister, dormitory, calefactory and chapter house. The monastery of St [[Martin-du-Canigou]], founded 1005, has also retained its original form and some of its original domestic buildings, although damaged, both by earthquake and over-zealous restoration.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Reid, p 110&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Maulbronn]] in Germany the medieval monastery has remained virtually intact, but typically the buildings vary in date, with the earliest being Romanesque of the late 12th century.&lt;ref name = Toman68/&gt;  The [[Abbey of Fontenay]] has retained a number of important buildings including the monks' dormitory, the monks' hall, the [[scriptorium]] and a large [[forge]].

At [[Lorsch]] in Germany and at [[Bury St Edmunds]] in England remain two impressive gatehouses of very different styles. The Lorsch Abbey gatehouse led into a complex the form of which can now only be determined by archaeology. The gatehouse itself dates from 774 and combines a number of features from Classical Antiquity such as [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns and the [[triumphal arch]] motif with Northern European vernacular in the triangulation of the "arches" of the upper story and the steeply pitched roof, and Byzantine ornament in the polychrome surface decoration.&lt;ref name = Toman34/&gt; The Norman Tower at Bury St Edmunds was built by Abbott Anselm in the second quarter of the 11th century as the main entrance to the monastery from the town.&lt;ref&gt;Bury St Edmunds Past and Present Society, ''[http://www.burypastandpresent.org.uk/jarman-captions/abbey/churchyard.shtml The Norman Tower]'', (accessed: 2011-08-10)&lt;/ref&gt; It rises in four stages of different heights, with a single arched portal and groups of three openings of varied design on the upper levels, between flattened corner buttresses.

Romanesque cloisters remain at many ancient monasteries, particularly in France, Spain and Italy. They vary from simple structures with wooden trussed roofs or groin vaults and arcades supported on stout piers as at [[St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim|St Milchael's]], Hildesheim, to elegant ribbed-vaults and arcades filled with plate tracery like those at the [[Tarragona Cathedral|Cathedral of Tarragona]], Spain, and supported on highly decorated paired columns with figurative capitals like those at [[Moissac Abbey|St Pierre]], Moissac, France and [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran#Lateran cloister|St John Laterano]], Rome. The cloisters sometimes retain an upper arcade which gave access to dormitories or cells, as at the Cathedral St. Léonce and the monastery of [[Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos|Santo Domingo de Silos]] in [[Burgos]].

Of the various chambers that abutted the cloisters, those on the ground floor often had groin or ribbed vaults like those found in the scriptorium at Fontenay. Where large buildings such as the forge at Fontenay have survived, they take the form of barn-like halls with flattened buttresses and small round-headed windows.

Cloisters often contained a well. At Unser Lieben Frauen in Magdeburg, Germany, there is an elaborate well-house in the cloister, while a ruined example exists at Mellifont Abbey.

==Fortified buildings==
{{Main|Castle}}
The castle represents, overwhelmingly, the type of domestic architecture for which there is the greatest number of surviving examples in the Romanesque style. There also exist a range of domestic buildings associated with monastic precincts, palaces, civic buildings and town houses.

===Keeps===
[[Castle]]s developed from wooden [[palisade]]s, built for defense, or from [[motte]]s where an earth mound, usually artificial, was surmounted by a tall wooden structure and often surrounded by ditches. This latter system of defense was further developed with the addition of outer palisades enclosing a [[bailey (fortification)|bailey]] in which domestic buildings were constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Banister Fletcher, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;  From about 1000 onwards the wooden building on the motte was replaced with a ''donjon'' (stone [[keep]]), the earliest of which is believed to have been at [[Doue-la-Fontaine]], [[Maine-et-Loire]], France, built in about 950.&lt;ref name = Toman3&gt;Rolf Toman, pp. 499-451&lt;/ref&gt;

Judging from the size of the openings to be found in the lower stories, the earliest tall stone buildings appear to have served chiefly as residences. However, with necessity, they developed an increasing number of defensive features.
Many such castles were to be erected by the Norman invaders of England. Although a number of 12th-century keeps such as those of [[Houdan]] and [[Provins]] castles in France were circular or polygonal in plan, square keeps predominated in England. Examples of square keeps include the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]] (the [[Tower of London]]), [[Castle Hedingham]] in Essex and [[Rochester Castle]] in Kent.&lt;ref&gt;Toman, p.174&lt;/ref&gt; After 1150, there were a greater number of polygonal keeps, which were harder to mine. Examples include those at [[Windsor Castle]], [[Conisborough Castle|Conisborough]]  and [[Orford Castle|Orford]] castles.&lt;ref name = BF438&gt;Banister Fletcher, p.438&lt;/ref&gt;

These castles of rectangular plan are ''hall-keeps'', with their primary purpose being as the dwelling of a ruler, the hall being the main living chamber, generally on the first floor.&lt;ref name = BF438/&gt; In some such keeps the basement level has columns supporting a vault. The floors above this are of wood, supported on long timber beams of which plenty could be cut from the forests at that date. Within a large keep like that at Rochester, the main spaces could be divided by a stone wall or tier of arcades rising through several storeys. Many castles had projecting turrets at the corners which contained spiral staircases, while the thick walls of the upper storeys contained passages. Rochester has retained a fireplace set into a wall within a decorated arch. Upper floors of Romanesque keeps sometimes have differentiated windows marking the private rooms of the lord and lady. There may also be a chapel; for example, located in the White Tower of the Tower of London is the [[St John's Chapel, London|St John's Chapel]], set in a corner turret.

In mountainous regions, castles often take highly irregular forms, adapting the plan to the site in varied ways. Castles have often developed over the centuries and typically have had additional encircling walls added. Between 1072 and 1080, [[Sancho III of Navarre]] (the Great) built [[Loarre Castle]] on a high rocky ridge in the foothills of the Pyrenees, as a commitment to the [[Reconquista]]. The castle was further fortified in the 13th century by an outer wall with ten towers. Although outwardly of austere appearance, Castle Loarre has living quarters of comparative comfort, and a chapel ornamented with fine carvings.&lt;ref&gt;Toman, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Walled castles and palaces===

Other castles begun in the 11th century were built on elevated sites that took advantage of the steep slopes for defense, rather than on moats. The central tower became the final defensive layer of the castle,&lt;ref&gt;Copplestone&lt;/ref&gt; while the main domestic quarters were built against the walls around the perimeter, allowing plenty of room for a variety of functions. [[Conisborough Castle]] is an English example, with the [[shell keep]] rising on the earlier motte, and a wall with the residential and service quarters built into it, enclosing the bailey. The ruins within the bailey show remains of a [[great hall]] with central fireplace, a kitchen and a two storeyed residential block with adjacent latrines. The keep itself contains a room for the lord, complete with a hooded fireplace, while a small vaulted chapel was built into the thick outer wall of the keep.&lt;ref name = Toman2/&gt; [[Ludlow Castle]], [[Shropshire]] begun in the 11th century, was lived in by a number of members of the Tudor royal family and had both its fortifications and living quarters improved over several centuries.

The [[Hohenstaufen]] Castle St Ulrich at [[Ribeauville]], [[Alsace]], and Castle Trifel at [[Annweiler]] are examples of this type of castles with comfortable living quarters.&lt;ref name = Toman2/&gt; [[Münzenberg Castle]]  is remarkable in having two tall keeps. It has a two encircling walls, with an ornate palace built into the wall of the upper ward, with galleries of mullioned windows looking out over the valley.

Other less fortified dwellings, such as the Palaces of [[Düsseldorf-Kaiserswerth|Kaiserwerth]], [[Gelnhausen]], [[Landsberg, Saxony-Anhalt|Landsberg]] and [[Goslar]], were constructed on more accessible sites, and were in regular use by the imperial court or officials. They have large halls, atriums, colonnaded balconies and courtyards surrounded by arcades, similar to monastic cloisters. These complexes, where they have survived without the over-zealous Romantic restoration of the 19th century seen at Goslar, are buildings of great architectural refinement.&lt;ref name = Toman2/&gt;

Many town walls, monastic precincts and palaces had gatehouses built with a guardroom or living quarters above a large archway. One of the earliest is the gateway of Lorsch Abbey, the lower part of which has three openings like a Roman triumphal arch, while the upper part, of polychrome brick, has detailing resembling half-timbered house, the effect enhanced by the large steeply pitched slate roof.&lt;ref&gt;Toman, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast the gatehouse of the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds resembles a church tower. Many Romanesque gates are set into the walls of Italian cities. These are invariably of fine masonry and battlemented but otherwise without ornamentation.

==Domestic buildings==

===Characteristics===
Few houses of the Romanesque period have survived across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Banister Fletcher, p 347&lt;/ref&gt; One reason is that many of them were built of wooden or half timbered construction. A number of half timbered houses in Germany at Esslingen, Bad Wimpfen and Swabisch Hall have been shown to date from this period.&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Toman, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;  The houses that are still standing are mostly of stone, like the house at [[Bad Munstereifel]] in Germany, the houses in [[Lincolnshire]], England, and the houses of the village of Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert, [[Languedoc-Roussillon]], France.

One of the simplest types of Romanesque house was the "long house". These were typically built of wood and thatch, were of a single story and housed both the family and the livestock. The long house had doors in either side, making a passage dividing the living quarters of the family from that of the animals. The living room had a central hearth, with smoke holes in the gable. There is an extant stone long house of this plan at [[Bad Kösen]], Germany&lt;ref name=MFW263/&gt;

File:Oakham Castle Horseshoes.jpg|The interior of Oakham Castle.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

A substantial stone-built Romanesque house, like the Romanesque castle keep, usually had the main living space on the first floor, elevated above an undercroft. This undercroft might take two forms, either an enclosed cellar-like basement, or an open loggia. It might serve for storage, as a stable or for commercial purposes, depending on the location and owners of the house. This arrangement is apparent at the Manor House at [[Boothby Pagnell]], and St Mary's Guild, both in Lincolnshire, England.&lt;ref&gt;Banister Fletcher, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt;

The living space on the first floor was, in the simpler houses, a single room, with access by an external staircase of stone or wood. Early houses might have an open stone hearth and a smoke hole in the roof. The interiors of houses developed with separate chambers and partitions of stone or wood. Additional rooms might be accessed from an external wooden gallery, cantilevered from holes and corbels along the walls, as seen the 13th-century house at [[Poreč]], [[Croatia]].

Doorways might have a stone or wooden lintel, but were often arched, and in finer houses had mouldings, decorative carvings and perhaps colonnettes and carved capitals around the doors. A common form of doorway in Italy had shaped corbels projecting inward to support a stone transom, above which rose an open arch. This form continued into the Gothic period and evolved into the [[fanlight]]  The simplest window were narrow and round-topped. Windows into important rooms were often paired arched openings, divided by a colonnette or [[mullion]]. Some houses have paired mullioned windows set under lintels rather than arches, while in France there are a number of houses which have rows of square topped windows divided by mullions and piers, set within the framework of a horizontal course, and forming a gallery.

===City houses and tower houses===
Houses built within medieval cities were restricted in space, often by the fact that the town was encircled by walls. As a response to this, houses in cities were usually multi-storeyed. The simplest of these buildings were extremely cramped for space, having just a single room on each floor, accessible only by steep ladder-like stairs. In some cases exterior staircases gave onto wooden balconies which served the upper floors of a whole row of tall narrow houses, as is evidenced by the rows of holes and supporting corbels that are found in the walls of a great many Italian medieval buildings. Likewise, small inner courts which provided light and air were communal spaces for surrounding buildings.&lt;ref name = Toman1/&gt; They also provided for the collection of rainwater. Narrow multi-storeyed houses of the Romanesque period have survived in a number of cities, with the greatest number occurring in Italy, where they are generally built of stone or brick and have often been extended at later dates, or had their Romanesque openings altered, making them indistinguishable from later medieval buildings. Casa Dante, thought to have been the home of [[Dante Alighieri]], in Florence, is a good surviving example. In Germany the Baumburg Tower in [[Regensburg]] is an elegant late 13th-century example showing elements that are transitional between Romanesque and Gothic in its decorative window openings which are different on each floor, and contrast with the smoothly stuccoed walls. Another house, at Karden, has similar features but in form combines a tower house and a hall. The extremes of tall city housing are found in [[San Gimignano]] and [[Bologna]] where families rivaled each other in the construction of very tall tower houses. In Bologna only the Torre Garisenda, (1100), 130&amp;nbsp;ft and the Torre Asinelli, (1109), 225&amp;nbsp;ft, have survived, but the much smaller walled hill-town of San Gimignano contains fourteen tower and the stumps of very many more, having once bristled with them.&lt;ref&gt;Banister Fletcher, p.323&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the tall houses of this city served the practical purpose of suspending bolts of cloth for drying, in the shade rather than in the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Moffett, Fazio and Wodehouse, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Town houses===
In France there are a number of locations at which clusters of Romanesque houses have survived. A group exists in the village of Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert, near the ancient monastery. There are a significant number in [[Cluny]], including plastered timber-framed examples. The finest Romanesque town-house is at St-Antonin-Noble-Val, [[Tarn-et-Garonne]], France, built by the Granolhet family in the early 12th century. This substantial house of three storeys has a broad street front, braced on one side by projecting bell tower with typical paired mullioned windows. The ground floor is an open loggia, with an arcade on piers. Across the first floor is a long window or recessed gallery with delicate colonnettes all framed between two continuous horizontal mouldings. On the upper floor is a row of three mullioned windows.&lt;ref&gt;Toman, p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, a significant building of this time is the 12th- or 13th-century Rector's Palace in San Gimignano. This modestly sized building, fronting onto a square, has a symmetrical façade, a low gable that retains the appearance of a Classical pediment, and a portal that has a semi-circular arch raised above a broad lintel supported on corbels, a common feature of medieval Italian domestic architecture and also seen at the House of Dante.&lt;ref&gt;Rosella Vantaggi, ''San Gimignano, Town of the Fine Towers'', Plurigraf, (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; This house has a doorway, also with arch and lintel, between the two mullioned windows of its upper floor that once led out onto a balcony, like the one that has been restored on a 13th-century house at [[Poreč]] in Istria, [[Croatia]].

The house at Poreč typifies the nature of the few stone houses remaining of this period in that the main living quarters were on the first floor, elevated above a basement or "undercroft", and accessed by an external stone staircase. The house at Poreč has another feature also seen in England, an external chimney breast projects from the upper storey directly above a doorway.

On the aptly named Steep Street that leads up to Lincoln Cathedral (once a great Norman church but almost entirely rebuilt in the Gothic style) are two merchant's houses which are known as “the Jew’s House” and “Aaron the Jew’s House”, (c. 1170). Both houses have been much altered and have been fitted with sash windows and shop fronts, but both retain their doorways and both originally had a fireplace to an upper room directly above it, with arches supporting the chimney and framing the door. The details of the mouldings of the arches over the doors and upper windows are of fine craftsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage, ''[http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=326685 Aaron the Jew's House]'', National Monuments Record. (accessed: 07-07-2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage, ''[http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=326716 The Jew's House]'', National Monuments Record. (accessed: 07-07-2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy a complex of medieval buildings has been restored at the [[Monselice|Castle of Monselice]] (Castello Cini) which includes houses from the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries. The oldest, known as Casa Romanica has two large arches making a loggia at the ground floor, above which rises a plain facade broken only by small windows and a jutting chimney breast. The loggia leads into a large kitchen with rough-hewn wooden columns standing on stone bases and spreading the weight of the wide beams of the upper floor on projecting horizontal brackets. The upper floor has a "great hall" and a smaller room over the loggia with a groin vault. The 12th-century "Castelletto" and 13th-century Ezzolino's Tower have both retained Romanesque characteristics, with the later being built of brick and having more ornate features such as paired mullioned windows on its upper floor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castellodimonselice.it/en-US/castle-of-monselice Castle of Monselice], (accessed: 2011-07-14)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merchant palaces and commercial buildings==

Merchant palaces are essentially city buildings, of initially modest scale but growing in size by the 13th century, where wealthy trading families both lived and carried out their businesses. In Venice a number of these buildings remain, with their open basement loggias stretching along the main waterway, the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]], and the principal rooms of the [[piano nobile]] opening onto an arcaded balcony overlooking the view. The round-headed arches are often stilted,&lt;ref&gt;Banister Fletcher, p 324&lt;/ref&gt; and the openings on the upper floors are grouped in patterns with those to the sides being differentiated from the grouping at the centre. The details are handled with a lightness and delicacy that typifies Venetian medieval architecture. While the structures are brick, the favoured material for architectural decoration was marble, which is elaborately carved into intricate details, or laid on the surface as patterened veneers. Like [[St Mark's Basilica]], the architecture of the houses shows a [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] influence. They include the [[Ca' Farsetti]], [[Ca' da Mosto]], [[Ca' Loredan]], and the [[Fondaco dei Turchi]].

[[Fondaco dei Turchi]]  was built as a private palace for the wealthy Pesaro family and, like the other palazzi along the Grand Canal, was designed to facilitate business, with its long arcade stretching along the main waterway. It was one of the most imposing buildings in Venice during the late Medieval period, and was used by the Senate to accommodate visiting dignitaries. It was later leased to Turkish traders, hence its name.&lt;ref&gt;Kaminski, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Although heavily restored during the 19th century, the building demonstrates typical features of Venetian Romanesque: the stilted, round-topped arches of the arcade, the pavilions at each end of the building, the upper gallery, the crenellations and [[patera]], marble roundels or foliate ornaments applied to the exterior walls.&lt;ref&gt;Kaminski, p.564&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern European version of the merchant house can be seen at the Overstolzenhaus, in Cologne, with six stories of windows and crow-stepped gables. While the open loggias of houses were used for trade and those of town halls were widely used for markets, (see below) other commercial buildings were purpose-built, sometimes by city authorities, to facilitate trade, with an important example of an extant commercial building being the ''{{lang|nl|Korenstapelhuis}}'' ({{lang-en|Old Corn Warehouse}}) in Ghent, Belgium, which is close by the quay and has a wide front with two rows of openings to facilitate the handling and stacking of bags of grain.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Civic buildings==
In Italy a number of important Romanesque civic buildings have remained largely intact and have continued in use. It is characteristic of Italian Medieval architecture that there is no clear break between the Romanesque and Gothic styles. Groin vaults, rounded arches, paired windows, horizontal courses and other such features continued in use from the 11th century to the early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Banister Fletcher, pp. 598-633&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, in secular architecture, only the shape of the heads of windows indicate a late 13th- or 14th-century date rather than 12th or early 13th century. Many of Italy's finest Romanesque buildings, such as the Palazzo della Ragione, [[Mantua]] (begun 1250), were constructed many years after the Gothic style was already well established.

The open ground-floor loggia that is found in some Romanesque town houses also occurs in Italy at a number of buildings that served civic or communal purposes. In the cities of Mantua, [[Milan]] and [[Padua]] the [[Palazzo della Ragione]] (“place of reason”) and in Como the Broletto served as a town hall and centre of local government. These buildings spread their vast facades across large city squares which contrasted with the cramped medieval living quarters of most townsfolk. The loggia provided a covered communal space, and at Padua has been extended to form the city's major market. The Palazzo in Milan, also known as the Broletto Nuovo, (“New Court House”) is a red brick structure with stone piers and rendered upper floor. It window arches are polychrome in the Italian style.&lt;ref name =Toman1/&gt; The Broletto in Como is faced with polychrome marble.

The Tuscan hill town of [[Massa Marittima]] has two Romanesque civic buildings which typify the character of medieval architecture of Tuscany as against that found in the north. The Palazzo del Podestà and Palazzo del Comune of Massa Marittima represent a type of Romanesque civic building that continued in the Gothic style in other hill towns such as [[Volterra]] and reached its grandest expression in late the 13th-century [[Bargello]] and early 14th-century [[Palazzo Vecchio]] of Florence, and the [[Palazzo Pubblico]] of Siena.

==Romanesque revival==
{{Main|Romanesque Revival architecture}}
During the 19th century, when [[Gothic Revival architecture]] was fashionable, buildings were occasionally designed in the Romanesque style. There are a number of Romanesque Revival churches, dating from as early as the 1830s and continuing into the 20th century where the massive and "brutal" quality of the Romanesque style was appreciated and designed in brick.
The [[Natural History Museum, London]] designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], 1879, on the other hand, is a Romanesque revival building which makes full use of the decorative potential of Romanesque arcading and architectural sculpture. The Romanesque appearance has been achieved while freely adapting an overall style to suit the function of the building. The columns of the foyer, for example, give an impression of incised geometric design similar to those of Durham Cathedral. However, the sources of the incised patterns are the trunks of palms, cycads and tropical tree ferns. The animal motifs, of which there are many, include rare and exotic species.

The type of modern buildings for which the Romanesque style was most frequently adapted was the warehouse, where a lack of large windows and an appearance of great strength and stability were desirable features. These buildings, generally of brick, frequently have flattened buttresses rising to wide arches at the upper levels after the manner of some Italian Romanesque facades. This style was adapted to suit commercial buildings by opening the spaces between the arches into large windows, the brick walls becoming a shell to a building that was essentially of modern steel-frame construction, the architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson]] giving his name to the style, [[Richardsonian Romanesque]]. Good examples of the style are Marshall Fields store, Chicago by H.H.Richardson, 1885, and the Chadwick Lead Works in [[Boston]] USA by [[William G. Preston|William Preston]], 1887. The style also lent itself to the building of cloth mills, steelworks and powerstations.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=NP&gt;Nikolaus Pevsner, ''An Outline of European Architecture''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mals, die Sankt Benedikt Kirche Dm15779 foto1 2012-08-13 10.44.jpg|thumb|]]

'''St. Benedikt''' is a pre-Romanesque church in [[Mals]], [[South Tyrol]], known for its [[Carolingian period|Carolingian-era]] frescoes.

It was built in the second half of the 8th century. Until the 12th century, it was owned by the [[bishops of Chur]]. 
In the 12th century, the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] tower was added.

In the 18th century, under [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the building was used for storage. Use as a sacral building was resumed only in the 20th century, after the discovery of the Carolingian frescoes.

The frescoes are dated to c. AD 800. They belong to a limited set of surviving frescoes of the Carolingian period, alongside those of the nearby St. Johann abbey in [[Val Müstair]], [[Grisons]].
The fresoes are mostly distributed in three [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] in the altar wall, showing [[Jesus Christ]] in the center, flanked by pope [[Gregory the Great]] and [[Saint Stephen]].
On the walls separating the niches are [[donor portrait]]s below a troop of twelve angels, and scenes showing Gregory writing his ''Dialogi'' and disputing with  [[Paulus Diaconus]], alongsides scenes showing [[Paul of Tarsus]] and a fragment of a scene from the life of [[Saint Benedict]].

[[File:Stella_Kramrisch_in_1978.jpg|thumb|right|Stella Kramrisch at the Himalayan Art installation at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in 1978.]]
'''Stella Kramrisch''' (1896-1993) was a cosmopolitan [[art historian]], who was well known as a specialist in [[Indian art]] and [[Hinduism]]. She researched and taught Indian art history for more than six decades on three continents. After writing her dissertation on the essence of early-buddhist sculpture in India, she was invited to teach at [[Kala Bhavana]] in [[Santiniketan|Shantiniketan]] (1922-24), from where she went on to a teaching post at [[Calcutta University]] (1924-1950). In Europe Kramrisch worked at the [[Courtauld Institute of Art|Courtauld Institute]], London (1937-1940). From 1950, she was professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in the Department of South Asia Regional Studies, where she had been recruited by [[W. Norman Brown]], in addition to being a curator at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploring India's Sacred Art. Selected Writings of Stella Kramrisch.|last=Stoller Miller|first=Barbara|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=1983|isbn=0812211340|location=Philadelphia|pages=3-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education in Vienna==
Stella Kramrisch was born on May 29, 1896 in Nikolsburg, now [[Mikulov]], in [[Austria]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/02/obituaries/stella-kramrisch-indian-art-expert-and-professor-97.html "Stella Kramrisch, Indian-Art Expert and Professor, 97"], ''The New York Times'', Retrieved 1 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; She was trained as a ballet dancer growing up in Austria. When Kramrisch was about 10 her parents moved to [[Vienna]]. One day she came across a translation of the [[Bhagavadgita]]: "I was so impressed it took my breath away."&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/1986-01-24/entertainment/26055249_1_indian-art-indian-painting-stella-kramrisch/2 A Meeting Of Art, India And Devotion - Page 2 - Philly.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; She had found what she wanted to do in her life. She enrolled at the [[University of Vienna]], studying at the department of art history with Professors [[Max Dvořák]] and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. She focused her studied on Indian art and culture. Thus she learned Sanskrit and read philosophy, literature and anthropology. In 1919, she successfully completed her studies by earning her doctorate.&lt;ref name="Sozanski"&gt;Sozanski, Edward J. [http://articles.philly.com/1993-09-01/entertainment/25988025_1_indian-art-curator-d-harnoncourt "Indian Art Expert S. Kramrisch Dies at 97"], ''Philly.com'', Retrieved 1 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Art historical work in India==
That year she traveled to London in 1919 as part of a university delegation to give three lectures at Oxford. [[Rabindranath Tagore]] heard her speak and invited her to come to India and teach at the [[Visva-Bharati University]] in [[Santiniketan]] in 1922. She was appointed professor of Indian art at the [[University of Calcutta]] in 1924, where she taught until 1950. In 1924 her first monograph "Essence of Indian art"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Grundzüge der Indischen Kunst|last=Kramrisch|first=Stella|publisher=Avalun Verlag|year=1924|location=Hellerau, Dresden|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in German, which was reviewed widely in various journals throughout Europe. In the 1920s Kramrisch kept travelling to Vienna to give lectures. Various articles of her colleagues in Vienna appear as English translations in the Journal of the [[Indian Society of Oriental Art,]] which Kramrisch edited from 1933 onwards together with [[Abanindranath Tagore]]. Her seminal publication "Indian sculpture" (1933) was a profound analysis of Indian sculpture, conceptualized in size and format to function as an actual handbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Sculpture. The Heritage of India Series.|last=Kramrisch|first=Stella|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1933|isbn=|location=London/New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the British left India in 1947, her husband Laszlo Nemenyi opted to work for the new government of [[Pakistan]] and moved to [[Karachi]]. In 1950 he was found shot dead on a beach. Only after this, she finally moved permanently to the [[United States]]. While in India, she had converted to [[Hinduism]], and begun a collection of South Asian art, later left to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061003060923/http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/kramrischs.htm Dictionary of Art Historians&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curator of Indian art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art==
Stella Kramrisch was the Professor of South Asian Art at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] for a long period of time. She was also the curator of Indian art at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] from 1954 until 1972, and was a Curator Emeritus until her death.&lt;ref name=Sozanski/&gt; In 1981 she curated ''Manifestations of Shiva'', a large-scale exhibition of Indian art and sculpture at the Museum, which was met with both critical and popular success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/information/45-603-503.html "History: 1980-1990"], Philadelphia Museum of Art, Retrieved 1 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Her books include ''The Hindu Temple'' (1946, still in print in India), "Principles of Indian Art", and the encyclopedic "The Presence of Siva". She was a friend of the ballerina, designer, actress, and collector [[Natacha Rambova]].{{fact|date=June 2018}} [[Barbara Stoler Miller]] and Wayne E. Begley were among her students.{{fact|date=June 2018}} Prof. Kramrisch was succeeded by [[Michael W. Meister]],{{when?|date=June 2018}} who is currently the W. Norman Brown Professor of South Asia Studies and History of Art at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==Death==
Kramrisch died on September 2, 1993 at her home in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Honors==
In 1982 the Indian government awarded Kramrisch with its [[Padma Bhushan]] award.&lt;ref name=Sozanski/&gt; In 1985 she was awarded the prestigious [[Charles Lang Freer Medal]] by the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name=Sozanski/&gt;

==Legacy==
At the time of her death, Kramrisch left a bequest of 25 works to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=Sozanski/&gt; In addition, Kramrisch's curatorial position was officially re-titled as the Stella Kramrisch Curator at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], a position which still exists today.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.philamuseum.org/pma_archives/ead.php?c=IND&amp;p=hn "Historical Note"], Philadelphia Museum of Art, Retrieved 1 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Six female art students and their teacher founded The Art League of Northern Virginia in 1954. The League's stated purpose was to foster art and arts appreciation, sponsor lectures, encourage study and hold exhibitions. In 1967, the organization was incorporated as a nonprofit, and in the years immediately following, the League removed rules limiting members to residents of Northern Virginia and shortened its name to The Art League, Inc.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;A History of The Art League, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The League's mission states, "By nurturing the artist, we enrich the community. The Art League develops the artist through education, exhibition, and a stimulating, supportive environment while sharing the experience of the visual arts with the community." &lt;ref name="The Art League"&gt;[http://www.theartleague.org/content/about The Art League]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art League played a critical role in the transformation of the City-owned, former U.S. Naval Torpedo Station into the Torpedo Factory Art Center.&lt;ref name="torpedo"&gt;Torpedo Factory Art Center. [http://www.torpedofactory.org/history.htm] Retrieved 8 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Art League president and Virginia Delegate [[Marian Van Landingham]] proposed a project that would renovate the building into working studio spaces for artists.&lt;ref&gt;National Women's History Project [http://nwhp.org/whm/landingham_bio.php] Retrieved 23 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; With the lease on its Cameron Street space expiring, The Art League was looking for a new location.&lt;ref&gt;Hagee, Chuck.

Retrieved 2012-01-20.&lt;/ref&gt; After the renovation of the new art center, the League rented one-fifth of the space for its gallery and school.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

{{See also|Torpedo Factory Art Center}}

Today, the gallery, offices, supply store, and some classrooms of The Art League are housed in the Torpedo Factory Art Center.

Continued growth led to the hiring of the first paid executive director, Cora Rupp, in 1981, along with other employees. In 2012, longtime executive director Linda Hafer retired, and Suzanne Bethel became the new executive director.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

==School==

The Art League School offers classes and workshops for students of all skill levels and ages, in nearly all of the fine visual arts. Classes and workshops are offered year-round in drawing, watercolor, painting, printmaking, photography, ceramics, sculpture, jewelry, fiber art, and clay animation, in addition to art travel workshops to domestic and international locations. Nearly 7,000 students enroll each year, filling over 10,000 seats in classes. All classes and workshops are taught by professional artist instructors, many from DC-area colleges and universities. Classes are noncredit and are open to all. After the school's founding in 1967, classes were credited with improving the quality of art in The Art League's Gallery, with ''Washingtonian Magazine'' writing, "the single most important thing The Art League has done to improve its image is to recruit a workshop faculty that includes some of the brightest luminaries on the art horizon."

Classes are held in the Torpedo Factory Art Center as well as the Madison Annex building. The Art League closed its Duke Street Annex in September 2012 and moved into an expanded classroom space on Madison Street.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

==Gallery==
[[File:Art league gallery 2011.jpg|thumb|The Art League Gallery in December 2011.]]
The Art League Gallery, located on the first floor of the Torpedo Factory Art Center, provides exhibit opportunities to more than 1,000 artists of all media and skill levels. Membership is open to any emerging or professional artist. Exhibits in the gallery rotate on a monthly basis. Each exhibit is juried by an outside professional not associated with The Art League.&lt;ref name="torpedo 2"&gt;Torpedo Factory Art Center. [http://www.torpedofactory.org/galleries/artleague.htm] Retrieved 8 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallery holds approximately 14 member exhibits each year, including both all-media, un-themed exhibits and themed, focused exhibits. The Gallery also presents approximately nine solo artist exhibits each year. The Bin Gallery includes works by artists who have been juried into three or more member exhibits during the previous fiscal year. Special exhibits, events, and collaborations are also periodically featured. The Gallery maintains a library of art and art history books and offers lectures, critiques, juror talks, demonstrations, workshops, and tours. [[File:Art league patrons show 2012.jpg|thumb|Patrons check out from the 2012 Patrons' Show.]]

Every winter, Art League members donate original works of art to be raffled off in the annual Patrons' Show Fundraiser, which sells about 600 tickets each year. The art is hung [[Salon (Paris)|salon]]-style in the gallery, with ticket-holders selecting a piece when their number is called.&lt;ref&gt;"The Art League's 42nd Annual Patrons' Show."

==Outreach==

In 2003, in partnership with the Alexandria Court Service Unit, The Art League established a mentoring program for at-risk girls in Alexandria, called A Space Of Her Own (SOHO).&lt;ref&gt;Vargas, Theresa. "Space of Her Own, an Alexandria Mentoring Program, Gives Girls Room Makeovers." ''The Washington Post''. 31 May 2009. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/30/AR2009053002027.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The SOHO program engages at-risk, low-income, 5th-grade girls in a year of personal growth centered on art. Each participating girl is paired with an adult, female mentor to partake in art lessons taught by an Art League instructor.  These sessions become the catalyst to discuss larger life concerns, decision-making, and emotional issues. At the completion of the program, the teams remodel each of the girls' bedrooms, incorporating all of their artwork, to give each girl a "space of her own.".&lt;ref name="pcah"&gt;City of Alexandria Press Release.

The animator, [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]] illustrated the original series of Nasrudin books, and also created a film animation featuring the character, titled ''The Thief and the Cobbler'', which was produced by Idries Shah's brother, [[Omar Ali-Shah]]. Unfortunately, this film was taken away from Williams before he had a chance to complete it.&lt;ref name="Mental Floss" /&gt;

In an article in the ''Los Angeles Review of Books'', writer John Zada uses the Sufi materials, including some of the Nasrudin tales, to explain developments in the contemporary world, such as the rise of Islamist fundamentalism under [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] and the rise of [[Donald Trump]].

'''''The Express''''' (also known as '''''The Express: The Ernie Davis Story''''') is a 2008 American [[List of sports films|sports film]] produced by [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]] and directed by [[Gary Fleder]]. The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by [[Charles Leavitt]] from a book titled ''Ernie Davis: The Elmira Express'', authored by Robert C. Gallagher. The film is based on the life of [[Syracuse University]] [[Syracuse Orange football|football]] player [[Ernie Davis]], the first [[African American]] to win the [[Heisman Trophy]], portrayed by actor [[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]]. ''The Express'' explores civil rights topics, such as racism, discrimination and athletics.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;[[Gary Fleder]]. (2008). ''The Express'' [Motion picture]. United States: [[Universal Pictures]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was a co-production between the film studios of [[Relativity Media]] and [[Davis Entertainment]]. It was commercially distributed by [[Universal Pictures]] theatrically, and by [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] for home media. [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Charles S. Dutton]] star in principal supporting roles. The original motion picture soundtrack with a musical score composed by [[Mark Isham]], was released by the [[Lakeshore Records]] label on October 28, 2008.

''The Express'' premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on October 10, 2008. Despite receiving generally positive reviews from critics, the film was a [[box office bomb]], grossing just $9.8 million against its $40 million budget. The [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] version of the film, featuring deleted scenes and the director's commentary was released on January 20, 2009.

==Plot==
[[Ernie Davis]] ([[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]]) is a young African American growing up in Pennsylvania with his same-age uncle Will Davis Jr. ([[Nelsan Ellis]]), in the late 1940s during a time of racism and discrimination. Davis lives with his extended family, including his grandfather, Willie 'Pops' Davis ([[Charles S. Dutton]]), who guides and educates him. Davis' mother, Marie Davis ([[Aunjanue Ellis]]), eventually returns to their residence to inform the family that she has remarried and can now afford to raise Ernie at her own home in [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Upon relocating to Elmira, Davis enrolls in a Small Fry Football League and excels on the field as a running back.

Several years later, Syracuse University football head coach [[Ben Schwartzwalder]] ([[Dennis Quaid]]) searches for a running back to address the absence of [[Jim Brown]] ([[Darrin Dewitt Henson]]), the graduating player completing his All-American senior season. Schwartzwalder is impressed with Davis after viewing footage of him playing for Elmira Free Academy. Schwartzwalder convinces Brown to accompany him on a recruiting visit to see Davis and his family in hopes of luring him to sign with Syracuse. After their visit, Davis decides to enroll at Syracuse and spurns the recruiting efforts of other colleges.

At the start of the 1959 college football season, Davis immediately excels playing for the varsity team, to lead Syracuse to victories over several college football teams. After Syracuse defeats UCLA to conclude the regular season undefeated, the team decides by choice to play the 2nd ranked Texas Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl Classic. During the game on January 1, 1960, Davis boldly attempts to lead his team to victory but is hampered by an injured leg and biased officiating. Towards the end of the game, Davis scores a crucial touchdown to preserve a Syracuse lead. The matchup concludes with a victory for Syracuse, and its first national championship.

In 1961, Davis goes on to win the Heisman Trophy following his senior season in college. He later becomes a professional athlete in the National Football League and signs a contract with the [[Cleveland Browns]]. Later however, following a series of health concerns, Davis is taken to a hospital to undergo medical testing. During a routine practice session, team owner [[Art Modell]] ([[Saul Rubinek]]) informs Davis he will be unable to play the upcoming season due to his condition. Subsequently, Davis holds a press conference and announces he has been diagnosed with leukemia. The Cleveland Browns honor Ernie by allowing him to suit up in uniform and join the team while running out before a televised game.

The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics stating that Davis died on May 18, 1963 at the age of 23; while in condolence, President Kennedy expresses sympathy for Davis' fine character as a citizen and an athlete.

==Production==

===Development===
The premise of ''The Express'' is based on the true story of [[Ernie Davis]], the charismatic athlete who became the first African American to win the [[Heisman Trophy]], college football's greatest achievement. Excelling in high school football, Davis was later recruited by dozens of predominantly white universities. A local sports columnist dubbed him the ''Elmira Express''.&lt;ref name=nfl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d80b75df1/article/ernie-davis-legacy-lives-on-long-after-his-death |title=Ernie Davis' legacy lives on long after his death |publisher=National Football League |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis was told of his terminal illness, leukemia, during the summer of 1962.&lt;ref name=nfl /&gt; According to a saddened Art Modell, he said "They told him as gently as they could that it was an incurable case of leukemia. It was awful, but the way he took it, it seemed like much more of a blow to me and his teammates than it was to him."&lt;ref name=nfl /&gt;

Following the NFL draft which saw the [[Washington Redskins]] trade their pick of Davis to Cleveland for Hall of Fame running back Bobby Mitchell, Davis signed a $100,000 contract with the Browns.&lt;ref name=nfl /&gt; On May 16, 1963, Davis visited [[Cleveland Browns]] owner Art Modell. He promised to make a career comeback even though he looked terminally ill.&lt;ref name=hnn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/articles/55556.html |title=Why Ernie Davis Matters |publisher=History News Network |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later on May 18, Davis died from the then-incurable disease. Fellow teammate and close friend [[John Brown (offensive tackle)|John Brown]], remembered him as a "genuine gentle man as well as a gentleman."&lt;ref name=hnn /&gt; President [[John F. Kennedy]] called Davis "an outstanding young man of great character" and "an inspiration to the young people of this country."&lt;ref name=hnn /&gt; The book titled ''Ernie Davis: The Elmira Express'', authored by writer Robert C. Gallagher, became the basis for the film.

===Set design and filming===
Filming began in April 2007 at [[Chicago]] area locations including [[Lane Technical High School]], [[Amundsen High School]], [[J. Sterling Morton High School District 201|J.

===Soundtrack===
The original motion picture soundtrack for ''The Express'' was released by the [[Lakeshore Records]] label on October 28, 2008. It features songs composed with considerable use of the [[violin]], [[trombone]] and [[violoncello|cello]]. The score for the film was orchestrated by [[Mark Isham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://music.barnesandnoble.com/Express/e/780163403022/?itm=27&amp;USRI=ernie+davis ''Express Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''].

Syracuse quarterback Dick Easterly, who played with Davis, said shortly after the movie's release, "I don't blame people in West Virginia for being disturbed.

The film suggests that Syracuse University had to win the 1960 Cotton Bowl to be named college football's national champion, when in fact the selection was made at the end of the regular season.  This practice did not change until the late-60's.

[[Bobby Lackey]], quarterback for the [[Texas Longhorns football (1950–59)#1959|1959 Texas Longhorns]], stated in 2008 that the racial tensions and Longhorn behavior depicted in the New Year's Day [[1960 Cotton Bowl Classic]] were made-up "stories to try and sell more movie tickets," and justifies the action of his roommate, Larry Stephens, as just "trying to get the guy (Davis) into a fight so he could get him thrown out of the game because their athletes were so much better than ours."&lt;ref&gt;Golden, Cedric (October 10, 2008).

Other inaccuracies are more along the line of the discrepancies in any fictionalized depiction of historical events. For example, the film places the 1959 Penn State game in the first three of Syracuse's season, with Syracuse winning 32-6, when it was actually the seventh game and Syracuse had their toughest challenge of the season, winning [[1959 Syracuse Orangemen football team#Schedule|a close 20-18 game]] to advance to a 7-0 record. The [[1960 Cotton Bowl Classic#Game summary|order of scoring]] in the 1960 Cotton Bowl Classic was adjusted in the film for dramatic tension.

[[Art Modell]] is shown giving [[Jim Brown]] his first [[Cleveland Browns]] [[Jersey (clothing)#In sports|jersey]] in a photo op, but Modell did not purchase the Browns until four years after Brown joined the team. The scene in which [[Washington Redskins]] owner [[George Preston Marshall]] and Modell arrange a major trade was actually made by Browns coach and general manager [[Paul Brown]] behind Modell's back, adding to the tension between the two.

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 61% based on 114 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "This inspirational sports biopic set in the civil rights era is interesting even for non-football fans, and features a great performance by Dennis Quaid as tough-but-fair football coach."&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1185801-the_express/ The Express (2008)]. [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. IGN Entertainment.

[[Roger Ebert]] wrote: "''The Express'' is involving and inspiring in the way a good movie about sports almost always is. The formula is basic and durable, and when you hitch it to a good story, you can hardly fail. Gary Fleder does more than that in telling the story of Ernie Davis ("The Elmira Express"), the running back for Syracuse who became the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy, in 1961."&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;Ebert, Roger (October 8, 2008).

Fleder (expertly assisted by cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau and editors Padraic McKinley and William Steinkamp) ices the cake with some first-rate game footage."&lt;ref name="lane" /&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called it "special" while remarking, "There is a lot of football in the movie. It's well presented, but there is the usual oddity that it almost entirely shows mostly success."&lt;ref name="ebert" /&gt; 

In the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Peter Hartlaub wrote that the film "deserves plenty of credit for abandoning the ''"Remember the Titans"/"Glory Road"'' school of screenwriting as laid out above and exploring the racial issues in Davis' story in more realistic terms." He thought Quaid gave a "memorable performance" by portraying Schwartzwalder as "sort of an accidental civil rights hero."&lt;ref&gt;Hartlaub, Peter (October 10, 2008).

Commenting on the segregational history, he said "we have to suffer apologetic non-dramas like this, the story of a fleet-footed black footballer (Rob Brown) who hits the big time just as his racial conscience starts to bother him".

He didn't believe Davis was "as bland as ''"The Express"'' makes him out to be. Aside from managing to get made at all, the movie doesn't do Davis's legacy any favors by giving us the store-brand version of his life."&lt;ref name="morris" /&gt; Morris however, was quick to admit "There is so much ripe material here for a socially or historically curious movie." But he frustratingly noted that the filmmakers were more interested in "making a safely commercial football drama that doesn't deviate from the genre's shorthand imagery and plot points."&lt;ref name="morris"&gt;Morris, Wesley (October 10, 2008).

On its production merits, he commented how the film displayed "Terrific editing by William Steinkamp and Padraic McKinley" which "intermarries the onfield action, flashbacks to Davis' Southern boyhood, a smattering of period footage and a great deal of stylized visualization to a degree that distracts from the very basic sports-movie arc of the story".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John (September 28, 2008).

He thought Brown portrayed Davis with "quiet subtlety (to the point where he almost disappears in some scenes)" and felt Quaid was "stuck with the thankless role of accidental civil-rights pioneer". He summed up his disappointment stating, "like all formulaic biopics, ''The Express'' sacrifices the details for the Big Picture—hagiography without the humanity (wait, is that his girlfriend? Wife?
