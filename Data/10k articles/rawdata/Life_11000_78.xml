'''442oons''' is an English [[YouTube]] [[animation]] [[parody]] channel set up in 2013. The channel focuses on animated [[association football]] parodies, such as [[Premier League]], [[La Liga]] and [[Bundesliga]] matches. He now works with Bundesliga to make weekly videos on the channel.

==Career==
The channels' creator, Dean Stobbart, originally a teacher from [[Norton, County Durham]], had in the past been a part-time voice actor, along with being a professional actor starring in productions on the West End including Our House (musical) and also did some animation for his lessons. He said he saw a gap in the market that "no one had really done football cartoons before", so he used CrazyTalk (Animator software) to make his first animated video, a parody of [[Luis Su√°rez]] and former [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] manager [[Ars√®ne Wenger]] in a cartoon parody of a scene from [[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|''The Silence of the Lambs'']]. The video currently has 2.312 million views and was followed up with another Su√°rez-themed video which has received more than fourteen million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLhUgkO7Zxg|title=üòÅLUIS SUAREZ BITEüòÅ by 442oons (Suarez Evra Ivanovic football cartoon) Seven Sins of Suarez|last=|first=|date=2018-08-24|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then he has worked with organisations such as ''[[TalkSport]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talksport.com/football/best-football-april-fool-them-all-442oons-sends-bayern-munich-stars-150401141853|title=The best football April Fool of them all? 442oons sends up Bayern Munich stars|first=|last=talkSPORT|date=1 April 2015|publisher=|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talksport.com/football/mourinho-v-sterling-video-footage-you-didnt-see-liverpool-v-chelsea-150121133222|title=Mourinho v Sterling: The video footage YOU DIDN'T SEE from Liverpool v Chelsea!|first=Craig|last=Bloomfield|date=21 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[SkySports]]'' on animations.

{{chola history}}

'''Aditya I''' (c. 870  ‚Äì c. 907 CE), the son of [[Vijayalaya Chola|Vijayalaya]], was the [[Chola]] king who extended the Chola dominions by the conquest of the [[Pallavas]] and occupied the [[Western Ganga Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="sen2"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=46‚Äì49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pallava Civil War ==

During the [[Vijayalaya Chola#Pandyan invasion|invasion of the Chola country]], the Pandya king [[Varagunavarman II]] became an ally of Nripatunga, the eldest son of the Pallava King [[Nandivarman III]].

When Nandivarman died in 869 CE differences arose between Nripatunga and his stepbrother [[Aparajitavarman|Aparajita]], probably owing to the latter‚Äôs ambition to rule the kingdom on his own right. Both sides looked for allies. Nripatunga continued to have Varaguna Pandya by his side while Aparajita allied with the [[Western Ganga Dynasty|Ganga]] king Prithvipathi I and with Aditya Chola I. According to some descriptions Aparajitha was found to be noted as son of Nirpatunga Varma, and his mother was noted as Prithivi Manikam daughter of Ganga king. So the Contention that Prithivapathi 1 gone against Nirpatunga was totally un accepatable 
The rival armies met at Thirupurambiyam near [[Kumbakonam]] c. 885 CE. The armies of Pandyas and Nripatunga Pallava were routed by Aparajita Pallava and Aditya I Chola. But Some Inscriptions purely clarified Nirpatunga Was not alive during the war.{{cn|date=February 2018}} So it is the war between Pallvas and Pandiyas to establish Legal Supremacy

== Ascendancy ==
{{anchor|}}
{{anchor|Ascendancy|Aditya I's Ascendancy}}
Although the victor of the Thirupurambiyam battle was Aparajita, the real gains went to Aditya I Chola. This battle ensured the end of Pandya power in the south. Pandya Varagunavarman renounced his throne and followed an [[ascetic]] life. The grateful Aparajita not only allowed Aditya I Chola to keep the territories won by Vijayalaya Chola, but also to add new territories from the defeated Pandyas.

== Invasion of the Pallava Country ==
&lt;!-- "Article" links here --&gt;
{{anchor|Invasion of the Pallava Country|Aditya I‚Äôs invasion of the Pallava Country}}

During 903 CE, the 32nd year of his reign, Aditya I Chola, not satisfied with his subordinate position, planned and carried out an attack on his erstwhile overlord, the Pallava king Aparajita. In the battle that ensued, Aditya pounced upon Aparajita when he was mounted on an elephant and killed him. That spelt the end of the Pallava rule in [[History of Chennai#Ancient area in South India|Tondaimandalam]] (north [[Tamil Nadu]]) and the whole of the Pallava kingdom became Chola territory. This marked the effective end of the once great Pallava empire in the history of South India. {{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The conquest of the Tondaimandalam earned for Aditya I the epithet "''Tondainadu pavina Rajakesarivarman''" (‡Æ§‡Øä‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡Øà‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æü‡ØÅ ‡Æ™‡Ææ‡Æµ‡Æø‡Æ© ‡Æá‡Æ∞‡Ææ‡Æö‡Æï‡Øá‡Æö‡Æ∞‡Æø‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Øç‡ÆÆ‡Æ©‡Øç) - "Rajakesarivarman who overran Tondainadu".

== The Conquest of Kongu ==

Aditya I next conquered the Kongu country in the south west of Tamil Nadu, perhaps from the Pandya king Viranarayana.

== Relations with the Cheras ==

Friendly relations appear to have existed between the [[Chera dynasty|Chera]]s and the Cholas during the reign of Aditya&amp;nbsp; I.  The Chera contemporary Sthanu Ravi is stated in inscriptions to have received royal honours from Aditya. AdityaI ‚Äôs son, [[Parantaka I]], married a daughter of Sthanu Ravi.

== Aditya‚Äôs contributions to Temples==

Aditya I is known to have built a number of temples 108 for [[Shiva]] along the banks of the [[Kaveri]]. The Kanyakumari inscription gives us the information that Aditya I was also known by the surname '''Kodandarama'''. There is a temple near the town of  Tondaimanarrur called ''Kodandarameshvaraa'', also mentioned in its inscriptions by the name ''Adityesvara''. This seems to have been built by Aditya I. He also revised Annamalaiyar sanctum in Thiruvaannamalai during 872{{spaced ndash}}900. Aditya also was the patron of Sureswara aand prabhakara who were pupils of kumarila bhatta a favourite student of Adisankaracharya. The author of that work do confirm that they settled in the banks of Kaveri (Sibishu kaveriteere meaning in the country of cholas (Sibi is an ancestor of Cholas)) and were employed by Manukula Adityan (Aditya Chola).

== Death and Succession ==

In an inscription Aditya{{&amp;nbsp}}I is distinguished by the epithet in Tamil{{spaced ndash}}(‡Æ§‡Øä‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡Øà‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Æ∞‡ØÇ‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡Æ§‡ØÅ‡Æû‡Øç‡Æö‡Æø‡Æ© ‡Æâ‡Æü‡Øà‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç ''Thondaimaanaruur thunjina udaiyaar''). "The king who died at Tondaimanarrur". Aditya{{&amp;nbsp}}I died in 907 CE at Tondaimanarrur. His son [[Parantaka I]] built a Shiva temple over his ashes. Aditya{{&amp;nbsp}}I was survived by his queens ''Ilangon Pichchi'' and ''Vayiri Akkan'' alias ''Tribhuvana Madeviyar''. Besides these two queens, Aditya{{&amp;nbsp}}I also had a mistress named ''Nangai Sattaperumanar'' as evidenced from an inscription.

Aditya{{&amp;nbsp}}I had a long and victorious reign during which he laid the foundation of the future greatness of the Chola empire.

'''Adolph, Count of Oldenburg-Delmenhorst''' ({{lang-de|Adolf (Alf) von Oldenburg}}; b. before 1463 - 17 February 1500) was a [[Count of Oldenburg]] from 1482 until his death.

== Biography ==
Adolph was the eldest surviving son of [[Gerhard VI, Count of Oldenburg]]. His father, overcome by the forces of the [[Frisians]] and the [[Prince-Bishopric of M√ºnster|bishopric of M√ºnster]], was forced to abdicate in 1482. Adolph then succeeded him as head of the county of Oldenburg alongside his younger brother, [[John V, Count of Oldenburg|John V]]. Captured by the Frisians in November 1483, Adolph was released after the cessation of hostilities in October 1486, against a ransom of 3,500 [[florin]]s.&lt;ref name=Schmidt14&gt;Schmidt, Heinrich. "Adolf" in ''Biographisches Handbuch zur Geshichte des Landes Oldenburg'', Isensee Verlag, 1992. {{ISBN|3-89442-135-5}}, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after Adolph was released, the county government remained in the hands of his brother John V. Adolph accepted this situation and dedicated himself to the war. With his other brother Otto, he participated in the campaign of Duke [[Magnus I, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg|Magnus I of Saxe-Lauenburg]] against the Frisians of [[Land Wursten|Wursten]], then an area of free peasant under the loose overlordship of the [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen]], which ended in failure in 1499 due to the defense coalition built up by Prince-Archbishop [[Johann Rode von Wale|John III]]. The following year, Adolph and Otto participated to the war against [[Dithmarschen|Dithmarses]], fighting in the army of their cousin [[John, King of Denmark|King John of Denmark]]. However, the two brothers died on 17 February 1500, during the [[Battle of Hemmingstedt]], which ended in a Danish defeat.&lt;ref name="Schmidt14" /&gt;

'''Anterior cerebral artery syndrome''' is a condition whereby the blood supply from the [[anterior cerebral artery]] (ACA) is restricted, leading to a reduction of the function of the portions of the [[brain]] supplied by that vessel: the medial aspects of the frontal and parietal lobes, [[basal ganglia]], anterior [[fornix of the brain|fornix]] and anterior [[corpus callosum]].&lt;ref name= "O'Sullivan" /&gt;

Depending upon the area and severity of the occlusion, signs and symptoms may vary within the population affected with ACA syndrome. Blockages to the proximal (A1) segment of the vessel produce only minor deficits due to the collateral blood flow from the opposite hemisphere via the [[anterior communicating artery]]. Occlusions distal to this segment will result in more severe presentation of ACA syndrome. Contralateral [[hemiparesis]] and hemisensory loss of the lower extremity is the most common symptom associated with ACA syndrome.&lt;ref name= "O'Sullivan" /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

# [[Hemiparesis]] or [[hemiplegia]] contralaterally, involving primarily the lower limbs and [[pelvic floor]] musculature
# Sensory deficits contralaterally, involving primarily the leg and perineum
# [[Apraxia]] (due to branches to the [[supplementary motor area]] and [[corpus callosum]])&lt;ref name= "O'Sullivan" /&gt;
# Disconnection syndrome (due to callosal branches)
# [[Anosmia]] (due to branches of the olfactory bulb and olfactory tract)
# [[Urinary incontinence]]&lt;ref name= "O'Sullivan" /&gt;
# [[Grasp reflex]] and or [[sucking reflex]] contralaterally (if [[circle of Willis]] compromised)&lt;ref name= "O'Sullivan" /&gt;

The '''argument from free will''', also called the '''paradox of free will''' or '''[[Theological determinism|theological fatalism]]''', contends that [[omniscience]] and [[free will]] are [[Incompatible-properties argument|incompatible]] and that any conception of [[God]] that incorporates both properties is therefore inherently [[Contradiction|contradictory]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;See the various [[Omniscience#Controversies|controversies]] over claims of God's omniscience, in particular the critical notion of [[predestination|foreknowledge]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-will-foreknowledge/ Foreknowledge and Free Will]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/foreknow|title=Foreknowledge and Free Will|last=Swartz|first=Norman|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of [[predestination]].

==Omniscience and free will==
[[File:Chess-king.JPG|thumb|right|150px|If God made the game, its rules, and the players, then how can any player be free?]]
Some arguments against the [[existence of God]] focus on the supposed incoherence of humankind possessing [[free will]] and God's [[omniscience]]. These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of [[predestination]].

[[Moses Maimonides]] formulated an argument regarding a person's free will, in traditional terms of good and evil actions, as follows:

{{quote|‚Ä¶ "Does God know or does He not know that a certain individual will be good or bad? If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that the man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand how he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect.‚Ä¶"&lt;ref name=maimonides&gt;''The Eight Chapters of Maimonides on Ethics (Semonah Perakhim)'', edited, annotated, and translated with an Introduction by Joseph I. Gorfinkle, pp. 99‚Äì100. (New York: AMS Press), 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A logical formulation of this argument might go as follows:&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;
# God knows choice "C" that a human would claim to "make freely".
# It is now necessary that C.
# If it is now necessary that C, then C cannot be otherwise (this is the definition of ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù). That is, there are no actual "possibilities" due to predestination.
# If you cannot do otherwise when you act, you do not act freely (Principle of Alternate Possibilities)
# Therefore, when you do an act, you will not do it freely.

[[Norman Swartz]], however, contends that the above arguments commit the [[modal fallacy]]. In particular, he asserts that these arguments assume that if C is true, it becomes necessary for C to be true, which is incorrect as C is contingent (see [[Modal logic | modal logic]]). Otherwise, one can argue that the future is set already regardless of his actions.&lt;ref name=iep /&gt;

Other means of reconciling God's omniscience with human free will have been proposed. Some have attempted to redefine or reconceptualize free will:
* God can know in advance what I will do, because free will is to be understood only as freedom from [[coercion]], and anything further is an illusion. This is the move made by [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic]] philosophies.
* The sovereignty (autonomy) of God, existing within a free agent, provides strong inner compulsions toward a course of action (calling), and the power of choice (election). The actions of a human are thus determined by a human acting on relatively strong or weak urges (both from God and the environment around them) and their own relative power to choose.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosopher's Handbook'', Stanley Rosen, ed., Random House Reference, New York, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposition first offered by [[Boethius]]&lt;ref&gt;''Consolatio Philosophiae'', Boethius, book 5:4&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Thomas Aquinas]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;See also ''[[Divine Providence]]'' versus the concept of [[Destiny|Fate]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C. S. Lewis]], suggests that God's perception of time is different, and that this is relevant to our understanding of our own free will. In his book ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', Lewis argues that God is actually outside time and therefore does not "foresee" events, but rather simply observes them all at once. He explains:
{{quote|But suppose God is outside and above the Time-line. In that case, what we call "tomorrow" is visible to Him in just the same way as what we call "today". All the days are "Now" for Him. He does not remember you doing things yesterday, He simply sees you doing them: because, though you have lost yesterday, He has not. He does not "foresee" you doing things tomorrow, He simply sees you doing them: because, though tomorrow is not yet there for you, it is for Him. You never supposed that your actions at this moment were any less free because God knows what you are doing. Well, He knows your tomorrow's actions in just the same way‚Äîbecause He is already in tomorrow and can simply watch you. In a sense, He does not know your action till you have done it: but then the moment at which you have done it is already "Now" for Him.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis ''Mere Christianity'' Touchstone:New York, 1980 p.149&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A common objection is to argue that [[Molinism]], or the belief that God can know counterfactually the actions of his creations, is true. This has been used as an argument by [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[William Lane Craig]], amongst others.

==Freewill argument for the nonexistence of God==
[[Dan Barker]] suggests that this can lead to a "Freewill Argument for the Nonexistence of God"&lt;ref&gt;''The Freewill Argument for the Nonexistence of God'' by Dan Barker, [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] [https://ffrf.org/legacy/about/bybarker/fang.php]&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that God's omniscience is incompatible with God having free will and that if God does not have freewill God is not a [[personal God|personal being]].

Theists generally agree that God is a personal being and that God is [[omniscience|omniscient]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;see e.g. [[Richard Swinburne]] ''Does God Exist?'' of ''The Catechism of the Catholic Church''&lt;/ref&gt; but there is some disagreement about whether "omniscient" means:
# "knows everything that God chooses to know and that is logically possible to know"; Or instead the slightly stronger:
# "knows everything that is logically possible to know"&lt;ref group=note&gt;see e.g. [[John Polkinghorne]]&lt;/ref&gt;

These two terms are known as ''inherent'' and ''total'' omniscience, respectively.

'''Ariobarzanes''' ({{lang-grc|·ºàœÅŒπŒøŒ≤Œ±œÅŒ∂Œ¨ŒΩŒ∑œÇ}}, in [[Old Persian]]: ''*ƒÄriya-b·πõdƒÅna-'', meaning "exalting the Aryans") also spelled as '''Ario Barzan''' or '''Aryo Barzan''' ({{lang-fa|ÿ¢ÿ±€åŸàÿ®ÿ±ÿ≤ŸÜ}}); died 330 BC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Shahbazi |first=A. Sh. | title=ARIOBARZANES | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica | accessdate=2008-03-05|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ariobarzanes-greek-form-of-old-iranian-proper-name-arya-brzana}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Ariobarzanes the Brave''',{{cn|date=July 2018}} was an [[Achaemenid]] [[prince]], [[satrap]] and a [[Persian people|Persian]] military commander who led a [[last stand]] of the Persian army at the [[Battle of the Persian Gate]] against Macedonian King [[Alexander the Great]] in the winter of 330 BC.

==Life==
Though the exact birth-date of Ariobarzanes is unknown, it is speculated that he was born around 368 BC. His sister was the ancient Persian noblewoman and warrior [[Youtab]].  Ariobarzanes was made satrap of [[Persis]] (the southern province of [[Fars Province|Fars]] in present-day [[Iran]]) in 335 BC by [[Darius III Codomannus]]. Historians are surprised that Darius III appointed a satrap for [[Persepolis]] and [[Persis]]; apparently that office did not previously exist. Ariobarzanes commanded part of the Persian Army fighting against the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] in 331 BC.

==Death==
Following the Persian defeat at Gaugamela, Darius realized he could not defend his capital [[Persepolis]] and travelled east to rebuild his armies, leaving Ariobarzanes in command. Meanwhile, Alexander the Great split his army and led his 14,000-strong force towards the Persian capital via the [[Persian Gates]]. There Ariobarzanes successfully ambushed Alexander the Great's army, inflicting heavy casualties. The Persian success at the [[Battle of the Persian Gate]] was short lived though; after being held off for 30 days, Alexander the Great outflanked and destroyed the defenders. Some sources indicate that the Persians were betrayed by a captured tribal chief who showed the Macedonians an alternate path that allowed them to outflank Ariobarzanes in a reversal of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]]. Ariobarzanes himself was killed either during the battle or during the retreat to Persepolis. Afterwards, Alexander continued towards Persepolis, seizing the city and its treasury, and eventually looting the city months after its fall.

[[File:Autoencoder_structure.png|350x350px|Schematic structure of an autoencoder with 3 fully connected hidden layers.|thumb]]
An '''autoencoder''' is a type of [[artificial neural network]] used to learn [[Feature learning|efficient data codings]] in an [[unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2008.04.030|title=Modeling word perception using the Elman network|journal=Neurocomputing|volume=71|issue=16‚Äì18|pages=3150|year=2008|last1=Liou|first1=Cheng-Yuan|last2=Huang|first2=Jau-Chi|last3=Yang|first3=Wen-Chie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2013.09.055|title=Autoencoder for words|journal=Neurocomputing|volume=139|pages=84|year=2014|last1=Liou|first1=Cheng-Yuan|last2=Cheng|first2=Wei-Chen|last3=Liou|first3=Jiun-Wei|last4=Liou|first4=Daw-Ran}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for [[dimensionality reduction]]. Recently, the autoencoder concept has become more widely used for learning [[generative model]]s of data.&lt;ref name="VAE"&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1312.6114|author1=Diederik P Kingma|title=Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes|last2=Welling|first2=Max|class=stat.ML|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gan_faces"&gt;Generating Faces with Torch, Boesen A., Larsen L. and Sonderby S.K., 2015 {{url|http://torch.ch/blog/2015/11/13/gan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most powerful AI in the 2010s have involved sparse autoencoders stacked inside of deep neural networks.&lt;ref name=domingos&gt;{{cite book |first1=Pedro |last1=Domingos |author-link=Pedro Domingos|year=2015|title=[[The Master Algorithm|The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World]] |publisher= Basic Books |isbn= 978-046506192-1 |chapter=4 |at= "Deeper into the Brain" subsection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
An autoencoder learns to compress data from the input layer into a short code, and then uncompress that code into something that closely matches the original data. This forces the autoencoder to engage in dimensionality reduction, for example by learning how to ignore noise. Some architectures use stacked sparse autoencoder layers for image recognition. The first autoencoder might learn to encode easy features like corners, the second to analyze the first layer's output and then encode less local features like the tip of a nose, the third might encode a whole nose, etc., until the final autoencoder encodes the whole image into a code that matches (for example) the concept of "cat".&lt;ref name=domingos/&gt; An alternative use is as a generative model: for example, if a system is manually fed the codes it has learned for "cat" and "flying", it may attempt to generate an image of a flying cat, even if it has never seen a flying cat before.&lt;ref name="VAE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hutson|first1=Matthew|title=New algorithm can create movies from just a few snippets of text|journal=Science|date=23 February 2018|doi=10.1126/science.aat4126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Architecturally, the simplest form of an autoencoder is a [[feedforward neural network|feedforward]], non-[[recurrent neural network|recurrent]] neural network very similar to the many single layer perceptrons which makes a [[multilayer perceptron]] (MLP) ‚Äì having an input layer, an output layer and one or more hidden layers connecting them ‚Äì but with the output layer having the same number of nodes as the input layer, and with the purpose of ''reconstructing'' its own inputs (instead of predicting the target value &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; given inputs &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;). Therefore, autoencoders are [[unsupervised learning]] models.

An autoencoder always consists of two parts, the encoder and the decoder, which can be defined as transitions &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi,&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi:\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\psi:\mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi,\psi = \underset{\phi,\psi}{\operatorname{arg\,min}}\, \|X-(\psi \circ \phi) X\|^2&lt;/math&gt;

In the simplest case, where there is one hidden layer, the encoder stage of an autoencoder takes the input &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d = \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; and maps it to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{R}^p = \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z} = \sigma(\mathbf{Wx}+\mathbf{b})&lt;/math&gt;

This image &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}&lt;/math&gt; is usually referred to as ''code'', ''latent variables'', or ''latent representation''. Here, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is an element-wise [[activation function]] such as a [[sigmoid function]] or a [[rectified linear unit]].  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{W}&lt;/math&gt; is a weight matrix and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; is a bias vector. After that, the decoder stage of the autoencoder maps &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}&lt;/math&gt; to the ''reconstruction'' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x'}&lt;/math&gt; of the same shape as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x'} = \sigma'(\mathbf{W'z}+\mathbf{b'})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\sigma'}, \mathbf{W'}, \text{ and }\mathbf{b'}&lt;/math&gt; for the decoder may differ in general from the corresponding &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\sigma}, \mathbf{W}, \text{ and } \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; for the encoder, depending on the design of the autoencoder.

Autoencoders are also trained to minimise reconstruction errors (such as [[Mean squared error|squared errors]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x'})=\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x'}\|^2=\|\mathbf{x}-\sigma'(\mathbf{W'}(\sigma(\mathbf{Wx}+\mathbf{b}))+\mathbf{b'})\|^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is usually averaged over some input training set.

If the [[feature (machine learning)|feature space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; has lower dimensionality than the input space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;, then the feature vector &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as a [[Data compression|compressed]] representation of the input &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. If the hidden layers are larger than the input layer, an autoencoder can potentially learn the [[identity function]] and become useless. However, experimental results have shown that autoencoders might still [[feature learning|learn useful features]] in these cases.&lt;ref name="bengio"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bengio|first1=Y.|year=2009|title=Learning Deep Architectures for AI|url=http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/TR1312.pdf|journal=Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning|volume=2|pages=1|doi=10.1561/2200000006|pmc=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}}

===Variations===

Various techniques exist to prevent autoencoders from learning the identity function and to improve their ability to capture important information and learn richer representations:

====Denoising autoencoder====

Denoising autoencoders take a partially corrupted input whilst training to recover the original undistorted input. This technique has been introduced with a specific approach to ''good'' representation.&lt;ref name="ref9"&gt;{{cite journal
 | last1 = Vincent 
 | first1 = Pascal
 | last2 = Larochelle
 | first2 = Hugo
 | last3 = Lajoie 
 | first3 = Isabelle

 | volume = 11
 | pages = 3371‚Äì3408
 | date = 2010
 | url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1953039}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''good'' representation is one that can be obtained [[Robustness (computer science)|robustly]] from a corrupted input and that will be useful for recovering the corresponding clean input.'' This definition contains the following implicit assumptions:

* The higher level representations are relatively stable and robust to the corruption of the input; 
* It is necessary to extract features that are useful for representation of the input distribution.

To train an autoencoder to denoise data, it is necessary to perform preliminary stochastic mapping &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{\tilde{x}}&lt;/math&gt; in order to corrupt the data and use &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\tilde{x}}&lt;/math&gt; as input for a normal autoencoder, with the only exception being that the [[Loss function|loss]] should still be computed for the initial input &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\tilde{x}'})&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{\tilde{x}},\mathbf{\tilde{x}'})&lt;/math&gt;.

====Sparse autoencoder====

Autoencoders were originally invented in the 1980s; however, the initial versions were difficult to train, as the encodings have to compete to set the same small set of bits. This was solved by "sparse autoencoding". In a sparse autoencoder, there are actually more (rather than fewer) hidden units than inputs, but only a small number of the hidden units are allowed to be active at the same time.&lt;ref name=domingos/&gt;

Sparsity may be achieved by additional terms in the [[loss function]] during training (by [[Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence|comparing the probability distribution]] of the hidden unit activations with some low desired value),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=sparse autoencoders|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs294a/sparseAutoencoder.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by manually zeroing all but the few strongest hidden unit activations (referred  to as a ''k-sparse autoencoder'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|title=k-sparse autoencoder|eprint=1312.5663|last1=Makhzani|first1=Alireza|last2=Frey|first2=Brendan|class=cs.LG|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Variational autoencoder (VAE)====

Variational autoencoder models inherit autoencoder architecture, but make strong assumptions concerning the distribution of latent variables. They use [[Variational Bayesian methods|variational approach]] for latent representation learning, which results in an additional loss component and specific training algorithm called ''Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB)''.&lt;ref name="VAE" /&gt; It assumes that the data is generated by a directed [[graphical model]] &lt;math&gt;p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})&lt;/math&gt; and that the encoder is learning an approximation &lt;math&gt;q_{\phi}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; to the [[Posterior probability|posterior distribution]] &lt;math&gt;p_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; denote the parameters of the encoder (recognition model) and decoder (generative model) respectively. The objective of the variational autoencoder in this case has the following form:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{\phi},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{x})=D_{\mathrm{KL}}(q_{\phi}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})\Vert p_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}))-\mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}\big(\log p_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})\big)&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;D_{\mathrm{KL}}&lt;/math&gt; stands for the [[Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence]]. The prior over the latent variables is usually set to be the centred isotropic multivariate Gaussian &lt;math&gt;p_{\theta}(\mathbf{z})=\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0,I})&lt;/math&gt;; however, alternative configurations have also been recently considered, e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2017.02.028|title=Asymmetric deep generative models|journal=Neurocomputing|volume=241|pages=90|year=2017|last1=Partaourides|first1=Harris|last2=Chatzis|first2=Sotirios P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Contractive autoencoder (CAE) ====
Contractive autoencoder adds an explicit regularizer in their objective function that forces the model to learn a function that is robust to slight variations of input values. This regularizer corresponds to the [[Frobenius norm]] of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian matrix]] of the encoder activations with respect to the input. The final objective function has the following form:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x'}) + \lambda \sum_i || \nabla_x h_i ||^2&lt;/math&gt;

===Relationship with principal component analysis (PCA)===
If linear activations are used, or only a single sigmoid hidden layer, then the optimal solution to an autoencoder is strongly related to [[principal component analysis]] (PCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Bourlard | first1 = H. | last2 = Kamp | first2 = Y. | doi = 10.1007/BF00332918 | title = Auto-association by multilayer perceptrons and singular value decomposition | journal = Biological Cybernetics | volume = 59 | issue = 4‚Äì5 | pages = 291‚Äì294 | year = 1988 | pmid =  3196773| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1145/2649387.2649442|chapter=Deep autoencoder neural networks for gene ontology annotation predictions|title=Proceedings of the 5th ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics - BCB '14|pages=533|year=2014|last1=Chicco|first1=Davide|last2=Sadowski|first2=Peter|last3=Baldi|first3=Pierre|isbn=9781450328944}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weights of an autoencoder with a single hidden layer of size &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is less than the size of the input) span the same vector subspace as the one spanned by the first &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; principal components, and the output of the autoencoder is an orthogonal projection onto this subspace. The autoencoder weights are not equal to the principal components, and are generally not orthogonal, yet the principal components may be recovered from them using the [[Gram-Schmidt process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Plaut|first1=E|title=From Principal Subspaces to Principal Components with Linear Autoencoders|eprint=1804.10253|date=2018|class=stat.ML}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
The training algorithm for an autoencoder can be summarized as
:For each input {{mvar|x}},
::Do a feed-forward pass to compute activations at all hidden layers, then at the output layer to obtain an output &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x'}&lt;/math&gt;
::Measure the deviation of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x'}&lt;/math&gt; from the input &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; (typically using [[Mean squared error|squared error]]),
::[[Backpropagation|Backpropagate]] the error through the net and perform weight updates.

An autoencoder is often trained using one of the many variants of [[backpropagation]] (such as [[conjugate gradient method]], [[steepest descent]], etc.). Though these are often reasonably effective, there are fundamental problems with the use of backpropagation to train networks with many hidden layers. Once errors are backpropagated to the first few layers, they become minuscule and insignificant. This means that the network will almost always learn to reconstruct the average of all the training data.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Though more advanced backpropagation methods (such as the conjugate gradient method) can solve this problem to a certain extent, they still result in a very slow learning process and poor solutions. This problem can be remedied by using initial weights that approximate the final solution. The process of finding these initial weights is often referred to as ''pretraining''.

Stephen Luttrell, while based at [[RSRE]], developed a technique for unsupervised training of hierarchical self-organizing neural nets with "many hidden layers",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Luttrell |first=S. P. |chapter-url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/51919 |chapter=Hierarchical self-organising networks |title=1989 First IEE International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks |pages=2‚Äì6 |location=London |publisher=Institution of Engineering and Technology|date=October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are equivalent to deep autoencoders. [[Geoffrey Hinton]] developed an alternative pretraining technique for training many-layered deep autoencoders. This method involves treating each neighbouring set of two layers as a [[restricted Boltzmann machine]] so that the pretraining approximates a good solution, then using a backpropagation technique to fine-tune the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hinton|first1=G. E.|last2=Salakhutdinov|first2=R.R.|title=Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks|journal=Science|date=28 July 2006|volume=313|issue=5786|pages=504‚Äì507|doi=10.1126/science.1127647|bibcode=2006Sci...313..504H}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model takes the name of [[deep belief network]].

'''Bioelectronics''' is a field of research in the convergence of [[biology]] and [[electronics]].

==Definitions==
[[Image:Protein translation.gif|thumb|300px| A [[ribosome]] is a [[biological machine]] that utilizes [[protein dynamics]]]]
At the first C.E.C. Workshop, in Brussels in November 1991, bioelectronics was defined as 'the use of biological materials and biological architectures for information processing systems and new devices'. Bioelectronics, specifically bio-molecular electronics, were described as 'the research and development of bio-inspired (i.e. self-assembly) inorganic and organic materials and of bio-inspired (i.e. massive parallelism) hardware architectures for the implementation of new information processing systems, sensors and actuators, and for molecular manufacturing down to the atomic scale'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicolini | first1 = C | year = 1995 | title = From neural chip and engineered biomolecules to bioelectronic devices: an overview | url = | journal = Biosens Bioelectron | volume = 10 | issue = 1‚Äì2| pages = 105‚Äì27 | pmid = 7734117 | doi=10.1016/0956-5663(95)96799-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, defined bioelectronics in a 2009 report as "the discipline resulting from the convergence of biology and electronics".&lt;ref name=nist&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.nist.gov/pml/div683/upload/bioelectronics_report.pdf |title = A Framework for Bioelectronics: Discovery and Innovation |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|pages =42|date =February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Sources for information about the field include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) with its [[Elsevier]] journal ''[[Biosensors and Bioelectronics]]'' published since 1990. The journal describes the scope of bioelectronics as seeking to : "... exploit biology in conjunction with electronics in a wider context encompassing, for example, biological fuel cells, bionics and biomaterials for information processing, information storage, electronic components and actuators. A key aspect is the interface between biological materials and micro- and nano-electronics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/405913/authorinstructions |title = Biosensors and Bioelectronics |publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Electronics technology has been applied to  biology and medicine since the [[pacemaker]] was invented and with the medical imaging industry. In 2009, a survey of publications using the term in title or abstract suggested that the center of activity was in Europe (43 percent), followed by Asia (23 percent) and the United States (20 percent).&lt;ref name=nist/&gt;{{rp|6}}

Organic bioelectronics is the application of [[Organic electronics|organic electronic]] material to the field of bioelectronics.

==Biography==
Angela Sibongile Makeba was born in South Africa in 1950, when her mother was 18 years old. The name Bongi by which she became known is a shortened version of her middle name Sibongile, which means "We are grateful".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miriammakeba.org/estate/bongi-makeba "Bongi Makeba"], Miriam Makeba Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 her mother's career took her to New York, where she remained in exile after being barred from returning to South Africa, and in 1960 was joined by Bongi, who stayed with friends while her mother toured the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lipstickalley.com/showthread.php/451583-The-Strength-of-a-Black-Woman-Miriam-Makeba-(Mama-Africa)-and-Apartheid-(long-read) "The Strength of a Black Woman: Miriam Makeba (Mama Africa) and Apartheid"], Lipstick Alley, 21 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberg&gt;Samantha Weinberg, [https://swco-ir.tdl.org/swco-ir/bitstream/handle/10605/4379/Southwest_Digest__1995-10-12.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Called Home: Children South African Exiles Return to Their Native Land"], ''Southwest Digest'', 12‚Äì18 October 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 she and Judy White, daughter of [[Josh White]], signed to [[Buddha Records]] as "Bongi and Judy", their first release being "Runnin' Out" and "Let's Get Together".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9ycEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22Bongi++makeba%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vCJQgaKy1N&amp;sig=GMsWepV4Oez9BC1btwwuizYy24A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA3e-txvnPAhXHCMAKHSXuAlU4MhDoAQgkMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bongi%20%20makeba%22&amp;f=false "Signings"], ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'', October 7, 1967, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 17, Makeba met her American husband Harold Nelson Lee, with whom in the early to mid-1970s she made two 7" records as "Bongi and Nelson", featuring two soul tracks arranged by George Butcher: "That's the Kind of Love" backed by "I Was So Glad" (France: Syliphone SYL 533), and "Everything, For My Love" with "Do You Remember, Malcolm?" (France: Syliphone SYL 532).&lt;ref name="discogs"/&gt; She recorded only one solo album, ''Bongi Makeba, Blow On Wind''&lt;ref name="discogs"&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Bongi+Makeba Bongi Makeba discography]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/Murtala-Bongi-Makeba-Blow-On-Wind/release/2024656 Murtala Bongi Makeba ‚Äì Blow On Wind]&lt;/ref&gt; (pl√§ne-records), in 1980. Some of her songs could be heard years later in her mother's repertoire. Two of them, "Malcolm X" (1965, 1972) and "Lumumba" (1970) extol assassinated black leaders.

Makeba had three children:&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7719318.stm "Obituary: Miriam 'Mama Africa' Makeba"], BBC News, 11 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson Lumumba Lee (born 1968), Zenzi Monique Lee (born 1971),&lt;ref name=Weinberg /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Phosa, [http://www.artlink.co.za/news_article.htm?contentID=10132 "Zenzi Lee"], ''The Star Tonight'', 5 January 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and a son, Themba, who died as a young child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Makeba|first= Miriam|date= 1992 |title= Miriam Makeba - Etel√§-Afrikan √§√§ni|trans-title=|url= |location= |publisher= Kirjayhtym√§|isbn= 951-26-3738-3|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nkrumah |first=Gamal |title=Mama Africa |work=Profile |date=1‚Äì7 November 2001 |issue=558 |publisher=''[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]'' |location=Cairo, Egypt |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/558/profile.htm |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jon |last=Pareles|authorlink=Jon Pareles |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/08/books/books-of-the-times-south-african-singer-s-life-trials-and-triumphs.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=Books of the Times; South African Singer's Life: Trials and Triumphs |work=Books |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=8 March 1988 |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Spalding Diving Bell, The Saturday Magazine, Vol. 14, 1839.png|right|thumb|230ps|Spalding's Diving Bell, ''The Saturday Magazine'', Vol. 14, 1839]]
'''Charles Spalding''' (29 October 1738 ‚Äì 2 June 1783) was an [[Edinburgh]] confectioner and amateur [[engineer]] who made improvements to the [[diving bell]]. He died while diving to the [[Shipwreck|wreck]] of the ''Belgioso'' in [[Dublin Bay]] using a diving bell of his own design.

==Early life==
Charles Spalding was born in [[Canongate]] in [[Scotland]] on 29 October 1738, the son of Charles Spalding and Ann Findlay.&lt;ref name="Charles Spalding Birth Record"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spalding|first=Charles|title=Old Parish Registers, Births &amp; Baptisms|date=29 October 1738|volume=685/03/0080/270}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a [[bookseller]] in Canongate.&lt;ref name="The Edinburgh Marriage Register" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Charles Spalding, Bookseller, Will 1786"&gt;{{cite book|title=Will of Charles Spalding, Bookseller|date=25 January 1786|location=Edinburgh, Scotland Commissary Court|edition=Reference CC8/8/127}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the son of a [[merchant]], the younger Spalding eventually became a shop-lad.&lt;ref name="The Technical Educator" /&gt;

Possessing a natural inclination towards [[mechanics]], Spalding spent much of his free time as a youth exploring this interest.&lt;ref name="The Technical Educator" /&gt; Spalding eventually became the proprietor of a [[sugar refinery|sugar refining]] and [[Confectionery store|confectionery shop]] across from the [[Edinburgh City Chambers|Royal Exchange]] on the [[Royal Mile]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="The Technical Educator"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Technical Educator, An Encyclop√¶dia|year=1871|publisher=Cassell, Petter, and Galpin|location=London, Paris, New York|pages=29‚Äì31|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ky4CAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA30&amp;dq=%22ebenezer+watson%22+edinburgh#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ebenezer%20watson%22%20edinburgh&amp;f=false|edition=Volume III}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas Tegg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tegg|first=Thomas|title=London Encyclopaedia; Or, Universal Dictionary of Science, Art, Literature &amp; Practical Mechanics|year=1829|location=London, England|pages=716|edition=Volume XX}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The London Encyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Curtis|first=Thomas|title=The London Encyclopaedia|year=1829|location=London, England|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dHVMAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA716&amp;dq=%22royal+exchange%22+edinburgh+spalding#v=onepage&amp;q=%22royal%20exchange%22%20edinburgh%20spalding&amp;f=false|edition=Volume XX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improvements to Halley's diving bell==
Spalding's introduction to diving was more the result of necessity than choice.  Heavily invested in the [[brig]] ''Peggy'', Spalding suffered a severe financial blow when she sank ''en route'' to Scotland at the [[Farne Islands]]&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bevan|first=Dr. John|title=Paper:  Charles Spalding's Diving Bells|journal=Presented to a meeting of the Historical Diving Society at Norwegian Underwater Institute, Bergen|date=5 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 4 December 1774.&lt;ref name="Society of Arts" /&gt; Elected by his Edinburgh trade [[guild]] to recover as many goods as possible, Spalding came up with the idea of diving to the wreck.&lt;ref name="Society of Arts" /&gt;

The prevailing diving bell design in 1775 was that of Dr. [[Edmond Halley]] (1656‚Äì1742), who had computed the orbit of the [[Halley's Comet|comet]] named for him.&lt;ref name="Society of Arts" /&gt; Using his background in mechanics, Spalding read every book he could find on the design of Halley's diving bell, eventually proceeding to trial dives in the port of [[Leith]], [[Dunbar]] Bay and at [[Dundee]].&lt;ref name="Society of Arts" /&gt; Based on these trials, Spalding determined that Halley's design had weaknesses that added unnecessary risk to the divers.&lt;ref name="The Saturday Magazine" /&gt; To correct the deficiencies, Spalding added a system of balance-weights to ease the raising and lowering of the bell, along with a series of ropes for signalling the surface crew.&lt;ref name="Dublin A Cultural History" /&gt; The redesigned diving bell weighed {{convert|200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and could accommodate two divers.&lt;ref name="Dublin A Cultural History" /&gt; Spalding also added ropes inside in the bell as seats and thick glass windows to admit light.&lt;ref name="The Technical Educator" /&gt;

Spalding never recovered any of his own cargo from the wreck of the ''Peggy''.&lt;ref name="Society of Arts" /&gt; However, in 1776 Spalding was recognised by The Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, London, with a nominal monetary award for his modified diving bell design.&lt;ref name="Society of Arts"&gt;{{cite book|title=Transactions of the Society Instituted at London for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce|year=1806|publisher=Society of Arts|location=Great Britain|pages=220‚Äì232|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zxtbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=%22charles+spalding%22+edinburgh#v=onepage&amp;q=%22charles%20spalding%22%20edinburgh&amp;f=false|edition=The Third Edition, Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Saturday Magazine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parker|first=John William|title=The Saturday Magazine|year=1839|publisher=Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (Great Britain)|location=London|pages=199‚Äì200|edition=Volume 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this success, Spalding founded ''Spalding &amp; Co.'' of Edinburgh for his diving operations.&lt;ref name="Dublin A Cultural History"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kilfeather|first=Siobh√°n|title=Dublin : a cultural history|year=2005|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=9780195182019|pages=63‚Äì65|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8QWZRVAPa6sC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=%22Charles+spalding%22+%22royal+george%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Charles%20spalding%22%20%22royal%20george%22&amp;f=false|edition=2nd ed., 113 th impression.|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spalding was assisted in his diving efforts by his brother Thomas (b. 1740), George Small, who was married to Spalding's sister Ann, and his nephew, Ebenezer Watson.&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt;

== HMS ''Royal George''==
[[File:Sinking of Royal George 1782.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Sinking of {{HMS|Royal George|1756|6}} at Spithead, 1782]]
On 29 August 1782, the warship {{HMS|Royal George|1756|6}} [[capsizing|capsized]] while under repairs and sank off [[Spithead]], near the port of [[Portsmouth]].&lt;ref name="Treasure Hunt" /&gt; HMS ''Royal George'' was the pride of [[King George III]]'s navy and one of the last British [[Man-of-war]] to be primarily outfitted with more expensive [[brass]] guns rather than lead.&lt;ref name="Treasure Hunt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Earle|first=Peter|title=Treasure Hunt: Shipwreck, Diving, and the Quest for Treasure in an Age of Heroes|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York City|pages=256|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZchD115mtg4C&amp;pg=PA256&amp;dq=%22thomas+spalding%22+%22royal+george%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22thomas%20spalding%22%20%22royal%20george%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 January 2013|isbn=9780312380397}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[weapons|ordnance]] alone was valued at ¬£17,000.&lt;ref name="Treasure Hunt" /&gt;

One of the first people on the scene with a diving background was Thomas Spalding, Charles' brother.&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt; As a surgeon on an [[East Indiaman]], Thomas happened to be in Portsmouth shortly after the sinking occurred.&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt; He immediately proposed to the [[Admiralty]] that he and his brother should be allowed to recover as much valuable stores and ordnance from the wreck as possible using his brother's diving bell design.&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt; The terms of the salvage arrangement were that Spalding would receive one-third of everything he recovered.&lt;ref name="The Technical Educator" /&gt;

Thomas Spalding initially completed several [[reconnaissance]] dives before Charles arrived at the site on 2 October 1782 to begin diving.&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt; Charles worked on the wreck through most of October 1782 until the beginning of November.&lt;ref name="Treasure Hunt" /&gt; Spalding's dives were complicated by weather, the inexperience of the crew in working with the bell, and the amount of [[debris]] at the dive site.&lt;ref name="Treasure Hunt" /&gt; Overall, Spalding raised 15 guns from the wreck, 9 brass and 6 lead.&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt; Spalding's proceeds from his salvage of HMS ''Royal George'' were approximately ¬£400.&lt;ref name="The Technical Educator" /&gt; Spalding later learned that the Admiralty had awarded William Tracey of [[Portsea, Portsmouth]] the [[salvage rights]] to the wreck for the following spring.&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt;

==The ''Belgioso''==
[[File:Charles Spalding Diving Bell, The Pictorial Gallery of Arts, London Printing and Publishing, 1860.jpg|thumb|right|Charles Spalding Diving Bell, c. 1860]]
Undeterred, Spalding turned his attention to the wreck of the ''Belgioso''.

In March 1783, the ''Belgioso'' or ''Count de Belgioso'' Imperial East Indiaman was sailing from [[Liverpool]] ''en route'' to China when it sank in a storm at [[Kish Bank]] near [[Dublin Bay]] in the [[Irish Sea]].&lt;ref name="Irish Wrecks Database"&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Wrecks Database|url=http://www.irishwrecks.com/About.aspx|accessdate=19 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001094701/http://irishwrecks.com/About.aspx|archivedate=1 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cargo of the ''Belgioso'' was valued at ¬£150,000, with ¬£30,000 in silver and lead.&lt;ref name="The Technical Educator" /&gt; The salvage terms agreed to by the owners were that Spalding would keep one-fourth of all silver and lead recovered and one-half of all other cargo.&lt;ref name="The Technical Educator" /&gt; Additionally, if Spalding failed to recover anything, his entire expense for the operation would be defrayed.&lt;ref name="The Technical Educator" /&gt;

Spalding and his nephew, Ebenezer Watson, arrived in Dublin in May 1783 to begin their dive preparations.&lt;ref name="The Technical Educator" /&gt; On 1 June 1783 they began their dives, making three dives to {{convert|7|fathom|ft|lk=in}} to the wreck.&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt; Typical for the start of a new project, the three dives were plagued with issues.&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt;

On the morning of 2 June 1783, Spalding and Watson resumed diving.&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt; Approximately one hour and fifteen minutes had elapsed when the dive crew became concerned.&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt; Two to three barrels of air had been sent down with no progress signal from the bell.&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt; Since the dive time was longer than usual, the dive crew proceeded to lift the bell.&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt; When the bell broke the surface they found both men dead, "Mr. Spalding reclining on his breast over one of the ropes that was stretched across for the purpose of sitting upon, and Mr. Watson sitting erect in the upper part of the bell".&lt;ref name="The Technical Educator" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Scots Magazine" /&gt;

On Sunday morning, 8 June 1783, Charles Spalding and Ebenezer Watson were laid to rest.&lt;ref name="The Scots Magazine" /&gt; The Irish press had chronicled Spalding's activity at the ''Belgioso'' wreck site, and Spalding had become somewhat of a local celebrity with the Irish citizens.&lt;ref name="The Technical Educator" /&gt; Many influential Dublin citizens attended the funeral.&lt;ref name="The Technical Educator" /&gt; In a tribute to Spalding's memory, the ships in Dublin Bay kept their flags lowered until the interment was completed.&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Hiberian Magazine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Potts|first=James|title=The Hibernian Magazine, Or, Compendium of Entertaining Knowledge|year=1783|publisher=Thomas Walker|location=Dublin, Ireland|pages=333‚Äì335|url=https://books.google.com/?id=w7IRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA334&amp;dq=spalding+confectioner#v=onepage&amp;q=spalding%20confectioner&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair were buried in a single grave in [[St. Mark's Church, Dublin|St. Mark's Churchyard]] in Dublin.&lt;ref name="The Scots Magazine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boswell|first=James|title=The Scots Magazine|date=January 1783|publisher=Sands, Brymer, Murray and Cochran|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|pages=324‚Äì325|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Tt8RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=%22charles+spalding%22+%22ebenezer+watson%22|edition=Volume 45|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact location of their grave within the churchyard is unknown.&lt;ref name="The National Maritime Museum of Ireland"&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Maritime Museum of Ireland|url=http://www.mariner.ie/history/articles/engineering/historical-diving|accessdate=19 January 2013|author=Dr. Edward J.

An [[inquest]] into Spalding's and Watson's deaths was eventually held.  The causes reviewed during the hearings varied from the negligence of the dive ship's captain, equipment failure, including tangled signal ropes or the failure of the final cask of air reaching the divers, diver error, putrified air from the rotting cargo of the ''Belgioso'', even [[sabotage]] and alcohol.&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Wrecks Database" /&gt; Dive experts today think the most plausible explanation is "a highly noxious ''effluvia'' entering the bell which could have come from the [[decomposition|putrifying]] bodies or even the rotting cargo of [[ginseng]] plants in the [[Hold (ship)|cargo hold]]."&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt; This theory is consistent with the observation that they made no apparent attempt to make an emergency ascent.&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt; The exact cause of death of Spalding and Watson is unknown.&lt;ref name="Dr. John Bevan Paper" /&gt;

On 14 August 1768, Spalding married Susan Small, the daughter of [[James Small (Scottish factor)|James Small]], [[Factor (Scotland)|factor]] of [[Asset forfeiture|forfeited]] Struan estates in [[Perthshire]], Scotland.&lt;ref name="The Edinburgh Marriage Register"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant, W.S.|first=Francis J.|title=The Edinburgh Marriage Register, 1751 ‚Äì 1800|year=1922|publisher=J.

'''Civil liberties''' or '''personal freedoms''' are personal guarantees and freedoms that the [[government]] cannot abridge, either by law or by [[judicial interpretation]], without due process. Though the scope of the term differs between countries, civil liberties may include the [[freedom of conscience]], [[freedom of press]], [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of expression]], [[freedom of assembly]], the right to security and [[liberty]], [[freedom of speech]], the [[right to privacy]], the right to [[legal equality|equal treatment under the law]] and [[due process]], the [[right to a fair trial]], and the [[right to life]]. Other civil liberties include the [[property rights|right to own property]], the [[self-defence|right to defend oneself]], and the right to [[bodily integrity]]. Within the distinctions between civil liberties and other types of liberty, distinctions exist between [[positive liberty]]/[[positive rights]] and [[negative liberty]]/[[negative rights]].

==Overview==
[[File:Li-ber-ty.jpg|thumb| upright|Broken Liberty: [[Istanbul]] Archaeology Museum]]
Many contemporary states have a [[constitution]], a [[bill of rights]], or similar constitutional documents that enumerate and seek to guarantee civil liberties. Other states have enacted similar laws through a variety of legal means, including signing and ratifying or otherwise giving effect to key conventions such as the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. The existence of some claimed civil liberties is a matter of dispute, as are the extent of most [[civil rights]]. Controversial examples include [[property rights]], [[reproductive rights]], and [[civil marriage]]. The degree that democracies have involved themselves in needs to take into fact the influence of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Lance Y.|date=2015-09-18|title=Terrorism, Civil Liberties, and Political Rights: A Cross-National Analysis|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F1057610X.2015.1084165|journal=Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism|language=en|volume=39|issue=2|pages=165‚Äì193|doi=10.1080/1057610x.2015.1084165|issn=1057-610X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the existence of [[victimless crime]]s infringes upon civil liberties is a matter of dispute. Another matter of debate is the suspension or alteration of certain civil liberties in times of [[war]] or [[state of emergency]], including whether and to what extent this should occur.

The formal concept of civil liberties is often dated back to [[Magna Carta]], an English legal [[charter]] agreed in 1215 which in turn was based on pre-existing documents, namely the [[Charter of Liberties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hugh Starkey, Professor of Citizenship and Human Rights Education at UCL Institute of Education, London|title=Magna Carta and Human rights legislation|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/human-rights-legislation|publisher=British Library|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==

===China===
{{main article|Civil liberties in the People's Republic of China}}
The [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|Constitution of People's Republic of China]] (which applies only to [[mainland China]], not to [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]]), especially its Fundamental Rights and Duties of Citizens, claims to protect many civil liberties.
Taiwan, which is separated from China, has its own Constitution.

===India===
{{Main article|Fundamental Rights in India}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Nehru signing Indian Constitution.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jawaharlal Nehru]] signing the [[Constitution of India]] on 24 January 1950]] --&gt;
&lt;!-- FAIR USE of Image:Nehru signing Indian Constitution.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Nehru signing Indian Constitution.jpg for rationale --&gt;
The Fundamental Rights‚Äîembodied in Part III of the constitution‚Äîguarantee  liberties such that all Indians can lead their lives in peace as citizens of India. The six fundamental rights are right to equality, right to freedom, right against exploitation, right to freedom of religion, cultural and educational rights and right to constitutional remedies.&lt;ref name=constpartIII&gt;[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part III|Constitution of India-Part III Fundamental Rights]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dyfikolkata (54).jpg|thumb|left|Huge rallies like this one in [[Kolkata]] are commonplace in [[India]].]]
These include individual rights common to most [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], incorporated in the fundamental law of the land and are enforceable in a court of law. Violations of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the [[Indian Penal Code]], subject to discretion of the [[judiciary]]. These rights are neither absolute nor immune from constitutional amendments. They have been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they resulted in abolishment of un-touchability and prohibit [[discrimination]] on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They forbid [[human trafficking]] and [[unfree labour]]. They protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious [[minorities]] by allowing them to preserve their languages and administer their own educational institutions.

All people, irrespective of race, religion, caste or sex, have the right to approach the [[High Courts of India|High Courts]] or the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] for the enforcement of their fundamental rights. It is not necessary that the aggrieved party has to be the one to do so. In public interest, anyone can initiate litigation in the court on their behalf. This is known as "[[Public interest litigation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} This was the case where [[public interest litigation]] was introduced (date of ruling 15 December 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; High Court and Supreme Court judges can also act on their own on the basis of media reports.

The Fundamental Rights emphasize equality by guaranteeing to all citizens the access and use of public institutions and protections, irrespective of their background. The rights to life and personal liberty apply for persons of any nationality, while others, such as the freedom of speech and expression are applicable only to the [[Indian nationality law|citizens of India]] (including [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|non-resident Indian]] citizens).&lt;ref&gt;Tayal, B.B. &amp; Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', p. A-25&lt;/ref&gt; The right to equality in matters of public employment cannot be conferred to [[Indian nationality law#Overseas citizenship of India|overseas citizens of India]].&lt;ref name="OCI"&gt;{{cite web

Fundamental Rights primarily protect individuals from any arbitrary State actions, but some rights are enforceable against private individuals too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} This was the case where Fundamental Rights were enforced against private individuals (date of ruling 15 December 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the constitution abolishes untouchability and prohibits ''[[Unfree labour|begar]]''. These provisions act as a check both on State action and actions of private individuals. Fundamental Rights are not absolute and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of national interest. In the [[Basic structure#Kesavananda|''Kesavananda Bharati vs. state of Kerala'' case]], the Supreme Court ruled that all provisions of the constitution, including Fundamental Rights can be amended.&lt;ref&gt;[[Basic structure#Kesavananda|''Kesavananda Bharati vs. state of Kerala''; AIR 1973 S.C. 1461, (1973) 4 SCC 225]] ‚Äì In what became famously known as the "Fundamental Rights case", the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] decided that the basic structure of the constitution was unamendable.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Parliament cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution like secularism, democracy, federalism, separation of powers. Often called the "Basic structure doctrine", this decision is widely regarded as an important part of Indian history. In the 1978 ''[[Maneka Gandhi]] v. Union of India'' case, the Supreme Court extended the doctrine's importance as superior to any parliamentary legislation.According to the verdict, no act of parliament can be considered a law if it violated the basic structure of the constitution. This landmark guarantee of Fundamental Rights was regarded as a unique example of judicial independence in preserving the sanctity of Fundamental Rights.
The Fundamental Rights can only be altered by a constitutional amendment, hence their inclusion is a check not only on the executive branch, but also on the Parliament and state legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;Tayal, B.B. &amp; Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', p. A-24&lt;/ref&gt; The imposition of a [[State of Emergency in India|state of emergency]] may lead to a temporary suspension of the rights conferred by Article 19 (including freedoms of speech, assembly and movement, etc.) to preserve national security and public order. The [[President]] can, by order, suspend the constitutional written remedies as well.

===Japan===
{{Main article|Human rights in Japan}}
Since 1947, [[Japan]], a country with a [[constitutional monarchy]] and known for its socially ‚Äúconservative society where change is gradual,‚Äù has a [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] with a seemingly strong bill of rights at its core ([[:wikisource: Constitution of Japan#CHAPTER III. RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PEOPLE|Chapter III. Rights and Duties of the People]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvL8d8RH-Z8C&amp;pg=PT225&amp;dq=Japan+conservative+society+where+change+is+gradual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRjtG70tvNAhVE5oMKHcnhBxQQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Japan%20conservative%20society%20where%20change%20is%20gradual&amp;f=false | title=apan: A Global Studies Handbook | publisher=ABC-CLIO | author=Ellington, Lucien | year=2002 | location=Santa Barbara, CA | page=209 | isbn=1576072711}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, it resembles the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] prior to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], and that is because it came into life during the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[occupation of Japan]].  This constitution may have felt like a foreign imposition to the governing elites, but not to the ordinary people "who lacked faith in their discredited leaders and supported meaningful change."&lt;ref&gt;Law, David S., The Myth of the Imposed Constitution (May 26, 2013).

Available at SSRN:http://ssrn.com/abstract=2270399&lt;/ref&gt;  In the abstract, the constitution strives to secure fundamental individual liberties and rights, which are covered pointedly in articles 10 to 40.  Most salient of the human dignity articles is article 25, section 1, which guarantees that all [[:wikisource: Constitution of Japan#CHAPTER III.

Despite, the adoption of this liberal constitution, often referred as the "Postwar Constitution" (Êà¶ÂæåÊÜ≤Ê≥ï, Sengo-Kenp≈ç) or the "Peace Constitution" (Âπ≥ÂíåÊÜ≤Ê≥ï, Heiwa-Kenp≈ç), the Japanese governing elites have struggled to usher in an inclusive, open and [[Pluralist society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-HODTsc7LsC | title=Building Democracy in Japan | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Haddad,  Mary Alice | year=2012 | location=Cambridge, UK | page=59 | isbn=1107014077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the end of [[World War II]] and the departure of the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers#End of SCAP|Allied government of occupation]] in 1952, Japan has been the target of international criticism for failing to admit to [[war crimes]], [[Freedom of religion|institutional religious discrimination]] and maintaining a weak [[freedom of the press]], the treatment of children, minorities, foreigners, and women, its punitive criminal justice system, and more recently, the systematic bias against [[LGBT]] people.&lt;ref name="Japan veering away"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/02/25/national/japan-veering-away-from-global-human-rights-standards-says-amnesty-international/ | title=Japan veering away from global human rights standards, says Amnesty International | work=[[The Japan Times]] | date=February 25, 2015 | accessdate=July 5, 2016 | agency=[[Kyodo News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Japan LGBT Discrimination"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.outrightinternational.org/content/un-urges-end-discrimination-against-lgbt-individuals-japan | title=UN Urges End to Discrimination Against LGBT Individuals in Japan | publisher=Outright International | work=Analysis | date=July 25, 2014 | accessdate=July 5, 2016 |author1=Suzanne Trimel }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/06/26/national/u-s-rights-report-slams-japan-on-child-abuse-prison-conditions-asylum-system/#.V3sEBJMrJE6 | title=U.S. rights report slams Japan on child abuse, prison conditions, asylum system | work=News report | date=June 26, 2015 | agency=Japan Times | accessdate=July 5, 2016 | author=Osumi, Magdalena}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The first Japanese attempt to a bill of rights was in the 19th century [[Meiji constitution]] (1890), which took both the [[Constitution of Prussia (1850)|Prussian]] (1850) and [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British]] constitutions as basic models.&lt;ref&gt;Kazuhiro Takii and David Noble, The Meiji Constitution: The Japanese Experience of the West and the Shaping of the Modern State (Tokyo, Japan: International House of Japan, 2007), 181.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it had but a meager influence in the practice of the rule of law as well as in people‚Äôs daily living.  So, the short and deliberately gradual history of struggles for personal rights and protection against government/society's impositions has yet to transform Japan into a champion of universal and individual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gordon, ''Postwar Japan As History''.

London: Routledge, 2013, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; According to constitutional scholar, Shigenori Matsui,

{{Quote|text= People tend to view the bill of rights as a moral imperative and not as a judicial norm. The people also tend to rely upon bureaucrats to remedy social problems, including even human rights violations, rather than the court.|author= Shigenori Matsui | source=‚ÄúThe protection of ‚ÄòFundamental human rights‚Äô in Japan.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;‚ÄúThe protection of ‚ÄòFundamental human rights‚Äô in Japan,‚Äù a chapter in Human Rights in Asia: A Comparative Legal Study of Twelve Asian Jurisdictions, France and the USA, edited by Peerenboom, R. P., Carole Petersen, and Hongyi Chen (London: Routledge, 2006), 149&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite the divergences between Japan's social culture and the [[Constitutional liberalism|Liberal Constitutionalism]] that it purports to have adopted, the country has moved toward closing the gap between the notion and the practice of the law. The trend is more evident in the long term. Among several examples, the [[National Diet|Diet]] (bicameral legislature) ratified the [[International Bill of Human Rights]] in 1979 and then it passed the Law for Equal Opportunity in Employment for Men and Women in 1985, measures that were heralded as major steps toward a democratic and participatory society.  In 2015, moreover, it reached an agreement with [[Korea]] to compensate for abuses related to the so-called ‚Äú[[Comfort women|women of comfort]]‚Äù that took place during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]] of the [[Korean Peninsula|peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35188135 | title=Japan and South Korea agree WW2 'comfort women' deal | date=December 28, 2015 | agency=BBC | accessdate=July 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, human rights group, and families of the survivors condemned the agreement as patronizing and insulting.&lt;ref name=" horrific story of Korea's 'comfort women' "&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/the-horrific-story-of-koreas-comfort-women---forced-to-be-sex-sl/ | title=The horrific story of Korea's 'comfort women' - forced to be sex slaves during World War Two | work=Telegraph | date=December 29, 2015 | accessdate=July 5, 2016 | author=Sanghani, Radhika | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On its official [http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/HB/hb-03.html site], the Japanese government has identified various human rights problems. Among these are child abuses (e.g., [[bullying]], [[corporal punishment]], [[child sexual abuse]], [[child prostitution]], and [[child pornography]]), frequent neglect and ill-treatment of [[Elder abuse|elderly persons]] and individuals with [[Disability abuse|disabilities]], [[Burakumin#Discrimination in access to services|Dowa claims]] (discrimination against the [[Burakumin]]), [[Ainu people]] (indigenous people in Japan), foreign nationals, [[HIV/AIDS in Japan|HIV/AIDS carriers]], [[Hansen's disease]] patients, persons released from prison after serving their sentence, [[Victims' rights|crime victims]], people whose [[Human rights#Information and communication technologies|human rights are violated using the Internet]], the homeless, individuals with [[Gender dysphoria|
identity disorders]], and [[Misogyny|women]]. Also, the government lists systematic problems with gender biases and the standard reference to sexual preferences for jobs and other functions in society.&lt;ref name="Major problems"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/HB/hb-03.html | title=Major Human Rights Problems | publisher=Ministry of Justice, Japan | work=Human Rights Bureau | date=March 6, 2009  | accessdate=July 5, 2016 | author=Government of Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights organizations, national and foreign, expand the list to include human rights violations that relate to government policies, as in the case of [[daiyo kangoku]] system (substitute prison) and the methods of interrogating crime suspects.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Flynn,  Reframing the Intercultural Dialogue on Human Rights: A Philosophical Approach (London: Routledge, 2014), 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The effort of these agencies and ordinary people seem to pay off. In 2016, the U.S. Department of State released a report stating that Japan's human right record is showing signs of improvement.&lt;ref name=" human rights improve but problems persist"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/04/14/national/social-issues/japan-human-rights-improve-problems-persist-u-s-state-department/#.V3tLxZMrKRs | title=Japan human rights improve but problems persist: U.S. State Department | work=Japan Times  | date=April 14, 2016 | accessdate=July 5, 2016 | author=Wanklyn, Alastair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
Although Australia does not have an enshrined Bill of Rights or similar binding legal document, civil liberties are assumed as protected through a series of rules and conventions. Australia was a key player and signatory to the UN Universal Declaration on Human Rights (1948)

The [[Constitution of Australia]] (1900) does offer very limited protection of rights:
* the right to freedom of religion and;
* the right to freedom from discrimination based on out-of-state residence (historical prejudice based upon residence within one state affecting treatment within another)
Certain High Court interpretations of the Constitution have allowed for implied rights such as freedom of speech and the right to vote to be established, however others such as freedom of assembly and freedom of association are yet to be identified.

'''Refugee issues'''

Within the past decade Australia has experienced increasing contention regarding its treatment of those seeking asylum. Although Australia is a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention (1951), successive governments have demonstrated an increasing tightening of borders; particularly against those who seek passage via small water vessels.

The Abbott Government (2013) like its predecessors (the Gillard and Howard Governments) has encountered particular difficulty curbing asylum seekers via sea, increasingly identified as "illegal immigration". The recent involvement of the Australian Navy in refugee rescue operations has many human rights groups such as Amnesty International concerned over the "militarisation" of treatment of refugees. The current "turn-back" policy is particularly divisive, as it involves placing refugees in government lifeboats and turning them towards Indonesia. Despite opposition however, the Abbott government's response has so far seen a reduction in the amount of potential refugees undertaking the hazardous cross to Australia, which is argued by the government as an indicator for its policy success.

==Europe==

===European Convention on Human Rights===
The [[European Convention on Human Rights]], to which almost all European countries belong (apart from [[Belarus]]), enumerates a number of civil liberties and is of varying constitutional force in different European states.

===Czech Republic===
Following the [[Velvet Revolution]], a constitutional overhaul took place in [[Czech and Slovak Federal Republic|Czechoslovakia]]. In 1991, the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms]] was adopted, having the same legal standing as the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Constitution]]. The Czech Republic has kept the Charter in its entirety following the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] as Act No. 2/1993 Coll. (Constitution being No. 1).

===France===
France's 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] listed many civil liberties and is of constitutional force.

===Germany===
The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]], the "Grundgesetz" (lit. "Base Law"), starts with an elaborate listing of civil liberties and states in sec. 1 "The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all public authority." Following the "[[Austrian System]]", the people have the right to appeal to the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] ("Bundesverfassungsgericht") if they feel their civil rights are being violated. This procedure has shaped German law considerably over the years.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Civil liberties in the United Kingdom}}
Civil liberties in the [[United Kingdom]] date back to [[Magna Carta]] in 1215 and 17th century [[English common law|common law]] and [[statute law]], such as the 1628 [[Petition of Right]], the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]] and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]]. Parts of these laws remain in statute today and are supplemented by other legislation and conventions that collectively form the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]]. In addition, the United Kingdom is a signatory to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] which covers both [[human rights]] and civil liberties. The [[Human Rights Act 1998]] incorporates the great majority of Convention rights directly into UK law.

In June 2008 the then Shadow Home Secretary [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] [[David Davis by-election campaign, 2008|resigned his parliamentary seat]] over what he described as the "erosion of civil liberties" by the then Labour government, and was re-elected on a civil liberties platform (although he was not opposed by candidates of other major parties). This was in reference to anti-terrorism laws and in particular the extension to pre-trial detention, that is perceived by many to be an infringement of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' established in Magna Carta.

===Russia===
The [[Constitution of Russia|Constitution of the Russian Federation]] guarantees in theory many of the same rights and civil liberties as the U.S. except to [[bear arms]], i.e.: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association and assembly, freedom to choose language, to due process, to a fair trial, privacy, freedom to vote, right for education, etc. However, human rights groups like [[Amnesty International]] have warned that [[Vladimir Putin]] has seriously curtailed [[freedom of expression]], [[freedom of assembly]] and [[freedom of association]] amidst growing authoritarianism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/27/russia.humanrights Putin rolling back civil rights, warns Amnesty | World news | The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==

===Canada===
The [[Constitution of Canada]] includes the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] which guarantees many of the same rights as the U.S. constitution, with the notable exceptions of protection against [[establishment of religion]]. However, the Charter does protect [[freedom of religion]]. The Charter also omits any mention of, or protection for, property.

===United States===
{{main article|Civil liberties in the United States}}
The [[United States Constitution]], especially its [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], protects civil liberties. The passage of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] further protected civil liberties by introducing the [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]], [[Due Process Clause]], and [[Equal Protection Clause]]. Human rights within the United States are often called [[civil rights]], which are those rights, privileges and immunities held by all people, in distinction to ''political'' rights, which are the rights that inhere to those who are entitled to participate in elections, as candidates or voters.&lt;ref&gt;America's Constitution: A Biography by Akhil Reed Amar&lt;/ref&gt; Before universal suffrage, this distinction was important, since many people were ineligible to vote but still were considered to have the fundamental freedoms derived from the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This distinction is less important now that Americans enjoy near [[universal suffrage]], and civil liberties are now taken to include the political rights to vote and participate in elections.  Because Indian tribal governments retain sovereignty over tribal members, the U.S. Congress in 1968 enacted a law that essentially applies most of the protections of the Bill of Rights to tribal members, to be enforced mainly by tribal courts.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. McCarthy, Civil Rights in Tribal Courts; The Indian Bill of Rights at 30 Years, 34 IDAHO LAW REVIEW 465 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civil Liberties Act of 1988 was signed into effect by President Ronald Reagan on August 10, 1988. The act was passed by Congress to issue a public apology for those of Japanese ancestry who lost their property and liberty due to discriminatory actions by the United States Government during the internment period.

This act also provided many other benefits within various sectors of the government. Within the treasury it establishes a civil liberties public education fund. It directs the Attorney General to identify and locate each individual affected by this act and to pay them $20,000 from the civil liberties public education fund. It also established a board of directors who is responsible for making disbursements from this fund. Finally, it requires that all documents and records that are created or received by the commission be kept in the United States archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foley|first1=Thomas|title=Civil Liberties Act of 1987 - Conference Report|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/house-bill/442|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cognitive computer''' combines [[artificial intelligence]] and machine-learning algorithms, in an approach which attempts to reproduce the behaviour of the human brain.&lt;ref name="modha-ns1"&gt;Dharmendra Modha (interview), "A computer that thinks", ''New Scientist'' 8 November 2014, Pages 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of [[neural network]] implementations of cognitive convolution and [[deep learning]] is provided by the [[IBM]] company's [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] machine. A subsequent development by IBM is the [[TrueNorth]] microchip architecture, which is designed to be closer in structure to the human brain than the [[von Neumann architecture]] used in conventional computers.&lt;ref name="modha-ns1" /&gt; In 2017 [[Intel]] announced its own version of a cognitive chip in "Loihi", which will be available to university and research labs in 2018.

==Intel Loihi chip==
Intel's self-learning neuromorphic chip, named Loihi, perhaps named after the Hawaiian seamount [[Loihi]], offers substantial power efficiency designed after the human brain. Intel claims Loihi is about 1000 times more energy efficient than the general-purpose computing power needed to train the neural networks that rival Loihi‚Äôs performance. 
In theory, this would support both machine learning training and inference on the same silicon independently of a cloud connection, and more efficient than using [[convolutional neural network]]s (CNNs) or [[deep learning]] [[neural network]]s. Intel points to a system for monitoring a person‚Äôs heartbeat, taking readings after events such as exercise or eating, and uses the cognitive computing chip to normalize the data and work out the ‚Äònormal‚Äô heartbeat. It can then spot abnormalities, but also deal with any new events or conditions.
{{pov-section|date=March 2018}}
The first iteration of the Loihi chip was made using Intel‚Äôs 14&amp;nbsp;nm fabrication process, and houses 128 clusters of 1,024 artificial neurons each for a total of 131,072 simulated neurons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/article/why-intel-built-a-neuromorphic-chip/ "Why Intel built a neuromorphic chip". September 29, 2017. www.ZDNet.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This offers around 130 million synapses, which is still a rather long way from the human brain's 800 trillion synapses, and behind IBM‚Äôs [[TrueNorth]], which has around 16 billion by using  64 by 4,096 cores.&lt;ref&gt;[https://aitrends.com/future-of-ai/intel-unveils-loihi-neuromorphic/ "Intel unveils Loihi neuromorphic chip, chases IBM in artificial brains". October 17, 2017. AITrends.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==IBM TrueNorth Chip==
{{main|TrueNorth}}
The IBM cognitive computers implement learning using [[Hebbian theory]].  Instead of being programmable in a traditional sense within [[machine language]] or a higher level [[programming language]] such a device learns by inputting instances through an [[input device]] that are aggregated within a computational [[convolution]] or [[neural network]] architecture consisting of weights within a parallel memory system.  An early instantiation of such a device has been developed in 2012 under the [[Darpa]] [[SyNAPSE]] program at IBM directed by [[Dharmendra Modha]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014|reason=not detailed in the cited source}}

In 2017 this IBM 64-chip [[array data structure|array]] will contain the processing equivalent of 64 million neurons and 16 billion synapses, yet  each processor consumes just 10 watts of electricity.
Like other neural networks, this system will be put to use in pattern recognition and sensory processing roles. The Air Force wants to combine the [[TrueNorth]] ability to convert multiple data feeds &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;whether it's audio, video or text&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; into machine readable symbols with a conventional supercomputer's ability to crunch data.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
This isn't the first time that IBM's neural chip system has been integrated into cutting-edge technology. August, 2017 [[Samsung]] installed the chips in its Dynamic Vision Sensors enabling cameras to capture images at up to 2,000 fps while using just 300 milliwatts of power.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Criticism==
There are many approaches and definitions for a '''cognitive computer''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schank|first1=Roger C.|last2=Childers|first2=Peter G.|title=The cognitive computer: on language, learning, and artificial intelligence|publisher=Addison-Wesley Pub.

Specifically, there are critics who argue that a room-sized computer - like the case of Watson - is not a viable alternative to a three-pound human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metaskills: Five Talents for the Robotic Age|last=Neumeier|first=Marty|publisher=New Riders|year=2012|isbn=9780133359329|location=Indianapolis, IN|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also cite the difficulty for a single system to bring so many elements together such as the disparate sources of information as well as computing resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cognitive Computing and Big Data Analytics|last=Hurwitz|first=Judith|last2=Kaufman|first2=Marcia|last3=Bowles|first3=Adrian|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2015|isbn=9781118896624|location=Indianapolis, IN|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2018 [[World Economic Forum]], there are experts who claim that cognitive systems could adopt the biases of their developers and this was demonstrated in the case of the [[Google]] [[Computer vision|image-recognition]] or computer vision algorithm, which identified [[African Americans]] unfavorably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/18/world-economic-forum-ai-has-a-bias-problem-that-needs-to-be-fixed.html|title=A.I. has a bias problem that needs to be fixed: World Economic Forum|last=Choudhury|first=Saheli Roy|date=2018-09-18|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Coupling in molecules}}

In [[physics]], &lt;dfn&gt;two objects are said &lt;/dfn&gt;to be coupled when they are interacting with each other. In [[classical mechanics]], coupling is a connection between two [[Oscillation|oscillating]] systems, such as [[pendulum]]s connected by a string. The connection affects the oscillatory pattern of both objects. In [[particle physics]], &lt;dfn&gt;two particles are coupled &lt;/dfn&gt;if they are connected by &lt;dfn&gt;one of the four &lt;/dfn&gt;[[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]].

==Wave mechanics==

=== Coupled harmonic oscillator ===
[[File:Coupled.svg|thumb|Coupled pendulums connected by a spring]]
If two [[Waves (physics)|waves]] are able to transmit [[energy]] to each other, then these waves are said to be "coupled." This normally occurs when the waves share a common component. An example of this is two pendulums connected by a [[Spring (device)|spring]]. If the pendulums are identical, then their equations of motion are given by

&lt;math&gt;m\ddot{x}=-mg\frac{x}{l_1}-k(x-y)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;m\ddot{y}=-mg\frac{y}{l_2}-k(x-y)&lt;/math&gt;

These equations represent the [[simple harmonic motion]] of the pendulum with an added coupling factor of the spring.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Physics of Vibrations and Waves, Fourth Edition|last=Pain|first=H.J.|publisher=Wiley|year=1993|isbn=0 471 93742 8|location=West Sussex, England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior is also seen in certain molecules (such as [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), wherein &lt;dfn&gt;two of the atoms &lt;/dfn&gt;will vibrate around a central &lt;dfn&gt;one in a similar &lt;/dfn&gt;manner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Coupled LC circuits ===
[[File:LC coupling.png|thumb|Two LC circuits coupled together.]]
In [[LC circuit]]s, charge oscillates between the [[capacitor]] and the [[inductor]] and can therefore be modeled as a simple harmonic oscillator. When the [[magnetic flux]] from &lt;dfn&gt;one inductor is able &lt;/dfn&gt;to affect the [[inductance]] of an inductor in an unconnected LC circuit, the circuits are said to be coupled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The coefficient of coupling k defines how closely the &lt;dfn&gt;two circuits are coupled &lt;/dfn&gt;and is given by the equation

&lt;math&gt;\frac{M}{\sqrt{L_pL_s}}=k&lt;/math&gt;

Where M is the [[Mutual Inductance|mutual inductance]] of the circuits and L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; are the inductances of the primary and secondary circuits, respectively. If the flux lines of the primary inductor thread every line of the secondary one, then the coefficient of coupling is&lt;dfn&gt; 1 and &lt;/dfn&gt;&lt;math&gt;M=\sqrt{L_pL_s}&lt;/math&gt; In practice, however, there is of&lt;dfn&gt;ten leakage&lt;/dfn&gt;, so most systems are not perfectly coupled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:1H NMR Ethyl Acetate Coupling shown.png|thumb|Peaks in an NMR image of Ethyl Acetate.]]

==Chemistry==
=== Spin-spin coupling ===
[[Angular momentum coupling|Spin-spin coupling]] occurs when the [[magnetic field]] of &lt;dfn&gt;one atom affects the &lt;/dfn&gt;magnetic field of another nearby atom. This is very common in [[Magnetic resonance imaging|NMR imaging]]. If the atoms are not coupled, then there will be &lt;dfn&gt;two individual peaks&lt;/dfn&gt;, known as a doublet, representing the individual atoms. If coupling is present, then there will be a triplet, &lt;dfn&gt;one larger peak with two smaller ones to &lt;/dfn&gt;either side. This occurs due to the [[Spin (physics)|spins]] of the individual atoms oscillating in tandem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Textbook_Maps/Organic_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Map%3A_Organic_Chemistry_With_a_Biological_Emphasis_(Soderberg)/Chapter_05%3A_Structure_Determination_II/5.5%3A_Spin-spin_coupling|title=5.5 Spin-Spin Coupling|last=|first=|date=2015-07-21|website=Chemistry Libretexts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 Apr 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astrophysics==

Objects in space which are coupled to each other are under the mutual influence of each other's [[gravity]]. For instance, the Earth is coupled to both the sun and the moon, as it is under the gravitational influence of both. Common in space are [[binary system]]s, two objects gravitationally coupled to each other. Examples of this are [[binary star]]s which circle each other. Multiple objects may also be coupled to each other simultaneously, such as with [[globular cluster]]s and [[galaxy group]]s. When smaller particles, such as dust, which are coupled together over time accumulate into much larger objects, [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] is occurring. This is the major process by which stars and planets form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Universe, Second Edition|last=Kaufmann|first=William|publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company|year=1988|isbn=978-0-7167-1927-4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plasma==
{{main|Frequency classification of plasmas}}

The coupling constant of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is given by the ratio of its average [[Coulomb interaction|Coulomb-interaction]] energy to its average [[kinetic energy]]‚Äîor how strongly the electric force of each atom holds the plasma together .&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plasma Physics|last=Ichimaru|first=Setsuo|publisher=Benjamin/Cumming Publishing Company|year=1986|isbn=978-0-8053-8754-4|location=Menlo Park, California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasmas can therefore be categorized into weakly- and strongly-coupled plasmas depending upon the value of this ratio. Many of the typical classical plasmas, such as the plasma in the [[Corona|solar corona]], are weakly coupled, while the plasma in a [[white dwarf]] star is an example of a strongly coupled plasma.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Quantum mechanics ==
Two coupled quantum systems can be modeled by a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of the form[[File:Spin orbit coupling dispersion relation.pdf|thumb|Dispersion relations for non-coupled, weakly-coupled, and strongly-coupled particles]]&lt;math&gt;\hat{H}=\hat{H}_a+\hat{H}_b+\hat{V}_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;
which is the addition of the two Hamiltonians in isolation with an added interaction factor. In most simple systems, &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_b&lt;/math&gt; can be solved exactly while &lt;math&gt;\hat{V}_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; can be solved through [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introductory Applied Quantum and Statistical Mechanics|last=Hagelstein|first=Peter|last2=Senturia|first2=Stephen|last3=Orlando|first3=Terry|publisher=Wiley|year=2004|isbn=978-0-471-20276-9|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the two systems have similar total energy, then the system may undergo [[Rabi oscillation]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Angular momentum coupling ===
{{main article|Angular momentum coupling}}

When [[Angular momentum operator|angular momenta]] from two separate sources interact with each other, they are said to be coupled.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quantum Mechanics, Third Edition|last=Merzbacher|first=Eugene|publisher=Wiley|year=1998|isbn=978-0-471--88702-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, two [[electron]]s orbiting around the same [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] may have coupled angular momenta. Due to the [[Conservation of Angular Momentum|conservation of angular momentum]] and the nature of the [[angular momentum operator]], the total angular momentum is always the sum of the individual angular momenta of the electrons, or

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}=\mathbf{J_1}+\mathbf{J_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Spin‚Äìorbit interaction|Spin-Orbit interaction]] (also known as spin-orbit coupling) is a special case of angular momentum coupling. Specifically, it is the interaction between the [[Spin (physics)|intrinsic spin]] of a particle, '''S''', and its orbital angular momentum, '''L'''. As they are both forms of angular momentum, they must be conserved. Even if energy is transferred between the two, the total angular momentum, '''J''', of the system must be constant, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}=\mathbf{L}+\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Particle physics and quantum field theory ==
[[File:Gluon coupling.svg|thumb|Examples of gluon coupling]]
[[Particle]]s which interact with each other are said to be coupled. This interaction is caused by one of the fundamental forces, whose strengths are usually given by a dimensionless [[coupling constant]]. In [[quantum electrodynamics]], this value is known as the [[fine-structure constant]] Œ±, approximately equal to 1/137. For [[quantum chromodynamics]], the constant changes with respect to the distance between the particles. This phenomenon is known as ''[[asymptotic freedom]].'' Forces which have a coupling constant greater than 1 are said to be "strongly coupled" while those with constants less than one are said to be "weakly coupled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elementary Particle-Second, Revised Edition|last=Griffiths|first=David|publisher=Wiley-VCH|year=2010|isbn=978-3-527-40601-2|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christ at the Cross - Cristo en la Cruz.jpg|thumb|''Christ at the Cross'' by [[Carl Bloch]], painting c. 1870]]
'''Crucifixion''' is a method of [[capital punishment]] in which the victim is tied or nailed to a large wooden beam and left to hang for several days until eventual death from exhaustion and [[asphyxiation]].&lt;ref name=josephus-jewishwars-5.11.1&gt;{{cite Josephus | PACEJ=1 | text=wars | bookno=5 | chap=11 | sec=1 |Perseus=1 | 1=J. | 2=BJ | 3=5.11.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Edwards |first1=William D. |title=On the Physical Death of Jesus Christ |journal=JAMA |date=March 21, 1986 |volume=255 |issue=11 |pages=1455 |doi=10.1001/jama.1986.03370110077025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Byard |first1=Roger W. |title=Forensic and historical aspects of crucifixion |journal=Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology |date=March 5, 2016 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=206‚Äì208 |doi=10.1007/s12024-016-9758-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Greek has two verbs for crucify: ''ana-stauro'' (·ºÄŒΩŒ±œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅœåœâ), from ''stauros'', "stake", and ''apo-tumpanizo'' (·ºÄœÄŒøœÑœÖŒºœÄŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ∂œâ) "crucify on a plank",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da)potumpani%2Fzw&amp;highlight=crucify LSJ apotumpanizo] ·ºÄœÄŒøœÑœÖŒºœÄŒ±^ŒΩ-ŒØŒ∂œâ (later ·ºÄœÄŒøœÑœçŒºœÄŒ±^ŒΩ-œÑœÖœÄ- UPZ119 (2nd century BC), POxy.1798.1.7), A. crucify on a plank, D.8.61,9.61:‚ÄîPass., Lys.13.56, D.19.137, Arist.

New Testament Greek uses four verbs, three of them based upon ''stauros'' (œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅœåœÇ), usually translated "cross". The most common term is ''stauroo'' (œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅœåœâ), "to crucify", occurring 43 times; ''sustauroo'' (œÉœÖœÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅœåœâ), "to crucify with" or "alongside" occurs five times, while ''anastauroo'' (·ºÄŒΩŒ±œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅœåœâ), "to crucify again" occurs only once at the Epistle to the Hebrews 6:6. ''prospegnumi'' (œÄœÅŒøœÉœÄŒÆŒ≥ŒΩœÖŒºŒπ), "to fix or fasten to, impale, crucify" occurs only once at the Acts of the Apostles 2:23.

The English term ''[[cross]]'' derives from the Latin word ''crux''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cross |title=Online Etymology Dictionary, "cross" |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin term ''crux'' classically referred to a tree or any construction of wood used to hang criminals as a form of execution. The term later came to refer specifically to a cross.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dcrux Charlton T.

The English term ''[[crucifix]]'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''crucifixus'' or ''cruci fixus'', past participle passive of ''crucifigere'' or ''cruci figere'', meaning "to crucify" or "to fasten to a cross".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/crucify |title=Collins English Dictionary, "crucify" |publisher=Collins |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/crucify?view=uk |title=Compact Oxford English Dictionary, "crucify" |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://websters.yourdictionary.com/crucify |title=Webster New World College Dictionary, "crucify" |work=yourdictionary.com/ |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=crucify |title=Online Etymology Dictionary, "crucify"|publisher=Etymonline.com|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Santo_Spirito,_sagrestia,_crocifisso_di_michelangelo_04.JPG|thumb|This crucifix is attributed to [[Michelangelo]], notable for showing naked crucifixion.]]
Crucifixion was most often performed to dissuade its witnesses from perpetrating similar (usually particularly heinous) crimes. Victims were sometimes left on display after death as a warning to any other potential criminals. Crucifixion was usually intended to provide a death that was particularly slow, painful (hence the term ''excruciating'', literally "out of crucifying"), gruesome, humiliating, and public, using whatever means were most expedient for that goal. Crucifixion methods varied considerably with location and time period.

The Greek and Latin words corresponding to "crucifixion" applied to many different forms of painful execution, including [[impalement|being impaled on a stake]], or affixed to a tree, upright pole (a [[crux simplex]]), or (most famous now) to a combination of an upright (in Latin, ''stipes'') and a crossbeam (in Latin, ''patibulum''). [[Seneca the Younger]] wrote: "I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some impale their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/sen.consolatione2.shtml+stipitem+patibulo|title=Dialogue "To Marcia on Consolation", 6.20.3 |publisher=[[The Latin Library]] |language=la|author=|date=|website=googleusercontent.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the condemned was forced to carry the crossbeam to the place of execution.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Cross and Crucifixion |volume=7 |page=506 |first=Thomas Macall |last=Fallow |authorlink=Thomas Macall Fallow}}&lt;/ref&gt; A whole cross would weigh well over 135&amp;nbsp;kg (300&amp;nbsp;lb), but the crossbeam would not be quite as burdensome, weighing around 45&amp;nbsp;kg (100&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref name=Mississippi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball|first=DA|title=The crucifixion and death of a man called Jesus|journal=Journal of the Mississippi State Medical Association|year=1989|volume=30|issue=3|pages=77‚Äì83|pmid=2651675}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] records that the city of Rome had a specific place for carrying out executions, situated outside the [[Esquiline Gate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.ann2.shtml#32 |title=Annales 2:32.2 |publisher=Thelatinlibrary.com |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a specific area reserved for the execution of slaves by crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.ann15.shtml#60 |title=Annales 15:60.1 |publisher=Thelatinlibrary.com |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upright posts would presumably be fixed permanently in that place, and the crossbeam, with the condemned person perhaps already nailed to it, would then be attached to the post.

The person executed may have been attached to the cross by rope, though nails and other sharp materials are mentioned in a passage by the Judean historian [[Josephus]], where he states that at the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)]], "the soldiers out of rage and hatred, ''nailed'' those they caught, one after one way, and another after another, to the crosses, by way of jest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flavius|first1=Josephus|title=Jewish War, Book V Chapter 11|url=http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/war-5.htm|publisher=ccel.org|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects used in the crucifixion of criminals, such as nails, were sought as [[amulets]] with perceived medicinal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Mishna, Shabbath 6.10: see [https://books.google.com/books?id=EdbdQ-5fMr0C&amp;pg=PA182 David W. Chapman, ''Ancient Jewish and Christian Perceptions of Crucifixion''] (Mohn Siebeck 2008 {{ISBN|978-31-6149579-3}}), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

While a crucifixion was an execution, it was also a humiliation, by making the condemned as vulnerable as possible. Although artists have traditionally depicted the figure on a cross with a loin cloth or a covering of the genitals, the person being crucified was usually stripped naked. Writings by [[Seneca the Younger]] state some victims suffered a stick forced upwards through their groin.&lt;ref name="Seneca 1946"&gt;Seneca, Dialogue "To Marcia on Consolation", in ''Moral Essays'', 6.20.3, trans. John W. Basore, The Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1946) 2:69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Of Consolation: To Marcia#XX.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its frequent use by the Romans, the horrors of crucifixion did not escape criticism by some eminent Roman orators.

What shall I say of crucifying him? So guilty an action cannot by any possibility be adequately expressed by any name bad enough for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0018:text=Ver.:actio=2:book=5:section=170|title=M.

Frequently, the legs of the person executed were broken or shattered with an iron club, an act called ''crurifragium'', which was also frequently applied without crucifixion to slaves.&lt;ref name="Wine"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koskenniemi|first=Erkki|author2=Kirsi Nisula|author3=Jorma Toppari|title=Wine Mixed with Myrrh (Mark 15.23) and Crurifragium (John 19.31-32): Two Details of the Passion Narratives|journal=Journal for the Study of the New Testament|volume=27|issue=4|pages=379‚Äì391|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2005|url=http://jnt.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/27/4/379|doi=10.1177/0142064X05055745|accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act hastened the death of the person but was also meant to [[Punishment#Deterrence (prevention)|deter]] those who observed the crucifixion from committing offenses.&lt;ref name="Wine"/&gt;

The [[gibbet]] on which crucifixion was carried out could be of many shapes. [[Josephus]] describes several tortures and positions of crucifixion during the [[siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] as [[Titus]] crucified the rebels;&lt;ref name=josephus-jewishwars-5.11.1/&gt; and [[Seneca the Younger]] recounts: "I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some [[Impalement|impale]] their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet."&lt;ref name="Seneca 1946"/&gt;

At times the gibbet was only one vertical stake, called in Latin ''crux simplex''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBOqGJc6tpcC&amp;pg=PA78 |first=William |last=Barclay |title=The Apostles' Creed |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-664-25826-9 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the simplest available construction for torturing and killing the condemned. Frequently, however, there was a cross-piece attached either at the top to give the shape of a T (''crux commissa'') or just below the top, as in the form most familiar in Christian symbolism (''crux immissa'').&lt;ref&gt;"The&amp;nbsp;... oldest depiction of a crucifixion&amp;nbsp;... was uncovered by archaeologists more than a century ago on the [[Palatine Hill]] in Rome. It is a second-century [[graffiti]] scratched into a wall that was part of the imperial palace complex. It includes a caption&amp;nbsp;‚Äî not by a Christian, but by someone taunting and deriding Christians and the crucifixions they underwent. It shows crude [[stick figure|stick-figures]] of a boy reverencing his 'God', who has the head of a [[donkey|jackass]] and is upon a cross with arms spread wide and with hands nailed to the crossbeam.

Bower, Jr. [http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1991/9110fea1.asp "Cross or Torture Stake?"]&lt;/ref&gt; The most ancient image of a Roman crucifixion depicts an individual on a T-shaped cross. It is a graffito found in a taberna (hostel for wayfarers) in Puteoli, dating to the time of [[Trajan]] or [[Hadrian]] (late 1st century to early 2nd century AD).&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=John Granger|year=2012|title=Crucifixion as Spectacle in Roman Campania|journal=Novum Testamentum|volume=54|issue=1|pages=60, 92‚Äì98|jstor=23253630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 2nd-century writers took it for granted that a crucified person's arms would be stretched out, not connected to a single stake: [[Lucian]] speaks of [[Prometheus]] as crucified "above the ravine with his hands outstretched" and explains that the letter T (the Greek letter [[tau]]) was looked upon as an unlucky letter or sign (similar to the way the number thirteen is looked upon today as an unlucky number), saying that the letter got its "evil significance" because of the "evil instrument" which had that shape, an instrument on which tyrants crucified people. [[Jehovah's Witness]]es argue that Jesus was crucified on a ''crux simplex'', and that the ''crux immissa'' was first used as a Christian symbol near the time of the supposed conversion of [[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why do Watch Tower publications show Jesus on a stake with hands over his head instead of on the traditional cross?|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101989219|publisher=Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms were in the shape of the letters X and Y.

The New Testament writings about the crucifixion of Jesus do not speak specifically about the shape of that cross, but the early writings that do speak of its shape, from about the year AD 100 on, describe it as shaped like the letter T (the Greek letter tau)&lt;ref&gt;[[Epistle of Barnabas]], [[wikisource:Epistle of Barnabas#Chapter 9|Chapter 9]]. The document no doubt belongs to the end of the 1st or beginning of the 2nd century.[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/barnabas-intro.html]&lt;/ref&gt; or as composed of an upright and a transverse beam, sometimes with a small projection in the upright.&lt;ref&gt;"The very form of the cross, too, has five extremities, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is fixed by the nails" ([[Irenaeus]] (c. 130‚Äì202), ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]]'' II, xxiv, 4 [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103224.htm]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin Martyr]] (c. 100‚Äì165) [[Dialogue with Trypho]] [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.xc.html "Chapter XC ‚Äì The stretched-out hands of Moses signified beforehand the cross"], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.xci.html "Chapter XCI"] "For the one beam is placed upright, from which the highest extremity is raised up into a horn, when the other beam is fitted on to it, and the ends appear on both sides as horns joined on to the one horn." &lt;br&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.cxi.html "Chapter CXI"] "stretching out his hands, remained till evening on the hill, his hands being supported; and this reveals a type of no other thing than of the cross"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nail placement===
[[File:CrucifixionSt.Matts.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Crucifixion window by [[Henry E. Sharp]], 1872, in [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]], Charleston, South Carolina]]
In popular depictions of the crucifixion of Jesus (possibly because in translations of {{bibleverse||John|20:25}} the wounds are described as being "in his hands"), Jesus is shown with nails in his hands. But in Greek the word "œáŒµŒØœÅ", usually translated as "hand", could refer to the entire portion of the arm below the elbow,&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Homeric Greek]] of the [[Iliad]] XX, 478‚Äì480, a spear-point is said to have pierced the œáŒµ·øñœÅ "where the sinews of the elbow join" (·ºµŒΩŒ± œÑŒµ ŒæŒµŒΩŒ≠œáŒøœÖœÉŒπ œÑŒ≠ŒΩŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ / ·ºÄŒ≥Œ∫·ø∂ŒΩŒøœÇ, œÑ·øá œÑœåŒΩ Œ≥Œµ œÜŒØŒªŒ∑œÇ Œ¥Œπ·Ω∞ œáŒµŒπœÅ·Ω∏œÇ ·ºîœÄŒµŒπœÅŒµŒΩ / Œ±·º∞œáŒº·øá œáŒ±Œ∫ŒªŒ∫ŒµŒØ·øÉ).&lt;/ref&gt; and to denote the ''hand'' as distinct from the ''arm'' some other word could be added, as "·ºÑŒ∫œÅŒ∑ŒΩ Œø·ΩîœÑŒ±œÉŒµ œáŒµ·øñœÅŒ±" (he wounded the end of the œáŒµŒØœÅ, i.e., "he wounded her in the hand".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|xe/ir|œáŒµŒØœÅ|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possibility that does not require tying is that the nails were inserted just above the wrist, between the two bones of the forearm (the [[radius (bone)|radius]] and the [[ulna]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jonathan |last=Wynne-Jones |title=Why the BBC thinks Christ did not die this way |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/03/16/nrowan216.xml |work= |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=16 March 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An experiment that was the subject of a documentary on the [[National Geographic Channel]]'s ''Quest For Truth: The Crucifixion'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7291066/#storyContinued/ |title=a brief news article|publisher=MSNBC|date=2005-03-25|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that nailed feet provided enough support for the body, and that the hands could have been merely tied. Nailing the feet to the side of the cross relieves strain on the wrists by placing most of the weight on the lower body.

Another possibility, suggested by [[Frederick Zugibe]], is that the nails may have been driven in at an angle, entering in the palm in the crease that delineates the bulky region at the base of the thumb, and exiting in the wrist, passing through the [[carpal tunnel]].

A foot-rest (''suppedaneum'') attached to the cross, perhaps for the purpose of taking the person's weight off the wrists, is sometimes included in representations of the crucifixion of Jesus, but is not discussed in ancient sources. Some scholars interpret the [[Alexamenos graffito]], the earliest surviving depiction of the Crucifixion, as including such a foot-rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The beauty of the cross: the passion of Christ in theology and the arts, from the catacombs to the eve of the Renaissance |last=Viladesau |first=Richard|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518811-0|oclc=58791208|page=21 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cTFh4tm9cMwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient sources also mention the ''sedile'', a small seat attached to the front of the cross, about halfway down,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=905&amp;letter=C|title=Crucifixion|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=2018-03-06|first1=Kaufmann|last1=Kohler|first2=Emil G.|last2=Hirsch}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could have served a similar purpose.

In 1968, archaeologists discovered at [[Giv'at ha-Mivtar]] in northeast [[Jerusalem]] the remains of one [[Jehohanan]], who had been crucified in the 1st century. The remains included a heel bone with a nail driven through it from the side. The tip of the nail was bent, perhaps because of striking a knot in the upright beam, which prevented it being extracted from the foot. A first inaccurate account of the length of the nail led some to believe that it had been driven through both heels, suggesting that the man had been placed in a sort of sidesaddle position, but the true length of the nail, 11.5&amp;nbsp;cm (4.53&amp;nbsp;inches), suggests instead that in this case of crucifixion the heels were nailed to opposite sides of the upright.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chesterrep.openrepository.com/cdr/bitstream/10034/40813/1/Some%20Notes%20on%20Crucifixion.pdf|title=Some Notes on Crucifixion|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-12-19|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110718171841/http://chesterrep.openrepository.com/cdr/bitstream/10034/40813/1/Some%20Notes%20on%20Crucifixion.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EdbdQ-5fMr0C David W.

A theory attributed to [[Pierre Barbet (physician)|Pierre Barbet]] holds that, when the whole body weight was supported by the stretched arms, the typical cause of death was [[asphyxiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/arch/barbet.html|title=Columbia University page of Pierre Barbet on Crucifixion|author=|date=|website=columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that the condemned would have severe difficulty inhaling, due to hyper-expansion of the chest muscles and lungs. The condemned would therefore have to draw himself up by the arms, leading to [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]], or have his feet supported by tying or by a wood block. When no longer able to lift himself, the condemned would die within a few minutes. Some scholars, including [[Frederick Zugibe]], posit other causes of death. Zugibe suspended test subjects with their arms at 60¬∞ to 70¬∞ from the vertical. The test subjects had no difficulty breathing during experiments, but did suffer rapidly increasing pain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Zugibe|first=Frederick T|authorlink=Frederick Zugibe|title=The cross and the shroud: a medical inquiry into the crucifixion|publisher=Paragon House|location=New York|year=1988|isbn=0-913729-75-2}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Zugibe, Frederick T. |title=The Crucifixion Of Jesus: A Forensic Inquiry |publisher=M.

However, Zugibe's positioning of the test subjects' feet is not supported by any archaeological or historical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1420788|pmid=16574970|doi=10.1258/jrsm.99.4.185|volume=99|issue=4|title=Medical theories on the cause of death in crucifixion|year=2006|journal=J R Soc Med|pages=185‚Äì8|last1=Maslen|first1=MW|last2=Mitchell|first2=PD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survival===
Since death does not follow immediately on crucifixion, survival after a short period of crucifixion is possible, as in the case of those who choose each year [[#As a devotional practice|as a devotional practice]] to be non-lethally crucified.

There is an ancient record of one person who survived a crucifixion that was intended to be lethal, but that was interrupted. [[Josephus]] recounts: "I saw many captives crucified, and remembered three of them as my former acquaintance. I was very sorry at this in my mind, and went with tears in my eyes to [[Titus]], and told him of them; so he immediately commanded them to be taken down, and to have the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet two of them died under the physician's hands, while the third recovered."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/autobiog.htm The Life Of Flavius Josephus], 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus gives no details of the method or duration of the crucifixion of his three friends before their reprieve.

==Archaeological evidence==
Although the ancient Jewish historian Josephus, as well as other sources,{{which|date=June 2015}} refers to the crucifixion of thousands of people by the Romans, there is only a single archaeological discovery of a [[Jehohanan|crucified body]] dating back to the Roman Empire around the time of Jesus. This was discovered at [[Givat HaMivtar]], Jerusalem in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Tzaferis, V. 1970 Jewish Tombs at and near Giv'at ha-Mivtar. Israel Exploration Journal Vol. 20 pp. 18-32.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not necessarily surprising that there is only one such discovery, because a crucified body was usually left to decay on the cross and therefore would not be preserved. The only reason these archaeological remains were preserved was because family members gave this particular individual a customary burial.

The remains were found accidentally in an [[ossuary]] with the crucified man's name on it, '[[Jehohanan]], the son of Hagakol'.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Nicu.

Maier|publisher=Google Books|isbn=978-0-8254-3329-0|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicu Haas, an anthropologist at the Hebrew University Medical School in Jerusalem, examined the ossuary and discovered that it contained a heel bone with a nail driven through its side, indicating that the man had been crucified. The position of the nail relative to the bone indicates that the feet had been nailed to the cross from their side, not from their front; various opinions have been proposed as to whether they were both nailed together to the front of the cross or one on the left side, one on the right side. The point of the nail had olive wood fragments on it indicating that he was crucified on a cross made of olive wood or on an olive tree.

Additionally, a piece of acacia wood was located between the bones and the head of the nail, presumably to keep the condemned from freeing his foot by sliding it over the nail. His legs were found broken, possibly to hasten his death. It is thought that because in Roman times iron was rare, the nails were removed from the dead body to conserve costs. According to Haas, this could help to explain why only one nail has been found, as the tip of the nail in question was bent in such a way that it could not be removed.

Haas had also identified a scratch on the inner surface of the right radius bone of the forearm, close to the wrist. He deduced from the form of the scratch, as well as from the intact wrist bones, that a nail had been driven into the forearm at that position. However, many of Haas' findings have been challenged. For instance, it was subsequently determined that the scratches in the wrist area were non-traumatic ‚Äì and, therefore, not evidence of crucifixion ‚Äì while reexamination of the heel bone revealed that the two heels were not nailed together, but rather separately to either side of the upright post of the cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authors=Zias J. &amp; Sekeles, E. |year=1985 |title=The Crucified Man from Giv'at ha-Mivtar: A Reappraisal. |journal=Israel Exploration Journal |issue=35 |pages=22‚Äì27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and religious texts==
===Pre-Roman states===
Crucifixion (or impalement), in one form or another, was used by [[Achaemenid Persia|Persians]], [[Carthaginians]], and [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]].

The Greeks were generally opposed to performing crucifixions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/LX/Stavros.html Stavros, Scolops (œÉœÑŒ±·ø¶œÅœåœÇ, œÉŒ∫œåŒªŒøœà). The cross;] encyclopedia Hellinica&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his ''Histories'', ix.120‚Äì122, the Greek writer [[Herodotus]] describes the execution of a Persian general at the hands of Athenians in about 479 BC: "They nailed him to a plank and hung him up&amp;nbsp;... this [[Artayctes]] who suffered death by crucifixion."&lt;ref&gt;Translation by Aubrey de Selincourt. The original, "œÉŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ¥Œ± œÄœÅŒøœÉœÄŒ±œÉœÉŒ±ŒªŒµœçœÉŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµœÇ, ·ºÄŒΩŒµŒ∫œÅŒ≠ŒºŒ±œÉŒ±ŒΩ&amp;nbsp;... Œ§ŒøœçœÑŒøœÖ Œ¥·Ω≤ œÑŒø·ø¶ ·ºàœÅœÑŒ±œçŒ∫œÑŒµœâ œÑŒø·ø¶ ·ºÄŒΩŒ±Œ∫œÅŒµŒºŒ±œÉŒ∏Œ≠ŒΩœÑŒøœÇ&amp;nbsp;...", is translated by Henry Cary (Bohn's Classical Library: ''Herodotus Literally Translated''. London, G. Bell and Sons 1917, pp.&amp;nbsp;591‚Äì592) as: "They nailed him to a plank and hoisted him aloft&amp;nbsp;... this Artayctes who was hoisted aloft".&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Commentary on Herodotus'' by How and Wells remarks: "They crucified him with hands and feet stretched out and nailed to cross-pieces; cf. vii.33. This barbarity, unusual on the part of Greeks, may be explained by the enormity of the outrage or by Athenian deference to local feeling."&lt;ref&gt;W.W. How and J. Wells, ''A Commentary on Herodotus'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1912), vol. 2, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian [[theologian]]s, beginning with [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] [[Tarsus (city)|of Tarsus]] writing in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] {{bibleverse-nb||Gal|3:13}}, have interpreted an allusion to crucifixion in [[Deuteronomy]] {{bibleverse-nb||Deut|21:22-23}}. This reference is to being hanged from a tree, and may be associated with [[lynching]] or traditional hanging. However, Rabbinic law limited capital punishment to just 4 methods of execution: stoning, burning, strangulation, and decapitation, while the passage in Deuteronomy was interpreted as an obligation to hang the corpse on a tree as a form of deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;See Mishnah, Sanhedrin 7:1, translated in Jacob Neusner, The Mishnah: A New Translation 591 (1988), supra note 8, at 595-96 (indicating that court ordered execution by stoning, burning, decapitation, or strangulation only)&lt;/ref&gt; The fragmentary Aramaic Testament of Levi (DSS 4Q541) interprets in column 6: "God ... (partially legible)-''will set'' ... right errors. ... (partially legible)-''He will judge'' ... revealed sins. Investigate and seek and know how Jonah wept. Thus, you shall not destroy the weak by wasting away or by ... (partially legible)-''crucifixion'' ... Let not the nail touch him."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/scrolls_deadsea/uncovered/uncovered05.htm Levi,''Aramaic Testament of Levi'' 4Q541 column 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish king [[Alexander Jannaeus]], king of Judea from 103 BC to 76 BC, crucified 800 rebels, said to be [[Pharisees]], in the middle of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pbpSjsz_uY8C&amp;pg=PA46 |first=Wenhua |last=Shi |title=Paul's Message of the Cross As Body Language |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |year=2008 |isbn=978-3-16-149706-3 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2g7hBhKI31QC&amp;pg=PA110 |first=James C. |last=VanderKam |title=The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Bible |publisher=Eerdmans |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-8028-6679-0 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander the Great]] is reputed to have crucified 2,000 survivors from his [[Siege of Tyre (332 BC)|siege]] of the [[Phoenicia]]n city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_t09.html Quintus Curtius Rufus, ''History of Alexander the Great of Macedonia'' 4.4.21]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the doctor who unsuccessfully treated Alexander's friend [[Hephaestion]]. Some historians have also conjectured that Alexander crucified [[Callisthenes]], his official historian and biographer, for objecting to Alexander's adoption of the Persian ceremony of [[Proskynesis|royal adoration]].

In [[Carthage]], crucifixion was an established mode of execution, which could even be imposed on generals for suffering a major defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-VlDC4Jt6gC&amp;pg=PT92&amp;lpg=PT92|first=Richard A.|last=Gabriel |title=Hannibal |publisher=Potomac Books|year=2011|isbn=978-1-59797-766-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGQBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA302|first=Henry George|last=Liddell|title=A History of Rome|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1855|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_pZEpbG498C&amp;pg=PA23|first=Robin|last=Waterfield|title=Polybius. The Histories|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-953470-8|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest crucifixion may be a post-mortem one mentioned by [[Herodotus]]. [[Polycrates]], the tyrant of [[Samos]], was put to death in 522 B.C. by Persians, and his dead body was then crucified.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'', {{Herodotus|en|3|125}} ("Having killed him in some way not fit to be told, Oroetes then crucified him")&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===

==== History ====
The hypothesis that the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] custom of crucifixion may have developed out of a primitive custom of ''arbori suspendere''‚Äîhanging on an ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#arbor felix|arbor infelix]]'' ("inauspicious tree") dedicated to the gods of the nether world‚Äîis rejected by William A. Oldfather, who shows that this form of execution (the ''supplicium more maiorum'', punishment in accordance with the custom of our ancestors) consisted of suspending someone from a tree, not dedicated to any particular gods, and flogging him to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/journals/TAPA/39/Supplicium_de_More_Maiorum*.html|title=Livy I.26 and the Supplicium de More Maiorum|publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]] mentions a 1st-century AD case in which trees were used for crucifixion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grtbooks.com/exitfram.asp?idx=3&amp;yr=200&amp;aa=AA&amp;at=AA&amp;ref=tertullian&amp;URL=http://www.tertullian.org/latin/apologeticus.htm |title=''Apologia'', IX, 1 |publisher=Grtbooks.com|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Seneca the Younger]] earlier used the phrase ''infelix lignum'' (unfortunate wood) for the transom ("patibulum") or the whole cross.&lt;ref&gt;After quoting a poem by [[Maecenas]] that speaks of preferring life to death even when life is burdened with all the disadvantages of old age or even with acute torture ("vel acuta si sedeam cruce"), Seneca disagrees with the sentiment, saying death would be better for a crucified person hanging from the patibulum: "I should deem him most despicable had he wished to live to the point of crucifixion&amp;nbsp;... Is it worth so much to weigh down upon one's own wound, and hang stretched out from a patibulum?&amp;nbsp;... Is anyone found who, after being fastened to that accursed wood, already weakened, already deformed, swelling with ugly weals on shoulders and chest, with many reasons for dying even before getting to the cross, would wish to prolong a life-breath that is about to experience so many torments?" ("Contemptissimum putarem, si vivere vellet usque ad crucem&amp;nbsp;... Est tanti vulnus suum premere et patibulo pendere districtum&amp;nbsp;... Invenitur, qui velit adactus ad illud infelix lignum, iam debilis, iam pravus et in foedum scapularum ac pectoris tuber elisus, cui multae moriendi causae etiam citra crucem fuerant, trahere animam tot tormenta tracturam?" - [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/seneca.ep17-18.shtml Letter 101, 12-14])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plautus]] and [[Plutarch]] are the two main sources for accounts of criminals carrying their own patibula to the upright ''stipes''.&lt;ref&gt;Titus Maccius Plautus ''Miles gloriosus'' Mason Hammond, Arthur M. Mack - 1997 Page 109, "The patibulum (in the next line) was a crossbar which the convicted criminal carried on his shoulders, with his arms fastened to it, to the place for&amp;nbsp;... Hoisted up on an upright post, the patibulum became the crossbar of the cross"&lt;/ref&gt;

Notorious mass crucifixions followed the [[Third Servile War]] in 73‚Äì71 BC (the slave rebellion under [[Spartacus]]), other [[Roman civil wars]] in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, and the [[destruction of Jerusalem]] in AD 70. [[Crassus]] crucified 6,000 of Spartacus' followers hunted down and captured after his defeat in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#120|title=Appian ‚Ä¢ The Civil Wars ‚Äî Book¬†I|author=|date=|website=penelope.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus tells a story of the Romans crucifying people along the walls of Jerusalem. He also says that the Roman soldiers would amuse themselves by crucifying criminals in different positions.

[[Constantine I|Constantine the Great]], the first Christian [[Roman Empire|emperor]], abolished crucifixion in the Roman Empire in 337 out of veneration for [[Jesus Christ]], its most famous victim.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9028045|title=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: crucifixion|author=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica|publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GGJmFIf6mtIC Dictionary of Images and Symbols in Counselling By William Stewart] 1998 {{ISBN|1-85302-351-5}}, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-archaeology.info/crucifixion.htm|title=Archaeology of the Bible|publisher=Bible-archaeology.info|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crucifixion was typically carried out by specialized teams, consisting of a commanding [[centurion]] and his soldiers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; First, the condemned would be stripped naked&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Doctor at Calvary: The Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ as Described by a Surgeon|last=Barbet|first=P|publisher=Doubleday Image Books|year=1953|isbn=|location=New York|pages=46‚Äì51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[flagellation|scourged.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This would cause the person to lose a large amount of blood, and approach a state of [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]. The convict then usually had to carry the horizontal beam (''patibulum'' in [[Latin]]) to the place of execution, but not necessarily the whole cross.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the death march, the prisoner, probably&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cross and Crucifixion|volume=7|page=506|first=Thomas Macall|last=Fallow|authorlink=Thomas Macall Fallow}} Macall believes that the person would be given back his or her clothing following the scourging.&lt;/ref&gt; still [[nude]] after the scourging,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; would be led through the most crowded streets&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cojs.org/joe-zias-crucifixion-in-antiquity-the-anthropological-evidence/|title=Crucifixion in Antiquity: The Anthropological Evidence|last=Zias|first=Joseph|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310074322/http://cojs.org/joe-zias-crucifixion-in-antiquity-the-anthropological-evidence/|archive-date=2018-03-10|dead-url=yes|access-date=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; bearing a ''titulus'' ‚Äî a sign board proclaiming the prisoner's name and crime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Upon arrival at the place of execution, selected to be especially public,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joezias.com:80/MelGibsonControversy.htm|title=Postscript - The Mel Gibson Controversy|last=Zias|first=Joseph|date=|website=JoeZias.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040306140009/http://www.joezias.com:80/MelGibsonControversy.htm|archive-date=2004-03-06|dead-url=yes|access-date=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the convict would be stripped of any remaining clothing, then nailed to the cross naked.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; If the crucifixion took place in an established place of execution, the vertical beam (''stipes'') might be permanently embedded in the ground.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this case, the condemned person's wrists would first be nailed to the ''patibulum'', and then he or she would be hoisted off the ground with ropes to hang from the elevated ''patibulum'' while it was fastened to the ''stipes''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Next the feet or ankles would be nailed to the upright stake.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The 'nails' were tapered iron spikes approximately {{convert|5|to|7|in|cm}} long, with a square shaft {{convert|3/8|in|mm|0}} across.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The ''titulus'' would also be fastened to the cross to notify onlookers of the person's name and crime as they hung on the cross, further maximizing the public impact.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There may have been considerable variation in the position in which prisoners were nailed to their crosses and how their bodies were supported while they died.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [[Seneca the Younger]] recounts: "I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some [[Impalement|impale]] their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet."&lt;ref name="Seneca 1946" /&gt; One source claims that for Jews (apparently not for others), a man would be crucified with his back to the cross as is traditionally depicted, while a woman would be nailed facing her cross, probably with her back to onlookers, or at least with the ''stipes'' providing some semblance of [[modesty]] if viewed from the front.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Such concessions were "unique" and not made outside a Jewish context.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Several sources mention some sort of seat fastened to the ''stipes'' to help support the person's body,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Justin Martyr ''Dialogue with Trypho, a Jew'' 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus ''Against Heresies'' II.24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian ''To the Nations'' I.12&lt;/ref&gt; thereby prolonging the person's [[suffering]]&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and humiliation&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; by preventing the [[asphyxia]]tion caused by hanging without support. Justin Martyr calls the seat a ''cornu'', or "horn,"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; leading some scholars to believe it may have had a pointed shape designed to torment the crucified person.&lt;ref&gt;Barbet, 45; Zugibe, 57; Vassilios Tzaferis, ‚ÄúCrucifixion‚ÄîThe Archaeological Evidence,‚Äù ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' 11.1 (Jan./Feb. 1985), 44-53 (p. 49)&lt;/ref&gt; This would be consistent with Seneca's observation of victims with their private parts impaled.

In Roman-style crucifixion, the condemned could take up to a few days to die, but death was sometimes hastened by human action. "The attending Roman guards could leave the site only after the victim had died, and were known to precipitate death by means of deliberate fracturing of the tibia and/or fibula, spear stab wounds into the heart, sharp blows to the front of the chest, or a smoking fire built at the foot of the cross to asphyxiate the victim."&lt;ref name="patho" /&gt; The Romans sometimes broke the prisoner's legs to hasten death and usually forbade burial.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; On the other hand, the person was often deliberately kept alive as long as possible to prolong their suffering and humiliation, so as to provide the maximum deterrent effect.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Corpses of the crucified were typically left on the crosses to decompose and be eaten by animals.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How Jesus became God: The exaltation of a Jewish preacher from Galilee|last1=Ehrman|first1=Bart D.|date=2014|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0061778186|edition=First|location=New York, NY|pages=133‚Äì165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam spread in a region where many societies, including the Persian and Roman empires, had used crucifixion to punish traitors, rebels, robbers and criminal slaves.&lt;ref name=EI2&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Vogel, F.

Known in Japanese as {{Nihongo|''haritsuke''|Á£î}}, crucifixion was used in Japan before and during the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]]. Several related crucifixion techniques were used. Petra Schmidt, in "Capital Punishment in Japan", writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Capital Punishment in Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fZKH4cbcmQC|last=Schmidt|first=Petra|year=2002|publisher=BRILL|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-12421-9|pages=14‚Äì15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Execution by crucifixion included, first of all, ''hikimawashi'' (i.e, being paraded about town on horseback); then the unfortunate was tied to a cross made from one vertical and two horizontal poles. The cross was raised, the convict speared several times from two sides, and eventually killed with a final thrust through the throat. The corpse was left on the cross for three days. If one condemned to crucifixion died in prison, his body was pickled and the punishment executed on the dead body. Under [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], one of the great 16th-century unifiers, crucifixion upside down (i.e, ''sakasaharitsuke'') was frequently used. Water crucifixion (''mizuharitsuke'') awaited mostly Christians: a cross was raised at low tide; when the high tide came, the convict was submerged under water up to the head, prolonging death for many days}}

[[File:ChristianMartyrsOfNagasaki.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Twenty Six Martyrs of Japan]]
In 1597 [[Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan|twenty-six]] [[Christian]] Martyrs were nailed to crosses at [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], Japan. Among those executed were Saints [[Paulo Miki]], [[Philip of Jesus]] and [[Pedro Bautista]], a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Franciscan]] who had worked about ten years in the [[Philippines]]. The executions marked the beginning of a long history of [[Japanese Martyrs|persecution of Christianity in Japan]], which continued until its decriminalization in 1871.

Crucifixion was used as a punishment for prisoners of war during [[World War II]]. [[Ringer Edwards]], an Australian prisoner of war, was crucified for killing cattle, along with two others. He survived 63 hours before being let down.

In [[Burma]], crucifixion was a central element in several execution rituals. Felix Carey, a missionary in Burma from 1806 to 1812,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baptist.org.uk/Groups/220248/Latest_News.aspx|title=The Baptist Union: Latest News|author=|date=|website=baptist.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Baptist Magazine, Volume 7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEwEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA67|work=Baptist Magazine|year=1815|publisher=Button&amp;son|location=London|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Four or five persons, after being nailed through their hands and feet to a scaffold, had first their tongues cut out, then their mouths slit open from ear to ear, then their ears cut off, and finally their bellies ripped open.

Six people were crucified in the following manner: their hands and feet nailed to a scaffold; then their eyes were extracted with a blunt hook; and in this condition they were left to expire; two died in the course of four days; the rest were liberated, but died of mortification on the sixth or seventh day.

Four persons were crucified, viz. not nailed but tied with their hands and feet stretched out at full length, in an erect posture. In this posture they were to remain till death; every thing they wished to eat was ordered them with a view to prolong their lives and misery. In cases like this, the legs and feet of the criminals begin to swell and mortify at the expiration of three or four days; some are said to live in this state for a fortnight, and expire at last from fatigue and mortification. Those which I saw, were liberated at the end of three or four days.}}

During [[World War I]], there were persistent rumors that German soldiers [[the Crucified Soldier|had crucified a Canadian soldier]] on a tree or barn door with [[bayonet]]s or combat knives.

Crucifixion is still used as a rare method of execution in some countries.

===Jihadism===
On 5 February 2015 the United Nations [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC) reported that the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) had committed "several cases of mass executions of boys, as well as reports of beheadings, crucifixions of children and burying children alive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=CBS News|title=ISIS is killing, torturing and raping children in Iraq, U.N. says|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/isis-is-killing-torturing-and-raping-children-in-iraq-u-n-says/|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other terrorist incidents===
The human rights group Karen Women Organization documented a case of [[Tatmadaw]] forces crucifying several [[Karen people|Karen]] villagers in 2000 in the [[Dooplaya District]] in [[Burma]]'s [[Kayin State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karenwomen.org/Reports/WalkingAmongstSharpKnives.pdf|title=Walking amongst sharp knives |date=February 2010 |work= |publisher=Karen Women Organization|accessdate=19 April 2011 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110421224711/http://www.karenwomen.org/Reports/WalkingAmongstSharpKnives.pdf|archivedate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/investigation/35194/regime-human-rights|title=Regime's human rights abuses go unpunished|date=28 March 2010|work=[[Bangkok Post]]|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2014, an anti-government activist and member of [[AutoMaidan]] was kidnapped by unknown parties and tortured for a week. His captors kept him in the dark, beat him, cut off a piece of his ear, and nailed him to a cross. His captors ultimately left him in a forest outside [[Kiev]] after forcing him to confess to being an American spy and accepting money from the US Embassy in Ukraine to organize protests against then-President Viktor Yanukovych.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ukrainian protestor shows scars where he was nailed to a cross when he was crucified by government supporters 'and forced to declare he was a US spy'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2553159/Ukrainian-protestor-shows-scars-nailed-cross-crucified-government-supporters-forced-declare-US-spy.html|accessdate=11 March 2016|publisher=The Daily Mail|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a video surfaced depicting members of the [[Azov Battalion]], an official regiment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, allegedly crucifying a separatist rebel of [[Novorossiya (confederation)|Novorossiya]] and burning him alive. Therein they declare, "all the separatists, traitors of Ukraine and militia fighters [sic] will be treated the same". The Azov Battalion is [[Azov Battalion#Organisation#Neo-Nazi ideology and symbols|associated with neo-Nazism]] and flaunts symbols associated with the SS such as the [[wolfsangel]] and [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|black sun]]. They allegedly sent the video to the pro-Russian [[hacktivist]] organization CyberBerkut, which responded by threatening to take no Ukrainian Army soldiers or militia fighters as prisoners from then on. The authenticity of this video is unconfirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ukrainian neo-nazis from Azov batallion burned alive a Novorossia resistance fighter on a cross (video 18+)|url=http://www.fort-russ.com/2015/04/ukrainian-neo-nazis-from-azov-batallion.html|accessdate=11 March 2016|publisher=Fort Russ|date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] frowns upon self-crucifixion as a form of devotion: "Penitential practices leading to self-crucifixion with nails are not to be encouraged."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20020513_vers-direttorio_en.html Directory on Popular Piety 144] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623013300/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20020513_vers-direttorio_en.html|date=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the practice is not unknown.

In the [[Philippines]], some Catholics are [[Crucifixion in the Philippines|voluntarily, non-lethally crucified]] for a limited time on [[Good Friday]] to imitate the sufferings of Christ. Pre-sterilised nails are driven through the palm of the hand between the bones, while there is a footrest to which the feet are nailed. Rolando del Campo, a carpenter in [[Pampanga]], vowed to be crucified every Good Friday for 15 years if God would carry his wife through a difficult childbirth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religiousfreaks.com/2006/04/12/man-crucifies-himself-every-good-friday/|title=Man Crucifies Himself Every Good Friday|publisher=Religious Freaks|date=2006-04-12|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[San Pedro Cutud]], [[Ruben Enaje]] has been crucified 27 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Filipino devotees reenact Christ's crucifixion on Good Friday|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/filipino-devotees-reenact-christ-crucifixion-good-friday-article-1.1302347|accessdate=January 22, 2014|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=March 29, 2013|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Church in the Philippines]] has repeatedly voiced disapproval of crucifixions and self-[[flagellation]], while the government has noted that it cannot deter devotees. The [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]] insists that participants in the rites should have [[tetanus]] shots and that the nails used should be sterilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-540453/Boy-15-nailed-cross-Filipinos-whip-crucify-gory-Good-Friday-ritual.html|title=Boy, 15, nailed to a cross as Filipinos whip and crucify themselves in gory Good Friday ritual |accessdate = November 6, 2010|location=London|work=Daily Mail|date=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, a crucifixion is only simulated within a [[passion play]], as in the ceremonial re-enactment that has been performed yearly in the town of [[Passion Play of Iztapalapa|Iztapalapa]], on the outskirts of [[Mexico City]], since 1833,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=23257|title=Religion-Mexico: The Passion According to Iztapalapa|publisher=IPS News|accessdate=2009-12-19|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20091226173652/http://www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=23257|archivedate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the more famous [[Oberammergau Passion Play]]. Also, since at least the mid-19th century, a group of [[flagellants]] in [[New Mexico]], called ''Hermanos de Luz'' ("Brothers of Light"), have annually conducted reenactments of Christ's crucifixion during [[Holy Week]], in which a penitent is tied‚Äîbut not nailed‚Äîto a cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aragon |first1=Ray John De |title=The Penitentes of New Mexico: Hermanos de la Luz |date=2006 |publisher=Sunstone Press |isbn=9780865345041 |page=58 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noimuXOCtFgC&amp;pg=pa58 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous crucifixions==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2018}}
*The rebel slaves of the [[Third Servile War]]: Between 73 BC and 71 BC a band of slaves, eventually numbering about 120,000, under the (at least partial) leadership of [[Spartacus]] were in open revolt against the [[Roman republic]]. The rebellion was eventually crushed and, while Spartacus himself most likely died in the final battle of the revolt, approximately 6,000 of his followers were crucified along the 200&amp;nbsp;km [[Appian Way]] between Capua and Rome as a warning to any other would-be rebels.
* [[Jehohanan]]: Jewish man who was crucified around the same time as Jesus of Nazareth and it is widely accepted that his ankles were nailed to the side of the ''stipes'' of the cross 
*[[Jesus of Nazareth]]: his [[crucifixion of Jesus|death by crucifixion]] under [[Pontius Pilate]] (c. AD 30 or 33), recounted in the four 1st-century canonical [[Gospel]]s, is referred to repeatedly as something well known in the earlier letters of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], for instance, five times in his First Letter to the Corinthians, written in 57 AD (1:13, 1:18, 1:23, 2:2, 2:8). Pilate was the Roman governor of [[Iudaea province]] at the time, and he is explicitly linked with the condemnation of Jesus not only by the Gospels but also by [[Tacitus]],&lt;ref&gt;''Annals'', 15.44.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Responsibility for the death of Jesus]] for details). The civil charge was a claim to be [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]].
*[[Saint Peter]]: Christian apostle, who according to tradition was crucified upside-down at his own request (hence the [[Cross of St. Peter]]), because he did not feel worthy enough to die the same way as Jesus.
*[[Saint Andrew]]: Christian apostle and [[Saint Peter]]'s brother, who is traditionally said to have been crucified on an X-shaped cross (hence the [[Saltire|St. Andrew's Cross]]).
*[[Simeon of Jerusalem]]: second [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Bishops of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]], crucified in either 106 or 107.
*[[Mani (prophet)|Mani]]: the founder of [[Manicheanism]], he was depicted by followers as having died by crucifixion in 274 AD.
*[[Eulalia of Barcelona]] was venerated as a saint. According to her hagiography, she was stripped naked, tortured, and ultimately crucified on an X-shaped cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Friesen |first1=Ilse E. |title=The Female Crucifix: Images of St. Wilgefortis Since the Middle Ages |date=2006 |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ.

*[[Wilgefortis]] was venerated as a saint and represented as a crucified woman, however her legend comes from a misinterpretation of a full-clothed crucifix known as the [[Volto Santo of Lucca]].

'''Dangerous play in rugby union''' is dealt with under the foul play [[Rugby union gameplay|law]] (Law 10) in the official [[International Rugby Board]] (IRB) [[rugby union]] law book. It defines foul play as "anything a player does within the playing enclosure that is against the letter and spirit of the Laws of the Game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/EN/laws/3/10/91/during-the-match/foul-play/definitions/#clause_91|title=Laws of the Game Rugby Union 2010, Law 10 Definitions|publisher = ''[[International Rugby Board]]''|accessdate = 2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under these laws dangerous play includes; [[Punch (combat)|punching]] or striking, [[Stomp (strike)|stamping]] or trampling, and [[Kick|kicking.]]&lt;ref name ="10.4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/EN/laws/3/10/95/method-of-playing-the-match/foul-play/dangerous-play-and-misconduct/#clause_95|title=Laws of the Game Rugby Union 2010, Law 10.4 Dangerous Play and Misconduct|publisher = ''[[International Rugby Board]]''|accessdate = 2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==

If a [[Rugby union match officials|referee]] observes dangerous play they are obliged to penalise and admonish the perpetrator. This can result in a "temporary suspension" ([[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]]) of 10 minutes or even a "sending off" ([[Penalty card#Red card|red card]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/EN/laws/3/10/96/during-the-match/foul-play/sanctions/#clause_96 |title=Laws of the Game Rugby Union 2010, Law 10.5 Sanctions |publisher=''[[International Rugby Board]]'' |accessdate=2010-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725075145/http://www.irblaws.com/EN/laws/3/10/96/during-the-match/foul-play/sanctions/ |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the offence is serious enough further action can be taken after the game, including bans from playing rugby and [[Indictment|criminal charges]]. In some high-profile matches a [[citing commissioner]] is appointed, who can cite any player for dangerous play, whether they have been detected by the referee or not.&lt;ref name="REG17"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.irb.com/mm/document/lawsregs/0/regulation17090730_8711.pdf|title= REGULATION 17. ILLEGAL AND/OR FOUL PLAY AND MISCONDUCT|publisher= ''[[International Rugby Board]]''|accessdate= 2010-04-29|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120609160719/http://www.irb.com/mm/document/lawsregs/0/regulation17090730_8711.pdf|archivedate= 2012-06-09|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In matches where there is no appointed citing commissioner the Unions involved can cite players for dangerous play.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt; During the judicial process the severity of the incident is considered. This is assessed by judging if the offending was intentional, reckless, provoked or premeditated as well as what body part was used (fist, knee, boot etc.), how vulnerable the victim was, the effect of the actions had on the victim and disciplinary record of the offender.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt; When handing out match suspensions for dangerous play the IRB recommends suspension periods based on the type and severity of the offence. For most incidences of dangerous play (punching, stamping, dangerous tackles etc.) they recommend suspensions starting from two weeks, up to a maximum of one year.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt; The more serious offences include striking with the head (up to two years), making contact with the eyes (up to three years), testicle grabbing (up to four years) and biting (up to four years).&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt;

==Misconduct==

The law that deals with dangerous play also applies to misconduct.&lt;ref name ="10.4"/&gt; Misconduct is any conduct (excluding foul play during a match) that is unsporting, unruly, ill-disciplined or that brings the sport of rugby union into disrepute.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt; Misconduct deals with violence or intimidation that occurs within the venue (i.e. changing rooms, tunnel, warmup area), abuse of match officials or spectators, discriminatory statements, [[bribery]], [[betting]] on involved games or lying about past disciplinary records.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt; The penalty handed down for misconduct cases could be a caution, [[Fine (penalty)|fine]], suspension (for a number of matches or time period), exclusion from Rugby Unions or grounds, suspension from Rugby officiating or a combination of the above.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt; Verbal abuse of match officials can be punished by up to a year suspension, while threatening could result in five years and physical abuse of an official could see the offender banned for life.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt; Racial or other discriminatory abuse could see a player banned for up to a year. if the player is banned he or she can go to the crown kings general court so that they can get the time on their ban reduced.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt;

==History==

Early [[Rugby Football|Rugby]] games were played under a code of conduct that varied between each school or club.{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=13}} As the popularity and number of clubs increased a set of standardised rules were developed. On the 24 November 1863 a set of rules were developed by [[the Football Association]] (FA) that included the first law involving dangerous play. Law 10 stated that: "If any player with the ball should run towards his advisories' goal, any player in the opposition side should be at liberty to charge, hold, trip, or hack him, or wrest the ball from him; but no player shall be held or hacked at the same time".{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=14}} Hacking (tripping an opponent and kicking his shins) and carrying the ball were the most contested rules and they were soon scrapped by the FA. This caused some clubs to leave the Association and soon more games were played that involved hacking and carrying the ball than those that followed the FA's "official" laws.{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=15}} Concerns over hacking came to a head in 1870 when a surgeon published a letter in the times complaining about the number of rugby injuries he had dealt with that involved hacking, and chastised the schools for letting it continue.{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=19}}

==Punching and fighting==

During the 1974 Lions tour to South Africa, Lions captain [[Willie McBride (rugby union)|Willie McBride]] devised a plan where on [[99 call|a set call]] every player would attack a South African player, reasoning that this would prevent the referee form penalising any one individual, as he could not send the whole team off.&lt;ref name = "Hew"/&gt;
After French fullback [[Serge Blanco]] was bumped after taking a mark by Englishman [[Nigel Heslop]] during the 1991 Rugby World Cup quarter-final, flanker [[√âric Champ]] knocked Heslop out with a punch.&lt;ref name = "Hew"/&gt; In 1990 English lock [[Paul Ackford]] was unexpectedly hit by a haymaker from Argentine prop [[Federico Mendez]] after being mistaken for another player who made contact with Mendez's head.&lt;ref name = "Hew"/&gt; During the [[British and Irish Lions]] 2001 tour match against Australian state side the [[New South Wales Waratahs]], fullback [[Duncan McRae (rugby)|Duncan McRae]] punched Lions [[Fly half]] [[Ronan O'Gara]] multiple times as he lay prone on the ground.&lt;ref name = "Hew"/&gt; He received a red card and subsequent seven week ban for the offence, although as it occurred during the Australian [[off-season]] he didn't miss any games. In 2009 at a rugby derby involving two of Romania's top teams a mass brawl broke out involving most of the players and reportedly a few spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mass Romanian rugby brawl caught a big hit on film|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=April 14, 2009|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/mass-rugby-brawl-caught-on-film/story-e6frf7jo-1225697244711|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two players received a red card at the time and nine players were later suspended by the Romanian Rugby Federation.

==Dangerous tackles==

New Zealand players [[Tana Umaga]] and [[Kevin Mealamu]] were involved in an alleged [[spear tackle]] on Lions captain [[Brian O'Driscoll]] at the start of the first test during the 2005 tour.&lt;ref name = "Hew"/&gt; The tackle dislocated O'Driscoll's shoulder, putting him out of the rest of the tour.

==Eye-gouging==
{{details|Eye-gouging (rugby union)}}
Eye-gouging is a serious offence  where a player uses hands or fingers to inflict pain in an opponent's eyes. The game's laws refer to it as "contact with eyes or the eye area of an opponent" but such incidents are usually referred to as "eye-gouging" among players and in the media.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news |title=Eye gouging: war is declared on rugby's ‚Äòultimate sin‚Äô |first=Mark |last=Souster |newspaper=The Times (London) |date=2010-01-11 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/rugby_union/article6982910.ece }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRB has made special mention of eye gouging, describing it as "particularly heinous".&lt;ref name="Scotsman"&gt;{{cite news |title=IRB review signals intent to get tough on gouging |first=Andrew |last=Baldock |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=2 July 2009 |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/rugby/IRB-review-signals-intent-to.5421507.jp }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following two high-profile test match incidents, involving [[Schalk Burger]] and [[Sergio Parisse]], during the same week in June 2009, the IRB stated that it would review the sanction structure for this type of offence "in order to send out the strongest possible message that such acts will not be tolerated".&lt;ref name="Scotsman"/&gt;

On 2 October 2010, [[Gavin Quinnell]] of the Welsh regional team [[Scarlets]] suffered an eye injury 30 minutes into a game between Scarlets feeder club [[Llanelli RFC|Llanelli]] and [[Cross Keys RFC|Cross Keys]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4942">'''Didactic organisation''' is the ability of [[neuron]]s within a network to impart their pattern of [[synapse|synaptic connectivity]] and/or [[response properties]] to other neurons. The term didactic is used because this kind of influence is unidirectional; each individual instance of didactic organisation between two connected neurons does not involve a bidirectional transfer of connectivity or response property information between them.

==Experimental and theoretical evidence==
Evidence for didactic organisation ''[[in vivo]]'' was first discovered through research into synaptic reorganisation in primary visual cortex that compared the results of neuronal recording experiments and computational models.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;Young ''et al.'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tendency of [[spike-timing-dependent plasticity]] to separate neurons into ‚Äòteachers‚Äô and ‚Äòstudents‚Äô had previously been predicted in theory based on computational modelling results alone.&lt;ref name=Song&gt;Song and Abbott, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spike-timing-dependent plasticity==
Didactic organisation is primarily a consequence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity, because when the neurons within an interconnected network undergo [[action potentials]] (or ‚Äòspikes‚Äô) at approximately the same time (within the order of tens of milliseconds) the [[Efferent nerve|efferent synaptic connections]] of neurons that spike early will have their efficacy increased ([[long-term potentiation]]), while neurons that spike late will have the efficacy of their efferent synaptic connections decreased ([[long-term depression]]).&lt;ref name=Young/&gt;&lt;ref name=Song/&gt;

==Causal activity==
While spike-timing-dependent plasticity is an essential ingredient for didactic organisation, other features of neuronal activity appear to be required for didactic organisation to occur ''in vivo''. One of these features is that activity propagated through a network needs to have a 'causal' character.&lt;ref name=Young/&gt; For example, chain of reciprocally connected neurons with this ‚Äòcausal activity‚Äô characteristic would be capable of propagating a wave of spikes along its length, rather than the wave disintegrating into a cascade of spikes ‚Äòbouncing‚Äô back and forth between neurons in the chain.

==Activity propagation==
A third important feature for didactic organisation in vivo concerns the spatial scale of spike propagation within a network. While it is expected that didactic organisation will always be present among neurons that exhibit spike timing-dependent plasticity and causal activity (see above), the spatial scale over which didactic organisation can occur between neurons within a network should be limited by the spatial scale of spike propagation. Evidence suggests that the scale of spike propagation can be actively controlled by adjusting the balance of [[excitatory postsynaptic potential|excitation]] and [[inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibition]] within a network (a balance that can be modulated by [[Synaptic plasticity|synaptic scaling]], for example), thus providing a means by which a network can actively control when and to what extent didactic organisation can occur.&lt;ref name=Young/&gt; For this reason, and the very specific connectivity patterns that can be achieved via didactic organisation, it has been speculated that didactic organisation may play an important role in brain development.

In [[philosophy]], '''emergentism''' is the belief in [[emergence]], particularly as it involves [[consciousness]] and the [[philosophy of mind]], and as it contrasts (or not) with [[reductionism]]. A property of a [[system]] is said to be emergent if it is a new outcome of some other properties of the system and their interaction, while it is itself  different from them.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Timothy and Wong, Hong Yu, "Emergent Properties", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/properties-emergent/&gt;.
&lt;/ref&gt; Emergent properties are not identical with, reducible to, or deducible from the other properties. The different ways in which this independence requirement can be satisfied lead to variant types of emergence.

== Forms ==
All varieties of emergentism strive to be compatible with [[physicalism]],{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} the theory that the universe is composed exclusively of physical entities, and in particular with the evidence relating changes in the brain with changes in mental functioning. Many forms of emergentism, including proponents of complex adaptive systems, do not hold a material but rather a relational or processural view of the universe. Furthermore, they view [[mind‚Äìbody dualism]] as a conceptual error insofar as mind and body are merely different types of relationships. As a theory of mind (which it is not always), emergentism differs from [[idealism]], [[eliminative materialism]], [[identity theory of mind|identity theories]], [[neutral monism]], [[panpsychism]], and [[substance dualism]], whilst being closely associated with [[property dualism]]. It is generally not obvious whether an emergent theory of mind embraces [[mental causation]] or must be considered [[epiphenomenal]].

Some varieties of emergentism are not specifically concerned with the [[mind‚Äìbody problem]], and instead suggest a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] or layered view of the whole of nature, with the layers arranged in terms of increasing [[complexity]] with each requiring its own [[special science]]. Typically [[physics]] ([[mathematical physics]], [[particle physics]], and [[classical physics]]) is basic, with [[chemistry]] built on top of it, then [[biology]], [[psychology]], and [[social sciences]]. Reductionists respond that the arrangement of the sciences is a matter of convenience, and that chemistry is derivable from physics (and so forth) ''in principle'', an argument which gained force after the establishment of a quantum-mechanical basis for chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, T. ''The Significance of Emergence''&lt;/ref&gt;

Other varieties see [[mind]] or [[consciousness]] as specifically and anomalously requiring emergentist explanation, and therefore constitute a family of positions in the [[philosophy of mind]]. [[Douglas Hofstadter]] summarises this view as ''"the soul is more than the sum of its parts"''. A number of philosophers have offered the argument that [[qualia]] constitute the [[hard problem of consciousness]], and resist reductive explanation in a way that all other phenomena do not. In contrast, reductionists generally see the task of accounting for the possibly atypical properties of mind and of living things as a matter of showing that, contrary to appearances, such properties are indeed fully accountable in terms of the properties of the basic constituents of nature and therefore in no way genuinely atypical.

Intermediate positions are possible: for instance, some emergentists hold that emergence is neither universal nor restricted to consciousness, but applies to (for instance) living creatures, or [[self-organising]] systems, or [[complex systems]].

Some philosophers hold that emergent properties causally interact with more fundamental levels, an idea known as [[downward causation]]. Others maintain that higher-order properties simply [[supervene]] over lower levels without direct causal interaction.

All the cases so far discussed have been synchronic, i.e. the emergent property exists simultaneously with its basis.
Yet another variation operates diachronically. Emergentists of this type believe that ''genuinely novel properties'' can come into being, without being accountable in terms of the preceding history of the universe. (Contrast with [[indeterminism]] where it is only the ''arrangement or configuration'' of matter that is unaccountable). These evolution-inspired theories often have a [[theological]] aspect, as in the [[process philosophy]] of [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]].

== Relationship to vitalism ==

A refinement of [[vitalism]] may be recognized in contemporary molecular histology in the proposal that some key organising and structuring features of organisms, perhaps including even life itself, are examples of [[emergence|emergent process]]es; those in which a complexity arises, out of interacting chemical processes forming interconnected feedback cycles, that cannot fully be described in terms of those processes since the system as a whole has properties that the constituent reactions lack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schultz | first1 = SG | title = A century of (epithelial) transport physiology: from vitalism to molecular cloning | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 274 | issue = 1 Pt 1 | pages = C13‚Äì23 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9458708 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gilbert | first1 = SF | last2 = Sarkar | first2 = S | title = Embracing complexity: organicism for the 21st century | journal = Developmental Dynamics | volume = 219 | issue = 1 | pages = 1‚Äì9 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10974666 | doi = 10.1002/1097-0177(2000)9999:9999&lt;::AID-DVDY1036&gt;3.0.CO;2-A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether emergent system properties should be grouped with traditional vitalist concepts is a matter of semantic controversy.&lt;ref&gt;see "Emergent Properties" in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. online at [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties-emergent/ Stanford University] for explicit discussion; briefly, some philosophers see emergentism as midway between traditional spiritual vitalism and mechanistic reductionism; others argue that, structurally, emergentism is equivalent to vitalism. See also Emmeche C (2001) Does a robot have an Umwelt? ''Semiotica'' 134: 653-693 [http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/cePubl/2001d.robumwelt.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In a light-hearted millennial vein, Kirshner and Michison call research into integrated cell and organismal physiology ‚Äúmolecular vitalism.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81685-2 | last1 = Kirschner | first1 = M | last2 = Gerhart | first2 = J | last3 = Mitchison | first3 = T | year = 2000 | title = Molecular "vitalism | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 100 | issue = 1| pages = 79‚Äì88 | pmid = 10647933 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Emmeche ''et al.'' (1997):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"On the one hand, many scientists and philosophers regard emergence as having only a pseudo-scientific status. On the other hand, new developments in physics, biology, psychology, and crossdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science, artificial life, and the study of non-linear dynamical systems have focused strongly on the high level 'collective behaviour' of complex systems, which is often said to be truly emergent, and the term is increasingly used to characterize such systems."&lt;ref name ="Emmeche 1997"&gt;Emmeche C (1997) EXPLAINING EMERGENCE:towards an ontology of levels. Journal for General Philosophy of Science [http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/coPubl/97e.EKS/emerg.html available online]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Emmeche ''et al.'' (1998) state that "there is a very important difference between the vitalists and the emergentists: the vitalist's creative forces were relevant only in organic substances, not in inorganic matter. Emergence hence is creation of new properties regardless of the substance involved." "The assumption of an extra-physical vitalis (vital force, [[entelechy]], [[√©lan vital]], etc.), as formulated in most forms (old or new) of vitalism, is usually without any genuine explanatory power. It has served altogether too often as an [[intellectual tranquilizer]] or [[verbal sedative]]‚Äîstifling scientific inquiry rather than encouraging it to proceed in new directions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhicontrib2.cgi?id=dv3-69 Dictionary of the History of Ideas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511191629/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhicontrib2.cgi?id=dv3-69 |date=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===John Stuart Mill===
[[John Stuart Mill]] outlined his version of emergentism in ''[[System of Logic]]'' (1843). Mill argued that the properties of some physical systems, such as those in which [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic forces]] combine to produce simple motions, are subject to a law of nature he called the "[[Composition of Causes]]". According to Mill, emergent properties are not subject to this law, but instead amount to more than the sums of the properties of their parts.

Mill believed that various [[chemical reaction]]s (poorly understood in his time) could provide examples of emergent properties, although some critics believe that modern [[physical chemistry]] has shown that these reactions can be given satisfactory [[reductionist]] explanations. For instance, it has been claimed by Dirac that the whole of chemistry is, in principle,
contained in the [[Schr√∂dinger equation]].&lt;ref&gt;

===C. D. Broad===
British philosopher [[C. D. Broad]] defended a realistic [[epistemology]] in ''[[The Mind and its Place in Nature]]'' (1925) arguing that [[emergent materialism]] is the most likely solution to the mind‚Äìbody problem.

Broad defined emergence as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Put in abstract terms the emergent theory asserts that there are certain wholes, composed (say)
of constituents A, B, and C in a relation R to each other; that all wholes composed of
constituents of the same kind as A, B, and C in relations of the same kind as R have certain
characteristic properties; that A, B, and C are capable of occurring in other kinds of complex
where the relation is not of the same kind as R; and that the characteristic properties of the
whole R(A, B, C) cannot, even in theory, be deduced from the most complete knowledge of
the properties of A, B, and C in isolation or in other wholes which are not of the form R(A, B,
C).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition amounted to the claim that mental properties would count as emergent if and only if [[philosophical zombie]]s were metaphysically possible{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. Many philosophers take this position to be inconsistent with some formulations of [[psychophysical parallelism|psychophysical]] [[supervenience]].

===C. Lloyd Morgan and Samuel Alexander===
[[Samuel Alexander]]'s views on emergentism, argued in ''[[Space, Time, and Deity]]'' (1920), were inspired in part by the ideas in psychologist [[C. Lloyd Morgan]]'s ''[[Emergent evolution|Emergent Evolution]]''. Alexander believed that emergence was fundamentally inexplicable, and that emergentism was simply a "brute empirical fact":

"The higher quality emerges from the lower level of existence and has its roots therein, but it emerges therefrom, and it does not belong to that level, but constitutes its possessor a new order of existent with its special laws of behaviour. The existence of emergent qualities thus described is something to be noted, as some would say, under the compulsion of brute empirical fact, or, as I should prefer to say in less harsh terms, to be accepted with the ‚Äúnatural piety‚Äù of the investigator. It admits no explanation." ([[Space, Time, and Deity]])

Despite the causal and explanatory gap between the phenomena on different levels, Alexander held that emergent qualities were ''not'' [[epiphenomenal]]. His view can perhaps best be described as a form of [[non-reductive physicalism]] (NRP) or [[supervenience]] theory.

=== Ludwig von Bertalanffy ===
[[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] founded [[general system theory]] (GST), which is a more contemporary approach to emergentism. A popularization of many of the elements of GST may be found in ''[[The Web of Life]]'' by [[Fritjof Capra]].

=== Jaegwon Kim ===
[[Image:Figure1.gif|thumb|right|Figure demonstration how M1 and M2 are not reduced to P1 and P2.]]
Addressing emergentism  (under the guise of [[non-reductive physicalism]]) as a solution to the [[mind‚Äìbody problem]] [[Jaegwon Kim]] has raised an objection based on [[causal closure]] and [[overdetermination]].

Emergentism strives to be compatible with physicalism, and physicalism, according to Kim, has a principle of causal closure according to which every physical event is fully accountable in terms of physical causes. This seems to leave no "room"
for [[mental causation]] to operate. If our bodily movements were caused by the preceding state of our bodies ''and'' our decisions and intentions, they would be overdetermined. Mental causation in this sense is not
the same as [[free will]], but is only the claim that mental states are causally relevant. If emergentists respond by abandoning the idea of mental causation, their position becomes a form of [[epiphenomenalism]].

In detail: he proposes (using the chart on the right) that ''M1'' causes ''M2'' (these are mental events) and ''P1'' causes ''P2'' (these are physical events). ''P1'' realises ''M1'' and ''P2'' realises ''M2''. However ''M1'' does not causally effect ''P1'' (i.e., ''M1'' is a [[consequent]] event of ''P1''). If ''P1'' causes ''P2'', and ''M1'' is a result of ''P1'', then ''M2'' is a result of ''P2''. He says that the only alternatives to this problem is to accept [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] (where the mental events are independent of the physical events) or [[eliminativism]] (where the mental events do not exist).&lt;!--Crane and Sperry-http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=11&amp;ved=0CBUQFjAAOAo&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fweb.mac.com%2Fcranetim%2FTims_website%2FOnline_papers_files%2FSignificance%2520of%2520emergence.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=sperry%20emergentism&amp;ei=RKBtTZipM4is8AOZ262RBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHTERxqtuGVtJkSRPN2oLVodix0rw&amp;cad=rja--&gt;

[[File:Termite mound.jpg|thumb|[[Termite]] mound: termites developed eusociality in the [[Jurassic]] period, over 145 million years ago.]]

'''Eusociality''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Œµ·Ωñ ''eu'' "good" and [[social]]), the highest level of organization of [[animal sociality]], is defined by the following characteristics: cooperative [[Offspring|brood]] care (including care of offspring from other individuals), overlapping generations within a colony of adults, and a division of labor into reproductive and non-reproductive groups. The division of labor creates specialized behavioral groups within an animal society which are sometimes called [[castes]]. Eusociality is distinguished from all other social systems because individuals of at least one caste usually lose the ability to perform at least one behavior characteristic of individuals in another caste.

Eusociality exists in certain [[insect]]s, [[crustacean]]s and [[mammal]]s.  It is mostly observed and studied in the [[Hymenoptera]] ([[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s) and in [[termite]]s. A colony has caste differences: queens and reproductive males take the roles of the sole reproducers, while soldiers and workers work together to create a living situation favorable for the brood. In addition to Hymenoptera and Isoptera, there are two known eusocial vertebrates among [[rodent]]s: the [[naked mole-rat]] and the [[Damaraland mole-rat]]. Some [[shrimp]]s, such as ''[[Synalpheus regalis]]'', are also eusocial. [[E. O. Wilson]] has claimed that [[humans]] are eusocial, but his arguments have been disputed by a large number of evolutionary biologists, who note that humans do not have division of reproductive labor.&lt;ref name=Gintis/&gt;

Several other levels of animal sociality have been distinguished. These include [[sociality|presocial (solitary but social), subsocial, and parasocial]] (including communal, quasisocial, and semisocial).

== History ==

[[File:Revisando las larvas de una colmenas.jpg|thumb|Co-operative brood rearing in [[honeybees]]]]

The term "eusocial" was introduced in 1966 by Suzanne Batra who used it to describe nesting behavior in [[Halictinae|Halictine]] bees.&lt;ref name=Crespi1995&gt;{{cite journal | last=Crespi | first=Bernard J. | author-link=Bernard Crespi | author2=Douglas Yanega | title=The Definition of Eusociality | journal=Behav Ecol | year=1995 | volume=6 | pages=109‚Äì115 | doi=10.1093/beheco/6.1.109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Batra1968&gt;{{cite journal | last=Batra | first=Suzanne W. T. | title=Behavior of Some Social and Solitary Halictine Bees Within Their Nests: A Comparative Study (Hymenoptera: Halictidae) | journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society | date=Jan 1968 | volume=41 | issue=1 | pages=120‚Äì133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batra observed the cooperative behavior of the bees, males and females alike, as they took responsibility for at least one duty (i.e. burrowing, cell construction, [[oviposition]]) within the colony. The cooperativeness was essential as the activity of one labor division greatly influenced the activity of another.

For example, the size of [[pollen]] balls, a source of food, depended on when the egg-laying females oviposited. If the provisioning by pollen collectors was incomplete by the time the egg-laying female occupied a cell and oviposited, the size of the pollen balls would be small, leading to small offspring.&lt;ref name=Batra1968 /&gt; Batra applied this term to species in which a colony is started by a single individual. Batra described other species, where the founder is accompanied by numerous helpers‚Äîas in a swarm of bees or ants‚Äîas "hypersocial".

In 1969, [[Charles D. Michener]]&lt;ref name="Michener 1969 299‚Äì342"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Michener | first=Charles D. | title=Comparative Social Behavior of Bees | journal=Annu. Rev. Entomol. | year=1969 | volume=14 | pages=299‚Äì342 | doi=10.1146/annurev.en.14.010169.001503}}&lt;/ref&gt; further expanded Batra‚Äôs classification with his comparative study of social behavior in bees. He observed multiple species of bees ([[Apoidea]]) in order to investigate the different levels of animal sociality, all of which are different stages that a colony may pass through. Eusociality, which is the highest level of animal sociality a species can attain, specifically had three characteristics that distinguished it from the other levels:

# "Egg-layers and worker-like individuals among adult females" (division of labor)
# The overlap of generations (mother and adult offspring)
# Cooperative work on the cells of the bees' honeycomb&lt;ref name="Crespi1995"/&gt;

[[E. O. Wilson]] then extended the terminology to include other social insects; such as ants, wasps, and termites. Originally, it was defined to include organisms (only invertebrates) that had the following three features:&lt;ref name=Crespi1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gadagkar 1993 215‚Äì216"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gadagkar | first=Raghavendra | title=And now... eusocial thrips! | journal=Current Science | year=1993 | volume=64 | issue=4 | pages=215‚Äì216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson_Insect_Societies&gt;{{cite book | last=Wilson | first=Edward O. | title=The Insect Societies | year=1971 | publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location=Cambridge. Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson2005&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wilson | first=Edward O. | author2=Bert H√∂lldobler | title=Eusociality: Origin and Consequences | journal=PNAS | date=20 September 2005 | volume=102 | issue=38 | pages=13367‚Äì13371 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0505858102 | pmid=16157878 | pmc=1224642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Reproductive division of labor (with or without sterile castes)
# Overlapping generations
# Cooperative care of young

As eusociality became a recognized widespread phenomenon, however, it was also discovered in a group of [[Chordata|chordates]], the mole-rats. Further research also distinguished another possibly important criterion for eusociality, known as "the point of no return". This is characterized by eusocial individuals that become fixed into one behavioral group, which usually occurs before reproductive maturity. This prevents them from transitioning between behavioral groups and creates an animal society that is truly dependent on each other for survival and reproductive success. For many insects, this irreversibility has changed the anatomy of the worker caste, which is sterile and provides support for the reproductive caste.&lt;ref name=Crespi1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson2005 /&gt;

== Taxonomic range ==
Most eusocial societies exist in [[arthropod]]s, while a few are found in [[mammal]]s.

=== In insects ===

The order [[Hymenoptera]] contains the largest group of eusocial insects, including [[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s{{mdash}}those with reproductive "queens" and more or less [[infertility|sterile]] "workers" and/or "soldiers" that perform specialized tasks.&lt;ref name=Holldobler1990&gt;{{cite book | last=H√∂lldobler | first=B. | title=The Ants | year=1990 | publisher=Belknap Press | location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the well-studied social wasp ''[[Polistes versicolor]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Polistes wasps and their social parasites: an overview |journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici |date=2006 |volume=43 |issue=5/6 |pages=531‚Äì549 |jstor=23736760}}&lt;/ref&gt; dominant females perform tasks such as building new cells and ovipositing, while subordinate females tend to perform tasks like feeding the larvae and foraging. The task differentiation between castes can be seen in the fact that subordinates complete 81.4% of the total foraging activity, while dominants only complete 18.6% of the total foraging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zara | first1 = Fernando | last2 = Balestieri | first2 = Jose | year = 2000 | title = Behavioural Catalogue of Polistes versicolor Olivier (Vespidae: Polistinae) Post-emergent Colonies | journal = Naturalia | volume = 25 | pages = 301‚Äì19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While only a moderate percentage of species in bees (families [[Apidae]] and [[Halictidae]]) and wasps ([[Crabronidae]] and [[Vespidae]]) are eusocial, nearly all species of ants ([[Formicidae]]) are eusocial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Peters |first=Ralph S. |last2=Krogmann |first2=Lars |last3=Mayer |first3=Christoph |last4=Donath |first4=Alexander |last5=Gunkel|first5=Simon |last6=Meusemann |first6=Karen |last7=Kozlov |first7=Alexey |last8=Podsiadlowski |first8=Lars |last9=Petersen |first9=Malte |date=April 2017 |title=Evolutionary History of the Hymenoptera |journal=Current Biology |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=1013‚Äì1018 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2017.01.027|pmid=28343967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some major lineages within these groups are mostly or entirely eusocial, as well, such as the bee tribes [[Apini]], [[Bombini]], [[Euglossini]], and [[Meliponini]], and the wasp subfamilies [[Polistinae]] and [[Vespinae]]. Eusociality in these families is sometimes managed by a set of [[pheromones]] that alter the behavior of specific castes in the colony. These pheromones may act across different species, as observed in ''[[Apis andreniformis]]'' (black dwarf honey bee), where worker bees responded to queen pheromone from the related ''[[Apis florea]]'' (red dwarf honey bee).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wongvilas | first1 = S. | last2 = Deowanish | first2 = S. | last3 = Lim | first3 = J. | last4 = Xie | first4 = V.

Workers of the Australian stingless bee ''[[Tetragonula carbonaria]]'', for instance, mark food sources with a pheromone, helping their nest mates to find the food.&lt;ref name=Bartareau1996&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartareau, T. |year=1996 |title=Foraging Behaviour of Trigona Carbonaria (Hymenoptera: Apidae) at Multiple-Choice Feeding Stations |journal=Australian Journal of Zoology |volume=44 |issue=2 |doi=10.1071/zo9960143 |pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive specialization generally involves the production of sterile members of the species, which carry out specialized tasks to care for the reproductive members. It can manifest in the appearance of individuals within a group whose behavior or morphology is modified for group defense, including self-sacrificing behavior ("[[Altruism in animals|altruism]]"). An example of a species whose sterile caste displays this altruistic behavior is ''[[Myrmecocystus mexicanus]]'', one of the species of honey ant. Select sterile workers fill their abdomens with liquid food until they become immobile and hang from the ceilings of the underground nests, acting as food storage for the rest of the colony.&lt;ref name="Conway1986"&gt;Conway, John R. "The Biology of Honey Ants." ''The American Biology Teacher'', Vol. 48, No. 6 (Sep., 1986), pp. 335‚Äì343.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all social species of insects have distinct morphological differences between castes. For example, in the Neotropical social wasp ''[[Synoeca surinama]], ''social displays determine the caste ranks of individuals in the developing brood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=The Nature and Evolution of Swarming In Tropical Social Wasps (Vespidae, Polistinae, Polybini) | last=West-Eberhard | first=M. J. | date=1982 | journal=Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; These castes are sometimes further specialized in their behavior based on age. For example,'' [[Scaptotrigona postica]]'' workers assume different roles in the nest based on their age. Between approximately 0‚Äì40 days old, the workers perform tasks within the nest such as provisioning cell broods, colony cleaning, and nectar reception and dehydration. Once older than 40 days, ''[[Scaptotrigona postica]]'' workers move outside of the nest to practice colony defense and foraging.&lt;ref name="Drones 435-447"&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Veen |first=J.W. |author2=Sommeijer, M.

In ''[[Lasioglossum aeneiventre]]'', a halictid bee from Central America, nests may be headed by more than one female; such nests have more cells, and the number of active cells per female is correlated with the number of females in the nest, implying that having more females leads to more efficient building and provisioning of cells.&lt;ref name= "Wcislo2"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wcislo, W.

[[Termite]]s (order [[Blattodea]], infraorder [[Isoptera]]) make up another large portion of highly advanced eusocial animals. The colony is differentiated into various castes: the queen and king are the sole reproducing individuals; workers forage and maintain food and resources;&lt;ref&gt;Costa-Leonardo AM, Haifig I.

Some species of [[gall-inducing insect]]s, including the [[gall]]-forming [[aphid]], ''[[Pemphigus spyrothecae]]'' (order [[Hemiptera]]), and [[thrips]] (order [[Thysanoptera]]), were also described as eusocial.&lt;ref name=Stern1994&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stern | first=D.L. | title=A phylogenetic analysis of soldier evolution in the aphid family Hormaphididae | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society | year=1994 | volume=256 | issue=1346 | pages=203‚Äì209 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1994.0071| pmid=8029243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aoki2005&gt;{{cite journal | last=Aoki | first=S. | author2=Imai, M. | title=Factors affecting the proportion of sterile soldiers in growing aphid colonies | journal=Population Ecology | year=2005 | volume=47 | issue=2 | pages=127‚Äì136 | doi=10.1007/s10144-005-0218-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; These species have very high relatedness among individuals due to their partially [[asexual reproduction|asexual mode of reproduction]] (sterile soldier castes being clones of the reproducing female), but the gall-inhabiting behavior gives these species a defensible resource that sets them apart from related species with similar genetics. They produce soldier castes capable of fortress defense and protection of their colony against both predators and competitors.

=== In crustaceans ===
Eusociality has also arisen three different times among some [[crustacean]]s that live in separate colonies. ''[[Synalpheus regalis]]'', ''[[Synalpheus filidigitus]]'', and ''[[Synalpheus chacei]]'', three species of parasitic shrimp that rely on fortress defense and live in groups of closely related individuals in tropical reefs and sponges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Multiple origins of eusociality among sponge-dwelling shrimps (''Synalpheus'') | first=J. Emmett | last=Duffy | author2=Cheryl L.

As with other eusocial societies, there is a single shared living space for the colony members, and the non-breeding members act to defend it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Bulletin of Marine Science | title=On the frequency of eusociality in snapping shrimps (Decapoda: Alpheidae), with description of a second eusocial species | author=Duffy, J.

The fortress defense hypothesis additionally points out that because sponges provide both food and shelter, there is an aggregation of relatives (because the shrimp do not have to disperse to find food), and much competition for those nesting sites. Being the target of attack promotes a good defense system (soldier caste); soldiers therefore promote the fitness of the whole nest by ensuring safety and reproduction of the queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Duffy | first1=J.E. | title=The ecology and evolution of eusociality in sponge-dwelling shrimp | journal=Genes, Behaviors and Evolution of Social Insects | date=2003 | pages=217‚Äì254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eusociality offers a competitive advantage in shrimp populations. Eusocial species were found to be more abundant, occupy more of the habitat, and use more of the available resources than non-eusocial species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Duffy | first1=J.E. | last2=Macdonald | first2=K.S. | title=Kin structure, ecology and the evolution of social organization in shrimp: a comparative analysis | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | date=2010 | volume=277 | issue=1681 | pages=575‚Äì584 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.1483 | pmid=19889706 | pmc=2842683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hultgren | first1=K.M. | last2=Duffy | first2=J.E. | title=Phylogenetic community ecology and the role of social dominance in sponge-dwelling shrimp | journal=Ecology Letters | date=2012 | volume=15 | issue=7 | pages=704‚Äì713 | doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01788.x| pmid=22548770 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Macdonald | first1=K.S. | last2=Rios | first2=R. | last3=Duffy | first3=J.E. | title=Biodiversity, host specificity, and dominance by eusocial species among sponge-dwelling alpheid shrimp on the Belize Barrier Reef | journal=Diversity and Distributions | date=2006 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=165‚Äì178 | doi=10.1111/j.1366-9516.2005.00213.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies add to these findings by pointing out that cohabitation was more rare than expected by chance, and that most sponges were dominated by one species, which was frequently eusocial.

=== In mammals ===
[[File:Naked mole rat-National Museum of Nature and Science.jpg|thumb|[[Naked mole-rat]], one of two eusocial species in the [[Blesmol|Bathyergidae]]]]

Among mammals, eusociality is known in two species in the [[Blesmol|Bathyergidae]], the [[naked mole-rat]] (''Heterocephalus glaber'') and the [[Damaraland mole-rat]] (''Fukomys damarensis''), both of which are [[diploid]] and highly [[inbred]].&lt;ref name=Burda&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Burda | first1=H.

However, this classification is controversial owing to disputed definitions of 'eusociality'.
To [[inbreeding avoidance|avoid inbreeding]], mole rats sometimes outbreed and establish new colonies when resources are sufficient.&lt;ref name="O'Riain and Faulkes, (2008)"&gt;{{cite book | last1=O'Riain | first1=M.J. | last2=Faulkes | first2=C.

Some mammals in the [[Carnivora]] and [[Primates]] exhibit eusocial tendencies. Perhaps most notable are [[meerkat]]s (''Suricata suricatta'') and [[dwarf mongoose]]s (''Helogale parvula''). These show cooperative breeding and marked reproductive skews. In the dwarf mongoose, the breeding pair receives food priority and protection from subordinates and rarely has to defend against predators.&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Williams, S.A.  |author2=Shattuck, M.R.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2015 |title= Ecology, longevity and naked mole-rats: confounding effects of sociality? |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |volume=282 |issue=1802 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.1664 |pmid=25631992  |pages=20141664|pmc=4344137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In humans===

An early 21st century debate focused on whether humans are [[prosocial]] versus eusocial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Foster |first1 = Kevin R. |last2 = Ratnieks |first2 = Francis L.W. |year = 2005 |title = A new eusocial vertebrate? |url = http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/group/foster/FosterRatnieksTREE2005.pdf |journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume = 20 |issue = 7 |pages = 363‚Äì364 |doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2005.05.005 |pmid = 16701397 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward O. Wilson]], in his controversial&lt;ref name=Gintis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawkins2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pinker2012/&gt; 2012 book, ''The Social Conquest of the Earth'', referred to humans as a species of eusocial ape. He supported his reasoning by stating our eusocial similarities to ants, and by observing that early [[hominins]] cooperated to rear their children while other members of the same group hunted and foraged; he noted that all eusocial species went through just such a stage of collective rearing.&lt;ref name=Gintis/&gt; Humans also fall under some of Wilson's original criteria of eusociality (some kind of division of labor, overlapping generations, and cooperative care of young including ones that are not their own). Wilson argued that through cooperation and teamwork, ants and humans gain a type of "superpower" that is unavailable to other social animals that have failed to make the leap from social to eusocial. In his view, eusociality creates the superorganism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Wilson |first = Edward O. |title = The Social Conquest of Earth |year = 2012 |publisher = Liveright }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson's claims created a vigorous debate.&lt;ref name=Gintis&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Gintis |first1 = Herbert |title = Clash of the Titans.

D. Hamilton]]'s [[inclusive fitness]] theory, formulating instead a controversial theory of [[group selection]]. Wilson's claims, especially as formulated in his 2010 paper with Nowak and Tarnita,&lt;ref name=Nowak2010/&gt; were "vigorously rejected"&lt;ref name=Gintis/&gt; by up to 134 scientists at a time, writing in the same journal, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', as well as by well-known individuals such as [[Richard Dawkins]]&lt;ref name=Dawkins2012&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Dawkins |first1 = Richard |authorlink1 = Richard Dawkins |title = The Descent of Edward Wilson.

Gintis thus agreed with Dawkins that humans are not eusocial, though he suggested some changes to Hamilton's rule to make it more complete.&lt;ref name=Gintis/&gt;

{{Main | Evolution of eusociality}}

=== Phylogenetic distribution ===

Eusociality is a rare but widespread phenomenon in species in at least seven orders in the [[Animal|animal kingdom]], as shown in the [[phylogenetic tree]] (non-eusocial groups not shown). All species of termites are eusocial, and it is believed that they were the first eusocial animals to evolve, sometime in the upper [[Jurassic]] period (~150 million years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Thorne | first1=B.L. | last2=Grimaldi | first2=DA | last3=Krishna | first3=K | editor-last1=Abe | editor-first1=T. | editor-last2=Bignell | editor-first2=D.E | editor-last3=Higashi | editor-first3=M. | title=Termites: evolution, sociality, symbioses, ecology. | publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers | date=January 1, 2001 | origyear=1st.

Thus the number of independent evolutions of eusociality is still under investigation. The major eusocial groups are shown in boldface in the phylogenetic tree.

=== Paradox ===

Prior to the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], eusociality was seen as an apparent evolutionary paradox: if adaptive evolution unfolds by differential reproduction of individual organisms, how can individuals incapable of passing on their genes evolve and persist? In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] referred to the existence of sterile castes as the "one special difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable, and actually fatal to my theory".&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles. ''On the Origin of Species'', 1859. Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin anticipated that a possible resolution to the paradox might lie in the close family relationship, which [[W.D. Hamilton]] quantified a century later with his 1964 [[inclusive fitness]] theory. After the gene-centered view of evolution was developed in the mid 1970s, non-reproductive individuals were seen as an extended phenotype of the genes, which are the primary beneficiaries of natural selection.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Inclusive fitness and haplodiploidy ===
{{further|haplodiploidy}}

According to [[inclusive fitness]] theory, organisms can gain fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output, but also via increasing the reproductive output of other individuals that share their genes, especially their close relatives. Individuals are selected to help their relatives when the cost of helping is less than the benefit gained by their relative multiplied by the fraction of genes that they share, i.e. when ''Cost &lt; relatedness * Benefit''. Under inclusive fitness theory, the necessary conditions for eusociality to evolve are more easily fulfilled by [[haplodiploid]] species because of their unusual relatedness structure.

In [[haplodiploid]] species, females develop from fertilized eggs and males develop from unfertilized eggs. Because a male is haploid, his daughters share 100% of his genes and 50% of their mother's. Therefore, they share 75% of their genes with each other. This mechanism of sex determination gives rise to what W. D. Hamilton first termed "supersisters" which are more related to their sisters than they would be to their own offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hamilton | first=W. D. | title=The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour II | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | date=20 March 1964 | volume=7 | issue=1 | pages=17‚Äì52 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90039-6 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022519364900396 | accessdate=13 November 2012 | pmid=5875340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though workers often do not reproduce, they can potentially pass on more of their genes by helping to raise their sisters than they would by having their own offspring (each of which would only have 50% of their genes). This unusual situation, where females may have greater fitness when they help rear siblings rather than producing offspring, is often invoked to explain the multiple independent evolutions of eusociality (arising at least nine separate times) within the haplodiploid group Hymenoptera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qui√±ones|first=Andr√©s E.|last2=Pen|first2=Ido|date=2017-06-23|title=A unified model of Hymenopteran preadaptations that trigger the evolutionary transition to eusociality|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=8|pages=15920|doi=10.1038/ncomms15920|issn=2041-1723|pmc=5490048|pmid=28643786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all eusocial species are haplodiploid (termites, some snapping shrimps, and mole rats are not). Conversely, many bees are haplodiploid yet are not eusocial, and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males, resulting in a hive of half-sisters that share only 25% of their genes. The association between haplodiploidy and eusociality is below statistical significance.&lt;ref name=Nowak2010/&gt; Haplodiploidy alone is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Edward O.|date=2008-01-01|title=One Giant Leap: How Insects Achieved Altruism and Colonial Life|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/58/1/17/233334|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=58|issue=1|pages=17‚Äì25|doi=10.1641/b580106|issn=1525-3244}}&lt;/ref&gt; However relatedness does still play a part, as monogamy (queens mating singly) has been shown to be the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=William O.

=== Ecology ===

Many scientists citing the close phylogenetic relationships between eusocial and non-eusocial species are making the case that environmental factors are especially important in the evolution of eusociality. The relevant factors primarily involve the distribution of food and predators.

Increased parasitism and predation rates are the primary ecological drivers of social organization. Group living affords colony members defense against enemies, specifically predators, parasites, and competitors, and allows them to gain advantage from superior foraging methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Edward O.|last2=H√∂lldobler|first2=Bert|date=2005-09-20|title=Eusociality: Origin and consequences|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/102/38/13367|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|language=en|volume=102|issue=38|pages=13367‚Äì13371|doi=10.1073/pnas.0505858102|issn=0027-8424|pmid=16157878|pmc=1224642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of some aphids, all eusocial species live in a communal nest which provides both shelter and access to food resources. Mole rats and ants live in underground burrows; wasps, bees, and some termites build above-ground hives; thrips and aphids inhabit galls (neoplastic outgrowths) induced on plants; ambrosia beetles and some termites nest together in dead wood; and snapping shrimp inhabit crevices in marine sponges. For many species the habitat outside the nest is often extremely arid or barren, creating such a high cost to dispersal that the chance to take over the colony following parental death is greater than the chance of dispersing to form a new colony. Defense of such fortresses from both predators and competitors often favors the evolution of non-reproductive soldier castes, while the high costs of nest construction and expansion favor non-reproductive worker castes.

The importance of ecology is supported by evidence such as experimentally induced reproductive division of labor, for example when normally solitary queens are forced together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cahan, S. H.  |author2=Gardner-Morse, E. | title=The emergence of reproductive division of labor in forced queen groups of the ant Pogonomyrmex barbatus | journal=Journal of Zoology | volume=291 | issue=1 | pages=12‚Äì22 | year=2013 | doi=10.1111/jzo.12071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, female [[Damaraland mole-rat]]s undergo hormonal changes that promote dispersal after periods of high rainfall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Molteno, A. J. |author2=Bennett, N. C. | title=Rainfall, dispersal and reproductive inhibition in eusocial Damaraland mole-rats (Cryptomys damarensis) | journal=Journal of Zoology | volume=256 |issue=4 | pages=445‚Äì448 | year=2002 | doi=10.1017/s0952836902000481}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting the plasticity of eusocial traits in response to environmental cues.

Climate also appears to be a selective agent driving social complexity; across bee lineages and Hymenoptera in general, higher forms of sociality are more likely to occur in tropical than temperate environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toth|first=A. L.|last2=Robinson|first2=G. E.|date=2009-01-01|title=Evo-Devo and the Evolution of Social Behavior: Brain Gene Expression Analyses in Social Insects|url=http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/74/419|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology|language=en|volume=74|pages=419‚Äì426|doi=10.1101/sqb.2009.74.026|issn=0091-7451|pmid=19850850}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, social transitions within Halictidae bees, where eusociality has been gained and lost multiple times, are correlated with periods of climatic warming. Social behavior in facultative social bees is often reliably predicted by ecological conditions, and switches in behavioral type have been experimentally induced by translocating offspring of solitary or social populations to warm and cool climates. In ''H. rubicundus'', solitary females produce a single brood in cooler regions and social females produce two broods in warmer regions. In another species of sweat bees, ''L. calceatum'', social phenotype has been predicted by altitude and micro-habitat composition, with social nests found in warmer, sunnier sites, and solitary nests found in adjacent, cooler, shaded locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shell|first=Wyatt A.|last2=Rehan|first2=Sandra M.|date=2017-07-24|title=Behavioral and genetic mechanisms of social evolution: insights from incipiently and facultatively social bees|journal=Apidologie|language=en|pages=1‚Äì18|doi=10.1007/s13592-017-0527-1|issn=0044-8435|volume=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multilevel selection ===
{{further|Group selection}}

Once pre-adaptations such as group formation, nest building, high cost of dispersal, and morphological variation are present, [[group selection|between-group competition]] has been cited as a quintessential force in the transition to advanced eusociality. Because the hallmarks of eusociality will produce an extremely altruistic society, such groups will out-reproduce their less cooperative competitors, eventually eliminating all non-eusocial groups from a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Nowak | first1=M. A. | last2=Tarnita | first2=C. E. | last3=Wilson | first3=E. O. | title=The evolution of eusociality | journal=Nature | date=2010 | volume=466 | issue=7310 | pages=1057‚Äì1062 | doi=10.1038/nature09205 | pmid=20740005 | pmc=3279739}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multilevel selection has however been heavily criticized by some for its conflict with the [[kin selection]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Abbot, Patrick  | title=Inclusive fitness theory and eusociality | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=471 | issue=7339 | pages=E1‚ÄìE4 | year=2011 | doi=10.1038/nature09831 | pmid=21430721 | display-authors=etal | pmc=3836173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reversal to solitarity ===

A reversal to solitarity is an evolutionary phenomenon in which descendants of a eusocial group evolve solitary behavior once again. Bees have been model organisms for the study of reversal to solitarity, because of the diversity of their social systems. Each of the four origins of eusociality in bees was followed by at least one reversal to solitarity, giving a total of at least nine reversals.&lt;ref name="Michener 1969 299‚Äì342"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gadagkar 1993 215‚Äì216"/&gt; This suggests that eusociality is costly to maintain, and can only persist when ecological variables favor it. Disadvantages of eusociality include the cost of investing in non-reproductive offspring, and an increased risk of disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zara, Fernando |author2=Balestieri, Jose |title=Behavioural Catalogue of Polistes versicolor Olivier (Vespidae: Polistinae) Post-emergent Colonies |journal=Naturalia |volume=25 |year=2000 |pages=301‚Äì319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All reversals to solitarity have occurred among primitively eusocial groups; none have followed the emergence of advanced eusociality. The "point of no return" hypothesis posits that the morphological differentiation of reproductive and non-reproductive castes prevents highly eusocial species such as the honeybee from reverting to the solitary state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wongvilas, S. |author2=Deowanish, S |author3=Lim, J. |author4=Xie, V. R. D. |author5=Griffith, O. W. |author6=Oldroyd, B. P. |year=2010 |title=Interspecific and conspecific colony mergers in the dwarf honey bees ''Apis andreniformis'' and ''A. florea'' |journal=Insectes Sociaux |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=251‚Äì255 |doi=10.1007/s00040-010-0080-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiological and developmental mechanisms ==

An understanding of the physiological causes and consequences of the eusocial condition has been somewhat slow; nonetheless, major advancements have been made in learning more about the mechanistic and developmental processes that lead to eusociality.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fletcher | first=D. | author2=Ross K. | title=Regulation of Reproduction in Eusocial Hymenoptera | journal=Annual Review of Entomology | year=1985 | volume=30 | pages=319‚Äì343 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.30.1.319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Involvement of pheromones ===

[[Pheromones]] are thought to play an important role in the physiological mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of eusociality. In fact the evolution of enzymes involved both in the production and perception of pheromones has been shown to be important for the emergence of eusociality both within termites and in Hymenoptera.&lt;ref name="Harrison2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=Mark C.|last2=Jongepier|first2=Evelien|last3=Robertson|first3=Hugh M.|last4=Arning|first4=Nicolas|last5=Bitard-Feildel|first5=Tristan|last6=Chao|first6=Hsu|last7=Childers|first7=Christopher P.|last8=Dinh|first8=Huyen|last9=Doddapaneni|first9=Harshavardhan|last10=Dugan|first10=Shannon|last11=Gowin|first11=Johannes|last12=Greiner|first12=Carolin|last13=Han|first13=Yi|last14=Hu|first14=Haofu|last15=Hughes|first15=Daniel S.

Queen mandibular glands were found to produce a mixture of five compounds, three [[aliphatic]] and two [[aromatic]], which have been found to control workers.&lt;ref name=Vargo1999&gt;{{cite journal | last=Vargo | first=E. | title=Reproductive development and ontogeny or queen pheromone production in the fire ant ''Solenopsis invicta'' | journal=Physiological Entomology | year=1999 | volume=24 | issue=4 | pages=370‚Äì376 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-3032.1999.00153.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandibular gland extracts inhibit workers from constructing queen cells in which new queens are reared which can delay the hormonally based behavioral development of workers and can suppress ovarian development in workers.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vargo1999 /&gt; Both behavioral effects mediated by the nervous system often leading to recognition of queens ([[Pheromone#Releaser|releaser]]) and physiological effects on the reproductive and endocrine system ([[Pheromone#Primer|primer]]) are attributed to the same pheromones. These pheromones volatilize or are deactivated within thirty minutes, allowing workers to respond rapidly to the loss of their queen.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt;

The levels of two of the aliphatic compounds increase rapidly in virgin queens within the first week after [[eclosion]] (emergence from the pupal case), which is consistent with their roles as sex attractants during the mating flight.&lt;ref name=Vargo1999 /&gt; It is only after a queen is mated and begins laying eggs, however, that the full blend of compounds is made.&lt;ref name=Vargo1999 /&gt; The physiological factors regulating reproductive development and pheromone production are unknown.

In several ant species, reproductive activity has also been associated with pheromone production by queens.&lt;ref name=Vargo1999 /&gt; In general, mated egg laying queens are attractive to workers whereas young winged virgin queens, which are not yet mated, elicit little or no response. However, very little is known about when pheromone production begins during the initiation of reproductive activity or about the physiological factors regulating either reproductive development or queen pheromone production in ants.&lt;ref name=Vargo1999 /&gt;

Among ants, the queen pheromone system of the fire ant ''[[Solenopsis invicta]]'' is particularly well studied. Both releaser and primer pheromones have been demonstrated in this species. A queen recognition (releaser) hormone is stored in the poison sac along with three other compounds. These compounds were reported to elicit a behavioral response from workers. Several primer effects have also been demonstrated. Pheromones initiate reproductive development in new winged females, called female sexuals.&lt;ref name=Vargo1999 /&gt; These chemicals also inhibit workers from rearing male and female sexuals, suppress egg production in other queens of multiple queen colonies and cause workers to execute excess queens.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vargo1999 /&gt; The action of these pheromones together maintains the eusocial phenotype which includes one queen supported by sterile workers and sexually active males ([[Drone (bee)|drones]]). In queenless colonies that lack such pheromones, winged females will quickly shed their wings, develop ovaries and lay eggs. These virgin replacement queens assume the role of the queen and even start to produce queen pheromones.&lt;ref name=Vargo1999 /&gt; There is also evidence that queen weaver ants ''[[Oecophylla longinoda]]'' have a variety of [[exocrine]] glands that produce pheromones, which prevent workers from laying reproductive eggs.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt;

Similar mechanisms are used for the eusocial wasp species ''[[Vespula vulgaris]]''. In order for a ''Vespula vulgaris'' queen to dominate all the workers, usually numbering more than 3000 in a colony, she exerts pheromone to signal her dominance. The workers were discovered to regularly lick the queen while feeding her, and the air-borne [[pheromone]] from the queen's body alerts those workers of her dominance.&lt;ref name= "Carpenter"&gt;{{Cite journal | url= | title=Phylogenetic relationships and classification of the Vespinae (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) | last=Carpenter | first=J.M | date=1987 | journal=Systematic Entomology | doi=10.1111/j.1365-3113.1987.tb00213.x | pmid= | pages=413‚Äì431 | volume=12| issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mode of action of inhibitory pheromones which prevent the development of eggs in workers has been convincingly demonstrated in the bumble bee ''[[Bombus terrestris]]''.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; In this species, pheromones suppress activity of the [[corpora allata]] and [[juvenile hormone]] (JH) secretion. The corpora allata is an endocrine gland that produces JH, a group of hormones that regulate many aspects of insect physiology.&lt;ref name=Feyereisen1981&gt;{{cite journal | last=Feyereisen | first=R. | author2=Tobe S. | title=A rapid partition assay for routine analysis of juvenile hormone released by insect corpora allata | journal=Analytical Biochemistry | year=1981 | volume=111 | issue=2 | pages=372‚Äì375 | doi=10.1016/0003-2697(81)90575-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; With low JH, eggs do not mature. Similar inhibitory effects of lowering JH were seen in halictine bees and polistine wasps, but not in honey bees.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt;

=== Other strategies ===

A variety of strategies in addition to the use of pheromones have evolved that give the queens of different species of social insects a measure of reproductive control over their nest mates.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; In many [[Polistes]] wasp colonies, monogamy is established soon after colony formation by physical dominance interactions among foundresses of the colony including biting, chasing and food soliciting.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; Such interactions created a dominance hierarchy headed by individuals with the greatest ovarian development.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; Larger, older individuals often have an advantage during the establishment of dominance hierarchies.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; The rank of subordinates is positively correlated with the degree of ovarian development and the highest ranking individual usually becomes queen if the established queen disappears.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; Workers do not [[oviposit]] when queens are present because of a variety of reasons: colonies tend to be small enough that queens can effectively dominate workers, queens practice selective [[oophagy]] or egg eating, or the flow of nutrients favors queen over workers and queens rapidly lay eggs in new or vacated cells.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; However, it is also possible that morphological differences favor the worker. In certain species of wasps, such as ''[[Apoica flavissima]]'' queens are smaller than their worker counterparts. This can lead to interesting worker-queen dynamics, often with the worker policing queen behaviors. Other wasps, like ''[[Polistes instabilis]]'' have workers with the potential to develop into reproductives, but only in cases where there are no queens to suppress them.

In primitively eusocial bees (where castes are morphologically similar and colonies usually small and short-lived), queens frequently nudge their nest mates and then burrow back down into the nest.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; This behavior draws workers into the lower part of the nest where they may respond to stimuli for cell construction and maintenance.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; Being nudged by the queen may play a role in inhibiting ovarian development and this form of queen control is supplemented by oophagy of worker laid eggs.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; Furthermore, temporally discrete production of workers and gynes (actual or potential queens) can cause size dimorphisms between different castes as size is strongly influenced by the season during which the individual is reared. In many wasp species worker caste determination is characterized by a temporal pattern in which workers precede non-workers of the same generation.&lt;ref name=Hunt2010&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hunt | first=J. | author2=Wolschin F. | author3=Henshaw M. | author4=Newman T. | author5=Toth A. | author6=Amdam G. | title=Differential gene expression and protein abundance evince ontogenetic bias toward castes in a primitively eusocial wasp | journal=PLOS ONE | date=17 May 2010 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010674 | volume=5 | issue=5 | pages=e10674 | pmid=20498859 | pmc=2871793}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, for example in the bumble bee, queen control weakens late in the season and the ovaries of workers develop to an increasing extent.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; The queen attempts to maintain her dominance by aggressive behavior and by eating worker laid eggs; her aggression is often directed towards the worker with the greatest ovarian development.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt;

In highly eusocial wasps (where castes are morphologically dissimilar), both the quantity and quality of food seem to be important for caste differentiation.&lt;ref name=Fletcher1985 /&gt; Recent studies in wasps suggest that differential larval nourishment may be the environmental trigger for larval divergence into one of two developmental classes destined to become either a worker or a gyne.&lt;ref name=Hunt2010 /&gt; All honey bee larvae are initially fed with [[royal jelly]], which is secreted by workers, but normally they are switched over to a diet of pollen and honey as they mature; if their diet is exclusively royal jelly, however, they grow larger than normal and differentiate into queens. This jelly seems to contain a specific protein, designated as royalactin, which increases body size, promotes ovary development and shortens the developmental time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kamakura | first=Masaki | title=Royalactin induces queen differentiation in honeybees | journal=Nature | date=May 2011 | volume=473 | pages=478‚Äì483 | doi=10.1038/nature10093 | pmid=21516106 | issue=7348| hdl=2123/10940 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the differential expression in ''Polistes'' of larval genes and proteins (also differentially expressed during queen versus caste development in honey bees) indicate that regulatory mechanisms may occur very early in development.&lt;ref name=Hunt2010 /&gt;

== Definition debates ==
[[Image:AntsStitchingLeave.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Weaver ants]], here collaborating to pull nest leaves together, can be considered primitively eusocial, as they do not have permanent division of labor.]]

Subsequent to Edward O. Wilson's original definition, other authors have sought to narrow or expand the definition of eusociality by focusing on the nature and degree of the division of labor, which was not originally specified. A narrower and more widely accepted definition specifies the requirement for irreversibly distinct behavioral groups or castes (with respect to sterility and/or other features). Such a definition, however, excludes social [[vertebrate]]s, like the mole rats, and some Hymenoptera species, like the [[weaver ants]].&lt;ref name=Crespi1995 /&gt;

For example, depending on the availability of resources and the condition of the environment, mole rats can change between different types of social behaviors.&lt;ref name="O'Riain and Faulkes, (2008)"/&gt; In 2005, according to Wilson and H√∂lldobler, these types of animals would be considered primitively eusocial, which is different from eusocial, since the labor division is not permanent.&lt;ref name=Wilson2005 /&gt; A broader definition, on the other hand, would include mole rats because it allows for any temporary division of labor or non-random distribution of reproductive success to constitute eusociality.

In 2010, [[Martin Nowak|Nowak]], Tarnita and Wilson challenged the theoretical explanation of the evolution of eusociality. Based on the concept of [[inclusive fitness]], the [[kin selection]] theory considers the relatedness of individuals to be one of the most important factors that lead to eusociality. This brought up issues like the irrelevance of haplodiploidy and maternal control. Nowak et al. argued that the kin selection theory is inadequate because it can explain only a subset of eusocial populations due to its assumptions (i.e. "all interactions must be additive and pairwise" which excludes any interaction that involves more than two players). To them, the standard natural selection theory, which is a more general approach than the current explanation of eusociality, is the appropriate theory to use since it explains the same phenomenon and it would work for a larger number of eusocial cases. It also requires simpler mathematical calculations when explaining the evolution of eusociality.&lt;ref name=Nowak2010&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nowak | first=Martin | author2=Corina Tarnita | author3=Wilson, Edward O. | title=The evolution of eusociality | journal=Nature | date=26 August 2010 | volume=466 | pmid=20740005 | issue=7310 | pages=1057‚Äì1062 | doi=10.1038/nature09205 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v466/n7310/full/nature09205.html | pmc=3279739}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/08/kin-selection-challenged/2/ |title=Kin Selection Challenged |publisher=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper led to a large influx of publications that refuted Nowak et al.'s ideas and supported the validity and specificity of the kin selection theory.&lt;ref name=Gintis/&gt; Among these, Trivers and Hare studied the haplodiploid Hymenoptera, finding that the workers were able to win the parent-offspring conflict, countering the parents' best interest and selecting the outcome that has the greater benefit for the workers (i.e. reproductive success with higher relatedness to workers than the queen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Trivers | first=R. L. | author2=Hare, H. | title=Haploidploidy and the Evolution of the Social Insect | journal=Science | date=23 January 1976 | volume=191 | issue=4224 | pages=249‚Äì263 | doi=10.1126/science.1108197 | pmid=1108197}}&lt;/ref&gt; This refuted Nowak et al.'s defense that future offspring development could be based solely on the fitness of parents.

'''''Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever''''' ([[Rodale Books]], {{ISBN|1-57954-954-3}}), published in 2004, is a book authored by [[Raymond Kurzweil|Ray Kurzweil]] and Terry Grossman. The basic premise of the book is that if [[middle age]]d people can live long enough, until approximately 120, they will be able to [[immortality|live forever]]‚Äîas humanity overcomes all [[disease]]s and [[old age]] itself. This might also be considered a [[break-even]] scenario where developments made during a year increase [[life expectancy]] by more than one year. Biogerontologist [[Aubrey de Grey]] called this the "[[Longevity escape velocity]]" in a 2005 [[TED talk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/aubrey_de_grey_says_we_can_avoid_aging.html TED Talks - Aubrey de Grey says we can avoid aging]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book focuses primarily on health topics such as [[heart disease]], [[cancer]], and [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]]. It promotes lifestyle changes such as a low [[glycemic index]] [[dieting|diet]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://womenshealth.about.com/od/fitnessandhealth/a/exfantasticvoya.htm Excerpt from ''Fantastic Voyage''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202192822/http://womenshealth.about.com/od/fitnessandhealth/a/exfantasticvoya.htm |date=2010-12-02 }}  ''About.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[calorie restriction]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://womenshealth.about.com/od/fitnessandhealth/a/exfantasticvoya_4.htm Excerpt from ''Fantastic Voyage''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203114217/http://womenshealth.about.com/od/fitnessandhealth/a/exfantasticvoya_4.htm |date=2010-12-03 }}  ''About.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[exercise]], drinking [[green tea]] and [[water ionizer|alkalinized water]], and other changes to daily living. They also promote aggressive [[dietary supplement|supplementation]]&lt;ref name="fantastic"&gt;[http://www.fantastic-voyage.net/ShortGuidehtml.htm "A Short Guide to a Long Life" (Excerpt from ''Fantastic Voyage'').] ''Fantastic-voyage.net''.&lt;/ref&gt; to make up for nutrient deficiencies they believe are common in [[Western culture|Western society]].  In contrast to his previous book ''[[The 10% Solution for a Healthy Life]]'', in which he recommended a diet with 10% of calories from fat, in this book, Kurzweil recommends consuming less than one third of calories from carbohydrates (and less than one sixth of calories in his low-carbohydrate diet) and consuming 25% of calories from fat.&lt;ref name="fantastic" /&gt;

The book states that the purpose of these changes is to obtain and maintain idyllic health so that an individual can extend his or her life as long as possible. The authors believe that within the next 20 to 50 years technology will advance to the point where much of the [[senescence|aging process]] will be conquered, and [[degenerative diseases]] eliminated. The book is peppered with side notes on these futuristic topics, showing how current research is leading us toward [[life extension]], and explaining how future technologies such as [[nanotechnology]] and [[bioengineering]] might change the way humans live their lives. Ray Kurzweil discusses these topics at further length in his 2005 book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]''.

A follow-up on ''Fantastic Voyage'', ''Transcend: Nine Steps to Living Well Forever'', was released on April 28, 2009.

==Criticisms==
One claim in the book has been called pseudoscience. Dr. Stephen Lower, retired Professor of Chemistry at Simon Fraser University, disputes some of the book's statements about alkaline water on his [http://www.chem1.com/CQ/ionbunk.html web site]. Kurzweil and Grossman counter this specific criticism directly in their [http://www.fantastic-voyage.net/ReaderQandA.htm#alkaline Reader Q&amp;A].

The endonuclease activity of FENs was initially identified as acting on a DNA duplex which has a single-stranded 5' overhang on one of the strands (termed a "5' flap", hence the name flap endonuclease).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8131753 |year=1994 |last1=Harrington |first1=John J. |last2=Lieber |first2=Michael R. |title=The characterization of a mammalian DNA structure-specific endonuclease |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=1235‚Äì46 |pmc=394933 |journal=The EMBO Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; FENs catalyse hydrolytic cleavage of the [[phosphodiester bond]] at the junction of single- and double-stranded DNA. FENs can also act as 5'-3' exonucleases on the 5' terminus of the flap strand and on 'nicked' [[DNA]] [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]s.

[[Protein structure]] models based on [[X-ray crystallography]] data suggest that FENs have a flexible arch created by two Œ±-helices through which the single 5' strand of the 5' flap structure can thread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/382090a0 |title=A helical arch allowing single-stranded DNA to thread through T5 5'-exonuclease |year=1996 |last1=Ceska |first1=T.

Flap endonucleases have been used in [[biotechnology]], for example the Taqman [[PCR]] assay &lt;ref&gt;http://www.med.unc.edu/anclinic/Tm.htm{{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Invader [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) assay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2004.08.016 |title=The Invader¬Æ assay for SNP genotyping |year=2005 |last1=Olivier |first1=Michael |journal=Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis |volume=573 |pmid=15829241 |pages=103‚Äì10 |issue=1‚Äì2 |pmc=2771639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genealogy book|Genealogy registers]], of families, maintained by [[Brahmin]] [[Pandits]] (Priests) or ‚ÄòPandas‚Äô, who double up as professional [[genealogy|genealogists]], at [[Haridwar]], has been a subject of study for many years now.&lt;ref name=bha&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OsI7Hy8H34YC&amp;pg=RA1-PA151&amp;lpg=RA1-PA151&amp;dq=Hindu+genealogy+registers+at+Haridwar&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ihYBQhUcK7&amp;sig=Uj_vt0bcEjfEMqm80cKzJki45bU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result Brahman pandas] ''Divine Enterprise: Gurus and the Hindu Nationalist Movement'', by Lise McKean, University of Chicago Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-226-56010-4}}. Page 151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=janam&gt;[http://www.globalsikhstudies.net/pdf/janamsakhi.pdf Janasakhi] [[Janamsakhis]] of ''Miharban'' and ''Mani Singh'', Janamsakhi Tradition, Dr. Kirpal Singh, 2004, Punjabi University, Patiala. {{ISBN|81-7205-311-8}}. www.globalsikhstudies.net.''page 169''.&lt;/ref&gt; In several cases, these voluminous records or ''Vahis'' (Bahi), have also been used in settling legal cases regarding inheritance or property disputes, as these records are held sacrosanct both by the pilgrims and the Pandas themselves,&lt;ref name=bha/&gt; and in many places these records trace [[family history]], for over twenty prior generations, stretching across many centuries.&lt;ref name=dis&gt;[http://www.dispatchesfromthevanishingworld.com/pastdispatches/mountain/mountain_printer.html Reporter at Large, The Mountain of Names] The New Yorker, 13 May 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1985/05/13/1985_05_13_051_TNY_CARDS_000341255 | first=Alex | last=Shoumatoff | title=The mountain of names | work=[[The New Yorker]] | date=13 May 1985 | page=51 | accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Haridwar has traditionally been a site, for [[Death customs|death rites]] and also [[Shraaddha]], amongst [[Hindu]]s, it soon also became customary for the family pandits (priest) to record each visit of the family, along with their [[gotra]], family tree, marriages and members present etc., grouped according to family and home town. And over the centuries, these registers became an important genealogical source for many families, part of splintered families, in tracing their [[family tree]] and [[family history]] as well, especially after the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, and later amongst the Indian [[diaspora]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/travel/1998/apr/09kumbh1.htm The Greatest Mela on Earth, the Kumbh at Haridwar] ''[[Rediff.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/whodoyouthinkyouare/past-stories/meera-syal.shtml Haridwar genealogy registers or ''Vahi'' (Bahi) at BBC] ''[[BBC]]'', "[[Meera Syal]]'' traced her family tree at Haridwar"...&lt;/ref&gt;

This custom is similar to [[Panjis]] or Panji Prabandh, the extensive genealogical records maintained among [[Maithil Brahmins]] in [[Bihar]].

==Overview==
This custom not well known today to [[demographics of India|Indians]] settled abroad, in an ancient custom detailed family [[genealogy|genealogies]] of Hindu families for the past several generations are kept by professional [[Hindu]] [[Brahmin]] [[Pandits]], popularly known as ''Pandas'', at the Hindu holy city of [[Haridwar]] in hand written registers passed down to them over generations by their Pandit ancestors which are classified according to original [[district]]s and villages of ones ancestors, with special designated Pandit families being in charge of designated district registers, even for cases where ancestral districts and villages that have been left behind in [[Pakistan]] after [[Partition of India]] with Hindus having to migrate to India.

[[File:Haridwar from opposite bank of the Ganges, 1866.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Haridwar]], a site for Hindu pilgrimage, 1866 photograph.]]
In several cases present day descedents are now [[Sikhs]], [[Muslims]] and [[Christians]]. It is not uncommon for one to find details of up to or even more than one's past seven generations in these genealogy registers kept by the ''Pandas of Haridwar''.

For centuries when Hindu ancestors visited the holy town of Haridwar for any purpose which may have mostly been for [[pilgrimage]] purposes or/and for [[cremation]] of their dead or for immersion of ashes and bones of their [[family|kin]] after cremation into the waters of the holy river [[Ganges]] as required by Hindu religious custom, it has been an ancient custom to go to the Pandit who is in charge of ones family register and update the family's genealogical [[family tree]] with details of all marriages, births and deaths from ones extended joint family.

In present day India people visiting Haridwar are dumbfounded when Pundits out of the blue solicit them to come and update their very own ancestral genealogical family tree, news travels like wildfire among the Pandits with ones family's designated Pandit being quickly notified of ones visit. Nowadays with [[Hindu joint family]] system having broken down with people preferring more [[nuclear families]], record keeping Pandits prefer visitors to Haridwar to come prepared after getting in touch with all of ones extended family and bringing all relevant details regarding ones ancestral district and village, names of grand parents and great grand parents and marriages, births and deaths that have occurred in the extended family, even with as much details as possible of the families married into. A visiting family member is required to personally sign the family genealogical register furnished by ones ''Family Panda'' after updating it for future family visitors and generations to see and to authenticate the updated entries, friends and other family members accompanying on the visit may also be requested to sign as witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/India,_Hindu_Pilgrimage_Records_(FamilySearch_Historical_Records)|title=India, Hindu Pilgrimage Records (FamilySearch Historical Records) Genealogy - FamilySearch Wiki|website=familysearch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Records on Microfilm==
Starting around 1977,&lt;ref name=dis/&gt; Hindu genealogy records were [[microfilm]]ed, and later housed at the [[Genealogical Society of Utah]] (GSU), USA since 1981, other places in these records having records of Hindu families are [[Kurukshetra]], [[Pehowa]], [[Chintpurni]], Jawalapur in Haridwar, and [[Jawalamukhi]] &lt;ref name=gen1&gt;[http://www.gensocietyofutah.org/country.asp?countryid=408 India] ''[[Genealogical Society of Utah]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gen2&gt;[http://www.overseasindian.in/2007/dec/news/20072712-183237.shtml Tracing your Asian roots] www.overseasindian.in.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gen3&gt;[http://www.movinghere.org.uk/galleries/roots/asian/countries/lds.htm Hindu Pilgrimage Marriage Records] ''www.movinghere.org.uk''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Genealogical Society of Utah]] currently restricts online access to the Hindu genealogy records to members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and others.&lt;ref name=gen4&gt;[https://www.indiatimes.com/culture/travel/10-places-across-the-world-that-help-you-trace-your-ancestors-249825.html 10 Places Across The World That Help You Trace Your Ancestors], India Times, 29 Jan 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Hindu genealogy registers==
Some notable places where [[Shraadhs]] are performed for the [[Pitrs]] are noted below. At these sites, it became customary for the family pandits (priest) to record each visit of the family, along with their [[gotra]], family tree, marriages and members present etc., grouped according to family and home town.

'''Huis te Warmelo''' was a [[The netherlands|Dutch]] [[frigate]] that struck rocks and sank in the [[Gulf of Finland]] near the [[Kalb√•dagrundin lighthouse]] off the coast of [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] with the loss of all 130 crew on board.&lt;ref name=ERM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20160314_02182297 |title="Vrijwel intact" Nederlands schip uit Gouden Eeuw gevonden |publisher=nieuwsblad.be |date=14 March 2016 |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
''Huis te Warmelo'' was built in [[Medemblik]], [[The netherlands|The Netherlands]] by Blauwevlag, Cornelis Willemszoon in 1708 as a war ship for the [[Admiralty of the Noorderkwartier]]. It was equipped with 3 masts and 40-44 cannons. The ship was {{convert|38.1|m|ftin}} long, with a beam of {{convert|10.8|m|ftin}} and a depth of {{convert|4.7|m|ftin}}.&lt;ref name=URM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?247583 |title=Huis te Warmelo (+1715) |publisher=wrecksite.eu |date=22 November 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sinking ==
On 25 August 1715 ''Huis te Warmelo'' was on a voyage with 130 crew on board and equipped with 40-44 cannons, when it struck the submerged rocks Nannings Rutzen in the [[Gulf of Finland]] near the [[Kalb√•dagrundin lighthouse]] off the coast of [[Porvoo]], [[Finland]] and was taking on water rapidly before it sank when it reached deeper waters. All 130 crew members lost their lives in the disaster and the Dutch navy marked a cross on a map on the location of the sinking with the inscription: ''Hier is het Noord-Hollands oorlogschip op gebleven 1715'', translated to:''Here is where the North-Hollands war ship stayed 1715'' &lt;ref name=ASM&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.medemblik.nl/Bestuur_en_organisatie/Actueel_in_Medemblik/Nieuwsberichten/Maart_2016/Yes_we_have_found_your_ship |title=Yes, we have found your ship! |publisher=medemblik.nl |date=March 2016 |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wreck ==
The wreck was discovered at a depth of {{convert|62|m|ftin}} by the [[Finland|Finnish]] Navy in 2005. It was in a perfect state and laid upright on the sea floor. Even a part of one of the 3 masts was still standing and some cannons were still in position on the wooden deck. The wreck is so well preserved because of the environment with mainly the low salinity, cold temperatures and little oxygen in the water at this depth playing a part in making sure the wooden hull of the ship stayed in good condition.

The ship was only identified in 2015 after a historian found the map on which the Dutch navy had marked the wreck site and it was discovered that only one Dutch war ship had sunk that year, the ''Huis te Warmelo''. The ship hit media attention in March 2016 when it was revealed that the unknown ship had a name and in what condition it was found in. She is the best preserved Dutch Navy ship found to this day and further investigation will be done on the wreck.&lt;ref name=ESM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/961/Wetenschap/article/detail/2646488/2016/03/14/Uniek-Nederlands-schip-uit-Gouden-Eeuw-gevonden.dhtml |title=Uniek Nederlands schip uit Gouden Eeuw gevonden |publisher=hln.be |date=14 March 2016 |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iain Borb MacLeod''' ([[Scottish Gaelic]]: '''Iain Borb MacLe√≤id'''; Anglicised as: '''John "the Turbulent" MacLeod''') (1392&amp;ndash;1442) is considered to be the sixth [[Scottish clan chief|chief]] of [[Clan MacLeod]]. He is the first MacLeod chief to which [[heraldry]] can be assigned. Clan tradition states that he was a minor at the time of his father's death and for six years an incompetent guardian led the clan to its lowest point in clan history. After reaching the age of maturity, Iain Borb managed to acquire some of the clan's lost lands and led his clan and his kinsmen (the [[Clan MacLeod of Lewis|MacLeods of Lewis]]) in the [[Battle of Harlaw]], in 1411. Iain Borb was wounded in the head during the conflict; the wound never completely healed and confined him to his home on [[Pabbay, Harris|Pabbay]] for much of his life. Tradition states that he died when this wound re-opened during a fencing/wrestling match. There is some disagreement as to which of his son's were the eldest; however, his son [[William Dubh MacLeod|William Dubh]] was the one who finally succeeded to the chiefship, following his death in 1442.

==Life==
Iain Borb was the son, and successor of [[William Cleireach MacLeod|William Cleireach]], fifth [[Scottish clan chief|chief]] of [[Clan MacLeod]]. According to the ''[[Bannatyne manuscript (Clan MacLeod)|Bannatyne manuscript]]'', he was only ten years old at the time of his father's death. The manuscript relates how during his [[Minor (law)|minority]] a [[Legal guardian|guardian]] was chosen to lead the [[Scottish clan|clan]]. This man's name was Iain Mishealbhach ('John the Unlucky') who was a cousin of the young Iain Borb. During Iain Mishealbhach's tenure as guardian, the MacLeods of [[Isle of Harris|Harris]] and [[Dunvegan]] were at their lowest point in their history. Many of the clan opposed the selection of Iain Mishealbhach, favouring instead Tormod Coil who slew Alastair Cannoch at the Battle of Sligachan. Tormod Coil defied the guardian and seized part of the lands of [[Glenelg, Highland|Glenelg]].&lt;ref name="MacLeodRC"/&gt;

The manuscript continues that the during this era, the [[Clan Donald|MacDonalds]] took full advantage of the disorderedness of the MacLeods. A force of MacDonalds landed at [[Sleat]] and took possession of the castles of [[Dunscaith Castle|Dunscaith]] and [[Castle Camus|Camus]] and in the process drove the MacLeods out of Sleat. They also invaded [[North Uist]] and fought the MacLeods at Cailus, where the MacLeods were completely defeated and further lands were gained by the invaders. Following these victories, the MacDonalds besieged [[Dunvegan Castle]], where the widow of William Cleireach was living at the time. The chief of the MacLeods of [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], however, came in force and relieved the castle, defeating the MacDonalds at Fiorlig. Torquil then took the family to Lewis where they remained until Iain Borb reached the age of maturity.&lt;ref name="MacLeodRC"/&gt;
[[File:Pabbay and boat.jpg|left|thumb|[[Pabbay, Harris]], where Iain Borb spent much of his life and where he died in 1442.]]
Iain Borb's first act as chief, according to the manuscript, was to [[hanging|hang]] Iain Mishealbhach, [[Confiscation|confiscate]] the dead man's lands, and [[banish]] his family. Later, Iain Borb made an agreement with [[Domhnall, Lord of the Isles]], in which the MacDonalds gave back the lands they won from the MacLeods&amp;mdash;except the lands on North Uist. Iain Borb swore his [[vassalage]] to the [[Lord of the Isles]] and in accordance to this agreement fought under the MacDonalds at the [[Battle of Harlaw]] in 1411. During the battle, Iain Borb commanded all the MacLeods (including the [[Clan MacLeod of Lewis|MacLeods of Lewis]]) and the manuscript states that the MacLeods had the honour of fighting on the right of Domhnall's forces.&lt;ref name="MacLeodRC"/&gt; Early 20th century [[Clan Donald]] historians A. and A. Macdonald, however, stated that both clans of MacLeods were in the main body of men commanded by Domhnall and that the right wing was made up of [[Clan MacLean|MacLeans]], commanded by [[Red Hector of the Battles Maclean|Hector MacLean of Duart]] (Red Hector of the Battles).&lt;ref name="Macdonald"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Angus|last1=Macdonald|first2=Archibald|last2=Macdonald|title=The Clan Donald|year=1900|publisher=The Northern Counties Publishing Company, Ltd|location=Inverness|volume=1|url=https://archive.org/details/clandonald01macd|pages=156, 160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript states how Iain Borb was wounded in the head during the conflict. The wound never entirely healed and for the rest of his life it would bleed whenever he became agitated. For the most part, Iain Borb lived at his castle on [[Pabbay, Harris|Pabbay]], where he renovated and enlarged the fortress there. The manuscript tells how during a fencing match with his [[Fosterage|foster-brother]], Somerled MacConn, Iain Borb's wound began to bleed so profusely that he [[bleed to death|bled to death]].&lt;ref name="MacLeodRC"/&gt;

[[File:Iona Abbey - altar.jpg|thumb|The [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] of [[Iona Abbey]]. The stone said to represent a [[MacLeod]] is visible on the floor in the middle. The [[effigy]] on the left (north) is of a [[Mackinnon]], the one on the right is a [[Clan Mackenzie|Mackenzie]].&lt;ref name="morrison"/&gt;]]

The ''Bannatyne manuscript'' states that the first seven chiefs of Clan MacLeod were buried at [[Iona]].&lt;ref name="MacLeodRC-30"/&gt; The [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] of [[Iona Abbey]], for the most part, dates from the early 16th century. Within the centre of the choir there is a large stone which once contained a [[monumental brass]], traditionally said to have been a MacLeod.&lt;ref name="morrison"&gt;{{cite book |last=Morrison |first=John |title=Behold Iona |url=https://archive.org/details/beholdionaguides00morruoft |year=1947 |publisher=[[Iona Community]] |location=[[Glasgow]] |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone formed a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]] which at one time contained the [[brass]] inlay (tradition states it was a [[silver]] inlay). It is the largest carved stone on the island, measuring {{convert|7|ft|9.25|in|m|2}} by {{convert|3|ft|10|in|m|2}}.&lt;ref name="MacMillan"&gt;{{cite book |last=MacMillan |first=Archibald |title=Iona: Its History and Antiquities |url=https://archive.org/details/ionaitshistoryan00macmuoft |year=1898 |publisher=Houlston &amp; Sons |location=[[London]] |pages=82&amp;ndash;83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; R.C. MacLeod speculated that perhaps the clan's founder, [[Leod]], and five of his successors were buried beneath&amp;mdash;however, in his opinion the fourth chief, [[Iain Ciar MacLeod|Iain Ciar]], was buried elsewhere.&lt;ref name="MacLeodRC-30"&gt;{{cite book |last=MacLeod |first=Roderick Charles |title=The MacLeods of Dunvegan |url=https://archive.org/details/macleodsofdunveg00macl |year=1927 |publisher=Privately printed for the Clan MacLeod Society |location=[[Edinburgh]] |page=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issue==
The ''Bannatyne manuscript'' records that Iain Borb married a granddaughter of the [[Earl of Douglas]].&lt;ref name="MacLeodRC"/&gt; Several 20th-century clan historians named her Margaret.&lt;ref name="I14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/ACMS/D0013/I14.html |title=John Iain Borb Macleod (VI Chief) |accessdate=10 January 2010 |work=www.macleodgenealogy.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924094447/http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/ACMS/D0013/I14.html |archivedate=24 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two sons, named ''William'' and ''Norman'' (''Tormod''), as well as two daughters. The manuscript maintains that Norman was the elder of the brothers, but that he died young and left a young son who was too young to succeed to the chiefship.&lt;ref name="MacLeodRC"/&gt; In fact, [[William Dubh MacLeod|William Dubh]] succeeded Iain Borb as chief of the clan.&lt;ref name="I14"/&gt; R.C. MacLeod considered the fact that the clan considered William chief and not guardian was evidence that William was in fact the elder brother.&lt;ref name="MacLeodRC"/&gt; A. Morrison stated that Norman was probably an [[illegitimate]] son of Iain Borb and that he was considerably older than William, since Norman led the clan in battle in 1428. According to Morrison, Norman was killed in 1429 and that his [[Posthumous birth|posthumous]] son was the progenitor of the MacLeods of Waternish. D. MacKinnon stated that he led the MacLeods and was slain at the battle in [[Lochaber]] in 1429, supporting [[Alexander, Lord of the Isles]] against [[James I of Scotland|James I]]. MacKinnon stated that he married a daughter of Chisholm of Strathglass, and by her had his son, John.&lt;ref name="I15"/&gt;

Morrison stated that Iain Borb's daughters were both born in [[Marriage|wedlock]].&lt;ref name="I15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/ACMS/D0014/I15.html |title=Norman Macleod (of Arnisdale) |accessdate=10 January 2010 |work=www.macleodgenealogy.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to MacKinnon, one of the daughters, Margaret, married Roderick MacLeod of Lewis (6th clan chief).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/ACMS/D0032/I231.html |title=Margaret Macleod |accessdate=10 January 2010 |work=www.macleodgenealogy.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; MacLeod stated that the other daughter married [[Lachlan Bronneach Maclean|Lachlan MacLean, of Duart]] (7th chief of [[Clan MacLean]]).&lt;ref name="MacLeodRC"&gt;{{cite book |last=MacLeod |first=Roderick Charles |title=The MacLeods of Dunvegan |url=https://archive.org/details/macleodsofdunveg00macl |year=1927 |publisher=Privately printed for the Clan MacLeod Society |location=[[Edinburgh]] |pages=60&amp;ndash;67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The late 19th-century clan historian A.M. Sinclair stated that her name was ''Finvola'' and noted that the couple had two sons, Neil and [[John Garbh Maclean, 1st Laird of Coll|John Garbh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinclair |first=Alexander Maclean |title=The Clan Gillean |url=https://archive.org/details/clangillean00sincuoft |year=1899 |publisher=Haszard and Moore |location=[[Charlottetown]] |page=248 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several years earlier another late 19th century Clan MacLean historian, [[John Patterson MacLean|J.P. MacLean]] named Lachlan's wife as "Fionnaghal, daughter of William MacLeod of Harris".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacLean |first=John Patterson |authorlink=John Patterson MacLean |title=A history of the Clan MacLean from its first settlement at Duard Castle, in the Isle of Mull, to the present period; including a genealogical account of some of the principal families together with their heraldry, legends, superstitions, etc |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofclanmac00macl |year=1889 |publisher=R.

Her maternal uncle Count [[Amadeus VI of Savoy]] arranged her marriage with [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]]. As her dowry, Isabella received the county of [[Sommi√®res]], exchanged later for the county of [[Vertus]]. On 8 October 1360, Isabella and Gian Galeazzo were married in Milan, and six months later, in April 1361, she was declared sovereign Countess of Vertus. The couple had four children:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storiadimilano.it/Personaggi/Visconti/visconti.htm#Gian Galeazzo ''Gian Galeazzo'' in: Storiadimilano.it] [retrieved 12 September 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4075">'''Jean H√©l√®ne''' (8 August 1953 in [[Mulhouse]] ‚Äì 21 October 2003) was a French journalist specializing in Africa.  He was working for [[Radio France Internationale]] in [[Ivory Coast]] when he was killed in [[Abidjan]] by police Sergeant Th√©odore S√©ry Dago. Jean H√©l√®ne was his press name, Christian Baldensberger being his real name.

== Controversial Journalism==
Earlier, Jean H√©l√®ne had served as the [[Le Monde]] correspondent in Rwanda.  His coverage of the [[Rwandan genocide]] during this period was biased in favour of the [[Hutu]]s.  In particular, during the early months when thousands of civilians were butchered, he characterized the killings as those of enemy combatants.  
A French court ruling in May 1999 says:
:Considering that an examination of the press cuttings entered into evidence shows that during the first two months of the conflict Le Monde, through its correspondent, Jean Helene, highlighted the "civil war" aspect of the conflict...&lt;ref&gt;

==Murder and Trial==

On 21 October 2003, in a prevailing atmosphere of rabid anti-French sentiment during the [[Civil war in C√¥te d'Ivoire]], H√©l√®ne had gone to the Abidjan police headquarters to interview some government opponents who had just been released from detention. Apparently he had an altercation with Sergeant Dago over parking, following which Dago went inside, grabbed an [[AK-47]] and shot him dead 
as he was walking from his car, talking on his mobile phone.

Sergeant Dago was immediately arrested and apparently confessed to the crime.  Subsequently however, he changed his position claiming that he had come inside the building after talking to Helene when he heard the shots that killed him.

There was wide international condemnation of the event. 
Amnesty international said: 
:The fact that a sergeant can kill a journalist who posed no threat to him in cold blood shows the atmosphere of [[impunity]] in which C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire security forces have been operating.&lt;ref&gt;

After the event, Th√©odore S√©ry Dago became a hero and a Dago 
support committee was formed.

&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2004, a military court under judge 
Ahmed Lanz√©ni Coulibaly considered ballistic evidence which indicated
that the bullet had been shot from Dago's service weapon, and 
found him guilty of having
"deliberately killed" Helene. Dago was sentenced to 17 years in prison.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"John Clements (Deceased), Teacher, Sherrardswood School, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. Mr. Clements was one of a party of six adults and thirty-seven children who were staying at a ski-resort in Northern Italy on an eight-day visit. At about 4 a.m. on 12th April 1976, smoke was noticed and Mr. Clements was one of those who quickly raised the alarm and ordered the children to go down-stairs. A number of children were led to safety through dense smoke by other members of the staff who, having got out of the hotel, then helped further children to escape from a first floor balcony to the ground. Meanwhile, Mr. Clements had climbed down from a third floor balcony on the West side of the building to a second floor balcony; he then reached the first floor where he organised a number of children into small groups and assisted them to escape by means of a rope he had improvised from knotted sheets. When the room was evacuated Mr. Clements refused to leave the hotel and went back into the building which in a matter of minutes was burning fiercely. He was seen on at least two occasions to go back into the hotel after carrying or dragging people out, and he ignored repeated attempts to restrain him. Mr. Clement was finally overcome by fumes and he died in the fire. Mr. Clements displayed outstanding gallantry and devotion to duty in circumstances of extreme danger. He showed no regard for his personal safety when he remained in the fiercely burning hotel in his endeavours to save those still trapped by the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=47085 |date=6 December 1976 |page=16447 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1869">'''Kamal Bamadhaj''' was a [[political science]] student and [[human rights]] activist, who was killed in the [[Dili Massacre]] in [[East Timor]] on November 12, 1991.

Of [[Malaysia]]n and [[New Zealand]] parentage, he was the only foreign national to be killed when [[Indonesia]]n troops opened fire on a funeral procession at the Santa Cruz cemetery in [[Dili]]. He attended the [[University of New South Wales]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], and worked as an interpreter for Australian [[aid agency|aid agencies]] working in East Timor.

The Indonesian military commander in East Timor, Sintong Panjaitan, who was removed from the post, later went to study in the [[United States]]. In 1994, Bamadhaj's mother, Helen Todd, sued Panjaitan for punitive damages in a US court, but he dismissed the court's decision as 'a joke' &lt;ref&gt;[http://etan.org/et/1998/june/june16/massacre.htm etan.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to Indonesia. 

A 1999 film, called ''Punitive Damage'', tells the story of Todd's legal battle.

'''Kleptothermy''' is any form of [[thermoregulation]] by which an animal shares in the metabolic [[thermogenesis]] of another animal. It may or may not be reciprocal, and occurs in both [[endotherm]]s and [[ectotherm]]s. Its most common form is '''huddling'''.

==Huddling==
[[File:Snuggling garder snakes 001.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Male Canadian [[garter snakes]] huddle around a female after [[hibernation]] when mating.]]
Some species of ectotherms including [[lizard]]s&lt;ref&gt;Shah B, Shine R, Hudson S, Kearney M. (2003). Sociality in lizards: why do thick-tailed geckos (Nephrurus milii) aggregate? Behaviour 140, 1039‚Äì1052. {{doi|10.1163/156853903322589632}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[snake]]s, such as [[boa constrictor]]s&lt;ref&gt;Myres BC, Eells MM. (1968). Thermal aggregation in Boa constrictor. Herpetologica 24, 61‚Äì66. {{jstor|3891156}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[tiger snake]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Aubret F, Shine R. (2009). Causes and consequences of
aggregation by neonatal tiger snakes (Notechis scutatus, Elapidae). Aust. Ecol. 34, 210‚Äì217. {{doi|10.1111/j.1442-9993.2008.01923.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  increase their effective mass by clustering tightly together. It is also widespread amongst gregarious endotherms such as [[bat]]s&lt;ref&gt;Arends A, Bonaccorso FJ, Genoud M. (1995). Basal rates of metabolism of nectarivorous bats (Phyllostomidae) from a semiarid thorn forest in Venezuela. J. Mammal. 76, 947‚Äì956. {{doi|10.2307/1382765}}&lt;/ref&gt; and birds (such as the [[mousebird]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = C. R. | last2 = Foster | first2 = G. G. | doi = 10.1007/BF00296648 | title = The thermal and energetic significance of clustering in the speckled mousebird, ''Colius striatus''| journal = [[Journal of Comparative Physiology B]] | volume = 162 | issue = 7 | pages = 658‚Äì664| year = 1992 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[emperor penguin]]&lt;ref&gt;Ancel A, Visser H, Handrich Y, Masman D. Le Maho Y. (1997). Energy saving in huddling penguins. Nature 385, 304‚Äì305. {{doi|10.1038/385304a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) where  it allows the sharing of body heat (particularly among juveniles).

In at least one case this is not reciprocal, and might be accurately described as ''heat-stealing''. Some male Canadian red sided [[garter snake]]s engage in female [[mimicry]] by producing fake [[pheromone]]s after emerging from [[hibernation]]. This causes rival males to cover them in a mistaken attempt to mate, and so transfer heat to them. This allows those males that mimic females to become more quickly revitalized after hibernation (which depends upon raising their body temperature), giving them an advantage in their own attempts to mate.&lt;ref&gt;Shine R, Phillips B, Waye H, LeMaster M, Mason RT. (2001). Benefits of female mimicry to snakes. Nature, 414, 267. {{doi|10.1038/35104687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat sharing==
Many ectotherms exploit the heat produced by endotherms by sharing their [[nest]]s and [[burrow]]s. For example, mammal burrows are used by [[gecko]]s and seabird burrows by Australian [[tiger snake]]s  and New Zealand [[tuatara]]&lt;ref&gt;Newman DG. (1987). Burrow use and population densities of Tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) and how they are influenced by fairy prions (Pachyptila turtur) on Stephens Island, New Zealand. Herpetologica 43, 336‚Äì344. {{jstor|3892500}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Termite]]s create high and regulated temperatures in their mounds, and this is exploited by some species of lizards, snakes and crocodiles.&lt;ref&gt;Ehmann H, Swan G, Swan G, Smith B. (1991) Nesting, egg incubation and hatching by the heath monitor Varanus rosenbergi in a termite mound. Herpetofauna 21, 17‚Äì24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knapp CR, Owens AK. (2008).

Research has shown such kleptothermy can be advantageous: the [[blue-lipped sea krait]], when it occupies a burrow of a pair of [[wedge-tailed shearwater]] incubating their chick, raises its body temperature to {{convert|37.5|C|F}} compared to {{convert|31.7|C|F}}  when in other habitats. Its body temperature is also more stable. Burrows without birds did not provide this heat being only {{convert|28|C|F}} .&lt;ref&gt;Brischoux F, Bonnet X, Shine R. (2009).  Kleptothermy: an additional category of thermoregulation, and a possible example in sea kraits (Laticauda laticaudata, Serpentes).

Opponents of him in those elections were the Bishop of [[Larnaca|Kition]] Meletios, the Bishop of Kykkos Kleopas and archimandrite Makarios Myriantheas, later known as [[Makarios II]] who became Archbishop of Cyprus years later.

He was more moderate than his predecessor [[Kyrillos II]] and was accused of being too sympathetic to the British colonial rulers of [[Cyprus]]. He was also elected as one of the 6 Christian Legislators in the Cypriot Parliament.

'''Leslie Ruthven Pym''' (24 May 1884 &amp;ndash; 17 July 1945) was a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician in the [[United Kingdom]].

The son of the [[Walter Pym|Right Reverend Walter Ruthven Pym]], [[Diocese of Bombay of the Church of North India|Bishop of Bombay]], Pym was educated at [[Bedford School]] and [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p14057.htm The Peerage]&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Monmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouth]] in [[Wales]] at a [[Monmouth by-election, 1939|by-election in 1939]].  He represented the constituency in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] until his death during the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]]. Polling took place on 5 July 1945. Pym died 12 days later, but nine days before the declaration of the result. He was declared posthumously elected on 26 July 1945, provoking a by-election in his Monmouth constituency. That contest was won by [[Peter Thorneycroft]].

Leslie Pym died on 17 July 1945, three days before his brother, [[Thomas Wentworth Pym|Revd Canon Thomas Wentworth Pym]], and, coincidentally, on the same day as [[Sir Edward Campbell, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Campbell]], the member for [[Bromley (UK Parliament constituency)|Bromley]], who was also posthumously elected.

In the [[Coalition Government 1940‚Äì1945|war-time coalition government]], he was a [[whip (politics)|government whip]].

Pym was a descendant of the 17th century [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarian]] [[John Pym]]. His son [[Francis Pym|Francis]] (1922‚Äì2008) was later a Conservative MP and [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet minister]].

'''Luis Abadiano y Vald√©s''' (born '''Jos√© Mar√≠a Ygnacio Luis Obispo Sotero Gonzaga Abadiano y Vald√©s'''; baptised 22 April 1789&lt;ref&gt;''Mexico, Select Church Records, 1537-1966''&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äì ) was a 19th-century printer and publisher in [[Mexico City]], one in a long line of printers, publishers, booksellers and book collectors traceable back to the famous Humanist and bibliographer [[Juan Jos√© de Eguiara y Eguren]], founder of the printing house Biblioteca Mexicana (Mexican Library) in 1753.

==Antecedents==
Father Juan Jos√© de Eguiara y Eguren founded the publishing house Biblioteca Mexicana in 1753. He also published the work ''Biblioteca Mexicana''. This was a compilation, a work of literary history, a dictionary of literary biography, and a bibliography, but Eguiara y Egure got only as far as the letter "J".

Eguiara's printing shop was acquired by Licenciado Jos√© de J√°uregui in 1767. The following year J√°uregui's establishment merged with that of heirs of Mar√≠a de Ribera. J√°uregui died in 1778, and the business passed to his heirs. In 1791 his nephew Jos√© Fern√°ndez J√°uregui took over the business and directed it until his death in 1800. His heir was Mar√≠a Fern√°ndez de J√°uregui. She died in 1815, and in 1817 the business was sold to Alejandro Vald√©s.

Vald√©s was already an established printer, having maintained his own print shop from 1808 to 1814. In 1815 he acquired the business of his famed father, [[Manuel Antonio Vald√©s y Mungu√≠a]]. The elder Vald√©s had been the printer for the Jesuit College of San Ildefonso until 1767. In that year he joined [[Felipe de Z√∫√±iga y Ontiveros]], at that time the largest printer in the Americas. While he was associated with Z√∫√±iga y Ontiveros, Vald√©s y Mungu√≠a was the editor of the ''[[Gaceta de M√©xico]]'', after its reestablishment in 1784.

The Spanish [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Constitution of C√°diz]] of 1812 included a guarantee of freedom of the press. Many more political books and tracts appeared then in the preceding years. Alejandro Vald√©s continued publishing in this more liberal atmosphere. In 1816 he published the classic bibliography, [[Jos√© Mariano Berist√°in y Sousa]]'s ''Biblioteca Americana Septentrional''. This was based on Eguiara's ''Biblioteca Mexicana'', but much updated and expanded.

==Biography==
Following Mexican independence in 1821, Vald√©s became imperial printer for the government of [[Agust√≠n de Iturbide]], for the printing of official documents. About this time, Vald√©s took Luis Abadiano as partner, an association that lasted until Vald√©s's death in 1831. At this date, the firm was the oldest publisher and bookseller in the country.

In 1836 Luis Abadiano published the following invitation (given in part):

&lt;center&gt;Translation of the Marvelous Image of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]]&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In December 1836 will be presented with new brilliance the glory that was given to our America in 1531. At 9 in the morning of December 10, the celestial image of St. Mary of Guadalupe will be transferred from the Church of the Carmelites to the renowned Collegiate Church, so that the image will be placed in a new altar, a worthy work of the magnificent piety of the Mexicans. Perhaps there will never be seen a procession so solemn and edifying as that which is being prepared for this event, which will be proceeded  and accompanied by the most affectionate and fervent orations in all of the Republic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the death of Luis Abadiano, the business passed to his sons Francisco and Dionisio.

==Afterwards==
Between 1825 and 1884, the Abadiano family ran both the printing and the bookselling enterprises descended from Eguiara's original shop. They published several thousand titles, of high quality, and were extremely active as booksellers. The sons were students of Mexican antiquities, and also collectors.

The highly religious and conservative Abadiano family also dealt extensively in books and pamphlets related to the Church in Mexico. During the secular reforms of 1857 through 1861, many of the books and manuscripts of the libraries of Mexico City convents were transferred to the Abadianos or purchased by them and held in trust with the intent of restoring them at a future date. The fear was that they would be appropriated or destroyed by the government.

In 1883 the book business, located at Calle de las Escalerillas (today, ''calle de Guatemala''), was inherited by Eufemio Abadiano, son of Francisco, but Eufemio lacked the inclination or the ability to continue the family tradition. In 1885 he founded a magazine devoted to Mexican literature and history, and also began making reproductions of famous Mexican archaeological objects. However, this enterprise was unsuccessful. In 1887 he announced his intention of auctioning the library and art collection of his father and the stock on hand in the bookstore. In 1889, most of the remaining books were sold to [[Adolph Sutro]] of San Francisco.

Sutro (or his agents) acquired everything that remained of the firm &amp;mdash; individual titles published from the sixteenth to the mid-19th centuries, the largest collection of 19th-century Mexican pamphlets and ephemera in the world, an extraordinary collection of imprints and manuscripts relating to the Church in Mexico, and publisher's remainders dating from as far back as the mid-18th century. Sutro also bought the Abadiano ledgers, receipt books and galley proofs dating from the late 18th century. He thus obtained an important collection of documents related to the history of printing and bookselling in Mexico.

Much of Sutro's collection (of which his Mexican purchases were only a part), was destroyed in the earthquake and fire of 1906. However the Mexican collection survived intact. It consisted of forty to fifty thousand books, pamphlets, broadsides and manuscripts. In 1913 Sutro's heirs donated his surviving library, including the Mexican collection, to the California State Library under the condition that it remain in San Francisco.

'''Mary Elisabeth Hansen Mead''' (June 21, 1935 ‚Äì June 21, 1996) was an American rancher, businesswoman, and a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wyoming]]. She was the daughter of [[governor of Wyoming|Governor]] and [[U.S. Senator]] [[Clifford Hansen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wyomingnews.com/articles/2009/10/24/obituaries/01obit_10-24-09.txt|title=Obituary of Clifford P. Hansen|publisher=''[[Wyoming Tribune-Eagle]]'', October 24, 2009|accessdate=October 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mother of current Governor [[Matt Mead]].

In 1990, Mead was the unsuccessful [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] nominee for governor, having been defeated by the incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Mike Sullivan (governor)|Mike Sullivan]] of [[Douglas, Wyoming|Douglas]] in [[Converse County, Wyoming|Converse County]] in southeastern Wyoming. In the general election, Sullivan prevailed with 104,638 votes (65.4 percent) to Mead's 55,471 ballots (34.6 percent). Mead polled only 4,311 more votes against Sullivan than she had received in her [[closed primary]] in August and was hence unable to procure support beyond her party base.&lt;ref&gt;Wyoming Secretary of State, Gubernatorial election returns, November 6, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Mead was born in [[Jackson, Wyoming]] to Clifford Peter Hansen (1912‚Äì2009), a native of [[Lincoln County, Wyoming|Lincoln County]], and the former Martha Close (1914‚Äì2011), who was reared in [[Sheridan, Wyoming|Sheridan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/article_e44914e2-eabd-11e0-a75e-001cc4c03286.html|title=Martha Hansen, Gov. Mead's grandmother, dies|publisher=''Wyoming Tribune Eagle'', September 29, 2011|accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother, Peter Arthur Hansen (born 1936), resides in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]], Wyoming.

In 1957, she received her [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in history from the [[University of Wyoming]] in [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]]. She married Peter Bradford Mead (born 1933), who coincidentally partly bears the same name as her father, brother, and grandfather. For more than twenty years, she and Peter managed the family cattle ranch, originally homesteaded by her grandparents, Peter Christofferson Hansen and the former Sylvia Irene Wood. The Meads reared three children. After their divorce, she ran the ranch with her parents and then with her older son, Bradford Scott Mead, and his wife, Katherine L. "Kate" Mead&lt;ref name=mead&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbcranch.com/Portals/0/mary_mead.pdf|title=Mary Mead|publisher=barbcranch.com|accessdate=October 31, 2012}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (both born 1957), a native of [[Vermont]], who came to Wyoming on a [[skiing]] scholarship and in 2006 was the Republican nominee for the District 16 seat in the [[Wyoming House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="soswy.state.wy.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soswy.state.wy.us/Elections/06Results/06General/TE_PbP_Candidate_Summary.pdf |title=Wyoming general election returns, November 7, 2006 |publisher=soswy.state.wy.us |accessdate=October 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927124603/http://soswy.state.wy.us/Elections/06Results/06General/TE_PbP_Candidate_Summary.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, she married Dick Steinhour.&lt;ref name=mead/&gt; 

Mead was a president of the Wyoming Business Alliance and a member of the University of Wyoming Alumni Board, the Wyoming Centennial Commission, and the National Public Lands Advisory Council. She was active in both the [[Wyoming Stock Growers Association]], of which her father was the president from 1953 to 1955, and the Wyoming Tax Payers Association. In Jackson, she sat on the boards of St. John's Hospital and the Jackson State Bank.&lt;ref name=mead/&gt;

She lived on the Mead Ranch, officially the "Lower Bar BC", which prior to its sale{{spaced ndash}}for more than $100 million{{spaced ndash}}was one of the largest pastoral private holdings in Teton County. The Hansens and Meads were particularly known for [[Habitat conservation|conservation]] and stewardship activities on their properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacksonholenews.com/Archives/NewsArchive/2003/030625-News.html |title=Mead Ranch on the Block |publisher=''Jackson Hole News'', [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming|Jackson Hole]], [[Wyoming]] |accessdate=October 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928135947/http://www.jacksonholenews.com/Archives/NewsArchive/2003/030625-News.html |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 2001, the Lower Bar BC had become no longer economically productive and surrendered its {{convert|2000|acre|km2|adj=on}} lease in Grand Teton Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcn.org/issues/211/10745|title=Jack Clinton, "Grand Teton rancher gives up grazing lease"|publisher=''High Country News'', September 24, 2001|accessdate=October 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==

Though considered an expert [[Equestrianism|horsewoman]], Mead was killed on her 61st birthday in an accident while working cattle on leased land in [[Grand Teton National Park]] near the Mead Ranch in Spring Gulch. She was thrown by her horse, which then collapsed upon her. She was born and died on a Friday.&lt;ref name=mead/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetjh.com/news/A_105566.aspx|title=Ben Cannon, "Mead launches campaign for Gov.", November 18, 2009|publisher=planetjh.com|accessdate=October 31, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225094443/http://planetjh.com/news/A_105566.aspx|archivedate=February 25, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Governor Matt Mead, who is also a former [[U.S. attorney]] in Cheyenne, Mead's other children are Bradford Scott "Brad" Mead (born July 24, 1957) and Muffy Mead-Ferro, an author in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. Brad Mead and his wife, Katherine L. "Kate" Mead (also born 1957), are attorneys in Jackson. Kate Mead, a [[Vermont]] native who came to Wyoming on a [[skiing]] scholarship, was the Republican nominee in 2006 for the District 16 seat in the [[Wyoming House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="soswy.state.wy.us"/&gt; Both Bradford Mead and Clifford Hansen recorded interviews to be used as a part of the new [http://www.jacksonholehistory.org/ Jackson Hole Historical Society Museum], to be unveiled in downtown Jackson. Mead's cremated remains lie, along with those of her parents, in a crypt in the St. John's [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] Church Mausoleum in Jackson.

Her children established the dual Mary Mead Memorial Scholarship and Graduate Fellowship for Women in Agriculture at the University of Wyoming. These awards honor her lifetime commitment to the Wyoming livestock industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwyo.edu/agprograms/scholarships/|title=Scholarships at the University of Wyoming|publisher=uwyo.edu|accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mead children also released this eulogy to their mother:&lt;blockquote&gt;One of Jackson's pre-eminent ranchers was "a woman born to the land that she knew every inch of -- every ditch, every bog, every dry patch, every likely place to look for an errant bunch of cows during spring gathering.&lt;br&gt;
 
She was a diligent midwife to nearly one thousand mother cows every spring, she kept many an all-night vigil with a cow in difficulty or bottle-feeding a shivering newborn as she talked to it and rubbed it with a blanket on her kitchen floor.&lt;ref name=mead/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[machine learning]], the '''perceptron''' is an algorithm for [[supervised classification|supervised learning]] of [[binary classification|binary classifiers]].  A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class.{{r|largemargin}}  It is a type of [[linear classifier]], i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a [[linear predictor function]] combining a set of weights with the [[feature vector]].

==History==
[[File:Mark I perceptron.jpeg|thumb|left|The Mark I Perceptron machine was the first implementation of the perceptron algorithm. The machine was connected to a camera that used 20√ó20 [[cadmium sulfide]] [[photocell]]s to produce a 400-pixel image. The main visible feature is a patchboard that allowed experimentation with different combinations of input features. To the right of that are arrays of [[potentiometer]]s that implemented the adaptive weights.{{r|bishop}}{{rp|213}}]]
{{see also|History of artificial intelligence#Perceptrons and the dark age of connectionism|AI winter#The abandonment of connectionism in 1969}}
The perceptron algorithm was invented in 1957 at the [[Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory]] by [[Frank Rosenblatt]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblatt, Frank (1957), The Perceptron--a perceiving and recognizing automaton. Report 85-460-1, Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the United States [[Office of Naval Research]].&lt;ref name="Olazaran"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mikel Olazaran |title=A Sociological Study of the Official History of the Perceptrons Controversy |journal=Social Studies of Science |volume=26 |issue=3 |year=1996 |jstor=285702|doi=10.1177/030631296026003005 |pages=611‚Äì659}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The perceptron was intended to be a machine, rather than a program, and while its first implementation was in software for the [[IBM 704]], it was subsequently implemented in custom-built hardware as the "Mark 1 perceptron". This machine was designed for image recognition: it had an array of 400 [[photocell]]s, randomly connected to the "neurons". Weights were encoded in [[potentiometer]]s, and weight updates during learning were performed by electric motors.&lt;ref name="bishop"&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher M. |last=Bishop |year=2006 |title=Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|193}}

In a 1958 press conference organized by the US Navy, Rosenblatt made statements about the perceptron that caused a heated controversy among the fledgling [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] community; based on Rosenblatt's statements, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported the perceptron to be "the embryo of an electronic computer that [the Navy] expects will be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence."&lt;ref name="Olazaran"/&gt;

Although the perceptron initially seemed promising, it was quickly proved that perceptrons could not be trained to recognise many classes of patterns. This caused the field of neural network research to stagnate for many years, before it was recognised that a [[feedforward neural network]] with two or more layers (also called a [[multilayer perceptron]]) had far greater processing power than perceptrons with one layer (also called a [[Feedforward neural network#Single-layer perceptron|single layer perceptron]]).{{dubious|date=June 2014}}
Single layer perceptrons are only capable of learning [[linearly separable]] patterns; in 1969 a famous book entitled ''[[Perceptrons (book)|Perceptrons]]'' by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]] showed that it was impossible for these classes of network to learn an [[XOR]] function. However, this doesn't hold for non-linear classification functions that can be used in a single layer perceptron. Applying such functions extend the perceptron abilities including implementation of XOR function.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8336337/ {{lang|en|Melnychuk S., Yakovyn S., Kuz M. Emulation of logical functions NOT, AND, OR, and XOR with a perceptron implemented using an information entropy function // 2018 14th International Conference on Advanced Trends in Radioelecrtronics, Telecommunications and Computer Engineering (TCSET). - 2018. - P.878-882}}] {{ref-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often believed (incorrectly) that they also conjectured that a similar result would hold for a multi-layer perceptron network. However, this is not true, as both Minsky and Papert already knew that multi-layer perceptrons were capable of producing an XOR function. (See the page on ''[[Perceptrons (book)]]'' for more information.)  Three years later [[Stephen Grossberg]] published a series of papers introducing networks capable of modelling differential, contrast-enhancing and XOR functions. (The papers were published in 1972 and 1973, see e.g.:{{cite journal |last1=Grossberg |first1= |year=1973 |title=Contour enhancement, short-term memory, and constancies in reverberating neural networks |url=http://cns.bu.edu/Profiles/Grossberg/Gro1973StudiesAppliedMath.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Studies in Applied Mathematics |volume=52 |issue=|pages=213‚Äì257 }}). Nevertheless, the often-miscited Minsky/Papert text caused a significant decline in interest and funding of neural network research. It took ten more years until [[neural network]] research experienced a resurgence in the 1980s.  This text was reprinted in 1987 as "Perceptrons - Expanded Edition" where some errors in the original text are shown and corrected.

The [[kernel perceptron]] algorithm was already introduced in 1964 by Aizerman et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aizerman |first1=M. A. |last2=Braverman |first2=E. M. |last3=Rozonoer |first3=L.

The perceptron is a simplified model of a biological [[neuron]]. While the complexity of [[Biological neuron model|biological neuron models]] is often required to fully understand neural behavior, research suggests a perceptron-like linear model can produce some behavior seen in real neurons &lt;ref&gt;Morel, D., Singh, C. &amp; Levy, W.B. J Comput Neurosci (2018). http://rdcu.be/FDUo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cash, Sydney, and Rafael Yuste. "Linear summation of excitatory inputs by CA1 pyramidal neurons." Neuron 22.2 (1999): 383-394. APA&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Definition ==
In the modern sense, the perceptron is an algorithm for learning a binary classifier: a function that maps its input &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; (a real-valued [[Vector space|vector]]) to an output value &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; (a single [[Binary function|binary]] value):

f(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{cases}1 &amp; \text{if }\ \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} + b &gt; 0\\0 &amp; \text{otherwise}\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of real-valued weights, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dot product]] &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^m w_i x_i&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|m}} is the number of inputs to the perceptron, and {{mvar|b}} is the ''bias''. The bias shifts the decision boundary away from the origin and does not depend on any input value.

The value of &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; (0 or 1) is used to classify &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; as either a positive or a negative instance, in the case of a binary classification problem. If {{mvar|b}} is negative, then the weighted combination of inputs must produce a positive value greater than &lt;math&gt;|b|&lt;/math&gt; in order to push the classifier neuron over the 0 threshold. Spatially, the bias alters the position (though not the orientation) of the [[decision boundary]]. The perceptron learning algorithm does not terminate if the learning set is not [[linearly separable]]. If the vectors are not linearly separable learning will never reach a point where all vectors are classified properly. The most famous example of the perceptron's inability to solve problems with linearly nonseparable vectors is the Boolean [[exclusive-or]] problem. The solution spaces of decision boundaries for all binary functions and learning behaviors are studied in the reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liou |first=D.-R. |last2=Liou |first2=J.-W. |last3=Liou |first3=C.-Y. |title=Learning Behaviors of Perceptron |isbn=978-1-477554-73-9 |publisher=iConcept Press |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of neural networks, a perceptron is an [[artificial neuron]] using the [[Heaviside step function]] as the activation function. The perceptron algorithm is also termed the '''single-layer perceptron''', to distinguish it from a [[multilayer perceptron]], which is a misnomer for a more complicated neural network.  As a linear classifier, the single-layer perceptron is the simplest [[feedforward neural network]].

==Learning algorithm==
Below is an example of a learning algorithm for a (single-layer) perceptron. For [[multilayer perceptron]]s, where a hidden layer exists, more sophisticated algorithms such as [[backpropagation]] must be used. Alternatively, methods such as the [[delta rule]] can be used if the function is non-linear and differentiable, although the one below will work as well.

When multiple perceptrons are combined in an artificial neural network, each output neuron operates independently of all the others; thus, learning each output can be considered in isolation.
[[File:Perceptron example.svg|500px|thumb |Right |A diagram showing a perceptron updating its linear boundary as more training examples are added.]]

=== Definitions ===

We first define some variables:
*&lt;math&gt;y = f(\mathbf{z}) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''output'' from the perceptron for an input vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;D = \{(\mathbf{x}_1,d_1),\dots,(\mathbf{x}_s,d_s)\} &lt;/math&gt; is the ''training set'' of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; samples, where:
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_j&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional input vector.
** &lt;math&gt;d_j &lt;/math&gt; is the desired output value of the perceptron for that input.
We show the values of the features as follows:
*&lt;math&gt;x_{j,i} &lt;/math&gt; is the value of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th feature of the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th training ''input vector''.
*&lt;math&gt;x_{j,0} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;.
To represent the weights: 
*&lt;math&gt;w_i &lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th value in the ''weight vector'', to be multiplied by the value of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th input feature.
*Because &lt;math&gt;x_{j,0} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;w_0 &lt;/math&gt; is effectively a bias that we use instead of the bias constant &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.
To show the time-dependence of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt;, we use:
*&lt;math&gt;w_i(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the weight &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
Unlike other linear classification algorithms such as [[logistic regression]], there is no need for a ''learning rate'' in the perceptron algorithm. This is because multiplying the update by any constant simply rescales the weights but never changes the sign of the prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Genevieve B. Orr|title=The Perceptron|url=https://www.willamette.edu/~gorr/classes/cs449/Classification/perceptron.html|publisher=Willamette University|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Perceptron.svg|right|thumb|500px|The appropriate weights are applied to the inputs, and the resulting weighted sum passed to a function that produces the output o.]]

=== Steps===
{{Ordered list 
| Initialize the weights and the threshold. Weights may be initialized to 0 or to a small random value. In the example below, we use 0.
| For each example {{mvar|j}} in our training set {{mvar|D}}, perform the following steps over the input &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_j &lt;/math&gt; and desired output &lt;math&gt;d_j &lt;/math&gt;:
{{Ordered list |list_style_type=lower-alpha
|Calculate the actual output:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
y_j(t) &amp;= f[\mathbf{w}(t)\cdot\mathbf{x}_j] \\
&amp;= f[w_0(t)x_{j,0} + w_1(t)x_{j,1} + w_2(t)x_{j,2} + \dotsb + w_n(t)x_{j,n}]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|Update the weights:
:&lt;math&gt;w_i(t+1) = w_i(t) + r\cdot(d_j - y_j(t)) x_{j,i} &lt;/math&gt;, for all features &lt;math&gt;0 \leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the learning rate.
}}
| For [[offline learning]], the second step may be repeated until the iteration error &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{s} \sum_{j=1}^s |d_j - y_j(t)| &lt;/math&gt; is less than a user-specified error threshold &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt;/math&gt;, or a predetermined number of iterations have been completed, where ''s'' is again the size of the sample set. 
}}
The algorithm updates the weights after steps 2a and 2b. These weights are immediately applied to a pair in the training set, and subsequently updated, rather than waiting until all pairs in the training set have undergone these steps.

===Convergence===
The perceptron is a [[linear classifier]], therefore it will never get to the state with all the input vectors classified correctly if the training set {{mvar|D}} is not [[linearly separable]], i.e. if the positive examples cannot be separated from the negative examples by a hyperplane. In this case, no "approximate" solution will be gradually approached under the standard learning algorithm, but instead learning will fail completely. Hence, if linear separability of the training set is not known a priori, one of the training variants below should be used.

If the training set ''is'' linearly separable, then the perceptron is guaranteed to converge. Furthermore, there is an upper bound on the number of times the perceptron will adjust its weights during the training.

Suppose that the input vectors from the two classes can be separated by a hyperplane with a margin &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt;/math&gt;, i.e. there exists a weight vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}, ||\mathbf{w}||=1&lt;/math&gt;, and a bias term {{mvar|b}} such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}_j &gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j: d_j=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}_j &lt; -\gamma &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j: d_j=0&lt;/math&gt;{{Specify|reason=Symbol d is not defined and the meaning of j:d_j is not described|date=May 2018}}. Also, let {{mvar|R}} denote the maximum norm of an input vector. Novikoff (1962) proved that in this case the perceptron algorithm converges after making &lt;math&gt;O(R^2/\gamma^2)&lt;/math&gt; updates. The idea of the proof is that the weight vector is always adjusted by a bounded amount in a direction with which it has a negative [[dot product]], and thus can be bounded above by {{math|''O''({{sqrt|''t''}})}}, where {{mvar|t}} is the number of changes to the weight vector. However, it can also be bounded below by {{math|''O''(''t'')}} because if there exists an (unknown) satisfactory weight vector, then every change makes progress in this (unknown) direction by a positive 
amount that depends only on the input vector.

[[File:Perceptron cant choose.svg|thumb|300px|Two classes of points, and two of the infinitely many linear boundaries that separate them. Even though the boundaries are at nearly right angles to one another, the perceptron algorithm has no way of choosing between them.]]
While the perceptron algorithm is guaranteed to converge on ''some'' solution in the case of a linearly separable training set, it may still pick ''any'' solution and problems may admit many solutions of varying quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bishop |first=Christopher M |title=Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media, LLC |isbn=978-0387-31073-2 |chapter=Chapter 4. Linear Models for Classification |pages=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''perceptron of optimal stability'', nowadays better known as the linear [[support vector machine]], was designed to solve this problem (Krauth and Mezard, 1987)&lt;ref name="KrauthMezard87"&gt;W. Krauth and M. Mezard. Learning algorithms with optimal stability in neural networks. J. of Physics A: Math. Gen. 20: L745-L752 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Variants ==
The pocket algorithm with ratchet (Gallant, 1990) solves the stability problem of perceptron learning by keeping the best solution seen so far "in its pocket". The pocket algorithm then returns the solution in the pocket, rather than the last solution. It can be used also for non-separable data sets, where the aim is to find a perceptron with a small number of misclassifications. However, these solutions appear purely stochastically and hence the pocket algorithm neither approaches them gradually in the course of learning, nor are they guaranteed to show up within a given number of learning steps.

The Maxover algorithm (Wendemuth, 1995)&lt;ref&gt;A. Wendemuth. [http://www.iikt.ovgu.de/iesk_media/Downloads/ks/publications/papers/1995/wendemuth1995_learning_unlearnable-p-1452.pdf Learning the Unlearnable]. J. of Physics A: Math. Gen. 28: 5423-5436 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Robustness (computer science)|"robust"]] in the sense that it will converge regardless of (prior) knowledge of linear separability of the data set. In the linearly separable case, it will solve the training problem ‚Äì if desired, even with optimal stability ([[Hyperplane separation theorem|maximum margin]] between the classes). For non-separable data sets, it will return a solution with a small number of misclassifications. In all cases, the algorithm gradually approaches the solution in the course of learning, without memorizing previous states and without stochastic jumps. Convergence is to global optimality for separable data sets and to local optimality for non-separable data sets.

The Voted Perceptron (Freund and Schapire, 1999), is a variant using multiples weighted perceptrons. The algorithm starts a new perceptron every time an example is wrongly classified, initializing the weights vector with the final weights of the last perceptron. Each perceptron will also be given another weight corresponding to how many examples do they correctly classify before wrongly classifying one, and at the end the output will be a weighted vote on all perceptron.

In separable problems, perceptron training can also aim at finding the largest separating margin between the classes. The so-called perceptron of optimal stability can be determined by means of iterative training and optimization schemes, such as the Min-Over algorithm (Krauth and Mezard, 1987)&lt;ref name="KrauthMezard87"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  or the AdaTron (Anlauf and Biehl, 1989))
.&lt;ref&gt;J.K. Anlauf and M. Biehl. The AdaTron: an Adaptive Perceptron algorithm. Europhysics Letters 10: 687-692 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; AdaTron uses the fact that the corresponding quadratic optimization problem is convex. The perceptron of optimal stability, together with the [[kernel trick]], are the conceptual foundations of the [[support vector machine]].

The &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-perceptron further used a pre-processing layer of fixed random weights, with thresholded output units. This enabled the perceptron to classify [[:wiktionary:analogue|analogue]] patterns, by projecting them into a [[Binary Space Partition|binary space]]. In fact, for a projection space of sufficiently high dimension, patterns can become linearly separable.

Another way to solve nonlinear problems without using multiple layers is to use higher order networks ([[sigma-pi unit]]). In this type of network, each element in the input vector is extended with each pairwise combination of multiplied inputs (second order). This can be extended to an ''n''-order network.

It should be kept in mind, however, that the best classifier is not necessarily that which classifies all the training data perfectly. Indeed, if we had the prior constraint that the data come from equi-variant Gaussian distributions, the linear separation in the input space is optimal, and the nonlinear solution is [[overfitting|overfitted]].

Other linear classification algorithms include [[Winnow (algorithm)|Winnow]], [[support vector machine]] and [[logistic regression]].

== Multiclass perceptron ==
Like most other techniques for training linear classifiers, the perceptron generalizes naturally to [[multiclass classification]].  Here, the input &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the output &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are drawn from arbitrary sets. A feature representation function &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; maps each possible input/output pair to a finite-dimensional real-valued feature vector.  As before, the feature vector is multiplied by a weight vector &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, but now the resulting score is used to choose among many possible outputs:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat y = \operatorname{argmax}_y f(x,y) \cdot w.&lt;/math&gt;

Learning again iterates over the examples, predicting an output for each, leaving the weights unchanged when the predicted output matches the target, and changing them when it does not.  The update becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; w_{t+1} = w_t + f(x, y) - f(x,\hat y).&lt;/math&gt;

This multiclass feedback formulation reduces to the original perceptron when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued vector, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is chosen from &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = y x&lt;/math&gt;.

For certain problems, input/output representations and features can be chosen so that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{argmax}_y f(x,y) \cdot w&lt;/math&gt; can be found efficiently even though &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is chosen from a very large or even infinite set.

In recent years, perceptron training has become popular in the field of [[natural language processing]] for such tasks as [[part-of-speech tagging]] and [[syntactic parsing]] (Collins, 2002).

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Plant breeders' rights''' (PBR), also known as '''plant variety rights''' (PVR), are rights granted to the [[plant breeding|breeder]] of a new [[Plant variety (law)|variety]] of plant that give the breeder [[exclusive right|exclusive control]] over the propagating material (including [[seed]], cuttings, divisions, tissue culture) and harvested material (cut flowers, fruit, foliage) of a new variety for a number of years.

With these rights, the breeder can choose to become the exclusive marketer of the variety, or to license the variety to others. In order to qualify for these exclusive rights, a variety must be new, distinct, uniform and stable. A variety is:
* new if it has not been commercialized for more than one year in the country of protection;
* distinct if it differs from all other known varieties by one or more important botanical characteristics, such as height, maturity, color, etc.;
* uniform if the plant characteristics are consistent from plant to plant within the variety;
* stable if the plant characteristics are genetically fixed and therefore remain the same from generation to generation, or after a cycle of reproduction in the case of [[F1 hybrids|hybrid]] varieties.

The breeder must also give the variety an acceptable "denomination", which becomes its generic name and must be used by anyone who markets the variety.

Typically, plant variety rights are granted by national offices, after examination. Seed is submitted to the plant variety office, who grow it for one or more seasons, to check that it is distinct, stable, and uniform. If these tests are passed, exclusive rights are granted for a specified period (typically 20/25 years (or 25/30 years, for trees and vines). Annual renewal fees are required to maintain the rights.

Breeders can bring suit to enforce their rights and can recover damages for [[Intellectual property infringement|infringement]]. Plant breeders' rights contain exemptions from infringement that are not recognized under patent law. Commonly, there is an exemption for farm-saved seed. Farmers may store the production in their own bins for their own use as seed, but this does not necessarily extend to brown-bag sales of seed. Further sales for [[plant propagation|propagation]] purposes are not allowed without the written approval of the breeder. There is also a breeders' exemption (research exemption in the 1991 Act) that allows breeders to use protected varieties as sources of initial variation to create new varieties of plants (1978 Act),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Convention For The Protection Of New Varieties Of Plants of December 2, 1961, as revised at Geneva on November 10, 1972, and on October 23, 1978, UPOV Convention|url=http://www.upov.int/en/publications/conventions/1978/act1978.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626113944/http://www.upov.int/en/publications/conventions/1978/act1978.htm|archivedate=June 26, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for other experimental purposes (1991 Act).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Convention For The Protection Of New Varieties Of Plants of December 2, 1961, as Revised at Geneva on November 10, 1972, on October 23, 1978, and on March 19, 1991, UPOV Convention|url=http://www.upov.int/en/publications/conventions/1991/act1991.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821220927/http://www.upov.int/en/publications/conventions/1991/act1991.htm|archivedate=August 21, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a provision for [[compulsory licensing]] to assure public access to protected varieties if the national interest requires it and the breeder is unable to meet the demand.

There is tension over the relationship between patent rights and plant breeder's rights. There has been litigation in Australia, the United States, and Canada over the overlap between such rights.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Rimmer. "Franklin Barley Patent Law And Plant Breeders' Rights", Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law, December 2003, Vol. 10, No. 4, URL http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v10n4/rimmer104.html&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these cases was decided on the principle that patents and plant breeders' rights were overlapping and not mutually exclusive. Thus, the exemptions from infringement of plant breeders' rights, such as the saved seed exemption, do not create corresponding exemptions from infringement of the patents covering the same plants. Likewise, acts that infringe the plant breeders' rights, such as exportation of the variety, would not necessarily infringe a patent on the variety, which only allows the patent owner to prohibit making, using or selling the patented invention.

==International rights==
{{refimprove|date=November 2007}}

In 1957, in France negotiations took place concerned with the protection of new varieties. This led to the creation of the [[International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants|Union Internationale pour la Protection des Obtentions V√©g√©tales]] (UPOV) and adoption of the first text of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV Convention) in 1961. The purpose of the Convention was to ensure that the member states party to the Convention acknowledge the achievements of breeders of new plant varieties by making available to them an exclusive property right, on the basis of a set of uniform and clearly defined principles.

The Convention was revised in [[Geneva]] in 1972, 1978 and 1991. Both the 1978 and the 1991 Acts set out a minimum scope of protection and offer member States the possibility of taking national circumstances into account in their legislation. Under the 1978 Act, the minimum scope of the plant breeder's right requires that the holder's prior authorisation is necessary for the production for purposes of commercial marketing, the offering for sale and the marketing of propagating material of the protected variety. The 1991 Act contains more detailed provisions defining the acts concerning propagating material in relation to which the holder's authorisation is required. The breeder's authorisation is also required in relation to any of the specified acts done with harvested material of the variety, unless the breeder has had reasonable opportunity to exercise their right in relation to the propagating material, or if not doing so could constitute an "Omega Threat" situation. Under that provision, for example, a flower breeder who protects their variety in the Netherlands could block importation of cut flowers of that variety into the Netherlands from Egypt, which does not grant plant breeders' rights, because the breeder had no opportunity to exercise any rights in Egypt. Member countries also have the option to require the breeder's authorization with respect to the specified acts as applied to products directly obtained from the harvested material (such as flour or oil from grain, or juice from fruit), unless the breeder has had reasonable opportunity to exercise their right in relation to the harvested material.

The UPOV Convention also establishes a multilateral system of ''national treatment'', under which citizens of any member state are treated as citizens of all member states for the purpose of obtaining plant breeders rights.  It also sets up a multilateral priority filing system, under which an application for protection filed in one member state establishes a filing date for applications filed in all other member states within one year of that original filing date.  This allows a breeder to file in any one member country within the one-year period required to preserve the novelty of their variety, and the novelty of the variety will still be recognized when the filing is done in other member countries within one year of the original filing date. However, if the applicant does not wish to make use of priority filing, he or she has four years in which to apply in all other member states, excepting the United States, for all species except tree and vine species in which case he or she has six years to make application. More information can be obtained in Article 10 (1) (b) of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2100/94 of 27 July 2004. The trigger to start the four- or six-year period is not actually the date on which the first filing is made but the date on which the variety was first commercialised.

The UPOV Convention is not [[Self-executing right|self-executing]].  Each member state must adopt legislation consistent with the requirements of the convention and submit that legislation to the UPOV Secretariat for review and approval by the UPOV Council, which consists of all the UPOV member states acting in committee.  In compliance with these treaty obligations, the United Kingdom enacted the [[Plant Variety and Seeds Act 1964]]. Similar legislation was passed in the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, and New Zealand. In 1970 the United States followed the lead of seventeen [[Western European]] nations and passed the [[Plant Variety Protection Act]] 1970 (US). This legislation provided protection to developers of novel, sexually reproduced plants.  However, the United States originally acceded to the UPOV Convention on the basis of the Plant Patent Act and did not bring the PVP Act into compliance with UPOV requirements until 1984 when the Commissioner of Plant Variety Protection promulgated rules to do so.  Since the 1980s, the US Patent Office has granted patents on plants, including plant varieties this provides a second way of protecting plant varieties in the United States.  Australia passed the Plant Variety Protection Act 1987 (Cth) and the [[Plant Breeders Rights Act]] 1994 (Cth). Australian patent law also permits the patenting of plant varieties.  In total, 65 countries have signed the UPOV Convention and adopted plant breeders' rights legislation consistent with the requirements of the convention.

The [[WTO]]'s [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPs) requires member states to provide protection for plant varieties either by [[patent]]s or by an effective ''sui generis'' (stand alone) system, or a combination of the two.  Most countries meet this requirement through UPOV Convention-compliant legislation.  India has adopted a plant breeders' rights law that has been rejected by the UPOV Council as not meeting the requirements of the treaty.

The most recent 1991 [[International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants|UPOV]] convention established several restrictions upon international plant breeders‚Äô rights. While the current legislature of the convention recognizes novel varieties of plants as [[intellectual property]], laws were formed concerning the preservation of seeds for future plantation, such that the need to buy seeds to use in subsequent planting seasons would be significantly reduced, and even potentially eliminated altogether.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, the 1991 convention also concerns the method of instigating plant breeding by implementing pre-existing and [[patent]]ed plant species as contributor of vital genetic information in the creation of what would legally be regarded as a new variety of plant.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fister|first=Karin|last2=Fister|first2=Iztok|last3=Murovec|first3=Jana|last4=Bohanec|first4=Borut|date=2017-02-01|title=DNA labelling of varieties covered by patent protection: a new solution for managing intellectual property rights in the seed industry|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11248-016-9981-1|journal=Transgenic Research|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=87‚Äì95|doi=10.1007/s11248-016-9981-1|issn=0962-8819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constituent countries of the [[World Trade Organization]] are required to acknowledge the creation of new varieties of plants, and to uphold these creations within full recognition of intellectual property rights laws. A formalized legislature, exemplifying the manner in which such intellectual property rights can be conferred, is demonstrated by the 1991 [[International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants|UPOV]] convention, which declares such rights upon an individual breeder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This document further identifies a breeder as one who has found or created a plant variety, one who possesses legal authority for the contractual production of a new plant variety, or one who has inherited legal rights to this form of  intellectual property as it was derived under either of the two aforementioned conditions.

As a result of debate over the protection of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] plants as new varieties, the legal measure of double protection, as expressed within the current iteration of the [[UPOV]], can be taken.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Stephen|last2=Lence|first2=Sergio|last3=Hayes|first3=Dermot|last4=Alston|first4=Julian|last5=Corona|first5=Eloy|date=2016-07-08|title=Elements of Intellectual Property Protection in Plant Breeding and Biotechnology: Interactions and Outcomes|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/cs/abstracts/56/4/1401|journal=Crop Science|language=en|volume=56|issue=4|doi=10.2135/cropsci2015.10.0608|issn=0011-183X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Double protection mediates the overlap between plant breeders‚Äô rights and patents that exists within the purview of intellectual property rights law, by enabling the protections of both to be conferred upon a particular plant variety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Plants as Intellectual Property ==
There have been contrary opinions expressed by both lawyers and scientists assessing the general necessity, if one exists, for the official protection of plants as a form of intellectual property.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kloppenburg|first=Jack|date=2014-11-02|title=Re-purposing the master's tools: the open source seed initiative and the struggle for seed sovereignty|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2013.875897|journal=The Journal of Peasant Studies|volume=41|issue=6|pages=1225‚Äì1246|doi=10.1080/03066150.2013.875897|issn=0306-6150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/book/10.1201/b16352|title=OMICS Applications in Crop Science|date=2013-11-27|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781466585256|doi=10.1201/b16352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, intellectual property rights protect ideas that can be demonstrated as being novel and undiscovered at the time of its legal claim as intellectual property.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This definition of novelty, however, has been flexible throughout the history of intellectual property law, both internationally, and within the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jondle|first=Robert J.|last2=Hill|first2=Krista K.|last3=Sanny|first3=Tony|date=2015-11-12|title=Current Legal Issues in Intellectual Property Rights and Protection for Crop Plants|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/cs/abstracts/55/6/2496|journal=Crop Science|language=en|volume=55|issue=6|doi=10.2135/cropsci2014.10.0693|issn=0011-183X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palombi|first=Luigi|date=2014-06-30|title=The Patenting of Biological Materials in the United States: A State of Policy Confusion|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/POSC_a_00158|journal=Perspectives on Science|volume=23|issue=1|pages=35‚Äì65|doi=10.1162/POSC_a_00158|issn=1063-6145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expectations of future changes to the legal protection of plant-related forms of intellectual property differ from the legal requirements for the first plant patent.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Robert C. ‚ÄúThe First Plant Patent.‚Äù Journal of the Patent Office Society 14 (1932): 398‚Äì403.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mewburn.com/resource/article-future-of-protecting-plant-related-innovations/|title=Article: Future of protecting plant related innovations - Mewburn Ellis|work=Mewburn Ellis|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of these laws recognize an overarching need for the financial support of research and development.

A specific concern within this argument is with the means by which seeds are accessed within different local and international regions.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Recognizing that this process is extremely transient in nature and can vary greatly over time, supporters of this argument purport that this diversity must be reflected within intellectual property rights laws in order for them to exist as an effective protection of plant breeders‚Äô rights.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

As a result of this conflict concerning authority over seeds, new legislation has been implemented in the United States.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Open Source Seed Initiative]] (OSSI) is a national attempt that has been introduced within the United States, and is the first of its kind to model its approach regarding plant breeders‚Äô rights upon the mechanisms implemented by openly sourced software mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Subsequent discourse on this approach has arisen, as concerns with the use of open source technology within a legal framework have developed. Some perceive OSSI as having significantly limited plant breeders‚Äô ability to access intellectual property rights for new plant varieties.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This has resulted in claims that funding for research and development in this sector will also decline.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Pok√©mon Ranger'''''|„Éù„Ç±„É¢„É≥„É¨„É≥„Ç∏„É£„Éº|Pok√©mon RenjƒÅ}} is an [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[HAL Laboratory]] and [[Creatures (company)|Creatures Inc.]], published by [[The Pok√©mon Company]] and distributed by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] [[video game console]]. The game was released at various dates, varying between continents. The game was released in Japan on March 23, 2006; in North America and Australia during 2006 and in Europe in April 2007. It was released on the European Wii U Virtual Console on February 25, 2016.

''Pok√©mon Ranger'' is compatible with [[Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok√©mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']], ''[[Pok√©mon Platinum|Platinum]]'', [[Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']] allowing players to transfer the egg of the [[legendary Pok√©mon]] [[Manaphy]] to those games. This game is set in the Fiore region.

==Gameplay==
''Pok√©mon Ranger'' is a [[role-playing game]] which is designed in a format radically different from that of traditional [[Pok√©mon]] RPGs. The player controls a Pok√©mon Ranger in the Fiore region and catches Pok√©mon, temporarily, by using a device called a "capture styler", which is controlled by the stylus. The storyline of the game is set out in 10 main missions with three sub-missions. The only Pok√©mon that travels permanently with the player is a [[Minun]] if the player chooses the male hero or [[Plusle]] if the player chooses the female hero. The player must loop the Pok√©mon with the "styler" a certain amount of times to capture them. Pok√©mon may attempt to flee the styler or attack it. The styler has an energy bar that is similar to an HP counter for Pok√©mon on the other Pok√©mon adventure games, when the energy bar of the styler is completely depleted, the player is transported to the last save terminal. The styler can be recharged in a Pok√©mon center like manner at a ranger base, save points are in the bases and scattered throughout the game. There is a quick save option to use in emergencies when a save port can't be found or is too far away. Temporarily caught Pok√©mon can be used in the field to accomplish tasks and solve puzzles by cutting, tackling, shooting fire, blowing water, etc. They can also be used to enhance the styler's loop line. For example, if a water Pok√©mon is selected to aid in capturing a new Pok√©mon, the styler will produce a temporary bubble that immobilizes the target, preventing it from attacking or fleeing.

==Plot==

===Setting===
''Pok√©mon Ranger'' is set in the Fiore region. The region's name originates from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word for [[wiktionary:fiore|flower]]. The Go-Rock Squad is the resident crime syndicate of this region. Fiore itself does not have any native Pok√©mon, but has many Pok√©mon from other regions. It also does not have any [[Pok√©mon Trainer]]s. All people who live with Pok√©mon keep them outside of [[Pok√© Ball]]s, like pets, as Pok√©mon are never trained here. Fiore is located quite some distance from the other regions of the Pok√©mon world up to the third generation. It is a relatively small island region that is quite mountainous. There are four major settlements in Fiore, each named after the season it constantly experiences ‚Äî Ringtown (spring) to the west, Fall City (fall) to the east, Wintown (winter) at foot of mountains to the north and Summerland (summer) on an island to the south. The Krokka Tunnel connects Fall City and Ringtown. From there, one can also get to the Panula Cave, which is also accessible from Summerland's harbor via water vehicle (aka the AquaMole), the coldest spot of  the Fiore region, hence ice Pok√©mon appearing there, including the legendary Regice. It leads to Wintown, located on the foot of the Sekra Range. The Sekra Range is a {{convert|6500|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} mountain range that is notable for having a waterfall that can "fill the Capture Arena 23 times in one minute"; housing the Go-Rock Squad's base; a house high up where the residents inside will recharge the player's Styler; "Shiftree", a tree where five [[Shiftry]] live in and will attack the player all at the same time; and the Fiore Temple, an ancient temple mountain currently home to a lot of wild Pok√©mon, but with a strange door that will only open when you capture the 3 wanted Pok√©mon; where the game's climax takes place, located at the very summit of the Sekra Range. On the same island where Summerland is located on is a big jungle called the Olive Jungle. Numerous Bug- and Grass-type Pok√©mon live here, and in the center is a ruin, with the same symbols on [[Kyogre]], called the Jungle Relic. In the past, Rangers came to the Relic to test themselves. There are four Challenges involving Dragon Pok√©mon, each representing one of the four [[classical elements]]: the Challenge of Destruction (Earth), the Challenge of Wind (Air), the Challenge of Fire and the Challenge of Water. These Pok√©mon are Flygon, Salamence, Charizard, and Kingdra respectively, as on the cover of ''Pok√©mon Ranger''. It is said that should all four be cleared, a catastrophe will befall Fiore. After beating the game, the player may roam around free to do almost anything. There is also the Ranger Net for special missions after the main missions.  In these missions, the main character is required to capture 3 legendary Pok√©mon not seen anywhere else in the game; [[Deoxys]], [[Celebi (Pok√©mon)|Celebi]], and [[Mew (Pok√©mon)|Mew]]. If the code for the special Manaphy mission is unlocked, it can be used to get the Manaphy Egg, which can later be transferred to [[Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok√©mon Diamond'', ''Pearl'', and ''Platinum'']].

===Characters===
The storyline revolves around a single Pok√©mon Ranger ‚Äî Lunick or Solana, depending on the player's choice. In addition to the protagonist characters in the game, several other Pok√©mon Rangers are part of the Ranger Union. Each ranger leader holds domain over that town's rangers. These rangers are named Cameron, Elita, Joel, and Spenser. A professor named Professor Hastings also plays a significant role in the game, as the Chief of Technology for the Ranger Union. The new villainous group, the Go-Rock Squad, has four sub-leaders called the Go-Rock Quads, the leader's three sons and daughter. The Quads have a motto they repeat every time they are encountered. Their original plot is to use the Super Styler, a more powerful version of the original Styler that resembles an organ, to take control of [[Entei]], [[Suicune]], and [[Raikou]] to attack citizens of Fiore. They would then command them to stop, leading people to believe the Go-Rock Squad were heroes. They would afterwards command Pok√©mon to start other problems and charge money to solve the problem. The player is then required to prove their worth in three extra post ending missions and capture the enraged legendaries; [[Kyogre]], [[Groudon]], and [[Rayquaza]].

==Development==
Information regarding ''Pok√©mon Ranger'' was published in the July 2005 issue of ''[[CoroCoro Comic]]'' magazine. Little details were shared, which mostly hinted that it was a game and a movie. An announcement on ''Pok√©mon Ranger'' came as a short teaser at the end of the 8th Pok√©mon film, ''[[Pok√©mon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]''. This game's development was confused for being the same game as ''[[Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon]]''.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

===Promotion===
A few episodes of the ''Pok√©mon'' animated series have included Pok√©mon Rangers. They go on special missions to help preserve Pok√©mon and human relations, and they are closely related to Pok√©mon breeders. They also have a device that allows them to temporarily control wild Pok√©mon; this device also allows them to scan Pok√©mon, check how healthy they are, and make sure that they are not being interfered with by outside forces. Solana herself has appeared in three episodes of the ''Pok√©mon'' anime. One of which Solona must stop a disturbed Deoxys.

Several Pok√©mon Rangers can also be battled in [[Pok√©mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok√©mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']], [[Pok√©mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']], ''[[Pok√©mon Emerald|Emerald]]'', [[Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']], ''[[Pok√©mon Platinum|Platinum]]'', [[Pok√©mon Black and White|''Black'' and ''White'']] and are depicted as protecting the environment and wild Pok√©mon. These Rangers own Pok√©mon which they keep in Pok√© Balls, and are not true rangers but still have similar intentions to true Pok√©mon Rangers.

A direct-to-DVD animated film adaptation ''[[Pok√©mon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea]]'' premi√®red on [[Cartoon Network]] on March 23, 2007 and released on DVD the succeeding month. The movie starred a new Ranger named Jack Walker, or Jackie, whose job is to protect a Legendary Manaphy Egg which Ash and company also help in protecting.

===Merchandise===
A game watch has been manufactured in the theme of ''Pok√©mon Ranger''. The watch is designed to look like the Pok√©mon Rangers' Capture Styler used for capturing Pok√©mon. The Pok√©mon can be used to help the styler by making bubbles or having leaf blades shoot out or having it on fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/game/docs/20060116/whf04.htm|title=„Çπ„ÇØ„É™„Éº„É≥„Ç∑„Éß„ÉÉ„Éà|publisher=Watch.impress.co.jp|date=|accessdate=2008-10-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509001737/http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/game/docs/20060116/whf04.htm|archivedate=2006-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He cites the dialogue and story, commenting that while ''Pok√©mon'' was a kiddy game, the writing in ''Ranger'' is worse than in the main games. Fellow [[Retronauts]] contributor Justin Haywald criticized [[HAL Laboratory]], which he says is normally a good developer, for making ''Ranger''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/podcast.the1upnetwork.com/flat/Retronauts/R030611.mp3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6E9wUJBlg?url=http://podcast.the1upnetwork.com/flat/Retronauts/R030611.mp3 |archivedate=2013-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pope John XIV''' ({{lang-la|Ioannes XIV}}; died 20 August 984) was [[Pope]] from December 983 to his death in 984. He was the successor to [[Pope Benedict VII]].

John XIV was born at [[Pavia]], and before his elevation to the papal chair was imperial Archchancellor for Italy of Emperor [[Otto II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=John XIV (pope)|display=John XIV.|volume=15|page=435}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His earliest document in that capacity dates from 28 December 980, and the latest from 27 August 983.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Schwart (1907), [https://archive.org/details/MN42020ucmf_1 ''Die Besetzung der Bist√ºmer Reichsitaliens unter den s√§chsischen und salischen Kaisern: mit den Listen der Bisch√∂fe, 951-1122'' (Leipzig: B.G. Teubner) (in German), p.&amp;nbsp;142.&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Adelheid of Burgundy, the wife of Otto II, and Queen Theano his wife, on behalf of Otto III, wished to make [[Majolus of Cluny]] pope in 983, but he refused, and Pietro Canepanova, Bishop of Pavia, was chosen instead.&lt;ref&gt;J. N. D. Kelly, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Popes'' (Oxford 1986), "John XIV", p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

His original name was Pietro Canepanova,&lt;ref&gt;George L. Williams, ''Papal Genealogy: The Families And Descendants Of The Popes'', (McFarland &amp; Company, 1998), 232.&lt;/ref&gt; but he [[papal name|took the name]] John XIV to [[Pope Peter II|avoid being linked]] to [[St. Peter]] himself.

Otto II died shortly after his election, his heir [[Otto III]], being only 3&amp;nbsp;years old and unable to protect John's position as Pope. [[Antipope Boniface VII]] (974, 984‚Äì985), on the strength of the popular feeling against the new Pope, returned from [[Constantinople]] and placed John XIV in prison in the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], where he died either from starvation or poison.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Shipley Duckett, ''Death and Life in the Tenth Century'', (University of Michigan Press, 1967), 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been considerable confusion of the [[pope John (numbering)|number of Popes John]]. There was only the one John XIV. However, by the 13th century, clerical authorities in the Vatican came to wrongly believe that there were two John XIVs and began to double-count John XIV accordingly. This led to a pope calling himself [[Pope John XXI|John XXI]], instead of John XX, in 1276.

In business, engineering, and manufacturing, '''quality''' has a pragmatic interpretation as the non-inferiority or superiority of something; it's also defined as being suitable for its intended purpose (fitness for purpose) while satisfying customer expectations. Quality is a perceptual, conditional, and somewhat subjective attribute and may be understood differently by different people.&lt;ref name="NandaQuality16"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guizsuAAyR4C&amp;pg=PA1 |title=Quality Management System Handbook for Product Development Companies |author=Nanda, V. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=352 |year=2016 |isbn=9781420025309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GitlowQuality00"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5aq0HMyXOcC&amp;pg=PA1 |title=Quality Management Systems: A Practical Guide |author=Gitlow, H.S. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=296 |year=2000 |isbn=9781574442618}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers may focus on the [[Acceptance testing|specification quality]] of a product/service, or how it compares to competitors in the marketplace. Producers might measure the [[Conformance testing|conformance quality]], or degree to which the product/service was produced correctly. Support personnel may measure quality in the degree that a product is [[wikt:reliable|reliable]], [[Maintainability|maintainable]], or [[Sustainability|sustainable]].

==Description==
There are many aspects of quality in a business context, though primary is the idea the business [[Production (economics)|produces]] something, whether it be a physical good or a particular service. These goods and/or services and how they are produced involve many types of processes, procedures, equipment, personnel, and investments, which all fall under the quality umbrella. Key aspects of quality and how it's diffused throughout the business are rooted in the concept of [[quality management]]:&lt;ref name="NandaQuality16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GitlowQuality00" /&gt;

# Quality [[planning]] - Quality planning is implemented as a means of "developing the products, systems, and processes needed to meet or exceed customer expectations."&lt;ref name="NandaQuality16" /&gt; This includes defining who the customers are, determining their needs, and developing the tools (systems, processes, etc.) needed to meet those needs.
# [[Quality assurance]] ‚Äì Quality assurance is implemented as a means of providing enough confidence that business requirements and goals (as outlined in quality planning) for a product and/or service will be fulfilled. This error prevention is done through systematic measurement, comparison with a standard, and monitoring of processes.
# [[Quality control]] ‚Äì Quality control (QC) is implemented as a means of fulfilling quality requirements, reviewing all factors involved in production. The business confirms that the good or service produced meets organizational goals, often using tools such as [[operational auditing]] and [[inspection]]. QC is focused on process output.
# [[Quality improvement]] - Quality improvement is implemented as a means of providing mechanisms for the evaluation and improvement of processes, etc. in the light of their efficiency, effectiveness, and flexibility. This may be done with noticeably significant changes or incrementally via [[Continual improvement process|continual improvement]].

While quality management and its tenets are relatively recent phenomena, the idea of quality in business is not new. In the early 1900s, pioneers such as Frederick Winslow Taylor and Henry Ford recognized the limitations of the methods being used in mass production at the time and the subsequent varying quality of output, implementing quality control, inspection, and standardization procedures in their work.&lt;ref name="PappQuality14"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1akTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3 |title=Quality Management in the Imaging Sciences |author=Papp, J. |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |pages=372 |year=2014 |isbn=9780323261999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodHenry03"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XXxhbDU9P4C&amp;pg=PA300 |title=Henry Ford: Critical Evaluations in Business and Management |editor1=Wood, J.C.|editor2=Wood, M.C. |publisher=Taylor and Francis |volume=1 |pages=384 |year=2003 |isbn=9780415248259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the twentieth century, the likes of [[William Edwards Deming]] and [[Joseph M. Juran]] helped take quality to new heights, initially in Japan and later (in the late '70s and early '80s) globally.&lt;ref name="GitlowQuality00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASQTotal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/history-of-quality/overview/total-quality.html |title=Total Quality |work=Learn About Quality |publisher=American Society for Quality |accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Customers recognize that quality is an important attribute in products and services, and suppliers recognize that quality can be an important differentiator between their own offerings and those of competitors (the quality gap). In the past two decades this quality gap has been gradually decreasing between competitive products and services. This is partly due to the contracting (also called outsourcing) of manufacturing to countries like China and India, as well internationalization of trade and competition. These countries, among many others, have raised their own standards of quality in order to meet international standards and customer demands.&lt;ref name="HagertyBad13"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/12/13/bad-news-for-u-s-industry-china-is-closing-the-quality-gap/ |title=Bad News for U.S. Industry: China is Closing the Quality Gap |author=Hagerty, J.R. |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=13 December 2013 |accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShirouzuChina17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos/china-carmakers-narrow-quality-gap-on-global-rivals-report-idUSKCN1C30HY |title=China carmakers narrow quality gap on global rivals: Report |author=Shirouzu, N. |work=Reuters |date=28 September 2017 |accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ISO 9000]] series of standards are probably the best known international standards for quality management, though specialized standards such as [[ISO 15189]] (for medical laboratories) and [[ISO 14000|ISO 14001]] (for environmental management) also exist.&lt;ref name="ASQWhatIs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/quality-management-system/ |title=What Is A Quality Management System (QMS)?

===Notable definitions===
[[File:The_triad_constraints.jpg|thumb|The [[project management triangle]] view on quality]]

The definition of "quality" has changed over time, and even today some variance is found in how it is described.&lt;ref name="NandaQuality16" /&gt; However, some commonality can still be found. The common element of the business definitions is that the quality of a product or service refers to the perception of the degree to which the product or service meets the customer's expectations. Quality has no specific meaning unless related to a specific function and/or object.

The business meanings of ''quality'' have developed over time. Various interpretations are given below:
# [[American Society for Quality]]: "A combination of quantitative and qualitative perspectives for which each person has his or her own definition; examples of which include, "Meeting the [[requirements]] and expectations in service or product that were committed to" and "Pursuit of optimal solutions contributing to confirmed successes, fulfilling accountabilities".  In technical usage, quality can have two meanings:
#:a. The characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs;
#:b. A product or service free of deficiencies."&lt;ref name="ASQglossaryQ" /&gt;

==Market sector perspectives==
===Operations management===
Traditionally, quality acts as one of five operations/project performance objectives dictated by [[operations management]] policy. Operations management, by definition, focuses on the most effective and efficient ways for creating and delivering a good or service that satisfies customer needs and expectations.&lt;ref name="HoOperations99"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bTUtd2R5LeYC&amp;pg=PA1 |title=Operations and Quality Management |author=Ho, S.K.M. |publisher=International Thomson Business Press |year=1999 |pages=323 |isbn=9781861523983}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, its ties to quality are apparent. The five performance objectives which give business a way to measure their operational performance are:&lt;ref name="SlackOperations07"&gt;{{cite book |title=Operations Management |author=Slack, N.; Chambers, S.; Johnston, R. |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=5th |pages=728 |year=2007 |isbn=9780273708476}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GreasleyOperations07"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7m8VJP0I_ksC&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Operations Management |author=Greasley, A. |publisher=SAGE |pages=176 |year=2007 |isbn=9781849202374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* quality, measuring how well a product or service conforms to specifications;
* speed (or [[Response time (technology)|response time]]), measuring the delay between customer request and customer receipt of a product or service;
* [[dependability]], measuring how consistently a product or service can be delivered to meet customer expectation;
* [[Labour market flexibility|flexibility]], measuring how quickly the business can adapt to a variety of market changes; and
* [[cost]], measuring the resources (and by extension, financed) required to plan, deliver, and improve the finished good or service.

Based on an earlier model called the sand cone model, these objectives support each other, with quality at the base.&lt;ref name="HillEncyclo12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=scyoDm8zGX0C&amp;pg=PA312 |chapter=sand cone model |title=The Encyclopedia of Operations Management: A Field Manual and Glossary of Operations Management Terms and Concepts |editor1=Hill, A.V.|editor2=Render, B. |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc |year=2012 |page=312 |isbn=9780132883733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GreasleyOperations07" /&gt; By extension, quality increases dependability, reduces cost, and increases customer satisfaction.&lt;ref name="GreasleyOperations07" /&gt;

===Manufacturing===
The early 1920s saw a slow but gradual movement among manufacturers away from a "maximum production" philosophy to one aligned more closely with "positive and continuous control of quality to definite standards in the factory."&lt;ref name="RadfordTheControl22"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7zAwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3 |title=The Control of Quality in Manufacturing |author=Radford, G.S. |publisher=Ronald Press Company |year=1922 |pages=404}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodHenry03" /&gt; That standardization, further pioneered by Deming and Juran later in the twentieth century,&lt;ref name="GitlowQuality00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASQTotal" /&gt; has become deeply integrated into how manufacturing businesses operate today.

===Service sector===
The push to integrate the concept of quality into the functions of the service industry takes a slightly different path from manufacturing. Where manufacturers focus on "tangible, visible, persistent issues," many ‚Äî but not all ‚Äî quality aspects of the service provider's output are intangible and fleeting.&lt;ref name="BeckfordQuality02"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eh-YmQSY7bcC&amp;pg=PA12 |title=Quality |author=Beckford, J. |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2002 |edition=2nd |pages=328 |isbn=9780415259194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SoodStrat17"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QW9xDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67 |chapter=Marketing of Services: New Paradigm and Perspectives |title=Strategic Marketing Management and Tactics in the Service Industry |author=Matthew, V. |editor=Sood, T. |publisher=IGI Global |pages=43‚Äì73 |year=2017 |isbn=9781522524762}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeanBureau12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FkjzCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12 |chapter=Bureau of Labor Statistics Productivity Measures for Service Industries |title=The Service Productivity and Quality Challenge |author=Dean, E.R.; Kunze, K. |editor=Harker, P.T. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=11‚Äì42 |year=2012 |isbn=9789401100731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other obstacles include management's perceptions not aligning with customer expectations due to lack of communication and market research and the improper or lack of delivery of skill-based knowledge to personnel.&lt;ref name="BeckfordQuality02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SoodStrat17" /&gt; Like manufacturing, customer expectations are key in the service industry, though the degree with which the service interacts with the customer definitely shapes perceived service quality.

'''Robert Jefferson Bingham''' (bapt. 7 March 1824  ‚Äì 21 February 1870) was an English pioneer photographer, mainly active in France, making portraits and reproductions of paintings. He is one of the first photographers to use and write about the [[collodion process]], which he claimed to have invented.&lt;ref name=Boyer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyer|first1=Laure|title=Robert J. Bingham, photographe du monde de l‚Äôart sous le Second Empire|journal=Etudes Photographiques|date=November 2002|issue=12|url=http://etudesphotographiques.revues.org/320?lang=en|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
Bingham was born in [[Billesdon]], [[Leicestershire]], England, where he was baptised in March 1824. His parents were John Cowener Bingham and his wife, Martha.&lt;ref&gt;''England, Select Births and Christenings, 1538-1975''&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1853, at the British Embassy in Paris, he married Emma Reeve, daughter of surgeon John Reed of [[Kinver]], Staffordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marriages |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000150/18530806/022/0005 |accessdate=23 July 2018 |work=Worcester Journal |date=6 August 1853 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died 15 years later at their home on rue de La Rochefoucauld in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deaths |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000609/18681026/084/0007 |accessdate=23 July 2018 |work=London Evening Standard |date=26 October 1868 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bingham first started working as a chemist at the [[London Institution]].&lt;ref name=Boyer/&gt; In 1847, he published a new edition of ''Photogenic manipulation'', containing the theory and plain instructions in the art of photography", a work that would be expanded and reprinted at least four times over the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photogenic manipulation|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/photogenic-manipulation/oclc/532171/editions?start_edition=1&amp;sd=asc&amp;referer=di&amp;se=yr&amp;qt=sort_yr_asc&amp;editionsView=true&amp;fq=|publisher=Worldcat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He showed 19 photographs at [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851, and was commissioned, as a result of the influence of [[Henry Cole]],a member of the Executive Committee, to print the glass plate negatives by Claude-Marie Ferrier of prize winning exhibits as illustrations for the photographically-illustrated presentation copies of the Report by the Juries.  Bingham set up a photographic printing establishment in Versailles in order to undertake this contract. Some of the photographs and others by Bingham were shown in 1852 at the exhibition [[Recent Specimens of Photography]] held at the [[Royal Society of Arts|Society of Arts]], London, the first exhibition to focus solely on photography.&lt;ref name=Boyer/&gt;

Bingham also made photographs of the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle of 1855]] in Paris. His ability to take some 2500 photographs at relatively high speeds on this occasion encouraged other photographers to use the [[collodion process]] for their work as well, helping it become the most popular method from 1855 until about 1880.&lt;ref name=Hannavy/&gt; Henry Cole sent him at the same time to the [[Louvre Museum|Louvre]] to photograph the masterpieces of the museum collection. At some point in 1851&lt;ref name=Hannavy/&gt; 1855,&lt;ref name=Boyer/&gt; or 1859,&lt;ref name=NPG&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Jefferson Bingham (1825-1870)|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp14631/robert-jefferson-bingham?role=art|website=National Portrait Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bingham moved to Paris to work there as a photographer, at first together with the American [[Warren T. Thompson]] until Thompson returned to England in 1856. Bingham not only worked at the 1855 Exposition, but also displayed his own life-size portraits, for which he won a Medal First Class. Due to a lack of commercial success, however, he soon stopped producing these huge photographs and stuck to more standard formats.&lt;ref name=Boyer/&gt;

His work at the Louvre inspired him to make photographic portraiture a commercial enterprise, and in 1857 he opened his new atelier in the [[Nouvelle Ath√®nes]] quarter of Paris, one of the hotspots of artistic activity at the time. He became friends with many artists, photographing them and their works, and started  on a new project, a photographic collection of the works of the recently deceased painter [[Paul Delaroche]]. Published in 1858, it was the first photographic [[catalogue raisonn√©]].&lt;ref name=Hannavy&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hannavy|first1=John|title=Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135873271|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kd5cAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA549&amp;lpg=PA549&amp;dq=first+photographic+%22catalogue+raisonn%C3%A9%22+bingham}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed over the next few years by similar works about other artists, including one in 1860 on [[Ary Scheffer]] and another one with photographs of the major works of the 1860 [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]]. Smaller works with only a handful of photographs were produced for particular collections and for the [[Mus√©e de Picardie|Napoleon Museum]] in [[Amiens]].&lt;ref name=Boyer/&gt;

His reproductions of paintings were famed for their suggestion of the original colours in the black-and-white photographs, and were lauded as being far superior to all other similar efforts until then. [[Gustave Moreau]] used to send photographs of his paintings, made by Bingham, to people to inform them of his latest creations, without the need to wait for a Salon or other exhibition. Similarly, [[Gustave Courbet]] showed his paintings, which were rejected for the Salon, through photographs made by Bingham. His 1863 work "Retour de conf√©rence", which was even rejected at the [[Salon des Refus√©s]], was destroyed by a fundamentalist Christian, making the photographs by Bingham the only remaining trace of it. But the public outrage about the painting was so great that the government had the negatives destroyed in 1867 as well. Courbet's 1864 "V√©nus et Psych√©" has disappeared as well and is also only known through Bingham's photographs.&lt;ref name=Boyer/&gt;

Bingham continued to exhibit in Great Britain and France, winning another medal at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] in London. He was one of the leading members of the [[Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de photographie]], contributing a lot of works to their exhibitions. Early in 1870, he suddenly left Paris for Brussels, where he died in February of that year. His atelier remained open until 1875, publishing more reproductions of his negatives.&lt;ref name=Boyer/&gt;

==Collodion process controversy==
The invention of the [[collodion process]], the most common process for photography between 1855 and 1881, is usually given to [[Frederick Scott Archer]], who published the method to achieve this in 1851, and said to have invented it as early as 1848. Another candidate was [[Gustave Le Gray]], who published another, less practical collodion process in 1850. But until the end of his life, Bingham proudly proclaimed that he was the first to have written about the collodion process, either in his 1848 book&lt;ref name=NPG/&gt; or in the January 1850 edition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bingham|first1=Robert Jefferson|title=Photogenic Manipulation: Containing the Theory and Plain Instructions in the Art of Photography, Or the Production of Pictures Through the Agency of Light: Including Calotype, Flurotype, Ferrotype, Chromotype, Chrysotype, Cyanotype, Catalistotype and Anthotype.

{{nihongo|'''Rodan'''|„É©„Éâ„É≥|Radon|lead=yes}} is a [[Kaiju|daikaiju]] monster which first appeared as the title character in [[Toho]]'s 1956 film ''[[Rodan (film)|Rodan]]''. Though the character started off in its own stand-alone film, Rodan was later featured in the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' franchise]]. [[IGN]] listed Rodan as #6 on their "Top 10 Japanese Movie Monsters" list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/15/top-10-japanese-movie-monsters?page=1|title=Top 10 Japanese Movie Monsters|last=Hawker|first=Tom|work=IGN|date=May 15, 2014|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' listed the character as #15 on its "The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time" list.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Robertson, [http://uk.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/05/most-badass-kaiju-monsters-of-all-time/ "The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time"], ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' (May 18, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

===Name===
The Japanese name ''Radon'' is a contraction of ''[[Pteranodon|Pte'''ra'''no'''don''']]''.

It was changed to ''Rodan'' for English-speaking markets in order to avoid confusion with the element [[radon]].&lt;ref name="sequart"&gt;{{Cite web | author=Harry Edmundson-Cornell | access-date= | url=http://sequart.org/magazine/56195/rodan/ | title=Tsuburaya Does Colour: Rodan | work=[[Sequart Organization]] | date=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''[[Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla II]]'', the English version of the film used the original name ''Radon''.

===Development===
As with [[Godzilla]], writer [[Ken Kuronuma]] turned to prehistoric animals for inspiration in developing the character, though unlike the former, whose species is largely left ambiguous, Rodan is explicitly stated to be a kind of ''[[Pteranodon]]''.&lt;ref name="sequart"/&gt; Just as Godzilla was conceived as a symbol of an American nuclear threat, Rodan was seen as an embodiment of the same danger originating from the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Jess-Cooke, C. (2009), ''Film Sequels: Theory and Practice from Hollywood to Bollywood'', Edinburgh University Press, p. 38, {{ISBN|0748689478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodan's debut appearance was the first and only time the character was given a [[Chestnut (color)|chestnut]] color. It originally had a menacing face with a jagged fanged beak, which would disappear in later incarnations as the character became more heroic. Rodan was portrayed via a combination of [[suitmation]] and wire-operated puppets for flight sequences. During suitmation sequences, Rodan was portrayed by [[Haruo Nakajima]], who almost drowned when the wires holding the 150 lb suit above a water tank snapped.&lt;ref name="sequart"/&gt; In ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'', the Rodan suit was of visibly lesser quality than the previous one, having a more comical face, a thick neck which barely concealed the shape of the performer's head within, and triangular wings.&lt;ref name="ryfle1998.1"/&gt; The modification of the character's face was deliberate, as Rodan was meant to be a slapstick character rather than the tragic villain seen in its film debut.&lt;ref name="kalat77"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series|date=2010|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-47-49-7|pages=77|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new suit was constructed for ''[[Invasion of Astro-Monster]]'' which more closely resembled the first, having more rounded wings and a sleeker face. The sleek face was retained in ''[[Destroy All Monsters]]'', though the wings and chest area were crudely designed.&lt;ref name="ryfle1998.1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan‚Äôs Favorite Mon-Star: The Unauthorized Biography of the Big G |last=Ryfle |first=S. |year=1998 |publisher=Toronto: ECW Press |isbn=1550223488 |pages=116 &amp; 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodan was revived in 1993's ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II]]'', this time portrayed entirely via a wire-manipulated marionette&lt;ref name="ryfle1998.2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan‚Äôs Favorite Mon-Star: The Unauthorized Biography of the Big G |last=Ryfle |first=S. |year=1998 |publisher=Toronto: ECW Press |isbn=1550223488 |pages=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hand puppets. Having received criticism for his emphasis on battle sequences relying heavily on beam weapons, special effects artist [[Koichi Kawakita]] sought to make the confrontation between Godzilla and Rodan as physical as possible.&lt;ref name="kalat199"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series|date=2010|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-47-49-7|pages=199|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MonsterVerse (2019-)===
In 2014, [[Legendary Pictures]] announced that they have acquired the rights to [[King Ghidorah]], [[Mothra]], and Rodan from [[Toho]] to use in their [[MonsterVerse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeffries |first=Adrianne |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/26/5940259/godzilla-2-confirmed-with-director-gareth-edwards |title=Gareth Edwards returns to direct 'Godzilla 2' with Rodan and Mothra |publisher=[[The Verge]] |date=July 26, 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodan appears in a [[Post-credits scene]] of ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]''. It is in the depicting cave paintings showing him, [[Mothra]], [[King Ghidorah]], and Godzilla in the footage that is shown to James Conrad and Mason Weaver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/kong-skull-island-after-credits-scene-explained/|title=‚ÄòKong: Skull Island‚Äô Post-Credits Scene Explained|last=Goldberg|first=Matt|work=Collider|date=March 11, 2017|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A casting call confirmed that Rodan, [[Mothra]], and [[King Ghidorah]] will be featured in ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/232097/three-kaiju-appear-confirmed-godzilla-king-monsters/|title=These Three Kaiju Appear to Be Confirmed for Godzilla: King of the Monsters|last=Barkan|first=Jonathan|work=Dread Central|date=May 31, 2017|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viral marketing describes him as a titanic bird with the skeletal structure of a ''Pteranodon'', with magma-like qualities serving as plate armor. The film's promotional website, Monarch Sciences, identifies the fictional island of Isla De Mona (not related to the real life [[Isla de Mona]] as the island is shown to be near Mexico) as Rodan's location and describes him as being {{convert|154|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} tall with a wingspan of {{convert|871|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}. It is also stated to be powerful enough to level cities with thunderclaps generated by its wings.&lt;ref&gt;https://screenrant.com/godzilla-2-monarch-site-every-secret/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.monarchsciences.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roar===
The character's shriek was created by sound technician Ichiro Minawa, who sought to replicate the "contrabass technique" composer [[Akira Ifukube]] used for Godzilla, though layering it with a sped up human voice.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Homenick, [http://www.akiraifukube.org/biography_part_nine.htm "Biography: Part IX - Myths, Monsters and Laments"], ''Akiraifukube.org'' (accessed May 30, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The sound would be remixed and reused for several other Toho monsters, including the second incarnation of [[King Ghidorah]]&lt;ref name="ryfle1998271"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan‚Äôs Favorite Mon-Star: The Unauthorized Biography of the Big G |last=Ryfle |first=S. |year=1998 |publisher=Toronto: ECW Press |isbn=1550223488 |pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Battra.&lt;ref name="kalat2010.roar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series|date=2010|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-47-49-7|pages=188|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rodrigo Neto''' (ca. 1975 ‚Äì 8 March 2013), a [[Brazil]]ian journalist for Radio Vanguardia and ''Vale do A√ßo'' newspaper in [[Ipatinga]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[Brazil]], was killed by two unidentified men who were suspected [[Human rights in Brazil#Torture|militia]] members.&lt;ref name=theguardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/apr/29/journalist-safety-brazil|title=Brazilian police arrested for journalists' murders|first=Roy|last=Greenslade|date=29 April 2013|publisher=The Guardian (UK)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Neto left behind a son, this is the only relative that mentioned. A mass in honor of Neto was held at the Santu√°rio de S√£o Judas Tadeu.&lt;ref name=hojeemdia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hojeemdia.com.br/horizontes/assassinato-do-jornalista-rodrigo-neto-completa-um-ano-1.246327|title=Assassinato do jornalista Rodrigo Neto completa um ano|publisher=hojeemdia.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
At the time of his death, Neto was working as a host of a local radio show "Plant de Pol√≠cia" (Translated: Police Shift) on the station Radio Vanguardia in Ipatinga. The week before his death he had begun working as a reporter for the daily ''Vale do A√ßo''. Neto also worked as a press aid for the mayor. A friend of Neto's, Fernando Benedito, says that Neto covered stories of [[police corruption]] throughout his career.&lt;ref name=ifex&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ifex.org/brazil/2013/03/12/journalist_shot_dead/|title=Journalist shot dead in Brazil, second in two weeks |publisher=IFEX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neto had recently covered stories that caused him to receive threats. It was mainly when he was covering a case where a police officer was a suspect of being involved in a murder, when he would receive these threats. According to Durval Angelo, a [[Member of Congress|congressman]] and president of the state assembly's [[Human rights commission]], told media sources that Neto was working on a book about the cases he had covered throughout his career at the time of his death and that the planned title was "The Perfect Crime".&lt;ref name=cpj /&gt;

}}Neto was murdered while leaving a community barbecue in Ipatinga, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Two unidentified men on motorcycles shot Neto as he was getting into his car in front of the Churrasquinho do Baiano, a local food stand. Three shots were fired at Neto and he took one to the head and the others to his torso. He was rushed to the hospital where he later died.&lt;ref name="ifex" /&gt;&lt;ref name=hojeemdia2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hojeemdia.com.br/horizontes/pol%C3%ADcia-anuncia-que-chegou-ao-autor-da-morte-do-jornalista-rodrigo-neto-1.160475|title=Pol√≠cia anuncia que chegou ao autor da morte do jornalista Rodrigo Neto|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation===
Investigators arrested five suspects, who were police officers.&lt;ref name=theguardian /&gt; These officers were suspected [[militia]] group members, who were operating in that area at the time of Neto's death. One of the arrested, was an investigator.&lt;ref name=diariopopularmg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diariopopularmg.com.br/vis_noticia.aspx?id=13432|title=Pol√≠cia Civil pede encerramento do caso Rodrigo Neto|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; L√∫cio L√≠rio Leal, an investigator of the Civil Police, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for qualified homicide.&lt;ref name=globo2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/mg/vales-mg/noticia/2015/08/acusado-de-matar-fotografo-em-fabriciano-e-condenado-14-anos.html|title=Acusado de matar fot√≥grafo em Fabriciano √© condenado a 14 anos|date=August 19, 2015|publisher=Globo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucia L√≠rio Leal, a former police officer, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for helping plan Neto's murder, in August 2014. Alessandra Neves Augusto, Pitote, was sentenced to 16 years in prison for carrying out the actions that killed Neto. Augusto decided the charges and says that he was framed by the local police. He was also charged with the murder of Carvalho.&lt;ref name=cpj&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpj.org/killed/2013/rodrigo-neto.php|title=Rodrigo Neto ‚Äì Journalists Killed |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|date=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time of Neto's death a [[Photojournalism|photojournalist]] was killed also. Walgney Carvalho was killed on April 14.&lt;ref name=cpj /&gt; Walgney Assis Carvalho  was killed by Alessandro Neves Augusto because Caravlho had told several people he knew who was responsible for Neto's death. Augusto was falsely passing for a police officer at the time.&lt;ref name=knightcenter1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-16259-man-sentenced-almost-30-years-2013-murders-brazilian-journalists|title=Man sentenced to almost 30 years for 2013 murders of two Brazilian journalists|publisher=Knight Center: Journalism in the Americas|date=August 24, 2015|first=Teresa |last=Mioli}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no mention of what the verdict was for the other men arreseted.

==Context==
Neto's colleagues came together to raise awareness of the crime committed onto Neto. They wore black bands on their wrists put on shirts with his name on them, and protested in demand of justice for Neto. A week after the protest, a photojournalist, who may have had knowledge of the crime, was murdered.&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/committee-to-protect-journalists/brazilian-journalists-fig_b_3194189.html|title=Brazilian journalists fight impunity, wage battle for press freedom |first1=Sara |last1=Rafsky |first2= |last2=CPJ.org|date=May 2, 2013|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The Committee to Protect Journalists wants the murder of a journalist to be classified as a federal crime, that way cases will be investigated by federal offices, which are better equipped and prepared.&lt;ref name=mediashift&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediashift.org/2016/03/amid-violence-in-brazil-convictions-in-journalists-murders-are-cause-for-optimism/|title=Amid Violence in Brazil, Convictions in Journalists' Murders are Cause for Optimism |date=March 9, 2016|publisher=mediashift.org|first=Andrew |last=Downie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
When there was no progress in his case for a month, around 1000 demonstrators rallied at the scene of his murder.&lt;ref name=hojeemdia2 /&gt;

[[Irina Bokova]], director-general of [[UNESCO]], said, "I call on the authorities to investigate this crime and bring those responsible to justice. This is an essential step to reinforce public confidence that attacks on journalists will not be tolerated."&lt;ref name= unesco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/director_general_urges_investigation_into_murder_of_brazilian_reporter_rodrigo_neto_de_faria/#.V-MdS_ArJaQ|title=Director-General urges investigation into murder of Brazilian Reporter Rodrigo Neto de Faria|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|date=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office of the Special Rapporteur requested that authorities conduct a prompt and diligent investigation to establish the motive of the crime, identify and appropriately punish the perpetrators.&lt;ref name=oas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/expression/showarticle.asp?artID=918&amp;lID=1|title=Office of the Special Rapporteur Condemns Murder of Journalist in Brazil|publisher=Inter-American Commission on Human Rights Organization of American States |date=March 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

L√∫cio L√≠rio Leal said, "I said that even if I was imprisoned for 200 years, I could say the name of who killed Rodrigo Neto, because I did not know who that person was." &lt;ref name=globo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/mg/vales-mg/noticia/2014/08/ex-policial-e-condenado-pela-morte-do-jornalista-rodrigo-neto.html|title=Ex-policial √© condenado pela morte do jornalista Rodrigo Neto|date=28 August 2014|publisher=Globo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Jos√© Braga said, "Impunity is a problem, and even though some have never been resolved, we are seeing advances,I think pressure from other journalists and journalism associations is also important and has made authorities more aware."&lt;ref name="mediashift" /&gt;

'''Search-based software engineering''' ('''SBSE''') applies [[metaheuristic]] search techniques such as [[genetic algorithms]], [[simulated annealing]] and [[tabu search]] to [[software engineering]] problems. Many activities in [[software engineering]] can be stated as [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems. [[Optimization (mathematics)|Optimization]] techniques of [[operations research]] such as [[linear programming]] or [[dynamic programming]] are often impractical for large scale [[software engineering]] problems because of their [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]]. Researchers and practitioners use [[metaheuristic]] search techniques to find near-optimal or "good-enough" solutions.

SBSE problems can be divided into two types:

* black-box optimization problems, for example, assigning people to tasks (a typical [[combinatorial optimization]] problem).
* white-box problems where operations on source code need to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;

==Definition==
SBSE converts a software engineering problem into a computational search problem that can be tackled with a [[metaheuristic]]. This involves defining a search space, or the set of possible solutions. This space is typically too large to be explored exhaustively, suggesting a [[metaheuristic]] approach. A metric &lt;ref&gt;

The term "[[search-based application]]", in contrast, refers to using [[search engine technology]], rather than search techniques, in another industrial application.

==Brief history==
One of the earliest attempts to apply [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] to a [[software engineering]] problem was reported by [[Webb Miller]] and David Spooner in 1976 in the area of [[software testing]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Requirements engineering===
[[Requirements engineering]] is the process by which the needs of a software's users and environment are determined and managed. Search-based methods have been used for requirements selection and optimisation with the goal of finding the best possible subset of requirements that matches user requests amid constraints such as limited resources and interdependencies between requirements. This problem is often tackled as a [[MCDM|multiple-criteria decision-making]] problem and, generally involves presenting the decision maker with a set of good compromises between cost and user satisfaction as well as the requirements risk.&lt;ref&gt;

===Debugging and maintenance===
Identifying a [[software bug]] (or a [[code smell]]) and then [[debugging]] (or [[refactoring]]) the software is largely a manual and labor-intensive endeavor, though the process is tool-supported. One objective of SBSE is to automatically identify and fix bugs (for example via [[mutation testing]]).

[[Genetic programming]], a biologically-inspired technique that involves evolving programs through the use of crossover and mutation, has been used to search for repairs to programs by altering a few lines of source code. The [http://dijkstra.cs.virginia.edu/genprog/ GenProg Evolutionary Program Repair] software repaired 55 out of 105 bugs for approximately $8 each in one test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

===Testing===
Search-based software engineering has been applied to software testing, including automatic generation of test cases (test data), test case minimization and test case prioritization. [[Regression testing]] has also received some attention.

===Optimizing software===
The use of SBSE in [[program optimization]], or modifying a piece of software to make it more efficient in terms of speed and resource use, has been the object of successful research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Memeti |first1=Suejb |last2=Pllana |first2=Sabri |last3=Binotto |first3=Alecio |last4=Kolodziej |first4=Joanna |last5=Brandic |first5=Ivona |title=Using meta-heuristics and machine learning for software optimization of parallel computing systems: a systematic literature review |journal=Computing |date=2018 |pages=1-44 |doi=10.1007/s00607-018-0614-9 |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00607-018-0614-9 |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, a 50,000 line program was genetically improved, resulting in a program 70 times faster on average.&lt;ref&gt;

===Project management===
A number of decisions that are normally made by a project manager can be done automatically, for example, project scheduling.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and techniques==
A number of methods and techniques are available, including:
* [[profiling (computer programming)|Profiling]]&lt;ref&gt;http://java-source.net/open-source/profilers&lt;/ref&gt; via [[instrumentation]] in order to monitor certain parts of a program as it is executed.
* Obtaining an [[abstract syntax tree]] associated with the program, which can be automatically examined to gain insights into its structure.
* Applications of [[program slicing]] relevant to SBSE include [[software maintenance]], [[Optimization (computer science)|optimization]] and [[Program analysis (computer science)|program analysis]].
* [[Code coverage]] allows measuring how much of the code is executed with a given set of input data.
* [[Static program analysis]]

==Industry acceptance==
As a relatively new area of research, SBSE does not yet experience broad industry acceptance. Software engineers are reluctant to adopt tools over which they have little control or that generate solutions that are unlike those that humans produce.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of SBSE use in fixing or improving programs, developers need to be confident that any automatically produced modification does not generate unexpected behavior outside the scope of a system's requirements and testing environment. Considering that fully automated programming has yet to be achieved, a desirable property of such modifications would be that they need to be easily understood by humans to support maintenance activities.&lt;ref&gt;

Another concern is that SBSE might make the software engineer redundant. Supporters claim that the motivation for SBSE is to enhance the relationship between the engineer and the program.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Thermoreg}}

'''Thermoregulation''' is the ability of an [[organism]] to keep its [[core temperature|body temperature]] within certain boundaries, even when the surrounding temperature is very different. A thermoconforming organism, by contrast, simply adopts the surrounding temperature as its own body temperature, thus avoiding the need for internal thermoregulation. The internal thermoregulation process is one aspect of [[homeostasis]]: a state of dynamic stability in an organism's internal conditions, maintained far from [[thermal equilibrium]] with its environment (the study of such processes in [[zoology]] has been called [[physiological ecology]]). If the body is unable to maintain a [[normal human body temperature|normal temperature]] and it increases significantly above normal, a condition known as [[hyperthermia]] occurs. For humans, this occurs when the body is exposed to constant temperatures of approximately {{convert|55|¬∞C|¬∞F}}, and with prolonged exposure (longer than a few hours) at this temperature and up to around {{convert|75|¬∞C|¬∞F}} death is almost inevitable.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the [[wet bulb temperature]] is sustained above {{convert|35|¬∞C|¬∞F}} for six hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100504155413.htm|title=  Global Warming: Future Temperatures Could Exceed Livable Limits, Researchers Find}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite condition, when body temperature decreases below normal levels, is known as [[hypothermia]]. It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction, causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it. Normal body temperature is around  {{convert|37|¬∞C|¬∞F}}, and hypothermia sets in when the core body temperature gets lower than {{convert|35|¬∞C|¬∞F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothermia/basics/definition/con-20020453|title=Hypothermia |work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures, hypothermia is usually treated by methods that attempt to raise the body temperature back to a normal range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-hypothermia#1|title=Hypothermia: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the introduction of [[thermometer]]s that any exact data on the temperature of animals could be obtained. It was then found that local differences were present, since heat production and heat loss vary considerably in different parts of the body, although the circulation of the blood tends to bring about a mean temperature of the internal parts. Hence it is important to identify the parts of the body that most closely reflect the temperature of the [[internal organ]]s. Also, for such results to be comparable, the measurements must be conducted under comparable conditions. The [[rectum]] has traditionally been considered to reflect most accurately the temperature of internal parts, or in some cases of sex or species, the [[vagina]], [[uterus]] or [[Urinary bladder|bladder]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=48}}

Occasionally the temperature of the [[urine]] as it leaves the [[urethra]] may be of use in measuring [[core temperature|body temperature]]. More often the temperature is taken in the [[mouth]], [[axilla]], [[ear]] or [[groin]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=49}}

Some animals undergo one of various forms of [[dormancy]] where the thermoregulation process temporarily allows the body temperature to drop, thereby conserving energy. Examples include [[Hibernation|hibernating]] [[bear]]s and [[torpor]] in [[bat]]s.

===Endothermy vs. ectothermy===
Thermoregulation in organisms runs along a spectrum from [[endotherm]]y to [[ectotherm]]y. [[Endotherm]]s create most of their heat via metabolic processes, and are colloquially referred to as [[Warm-Blooded|warm-blooded]]. When the surrounding temperatures are cold, endotherms increase metabolic heat production to keep their body temperature constant, thus making the internal body temperature of an endotherm more or less independent of the temperature of the environment.&lt;ref name="Khan Academy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/principles-of-physiology/metabolism-and-thermoregulation/a/endotherms-ectotherms|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One metabolic activity, in terms of generating heat, that endotherms are able to do is that they possess a larger number of mitochondria per cell than ectotherms, enabling them to generate more heat by increasing the rate at which they metabolize fats and sugars.&lt;ref name="Boundless"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boundless|date=2016-09-20|title=Homeostasis: Thermoregulation|url=https://www.boundless.com/biology/textbooks/boundless-biology-textbook/the-animal-body-basic-form-and-function-33/homeostasis-194/homeostasis-thermoregulation-743-11974/|journal=Boundless|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ectotherm]]s use external sources of temperature to regulate their body temperatures. They are colloquially referred to as [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]] despite the fact that body temperatures often stay within the same temperature ranges as warm-blooded animals. Ectotherms are the opposite of endotherms when it comes to regulating internal temperatures. In ectotherms, the internal physiological sources of heat are of negligible importance; the biggest factor that enables them to maintain adequate body temperatures is due to environmental influences. Living in areas that maintain a constant temperature throughout the year, like the tropics or the ocean, have enabled ectotherms to develop a wide range of behavioral mechanisms that enable them to respond to external temperatures, such as sun-bathing to increase body temperature, or seeking the cover of shade to lower body temperature.&lt;ref name="Boundless"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khan Academy"/&gt;

===Ectotherms===

===Ectothermic cooling===
*Vaporization:
** [[Evaporation]] of sweat and other bodily fluids.
*Convection:
**Increasing blood flow to body surfaces to maximize heat transfer across the advective gradient.
*Conduction:
**Losing heat by being in contact with a colder surface. For instance:
***Lying on cool ground.
***Staying wet in a river, lake or sea.
***Covering in cool mud.
**
*Radiation:
**releasing heat by radiating it away from the body.

===Ectothermic heating (or minimizing heat loss)===
*Convection:
**Climbing to higher ground up trees, ridges, rocks.
**Entering a warm water or air current.
**Building an insulated nest or burrow.

To cope with low temperatures, some [[fish]] have developed the ability to remain functional even when the water temperature is below freezing; some use natural [[antifreeze]] or [[antifreeze proteins]] to resist ice crystal formation in their tissues. [[Amphibian]]s and [[reptile]]s cope with heat loss by evaporative cooling and behavioral adaptations. An example of behavioral adaptation is that of a lizard lying in the sun on a hot rock in order to heat through conduction.

===Endothermy===

{{Main|Endotherm}}

An endotherm is an animal that regulates its own body temperature, typically by keeping it at a constant level. To regulate body temperature, an organism may need to prevent heat gains in arid environments. Evaporation of water, either across respiratory surfaces or across the skin in those animals possessing [[sweat glands]], helps in cooling body temperature to within the organism's tolerance range. Animals with a body covered by fur have limited ability to sweat, relying heavily on '''panting''' to increase evaporation of water across the moist surfaces of the lungs and the tongue and mouth. Mammals like cats, dogs and pigs, rely on panting or other means for thermal regulation and have sweat glands only in foot pads and snout. The sweat produced on pads of paws and on palms and soles mostly serves to increase friction and enhance grip. [[Bird]]s also counteract overheating by '''gular fluttering''', or rapid vibrations of the [[Gular skin|gular (throat) skin]]. [[Down feathers]] trap warm air acting as excellent insulators just as hair in mammals acts as a good insulator. Mammalian skin is much thicker than that of birds and often has a continuous layer of insulating fat beneath the dermis. In marine mammals, such as whales, or animals that live in very cold regions, such as the polar bears, this is called [[blubber]]. Dense coats found in desert endotherms also aid in preventing heat gain such as in the case of the camels.

A cold weather strategy is to temporarily decrease metabolic rate, decreasing the temperature difference between the animal and the air and thereby minimizing heat loss. Furthermore, having a lower metabolic rate is less energetically expensive. Many animals survive cold frosty nights through [[torpor]], a short-term temporary drop in body temperature. Organisms when presented with the problem of regulating body temperature have not only behavioural, physiological, and structural adaptations but also a feedback system to trigger these adaptations to regulate temperature accordingly. The main features of this system are ''stimulus, receptor, modulator, effector'' and then the feedback of the newly adjusted temperature to the ''stimulus.'' This cyclical process aids in homeostasis.

===Homeothermy compared with poikilothermy===
[[Homeothermy]] and [[poikilothermy]] refer to how stable an organism's deep-body temperature is. Most endothermic organisms are homeothermic, like [[mammal]]s. However, animals with [[facultative endothermy]] are often poikilothermic, meaning their temperature can vary considerably. Most [[fish]] are ectotherms, as most of their heat comes from the surrounding water. However, almost all fish are poikilothermic.

==Vertebrates==
By numerous observations upon [[homo sapiens sapiens|humans]] and other animals, [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] showed that the essential difference between the so-called [[warm-blooded]] and [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] animals lies in observed constancy of the temperature of the former, and the observed variability of the temperature of the latter. Almost all birds and mammals have a high temperature almost constant and independent of that of the surrounding air ([[Homeothermic|homeothermy]]). Almost all other animals display a variation of body temperature, dependent on their surroundings ([[Poikilothermic|poikilothermy]]).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=49}}

===Brain control===
Thermoregulation in both ectotherms and endotherms is controlled mainly by the [[preoptic area]] of the [[anterior hypothalamus]].&lt;ref name="Romanovsky"/&gt; Such [[homeostatic]] control is separate from the [[Sense#Temperature|sensation of temperature]].&lt;ref name="Romanovsky"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Romanovsky | first1 = AA | year = 2007 | title = Functional architecture of the thermoregulatory system | url = http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/292/1/R37| journal = Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol | volume = 292 | issue = 1| pages = R37‚Äì46 | doi = 10.1152/ajpregu.00668.2006 | pmid = 17008453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In birds and mammals===
[[File:Kangaroo licking itself to cool.jpg|thumb|250px|Kangaroo [[licking]] its arms to cool down on a very hot day]]
In cold environments, birds and mammals employ the following adaptations and strategies to minimize heat loss:
# Using small smooth muscles (arrector pili in mammals), which are attached to feather or hair shafts; this distorts the surface of the skin making feather/hair shaft stand erect (called [[goose bumps]] or pimples) which slows the movement of air across the skin and minimizes heat loss.
# Increasing body size to more easily maintain core body temperature (warm-blooded animals in cold climates tend to be larger than similar species in warmer climates (see [[Bergmann's Rule]]))
# Having the ability to store energy as fat for [[metabolism]]
# Have shortened extremities
# Have [[countercurrent exchange|countercurrent blood flow]] in extremities ‚Äì this is where the warm arterial blood travelling to the limb passes the cooler venous blood from the limb and heat is exchanged warming the venous blood and cooling the arterial (e.g., [[Arctic wolf]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Swan | first = K.

In warm environments, birds and mammals employ the following adaptations and strategies to maximize heat loss:
# Behavioural adaptations like living in burrows during the day and being nocturnal
# Evaporative cooling by perspiration and panting
# Storing fat reserves in one place (e.g., camel's hump) to avoid its insulating effect
# Elongated, often vascularized extremities to conduct body heat to the air

As in other mammals, thermoregulation is an important aspect of [[human homeostasis]]. Most body heat is generated in the deep organs, especially the liver, brain, and heart, and in contraction of skeletal muscles.&lt;ref name="GuytonHall2006p80"&gt;{{cite book |year=2006 |author=Guyton, A.C., &amp; Hall, J.E. |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |edition=11th |place=Philadelphia |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |page=890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have been able to adapt to a great diversity of climates, including hot humid and hot arid. High temperatures pose serious stresses for the human body, placing it in great danger of injury or even death. For example, one of the most common reactions to hot temperatures is heat exhaustion, which is an illness that could happen if one is exposed to high temperatures, resulting in some symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, or a rapid heartbeat.&lt;ref&gt;"Heat Exhaustion: Symptoms and Treatment".

There are three avenues of heat loss: convection, conduction, and radiation. If skin temperature is greater than that of the surroundings, the body can lose heat by radiation and conduction. But, if the temperature of the surroundings is greater than that of the skin, the body actually ''gains'' heat by radiation and conduction. In such conditions, the only means by which the body can rid itself of heat is by evaporation. So, when the surrounding temperature is higher than the skin temperature, anything that prevents adequate evaporation will cause the internal body temperature to rise.&lt;ref name=GuytonHall2006pp891892&gt;Guyton &amp; Hall (2006), pp. 891‚Äì892&lt;/ref&gt; During intense physical activity (e.g. sports), evaporation becomes the main avenue of heat loss.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmore, Jack H., &amp; Costill, David L.

[[Thermogenesis]] occurs in the flowers of many plants in the [[Araceae]] family as well as in [[cycad]] cones.&lt;ref name=Minorsky&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/132/1/25 |title=The Hot and the Classic |journal=Plant Physiol |date = May 2003|volume=132 |pages=25‚Äì26 |first=Peter V. |last=Minorsky |doi=10.1104/pp.900071 |pmid=12765187 |issue=1 |pmc=1540311}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Nelumbo nucifera|sacred lotus]] (''Nelumbo nucifera'') is able to thermoregulate itself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.me.berkeley.edu/ME212/lec6/i_Plants_Thermoregulation.pdf

One possible explanation for plant thermoregulation is to provide protection against cold temperature. For example, the skunk cabbage is not frost-resistant, yet it begins to grow and flower when there is still snow on the ground.&lt;ref name=Minorsky /&gt; Another theory is that thermogenicity helps attract pollinators, which is borne out by observations that heat production is accompanied by the arrival of beetles or flies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Thermogenesis in three Philodendron species (Araceae) of French Guiana |first=Marc |last=Gibernau |first2=Denis |last2=Barab√© |year=2000 |journal=Canadian Journal of Botany |url=http://www.edb.ups-tlse.fr/equipe3/MG/publis/thermo.pdf |doi=10.1139/cjb-78-5-685 |volume=78 |issue=5 |pages=685 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavioral temperature regulation==
Animals other than humans regulate and maintain their body temperature with physiological adjustments and behavior. Desert lizards are ectotherms and so unable to metabolically control their temperature but can do this by altering their location. They may do this, in the morning only by raising their head from its burrow and then exposing their entire body. By basking in the sun, the lizard absorbs solar heat. It may also absorb heat by conduction from heated rocks that have stored radiant solar energy. To lower their temperature, lizards exhibit varied behaviors. Sand seas, or [[erg (landform)|erg]]s, produce up to {{convert|57.7|¬∞C|¬∞F}}, and the sand lizard will hold its feet up in the air to cool down, seek cooler objects with which to contact, find shade or return to their burrow. They also go to their burrows to avoid cooling when the sun goes down or the temperature falls.  Aquatic animals can also regulate their temperature behaviorally by changing their position in the thermal gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westhoff|first=Jacob|date=9 Oct 2014|title=Behavioural thermoregulation and bioenergetics of riverine smallmouth bass associated with ambient cold-period thermal refuge|journal=Ecology of Freshwater Fish|doi=10.1111/eff.12192|pmid=|volume=25|pages=72‚Äì85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:smallhuddle.jpg|thumb|During cold weather many animals increase their thermal inertia by huddling.]]

Some animals living in cold environments maintain their body temperature by preventing heat loss. Their fur grows more densely to increase the amount of [[Thermal insulation|insulation]]. Some animals are [[heterothermic|regionally heterothermic]] and are able to allow their less insulated extremities to cool to temperatures much lower than their core temperature‚Äînearly to {{convert|0|¬∞C|¬∞F}}. This minimizes heat loss through less insulated body parts, like the legs, feet (or hooves), and nose.

===Hibernation, estivation and daily torpor===
To cope with limited food resources and low temperatures, some mammals [[hibernation|hibernate]] during cold periods. To remain in "stasis" for long periods, these animals build up [[Brown adipose tissue|brown fat]] reserves and slow all body functions. True hibernators (e.g., groundhogs) keep their body temperatures low throughout hibernation whereas the [[core temperature]] of false hibernators (e.g., bears) varies; occasionally the animal may emerge from its den for brief periods. Some bats are true hibernators and rely upon a rapid, non-shivering thermogenesis of their brown fat deposit to bring them out of hibernation.

[[Aestivation|Estivation]] is similar to hibernation, however, it usually occurs in hot periods to allow animals to avoid high temperatures and [[desiccation]].  Both terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate and vertebrates enter into estivation. Examples include lady beetles (''[[Coccinellidae]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kenneth S. Hagen |year=1962 |title=Biology and ecology of predaceous Coccinellidae |journal=[[Annual Review of Entomology]] |volume=7 |pages=289‚Äì326 |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.07.010162.001445}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Desert tortoise|North American desert tortoises]], [[crocodile]]s, [[salamander]]s, [[cane toad]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.audubonguides.com/article.html?id=27 |publisher=[[Audubon Guides]] |title=Estivation: The Survial{{sic|hide=n}} Siesta |date=29 September 2009 |author=Bob Moore |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cyclorana platycephala|water-holding frog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=F.H.

Daily [[torpor]] occurs in small endotherms like [[bats]] and [[hummingbirds]], which temporarily reduces their high metabolic rates to conserve energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology: Concepts and Applications |first=Cecie |last=Starr |year=2005 |publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |pages=639 | isbn=978-0-534-46226-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RtSpGV_Pl_0C&amp;pg=PA639&amp;dq=cold+temperatures+birds+minimize+heat+loss

== Variation in animals ==
[[File:Body Temp Variation.png|thumb|250px|Chart showing diurnal variation in body temperature.]]

===Normal human temperature===
{{Main|Normal human body temperature}}
Previously, average oral temperature for healthy adults had been considered {{convert|37.0|¬∞C|¬∞F|abbr=on}}, while normal ranges are {{convert|36.1|¬∞C|¬∞F|abbr=on}} to {{convert|37.8|¬∞C|¬∞F|abbr=on}}. In Poland and Russia, the temperature had been measured [[axilla]]ry. 36.6&amp;nbsp;¬∞C was considered "ideal" temperature in these countries, while normal ranges are 36&amp;nbsp;¬∞C to 36.9&amp;nbsp;¬∞C.

Recent studies suggest that the average temperature for healthy adults is {{convert|36.8|C|abbr=on}} (same result in three different studies). Variations (one [[standard deviation]]) from three other studies are:
* 36.4‚Äì37.1&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (97.5‚Äì98.8&amp;nbsp;¬∞F)
* 36.3‚Äì37.1&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (97.3‚Äì98.8&amp;nbsp;¬∞F) for males, 36.5‚Äì37.3&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (97.7‚Äì99.1&amp;nbsp;¬∞F) for females
* 36.6‚Äì37.3&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (97.9‚Äì99.1&amp;nbsp;¬∞F)&lt;ref name=factbook&gt;{{cite journal |title=Temperature of a Healthy Human (Body Temperature) |last=Wong |first=Lena |url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/LenaWong.shtml |year=2005 |doi=10.1046/j.1471-6712.2002.00069.x |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences, the Physics Factbook |volume=16 |pages=122‚Äì128 |pmid=12000664 |last2=Forsberg |first2=C |last3=Wahren |first3=LK |issue=2 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=24 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926162224/http://hypertextbook.com/facts/LenaWong.shtml |archivedate=26 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measured temperature varies according to thermometer placement, with rectal temperature being 0.3‚Äì0.6&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (0.5‚Äì1&amp;nbsp;¬∞F) higher than oral temperature, while axillary temperature is 0.3‚Äì0.6&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (0.5‚Äì1&amp;nbsp;¬∞F) lower than oral temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://health.yahoo.com/topic/hearing/resources/article/healthwise/tw9223 |title=Rectal, ear, oral, and axillary temperature comparison |publisher=Yahoo Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average difference between oral and axillary temperatures of [[India]]n children aged 6‚Äì12 was found to be only 0.1&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (standard deviation 0.2&amp;nbsp;¬∞C),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.indianpediatrics.net/june2004/600.pdf |title=Comparison of Axillary Temperature with Rectal or Oral Temperature and Determination of Optimum Placement Time in Children |journal=Indian Pediatrics |volume=41  |date=17 June 2004 |pages=600‚Äì603 |author1=Deepti Chaturvedi |author2=K.Y.

Bharambe |pmid=15235167 |issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mean difference in [[Malta|Maltese]] children aged 4‚Äì14 between oral and axillary temperature was 0.56&amp;nbsp;¬∞C, while the mean difference between rectal and axillary temperature for children under 4 years old was 0.38&amp;nbsp;¬∞C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.annemergmed.com/article/PIIS0196064404002318/fulltext |title=How reliable is axillary temperature measurement? |first=E.C. |last=Quintana |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=797‚Äì798 |date = June 2004|doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2004.03.010 |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variations due to circadian rhythms===
In humans, a diurnal variation has been observed dependent on the periods of rest and activity, lowest at 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. and peaking at 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. [[Monkey]]s also have a well-marked and regular diurnal variation of body temperature that follows periods of rest and activity, and is not dependent on the incidence of day and night; [[nocturnal]] monkeys reach their highest body temperature at night and lowest during the day. Sutherland Simpson and J.J. Galbraith observed that all nocturnal animals and birds ‚Äì whose periods of rest and activity are naturally reversed through habit and not from outside interference ‚Äì experience their highest temperature during the natural period of activity (night) and lowest during the period of rest (day).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=49}} Those diurnal temperatures can be reversed by reversing their daily routine.&lt;ref name=Simpson&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc = 1465744|year = 1905|last1 = Simpson|first1 = S|title = An investigation into the diurnal variation of the body temperature of nocturnal and other birds, and a few mammals|journal = The Journal of Physiology|volume = 33|issue = 3|pages = 225‚Äì238|last2 = Galbraith|first2 = J. J|pmid = 16992810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, the temperature curve of [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds is similar to that of man and other homoeothermal animals, except that the maximum occurs earlier in the afternoon and the minimum earlier in the morning. Also, the curves obtained from rabbits, [[guinea pig]]s, and dogs were quite similar to those from man.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=49}} These observations indicate that body temperature is partially regulated by [[circadian rhythm]]s.

===Variations due to women's menstrual cycles===
During the [[follicular phase]] (which lasts from the first day of [[menstruation]] until the day of [[ovulation]]), the average [[basal body temperature]] in women ranges from 36.45 to 36.7&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (97.6 to 98.1&amp;nbsp;¬∞F). Within 24 hours of ovulation, women experience an elevation of 0.15‚Äì0.45&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (0.2‚Äì0.9&amp;nbsp;¬∞F) due to the increased metabolic rate caused by sharply elevated levels of [[progesterone]]. The basal body temperature ranges between 36.7‚Äì37.3&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (98.1‚Äì99.2&amp;nbsp;¬∞F) throughout the [[luteal phase]], and drops down to pre-ovulatory levels within a few days of menstruation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JZb0ibgYDCIC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=temperature+higher+during+follicular+phase |title=Women's Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation |isbn=978-0-8342-1731-7 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |year=2001 |last= Swedan |first=Nadya Gabriele |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women can chart this phenomenon to determine whether and when they are ovulating, so as to aid conception or contraception.

===Variations due to fever===
[[Fever]] is a regulated elevation of the set point of core temperature in the [[hypothalamus]], caused by circulating pyrogens produced by the immune system. To the subject, a rise in core temperature due to fever may result in feeling cold in an environment where people without fever do not.

===Variations due to biofeedback===
Some monks are known to practice [[Tummo]], [[biofeedback]] [[meditation]] techniques, that allow them to raise their body temperatures substantially.&lt;ref name=harvardgazette&gt;{{cite book |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/04.18/09-tummo.html |title=Meditation changes temperatures: Mind controls body in extreme experiments |first=William J. |last=Cromie |publisher=Harvard Gazette |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Low body temperature increases lifespan ==
It has been theorised that low body temperature may increase lifespan. In 2006, it was reported that transgenic mice with a body temperature 0.3‚Äì0.5 C lower than normal mice lived longer than normal mice.  This mechanism is due to overexpressing the uncoupling protein 2 in [[hypocretin]] neurons (Hcrt-UCP2), which elevated hypothalamic temperature, thus forcing the [[hypothalamus]] to lower body temperature.  Lifespan was increased by 12% and 20% for males and females, respectively.  The mice were fed ''[[ad libitum]]''.&lt;ref name=sciencemag&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/314/5800/825 Transgenic Mice with a Reduced Core Body Temperature Have an Increased Life Span], by Bruno Conti et al. ''Science'', 3, November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sciencedaily&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061103083756.htm Reduced Body Temperature Extends Lifespan, Study Finds]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://balancinglife.blogspot.com/2006/11/be-cool-live-long.html Bee cool, live long]&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of such a genetic change in body temperature on longevity is more difficult to study in humans; in 2011, the UCP2 genetic alleles in humans were associated with obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/601693|title=OMIM entry on human UnCoupling Protein 2 (UCP2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limits compatible with life ==
There are limits both of heat and cold that an endothermic animal can bear and other far wider limits that an [[ectothermic]] animal may endure and yet live. The effect of too extreme a cold is to decrease [[metabolism]], and hence to lessen the production of heat. Both [[catabolic]] and [[Anabolism|anabolic]] pathways share in this metabolic depression, and, though less energy is used up, still less energy is generated. The effects of this diminished metabolism become telling on the [[central nervous system]] first, especially the [[brain]] and those parts concerning consciousness;&lt;ref name=cat&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J. Physiol. |date=1905-05-09 |volume=32|issue=5 Suppl 8|pages=305‚Äì11| title=The effect of cold narcosis on reflex action in warm-blooded animals|vauthors=Simpson S, Herring PT | pmid=16992777|postscript=.| pmc=1465681 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1905.sp001084}}&lt;/ref&gt; both [[heart rate]] and [[respiration rate]] decrease; judgment becomes impaired as drowsiness supervenes, becoming steadily deeper until the individual loses consciousness; without medical intervention, [[death]] by [[hypothermia]] quickly follows. Occasionally, however, [[convulsion]]s may set in towards the end, and death is caused by [[asphyxia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=50}}&lt;ref name=cat /&gt;

In experiments on cats performed by Sutherland Simpson and Percy T. Herring, the animals were unable to survive when rectal temperature fell below 16&amp;nbsp;¬∞C.&lt;ref name=cat /&gt; At this low temperature, respiration became increasingly feeble; heart-impulse usually continued after respiration had ceased, the beats becoming very irregular, appearing to cease, then beginning again. Death appeared to be mainly due to [[asphyxia]], and the only certain sign that it had taken place was the loss of knee-jerks.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=50}}

However, too high a temperature speeds up the metabolism of different tissues to such a rate that their metabolic capital is soon exhausted. Blood that is too warm produces [[dyspnea]] by exhausting the metabolic capital of the respiratory centre;{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} heart rate is increased; the beats then become arrhythmic and eventually cease. The central nervous system is also profoundly affected by [[hyperthermia]] and [[delirium]], and convulsions may set in. Consciousness may also be lost, propelling the person into a [[coma]]tose condition. These changes can sometimes also be observed in patients suffering from an acute [[fever]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} [[Mammal]]ian muscle becomes rigid with heat rigor at about 50&amp;nbsp;¬∞C, with the sudden rigidity of the whole body rendering life impossible.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=50}}

H.M. Vernon performed work on the death temperature and paralysis temperature (temperature of heat rigor) of various animals. He found that species of the same [[Class (biology)|class]] showed very similar temperature values, those from the [[Amphibia]] examined being 38.5&amp;nbsp;¬∞C, [[fish]] 39&amp;nbsp;¬∞C, [[Reptilia|reptiles]] 45&amp;nbsp;¬∞C, and various [[mollusc]]s 46&amp;nbsp;¬∞C.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Also, in the case of [[pelagic]] animals, he showed a relation between death temperature and the quantity of solid constituents of the body. In higher animals, however, his experiments tend to show that there is greater variation in both the chemical and physical characteristics of the [[protoplasm]] and, hence, greater variation in the extreme temperature compatible with life.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=50}}

===Arthropoda===
The maximum temperatures tolerated by certain [[thermophilic]] arthropods exceeds the lethal temperatures for most vertebrates.&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/04/140427191124.htm |title=Mite sets new record as world's fastest land animal |author=Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) |date=27 April 2014 |website=Featured Research |publisher=ScienceDaily |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most heat-resistant insects are three genera of desert ants recorded from three different parts of the world. The ants have developed a lifestyle of scavenging for short durations during the hottest hours of the day, in excess of {{convert|50|¬∞C|¬∞F}}, for the carcasses of insects and other forms of life which have succumbed to heat stress.&lt;ref name="InsectRecords"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_21.shtml |title=Chapter 21: Most heat tolerant |author=Sherwood, Van |date= 1 May 1996 |website=Book of Insect Records |publisher=University of Florida |accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the South Californian mite ''[[Paratarsotomus macropalpis]]'' has been recorded as the world's fastest land animal relative to body length, at a speed of 322 body lengths per second. Besides the unusually great speed of the mites, the researchers were surprised to find the mites running at such speeds on concrete at temperatures up to {{convert|60|¬∞C|¬∞F}}, which is significant because this temperature is well above the lethal limit for the majority of animal species. In addition, the mites are able to stop and change direction very quickly.&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"/&gt;

'''Victim mentality''' is an acquired [[personality]] [[trait theory|trait]] in which a person tends to recognize themselves as a victim of the negative actions of others, and to behave as if this were the case in the face of contrary evidence of such circumstances. Victim mentality depends on clear [[thought]] processes and [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]]. In most cases, those with a victim mentality have in fact been the victim of wrongdoing by others or have otherwise suffered misfortune through no fault of their own; however, such misfortune does not necessarily imply that one will respond by developing a ''pervasive and universal'' victim mentality where one frequently or constantly perceives oneself to be a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/counselling/victim-mentality.htm|title=The Victim Mentality ‚Äì What It Is &amp; Why You Use It|website=HarleyTherapy.co.uk (Harley Therapy Ltd.- Psychotherapy &amp; Counselling in London)|orig-year=2006|department=Counselling Blog|layurl=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/about-us.htm|date=April 26, 2016|accessdate=August 7, 2018|postscript= ‚Üí Constantly acting a victim can have perceived benefits: '''(1) Having the 'Right' to Complain (2) Less likely to Receive Criticism (3) More likely to be Granted Requests (4) Avoiding Anger, too Occupied w/ Feeling Sad'''. ‚Üí People with a victim mentality '''believe they have little other means of achieving Attention, Feelings of Value, &amp; Power'''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used in reference to the tendency for recognizing one's misfortunes on somebody else's misdeeds, which is also referred to as '''victimism'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvey|first1=Annelie J.|last2=Callan|first2= Mitchell J. |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4103766/|pmc=4103766|title=Getting "Just Deserts" or Seeing the "Silver Lining": The Relation between Judgments of Immanent and Ultimate Justice|date=July 18, 2014|department=Abstract|journal=[[PLOS ONE]] - beta version of PLOS (Public Library of Science) - Scientific Journal|volume=9|issue=7|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0101803 |accessdate=August 7, 2018|postscript= ‚Üí Observers engaged in more ultimate justice reasoning for a "good" victim &amp; '''greater immanent justice reasoning for a "bad" victim.'''

Victim mentality is primarily developed, for example, from family members and situations during childhood. Similarly, criminals often engage in victim thinking, believing themselves to be moral and engaging in crime only as a reaction to an immoral world and furthermore feeling that authorities are unfairly singling them out for persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bar-Tal|first1=Daniel|last2=Chernyak-Hai|first2=Lily|last3=Schori|first3=Noa|last4=Gundar|first4=Ayelet |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/irrc-874-bartal-chernyakhai-schori-gundar.pdf|format=PDF|title=A sense of self-perceived collective victimhood in intractable conflicts|date=June 2009|department=Sequential stages: the process of victimization; Victim-to-victimizer cycle|journal=[[International Review of the Red Cross]]|volume=91|number=874|pages=234; 256|doi=10.1017/S1816383109990221|accessdate=August 7, 2018|quote=those who '''perceive themselves as a victim attempt to gain social validation by persuading others (family, friends, authorities''', etc.) to recognize that the harm occurred &amp; that they are victims...the sense of '''collective victimhood is related to negative affective consequences of fear, reduced empathy &amp; anger, to cognitive biases such as interpretation of ambiguous information as hostile &amp; threatening, to emergence of the belief that violent action taken is morally justified, to reduced moral accountability &amp; finally to a tendency to seek revenge'''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Foundations ==
In the most general sense, a victim is anyone who experiences injury, loss, or misfortune as a result of some event or series of events.&lt;ref&gt;K. Aquino and K. Byron, 'Dominating interpersonal behavior and perceived victimization in groups: Evidence for a curvilinear relationship', Journal of Management, Vol. 28, No. 1, 2002, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; This negative experience, however, is insufficient for the emergence of a sense of victimhood. Individuals may identify as a victim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/counselling/victim-mentality.htm|title=The Victim Mentality ‚Äì What It Is &amp; Why You Use It|website=HarleyTherapy.co.uk (Harley Therapy Ltd.- Psychotherapy &amp; Counselling in London)|orig-year=2006|department=Counselling Blog|layurl=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/about-us.htm|date=April 26, 2016|accessdate=August 7, 2018|postscript= ‚Üí You might be the victim of a crime. In such a case you have every right to feel that things were out of your control, because they were, &amp; any thought that it‚Äôs somehow your fault &amp; you are responsible is erroneous thinking. '''A healthy person recognises that beyond random bad occurrences, many things in life happen because of choices they themselves made, &amp; that they have power to choose differently. They understand that when misfortune does happen, it is nothing to do with personal value or 'deserving' or 'not deserving''''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; if they believe that:
* they were harmed;
* they were not the cause of the occurrence of the harmful act;
* they were under no obligation to prevent the harm;
* the harm constituted an injustice in that it violated their rights (if inflicted by a person) and/or in that they possessed qualities (''e.g.'', strength or goodness of character) making them persons whom that harm did not befit;
* they deserve empathy.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Sykes, ''A nation of victims: The decay of the American character,'' St. Martin's Press: New York, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
The desire of empathy is crucial in that the mere experience of a harmful event is not enough for the emergence of the sense of being a victim. In order to have this sense, there is the need to perceive the harm as undeserved, unjust and immoral, an act that could not be prevented by the victim. The need to obtain empathy and understanding can then emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayIssue?jid=IRC&amp;volumeId=91&amp;seriesId=0&amp;issueId=874|title=International Review of the Red Cross: Volume 91 - War victims - Cambridge Core|website=Cambridge Core}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals harbouring a victim mentality would believe that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/counselling/victim-mentality.htm|title=The Victim Mentality ‚Äì What It Is &amp; Why You Use It|website=HarleyTherapy.co.uk (Harley Therapy Ltd.- Psychotherapy &amp; Counselling in London)|orig-year=2006|department=Counselling Blog|layurl=https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/about-us.htm|date=April 26, 2016|accessdate=August 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* their lives are a series of challenges directly aimed at them;
* most aspects of life are negative and beyond their control;
* the challenges in their lives merit them deserving of sympathy;
* as they have little power to change things, little action should be taken to improve their problems. 
In essence, victim mentality is a method of avoiding responsibility and criticism, receiving attention and compassion, and evading feelings of genuine [[anger]].

==Features==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2013}}
A victim mentality may manifest itself in a range of different behaviours or ways of thinking and talking:
* Identifying others as the cause for an undesired situation and denying an personal responsibility for one's own life or circumstances.&lt;ref name="Vries"/&gt;
* Exhibiting heightened attention levels ([[hypervigilance]]) when in the presence of others. 
* Awareness of negative intentions of other people.
* Believing that other people are generally more fortunate.
* Gaining relief from feeling empathy for oneself or receiving empathy from others.

In has been typically characterized by attitudes of [[pessimism]], [[self-pity]], and repressed anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drshirin.com/victimme.htm|title=The Victim Mentality|website=DrShirin.com|department=Articles|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327185951/http://www.drshirin.com:80/victimme.htm|archivedate=March 27, 2007|first=Dr. Kim K.|last=Shirin|accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with victim mentality may develop convincing and sophisticated explanations in support of such ideas, which they then use to explain to themselves and others of their situation.

People with victim mentality may also be generally:
* realist, with a general tendency to realistically perceive a situation; yet may lack an awareness and/or curiosity about the root of actual powerlessness in a situation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/inviting-monkey-tea/201801/are-you-ready-stop-feeling-victim|first=Nancy|last=Colier|title=Are You Ready to Stop Feeling Like a Victim?|magazine=Psychology Today|date=January 12, 2018|accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* introspective
* likely to display entitlement and selfishness.&lt;ref&gt;
Zitek, E. M., Jordan, A. H., Monin, B., &amp; Leach, F. R. (2010). Victim entitlement to behave selfishly. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 98(2), 245-255.
http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0017168&lt;/ref&gt;
* defensive: In conversation, reading a negative intention into a neutral question and reacting with a corresponding accusation, hindering the collective solution of problems by recognizing the inherent conflict.
* categorizing: tending to divide people into "good" and "bad" with no gray zone between them.&lt;ref name="Vries"&gt;de Vries M.F.R.K. (2014) Are You a Victim of the Victim Syndrome?. In: Mindful Leadership Coaching. INSEAD Business Press. Palgrave Macmillan, London&lt;/ref&gt;
* unadventurous: generally unwilling to take even small and calculated risks; exaggerating the importance or likelihood of possible negative outcomes.
* exhibiting [[learned helplessness]]: underestimating one's ability or influence in a given situation; feeling powerless.
* [[self-abasing]]: Putting oneself down even further than others are doing.

A victim mentality may be reflected by linguistic markers or habits, such as pretending
* not to be able to do something ("I can't..."),
* not to have choices ("I must...") ("I have no choice..."), or
* epistemological humilty ("I don't know").

==Victims of abuse and manipulation==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
Victims of [[abuse]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] often get trapped into a [[self-image]] of victimisation. The psychological profile of victimisation includes a pervasive sense of helplessness, passivity, loss of control, [[pessimism]], negative thinking, strong feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[Blame#Self-blame|self-blame]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. This way of thinking can lead to hopelessness and despair.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;Braiker, Harriet B., Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breaking out==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
Since victim mentality is primarily a reaction to one's experiences and not inborn, it is possible to change it which may be provoked by an extraordinary situation or crisis. Since recognizing naive and condescending suggestions is a general characteristic feature of victim mentality, a person with victim mentality will generally not respond positively to attempts by another person to wrongly identify the problem and its solution. For this reason, the condition may become chronic.

However, successful identified techniques have included therapeutic teaching methods regarding concepts of [[normative]] [[decision theory]], [[emotional intelligence]], [[cognitive therapy]], and psychological [[locus of control]]. These methods have proven helpful in allowing individuals with a victim mentality mindset to both recognize and release the mindset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danziger|first=Sanford|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/9766a32d3470e98b8b39bb8ea8fdfd4a/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=47765|title=The Educational Benefits of Releasing "Victim Mentality": An Approach from the Fields of Business and Psychology|date=2010|department=Developments|journal=Journal of Developmental Education|volume=34|issue=2|page=43|url-access=subscription|format=PDF|publisher=[[ProQuest]]|location=Boone, North Carolina|accessdate=August 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==

One may consider collective victimhood in political settings. If the leaders of a country, and the citizens who support them, collectively feel like victims of neighboring countries (e.g. following past border disputes), those leaders may be more likely to advocate violent conflict resolution or suppression of freedom of speech.

Political psychologists Bar-Tal and Chernyak-Hai write that collective victim mentality develops from a progression of self-realization, social recognition, and eventual attempts to maintain victimhood status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bar-Tal|first1=Daniel|last2=Chernyak-Hai|first2=Lily|last3=Schori|first3=Noa|last4=Gundar|first4=Ayelet |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/irrc-874-bartal-chernyakhai-schori-gundar.pdf|format=PDF|title=A sense of self-perceived collective victimhood in intractable conflicts|date=June 2009|department=Foundations|journal=[[International Review of the Red Cross]]|volume=91|number=874|pages=233|doi=10.1017/S1816383109990221|accessdate=August 21, 2018|postscript= ‚Üí Sense of Victimhood has 3 foundations: (1) rooted in a Realization of Harm Experienced either directly or indirectly (2) 'Victim': a social label ‚Üí result of Social Recognition of an act as illegitimate harm (3) Individuals Perceive Themselves as Victims ‚Üí often attempt to maintain this status}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water birth''' is [[childbirth]] that occurs in water. Proponents believe water birth results in a more relaxed, less painful experience that promotes a [[Midwifery|midwife]]-led model of care.&lt;ref name="Cochrane2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cluett|first1=E.

==Benefits==

A moderate to weak level of evidence indicates that water immersion during the first stage of childbirth reduces the pain of labor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A [[Cochrane Library|2018 Cochrane Review]] found that immersion during the first stage of [[childbirth]] reduces the use of [[epidural]]s, however there is no clear evidence on the benefits of water immersion for the second stage of labor or full water birth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is no evidence of increased [[adverse effect]]s for immersion during the first or second stages of labor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is not strong evidence that a water birth reduces tearing or perineal trauma.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Water birth may offer perineal support for a birthing mother, and some theorize that this may decrease the risk of tearing and reduce the use of [[episiotomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Garland | first = D | title = Waterbirth: An Attitude to Care | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 0750652020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 review reported that it has been found that water immersion during the first stage of labor can reduce the length of the first stage, reduce labor pain, and the use of epidural/spinal analgesia. It is also associated with a lower rate of [[cesarean delivery]] and [[stress urinary incontinence]]  symptoms 42 days after delivery.  The review reported that immersion during labor did not appear to increase the rate of infections for the mother or the baby, and [[APGAR]] scores for the baby were similar to that of conventional births.

==Risks and concerns==

The British [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] and the [[Royal College of Midwives]] issued a joint statement supporting water birth for healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies but does not recommend it in cases of complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Royal College of Midwives]]/[[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] | year = 2006 | url = http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/JointStatmentBirthInWater2006.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090413130622/http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/JointStatmentBirthInWater2006.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2009-04-13 | format = pdf | title = Immersion in water during labour and birth | accessdate = 2012-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 commentary, the Committee on Fetus and Newborn of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) released an analysis of the scientific literature regarding underwater births. The Committee noted several positive studies for underwater birth but went on to criticize them for lacking proper [[scientific control]]s, a significant number of infant deaths and diseases, and the general lack of information to support the use of water births. The paper concluded:&lt;ref name = AAP&gt;{{Cite journal | author1 = &lt;!-- comment to keep out Citation Bot --&gt;| last = Committee On Fetus Newborn | last2 = Blackmon | first2 = D.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The safety and efficacy of underwater birth for the newborn has not been established. There is no convincing evidence of benefit to the neonate but some concern for serious harm. Therefore, underwater birth should be considered an experimental procedure that should not be performed except within the context of an appropriately designed RCT after informed parental consent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The AAP received numerous letters in response to the statement, many claiming passionately that water birth had strong benefits and minimal risks for both parents and children and criticizing the AAP for failing to publish positive studies about the practice. In response, an author of the statement noted that the claims made were unsubstantiated and based purely on [[anecdotal evidence]], with no [[randomized controlled trial]]s (RCTs) that would allow an evidence-based assessment of the safety and benefits of water births. The author concluded by urging for proponents to support such a trial so that the question could be answered. The editor of the journal ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'', where the commentary was published, noted that no such trials had ever been submitted to the journal, which had a policy against publishing articles that are not based on scientific evidence. The reply concluded that "I have not received any science-based commentaries from the groups that you cite in your letter. We cannot publish every letter, based on opinions only, that we receive."&lt;ref name = AAPResponse&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hess | first1 = S. | title = Strong Opinions Versus Science in Water-Birth Controversy | doi = 10.1542/peds.2005-1334 | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 116 | issue = 2 | pages = 522‚Äì523; author 523 523 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16061620 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth pool==
A birth pool is a specially designed vessel containing water for women to immerse themselves in for pain relief during labour.  Birth pools work on the same principle as a bathtub, but are distinct from them&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harper, R.N.|first1=Barbara|title=Gentle Birth Choices|date=2005|publisher=Inner Traditions|isbn=1-59477-067-0|pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to buoyancy and freedom of movement, factors deemed to be important in labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tips on encouraging a straightforward birth during labour|url=http://www.nct.org.uk/birth/encouraging-straightforward-birth-what-do-labour|publisher=National Childbirth Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; A birth pool can either be permanently installed or portable. Getting into a pool of water for labour is often called ''water birth'' because some women choose to remain in the water for birth as well.

Health policy in England stipulates women should be given the opportunity to labour in water through the publication of Intrapartum care guidelines issued in 2007 by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence |National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)]].  The [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] and the [[Royal College of Midwives]] have jointly supported labour and birthing in water, and encourage hospitals to ensure birth pools are available to all women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joint Statement on Birth In Water|url=https://www.rcm.org.uk/sites/default/files/rcog_rcm_birth_in_water.pdf|agency=Joint Statement by RCM and RCOG|publisher=Royal College of Midwives RCM|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immersing in water in a birth pool is one of the methods available to manage pain during labour, in addition to [[TENS|TENS machine]], [[Gas and air]], [[Pethidine]] injection, [[deep breathing]], [[massage]] and [[epidural]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leap|first1=Nicky|last2=Dodwell|first2=Miranda|last3=Newburn|first3=Mary|title=Working with pain in labour|journal=New Digest|date=January 2010|volume=49|url=http://www.nct.org.uk/system/files/related_documents/Research%20overview-%20Working%20with%20pain%20in%20labour_6.pdf.|publisher=National Childbirth Trust NCT}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characteristics ===
Before birth pools became readily available there are many stories of women labouring and birthing in re-purposed tub-like products including animal watering troughs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Choosing Waterbirth|last = Bertram|first = Lakshmi|publisher = Hampton Roads Publishing Company, Inc|year = 2000|isbn = 1-57174-152-6|location = USA|pages = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordinary bathtubs found in American and British homes are not adequate to provide enough room for women to comfortably move and try different positions in labour, such as squatting or kneeling, and are not deep enough to create [[buoyancy]].  In order to create the feeling of weightlessness through buoyancy the water needs to almost cover the women's breasts while she is sitting and should cover her belly while she is squatting, leaning over the side of the pool or kneeling upright in the pool sitting back on her heels.

The original circular birth pool [[Michel Odent|Dr Michel Odent]] used at Pithiviers hospital (France) in the early 1980s was two meters in diameter and .6 meters deep, large enough to accommodate two people and make it difficult for interference during the birthing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gentle Birth Choices|last = Harper|first = Barbara|publisher = Inner Traditions|year = 2005|isbn = 1-59477-067-0|location = USA|pages = 175‚Äì176}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern birth pools are somewhat smaller with a diameter between 110-150 centimeters and at least twenty, preferably twenty-two, inches of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Waterbirth Handbook|last = Lichy|first = Dr. Roger|publisher = Gateway Books|year = 1993|isbn = 0-946551-70-7|location = UK|pages = 63, 132|last2 = Herzberg|first2 = Eileen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors to consider when choosing a birth pool are:
* Size ‚Äì is it appropriate for you and the place you will give birth
* Fill time and process ‚Äì how long will it take and what type of hose/spout is required

Birth pools are generally categorised between two broad types: permanently installed or portable.  Many hospitals in the United Kingdom now have a birth pool plumbed in, and portable birth pools can be purchased or hired for use at home or in hospital.

*Permanently Installed Birth Pools:  The [[National Health Service (NHS)]] purchases birth pools for hospital birth centres, delivery suites and community midwife teams throughout the country.
*Portable Birth Pools:  More often used for home births, portable birth pools can also be used within hospitals when a permanently installed birth pool is not available.

'''√Üthelstan''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|√¶|Œ∏|…ôl|s|t|√¶|n}}; died c. 852), the eldest son of King [[√Üthelwulf of Wessex]], was the [[List of monarchs of Kent|King of Kent]] from 839 under the authority of his father.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, √Üthelwulf&lt;/ref&gt; The late D, E and F versions of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' describe √Üthelstan as √Üthelwulf's brother, but the A, B and C versions, and [[√Üthelweard (historian)|√Üthelweard's]] ''Chronicon'', state that he was √Üthelwulf's son.&lt;ref name=Stenton236&gt;Stenton, p. 236, n. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have argued that it is more probable that he was a brother, including [[Eric John]] in 1966&lt;ref&gt;John, p. 41, n. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ann Williams (historian)|Ann Williams]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, "Some notes", pp. 145, 225, n. 10&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1991 Ann Williams described him as √Üthelwulf's son,&lt;ref&gt;Williams, "Athelstan"&lt;/ref&gt; and this is now generally accepted by historians, including [[Frank Stenton]],&lt;ref name=Stenton236/&gt; [[Barbara Yorke]],&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; and D. P. Kirby.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

When √Üthelwulf became [[King of the West Saxons]] in 839 on the death of his father, [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]], he appointed √Üthelstan to rule over Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex. He is styled king in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and [[√Üthelweard (historian)|√Üthelweard]]'s chronicle calls him "King of the Dwellers in [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], of the [[East Saxons]], of the [[South Saxons]] and of [[Surrey]]". He attested a number of his father's charters as king in the 840s.

In 851, √Üthelstan and [[Ealdorman]] Ealhhere defeated a [[Vikings|Viking]] fleet and army off Sandwich, Kent, described by Frank Stenton as "the first naval battle in recorded English history".&lt;ref&gt;Stenton, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;  √Üthelstan is not mentioned after 851 and presumably died before √Üthelwulf went to Rome in 855 as he was not included in arrangements for government of the kingdom during his father's absence.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes and Lapidge, pp. 69, 231-2, 235.&lt;/ref&gt; In 853 Ealhhere died in a disastrous defeat of the men of Kent and Surrey by the Vikings, and as √Üthelstan is not mentioned as present at the battle he was probably dead by then.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
