'''''Abstract and Applied Analysis''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[mathematics journal]] covering the fields of [[Analysis (mathematics)|abstract and applied analysis]] and traditional forms of analysis such as [[linear]] and [[nonlinear system|nonlinear]] ordinary and partial [[differential equation]]s, [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization theory]], and [[control theory]]. It is published by [[Hindawi Publishing Corporation]]. It was established by Athanassios G. Kartsatos ([[University of South Florida]]) in 1996, who was [[editor-in-chief]] until 2005. Martin Bohner (Missouri S&amp;T) was editor-in-chief from 2006 until 2011 when the journal converted to a model shared by all Hindawi journals of not having an editor-in-chief, with editorial decisions made by editorial board members. The journal has faced delisting from the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'' (thus not receive an [[impact factor]]), for anomalous citation patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Scientific World Journal Will Lose Its Impact Factor — Again |work=Scholarly Open Access |authorlink=Jeffrey Beall |first1=Jeffrey |last1=Beall |url=http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/10/14/the-scientific-world-journal-will-lose-its-impact-factor-again/ |accessdate=18 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017234232/http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/10/14/the-scientific-world-journal-will-lose-its-impact-factor-again/ |archivedate=17 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14115">In [[combinatorics]], '''Bertrand's ballot problem''' is the question: "In an [[election]] where candidate A receives ''p'' votes and candidate B receives ''q'' votes with ''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''q'', what is the [[probability]] that A will be strictly ahead of B throughout the count?"  The answer is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p-q}{p+q}.&lt;/math&gt;

The result was first published by [[William Allen Whitworth|W. A. Whitworth]] in 1878, but is named after [[Joseph Louis François Bertrand]] who rediscovered it in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An Introduction to Probability Theory and its Applications, Volume I|first=William|last=Feller|authorlink=William Feller|edition=3rd|publisher=Wiley|year=1968|page=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Bertrand, Solution d'un problème, Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences, Paris 105 (1887), 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bertrand's original paper, he sketches a proof based on a general formula for the number of favourable sequences using a [[recursion relation]].  He remarks that it seems probable that such a simple result could be proved by a more direct method. Such a proof was given by [[Désiré André]],&lt;ref&gt;D. André, Solution directe du problème résolu par M. Bertrand, Comptes Rendus de l’Académie des Sciences, Paris 105 (1887) 436–437.&lt;/ref&gt; based on the observation that the unfavourable sequences can be divided into two equally probable cases, one of which (the case where B receives the first vote) is easily computed; he proves the equality by an explicit [[bijection]]. A variation of his method is popularly known as '''André's reflection method''', although André did not use any reflections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webspace.ship.edu/msrenault/ballotproblem/monthly358-363-renault.pdf Renault, Marc, Lost (and found) in translation: André's actual method and its application to the generalized ballot problem. Amer. Math. Monthly 115 (2008), no. 4, 358--363.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Suppose there are 5 voters, of whom 3 vote for candidate ''A'' and 2 vote for candidate ''B'' (so ''p'' = 3 and ''q'' = 2).  There are ten possibilities for the order of the votes cast:
*''AAABB''
*''AABAB''
*''ABAAB''
*''BAAAB''
*''AABBA''
*''ABABA''
*''BAABA''
*''ABBAA''
*''BABAA''
*''BBAAA''
For the order ''AABAB'', the tally of the votes as the election progresses is:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
|  '''Candidate'''
|  ''A''
|  ''A''
|  ''B''
|  ''A''
|  ''B''
|-
|  '''''A'''''
|  1
|  2
|  2
|  3
|  3
|-
|  '''''B'''''
|  0
|  0
|  1
|  1
|  2
|}
For each column the tally for ''A'' is always larger than the tally for ''B'' so the ''A'' is always strictly ahead of ''B''. For the order ''AABBA'' the tally of the votes as the election progresses is:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
|  '''Candidate'''
|  ''A''
|  ''A''
|  ''B''
|  ''B''
|  ''A''
|-
|  '''''A'''''
|  1
|  2
|  2
|  2
|  3
|-
|  '''''B'''''
|  0
|  0
|  1
|  2
|  2
|}
For this order, ''B'' is tied with ''A'' after the fourth vote, so ''A'' is not always strictly ahead of ''B''.
Of the 10 possible orders, ''A'' is always ahead of ''B'' only for ''AAABB'' and ''AABAB''. So the probability that ''A'' will always be strictly ahead is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{10}=\frac{1}{5},&lt;/math&gt;
and this is indeed equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{3-2}{3+2}&lt;/math&gt; as the theorem predicts.

==Equivalent problems==
Rather than computing the probability that a random vote counting order has the desired property, one can instead compute the number of favourable counting orders, then divide by the total number of ways in which the votes could have been counted.  (This is the method used by Bertrand.)  The total number of ways is the [[binomial coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{p+q}{p}&lt;/math&gt;; Bertrand's proof shows that the number of favourable orders in which to count the votes is &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{p+q-1}{p-1}-\tbinom{p+q-1}{p}&lt;/math&gt; (though he does not give this number explicitly).  And indeed after division this gives &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{p}{p+q}-\tfrac{q}{p+q}=\tfrac{p-q}{p+q}&lt;/math&gt;.

Another equivalent problem is to calculate the number of [[random walk]]s on the [[integer]]s that consist of ''n'' steps of unit length, beginning at the origin and ending at the point ''m'', that never become negative. Assuming ''n'' and ''m'' have the same parity and ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0, this number is
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{\tfrac{n+m}2}-\binom{n}{\tfrac{n+m}2+1} = \frac{m+1}{\tfrac{n+m}2+1}\binom{n}{\tfrac{n+m}2}.&lt;/math&gt;
When ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''n'' is even, this gives the [[Catalan number]] &lt;math&gt;\frac1{\tfrac{n}2+1}\binom{n}{\tfrac{n}2}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Proof by reflection==
For A to be strictly ahead of B throughout the counting of the votes, there can be no ties.  Separate the counting sequences according to the first vote.  Any sequence that begins with a vote for B must reach a tie at some point, because A eventually wins.  For any sequence that begins with A and reaches a tie, reflect the votes up to the point of the first tie (so any A becomes a B, and vice versa) to obtain a sequence that begins with B.  Hence every sequence that begins with A and reaches a tie is in one-to-one correspondence with a sequence that begins with B, and the probability that a sequence begins with B is &lt;math&gt;q/(p+q)&lt;/math&gt;, so the probability that A always leads the vote is
:&lt;math&gt; = 1- &lt;/math&gt; the probability of sequences that tie at some point
:&lt;math&gt; = 1- &lt;/math&gt; the probability of sequences that tie at some point and begin with A or B
:&lt;math&gt; = 1-2\frac{q}{p+q}=\frac{p-q}{p+q}&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof by induction==
Another method of proof is by [[mathematical induction]]:
*We loosen the condition &lt;math&gt;p &gt; q&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;p \geq q&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly, the theorem is correct when &lt;math&gt;p = q&lt;/math&gt;, since in this case the first candidate will not be ''strictly'' ahead after all the votes have been counted (so the probability is 0).
*Clearly the theorem is true if ''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 when the probability is 1, given that the first candidate receives all the votes; it is also true when ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 as we have just seen.
*Assume it is true both when ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 and ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'', and when ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a'' and ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, with ''a''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. (We don't need to consider the case &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; here, since we have already disposed of it before.) Then considering the case with ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a'' and ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'', the last vote counted is either for the first candidate with probability  ''a''/(''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''), or for the second with probability ''b''/(''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'').  So the  probability of the first being ahead throughout the count to the penultimate vote counted (and also after the final vote) is:
::&lt;math&gt;{a \over (a+b)}{(a-1)-b \over (a+b-1)}+{b \over (a+b)}{a-(b-1) \over (a+b-1)}={a-b \over a+b}.&lt;/math&gt;
*And so it is true for all ''p'' and ''q'' with ''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.

== Proof by permutation ==

A simple proof is based on the beautiful Cycle Lemma of Dvoretzky and Motzkin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 =Dvoretzky| first1= Aryeh| last2= Motzkin| first2=Theodore |year=1947| title =A problem of arrangements|journal= Duke Mathematical Journal| volume = 14|pages = 305–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Call a ballot sequence ''dominating'' if A is strictly ahead of B throughout the counting of the votes. The Cycle Lemma asserts that any sequence of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; A's and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; B's, where &lt;math&gt;p&gt; q&lt;/math&gt;, has precisely &lt;math&gt;p-q&lt;/math&gt; dominating cyclic permutations. To see this, just arrange the given sequence of &lt;math&gt;p+q&lt;/math&gt; A's and B's in a circle and repeatedly remove adjacent pairs AB until only &lt;math&gt;p-q&lt;/math&gt; A's remain. Each of these A's was the start of a dominating cyclic permutation before anything was removed. So &lt;math&gt;p-q&lt;/math&gt; out of the &lt;math&gt;p+q&lt;/math&gt; cyclic permutations of any arrangement of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; A votes and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; B votes are dominating.

==Bertrand's and André's proofs==
Bertrand expressed the solution as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2m-\mu}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu=p+q&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of voters and &lt;math&gt;m=p&lt;/math&gt; is the number of voters for the first candidate.  He states that the result follows from the formula
:&lt;math&gt;P_{m+1,\mu+1}=P_{m,\mu}+P_{m+1,\mu},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;P_{m,\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of favourable sequences, but "it seems probable that such a simple result could be shown in a more direct way".  Indeed, a more direct proof was soon produced by Désiré André.  His approach is often mistakenly labelled "the reflection principle" by modern authors but in fact uses a permutation.  He shows that the "unfavourable" sequences (those that reach an intermediate tie) consist of an equal number of sequences that begin with A as those that begin with B.  Every sequence that begins with B is unfavourable, and there are &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{p+q-1}{q-1}&lt;/math&gt; such sequences with a B followed by an arbitrary sequence of (''q''-1) B's and ''p'' A's.  Each unfavourable sequence that begins with A can be transformed to an arbitrary sequence of (''q''-1) B's and ''p'' A's by finding the first B that violates the rule (by causing the vote counts to tie) and deleting it, and interchanging the order of the remaining parts.  To reverse the process, take any sequence of (''q''-1) B's and ''p'' A's and search from the end to find where the number of A's first exceeds the number of B's, and then interchange the order of the parts and place a B in between.  For example, the unfavourable sequence &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;AAB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;ABAA corresponds uniquely to the arbitrary sequence ABAA&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;AAB&lt;/span&gt;.  From this, it follows that the number of favourable sequences of ''p'' A's and ''q'' B's is
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{p+q}{q}-2\binom{p+q-1}{q-1}=\binom{p+q}{q}\frac{p-q}{p+q}&lt;/math&gt;
and thus the required probability is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p-q}{p+q}&lt;/math&gt;
as expected.

==Variant: ties allowed==
The original problem is to find the probability that the first candidate is always strictly ahead in the vote count.  One may instead consider the problem of finding the probability that the second candidate is never ahead (that is, with ties are allowed).  In this case, the answer is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p+1-q}{p+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
The variant problem can be solved by the reflection method in a similar way to the original problem.  The number of possible vote sequences is &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{p+q}{q}&lt;/math&gt;.  Call a sequence "bad" if the second candidate is ever ahead, and if the number of bad sequences can be enumerated then the number of "good" sequences can be found by subtraction and the probability can be computed.

Represent a voting sequence as a [[lattice path]] on the Cartesian plane as follows:
* Start the path at (0,&amp;nbsp;0)
* Each time a vote for the first candidate is received move right 1 unit.
* Each time a vote for the second candidate is received move up 1 unit.
Each such path corresponds to a unique sequence of votes and will end at (''p'', ''q''). A sequence is 'good' exactly when the corresponding path never goes above the diagonal line ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''; equivalently, a sequence is 'bad' exactly when the corresponding path touches the line ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.
[[Image:AndreReflection.svg|thumb|right|220px|'Bad' path (blue) and its reflected path (red)]]
For each 'bad' path ''P'', define a new path ''P''′ by reflecting the part of ''P'' up to the first point it touches the line across it. ''P''′ is a path from (−1,&amp;nbsp;1) to (''p'',&amp;nbsp;''q''). The same operation applied again restores the original ''P''. This produces a one-to-one correspondence between the 'bad' paths and the paths from (−1,&amp;nbsp;1) to (''p'',&amp;nbsp;''q''). The number of these paths is &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{p+q}{q-1}&lt;/math&gt; and so that is the number of 'bad' sequences. This leaves the number of 'good' sequences as
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{p+q}{q} - \binom{p+q}{q-1} = \binom{p+q}{q}\frac{p+1-q}{p+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
Since there are &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{p+q}{q}&lt;/math&gt; altogether, the probability of a sequence being good is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{p+1-q}{p+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

In fact, the solutions to the original problem and the variant problem are easily related.  For candidate A to be strictly ahead throughout the vote count, they must receive the first vote and for the remaining votes (ignoring the first) they must be either strictly ahead or tied throughout the count.  Hence the solution to the original problem is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{p+q}\frac{p-1+1-q}{p-1+1}=\frac{p-q}{p+q}&lt;/math&gt;
as required.

Conversely, the tie case can be derived from the non-tie case.  Note that the ''number'' of non-tie sequences with p+1 votes for A is equal to the number of tie sequences with p votes for A.  The number of non-tie votes with p + 1 votes for A votes is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{p + 1 - q}{p + 1 + q} \tbinom{p + 1 + q}{q} &lt;/math&gt;, which by algebraic manipulation is  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{p + 1 - q}{p + 1} \tbinom{p + q}{q}  &lt;/math&gt;, so the ''fraction'' of sequences with p votes for A votes is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{p + 1 - q}{p + 1}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10978">In [[mathematics]], a '''Bose–Mesner algebra''' is a special set of [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] which arise from a combinatorial structure known as an [[association scheme]], together with the usual set of rules for combining (forming the products of) those matrices, such that they form an [[associative algebra]], or, more precisely, a [[Unital algebra|unitary commutative algebra]]. Among these rules are:
:*the result of a product is also within the set of matrices,
:*there is an identity matrix in the set, and
:*taking products is [[Commutativity|commutative]].

Bose–Mesner algebras have applications in [[physics]] to [[spin model]]s, and in [[statistics]] to the [[design of experiments]]. They are named for [[R. C. Bose]] and Dale Marsh Mesner.&lt;ref&gt;Bose &amp; Mesner (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Let ''X'' be a set of ''v'' elements. Consider a partition of the 2-element subsets of ''X'' into ''n'' non-empty subsets, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; such that:
* given an &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, the number of &lt;math&gt;y \in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{x,y\} \in R_i&lt;/math&gt; depends only on i (and not on ''x''). This number will be denoted by v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, and
* given &lt;math&gt;x,y \in X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\{x,y\} \in R_k&lt;/math&gt;, the number of &lt;math&gt;z \in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{x,z\} \in R_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{z,y\} \in R_j&lt;/math&gt; depends only on ''i'',''j'' and ''k'' (and not on ''x'' and ''y''). This number will be denoted by &lt;math&gt;p^k_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.
This structure is enhanced by adding all pairs of repeated elements of ''X'' and collecting them in a subset ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. This enhancement permits the parameters ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'' to take on the value of zero, and lets some of ''x'',''y'' or ''z'' be equal.

A set with such an enhanced partition is called an [[Association scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|van Lint|1991|loc=pp.197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; One may view an association scheme as a partition of the edges of a [[complete graph]] (with vertex set ''X'') into n classes, often thought of as color classes. In this representation, there is a loop at each vertex and all the loops receive the same 0th color.

The association scheme can also be represented algebraically. Consider the [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; defined by:
: &lt;math&gt;(D_i)_{x,y} = \begin{cases} 
1,&amp; \text{if } \left(x,y\right)\in R_{i},\\ 
0,&amp; \text{otherwise.}  \end{cases} \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[vector space]] consisting of all [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] &lt;math&gt;\sideset{}{_{i=0}^{n}}\sum a_{i}D_{i}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;a_{i}&lt;/math&gt; complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Camion|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Delsarte|Levenshtein|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of an [[association scheme]] is equivalent to saying that the &lt;math&gt;D_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are ''v''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''v'' (0,1)-[[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] which satisfy

# &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric,
# &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^n D_{i}=J &lt;/math&gt; (the all-ones matrix),
# &lt;math&gt;D_0=I,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;D_i D_j = \sum_{k=0}^n p^k_{ij} D_k = D_j D_i,\qquad i,j=0,\ldots,n.&lt;/math&gt;

The (''x'',''y'')-th entry of the left side of 4. is the number of two colored paths of length two joining ''x'' and ''y'' (using "colors" ''i'' and ''j'') in the graph. Note that the rows and columns of &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; contain &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; 1s:

: &lt;math&gt;D_i J=J D_i = v_i J. \qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

From 1., these [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] are [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]]. From 2., &lt;math&gt;D_{0},\ldots,D_{n}&lt;/math&gt; are [[Linear independence|linearly independent]], and the dimension of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt;. From 4., &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is closed under multiplication, and multiplication is always associative. This [[Associative algebra|associative]] [[commutative algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''Bose–Mesner algebra''' of the [[association scheme]]. Since the [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; are symmetric and commute with each other, they can be simultaneously diagonalized. This means that there is a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; such that to each &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; there is a [[diagonal matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{A}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;S^{-1}A S=\Lambda_{A}&lt;/math&gt;. This means that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is semi-simple and has a unique basis of primitive idempotents &lt;math&gt;J_{0},\ldots,J_{n}&lt;/math&gt;. These are complex n &amp;times; n [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] satisfying

: &lt;math&gt;
J_i^2 =J_i, i=0,\ldots,n, \qquad (3)
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
J_i J_k=0, i\neq k, \qquad (4)
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i=0}^n J_i = I. \qquad (5)
&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Bose–Mesner algebra''' has two distinguished bases: the basis consisting of the [[Adjacency matrix|adjacency matrices]] &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the basis consisting of the irreducible [[Idempotent matrix|idempotent matrices]] &lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt;. By definition, there exist well-defined [[complex number]]s such that

: &lt;math&gt;
D_{i}=\sum_{k=0}^n p_i (k) E_k, \qquad (6)
&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;
|X|E_{k}=\sum_{i=0}^n q_k\left(i\right)D_i. \qquad (7)
&lt;/math&gt;

The p-numbers &lt;math&gt;p_i (k)&lt;/math&gt;, and the q-numbers &lt;math&gt;q_k(i)&lt;/math&gt;, play a prominent role in the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Camion|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; They satisfy well-defined orthogonality relations. The p-numbers are the [[eigenvalues]] of the [[adjacency matrix]] &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt;.

==Theorem==

The [[eigenvalues]] of &lt;math&gt;p_i(k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_k(i)&lt;/math&gt;, satisfy the orthogonality conditions:

: &lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k=0}^n \mu_i p_i (k)p_\ell (k)=v v_i \delta_{i \ell}, \quad(8)
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k=0}^n \mu_i q_k (i) q_\ell (i)=v \mu_k \delta_{k \ell}. \quad(9)
&lt;/math&gt;

Also

: &lt;math&gt;
\mu_j p_i (j) = v_i q_ j (i),\quad i,j=0,\ldots,n. \quad(10)
&lt;/math&gt;

In [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] notation, these are

: &lt;math&gt;
P^T \Delta_\mu P=v\Delta_v, \quad(11)
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
Q^T \Delta_v Q=v\Delta_\mu, \quad(12)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta_v = \operatorname{diag} \{v_0,v_1,\ldots,v_n\},\qquad \Delta_\mu = \operatorname{diag} \{\mu_0,\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof of theorem==

The [[eigenvalue]]s of &lt;math&gt;D_i D_\ell&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;p_i (k)p_\ell (k)&lt;/math&gt; with multiplicities &lt;math&gt;\mu_k&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that

: &lt;math&gt;
v v_i \delta_{i\ell} = \operatorname{trace}D_i D_\ell = \sum_{k=0}^n \mu_i p_i(k) p_\ell (k), \quad(13)
&lt;/math&gt;

which proves Equation &lt;math&gt;\left(8\right)&lt;/math&gt; and Equation &lt;math&gt;\left(11\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;
Q = v P^{-1} = \Delta_v^{-1} P^T \Delta_\mu, \quad(14)
&lt;/math&gt;

which gives Equations &lt;math&gt;(9)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(10)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(12)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

There is an analogy between extensions of [[association scheme]]s and [[Kronecker's theorem|extensions]] of [[finite field]]s. The cases we are most interested in are those where the extended schemes are defined on the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th [[Cartesian power]] &lt;math&gt;X=\mathcal{F}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; of a set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; on which a basic [[association scheme]] &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathcal{F},K\right)&lt;/math&gt; is defined. A first [[association scheme]] defined on &lt;math&gt;X=\mathcal{F}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; is called the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th [[Kronecker product|Kronecker power]] &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathcal{F},K\right)_{\otimes}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathcal{F},K\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Next the extension is defined on the same set &lt;math&gt;X=\mathcal{F}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; by gathering classes of &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathcal{F},K\right)_{\otimes}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Kronecker product|Kronecker power]] corresponds to the [[polynomial ring]] &lt;math&gt;F\left[X\right]&lt;/math&gt; first defined on a [[Finite field|field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}&lt;/math&gt;, while the extension scheme corresponds to the [[extension field]] obtained as a quotient. An example of such an extended scheme is the [[Hamming scheme]].

[[Association scheme]]s may be merged, but merging them leads to non-symmetric [[association scheme]]s, whereas all usual [[code]]s are [[subgroup]]s in symmetric [[Abelian variety|Abelian schemes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Delsarte|Levenshtein|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Camion|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacWilliams|Sloane|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6215">In the theory of [[random matrix|random matrices]], the '''circular ensembles''' are  measures on  spaces of [[unitary matrix|unitary matrices]] introduced by [[Freeman Dyson]] as modifications of the [[Gaussian matrix ensemble]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F.M. Dyson|title=The threefold way. Algebraic structure of symmetry groups and ensembles in quantum mechanics|journal=J. Math. Phys.|volume=3|page=1199|year=1962|doi=10.1063/1.1703863|bibcode=1962JMP.....3.1199D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main examples are the '''circular orthogonal ensemble''' (COE) on symmetric unitary matrices, the '''circular unitary ensemble''' (CUE) on unitary matrices, and  the '''circular symplectic ensemble''' (CSE) on self dual unitary quaternionic  matrices.

==Probability distributions==

The distribution of the unitary circular ensemble CUE(''n'') is the [[Haar measure]] on the [[unitary group]] ''U(n)''. If ''U'' is a random element of CUE(''n''), then ''U&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;U'' is a random element of COE(''n''); if ''U'' is a random element of CUE(''2n''), then ''U&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;U'' is a random element of CSE(''n''), where 
: &lt;math&gt; U^R = \left( \begin{array}{ccccccc} 0 &amp; -1 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;  \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp;  &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp;  &amp; &amp;  \\ &amp; &amp; 1 &amp; 0  &amp; &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \ddots &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 0&amp; -1\\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{array} \right) U^T \left( \begin{array}{ccccccc} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;  \\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp;  &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp;  &amp; &amp;  \\ &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; 0  &amp; &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \ddots &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 0&amp; 1\\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \end{array} \right)~. &lt;/math&gt;

Each element of a circular ensemble is a unitary matrix, so it has eigenvalues on the unit circle: &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k=e^{i\theta_k}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \theta_k &lt; 2\pi&lt;/math&gt; for ''k=1,2,... n'', where the &lt;math&gt;\theta_k&lt;/math&gt; are also known as '''eigenangles''' or '''eigenphases'''. In the CSE each of these ''n'' eigenvalues appears twice. The distributions have [[probability density function|densities]] with respect to the eigenangles, given by
: &lt;math&gt; p(\theta_1, \cdots, \theta_n) = \frac{1}{Z_{n,\beta}} \prod_{1 \leq k &lt; j \leq n} |e^{i \theta_k} - e^{i \theta_j}|^\beta~&lt;/math&gt;
on &lt;math&gt;\R_{[0,2\pi]}^n&lt;/math&gt; (symmetrized version), where β=1 for COE, β=2 for CUE, and β=4 for CSE. The normalisation constant ''Z&lt;sub&gt;n,β&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by
: &lt;math&gt; Z_{n,\beta} = (2\pi)^n \frac{\Gamma(\beta n/2 + 1)}{\left(\Gamma(\beta/2 + 1)\right)^n}~,&lt;/math&gt;
as can be verified via [[Selberg integral|Selberg's integral formula]], or Weyl's integral formula for compact Lie groups.

==Generalizations==

Generalizations of the circular ensemble restrict the matrix elements of ''U'' to real numbers [so that ''U'' is in the [[orthogonal group]] ''O(n)''] or to real [[quaternion]] numbers [so that ''U'' is in the [[symplectic group]] ''Sp(2n)''. The Haar measure on the orthogonal group produces the '''circular real ensemble''' (CRE) and the Haar measure on the symplectic group produces the '''circular quaternion ensemble''' (CQE).

The eigenvalues of orthogonal matrices come in complex conjugate pairs &lt;math&gt;e^{i\theta_k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^{-i\theta_k}&lt;/math&gt;, possibly complemented by eigenvalues fixed at ''+1'' or ''-1''. For ''n=2m'' even and ''det U=1'', there are no fixed eigenvalues and the phases ''θ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' have probability distribution &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=V.L. Girko|title=Distribution of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of orthogonal random matrices|journal=Ukr. Math. J.|volume=37|page=457|year=1985|doi=10.1007/bf01061167}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; p(\theta_1, \cdots, \theta_m) = C \prod_{1 \leq k &lt; j \leq m} (\cos\theta_k - \cos\theta_j)^2~,&lt;/math&gt;
with ''C'' an unspecified normalization constant. For ''n=2m+1'' odd there is one fixed eigenvalue ''σ=det U'' equal to ±1. The phases have distribution
: &lt;math&gt; p(\theta_1, \cdots, \theta_m) = C \prod_{1 \leq i \leq m}(1-\sigma\cos\theta_i)  \prod_{1 \leq k &lt; j \leq m} (\cos\theta_k - \cos\theta_j)^2~.&lt;/math&gt;
For ''n=2m+2'' even and ''det U=-1'' there is a pair of eigenvalues fixed at ''+1'' and ''-1'', while the phases have distribution
: &lt;math&gt; p(\theta_1, \cdots, \theta_m) = C \prod_{1 \leq i \leq m}(1-\cos^2\theta_i)  \prod_{1 \leq k &lt; j \leq m} (\cos\theta_k - \cos\theta_j)^2~.&lt;/math&gt;
This is also the distribution of the eigenvalues of a matrix in ''Sp(2m)''.
 
These probability density functions are referred to as '''Jacobi distributions''' in the theory of random matrices, because correlation functions can be expressed in terms of [[Jacobi polynomials]].

==Calculations==

Averages of products of matrix elements in the circular ensembles can be calculated using [[Weingarten function]]s. For large dimension of the matrix these calculations become impractical, and a numerical method is advantageous. There exist efficient algorithms to generate random matrices in the circular ensembles, for example by performing a [[QR decomposition]] on a Ginibre matrix. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. Mezzadri|title=How to generate random matrices from the classical compact groups|journal=Notices of the AMS|volume=54|page=592|year=2007|arxiv=math-ph/0609050|bibcode=2006math.ph...9050M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2061">In [[mathematics]], a '''complex analytic space''' is a generalization of a [[complex manifold]] which allows the presence of [[singularity theory|singularities]]. Complex analytic spaces are [[locally ringed space]]s which are locally isomorphic to local model spaces, where a local model space is an open subset of the vanishing locus of a finite set of [[holomorphic function]]s.

==Definition==
Denote the constant [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] on a topological space with value &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathbb{C}}&lt;/math&gt;. A '''&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;-space''' is a [[locally ringed space]] &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{O}_X)&lt;/math&gt; whose structure sheaf is an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] over &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathbb{C}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Choose an open subset &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of some [[complex affine space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;, and fix finitely many holomorphic functions &lt;math&gt;f_1,\dots,f_k&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;X=V(f_1,\dots,f_k)&lt;/math&gt; be the common vanishing locus of these holomorphic functions, that is, &lt;math&gt;X=\{x\mid f_1(x)=\cdots=f_k(x)=0\}&lt;/math&gt;. Define a sheaf of rings on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by letting &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt; be the restriction to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_U/(f_1, \ldots, f_k)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_U&lt;/math&gt; is the sheaf of holomorphic functions on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. Then the locally ringed &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;-space &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{O}_X)&lt;/math&gt; is a '''local model space'''.

A '''complex analytic space''' is a locally ringed &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;-space &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{O}_X)&lt;/math&gt; which is locally isomorphic to a local model space.

Morphisms of complex analytic spaces are defined to be morphisms of the underlying locally ringed spaces, they are also called holomorphic maps.

'''Computational fluid dynamics''' ('''CFD''') is a branch of [[fluid mechanics]] that uses [[numerical analysis]] and [[data structure]]s to analyze and solve problems that involve [[fluid dynamics|fluid flows]].  Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the free-stream flow of the fluid, and the interaction of the fluid ([[Liquid|liquids]] and [[Gas|gases]]) with surfaces defined by [[Boundary value problem#Boundary value conditions|boundary conditions]]. With high-speed [[supercomputer]]s, better solutions can be achieved, and are often required to solve the largest and most complex problems. Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as [[transonic]] or [[turbulence|turbulent]] flows. Initial validation of such software is typically performed using experimental apparatus such as  [[wind tunnel|wind tunnels]].  In addition, previously performed [[Closed-form solution|analytical]] or [[Empirical research|empirical]] analysis of a particular problem can be used for comparison.  A final validation is often performed using full-scale testing, such as [[flight test]]s.

CFD is applied to a wide range of research and engineering problems in many fields of study and industries, including [[aerodynamics]] and aerospace analysis, [[Numerical weather prediction|weather simulation]], natural science and [[environmental engineering]], industrial system design and analysis, [[biological engineering]] and fluid flows, and [[engine]] and [[combustion]] analysis.

==Background and history==
[[Image:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|right|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around the [[Space Shuttle]] during re-entry.]]
[[Image:X-43A (Hyper - X) Mach 7 computational fluid dynamic (CFD).jpg|thumb|right|A simulation of the [[Hyper-X]] scramjet vehicle in operation at [[Mach number|Mach]]-7]] The fundamental basis of almost all CFD problems is the [[Navier–Stokes equations]], which define many single-phase (gas or liquid, but not both) fluid flows.  These equations can be simplified by removing terms describing [[viscous]] actions to yield the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]].  Further simplification, by removing terms describing [[vorticity]] yields the [[full potential equation]]s. Finally, for small [[Perturbation theory|perturbation]]s in subsonic and [[supersonic]] flows (not [[transonic]] or [[hypersonic]]) these equations can be [[Linearization|linearized]] to yield the linearized potential equations.

Historically, methods were first developed to solve the linearized potential equations. Two-dimensional (2D) methods, using [[conformal transformation]]s of the flow about a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] to the flow about an [[airfoil]] were developed in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milne-Thomson|first=L.M.|authorlink=L. M. Milne-Thomson|title=Theoretical Aerodynamics|year=1973|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-61980-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest type of calculations resembling modern CFD are those by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]], in the sense that these calculations used finite differences and divided the physical space in cells. Although they failed dramatically, these calculations, together with Richardson's book "Weather prediction by numerical process",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Weather prediction by numerical process|year=1965|publisher=Dover Publications|author=Richardson, L. F.|author2=Chapman, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; set the basis for modern CFD and numerical meteorology. In fact, early CFD calculations during the 1940s using [[ENIAC]] used methods close to those in Richardson's 1922 book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunt|title=Lewis Fry Richardson and his contributions to mathematics, meteorology, and models of conflict|journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics|year=1997|volume=30|doi=10.1146/annurev.fluid.30.1.0|bibcode = 1998AnRFM..30D..13H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computer power available paced development of [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] methods.  Probably the first work using computers to model fluid flow, as governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, was performed at [[Los Alamos National Lab]], in the T3 group.&lt;ref name=legacy_T3&gt;{{cite web|title=The Legacy of Group T-3|url=https://www.lanl.gov/orgs/t/t3/history.shtml#early|accessdate=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harlow2004fluid&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harlow|first=F.

Harlow]], who is widely considered as one of the pioneers of CFD. From 1957 to late 1960s, this group developed a variety of numerical methods to simulate transient two-dimensional fluid flows, such as 
[[Particle-in-cell]] method (Harlow, 1957),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Francis H. Harlow|F.H. Harlow]]|title=A Machine Calculation Method for Hydrodynamic Problems|publisher=Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory report LAMS-1956|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first paper with three-dimensional model was published by John Hess and [[A.M.O. Smith]] of [[Douglas Aircraft]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hess|first=J.L.|author2=A.M.O.

Their method itself was simplified, in that it did not include lifting flows and hence was mainly applied to ship hulls and aircraft fuselages.  The first lifting Panel Code (A230) was described in a paper written by Paul Rubbert and Gary Saaris of Boeing Aircraft in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Rubbert, Paul and Saaris, Gary, "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1972-188 Review and Evaluation of a Three-Dimensional Lifting Potential Flow Analysis Method for Arbitrary Configurations]," AIAA paper 72-188, presented at the AIAA 10th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, San Diego California, January 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;  In time, more advanced three-dimensional Panel Codes were developed at [[Boeing]] (PANAIR, A502),&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, R. and Erickson, L.L., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1981-1255 PAN AIR - A Higher Order Panel Method for Predicting Subsonic or Supersonic Linear Potential Flows About Arbitrary Configurations]," AIAA paper 81-1255, presented at the AIAA 14th Fluid and Plasma Dynamics Conference, Palo Alto California, June 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] (Quadpan),&lt;ref&gt;Youngren, H.H., Bouchard, E.E., Coopersmith, R.M. and Miranda, L.R., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1983-1827 Comparison of Panel Method Formulations and its Influence on the Development of QUADPAN, an Advanced Low Order Method]," AIAA paper 83-1827, presented at the AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Conference, Danvers, Massachusetts, July 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] (HESS),&lt;ref&gt;Hess, J.L. and Friedman, D.M., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1983-1828 Analysis of Complex Inlet Configurations Using a Higher-Order Panel Method]," AIAA paper 83-1828, presented at the AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Conference, Danvers, Massachusetts, July 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; [[McDonnell Aircraft]] (MACAERO),&lt;ref&gt;Bristow, D.R., "[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19800007773.pdf Development of Panel Methods for Subsonic Analysis and Design]," NASA CR-3234, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]] (PMARC)&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, Dale L.; Dudley, Michael R.; Iguchi, Steve K.; Browne, Lindsey and Katz, Joseph, “[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19920023178.pdf Potential Flow Theory and Operation Guide for the Panel Code PMARC]”, NASA NASA-TM-102851 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and Analytical Methods (WBAERO,&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, F.A., Dvorak, F.A. and Geller, E.W., "[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/782202.pdf A Computer Program for Three-Dimensional Lifting Bodies in Subsonic Inviscid Flow]," USAAMRDL Technical Report, TR 74-18, Ft. Eustis, Virginia, April 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; USAERO&lt;ref&gt;Katz, J. and Maskew, B., "Unsteady Low-Speed Aerodynamic Model for Complete Aircraft Configurations," AIAA paper 86-2180, presented at the AIAA Atmospheric Flight Mechanics Conference, Williamsburg Virginia, August 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and VSAERO&lt;ref&gt;Maskew, Brian, "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/3.57369 Prediction of Subsonic Aerodynamic Characteristics: A Case for Low-Order Panel Methods]," AIAA paper 81-0252, presented at the AIAA 19th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, St. Louis, Missouri, January 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maskew, Brian, “[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19900004884.pdf Program VSAERO Theory Document: A Computer Program for Calculating Nonlinear Aerodynamic Characteristics of Arbitrary Configurations]”, NASA CR-4023, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;).  Some (PANAIR, HESS and MACAERO) were higher order codes, using higher order distributions of surface singularities, while others (Quadpan, PMARC, USAERO and VSAERO) used single singularities on each surface panel.  The advantage of the lower order codes was that they ran much faster on the computers of the time.  Today, VSAERO has grown to be a multi-order code and is the most widely used program of this class. It has been used in the development of many [[submarine]]s, surface [[ship]]s, [[automobile]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[aircraft]], and more recently [[wind turbines]].  Its sister code, USAERO is an unsteady panel method that has also been used for modeling such things as high speed trains and racing [[yacht]]s.  The NASA PMARC code from an early version of VSAERO and a derivative of PMARC, named CMARC,&lt;ref&gt;Pinella, David and Garrison, Peter, “Digital Wind Tunnel CMARC; Three-Dimensional Low-Order Panel Codes,” Aerologic, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is also commercially available.

In the two-dimensional realm, a number of Panel Codes have been developed for airfoil analysis and design.  The codes typically have a [[boundary layer]] analysis included, so that viscous effects can be modeled.  Professor Richard Eppler of the [[University of Stuttgart]] developed the [http://www.pdas.com/eppler.html PROFILE] code, partly with NASA funding, which became available in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Eppler, R.; Somers, D. M., "[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19800020753.pdf A Computer Program for the Design and Analysis of Low-Speed Airfoils]," NASA TM-80210, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was soon followed by [[MIT]] Professor Mark Drela's [[XFOIL]] code.&lt;ref&gt;Drela, Mark, "[http://www.web.mit.edu/drela/Public/papers/xfoil_sv.pdf XFOIL: An Analysis and Design System for Low Reynolds Number Airfoils]," in Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Engineering, No. 54, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Both PROFILE and XFOIL incorporate two-dimensional panel codes, with coupled boundary layer codes for airfoil analysis work.  PROFILE uses a [[conformal transformation]] method for inverse airfoil design, while XFOIL has both a conformal transformation and an inverse panel method for airfoil design.

An intermediate step between Panel Codes and Full Potential codes were codes that used the Transonic Small Disturbance equations.  In particular, the three-dimensional WIBCO code,&lt;ref&gt;Boppe, C.W., "Calculation of Transonic Wing Flows by Grid Embedding," AIAA paper 77-207, presented at the AIAA 15th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Los Angeles California, January 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; developed by Charlie Boppe of [[Grumman Aircraft]] in the early 1980s has seen heavy use.

Developers turned to Full Potential codes, as panel methods could not calculate the non-linear flow present at [[transonic]] speeds.  The first description of a means of using the Full Potential equations was published by Earll Murman and [[Julian Cole]] of Boeing in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Murman, Earll and Cole, Julian, "Calculation of Plane Steady Transonic Flow," AIAA paper 70-188, presented at the AIAA 8th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, New York New York, January 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Frances Bauer, [[Paul Garabedian]] and [[David Korn (computer scientist)|David Korn]] of the Courant Institute at [[New York University]] (NYU) wrote a series of two-dimensional Full Potential airfoil codes that were widely used, the most important being named Program H.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, F., Garabedian, P., and Korn, D. G., "A Theory of Supercritical Wing Sections, with Computer Programs and Examples," Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems 66, Springer-Verlag, May 1972. {{ISBN|978-3540058076}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further growth of Program H was developed by Bob Melnik and his group at [[Grumman Aerospace]] as Grumfoil.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, H. R.; Melnik, R. E., "[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19860002735.pdf GRUMFOIL: A computer code for the viscous transonic flow over airfoils]," NASA CR-3806, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Antony Jameson]], originally at Grumman Aircraft and the Courant Institute of NYU, worked with David Caughey to develop the important three-dimensional Full Potential code FLO22&lt;ref&gt;Jameson A. and Caughey D., "A Finite Volume Method for Transonic Potential Flow Calculations," AIAA paper 77-635, presented at the Third AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Conference, Alburquerque New Mexico, June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1975.  Many Full Potential codes emerged after this, culminating in Boeing's Tranair (A633) code,&lt;ref&gt;Samant, S.S., Bussoletti J.E., Johnson F.T., Burkhart, R.H., Everson, B.L., Melvin, R.G., Young, D.P., Erickson, L.L., Madson M.D. and Woo, A.C., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1987-34 TRANAIR: A Computer Code for Transonic Analyses of Arbitrary Configurations]," AIAA paper 87-0034, presented at the AIAA 25th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Reno Nevada, January 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; which still sees heavy use.

The next step was the Euler equations, which promised to provide more accurate solutions of transonic flows.  The methodology used by Jameson in his three-dimensional FLO57 code&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, A., Schmidt, W. and Turkel, E., "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.464.3391&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Numerical Solution of the Euler Equations by Finite Volume Methods Using Runge-Kutta Time-Stepping Schemes]," AIAA paper 81-1259, presented at the AIAA 14th Fluid and Plasma Dynamics
Conference, Palo Alto California, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; (1981) was used by others to produce such programs as Lockheed's TEAM program&lt;ref&gt;Raj, P. and Brennan, J.E., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/3.45717 Improvements to an Euler Aerodynamic Method for Transonic Flow Simulation]," AIAA paper 87-0040, presented at the 25th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Reno Nevada, January 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; and IAI/Analytical Methods' MGAERO program.&lt;ref&gt;Tidd, D.M., Strash, D.J., Epstein, B., Luntz, A., Nachshon A. and Rubin T., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1991-3236 Application of an Efficient 3-D Multigrid Euler Method (MGAERO) to Complete Aircraft Configurations]," AIAA paper 91-3236, presented at the AIAA 9th Applied Aerodynamics Conference, Baltimore Maryland, September 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  MGAERO is unique in being a structured [[cartesian coordinate system|cartesian]] mesh code, while most other such codes use structured body-fitted grids (with the exception of NASA's highly successful CART3D code,&lt;ref&gt;Melton, J.E., Berger, M.J., Aftosmis, M.J. and Wong, M.D., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1995-853 3D Application of a Cartesian Grid Euler Method]," AIAA paper 95-0853, presented at the 33rd Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, Reno Nevada, January 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Lockheed's SPLITFLOW code&lt;ref&gt;Karmna, Steve L. Jr., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1995-343 SPLITFLOW: A 3D Unstructurted Cartesian Prismatic Grid CFD Code for Complex Geometries]," AIAA paper 95-0343, presented at the 33rd Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, Reno Nevada, January 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]]'s NASCART-GT).&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, D., and Ruffin, S.M., " [http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1084&amp;context=aero_fac An Embedded Boundary Cartesian Grid Scheme for Viscous Flows using a New Viscous Wall Boundary Condition Treatment],” AIAA Paper 2004-0581, presented at the AIAA 42nd Aerospace Sciences Meeting, January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antony Jameson]] also developed the three-dimensional AIRPLANE code&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, A., Baker, T.J. and Weatherill, N.P., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1986-103 Calculation of Inviscid Tramonic Flow over a Complete Aircraft]," AIAA paper 86-0103, presented at the AIAA 24th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Reno Nevada, January 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; which made use of unstructured tetrahedral grids.

In the two-dimensional realm, Mark Drela and Michael Giles, then graduate students at MIT, developed the ISES Euler program&lt;ref&gt;Giles, M., Drela, M. and Thompkins, W.T. Jr., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1985-1530 Newton Solution of Direct and Inverse Transonic Euler Equations]," AIAA paper 85-1530, presented at the Third Symposium on Numerical and Physical Aspects of Aerodynamic Flows, Long Beach, California, January 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; (actually a suite of programs) for airfoil design and analysis.  This code first became available in 1986 and has been further developed to design, analyze and optimize single or multi-element airfoils, as the MSES program.&lt;ref&gt;Drela, M. "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1990-1470 Newton Solution of Coupled Viscous/Inviscid Multielement Airfoil Flows],", AIAA paper 90-1470, presented at the AIAA 21st Fluid Dynamics, Plasma Dynamics and Lasers Conference, Seattle Washington, June 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  MSES sees wide use throughout the world.  A derivative of MSES, for the design and analysis of airfoils in a cascade, is MISES,&lt;ref&gt;Drela, M. and Youngren H., "A User's Guide to MISES 2.53", MIT Computational Sciences Laboratory, December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; developed by Harold "Guppy" Youngren while he was a graduate student at MIT.

The Navier–Stokes equations were the ultimate target of development.  Two-dimensional codes, such as NASA Ames' ARC2D code first emerged.  A number of three-dimensional codes were developed (ARC3D, [[Overflow (software)|OVERFLOW]], CFL3D are three successful NASA contributions), leading to numerous commercial packages.

==Methodology==
In all of these approaches the same basic procedure is followed.
* During [[preprocessor (CAE)|preprocessing]]
** The [[geometry]] and physical bounds of the problem can be defined using [[Computer-aided design|computer aided design]] (CAD). From there, data can be suitably processed (cleaned-up) and the fluid volume (or fluid domain) is extracted.
** The [[volume]] occupied by the fluid is divided into discrete cells (the mesh). The mesh may be uniform or non-uniform, structured or unstructured, consisting of a combination of hexahedral, tetrahedral, prismatic, pyramidal or polyhedral elements.
** The physical modeling is defined – for example, the equations of fluid motion + [[enthalpy]] + radiation + species conservation
** Boundary conditions are defined. This involves specifying the fluid behaviour and properties at all bounding surfaces of the fluid domain. For transient problems, the initial conditions are also defined.
* The [[computer simulation|simulation]] is started and the equations are solved iteratively as a steady-state or transient.
* Finally a postprocessor is used for the analysis and visualization of the resulting solution.

===Discretization methods===
{{further|Discretization of Navier–Stokes equations}}

The stability of the selected discretisation is generally established numerically rather than analytically as with simple linear problems.  Special care must also be taken to ensure that the discretisation handles discontinuous solutions gracefully.  The [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] and [[Navier–Stokes equations]] both admit shocks, and contact surfaces.

Some of the discretization methods being used are:

==== Finite volume method ====

{{Main article|Finite volume method}}

The finite volume method (FVM) is a common approach used in CFD codes, as it has an advantage in [[Random-access memory|memory]] usage and solution speed, especially for large problems, high [[Reynolds number]] turbulent flows, and source term dominated flows (like combustion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patankar|first=Suhas V.|authorlink=Suhas Patankar|title=Numerical Heat Transfer and Fluid FLow|year=1980|publisher=Hemisphere Publishing Corporation
|isbn=0891165223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the finite volume method, the governing partial differential equations (typically the Navier-Stokes equations, the mass and energy conservation equations, and the turbulence equations) are recast in a conservative form, and then solved over discrete control volumes. This [[discretization]] guarantees the conservation of fluxes through a particular control volume. The finite volume equation yields governing equations in the form,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\iiint Q\, dV + \iint F\, d\mathbf{A} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of conserved variables, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of fluxes (see [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] or [[Navier–Stokes equations]]), &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the control volume element, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the surface area of the control volume element.

==== Finite element method ====

{{Main article|Finite element method}}

The finite element method (FEM) is used in structural analysis of solids, but is also applicable to fluids.  However, the FEM formulation requires special care to ensure a conservative solution. The FEM formulation has been adapted for use with fluid dynamics governing equations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Although FEM must be carefully formulated to be conservative, it is much more stable than the finite volume approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In this method, a weighted residual equation is formed:

:&lt;math&gt;R_i = \iiint W_i Q \, dV^e&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; is the equation residual at an element vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the conservation equation expressed on an element basis, &lt;math&gt;W_i&lt;/math&gt; is the weight factor, and &lt;math&gt;V^{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the element.

==== Finite difference method ====

{{Main article|Finite difference method}}

The finite difference method (FDM) has historical importance{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and is simple to program.  It is currently only used in few specialized codes, which handle complex geometry with high accuracy and efficiency by using embedded boundaries or overlapping grids (with the solution interpolated across each grid).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} 
:&lt;math&gt; 
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t}+
\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}+
\frac{\partial G}{\partial y}+
\frac{\partial H}{\partial z}=0
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of conserved variables, and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; are the fluxes in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; directions respectively.

==== Spectral element method ====

{{Main article|Spectral element method}}

Spectral element method is a finite element type method. It requires the mathematical problem (the partial differential equation) to be cast in a weak formulation. This is typically done by multiplying the differential equation by an arbitrary test function and integrating over the whole domain. Purely mathematically, the test functions are completely arbitrary - they belong to an infinite-dimensional function space. Clearly an infinite-dimensional function space cannot be represented on a discrete spectral element mesh; this is where the spectral element discretization begins. The most crucial thing is the choice of interpolating and testing functions. In a standard, low order FEM in 2D, for quadrilateral elements the most typical choice is the bilinear test or interpolating function of the form &lt;math&gt;v(x,y) = ax+by+cxy+d&lt;/math&gt;. In a spectral element method however, the interpolating and test functions are chosen to be polynomials of a very high order (typically e.g. of the 10th order in CFD applications). This guarantees the rapid convergence of the method. Furthermore, very efficient integration procedures must be used, since the number of integrations to be performed in numerical codes is big. Thus, high order Gauss integration quadratures are employed, since they achieve the highest accuracy with the smallest number of computations to be carried out.
At the time there are some academic CFD codes based on the spectral element method and some more are currently under development, since the new time-stepping schemes arise in the scientific world.

==== Boundary element method ====

{{Main article|Boundary element method}}

In the boundary element method, the boundary occupied by the fluid is divided into a surface mesh.

==== High-resolution discretization schemes ====

{{Main article|High-resolution scheme}}

High-resolution schemes are used where shocks or discontinuities are present. Capturing sharp changes in the solution requires the use of second or higher-order numerical schemes that do not introduce spurious oscillations. This usually necessitates the application of [[flux limiters]] to ensure that the solution is [[total variation diminishing]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Turbulence models===

In computational modeling of turbulent flows, one common objective is to obtain a model that can predict quantities of interest, such as fluid velocity, for use in engineering designs of the system being modeled.  For turbulent flows, the range of length scales and complexity of phenomena involved in turbulence make most modeling approaches prohibitively expensive; the resolution required to resolve all scales involved in turbulence is beyond what is computationally possible.  The primary approach in such cases is to create numerical models to approximate unresolved phenomena.  This section lists some commonly used computational models for turbulent flows.

Turbulence models can be classified based on computational expense, which corresponds to the range of scales that are modeled versus resolved (the more turbulent scales that are resolved, the finer the resolution of the simulation, and therefore the higher the computational cost). If a majority or all of the turbulent scales are not modeled, the computational cost is very low, but the tradeoff comes in the form of decreased accuracy.

In addition to the wide range of length and time scales and the associated computational cost, the governing equations of fluid dynamics contain a [[Nonlinear system|non-linear]] convection term and a non-linear and non-local pressure gradient term.  These nonlinear equations must be solved numerically with the appropriate boundary and initial conditions.

==== Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes ====
{{main article|Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations}}

[[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations|Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes]] (RANS) equations are the oldest approach to turbulence modeling. An ensemble version of the governing equations is solved, which introduces new ''apparent stresses'' known as [[Reynolds stresses]]. This adds a second order tensor of unknowns for which various models can provide different levels of closure. It is a common misconception that the RANS equations do not apply to flows with a time-varying mean flow because these equations are 'time-averaged'. In fact, statistically unsteady (or non-stationary) flows can equally be treated. This is sometimes referred to as URANS. There is nothing inherent in Reynolds averaging to preclude this, but the turbulence models used to close the equations are valid only as long as the time over which these changes in the mean occur is large compared to the time scales of the turbulent motion containing most of the energy.

RANS models can be divided into two broad approaches:

; [[Turbulence modeling|Boussinesq hypothesis]]: This method involves using an algebraic equation for the Reynolds stresses which include determining the turbulent viscosity, and depending on the level of sophistication of the model, solving transport equations for determining the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation. Models include k-ε ([[Brian Launder|Launder]] and [[Brian Spalding|Spalding]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Launder|first=B.E.|author2=D.B. Spalding|year=1974|title= The Numerical Computation of Turbulent Flows|journal=Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering|pages=269–289|doi = 10.1016/0045-7825(74)90029-2|bibcode = 1974CMAME...3..269L|volume=3|issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixing Length Model ([[Ludwig Prandtl|Prandtl]]),&lt;ref name=wilcox&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=David C.|title=Turbulence Modeling for CFD|year=2006|publisher=DCW Industries, Inc.|isbn=978-1-928729-08-2|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zero Equation Model (Cebeci and [[Apollo M. O. Smith|Smith]]).&lt;ref name=wilcox /&gt; The models available in this approach are often referred to by the number of transport equations associated with the method. For example, the Mixing Length model is a "Zero Equation" model because no transport equations are solved; the &lt;math&gt;k-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a "Two Equation" model because two transport equations (one for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and one for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;) are solved.
; [[Reynolds stress model]] (RSM): This approach attempts to actually solve transport equations for the Reynolds stresses. This means introduction of several transport equations for all the Reynolds stresses and hence this approach is much more costly in CPU effort.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

====Large eddy simulation====
{{main article|Large eddy simulation}}

[[Image:LESPremixedFlame.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Volume rendering of a non-premixed swirl flame as simulated by LES.]]
[[Large eddy simulation]] (LES) is a technique in which the smallest scales of the flow are removed through a filtering operation, and their effect modeled using subgrid scale models.  This allows the largest and most important scales of the turbulence to be resolved, while greatly reducing the computational cost incurred by the smallest scales. This method requires greater computational resources than RANS methods, but is far cheaper than DNS.

====Detached eddy simulation====
{{main article|Detached eddy simulation}}

[[Detached eddy simulation]]s (DES) is a modification of a RANS model in which the model switches to a subgrid scale formulation in regions fine enough for LES calculations. Regions near solid boundaries and where the turbulent length scale is less than the maximum grid dimension are assigned the RANS mode of solution. As the turbulent length scale exceeds the grid dimension, the regions are solved using the LES mode. Therefore, the grid resolution for DES is not as demanding as pure LES, thereby considerably cutting down the cost of the computation. Though DES was initially formulated for the Spalart-Allmaras model (Spalart et al., 1997), it can be implemented with other RANS models (Strelets, 2001), by appropriately modifying the length scale which is explicitly or implicitly involved in the RANS model. So while Spalart–Allmaras model based DES acts as LES with a wall model, DES based on other models (like two equation models) behave as a hybrid RANS-LES model. Grid generation is more complicated than for a simple RANS or LES case due to the RANS-LES switch. DES is a non-zonal approach and provides a single smooth velocity field across the RANS and the LES regions of the solutions.

====Direct numerical simulation====
{{main article|Direct numerical simulation}}

[[Direct numerical simulation]] (DNS) resolves the entire range of turbulent length scales.  This marginalizes the effect of models, but is extremely expensive.  The computational cost is proportional to &lt;math&gt;Re^{3}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Pope_2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=Turbulent Flows|author=Pope, S.B.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-59886-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNS is intractable for flows with complex geometries or flow configurations.

====Coherent vortex simulation====

The coherent vortex simulation approach decomposes the turbulent flow field into a coherent part, consisting of organized vortical motion, and the incoherent part, which is the random background flow.&lt;ref name="Farge_2001"&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Coherent Vortex Simulation (CVS), A Semi-Deterministic Turbulence Model Using Wavelets

|pages=393–426
|doi=10.1023/A:1013512726409
|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This decomposition is done using [[wavelet]] filtering.  The approach has much in common with LES, since it uses decomposition and resolves only the filtered portion, but different in that it does not use a linear, low-pass filter.  Instead, the filtering operation is based on wavelets, and the filter can be adapted as the flow field evolves.  [[Marie Farge|Farge]] and Schneider tested the CVS method with two flow configurations and showed that the coherent portion of the flow exhibited the &lt;math&gt;-\frac{40}{39}&lt;/math&gt; energy spectrum exhibited by the total flow, and corresponded to coherent structures ([[vortex stretching|vortex tubes]]), while the incoherent parts of the flow composed homogeneous background noise, which exhibited no organized structures.  Goldstein and Vasilyev&lt;ref name="Goldstein_2004"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied the FDV model to large eddy simulation, but did not assume that the wavelet filter completely eliminated all coherent motions from the subfilter scales.  By employing both LES and CVS filtering, they showed that the SFS dissipation was dominated by the SFS flow field's coherent portion.

====PDF methods====

[[Probability density function]] (PDF) methods for turbulence, first introduced by [[Thomas S. Lundgren|Lundgren]],&lt;ref name="Lundgren_1969"&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Model equation for nonhomogeneous turbulence
|author=Lundgren, T.S.

|doi=10.1063/1.1692511|bibcode = 1969PhFl...12..485L }}&lt;/ref&gt; are based on tracking the one-point PDF of the velocity, &lt;math&gt;f_{V}(\boldsymbol{v};\boldsymbol{x},t) d\boldsymbol{v}&lt;/math&gt;, which gives the probability of the velocity at point &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x}&lt;/math&gt; being between &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v}+d\boldsymbol{v}&lt;/math&gt;.  This approach is analogous to the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases, in which the macroscopic properties of a gas are described by a large number of particles.  PDF methods are unique in that they can be applied in the framework of a number of different turbulence models; the main differences occur in the form of the PDF transport equation.  For example, in the context of [[large eddy simulation]], the PDF becomes the filtered PDF.&lt;ref name="Colucci_1998"&gt;{{cite journal

The PDF is commonly tracked by using Lagrangian particle methods; when combined with large eddy simulation, this leads to a [[Langevin equation]] for subfilter particle evolution.

====Vortex method====
The vortex method is a grid-free technique for the simulation of turbulent flows. It uses vortices as the computational elements, mimicking the physical structures in turbulence. Vortex methods were developed as a grid-free methodology that would not be limited by the fundamental smoothing effects associated with grid-based methods. To be practical, however, vortex methods require means for rapidly computing velocities from the vortex elements – in other words they require the solution to a particular form of the [[N-body problem]] (in which the motion of N objects is tied to their mutual influences). A breakthrough came in the late 1980s with the development of the [[fast multipole method]] (FMM), an algorithm by V. Rokhlin (Yale) and L. Greengard (Courant Institute). This breakthrough paved the way to practical computation of the velocities from the vortex elements and is the basis of successful algorithms.  They are especially well-suited to simulating filamentary motion, such as wisps of smoke, in real-time simulations such as video games, because of the fine detail achieved using minimal computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software based on the vortex method offer a new means for solving tough fluid dynamics problems with minimal user intervention.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  All that is required is specification of problem geometry and setting of boundary and initial conditions. Among the significant advantages of this modern technology;
* It is practically grid-free, thus eliminating numerous iterations associated with RANS and LES.
* All problems are treated identically. No modeling or calibration inputs are required.
* Time-series simulations, which are crucial for correct analysis of acoustics, are possible.
* The small scale and large scale are accurately simulated at the same time.

====Vorticity confinement method====

{{Main article|Vorticity confinement}}

The [[vorticity confinement]] (VC) method is an Eulerian technique used in the simulation of turbulent wakes. It uses a solitary-wave like approach to produce a stable solution with no numerical spreading. VC can capture the small-scale features to within as few as 2 grid cells. Within these features, a nonlinear difference equation is solved as opposed to the [[finite difference equation]]. VC is similar to [[shock capturing methods]], where conservation laws are satisfied, so that the essential integral quantities are accurately computed.

====Linear eddy model====

The Linear eddy model is a technique used to simulate the convective mixing that takes place in turbulent flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krueger|first=Steven K.|title=Linear Eddy Simulations Of Mixing In A Homogeneous Turbulent Flow|journal=Physics of Fluids|year=1993|volume=5|issue=4|pages=1023|bibcode = 1993PhFl....5.1023M |doi = 10.1063/1.858667 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 December 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it provides a mathematical way to describe the interactions of a scalar variable within the vector flow field. It is primarily used in one-dimensional representations of turbulent flow, since it can be applied across a wide range of length scales and Reynolds numbers. This model is generally used as a building block for more complicated flow representations, as it provides high resolution predictions that hold across a large range of flow conditions.

===Two-phase flow===

[[File:Bubble-rising.jpg|thumb|right|Simulation of bubble swarm using [[volume of fluid method]]]]

The modeling of [[two-phase flow]] is still under development. Different methods have been proposed, including the [[Volume of fluid method]], the [[level-set method]] and [[front tracking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hirt|last2=Nichols|first1=C.W.|first2=B.D.|title=Volume of fluid (VOF) method for the dynamics of free boundaries|year=1981|publisher=Journal of Computational Physics }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Unverdi |first1=S.O.|last2=Tryggvason|first2=G.|authorlink2=Gretar Tryggvason|title=A Front-Tracking Method for Viscous, Incompressible, Multi-Fluid Flows|year=1992|publisher=J. Comput. Phys}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These methods often involve a tradeoff between maintaining a sharp interface or conserving mass {{According to whom|date=November 2010}}.  This is crucial since the evaluation of the density, viscosity and surface tension is based on the values averaged over the interface.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Lagrangian multiphase models, which are used for dispersed media, are based on solving the Lagrangian equation of motion for the dispersed phase.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Solution algorithms===

Discretization in the space produces a system of [[ordinary differential equations]] for unsteady problems and algebraic equations for steady problems. Implicit or semi-implicit methods are generally used to integrate the ordinary differential equations, producing a system of (usually) nonlinear algebraic equations.  Applying a [[Newton's method#Nonlinear systems of equations|Newton]] or [[Fixed point iteration|Picard]] iteration produces a system of linear equations which is nonsymmetric in the presence of advection and indefinite in the presence of incompressibility. Such systems, particularly in 3D, are frequently too large for direct solvers, so iterative methods are used, either stationary methods such as [[Successive over-relaxation|successive overrelaxation]] or [[Krylov subspace]] methods. Krylov methods such as [[Generalized minimal residual method|GMRES]], typically used with [[Preconditioner|preconditioning]], operate by minimizing the residual over successive subspaces generated by the preconditioned operator.

[[Multigrid method|Multigrid]] has the advantage of asymptotically optimal performance on many problems. Traditional{{According to whom|date=November 2010}} solvers and preconditioners are effective at reducing high-frequency components of the residual, but low-frequency components typically require many iterations to reduce. By operating on multiple scales, multigrid reduces all components of the residual by similar factors, leading to a mesh-independent number of iterations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

For indefinite systems, preconditioners such as [[incomplete LU factorization]], [[Additive Schwarz method|additive Schwarz]], and [[Multigrid method|multigrid]] perform poorly or fail entirely, so the problem structure must be used for effective preconditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

CFD made a major break through in late 70s with the introduction of LTRAN2, a 2-D code to model oscillating airfoils based on [[transonic]] small perturbation theory by Ballhaus and associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://history.arc.nasa.gov/hist_pdfs/bio_ballhaus.pdf | format = PDF | title = Bioographies | last = Haigh | first = Thomas | work = IEEE Annals of the History of Computing | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a Murman-Cole switch algorithm for modeling the moving shock-waves.&lt;ref&gt;Murman, E.M. and Cole, J.D., "Calculation of Plane Steady Transonic Flows", AIAA Journal , Vol 9, No 1, pp. 114–121, Jan 1971.

===Biomedical engineering===

[[File:Vel-Streamline-FC.jpg|thumb|right|Simulation of blood flow in a human [[aorta]]]]
CFD investigations are used to clarify the characteristics of aortic flow in detail that are otherwise invisible to experimental measurements. To analyze these conditions, CAD models of the human vascular system are extracted employing modern imaging techniques. A 3D model is reconstructed from this data and the fluid flow can be computed. Blood properties like Non-Newtonian behavior and realistic boundary conditions (e.g.  systemic pressure) have to be taken into consideration. Therefore, making it possible to analyze and optimize the flow in the cardiovascular system for different applications.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, T.A.S., Graefe, R., Hormes, M., Schmitz-Rode, T. and Steinseiferand, U., "Computational Fluid Dynamics in Biomedical Engineering", Computational Fluid Dynamics: Theory, Analysis and Applications , pp. 109–136&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CPU versus GPU ===
Traditionally, CFD simulations are performed on CPU's&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=central processing unit|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springerreference_9750|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In a more recent trend, simulations are also performed on GPU's&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Graphics processing unit|date=2018-06-23|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Graphics_processing_unit&amp;oldid=847182694|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These typically contain slower but more processors. For CFD algorithms that feature good parallellisation performance (i.e. good speed-up by adding more cores) this can greatly reduce simulation times. Lattice-Boltzmann methods are a typical example of codes that scale well on GPU's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nvidia.com/content/intersect-360-HPC-application-support.pdf|title=Intersect 360 HPC application Support|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''Cutler's bar notation''' is a [[Mathematical notation|notation system]] for [[large number]]s, introduced by Mark Cutler in 2004.  The idea is based on [[iterated exponentiation]] in much the same way that [[exponentiation]] is [[iteration|iterated]] [[multiplication]].

==Introduction==
A regular [[exponentiation|exponential]] can be expressed as such:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix}
   a^b &amp; = &amp; \underbrace{a_{} \times a \times\dots \times a} \\
   &amp; &amp; b\mbox{ copies of }a
  \end{matrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;

However, these expressions become arbitrarily large when dealing with systems such as [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]].  Take the following:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix}
 &amp; \underbrace{a_{}^{a^{{}^{.\,^{.\,^{.\,^a}}}}}} &amp; 
\\  
&amp; b\mbox{ copies of }a
  \end{matrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;

Cutler's bar notation shifts these exponentials counterclockwise, forming &lt;math&gt;{^b} \bar a&lt;/math&gt;.  A bar is placed above the variable to denote this change.  As such:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix}
 {^b} \bar a = &amp; \underbrace{a_{}^{a^{{}^{.\,^{.\,^{.\,^a}}}}}} &amp; 
\\  
 &amp; b\mbox{ copies of }a
  \end{matrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;

This system becomes effective with multiple exponents, when regular denotation becomes too cumbersome.

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix}
 ^{^b{b}} \bar a = &amp; \underbrace{a_{}^{a^{{}^{.\,^{.\,^{.\,^a}}}}}} &amp; 
\\  
 &amp; {{^b} \bar a}\mbox{ copies of }a
  \end{matrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;

At any time, this can be further shortened by rotating the exponential counterclockwise once more.

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix}
 \underbrace{b_{}^{b^{{}^{.\,^{.\,^{.\,^b}}}}}}  \bar a = {_c} \bar a
\\  
 c \mbox{ copies of } b
  \end{matrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;

The same pattern could be iterated a fourth time, becoming &lt;math&gt;\bar a_{d}&lt;/math&gt;.  For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as '''Cutler's circular notation'''.

==Advantages and drawbacks==

The Cutler bar notation can be used to easily express other notation systems in exponent form.  It also allows for a flexible summarization of multiple copies of the same exponents, where any number of stacked exponents can be shifted counterclockwise and shortened to a single variable.  The bar notation also allows for fairly rapid composure of very large numbers.  For instance, the number &lt;math&gt;\bar {10}_{10}&lt;/math&gt; would contain more than a [[googolplex]] digits, while remaining fairly simple to write with and remember.

However, the system reaches a problem when dealing with different exponents in a single expression.  For instance, the expression &lt;math&gt; ^{a^{b^{b^{c}}}}&lt;/math&gt; could not be summarized in bar notation.  Additionally, the exponent can only be shifted thrice before it returns to its original position, making a five degree shift indistinguishable from a one degree shift.  Some{{Who|date=August 2017}} have suggested using a double and triple bar in subsequent rotations, though this presents problems when dealing with ten- and twenty-degree shifts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5776">The '''Darboux derivative''' of a map between a [[manifold]] and a [[Lie group]] is a variant of the standard derivative. In a certain sense, it is arguably a more natural generalization of the single-variable derivative. It allows a generalization of the single-variable [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] to higher dimensions, in a different vein than the generalization that is [[Stokes' theorem]].

==Formal definition==

Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Lie group]], and let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; be its [[Lie algebra]]. The [[Maurer-Cartan form]], &lt;math&gt;\omega_G&lt;/math&gt;, is the smooth &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;-valued &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-form on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (cf. [[Lie algebra valued form]]) defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_G(X_g) = (T_g L_g)^{-1} X_g &lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;g \in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_g \in T_g G&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;L_g&lt;/math&gt; denotes left multiplication by the element &lt;math&gt;g \in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_g L_g&lt;/math&gt; is its derivative at &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;f:M \to G&lt;/math&gt; be a [[smooth function]] between a [[smooth manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then the '''Darboux derivative''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the smooth &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;-valued &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-form 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_f := f^* \omega_G,&lt;/math&gt;
the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of &lt;math&gt;\omega_G&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. The map &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called an '''integral''' or '''primitive''' of &lt;math&gt;\omega_f&lt;/math&gt;.

==More natural?==

The reason that one might call the Darboux derivative a more natural generalization of the derivative of single-variable calculus is this. In single-variable calculus, the [[derivative]] &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; of a function &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; assigns to each point in the domain a single number. According to the more general manifold ideas of derivatives, the derivative assigns to each point in the domain a [[linear map]] from the tangent space at the domain point to the tangent space at the image point. This derivative encapsulates two pieces of data: the image of the domain point ''and'' the linear map. In single-variable calculus, we drop some information. We retain only the linear map, in the form of a scalar multiplying agent (i.e. a number).

One way to justify this convention of retaining only the linear map aspect of the derivative is to appeal to the (very simple) Lie group structure of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; under addition. The [[tangent bundle]] of any [[Lie group]] can be trivialized via left (or right) multiplication. This means that every tangent space in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; may be identified with the tangent space at the identity, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, which is the [[Lie algebra]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, left and right multiplication are simply translation. By post-composing the manifold-type derivative with the tangent space trivialization, for each point in the domain we obtain a linear map from the tangent space at the domain point to the Lie algebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. In symbols, for each &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; we look at the map
:&lt;math&gt;v \in T_x \mathbb{R} \mapsto (T_{f(x)} L_{f(x)})^{-1} \circ (T_x f) v \in T_0 \mathbb{R}.&lt;/math&gt;
Since the tangent spaces involved are one-dimensional, this linear map is just multiplication by some scalar. (This scalar can change depending on what basis we use for the vector spaces, but the [[Canonical units|canonical unit]] vector field &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; gives a canonical choice of basis, and hence a canonical choice of scalar.) This scalar is what we usually denote by &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Uniqueness of primitives==

If the manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is connected, and &lt;math&gt;f,g: M \to G&lt;/math&gt; are both primitives of &lt;math&gt;\omega_f&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\omega_f = \omega_g&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists some constant &lt;math&gt;C \in G&lt;/math&gt; such that 
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = C \cdot g(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in M&lt;/math&gt;.

This constant &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is of course the analogue of the constant that appears when taking an [[indefinite integral]].

==The fundamental theorem of calculus==

Recall the '''structural equation''' for the [[Maurer-Cartan form]]:
:&lt;math&gt;d \omega + \frac{1}{2} [\omega, \omega] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
This means that for all vector fields &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;x \in G&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;(d \omega)_x (X_x, Y_x) +  [\omega_x(X_x), \omega_x(Y_x)] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
For any Lie algebra-valued &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-form on any smooth manifold, all the terms in this equation make sense, so for any such form we can ask whether or not it satisfies this structural equation.

The usual [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] for single-variable calculus has the following local generalization.

If a &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;-valued &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the structural equation, then every point &lt;math&gt;p \in M&lt;/math&gt; has an open neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and a smooth map &lt;math&gt;f: U \to G&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_f = \omega|_U,&lt;/math&gt;
i.e. &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; has a primitive defined in a neighborhood of every point of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

For a global generalization of the fundamental theorem, one needs to study certain [[monodromy]] questions in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Calculus |Integral}}
'''Disc integration''', also known in [[integral calculus]] as the '''disc method''', is a means of calculating the [[volume]] of a [[solid of revolution]] of a solid-state material when [[Integral|integrating]] along an axis "parallel" to the [[axis of revolution]]. This method models the resulting three-dimensional shape as a stack of an infinite number of discs of varying radius and infinitesimal thickness. It is also possible to use the same principles with rings instead of discs (the "'''washer method'''") to obtain hollow solids of revolutions. This is in contrast to [[shell integration]] which integrates along an axis ''perpendicular'' to the axis of revolution.

==Definition==
===Function of {{mvar|x}}===
If the function to be revolved is a function of {{mvar|x}}, the following integral represents the volume of the solid of revolution:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi\int_a^b R(x)^2\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''R''(''x'')}} is the distance between the function and the axis of rotation. This works only if the [[axis of rotation]] is horizontal (example: {{math|''y'' {{=}} 3}} or some other constant).

===Function of {{mvar|y}}===
If the function to be revolved is a function of {{mvar|y}}, the following integral will obtain the volume of the solid of revolution:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi\int_c^d R(y)^2\,dy&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''R''(''y'')}} is the distance between the function and the axis of rotation. This works only if the [[axis of rotation]] is vertical (example: {{math|''x'' {{=}} 4}} or some other constant).

===Washer method===
To obtain a hollow solid of revolution (the “washer method”), the procedure would be to take the volume of the inner solid of revolution and subtract it from the volume of the outer solid of revolution. This can be calculated in a single integral similar to the following: 

:&lt;math&gt;\pi\int_a^b\left(R_\mathrm{O}(x)^2 - R_\mathrm{I}(x)^2\right)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} is the function that is farthest from the axis of rotation and {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} is the function that is closest to the axis of rotation. One should take caution not to evaluate the square of the difference of the two functions, but to evaluate the difference of the squares of the two functions.

:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{O}(x)^2 - R_\mathrm{I}(x)^2 \not\equiv \left(R_\mathrm{O}(x) - R_\mathrm{I}(x)\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

(This formula only works for revolutions about the {{mvar|x}}-axis.)

To rotate about any horizontal axis, simply subtract from that axis each formula. If {{mvar|h}} is the value of a horizontal axis, then the volume equals

:&lt;math&gt;\pi\int_a^b\left(\left(h-R_\mathrm{O}(x)\right)^2 - \left(h-R_\mathrm{I}(x)\right)^2\right)\,dx\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, to rotate the region between {{math|''y'' {{=}} −2''x'' + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''}} along the axis {{math|''y'' {{=}} 4}}, one would integrate as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi\int_0^3\left(\left(4-\left(-2x+x^2\right)\right)^2 - (4-x)^2\right)\,dx\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The bounds of integration are the zeros of the first equation minus the second. Note that when integrating along an axis other than the {{mvar|x}}, the graph of the function that is farthest from the axis of rotation may not be that obvious. In the previous example, even though the graph of {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''}} is, with respect to the x-axis, further up than the graph of {{math|''y'' {{=}} −2''x'' + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, with respect to the axis of rotation the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''}} is the inner function: its graph is closer to {{math|''y'' {{=}} 4}} or the equation of the axis of rotation in the example.

The same idea can be applied to both the {{mvar|y}}-axis and any other vertical axis. One simply must solve each equation for {{mvar|x}} before one inserts them into the integration formula.

{{Calculus|Vector}}

In [[vector calculus]], '''divergence''' is a [[vector operator]] that produces a [[scalar field]], giving the quantity of a [[vector field]]'s [[Current sources and sinks|source]] at each point. More technically, the divergence represents the volume density of the outward [[flux]] of a vector field from an infinitesimal volume around a given point.

As an example, consider air as it is heated or cooled. The [[velocity]] of the air at each point defines a vector field. While air is heated in a region, it expands in all directions, and thus the velocity field points outward from that region. The divergence of the velocity field in that region would thus have a positive value. While the air is cooled and thus contracting, the divergence of the velocity has a negative value.

== Physical interpretation of divergence ==

In physical terms, the divergence of a three-dimensional vector field is the extent to which the vector field flow behaves like a source at a given point. It is a local measure of its "outgoingness" – the extent to which there is more of some quantity exiting an infinitesimal region of space than entering it. If the divergence is nonzero at some point then there is compression or expansion at that point. (Note that we are imagining the vector field to be like the velocity vector field of a fluid (in motion) when we use the terms ''flow'' and so on.)

More rigorously, the divergence of a vector field {{math|'''F'''}} at a point {{math|''p''}} can be defined as the limit of the net flow of {{math|'''F'''}} across the smooth boundary of a three-dimensional region {{math|''V''}} divided by the volume of {{math|''V''}} as {{math|''V''}} shrinks to {{math|''p''}}. Formally,

:&lt;math&gt;\left. \operatorname{div} \mathbf{F} \right|_p = \lim_{V \rightarrow \{p\}} \iint_{S(V)} \frac{\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{\hat n}}{|V|} \, dS,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|{{abs|''V''}}}} is the volume of {{math|''V''}}, {{math|''S''(''V'')}} is the boundary of {{math|''V''}}, and the integral is a [[surface integral]] with {{math|'''n̂'''}} being the outward unit normal to that surface. The result, {{math|div '''F'''}}, is a function of {{math|''p''}}. From this definition it also becomes obvious that {{math|div '''F'''}} can be seen as the ''source density'' of the flux of {{math|'''F'''}}.

In light of the physical interpretation, a vector field with zero divergence everywhere is called ''incompressible'' or ''[[solenoidal vector field|solenoidal]]'' – in which case any closed surface has no net flow across it.

The intuition that the sum of all sources minus the sum of all sinks should give the net flow outwards of a region is made precise by the [[divergence theorem]].

== Definition  ==
===Cartesian coordinates===

Let {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}}, {{math|''z''}} be a system of [[Cartesian coordinates]] in 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], and let {{math|'''i'''}}, {{math|'''j'''}}, {{math|'''k'''}} be the corresponding [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of [[unit vector]]s. The divergence of a [[continuously differentiable]] [[vector field]] {{math|1='''F''' = ''U'''''i''' + ''V'''''j''' + ''W'''''k'''}} is defined as the [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]-valued function:{{sfn|Rudin|1976|loc=p. 281}}{{sfn|Edwards|1994|loc=p. 309}}

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div} \mathbf{F} = \nabla\cdot\mathbf{F} = \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \right) \cdot (U,V,W) = \frac{\partial U}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial V}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial W}{\partial z}.&lt;/math&gt;

Although expressed in terms of coordinates, the result is invariant under [[Rotation matrix|rotations]], as the physical interpretation suggests. This is because the trace of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian matrix]] of an {{math|''N''}}-dimensional vector field {{math|'''F'''}} in {{math|''N''}}-dimensional space is invariant under any invertible linear transformation.

The common notation for the divergence {{math|∇ · '''F'''}} is a convenient mnemonic, where the dot denotes an operation reminiscent of the [[dot product]]: take the components of the {{math|∇}} operator (see [[del]]), apply them to the corresponding components of {{math|'''F'''}}, and sum the results. Because applying an operator is different from multiplying the components, this is considered an [[abuse of notation]].

The divergence of a continuously differentiable second-order [[tensor field]] {{math|'''''ε'''''}} is a first-order tensor field:{{sfn|Gurtin|1981|loc=p. 30}}

:&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{\operatorname{div}} (\mathbf{\varepsilon}) = \begin{bmatrix}
\dfrac{\partial \varepsilon_{xx}}{\partial x} +\dfrac{\partial \varepsilon_{yx}}{\partial y} +\dfrac{\partial \varepsilon_{zx}}{\partial z} \\
\dfrac{\partial \varepsilon_{xy}}{\partial x} +\dfrac{\partial \varepsilon_{yy}}{\partial y} +\dfrac{\partial \varepsilon_{zy}}{\partial z} \\
\dfrac{\partial \varepsilon_{xz}}{\partial x} +\dfrac{\partial \varepsilon_{yz}}{\partial y} +\dfrac{\partial \varepsilon_{zz}}{\partial z}
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Cylindrical coordinates ===
For a vector expressed in '''local''' unit cylindrical coordinates as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{e}_r F_r + \mathbf{e}_\theta F_\theta + \mathbf{e}_z F_z,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the unit vector in direction {{math|''a''}}, the divergence is{{refn|[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CylindricalCoordinates.html Cylindrical coordinates] at Wolfram Mathworld}}
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div} \mathbf F = \nabla\cdot\mathbf F = \frac1r \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(rF_r\right) + \frac1r \frac{\partial F_\theta}{\partial\theta} + \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial z}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The use of local coordinates is vital for the validity of the expression. If we consider {{math|'''x'''}} the position vector and the functions &lt;math&gt;r(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;, which assign the corresponding '''global''' cylindrical coordinate to a vector, in general &lt;math&gt;r(\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}))\neq F_r(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta(\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}))\neq F_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z(\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}))\neq F_z(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, if we consider the identity function  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x})= \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;, we find that:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta(\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x})) = \theta \neq F_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Spherical coordinates ===
In [[spherical coordinates]], with {{math|''θ''}} the angle with the {{math|''z''}} axis and {{math|''φ''}} the rotation around the {{math|''z''}} axis, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; again written in local unit coordinates, the divergence is{{refn|[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCoordinates.html Spherical coordinates] at Wolfram Mathworld}}
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div}\mathbf{F} = \nabla\cdot\mathbf F = \frac1{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^2 F_r\right) + \frac1{r\sin\theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} (\sin\theta\, F_\theta) + \frac1{r\sin\theta} \frac{\partial F_\varphi}{\partial \varphi}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== General coordinates ===
Using [[Einstein notation]] we can consider the divergence in [[Curvilinear_coordinates| general coordinates]], which we write as {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;, ...,''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{mvar|n}} is the number of dimensions of the domain. Here, the upper index refers to the number of the coordinate or component, so {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} refers to the second component, and not the quantity {{math|''x''}} squared. The index variable {{math|''i''}} is used to refer to an arbitrary element, such as {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The divergence can then be written via the [https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=59087 Voss]-[[Hermann_Weyl| Weyl]] formula&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grinfeld|first1=Pavel|title=The Voss-Weyl Formula|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD2AiFk651E&amp;list=PLlXfTHzgMRULkodlIEqfgTS-H1AY_bNtq&amp;index=23|accessdate=9 January 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div}(\mathbf{F}) = \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \left(\rho\, F^i\right)}{\partial x^i},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the local coefficient of the [[volume element]] and {{math|''F''{{sup|''i''}} }} are the components of {{math|'''F'''}} with respect to the local '''unnormalized''' [[Curvilinear_coordinates#Covariant and contravariant bases|covariant basis]] (sometimes written as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i  = \partial\mathbf{x} / \partial x^i&lt;/math&gt;). The Einstein notation implies summation over {{math|''i''}}, since it appears as both an upper and lower index.

The volume coefficient &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a function of position which depends on the coordinate system. In Cartesian, cylindrical and polar coordinates, &lt;math&gt;\rho=1, r,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r^2\sin{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; respectively, using the same conventions as above. It can also be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\rho=\sqrt{\operatorname{det}g_{ab}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[metric tensor]]. Since the determinant is a scalar quantity which doesn't depend on the indices, we can suppress them and simply write &lt;math&gt;\rho=\sqrt{\operatorname{det}g}&lt;/math&gt;. Another expression comes from computing the determinant of the Jacobian for transforming from Cartesian coordinates, which for {{math|1=''n'' = 3}} gives &lt;math&gt;\rho=\left |\frac{\partial(x,y,z)}{\partial (x^1,x^2,x^3)}\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

Some conventions expect all local basis elements to be normalized to unit length, as was done in the previous sections. If we write &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{e}}_i&lt;/math&gt; for the normalized basis, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{F}^i&lt;/math&gt; for the components of {{math|'''F'''}} with respect to it, we have that 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=F^i \mathbf{e}_i =
F^i {\lVert{\mathbf{e}_i }\rVert } \frac{\mathbf{e}_i}{\lVert{\mathbf{e}_i }\rVert} =
F^i {\sqrt{g_{ii}}} \, \hat{\mathbf{e}}_i =
\hat{F}^i \hat{\mathbf{e}}_i,&lt;/math&gt;
using one of the properties of the metric tensor. By dotting both sides of the last equality with the contravariant element &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{e}}^i&lt;/math&gt;, we can conclude that &lt;math&gt;F^i = \hat{F}^i / \sqrt{g_{ii}}&lt;/math&gt;. After substituting, the formula becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div}(\mathbf{F}) = \frac1{\rho} \frac{\partial \left(\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{g_{ii}}}\hat{F}^i\right)}{\partial x^i} =
 \frac1{\sqrt{\operatorname{det}g}} \frac{\partial \left(\sqrt{\frac{\operatorname{det}g}{g_{ii}}}\,\hat{F}^i\right)}{\partial x^i}
&lt;/math&gt;.

See ''{{section link||Generalizations}}'' for further discussion.

== Decomposition theorem==
{{main|Helmholtz decomposition}}
It can be shown that any stationary flux {{math|'''v'''('''r''')}} that is at least twice continuously differentiable in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and vanishes sufficiently fast for {{math|{{abs|'''r'''}} → ∞}} can be decomposed into an ''irrotational part'' {{math|'''E'''('''r''')}} and a ''source-free part'' {{math|'''B'''('''r''')}}. Moreover, these parts are explicitly determined by the respective ''source densities'' (see above) and ''circulation densities'' (see the article [[Curl (mathematics)|Curl]]):

For the irrotational part one has

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E=-\nabla \Phi(\mathbf r),&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi (\mathbf{r})=\int_{\mathbb R^3}\,d^3\mathbf r'\;\frac{\operatorname{div} \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{r}')}{4\pi\left|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'\right|}.&lt;/math&gt;

The source-free part, {{math|'''B'''}}, can be similarly written: one only has to replace the ''scalar potential'' {{math|Φ('''r''')}} by a ''vector potential'' {{math|'''A'''('''r''')}} and the terms {{math|−∇Φ}} by {{math|+∇ × '''A'''}}, and the source density {{math|div '''v'''}}
by the circulation density {{math|∇ × '''v'''}}.

This "decomposition theorem" is a by-product of the stationary case of [[electrodynamics]]. It is a special case of the more general [[Helmholtz decomposition]] which works in dimensions greater than three as well.

== Properties ==
{{main|Vector calculus identities}}

The following properties can all be derived from the ordinary differentiation rules of [[calculus]]. Most importantly, the divergence is a [[linear operator]], i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div}( a\mathbf{F} + b\mathbf{G} ) = a \operatorname{div} \mathbf{F} + b \operatorname{div} \mathbf{G}&lt;/math&gt;

for all vector fields {{math|'''F'''}} and {{math|'''G'''}} and all [[real number]]s {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}.

There is a [[product rule]] of the following type: if {{mvar|φ}} is a scalar-valued function and {{math|'''F'''}} is a vector field, then

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div}(\varphi \mathbf{F}) = \operatorname{grad} \varphi \cdot \mathbf{F} + \varphi \operatorname{div} \mathbf{F},&lt;/math&gt;

or in more suggestive notation

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot(\varphi \mathbf{F}) = (\nabla\varphi) \cdot \mathbf{F} + \varphi (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{F}).&lt;/math&gt;

Another product rule for the [[cross product]] of two vector fields {{math|'''F'''}} and {{math|'''G'''}} in three dimensions involves the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] and reads as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div}(\mathbf{F}\times\mathbf{G}) = \operatorname{curl} \mathbf{F} \cdot\mathbf{G} - \mathbf{F} \cdot \operatorname{curl} \mathbf{G},&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot(\mathbf{F}\times\mathbf{G}) = (\nabla\times\mathbf{F})\cdot\mathbf{G} - \mathbf{F}\cdot(\nabla\times\mathbf{G}).&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Laplacian]] of a [[scalar field]] is the divergence of the field's gradient:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div}(\nabla\varphi) = \Delta\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

The divergence of the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of any vector field (in three dimensions) is equal to zero: 
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot(\nabla\times\mathbf{F})=0.&lt;/math&gt;

If a vector field {{math|'''F'''}} with zero divergence is defined on a ball in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then there exists some vector field {{math|'''G'''}} on the ball with {{math|'''F''' {{=}} curl '''G'''}}. For regions in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} more topologically complicated than this, the latter statement might be false (see [[Poincaré lemma]]). The degree of ''failure'' of the truth of the statement, measured by the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] of the [[chain complex]]

:&lt;math&gt;\{ \text{scalar fields on } U \} ~ \overset{\operatorname{grad}}{\rarr} ~ \{ \text{vector fields on } U \} ~ \overset{\operatorname{curl}}{\rarr} ~ \{ \text{vector fields on } U \} ~ \overset{\operatorname{div}}{\rarr} ~ \{ \text{scalar fields on } U \}&lt;/math&gt;

serves as a nice quantification of the complicatedness of the underlying region {{math|''U''}}. These are the beginnings and main motivations of [[de Rham cohomology]].

==Relation with the exterior derivative==
One can express the divergence as a particular case of the exterior derivative, which takes a 2-form to a 3-form in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Define the current two-form as
:&lt;math&gt;j = F_1 \, dy \wedge dz + F_2 \, dz \wedge dx + F_3 \, dx \wedge dy .&lt;/math&gt;
It measures the amount of "stuff" flowing through a surface per unit time in a "stuff fluid" of density {{math|''ρ'' {{=}} 1 ''dx'' ∧ ''dy'' ∧ ''dz''}} moving with local velocity {{math|'''F'''}}. Its [[exterior derivative]] {{math|''dj''}} is then given by
:&lt;math&gt;dj = \left( \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x} +\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial y} +\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial z} \right) dx \wedge dy \wedge dz = ( \nabla \cdot {\mathbf F} ) \rho .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the divergence of the vector field {{math|'''F'''}} can be expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot {\mathbf F} = {\star} d{\star} \big( {\mathbf F}^\flat \big) .&lt;/math&gt;
Here the superscript {{music|flat}} is one of the two [[musical isomorphism]]s, and {{math|⋆}} is the [[Hodge star operator]]. Working with the current two-form and the exterior derivative is usually easier than working with the vector field and divergence, because unlike the divergence, the exterior derivative commutes with a change of (curvilinear) coordinate system.

==Generalizations==

The divergence of a vector field can be defined in any number of dimensions. If 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = ( F_1 , F_2 , \ldots F_n ) ,&lt;/math&gt;

in a Euclidean coordinate system with coordinates {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, define

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div} \mathbf{F} = \nabla\cdot\mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x_1} + \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x_2} + \cdots + \frac{\partial F_n}{\partial x_n}.&lt;/math&gt;
The appropriate expression is more complicated in [[Curvilinear coordinates#Grad, curl, div, Laplacian|curvilinear coordinates]].

In the case of one dimension, {{math|'''F'''}} reduces to a regular function, and the divergence reduces to the derivative.

For any {{math|''n''}}, the divergence is a linear operator, and it satisfies the "product rule"

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot(\varphi \mathbf{F}) = (\nabla\varphi) \cdot \mathbf{F} + \varphi (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{F})&lt;/math&gt;

for any scalar-valued function {{mvar|φ}}.

The divergence of a vector field extends naturally to any [[differentiable manifold]] of dimension {{math|''n''}} that has a [[volume form]] (or [[density on a manifold|density]]) {{mvar|μ}}, e.g. a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] or [[Lorentzian manifold]]. Generalising the construction of a two-form for a vector field on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, on such a manifold a vector field {{math|''X''}} defines an {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-form {{math|''j'' {{=}} ''i&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;μ''}} obtained by contracting {{math|''X''}} with {{mvar|μ}}. The divergence is then the function defined by

:&lt;math&gt;dj = ( \operatorname{div} X ) \mu .&lt;/math&gt;

Standard formulas for the [[Lie derivative]] allow us to reformulate this as

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal L}_X \mu = ( \operatorname{div} X ) \mu .&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the divergence measures the rate of expansion of a volume element as we let it flow with the vector field.

On a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], the divergence with respect to the metric volume form can be computed in terms of the [[Levi-Civita connection]] {{math|∇}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div} X = \nabla \cdot X = {X^a}_{;a} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the second expression is the contraction of the vector field valued 1-form {{math|∇''X''}} with itself and the last expression is the traditional coordinate expression from [[Ricci calculus]].

An equivalent expression without using connection is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div}(X) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\operatorname{det} g}} \partial_a \left(\sqrt{\operatorname{det} g} \, X^a\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|g}} is the metric and {{math|∂{{sub|''a''}}}} denotes the partial derivative with respect to coordinate {{math|''x''{{i sup|''a''}}}}.

Divergence can also be generalised to [[tensors]]. In [[Einstein notation]], the divergence of a [[contravariant vector]] {{mvar|F{{isup|μ}}}} is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \nabla_\mu F^\mu ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} denotes the [[covariant derivative]].

Equivalently, some authors define the divergence of a [[mixed tensor]] by using the [[musical isomorphism]] {{music|sharp}}: if {{math|''T''}} is a {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}}-[[tensor]] ({{math|''p''}} for the contravariant vector and {{math|''q''}} for the covariant one), then we define the ''divergence of {{mvar|T}}'' to be the {{math|(''p'', ''q'' − 1)}}-tensor

:&lt;math&gt;( \operatorname{div} T ) ( Y_1 , \ldots , Y_{q-1}) = {\operatorname{trace}} \Big( X \mapsto \sharp ( \nabla T ) ( X , \cdot , Y_1 , \ldots , Y_{q-1} ) \Big);&lt;/math&gt;

that is, we take the trace over the ''first two'' covariant indices of the covariant derivative{{efn| The choice of "first" covariant index of a tensor is intrinsic and depends on the ordering of the terms of the Cartesian product of vector spaces on which the tensor is given as a multilinear map {{math|V × V × ... × V → '''R'''}}. But equally well defined choices for the divergence could be made by using other indices. Consequently, it is more natural to specify the divergence of {{math|''T''}} with respect to a specified index. There are however two important special cases where this choice is essentially irrelevant: with a totally symmetric contravariant tensor, when every choice is equivalent, and with a totally antisymmetric contravariant tensor ({{aka}} a ''k''-vector), when the choice affects only the sign.}}

[[File:PenduleEspaceDesPhases.png|thumb|Flow in [[phase space]] specified by the differential equation of a [[pendulum]]. On the x axis, the pendulum position, and on the y one its speed.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''flow''' formalizes the idea of the motion of particles in a fluid.  Flows are ubiquitous in science, including [[engineering]] and [[physics]]. The notion of flow is basic to the study of [[ordinary differential equation]]s. Informally, a flow may be viewed as a continuous motion of points over time. More formally, a flow is a [[group action]] of the [[real number]]s on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]].

The idea of a [[vector flow]], that is, the flow determined by a [[vector field]], occurs in the areas of [[differential topology]], [[Riemannian geometry]] and [[Lie group]]s. Specific examples of vector flows include the [[geodesic flow]], the [[Hamiltonian flow]], the [[Ricci flow]], the [[mean curvature flow]], and the [[Anosov flow]].  Flows may also be defined for systems of [[random variable]]s and [[stochastic process]]es, and occur in the study of [[ergodic]] [[dynamical system]]s.  The most celebrated of these is perhaps the [[Bernoulli flow]].

==Formal definition==
A '''flow''' on a set {{mvar|X}} is a [[group action]] of the [[additive group]] of [[real number]]s on  {{mvar|X}}. More explicitly, a flow is a [[function (mathematics)|mapping]]
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi:X\times \R\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;
such that, for all {{mvar|x}} ∈ {{mvar|X}} and all real numbers  {{mvar|s}} and {{mvar|t}},
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(x,0) = x;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(\varphi(x,t),s) = \varphi(x,s+t).&lt;/math&gt;

It is customary to write {{math|''φ''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} instead of {{math|''φ''(''x'', ''t'')}}, so that the equations above can be expressed as {{nowrap|1=''&amp;phi;''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = Id}} ([[identity function]]) and {{nowrap|1=''&amp;phi;''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ ''&amp;phi;''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''&amp;phi;''&lt;sup&gt;''s''+''t''&lt;/sup&gt;}} (group law). Then, for all {{nowrap|''t'' &amp;isin; ℝ}}, the mapping {{nowrap|''&amp;phi;''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;: ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''X''}} is a bijection with inverse {{nowrap|''&amp;phi;''&lt;sup&gt;''−t''&lt;/sup&gt;: ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''X''}}. This follows from the above definition, and the real parameter {{mvar|t}}  may be taken as a generalized [[functional power]], as in [[function iteration]].

Flows are usually required to be compatible with [[mathematical structure|structure]]s furnished on the set {{mvar|X}}.  In particular, if {{mvar|X}}  is equipped with a [[topological space|topology]], then {{mvar|φ}} is usually required to be [[continuous function|continuous]]. If {{mvar|X}}  is equipped with a [[differentiable manifold|differentiable structure]], then {{mvar|φ}} is usually required to be [[differentiable function|differentiable]]. In these cases the flow forms a [[one-parameter group|one parameter subgroup]] of homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms, respectively.

In certain situations one might also consider '''local flows''', which are defined only in some subset
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{dom}(\varphi) = \{ (x,t) \ | \ t\in[a_x,b_x], \ a_x&lt;0&lt;b_x, \ x\in X \} \subset X\times\mathbb R &lt;/math&gt;
called the '''flow domain''' of {{mvar|φ}}. This is often the case with the [[Vector field#Flow curves|flows of vector fields]].

=== Alternative notations ===
It is very common in many fields, including [[engineering]], [[physics]] and  the study of [[differential equation]]s, to use a notation that makes the flow implicit.  Thus, {{math|''x''(''t'')}} is written for {{math|''φ''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and one might say that the "variable {{mvar|x}} depends on the time {{mvar|t}} and the initial condition {{math|1= ''x'' = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}". Examples are given below.

In the case of a [[Vector field#Flow curves|flow of a vector field]] {{mvar|V}} on a [[smooth manifold]] {{mvar|X}}, the flow is often denoted in such a way that its generator is made explicit. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_V:X\times\mathbb R\to X; \qquad (x,t)\mapsto\Phi_V^t(x).&lt;/math&gt;

== Orbits ==
Given {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}}, the set &lt;math&gt; \{ \varphi(x,t) : t \in \mathbb{R} \} &lt;/math&gt; is called the [[Orbit (dynamics)|orbit]] of {{mvar|x}} under {{mvar|φ}}. Informally, it may be regarded as the trajectory of a particle that was initially positioned at {{mvar|x}}. If the flow is generated by a [[vector field]], then its orbits are the images of its [[integral curve]]s.

== Examples ==

=== Autonomous systems of ordinary differential equations ===
Let {{math|'''''F''''': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;→'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} be a (time-independent) vector field
and {{math|'''''x''''': '''R'''→'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} the solution of the initial value problem
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\boldsymbol{x}}(t) = \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{x}(t)), \qquad \boldsymbol{x}(0)=\boldsymbol{x}_0.&lt;/math&gt;

Then {{math|''φ''('''''x'''''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''t'') {{=}} '''''x'''''(''t'')}} is the '''flow of the vector field ''F'''''. It is a well-defined local flow provided that the vector field 
{{math|'''''F''''': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is [[Lipschitz-continuous]]. Then {{math|''&amp;phi;'': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;×'''R''' &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is also Lipschitz-continuous wherever defined. In general it may be hard to show that the flow {{mvar|φ}} is globally defined, but one simple criterion is that the vector field '''''F''''' is [[compactly supported]].

=== Time-dependent ordinary differential equations ===
In the case of time-dependent vector fields {{math|'''''F''''': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;×'''R'''→'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, one denotes {{math|''φ''&lt;sup&gt;''t'',''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;('''''x'''''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} '''''x'''''(''t'')}}, where {{math|'''''x''''': '''R'''→'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the solution of
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\boldsymbol{x}}(t) = \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{x}(t),t), \qquad \boldsymbol{x}(t_0)=\boldsymbol{x}_0.&lt;/math&gt;
Then {{math|''φ''&lt;sup&gt;t,t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;('''x'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''t'',''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is the '''time-dependent flow of ''F'''''. It is not a "flow" by the definition above, but it can easily be seen as one by rearranging its arguments. Namely, the mapping
:&lt;math&gt; \varphi:(\mathbb R^n\times\mathbb R)\times\mathbb R \to \mathbb R^n\times\mathbb R; \qquad
\varphi(\boldsymbol{x}_0, t_0, t)=(\varphi^{t,t_0}(\boldsymbol{x}_0),t+t_0)&lt;/math&gt;
indeed satisfies the group law for the last variable:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(\varphi(\boldsymbol{x}_0,t_0,t),s) = \varphi(\varphi^{t,t_0}(\boldsymbol{x}_0),t+t_0,s)
= (\varphi^{s,t+t_0}(\boldsymbol{x}_0),s+t+t_0) =\varphi(\boldsymbol{x}_0,t_0,s+t).&lt;/math&gt;
One can see time-dependent flows of vector fields as special cases of time-independent ones by the following trick. Define
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{G}(\boldsymbol{x},t):=(\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{x},t),1), \qquad \boldsymbol{y}(t) :=(\boldsymbol{x}(t),t+t_0).&lt;/math&gt;
Then '''''y'''''(''t'') is the solution of the "time-independent" initial value problem
:&lt;math&gt; \dot{\boldsymbol{y}}(s) = \boldsymbol{G}(\boldsymbol{y}(s)), \qquad \boldsymbol{y}(0)=(\boldsymbol{x}_0,t_0)&lt;/math&gt;
if and only if {{math|'''''x'''''(''t'')}} is the solution of the original time-dependent initial value problem. Furthermore, then the mapping {{mvar|φ}} is exactly the flow of the "time-independent" vector field '''''G'''''.

=== Flows of vector fields on manifolds ===
The flows of time-independent and time-dependent vector fields are defined on smooth manifolds exactly as they are defined on the Euclidean space {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and their local behavior is the same. However, the global topological structure of a smooth manifold is strongly manifest in what kind of global vector fields it can support, and flows of vector fields on smooth manifolds are indeed an important tool in differential topology. The bulk of studies in dynamical systems are conducted on smooth manifolds, which are thought of as "parameter spaces" in applications.

=== Solutions of heat equation ===
Let {{mvar|Ω}} be a subdomain (bounded or not) of ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (with {{mvar|n}} an integer). Denote by {{mvar|Γ}} its boundary (assumed smooth). 
Consider the following [[Heat equation|Heat Equation]] on  {{mvar|Ω}}  × (0,{{mvar|T}}),  for {{mvar|T}} &gt; 0,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcll}
u_t - \Delta u &amp; = &amp; 0 &amp; \mbox{ in } \Omega \times (0,T), \\
u &amp; = &amp; 0 &amp; \mbox{ on } \Gamma \times (0,T),
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
with the following initial boundary condition {{math| ''u''(0) {{=}} ''u''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} in {{mvar|Ω}} .

The equation  {{mvar|u}} = 0 on {{math| ''Γ'' × (0,''T'')}} corresponds to the Homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. The mathematical setting for this problem can be the semigroup approach. To use this tool, we introduce the unbounded operator  {{math|''Δ&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''}}  defined on &lt;math&gt;L^2(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; by its domain
:&lt;math&gt; D(\Delta_D) = H^2(\Omega) \cap H_0^1(\Omega) &lt;/math&gt; 
(see the classical [[Sobolev space#Sobolev spaces with integer k|Sobolev spaces]] with &lt;math&gt; H^k(\Omega) = W^{k,2}(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; 
and 
:&lt;math&gt;H_0^1(\Omega) = {\overline{C_0^\infty (\Omega)} } ^{H^1(\Omega)}&lt;/math&gt; 
is the closure of the infinitely differentiable functions with compact support in {{mvar|Ω}} for the &lt;math&gt; H^1(\Omega)-&lt;/math&gt;norm). 

For any &lt;math&gt; v \in D(\Delta_D) &lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta_D v = \Delta v = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial^2 }{\partial x_i^2} v ~. 
&lt;/math&gt;

With this operator, the heat equation becomes &lt;math&gt; u'(t) = \Delta_Du(t) &lt;/math&gt; and  {{math| ''u''(0) {{=}} ''u''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Thus, the flow corresponding to this equation is (see notations above)
:&lt;math&gt;
\varphi(u^0,t) = \mbox{e}^{t\Delta_D}u^0&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|exp(''tΔ&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}  is the (analytic) semigroup generated by {{math|''Δ&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

=== Solutions of wave equation ===
Again, let {{mvar|Ω}} be a subdomain (bounded or not) of ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (with {{mvar|n}} an integer). We denote by {{mvar|Γ}} its boundary (assumed smooth). 
Consider the following [[Wave equation|Wave Equation]] on &lt;math&gt; \Omega \times (0,T) &lt;/math&gt; (for {{mvar|T}} &gt; 0),
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcll}
u_{tt} - \Delta u &amp; = &amp; 0 &amp; \mbox{ in } \Omega \times (0,T), \\
u &amp; = &amp; 0 &amp; \mbox{ on } \Gamma \times (0,T),
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
with the following initial condition  {{math| ''u''(0) {{=}} ''u''&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt;}} in  &lt;math&gt; \Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; u_t(0) = u^{2,0} \mbox{ in } \Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

Using the same semigroup approach as in the case of the Heat Equation above. We write the wave equation as a first order in time partial differential equation by introducing the following unbounded operator,
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{A} = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; Id \\ \Delta_D &amp; 0 \end{array}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
with domain &lt;math&gt; D(\mathcal{A}) = H^2(\Omega) \cap H_0^1(\Omega) \times H_0^1(\Omega) &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; H = H^1_0(\Omega) \times L^2(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; (the operator &lt;math&gt; \Delta_D&lt;/math&gt; is defined in the previous example). 

We introduce the column vectors  
:&lt;math&gt; U = \left(\begin{array}{c} u^1 \\ u^2 \end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt; 
(where &lt;math&gt; u^1 = u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; u^2 = u_t&lt;/math&gt;) and 
:&lt;math&gt; U^0 = \left(\begin{array}{c} u^{1,0} \\ u^{2,0} \end{array} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

With these notions, the Wave Equation becomes &lt;math&gt; U'(t) = \mathcal{A}U(t) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; U(0) = U^0 &lt;/math&gt;. 

Thus, the flow corresponding to this equation is 
&lt;math&gt;
\varphi(U^0,t) = \mbox{e}^{t\mathcal{A}}U^0
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mbox{e}^{t\mathcal{A}}&lt;/math&gt; is the (unitary) semigroup generated by &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Bernoulli flow ===
[[Ergodic]] [[dynamical system]]s, that is, systems exhibiting randomness, exhibit  flows as well.  The most celebrated of these is perhaps the [[Bernoulli flow]].  The [[Ornstein isomorphism theorem]] states that, for any given [[Kolmogorov entropy|entropy]] {{mvar|H}}, there exists a flow {{math| ''φ''(''x,t'')}}, called the Bernoulli flow, such that the flow at time {{mvar|t}}=1, ''i.e.'' {{math| ''φ''(''x'',1)}},  is a [[Bernoulli shift]].

Furthermore, this flow is unique, up to a constant rescaling of time.  That is, if {{math| ''ψ''(''x,t'')}},  is another flow with the same entropy, then 
{{math| ''ψ''(''x,t'') {{=}} ''φ''(''x,t'')}}, for some constant {{mvar|c}}.  The notion of uniqueness and isomorphism here is that of the [[isomorphism of dynamical systems]].  Many dynamical systems, including [[Sinai's billiards]] and [[Anosov flow]]s are isomorphic to Bernoulli shifts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16482">There are two fundamental [[theorems]] of [[welfare economics]]. The First Theorem states that a [[Market (economics)|market]] will tend toward a [[competitive equilibrium]] that is weakly [[Pareto optimal]] when the market maintains the following three attributes:&lt;ref&gt;http://web.stanford.edu/~hammond/effMktFail.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

1. [[Complete market]]s as no [[transaction costs]] and because of this each actor also has [[perfect information]].

2. [[Price-taking]] behavior as no monopolists and easy entry and exit from a market.

Furthermore, the First Theorem states that the equilibrium will be fully Pareto optimal with the additional condition of:

3. [[local nonsatiation|Local nonsatiation of preferences]] as for any original bundle of goods there is another bundle of goods arbitrarily close to the original bundle, but that is preferred.

The Second Theorem states that out of all possible Pareto optimal outcomes one can achieve any particular one by enacting a [[lump-sum]] wealth redistribution and then letting the market take over.

== Implications of the First Theorem ==

The First Theorem is often taken to be an analytical confirmation of [[Adam Smith]]'s "[[invisible hand]]" hypothesis, namely that ''competitive markets tend toward an efficient allocation of resources''. The theorem supports a case for non-intervention in ideal conditions: let the markets do the work and the outcome will be Pareto efficient.  However, Pareto efficiency is not necessarily the same thing as desirability; it merely indicates that no one can be made better off without someone being made worse off.  There can be many possible Pareto efficient allocations of resources and not all of them may be equally desirable by society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author-link=Joseph E. Stiglitz|first=Joseph E.|last=Stiglitz|title=Whither Socialism?|date=1994|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-69182-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This appears to make the case that intervention has a legitimate place in policy &amp;ndash; redistributions can allow us to select from all efficient outcomes for one that has other desired features, such as distributional equity. The shortcoming is that for the theorem to hold, the transfers have to be lump-sum and the government needs to have perfect information on individual consumers' tastes as well as the production possibilities of firms. An additional mathematical condition is that preferences and production technologies have to be [[convex preferences|convex]].&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95"&gt;{{citation|author-link=Andreu Mas-Colell|last1=Mas-Colell|first1=Andreu| first2=Michael D.|last2=Whinston|first3=Jerry R.|last3=Green|year=1995|title=Microeconomic Theory|chapter=Chapter 16: Equilibrium and its Basic Welfare Properties|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn= 0-19-510268-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proof of the First Theorem ===

The first fundamental theorem was first demonstrated graphically by economist [[Abba Lerner]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} and mathematically by economists [[Harold Hotelling]], [[Oskar Lange]], [[Maurice Allais]], [[Lionel W. McKenzie|Lionel McKenzie]], [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[Gérard Debreu]]. The theorem holds under general conditions.&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95"/&gt;

The formal statement of the theorem is as follows: ''If preferences are locally nonsatiated, and if &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{X^*},\mathbf{Y^*}, \mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt; is a price equilibrium with transfers, then the allocation &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{X^*},\mathbf{Y^*})&lt;/math&gt;is Pareto optimal.''  An equilibrium in this sense either relates to an exchange economy only or presupposes that firms are allocatively and productively efficient, which can be shown to follow from perfectly competitive factor and production markets.&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95"/&gt;

Given a set &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of types of goods we work in the real vector space over &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{G}&lt;/math&gt; and use boldface for vector valued variables.  For instance, if &lt;math&gt;G=\lbrace \text{butter}, \text{cookies}, \text{milk} \rbrace&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{G}&lt;/math&gt; would be a three dimensional vector space and the vector &lt;math&gt;\langle 1, 2, 3 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; would represent the bundle of goods containing one unit of butter, 2 units of cookies and 3 units of milk.

Suppose that consumer ''i'' has wealth &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_i w_i = \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{e} + \Sigma _j \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{y^*_j}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e} &lt;/math&gt; is the aggregate endowment of goods (i.e. the sum of all consumer and producer endowments) and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y^*_j}&lt;/math&gt; is the production of firm ''j''.

Preference maximization (from the definition of price equilibrium with transfers) implies (using &lt;math&gt; &gt;_i&lt;/math&gt; to denote the preference relation for consumer ''i''):

::if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x_i} &gt;_i \mathbf{x^*_i}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x_i} &gt; \mathbf{w_i}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, if a bundle of goods is strictly preferred to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x^*_i}&lt;/math&gt; it must be unaffordable at price &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;.  Local nonsatiation additionally implies:

::if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x_i} \geq _i \mathbf{x^*_i}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x_i} \geq \mathbf{w_i}&lt;/math&gt;

To see why, imagine that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x_i} \geq _i \mathbf{x^*_i}&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x_i} &lt; w_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Then by local nonsatiation we could find &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x'_i}&lt;/math&gt; arbitrarily close to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x_i}&lt;/math&gt; (and so still affordable) but which is strictly preferred to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x^*_i}&lt;/math&gt;.  But &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x^*_i}&lt;/math&gt; is the result of preference maximization, so this is a contradiction.

An allocation is a pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} \in \Pi_{i \in I} \mathbb{R}^{G} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y} \in \Pi_{j \in J} \mathbb{R}^{G} &lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the 'matrix' (allowing potentially infinite rows/columns) whose ''i''th column is the bundle of goods allocated to consumer ''i'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}&lt;/math&gt; is the 'matrix' whose ''j''th column is the production of firm ''j''.  We restrict our attention to feasible allocations which are those allocations in which no consumer sells or producer consumes goods which they lack, i.e.,for every good and every consumer that consumers initial endowment plus their net demand must be positive similarly for producers.

Now consider an allocation &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y})&lt;/math&gt; that Pareto dominates &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{X^*}, Y^*)&lt;/math&gt;.  This means that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x_i} \geq _i \mathbf{x^*_i}&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x_i} &gt;_i \mathbf{x^*_i}&lt;/math&gt; for some ''i''.  By the above, we know &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x_i} \geq w_i&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x_i} &gt; w_i&lt;/math&gt; for some ''i''.  Summing, we find:

::&lt;math&gt;\Sigma _i \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x_i} &gt; \Sigma _i w_i =  \Sigma _j \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{y^*_j}&lt;/math&gt;.

Because &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y^*}&lt;/math&gt; is profit maximizing, we know &lt;math&gt; \Sigma _j \mathbf{p} \cdot y^*_j \geq \Sigma _j p \cdot y_j &lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\Sigma _i \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x_i} &gt;  \Sigma _j \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{y_j}&lt;/math&gt;.  But goods must be conserved so &lt;math&gt;\Sigma _i \mathbf{x_i} &gt;  \Sigma _j \mathbf{y_j}&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y})&lt;/math&gt; is not feasible.  Since all Pareto-dominating allocations are not feasible, &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{X^*},\mathbf{Y^*})&lt;/math&gt; must itself be Pareto optimal.&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95" /&gt;

Note that while the fact that &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y^*}&lt;/math&gt; is profit maximizing is simply assumed in the statement of the theorem the result is only useful/interesting to the extent such a profit maximizing allocation of production is possible.  Fortunately, for any restriction of the production allocation &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y^*}&lt;/math&gt; and price to a closed subset on which the marginal price is bounded away from 0, e.g., any reasonable choice of continuous functions to parameterize possible productions, such a maximum exists.  This follows from the fact that the minimal marginal price and finite wealth limits the maximum feasible production (0 limits the minimum) and [[Tychonoff's theorem]] ensures the product of these compacts spaces is compact ensuring us a maximum of whatever continuous function we desire exists.

== Proof of the second fundamental theorem ==

The Second Theorem formally states that, under the assumptions that every production set &lt;math&gt;Y_j&lt;/math&gt; is [[convex set|convex]] and every preference relation &lt;math&gt;\geq _i&lt;/math&gt; is convex and [[local nonsatiation|locally nonsatiated]], any desired Pareto-efficient allocation can be supported as a price ''quasi''-equilibrium with transfers.&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95" /&gt; Further assumptions are needed to prove this statement for price equilibria with transfers.

The proof proceeds in two steps: first, we prove that any Pareto-efficient allocation can be supported as a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers; then, we give conditions under which a price quasi-equilibrium is also a price equilibrium.

Let us define a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers as an allocation &lt;math&gt;(x^*,y^*)&lt;/math&gt;, a price vector ''p'', and a vector of wealth levels ''w'' (achieved by lump-sum transfers) with &lt;math&gt;\Sigma _i w_i = p \cdot \omega + \Sigma _j p \cdot y^*_j&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; is the aggregate endowment of goods and &lt;math&gt;y^*_j&lt;/math&gt; is the production of firm ''j'') such that:

::i. &lt;math&gt;p \cdot y_j \leq p \cdot y_j^*&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;y_j \in Y_j&lt;/math&gt; (firms maximize profit by producing &lt;math&gt;y_j^*&lt;/math&gt;)
::ii. For all ''i'', if &lt;math&gt;x_i &gt;_i x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;p \cdot x_i \geq w_i&lt;/math&gt; (if &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is strictly preferred to &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; then it cannot cost less than &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt;)
::iii. &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_i x_i^* = \omega + \Sigma _j y_j^*&lt;/math&gt; (budget constraint satisfied)

The only difference between this definition and the standard definition of a price equilibrium with transfers is in statement (''ii''). The inequality is weak here (&lt;math&gt;p \cdot x_i \geq w_i&lt;/math&gt;) making it a price quasi-equilibrium. Later we will strengthen this to make a price equilibrium.&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95" /&gt;
Define &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; to be the set of all consumption bundles strictly preferred to &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; by consumer ''i'', and let ''V'' be the sum of all &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; is convex due to the convexity of the preference relation &lt;math&gt;\geq _i&lt;/math&gt;.  ''V'' is convex because every &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; is convex. Similarly &lt;math&gt;Y + \{\omega\}&lt;/math&gt;, the union of all production sets &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt; plus the aggregate endowment, is convex because every &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt; is convex. We also know that the intersection of ''V'' and &lt;math&gt;Y + \{\omega\}&lt;/math&gt; must be empty, because if it were not it would imply there existed a bundle that is strictly preferred to &lt;math&gt;(x^*,y^*)&lt;/math&gt; by everyone and is also affordable. This is ruled out by the Pareto-optimality of &lt;math&gt;(x^*,y^*)&lt;/math&gt;.

These two convex, non-intersecting sets allow us to apply the [[separating hyperplane theorem]]. This theorem states that there exists a price vector &lt;math&gt;p \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; and a number ''r'' such that &lt;math&gt;p \cdot z \geq r&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;z \in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p \cdot z \leq r&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;z \in Y + \{\omega\}&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, there exists a price vector that defines a hyperplane that perfectly separates the two convex sets.

Next we argue that if &lt;math&gt;x_i \geq _i x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i'' then &lt;math&gt;p \cdot (\Sigma _i x_i) \geq r&lt;/math&gt;. This is due to local nonsatiation: there must be a bundle &lt;math&gt;x'_i&lt;/math&gt; arbitrarily close to &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; that is strictly preferred to &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; and hence part of &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;p \cdot (\Sigma _i x'_i) \geq r&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;x'_i \rightarrow x_i&lt;/math&gt; does not change the weak inequality, so &lt;math&gt;p \cdot (\Sigma _i x_i) \geq r&lt;/math&gt; as well. In other words, &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is in the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of ''V''.

Using this relation we see that for &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; itself &lt;math&gt;p \cdot (\Sigma _i x_i^*) \geq r&lt;/math&gt;. We also know that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma _i x_i^* \in Y + \{\omega\}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;p \cdot (\Sigma _i x_i^*) \leq r&lt;/math&gt; as well. Combining these we find that &lt;math&gt;p \cdot (\Sigma _i x_i^*) = r&lt;/math&gt;. We can use this equation to show that &lt;math&gt;(x^*,y^*,p)&lt;/math&gt; fits the definition of a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers.

Because &lt;math&gt;p \cdot (\Sigma _i x_i^*) = r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma _i x_i^* = \omega + \Sigma _j y_j^*&lt;/math&gt; we know that for any firm j:

::&lt;math&gt;p \cdot (\omega + y_j + \Sigma_h y_h^*) \leq r = p \cdot (\omega + y_j^* + \Sigma_h y_h^*)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;h \neq j&lt;/math&gt;

which implies &lt;math&gt;p \cdot y_j \leq p \cdot y_j^*&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly we know:

::&lt;math&gt;p \cdot (x_i + \Sigma_k x_k^*) \geq r = p \cdot (x_i^* + \Sigma_k x_k^*)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k \neq i&lt;/math&gt;

which implies &lt;math&gt;p \cdot x_i \geq p \cdot x_i^*&lt;/math&gt;. These two statements, along with the feasibility of the allocation at the Pareto optimum, satisfy the three conditions for a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers supported by wealth levels &lt;math&gt;w_i = p \cdot x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i''.

We now turn to conditions under which a price quasi-equilibrium is also a price equilibrium, in other words, conditions under which the statement "if &lt;math&gt;x_i &gt;_i x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;p \cdot x_i \geq w_i&lt;/math&gt;" imples "if &lt;math&gt;x_i &gt;_i x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;p \cdot x_i &gt; w_i&lt;/math&gt;". For this to be true we need now to assume that the consumption set &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; is convex and the preference relation &lt;math&gt;\geq _i&lt;/math&gt; is [[continuous function|continuous]]. Then, if there exists a consumption vector &lt;math&gt;x'_i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x'_i \in X_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p \cdot x'_i &lt; w_i&lt;/math&gt;, a price quasi-equilibrium is a price equilibrium.

To see why, assume to the contrary &lt;math&gt;x_i &gt;_i x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p \cdot x_i = w_i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; exists. Then by the convexity of &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; we have a bundle &lt;math&gt;x''_i = \alpha x_i + (1 - \alpha)x'_i \in X_i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;p \cdot x''_i &lt; w_i&lt;/math&gt;. By the continuity of &lt;math&gt;\geq _i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; close to 1 we have &lt;math&gt;\alpha x_i + (1 - \alpha)x'_i &gt;_i x_i^*&lt;/math&gt;. This is a contradiction, because this bundle is preferred to &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; and costs less than &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence, for price quasi-equilibria to be price equilibria it is sufficient that the consumption set be convex, the preference relation to be continuous, and for there always to exist a "cheaper" consumption bundle &lt;math&gt;x'_i&lt;/math&gt;. One way to ensure the existence of such a bundle is to require wealth levels &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; to be strictly positive for all consumers ''i''.&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95" /&gt;

== Related theorems ==

Because of welfare economics' close ties to [[social choice theory]], [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] is sometimes listed as a third fundamental theorem.&lt;ref&gt;* {{citation|last=Feldman|first=Allan M.|year=2008|title=Welfare Economics|work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics|volume=4|pp=889–95|edition=online|url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_W000050|accessdate=9 June 2014|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideal conditions of the theorems, however are an abstraction. The [[Joseph Stiglitz#Information asymmetry|Greenwald-Stiglitz theorem]], for example, states that in the presence of either [[perfect information|imperfect information]], or incomplete markets, markets are not Pareto efficient. Thus, in real world economies, the degree of these variations from ideal conditions must factor into policy choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author-link=Joseph E. Stiglitz|first=Joseph E.|last=Stiglitz|doi=10.3386/w3641 |title=The Invisible Hand and Modern Welfare Economics |work=NBER Working Paper No. W3641 |date=March 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, even if these ideal conditions hold, the First Welfare Theorem fails in an [[overlapping generations model]].

In [[coding theory]], [[list decoding]] is an alternative to unique decoding of error-correcting codes for large error rates. Using unique decoder one can correct up to &lt;math&gt; \delta / 2 &lt;/math&gt;fraction of errors. But when error rate is greater than &lt;math&gt; \delta / 2 &lt;/math&gt;, unique decoder will not able to output the correct result. List decoding overcomes that issue. List decoding can correct more than &lt;math&gt; \delta / 2 &lt;/math&gt; fraction of errors.

There are many efficient algorithms that can perform List decoding.  In this article, we first present an algorithm for [[RS code|Reed–Solomon (RS) codes]] which corrects up to &lt;math&gt; 1 - \sqrt{2R}&lt;/math&gt; errors and is due to [[Madhu Sudan]].  Subsequently we describe the improved [[Venkatesan Guruswami|Guruswami]]–[[Madhu Sudan|Sudan]] list decoding algorithm, which can correct up to &lt;math&gt; 1 - \sqrt{R}&lt;/math&gt; errors.

Here is a plot of the rate R and distance &lt;math&gt; \delta&lt;/math&gt; for different algorithms.

== Algorithm 1 (Sudan's list decoding algorithm) ==

===Problem statement===

'''Input :''' A field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;; n distinct pairs of elements &lt;math&gt;{(x_{i},y_{i})_{i=1}^n}  &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;F \times F&lt;/math&gt;; and integers &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Output:''' A list of all functions &lt;math&gt;f: F \to  F &lt;/math&gt; satisfying

&lt;math&gt; f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial in &lt;math&gt; x&lt;/math&gt; of degree at most &lt;math&gt;d &lt;/math&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\#\{i|f(x_{i}) = y_{i}\} \ge t&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

To understand Sudan's Algorithm better, one may want to first know another algorithm which can be considered as the earlier version or the fundamental version of the algorithms for list decoding RS codes - the [[Berlekamp–Welch algorithm]].
Welch and Berlekamp initially came with an [[Berlekamp–Welch algorithm|algorithm]] which can solve the problem in polynomial time with best threshold on &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt; t \ge (n+d+1)/2&lt;/math&gt;. 
The mechanism of Sudan's Algorithm is almost the same as the algorithm of Berlekamp–Welch Algorithm,  except in the step 1, one wants to compute a bivariate polynomial of bounded &lt;math&gt;(1, k)&lt;/math&gt; degree. Sudan's list decoding algorithm for Reed–Solomon code which is an improvement on Berlekamp and Welch algorithm, can solve the problem with &lt;math&gt; t = (\sqrt{2nd})&lt;/math&gt;.This bound is better than the unique decoding bound &lt;math&gt; 1 - \left (\frac{R} {2} \right)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;R &lt; 0.07&lt;/math&gt;.

===Algorithm===

'''Definition 1 (weighted degree)'''

For weights &lt;math&gt;w_x,w_y \in \mathbb{Z}^+ &lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;(w_x,w_y)&lt;/math&gt; – weighted degree of monomial &lt;math&gt; q_{ij}x^i y^j&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;iw_x + jw_y&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;(w_x,w_y)&lt;/math&gt; – weighted degree of a polynomial &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y) = \sum_{ij} q_{ij}x^iy^j&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum, over the monomials with non-zero coefficients, of the &lt;math&gt;(w_x,w_y)&lt;/math&gt; – weighted degree of the monomial.

For example, &lt;math&gt;xy^2&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;(1,3) &lt;/math&gt;-degree 7

'''Algorithm:'''

Inputs: &lt;math&gt;n,d,t&lt;/math&gt;; {&lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1)\cdots(x_n,y_n)&lt;/math&gt;} /* Parameters l,m to be set later. */

Step 1: Find a non-zero bivariate polynomial &lt;math&gt;Q : F^2 \mapsto F&lt;/math&gt; satisfying
* &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;(1,d)&lt;/math&gt;-weighted degree at most &lt;math&gt;D=m+ld&lt;/math&gt;
* For every &lt;math&gt;i \in [n]&lt;/math&gt;,

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;Q(x_i,y_i) = 0&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Step 2. Factor Q into irreducible factors.

Step 3. Output all the polynomials &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; (y- f(x))&lt;/math&gt; is a factor of Q and &lt;math&gt;f(x_i) = y_i&lt;/math&gt; for at least t values of &lt;math&gt;i \in [n]&lt;/math&gt;

=== Analysis ===

One has to prove that the above algorithm runs in polynomial time and outputs the correct result. That can be done by proving following set of claims.

'''Claim 1:'''

If a function &lt;math&gt;Q : F^2 \to F&lt;/math&gt; satisfying (2) exists, then one can find it in polynomial time.

'''Proof:'''

Note that a bivariate polynomial &lt;math&gt;Q(x, y )&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;(1, d)&lt;/math&gt;-weighted degree at most &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; can be uniquely written as &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y) = \sum_{j=0}^l \sum_{k=0}^{m+(l-j)d} q_{kj} x^k y^j&lt;/math&gt;. Then one has to find the coefficients &lt;math&gt;q_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the constraints &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^l \sum_{k=0}^{m+(l-j)d} q_{kj} x_i^k y_i^j = 0&lt;/math&gt;, for every &lt;math&gt; i \in [n]&lt;/math&gt;. This is a linear set of equations in the unknowns {&lt;math&gt;q_{kj}&lt;/math&gt;}. One can find a solution using [[Gaussian elimination]] in polynomial time.

'''Claim 2:'''

If &lt;math&gt;(m+1)(l+1)+d \begin{pmatrix}l + 1\\2\end{pmatrix} &gt; n&lt;/math&gt; then there exists a function &lt;math&gt; Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying (2)

'''Proof:'''

To ensure a non zero solution exists, the number of coefficients in &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; should be greater than the number of constraints. Assume that the maximum degree &lt;math&gt;deg_x(Q)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y) &lt;/math&gt; is m and the maximum degree &lt;math&gt;deg_y(Q)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y) &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. Then the degree of &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; will be at most &lt;math&gt; m+ld &lt;/math&gt;.  One has to see that the linear system is homogenous. The setting &lt;math&gt;q_{jk} = 0&lt;/math&gt; satisfies all linear constraints. However this does not satisfy (2), since the solution can be identically zero. To ensure that a non-zero solution exists, one has to make sure that number of unknowns in the linear system to be &lt;math&gt;(m+1)(l+1)+d \begin{pmatrix}l + 1\\2\end{pmatrix} &gt; n&lt;/math&gt;, so that one can have a non zero &lt;math&gt; Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;. Since this value is greater than n, there are more variables than constraints and therefore a non-zero solution exists.

'''Claim 3:'''

If &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is a function satisfying (2) and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is function satisfying (1) and &lt;math&gt;t&gt;m+ld&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(y-f(x)) &lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:'''

Consider a function &lt;math&gt;p(x) = Q(x,f(x))&lt;/math&gt;. This is a polynomial in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and argue that it has degree at most &lt;math&gt;m+ld&lt;/math&gt;. Consider any monomial &lt;math&gt;q_{jk}x^k y^j&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Q(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;(1,d)&lt;/math&gt;-weighted degree at most &lt;math&gt;m+ld&lt;/math&gt;, one can say that &lt;math&gt;k+jd \le m+ld&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the term &lt;math&gt;q_{kj}x^kf(x)^j&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial in  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of degree at most  &lt;math&gt;k+jd \le m+ld&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;p(x) &lt;/math&gt; has degree at most &lt;math&gt;m+ld&lt;/math&gt;

Next argue that &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is identically zero. Since &lt;math&gt;Q(x_i,f(x_i)) &lt;/math&gt; is zero whenever &lt;math&gt; y_i = f(x_i) &lt;/math&gt;, one can say that &lt;math&gt;p(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; is zero for strictly greater than &lt;math&gt; m+ld &lt;/math&gt; points. Thus &lt;math&gt;p &lt;/math&gt;has more zeroes than its degree and hence is identically zero, implying &lt;math&gt; Q(x,f(x)) \equiv 0&lt;/math&gt;

Finding optimal values for &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;.
Note that &lt;math&gt; m+ld &lt;t &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(m+1)(l+1)+d \begin{pmatrix}l + 1\\2\end{pmatrix} &gt; n &lt;/math&gt;
For a given value  &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, one can compute the smallest &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; for which the second condition holds
By interchanging the second condition one can get &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; to be at most &lt;math&gt;(n+1-d \begin{pmatrix}l + 1\\2\end{pmatrix})/2 - 1 &lt;/math&gt;
Substituting this value into first condition one can get &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to be at least &lt;math&gt;\frac{n+1}{l+1} + \frac{dl}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
Next minimize the above equation of unknown parameter &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. One can do that by taking derivative of the equation and equating that to zero
By doing that one will get, &lt;math&gt; l = \sqrt{\frac{2(n+1)}{d}} -1 &lt;/math&gt;
Substituting back the &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; value into &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; one will get
&lt;math&gt; m \ge \sqrt{\frac{(n+1)d}{2}} - \sqrt{\frac {(n+1)d}{2}} + \frac{d}{2} - 1 = \frac{d}{2} -1 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; t &gt; \sqrt{\frac{2(n+1)d^2}{d}} - \frac {d}{2} -1 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; t &gt; \sqrt{2(n+1)d} - \frac {d}{2} -1 &lt;/math&gt;

== Algorithm 2 (Guruswami–Sudan list decoding algorithm) ==

===Definition===

Consider a &lt;math&gt;(n,k)&lt;/math&gt; Reed–Solomon code over the finite field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F} = GF(q)&lt;/math&gt; with evaluation set &lt;math&gt;(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_n)&lt;/math&gt; and a positive integer &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the Guruswami-Sudan List Decoder accepts a vector &lt;math&gt;\beta = (\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots,\beta_n)&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}^n&lt;/math&gt; as input, and outputs a list of polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;\le k&lt;/math&gt; which are in 1 to 1 correspondence with codewords.

The idea is to add more restrictions on the bi-variate polynomial &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; which results in the increment of constraints along with the number of roots.

===Multiplicity===

A bi-variate polynomial &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; has a zero of multiplicity &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; has no term of degree &lt;math&gt;\le r&lt;/math&gt;, where the ''x''-degree of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the maximum degree of any x term in &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\qquad&lt;/math&gt;   &lt;math&gt;deg_x f(x)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\max_{i \in I} \{i\}&lt;/math&gt;

For example: 
Let &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y) = y - 4x^2&lt;/math&gt;.

https://wiki.cse.buffalo.edu/cse545/sites/wiki.cse.buffalo.edu.cse545/files/76/Fig1.jpg

Hence, &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; has a zero of multiplicity 1 at (0,0).

Let &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y) = y +  6x^2&lt;/math&gt;.

https://wiki.cse.buffalo.edu/cse545/sites/wiki.cse.buffalo.edu.cse545/files/76/Fig2.jpg

Hence, &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; has a zero of multiplicity 1 at (0,0).

Let &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y) = (y -  4x^2) (y +  6x^2) = y^2 + 6x^2y - 4x^2y -24x^4&lt;/math&gt;

https://wiki.cse.buffalo.edu/cse545/sites/wiki.cse.buffalo.edu.cse545/files/76/Fig3.jpg

Hence, &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; has a zero of multiplicity 2 at (0,0).

Similarly, if &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y) = [(y - \beta) -  4(x - \alpha)^2)] [(y - \beta) +  6(x - \alpha)^2)]&lt;/math&gt;
Then, &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; has a zero of multiplicity 2 at &lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt;.

====General definition of multiplicity====
&lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; roots at &lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; if  &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; has a zero of multiplicity &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta) \ne (0,0)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Algorithm===
Let the transmitted codeword be &lt;math&gt;( f(\alpha_1), f(\alpha_2),\ldots,f(\alpha_n))&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_n)&lt;/math&gt; be the support set of the transmitted codeword &amp; the received word be &lt;math&gt;(\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots,\beta_n)&lt;/math&gt;

The algorithm is as follows:

• '''Interpolation step'''

For a received vector &lt;math&gt;(\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots,\beta_n)&lt;/math&gt;, construct a non-zero bi-variate polynomial &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;(1,k)-&lt;/math&gt;weighted degree of at most &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; has a zero of multiplicity &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; at each of the points &lt;math&gt;(\alpha_i,\beta_i)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; 1 \le i \le n&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;Q(\alpha_i,\beta_i) = 0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

• '''Factorization step'''

Find all the factors of &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; of the form &lt;math&gt;y - p(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p(\alpha_i) = \beta_i&lt;/math&gt; for at least &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; values of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;0 \le i \le n&lt;/math&gt; &amp; &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;\le k&lt;/math&gt;

Recall that polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;\le k&lt;/math&gt; are in 1 to 1 correspondence with codewords. Hence, this step outputs the list of codewords.

===Analysis===

====Interpolation step====

'''Lemma:'''
Interpolation step implies &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}r + 1\\2\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; constraints on the coefficients of &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y) = \sum_{i = 0, j = 0} ^{i = m, j = p} a_{i,j} x^i y^j&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\deg_x Q(x,y) = m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\deg_y Q(x,y) = p&lt;/math&gt;

Then, &lt;math&gt;Q(x + \alpha, y + \beta)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sum_{u = 0, v = 0} ^{r}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;Q_{u,v}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(\alpha, \beta)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;x^{u}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;y^{v}&lt;/math&gt; ........................(Equation 1)

where  &lt;math&gt;Q_{u,v}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i = 0, j = 0} ^{i = m, j = p}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}i\\u\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}j\\v\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;a_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;x^{i-u}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;y^{j-v}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof of Equation 1:'''

: &lt;math&gt;Q(x + \alpha,y + \beta) = \sum_{i,j} a_{i,j} (x + \alpha)^i (y + \beta)^j&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q(x + \alpha,y + \beta)=\sum_{i,j} a_{i,j} \Bigg ( \sum_u \begin{pmatrix}i\\u\end{pmatrix} x^u \alpha^{i-u} \Bigg ) \Bigg ( \sum_v \begin{pmatrix}i\\v\end{pmatrix} y^v \beta^{j-v} \Bigg )&lt;/math&gt;.................Using binomial expansion

: &lt;math&gt;Q(x + \alpha,y + \beta) = \sum_{u,v}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;Q_{u,v} (\alpha, \beta) x^u y^v &lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof of Lemma:'''

The polynomial &lt;math&gt;Q(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; has a zero of multiplicity &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; if

: &lt;math&gt;Q_{u,v}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;0 \le u + v \le r - 1&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; can take &lt;math&gt;r - v&lt;/math&gt; values as &lt;math&gt;0 \le v \le r-1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the total number of constraints is
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{v = 0}^{r-1} {r - v}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}r + 1\\2\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}r + 1\\2\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; number of selections can be made for &lt;math&gt;(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; and each selection implies constraints on the coefficients of &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;

===Factorization step===

'''Proposition:'''

&lt;math&gt;Q(x, p(x)) \equiv 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;y - p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a factor of &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:'''

Since, &lt;math&gt;y - p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a factor of &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; can be represented as

&lt;math&gt;Q(x,y) = L(x,y) (y - p(x))&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;R(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt;L(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient obtained when &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is divided by &lt;math&gt;y - p(x)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;R(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the remainder

Now, if &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math&gt;Q(x, p(x))&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, only if &lt;math&gt;R(x)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem:'''

If &lt;math&gt;p(\alpha) = \beta&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(x - \alpha) ^r&lt;/math&gt; is a factor of &lt;math&gt;Q(x,p(x))&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:'''

&lt;math&gt;Q(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sum_{u,v}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;Q_{u,v}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(\alpha, \beta)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(x - \alpha)^{u}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(y - \beta)^{v}&lt;/math&gt;...........................From Equation 2

&lt;math&gt;Q(x, p(x))&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sum_{u,v}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;Q_{u,v}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(\alpha, \beta)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(x - \alpha)^{u}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(p(x) - \beta)^{v}&lt;/math&gt;

Given, &lt;math&gt;p(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(p(x) - \beta)&lt;/math&gt; mod &lt;math&gt;(x - \alpha)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, &lt;math&gt;(x - \alpha)^{u}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(p(x) - \beta)^{v}&lt;/math&gt; mod &lt;math&gt;(x - \alpha) ^{u+v}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, &lt;math&gt;(x - \alpha) ^r&lt;/math&gt; is a factor of &lt;math&gt;Q(x,p(x))&lt;/math&gt;.

As proved above,

&lt;math&gt;t \cdot r &gt; D&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t &gt; \frac{D} {r}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{D(D+2)} {2(k-1)} &gt; n\begin{pmatrix}r + 1\\2\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where LHS is the upper bound on the number of coefficients of &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; and RHS is the earlier proved Lemma.

: &lt;math&gt;D = \sqrt{knr(r-1)} \, &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;t = \left \lceil{\sqrt{kn (1 - \frac{1}{r})}} \right \rceil&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute &lt;math&gt;r = 2kn&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;t &gt; \left \lceil {\sqrt{kn - \frac{1}{2}}} \right \rceil &gt; \left \lceil {\sqrt{kn}} \right \rceil&lt;/math&gt;

Hence proved, that Guruswami–Sudan List Decoding Algorithm can list decode [[Reed–Solomon error correction|Reed-Solomon(RS) codes]] up to &lt;math&gt;1 - \sqrt{R}&lt;/math&gt; errors.

In [[chemical graph theory]], the '''hyper-Wiener index''' or '''hyper-Wiener number''' is a [[topological index]] of a [[molecule]], used in [[biochemistry]]. The hyper-Wiener index is a generalization introduced by [[Milan Randić]]

 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; of the concept of the [[Wiener index]], introduced by [[Harry Wiener]]. The hyper-Wiener index of a [[connected graph]] ''G'' is defined by

: &lt;math&gt;WW(G)=\frac 1 2 \sum_{u,v\in V(G)}(d(u,v)+d^2(u,v)),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d''(''u'',''v'') is the distance between vertex ''u'' and&amp;nbsp;''v''.
Hyper-Wiener index as topological index assigned to ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',''E'') is based on the [[distance function]] which is invariant under the action of the [[automorphism group]] of&amp;nbsp;''G''.

==Example==

One-pentagonal carbon nanocone which is an infinite symmetric graph, consists of one pentagon as its core surrounded by layers of hexagons. If there are ''n'' layers, then the graph of the molecules is denoted by ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
we have the following explicit formula for hyper-Wiener index of one-pentagonal carbon nanocone,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In [[mathematics]], an '''injective function''' or '''injection''' or '''one-to-one function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that preserves [[Distinct (mathematics)|distinctness]]: it never maps distinct elements of its [[Domain of a function|domain]] to the same element of its [[codomain]]. In other words, every element of the function's codomain is the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of ''at most'' one element of its domain. The term ''one-to-one function'' must not be confused with ''one-to-one correspondence'' (a.k.a.  [[bijective function]]), which uniquely maps all elements in both domain and codomain to each other (see figures).

Occasionally, an injective function from ''X'' to ''Y'' is denoted {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' ↣ ''Y''}}, using an arrow with a barbed tail ({{unichar|21A3|RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH TAIL|ulink=Unicode}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Unicode| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2190.pdf| accessdate = 2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of injective functions from ''X'' to ''Y'' may be denoted ''Y''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;''X''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; using a notation derived from that used for [[falling factorial power]]s, since if ''X'' and ''Y'' are finite sets with respectively ''m'' and ''n'' elements, the number of injections from ''X'' to ''Y'' is ''n''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;''m''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (see the [[Twelvefold way#case i|twelvefold way]]).

A function ''f'' that is not injective is sometimes called many-to-one. However, the injective terminology is also sometimes used to mean "single-valued", i.e., each argument is mapped to at most one value.

A [[monomorphism]] is a generalization of an injective function in [[category theory]].

== Definition ==
{{details|topic=notation|Function (mathematics)#Notation}}
Let ''f'' be a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] whose [[Domain of a function|domain]] is a set ''X''. The function ''f'' is said to be '''injective''' provided that for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X'', whenever {{nowrap|1=''f''(''a'') = ''f''(''b'')}}, then {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}}; that is, {{nowrap|1=''f''(''a'') = ''f''(''b'')}} implies {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}}.&amp;nbsp; Equivalently, if {{nowrap|''a'' ≠ ''b''}}, then {{nowrap|''f''(''a'') ≠ ''f''(''b'')}}.

Symbolically,

: &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b \in X, \;\; f(a)=f(b) \Rightarrow a=b&lt;/math&gt;

which is logically equivalent to the [[Contraposition|contrapositive]],

: &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b \in X, \;\; a \neq b \Rightarrow f(a) \neq f(b)&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
*For any set ''X'' and any subset ''S'' of ''X'' the [[inclusion map]] {{nowrap|''S'' → ''X''}} (which sends any element ''s'' of ''S'' to itself) is injective. In particular the [[identity function]] {{nowrap|''X'' → ''X''}} is always injective (and in fact bijective).
*If the domain {{nowrap|1=''X'' = [[∅]]}} or ''X'' has only one element, the function {{nowrap|''X'' → ''Y''}} is always injective.
*The function {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = 2''x'' + 1}} is injective.
*The function {{nowrap|''g'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by {{nowrap|1=''g''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is ''not'' injective, because (for example) {{nowrap|1=''g''(1) = 1 = ''g''(−1)}}. However, if ''g'' is redefined so that its domain is the non-negative real numbers &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,+∞)&lt;/nowiki&gt;, then ''g'' is injective.
*The [[exponential function]] {{nowrap|exp : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by {{nowrap|1=exp(''x'') = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is injective (but not [[surjective]] as no real value maps to a negative number).
*The [[natural logarithm]] function {{nowrap|ln : (0, ∞) → '''R'''}} defined by {{nowrap|''x'' ↦ ln ''x''}} is injective.
*The function {{nowrap|''g'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by {{nowrap|1=''g''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''x''}} is not injective, since, for example, {{nowrap|1=''g''(0) = ''g''(1) = 0}}.

More generally, when ''X'' and ''Y'' are both the [[real line]] '''R''', then an injective function {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} is one whose graph is never intersected by any horizontal line more than once. This principle is referred to as the ''[[horizontal line test]]''.

Every one ''x'' in ''X'' maps to exactly one unique ''y'' in ''Y''. The circled parts of the axes represent domain and range sets – in accordance with the standard diagrams above.]]

That is, only one ''x'' in ''X'' maps to one ''y'' in ''Y''.]]

== Injections can be undone ==
Functions with [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|left inverses]] are always injections. That is, given {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}}, if there is a function {{nowrap|''g'' : ''Y'' → ''X''}} such that, for every {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''X''}},

:''g''(''f''(''x'')) = ''x'' (''f'' can be undone by ''g'')
 
then ''f'' is injective. In this case, ''g'' is called a [[Retract (category theory)|retraction]] of ''f''. Conversely, ''f'' is called a [[Retract (category theory)|section]] of ''g''.

Conversely, every injection ''f'' with non-empty domain has a left inverse ''g'', which can be defined by fixing an element ''a'' in the domain of ''f'' so that ''g''(''x'') equals the unique preimage of ''x'' under ''f'' if it exists and ''g''(''x'') = ''a'' otherwise.{{refn|Unlike the corresponding statement that every surjective function has a left inverse, this does not require the [[axiom of choice]], as the existence of ''a'' is implied by the non-emptiness of the domain. However, this statement may fail in less conventional mathematics such as [[constructive mathematics]]. In constructive mathematics, the inclusion {{nowrap|{0,1} → '''R'''}} of the two-element set in the reals cannot have a left inverse, as it would violate [[indecomposability]], by giving a [[Retract (category theory)|retraction]] of the real line to the set {0,1}.}} 

The left inverse ''g'' is not necessarily an [[inverse function|inverse]] of ''f'' because the composition in the other order, {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}}, may differ from the identity on ''Y''. In other words, an injective function can be  "reversed" by a left inverses, but is not necessarily [[inverse function|invertible]], which requires that the function is [[bijective]].

== Injections may be made invertible ==

In fact, to turn an injective function {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} into a [[bijective function|bijective]] (hence [[Inverse function|invertible]]) function, it suffices to replace its codomain ''Y'' by its actual range {{nowrap|1=''J'' = ''f''(''X'')}}. That is, let {{nowrap|''g'' : ''X'' → ''J''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''g''(''x'') = ''f''(''x'')}} for all ''x'' in ''X''; then ''g'' is bijective. Indeed, ''f'' can be factored as {{nowrap|incl&lt;sub&gt;''J'',''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''g''}}, where {{nowrap|incl&lt;sub&gt;''J'',''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[inclusion function]] from ''J'' into ''Y''.

More generally, injective [[partial function]]s are called [[partial bijection]]s.

== Other properties ==
* If ''f'' and ''g'' are both injective, then {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}} is injective.
[[Image:Injective composition2.svg|thumb|300px|The composition of two injective functions is injective.]]
* If {{nowrap|''g'' ∘ ''f''}} is injective, then ''f'' is injective (but ''g'' need not be).
* {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is injective if and only if, given any functions ''g'', {{nowrap|''h'' : ''W'' → ''X''}} whenever {{nowrap|1=''f'' ∘ ''g'' = ''f'' ∘ ''h''}}, then {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''h''}}. In other words, injective functions are precisely the [[monomorphism]]s in the [[category theory|category]] '''[[Category of sets|Set]]''' of sets.
* If {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is injective and ''A'' is a [[subset]] of ''X'', then {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''(''A'')) = ''A''}}. Thus, ''A'' can be recovered from its [[image (function)|image]] ''f''(''A'').
* If {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is injective and ''A'' and ''B'' are both subsets of ''X'', then {{nowrap|1=''f''(''A'' ∩ ''B'') = ''f''(''A'') ∩ ''f''(''B'')}}.
* Every function {{nowrap|''h'' : ''W'' → ''Y''}} can be decomposed as {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''f'' ∘ ''g''}} for a suitable injection ''f'' and surjection ''g''. This decomposition is unique [[up to isomorphism]], and ''f'' may be thought of as the [[inclusion function]] of the range ''h''(''W'') of ''h'' as a subset of the codomain ''Y'' of ''h''.
* If {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is an injective function, then ''Y'' has at least as many elements as ''X'', in the sense of [[cardinal number]]s. In particular, if, in addition, there is an injection from ''Y&lt;'' to ''X'', then ''X'' and ''Y'' have the same cardinal number. (This is known as the [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]].)
* If both ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set|finite]] with the same number of elements, then {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is injective if and only if ''f'' is [[surjective]] (in which case ''f'' is [[bijective]]).
*An injective function which is a [[homomorphism]] between two algebraic structures is an [[embedding]].
*Unlike surjectivity, which is a relation between the graph of a function and its codomain, injectivity is a property of the graph of the function alone; that is, whether a function ''f'' is injective can be decided by only considering the graph (and not the codomain) of ''f''.

==Proving that functions are injective==
A proof that a function ''f'' is injective depends on how the function is presented and what properties the function holds.
For functions that are given by some formula there is a basic idea.
We use the contrapositive of the definition of injectivity, namely that if {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''y'')}}, then {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Peter|title=Proving Functions One-to-One|url=http://www.math.csusb.edu/notes/proofs/bpf/node4.html|archivedate= 4 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170604162511/http://www.math.csusb.edu/notes/proofs/bpf/node4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is an example:
: ''f'' = 2''x'' + 3

Proof: Let {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}}.  Suppose {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''y'')}}.  So {{nowrap|1=2''x'' + 3 = 2''y'' + 3}} ⇒ {{nowrap|1=2''x'' = 2''y''}} ⇒ {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}}.  Therefore, it follows from the definition that ''f'' is injective.

There are multiple other methods of proving that a function is injective.  For example, in calculus if ''f'' is a differentiable function defined on some interval, then it is sufficient to show that the derivative is always positive or always negative on that interval.  In linear algebra, if ''f'' is a linear transformation it is sufficient to show that the kernel of ''f'' contains only the zero vector.  If ''f'' is a function with finite domain it is sufficient to look through the list of images of each domain element and check that no image occurs twice on the list.

In the [[Middle Ages]], variations on the [[liar paradox]] were studied under the name of '''''insolubilia''''' ("insolubles").

==Overview==
Although the liar paradox was well known in [[Ancient history|antiquity]], interest seems to have lapsed until the twelfth century, when it appears to have been reinvented independently of ancient authors. Medieval interest may have been inspired by a passage in the ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'' of [[Aristotle]]. Although the ''Sophistical Refutations'' are consistently cited by medieval logicians from the earliest ''insolubilia'' literature, medieval studies of ''insolubilia'' go well beyond Aristotle. Other ancient sources which could suggest the liar paradox, including [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Cicero]], and the quotation of [[Epimenides]] appearing in the [[Epistle to Titus]], were not cited in discussions of ''insolubilia''.

[[Adam of Balsham]] mentioned, in passing, some paradoxical statements (dated to 1132), but he did not dwell on the difficulties raised by these statements. [[Alexander Neckham]], writing later in the twelfth century, explicitly recognized the paradoxical nature of ''insolubilia'', but did not attempt to resolve the inconsistent implications of the paradox. The first resolution was given by an anonymous author at the end of the twelfth or beginning of the thirteenth century. There was an established literature on the topic by about 1320, when [[Thomas Bradwardine]] prefaced his own discussion of ''insolubilia'' with nine views then current. Interest in ''insolubilia'' continued throughout the fourteenth century, especially by [[Jean Buridan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George Edward Hughes|Hughes, G.E.]] (1982). ''John Buridan on Self-Reference: Chapter Eight of Buridan's Sophismata.'' An edition and translation with an introduction, and philosophical commentary. Cambridge/London/New York: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-28864-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval ''insolubilia'' literature seems to treat these paradoxes as difficult but not truly "insoluble", and, though interesting and meriting investigation, not central to the study of logic. This may be contrasted with modern studies of self-referential paradoxes such as [[Russell's paradox]], in which  the problems are seen as fundamentally insoluble, and central to the foundations of logic.

He worked on a variety of areas of algebra, including [[ring theory]], with over 100 research papers and over a dozen books.

==Biography==
Herstein was born in [[Lublin]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], in 1923. His family emigrated to Canada in 1926, and he grew up in a harsh and underprivileged environment where, according to him, "you either became a [[gangster]] or a [[college professor]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year= 1989|title= Obituary: Israel Nathan Herstein|journal= Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society|volume= 21|issue= 6|pages= 594–600|publisher= London Mathematical Society|doi= 10.1112/blms/21.6.594|url= http://blms.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/6/594.extract|accessdate= March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his school years he played [[association football|football]], [[ice hockey]], [[golf]], [[tennis]], and [[billiards|pool]]. He also worked as a steeplejack and as a barker at a fair. He received his B.S. degree from the [[University of Manitoba]] and his M.A. from the [[University of Toronto]]. He received his [[Ph.D]] from [[Indiana University]] in 1948. His advisor was [[Max Zorn]]. He held positions at the [[University of Kansas]], [[Ohio State University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Cornell University]] before permanently settling at the University of Chicago in 1962. He was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1960–1961.

He is known for his lucid style of writing, as exemplified by his ''Topics in Algebra'', an undergraduate introduction to [[abstract algebra]] that was first published in 1964, with a second edition in 1975. A more advanced text is his ''Noncommutative Rings''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wonenburger, Maria J. |authorlink=Maria Wonenburger|title=Review: ''Noncommutative rings'' by I. N.

His primary interest was in [[noncommutative ring|noncommutative ring theory]], but he also wrote papers on [[finite group]]s, [[linear algebra]], and [[mathematical economics]].

He had 30 Ph.D. students, traveled and lectured widely, and spoke Italian, Hebrew, Polish, and Portuguese. He died from cancer in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in 1988. His doctoral students include [[Miriam Cohen]], [[Susan Montgomery]], [[Karen Parshall]] and [[Claudio Procesi]].

'''John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|OM|PC|PRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|eɪ|l|i}}; 12 November 1842&amp;nbsp;– 30 June 1919), was a British scientist who made extensive contributions to both [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] and [[experimental physics]].  He spent all of his academic career at the [[University of Cambridge]].  Among many honours, he received the 1904 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] "for his investigations of the densities of the most important gases and for his discovery of [[argon]] in connection with these studies."  He served as President of the [[Royal Society]] from 1905 to 1908 and as Chancellor of the University of Cambridge from 1908 to 1919.

Rayleigh provided the first theoretical treatment of the elastic scattering of light by particles much smaller than the light's wavelength, a phenomenon now known as "[[Rayleigh scattering]]", which notably explains why the sky is blue.  He studied and described transverse [[surface wave]]s in solids, now known as "[[Rayleigh wave]]s".  He contributed extensively to [[fluid dynamics]], with concepts such as the [[Rayleigh number]] (a [[dimensionless number]] associated with [[natural convection]]), [[Rayleigh flow]], the [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability]], and Rayleigh's criterion for the stability of [[Taylor–Couette flow]].  He also formulated the circulation theory of [[Lift (force)|aerodynamic lift]].  In [[optics]], Rayleigh proposed a well known criterion for [[angular resolution]].  His derivation of the [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]] for classical black-body radiation later played an important role in birth of [[quantum mechanics]] (see [[Ultraviolet catastrophe]]).  Rayleigh's textbook ''The Theory of Sound'' (1877) is still used today by [[Acoustics|acousticians]] and engineers.

==Biography==
Strutt was born on 12 November 1842 at Langford Grove in [[Maldon, Essex]]. In his early years he suffered from frailty and poor health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Popular Science Monthly |title=Sketch of Lord Rayleigh |pages=840 ''ff'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fiwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA840 |date=October 1884 |volume=25 |issue=46 |publisher=Bonnier Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Eton College]] and [[Harrow School]] (each for only a short period),&lt;ref name=prixnobel/&gt; before going on to the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1861 where he studied mathematics at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree ([[Senior Wrangler]] and 1st [[Smith's Prize]]) in 1865, and a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, on the death of his father, John Strutt, 2nd Baron Rayleigh, he inherited the [[Baron Rayleigh|Barony of Rayleigh]].

He was the second [[Cavendish Professor of Physics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] (following [[James Clerk Maxwell]]), from 1879 to 1884. He first described [[dynamic soaring]] by [[seabirds]] in 1883, in the British journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. From 1887 to 1905 he was Professor of [[Natural Philosophy]] at the [[Royal Institution]].

Around the year 1900 Rayleigh developed the ''duplex'' (combination of two) theory of human sound localisation using two [[binaural beats|binaural cues]], [[interaural time difference|interaural phase difference]] (IPD) and [[interaural level difference]] (ILD) (based on analysis of a spherical head with no external [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinnae]]). The theory posits that we use two primary cues for sound lateralisation, using the difference in the phases of [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al components of the sound and the difference in amplitude (level) between the two ears.

In 1919, Rayleigh served as President of the [[Society for Psychical Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Presidents|url=http://www.spr.ac.uk/page/past-presidents-parapsychology|publisher=Society for Psychical Research|accessdate=19 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223112644/http://www.spr.ac.uk/page/past-presidents-parapsychology|archivedate=23 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an advocate that simplicity and theory be part of the scientific method, Rayleigh argued for the [[principle of similitude]].

Rayleigh was elected Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] on 12 June 1873, and served as president of the Royal Society from 1905 to 1908. From time to time Rayleigh participated in the [[House of Lords]]; however, he spoke up only if politics attempted to become involved in science.

He died on 30 June 1919, in [[Witham]], Essex.&lt;ref name=prixnobel/&gt; He was succeeded, as the 4th Lord Rayleigh, by his son [[Robert John Strutt]], another well-known physicist. Lord Rayleigh was buried in the graveyard of All Saints' Church in [[Terling]] in Essex.

The [[rayl]] unit of acoustic impedance is named after him.

==Religious views==
Rayleigh was an [[Anglican]]. Though he did not write about the relationship of science and religion, he retained a personal interest in spiritual matters.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Bowler (2014). ''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain'', University of Chicago Press. p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; When his scientific papers were to be published in a collection by the [[Cambridge University Press]], Strutt wanted to include a religious quotation from the [[Bible]], but he was discouraged from doing so, as he later reported:

{{quote|When I was bringing out my ''Scientific Papers'' I proposed a motto from the [[Psalms]], ''"The Works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein."'' The Secretary to the Press suggested with many apologies that the reader might suppose that '''I''' was the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;Robert John Strutt Baron Rayleigh (1924). ''John William Strutt: Third Baron Rayleigh, O.M., F.R.S., Sometime President of the Royal Society and Chancellor of the University of Cambridge'', E. Arnold &amp; Company, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lord Rayleigh (Robert John Strutt), John William Strutt Baron Rayleigh (1964). "An Appraisal of Rayleigh", Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories, Office of Aerospace Research, U.S. Air Force. p. 1150.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Still, he had his wish and the quotation was printed in the five-volume collection of scientific papers.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Duncan (2008). ''Elements of Faith'', New Leaf Publishing Group., p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to a family member, he wrote about his rejection of [[materialism]] and spoke of [[Jesus Christ]] as a moral teacher:

{{quote|I have never thought the materialist view possible, and I look to a power beyond what we see, and to a life in which we may at least hope to take part. What is more, I think that Christ and indeed other spiritually gifted men see further and truer than I do, and I wish to follow them as far as I can.|Rayleigh (1910)&lt;ref&gt;Melba Phillips (1992), ''The Life and Times of Modern Physics: History of Physics II''. American Institute of Physics. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in R. J. Strutt. John William Strutt. p. 361. in ''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain'', by Peter J. Bowler (2014). p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir William Gavin (1967). ''Ninety Years of Family Farming: The Story of Lord Rayleigh's and Strutt &amp; Parker Farms''. Hutchinson, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He held an interest in [[parapsychology]] and was an early member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR). He was not convinced of [[spiritualism]] but remained open to the possibility of [[supernatural]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;DeYoung, Ursula. (2011). ''A Vision of Modern Science: John Tyndall and the Role of the Scientist in Victorian Culture''. Palgrave Macmillan. p. 178. {{ISBN|978-0-230-11053-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rayleigh was the president of the SPR in 1919. He gave a presidential address the year of his death but did not come to any definite conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Renee Haynes|Haynes, Renee]]. (1982). ''The Society for Psychical Research 1882–1982: A History''. London: MacDonald &amp; Co. p. 198. {{ISBN|978-0356078755}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Robert Bruce. (1970).

Lord Rayleigh was among the original recipients of the [[Order of Merit]] (OM) in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list published on 26 June 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Coronation Honours |day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36804| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and received the order from King [[Edward VII]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 8 August 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular |day_of_week=Saturday |date=9 August 1902 |page_number=6 |issue=36842| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27470|page=5679|date=2 September 1902|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received the degree of ''Doctor mathematicae ([[honoris causa]])'' from the [[Royal Frederick University]] on 6 September 1902, when they celebrated the centennial of the birth of [[mathematician]] [[Niels Henrik Abel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Foreign degrees for British men of Science |day_of_week=Monday |date=8 September 1902 |page_number=4 |issue=36867| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uio.no/om/tall-og-fakta/aresdoktorer/tidligere-aresdoktorer/1902-1910/ |title=Honorary doctorates from the University of Oslo 1902-1910}} ''(in Norwegian)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[William Ramsay]], his co-worker in the investigation to discover [[Argon]] described Rayleigh as "the greatest man alive" while speaking to Lady Ramsay during his last illness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ninety Years of Family Farming|last=Gavin|first=Sir William|publisher=Hutchinson of London|year=1967|isbn=|location=|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Hyndman|H. M. Hyndmann]] said of Rayleigh that "no man ever showed less consciousness of great genius".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:KL-51.nsa.jpg|thumb|KL-51 on display at the [[National Cryptologic Museum]] in 2005.]]
The '''KL-51''' is an off-line keyboard [[encryption]] system that read and punched [[paper tape]] for use with [[teleprinter]]s. In [[NATO]] it was called '''RACE''' ('''Rapid Automatic Cryptographic Equipment''').

It was developed in the 1970s by a [[Norway|Norwegian]] company, [[Standard Telefon og Kabelfabrik]] (STK). It used digital electronics for encryption instead of rotors, and it may have been the first machine to use software based crypto algorithms. KL-51 is a very robust machine made to military specifications.

U.S. [[National Security Agency]] bought it in the 1980s to replace the earlier [[KL-7]]. As of 2006, the U.S. Navy was developing plans to replace KL-51 units still in use with a unit based on a more modern [[Universal Crypto Device]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/descriptivesum/Y2007/Navy/0303140N.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenneth Irwin Gross''' (14 October 1938 – 10 September 2017) was an American mathematician.

Born in [[Malden, Massachusetts]] in 1938,&lt;ref&gt;biographical information ''American Men and Women of Science'', Thomson Gale 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Gross received from [[Brandeis University]] his bachelor's degree in 1960 and his master's degree in 1962. He received his Ph.D. in 1966 from [[Washington University in St. Louis]] under [[Ray Kunze]] with thesis ''Plancherel Transform of the Nilpotent Part of &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; and Some Applications to the Representation Theory of &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=2159}}  {{cite journal|title=Plancherel Transform of the Nilpotent Part of &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; and Some Applications to the Representation Theory of &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;|journal=Trans.

He became in 1973 an associate professor and eventually a full professor at the [[University of North Carolina]] before resigning in 1981. From 1981 to 1985 he was the chair of the mathematics department of the [[University of Wyoming]]. In 1988 Gross became a professor at the [[University of Vermont]], where he served as chair of the department of mathematics and statistics from 1988 to 1992. On a leave of absence he was for two years (2003–2005) at [[Lesley University]], where he developed the mathematics program.

Gross has been a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Irvine]], the [[University of Utah]], the Academia Sinica in Taiwan, [[Drexel University]], [[Macquarie University]], and Australia's [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]]. He has twice served as a divisional program director for the [[National Science Foundation]]. He was the director of the Vermont Mathematics Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uvm.edu/~vmi/ Vermont Mathematics Initiative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510231326/http://www.uvm.edu/~vmi/ |date=2015-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He did research on [[harmonic analysis]], [[group representation theory]], analysis on [[Lie group]]s and [[homogeneous space]]s, [[special function]]s, [[Fourier analysis]], and mathematical applications to physics and [[multivariate statistics]].

In 1979 he received the [[Lester Randolph Ford Award]]. In 1981 he received the [[Chauvenet Prize]] from the [[Mathematical Association of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the Evolution of Noncommutative Harmonic Analysis|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=85|year=1978|pages=525–548|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/on-the-evolution-of-noncommutative-harmonic-analysis-0|doi=10.2307/2320861}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012 he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2015-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt; He died on September 10, 2017 at the age of 78.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/obituary-kenneth-irwin-gross-1938-2017/Content?oid=8059550|title=Obituary: Kenneth Irwin Gross, 1938-2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leo Reino Sario''' (18 May 1916 – 15 August 2009) was a Finnish-born mathematician who worked on [[complex analysis]] and [[Riemann surfaces]].

After service as a Finnish artillery officer in the [[Winter War]] and World War II, he received his PhD in 1948 under [[Rolf Nevanlinna]] at the [[University of Helsinki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=13233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevanlinna and Sario were founding members of the [[Academy of Finland]], and there is a statue on the Academy grounds named after Sario.&lt;ref name=oit&gt;{{cite book|title=Otavan Iso tietosanakirja (Otavan Great Encyclopedia)|publisher=[[Otava (publisher)|Otava]]|year=1966|volume=vol. 7|page=1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sarioucla/&gt; Sario moved to the United States in 1950 and obtained temporary positions at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]],&lt;ref name="sarioias"&gt;[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/5643 Sario, Leo Reino – Institute for Advanced Study Visiting Scholar]&lt;/ref&gt; [[MIT]], [[Stanford University]], and [[Harvard University]]. In 1954 he became a professor at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], remaining there until his retirement in 1986. He was the author or co-author of five major books on complex analysis and over 130 papers. He supervised 36 doctoral students, including Kōtarō Oikawa and [[Burton Rodin]].&lt;ref name=sarioucla/&gt; In 1957 he was awarded the Cross of the Commander of Finland's Order of Knighthood.&lt;ref name=sarioias/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7272">In [[number theory]], a '''multiplicative partition''' or '''unordered factorization''' of an integer ''n'' that is greater than 1 is a way of writing ''n'' as a product of integers greater than 1, treating two products as equivalent if they differ only in the ordering of the factors. The number ''n'' is itself considered one of these products. Multiplicative partitions closely parallel the study of '''multipartite partitions''', discussed in {{harvtxt|Andrews|1976}}, which are additive [[Partition (number theory)|partitions]] of finite sequences of positive integers, with the addition made [[pointwise]]. Although the study of multiplicative partitions has been ongoing since at least 1923, the name "multiplicative partition" appears to have been introduced by {{harvtxt|Hughes|Shallit|1983}}. The Latin name "factorisatio numerorum" had been used previously.  [[MathWorld]] uses the term '''unordered factorization'''.

==Examples==
*The number 20 has four multiplicative partitions: 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;5, 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10, 4&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;5, and 20. 
*3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;3, 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;9, 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;27, 9&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;9, and 81 are the five multiplicative partitions of 81 = 3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. Because it is the fourth power of a [[prime number|prime]], 81 has the same number (five) of multiplicative partitions as 4 does of [[partition (number theory)|additive partitions]].
*The number 30 has five multiplicative partitions: 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;5 = 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;15 = 6&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;5 = 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10 = 30.
*In general, the number of multiplicative partitions of a [[Square-free integer|squarefree]] number with '''i''' prime factors is the ith [[Bell number]], B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Application==
{{harvtxt|Hughes|Shallit|1983}} describe an application of multiplicative partitions in classifying integers with a given number of divisors. For example, the integers with exactly 12 divisors take the forms ''p''&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;, ''p''&amp;times;''q''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''p''&amp;times;''q''&amp;times;''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''p'', ''q'', and ''r'' are distinct [[prime number]]s; these forms correspond to the multiplicative partitions 12, 2&amp;times;6, 3&amp;times;4, and 2&amp;times;2&amp;times;3 respectively. More generally, for each multiplicative partition
:&lt;math&gt;k = \prod t_i&lt;/math&gt;
of the integer ''k'', there corresponds a class of integers having exactly ''k'' divisors, of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\prod p_i^{t_i-1},&lt;/math&gt;
where each ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a distinct prime. This correspondence follows from the [[Multiplicative function|multiplicative]] property of the [[divisor function]].

==Bounds on the number of partitions==
{{harvtxt|Oppenheim|1926}} credits {{harvtxt|McMahon|1923}} with the problem of counting the number of multiplicative partitions of ''n''; this problem has since been studied by other others under the Latin name of ''factorisatio numerorum''. If the number of multiplicative partitions of ''n'' is ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, McMahon and Oppenheim observed that its [[Dirichlet series]] generating function ''f''(''s'') has the product representation

:&lt;math&gt;f(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{a_n}{n^s}=\prod_{k=2}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1-k^{-s}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The sequence of numbers ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' begins

:1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 5, ... {{OEIS|id=A001055}}.

Oppenheim also claimed an upper bound on ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', of the form
:&lt;math&gt;a_n\le n\left(\exp\frac{\log n\log\log\log n}{\log\log n}\right)^{-2+o(1)},&lt;/math&gt;
but as {{harvtxt|Canfield|Erdős|Pomerance|1983}} showed, this bound is erroneous and the true bound is

:&lt;math&gt;a_n\le n\left(\exp\frac{\log n\log\log\log n}{\log\log n}\right)^{-1+o(1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Both of these bounds are not far from linear in ''n'': they are of the form ''n''&lt;sup&gt;1&amp;minus;o(1)&lt;/sup&gt;.
However, the typical value of ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is much smaller: the average value of ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', averaged over an interval ''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''+''N'', is
:&lt;math&gt;\bar a = \exp\left(\frac{4\sqrt{\log N}}{\sqrt{2e}\log\log N}\bigl(1+o(1)\bigr)\right),&lt;/math&gt;
a bound that is of the form ''n''&lt;sup&gt;o(1)&lt;/sup&gt; {{harv|Luca|Mukhopadhyay|Srinivas|2008}}.

==Additional results==
{{harvtxt|Canfield|Erdős|Pomerance|1983}} observe, and {{harvtxt|Luca|Mukhopadhyay|Srinivas|2008}} prove, that most numbers cannot arise as the number ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of multiplicative partitions of some ''n'': the number of values less than ''N'' which arise in this way is ''N''&lt;sup&gt;O(log&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''N''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''N'')&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, {{harvtxt|Luca|Mukhopadhyay|Srinivas|2008}} show that most values of ''n'' are not multiples of ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'': the number of values ''n'' ≤ ''N'' such that ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' divides ''n'' is O(''N''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sup&gt;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;o(1)&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="885">In [[philosophy]], specifically [[metaphysics]], [[mereology]] is the study of parthood relationships. In [[mathematics]] and [[formal logic]], [[wellfoundedness]] prohibits &lt;math&gt;\cdots&lt;x&lt;\cdots&lt;x&lt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt; for any&amp;nbsp;''x''.

Thus '''non-wellfounded mereology''' treats [[topology|topologically]] circular, cyclical, repetitive, or other eventual self-containment.

More formally, non-wellfounded [[partial order]]s may exhibit &lt;math&gt;\cdots&lt;x&lt;\cdots&lt;x&lt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt; for some ''x'' whereas well-founded orders prohibit that.

== Premise ==
''Numberblocks'' follows the adventures of anthropomorphic block characters in Number Land, with the number of blocks determining which numeral they stand for and a tiny black floating number above them to show how many blocks they are made of, which they call a Numberling. When one of the blocks hops on top of another, they transform into a different character to make a new number. The show helps toddlers and young kids learn [[numeracy]] skills, especially how to count and do simple math.

==Characters==
* Zero/0:No blocks. He is just the Numberling 0 with a mouth.
* One/1: A single &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; block. [[Cyclops|She only has one eye, unlike the other Numberblocks]]. She is sweet, fun-loving, curious, bubbly, friendly, and clever. Sometimes she feels self-conscious about only being a single block. She also loves finding things that there are one of. She appears in almost all the episodes.Numberblock 1 said,One!
* Two/2: Two &lt;span style="color:orange;"&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt; blocks. He wears &lt;span style="color:purple;"&gt;purple&lt;/span&gt; glasses, and, starting from his eponymous episode onwards, he wears two sparkling &lt;span style="color:orange;"&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt; dancing shoes. He is very kind and smart, and is One's best friend who loves helping her make pairs, like shoes and socks.Numberblock 2 said,One,Two!
* Three/3: Three &lt;span style="color:yellow;"&gt;{{highlight|yellow|black}}&lt;/span&gt; blocks. She resembels a jester, wearing a crown with three points, and three &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; juggling balls down her front. She is happy-go-lucky, and loves to entertain and juggle. Her catchphrase is "Look at me!".Numberblock 3 said,One,Two,Three!
* Four/4: Four &lt;span style="color:limegreen;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; blocks, usually oriented in a 2 by 2 square, but sometimes four blocks high or arranged like [[Tetris]] blocks. He has square-shaped eyes square-shaped eyebrows, and an upper-overbite. He is happy-go-lucky, sweet, kind-hearted, and friendly. He loves being a square and finding things which are square.Numberblock 4 said,One,Two,Three,Four!and so he likes Four in BFB.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2833">In [[Euclidean geometry]], '''oblique reflections''' generalize ordinary [[reflection (mathematics)|reflections]] by not requiring that reflection be done using [[perpendicular]]s. If two points are oblique reflections of each other, they will still stay so under [[affine transformation]]s. 

Consider a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] ''P'' in the three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. The usual reflection of a point ''A'' in space in respect to the plane ''P'' is another point ''B'' in space, such that the midpoint of the segment ''AB'' is in the plane, and ''AB'' is perpendicular to the plane. For an ''oblique reflection'', one requires instead of perpendicularity that ''AB'' be parallel to a given reference line.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Geometric Transformations for 3D Modeling|edition=2nd|first=Michael E.|last=Mortenson|publisher=Industrial Press|year=2007|isbn=9780831192419|page=211|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D8GjBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally, let there be a plane ''P'' in the three-dimensional space, and a line ''L'' in space not parallel to ''P''. To obtain the oblique reflection of a point ''A'' in space in respect to the plane ''P'', one draws through ''A'' a line parallel to ''L'', and lets the oblique reflection of ''A'' be the point ''B'' on that line on the other side of the plane such that the midpoint of ''AB'' is in ''P''. If the reference line ''L'' is perpendicular to the plane, one obtains the usual reflection. 

For example, consider the plane ''P'' to be the ''xy'' plane, that is, the plane given by the equation ''z''=0 in [[Cartesian coordinates]]. Let the direction of the reference line ''L'' be given by the vector (''a'', ''b'', ''c''), with ''c''≠0 (that is, ''L'' is not parallel to ''P''). The oblique reflection of a point (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') will then be
:&lt;math&gt;\left(x-\frac{2za}{c}, y-\frac{2zb}{c}, -z\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The concept of oblique reflection is easily generalizable to oblique reflection in respect to an affine hyperplane in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with a line again serving as a reference, or even more generally, oblique reflection in respect to a ''k''-dimensional affine subspace, with a ''n''&amp;minus;''k''-dimensional affine subspace serving as a reference. Back to three dimensions, one can then define oblique reflection in respect to a line, with a plane serving as a reference. 

An oblique reflection is an [[affine transformation]], and it is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]], meaning that the reflection of the reflection of a point is the point itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Transformation geometry|first=Jagat Narain|last=Kapur|publisher=Affiliated East-West Press Pvt.|year=1976|page=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4419">In [[mathematics]], especially [[order theory]], a '''prefix ordered set''' generalizes the intuitive concept of a [[Tree (set theory)|tree]] by introducing the possibility of continuous progress and continuous branching. Natural prefix orders often occur when considering [[dynamical systems]] as a set of functions from ''time'' (a [[totally ordered set]]) to some [[phase space]]. In this case, the elements of the set are usually referred to as ''executions'' of the system.

The name ''prefix order'' stems from the prefix order on words, which is a special kind of [[substring]] relation and, because of its discrete character, a tree.

== Formal definition ==

A '''prefix order''' is a [[binary relation]] "≤" over  a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''P'' which is [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], [[transitive relation|transitive]], [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], and '''downward total''', i.e., for all ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' in ''P'', we have that:

*''a ≤ a'' (reflexivity);
*if ''a ≤ b'' and ''b ≤ a'' then ''a'' = ''b'' (antisymmetry);
*if ''a ≤ b'' and ''b ≤ c'' then ''a ≤ c'' (transitivity);
*if ''a ≤ c'' and ''b ≤ c'' then ''a ≤ b'' or ''b ≤ a'' (downward totality).

== Functions between prefix orders ==

While between partial orders it is usual to consider [[order-preserving function]]s, the most important type of functions between prefix orders are so-called '''history preserving''' functions. Given a prefix ordered set ''P'', a '''history''' of a point ''p∈P'' is the (by definition totally ordered) set ''p- ≜ {q | q ≤ p}''. A function ''f : P → Q'' between prefix orders P and Q is then '''history preserving''' if and only if for every ''p∈P'' we find ''f(p-) = f(p)-''. Similarly, a '''future''' of a point ''p∈P'' is the (prefix ordered) set ''p+ ≜ {q | p ≤ q}'' and ''f'' is future preserving if for all ''p∈P'' we find ''f(p+) = f(p)+''.

Every history preserving function and every future preserving function is also order preserving, but not vice versa.
In the theory of dynamical systems, history preserving maps capture the intuition that the behavior in one system is a ''refinement'' of the behavior in another. Furthermore, functions that are history and future preserving [[surjective function|surjections]] capture the notion of [[bisimulation]] between systems, and thus the intuition that a given refinement is ''correct'' with respect to a specification.

The [[range (mathematics)|range]] of a history preserving function is always a [[prefix closed]] subset, where a subset ''S ⊆ P'' is '''prefix closed''' if for all ''s,t ∈ P'' with ''t∈S'' and ''s≤t'' we find ''s∈S''.

== Product and union ==

Taking history preserving maps as ''morphisms'' in the [[category theory|category]] of prefix orders leads to a notion of product that is ''not'' the Cartesian product of the two orders since the Cartesian product is not always a prefix order. Instead, it leads to an ''arbitrary interleaving'' of the original prefix orders. The union of two prefix orders is the [[disjoint union]], as it is with partial orders.

== Isomorphism ==

Any bijective history preserving function is an [[order isomorphism]]. Furthermore, if for a given prefix ordered set ''P'' we construct the set ''P- ≜ { p- | p∈ P}'' we find that this set is prefix ordered by the subset relation ⊆, and furthermore, that the function ''max : P- → P'' is an isomorphism, where ''max(S)'' returns for each set ''S∈P-'' the maximum element in terms of the order on P (i.e. ''max(p-) ≜ p'').

The red prolate spheroid (stretched sphere) corresponds to ''μ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and the blue two-sheet [[hyperboloid]] corresponds to ''ν''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;45°.  The yellow half-plane corresponds to ''φ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−60°, which is measured relative to the ''x''-axis (highlighted in green).  The black sphere represents the intersection point of the three surfaces, which has [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] of roughly&amp;nbsp;(0.831,&amp;nbsp;−1.439,&amp;nbsp;2.182).]]

'''Prolate spheroidal coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] that results from rotating the two-dimensional [[elliptic coordinates|elliptic coordinate system]] about the focal axis of the ellipse, i.e., the symmetry axis on which the foci are located.  Rotation about the other axis produces [[oblate spheroidal coordinates]].  Prolate spheroidal coordinates can also be considered as a [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of [[ellipsoidal coordinates]] in which the two smallest [[ellipsoid|principal axes]] are equal in length.

Prolate spheroidal coordinates can be used to solve various [[partial differential equation]]s in which the boundary conditions match its symmetry and shape, such as solving for a field produced by two centers, which are taken as the foci on the ''z''-axis.  One example is solving for the [[wavefunction]] of an [[electron]] moving in the [[electromagnetic field]] of two positively charged [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], as in the [[hydrogen molecular ion]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Another example is solving for the [[electric field]] generated by two small [[electrode]] tips.  Other limiting cases include areas generated by a line segment (''&amp;mu;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) or a line with a missing segment (&amp;nu;=0).

==Definition==
[[File:ProlateSpheroidCoord.png|thumb|360 px|right|Prolate spheroidal coordinates ''&amp;mu;'' and ''&amp;nu;'' for ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. The lines of equal values of &amp;mu; and &amp;nu; are shown on the ''xz''-plane, i.e. for ''&amp;phi;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The surfaces of constant ''&amp;mu;'' and ''&amp;nu;'' are obtained by rotation about the ''z''-axis, so that the diagram is valid for any plane containing the ''z''-axis: i.e. for any ''&amp;phi;''.]]

The most common definition of prolate spheroidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a \sinh \mu \sin \nu \cos \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a \sinh \mu \sin \nu \sin \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = a \cosh \mu \cos \nu
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a nonnegative real number and &lt;math&gt;\nu \in [0, \pi]&lt;/math&gt;. The azimuthal angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the interval &lt;math&gt;[0, 2\pi]&lt;/math&gt;.

The trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{z^2}{a^2 \cosh^2 \mu} + \frac{x^2 + y^2}{a^2 \sinh^2 \mu} = \cos^2 \nu + \sin^2 \nu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

shows that surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; form [[prolate]] [[spheroid]]s, since they are [[ellipse]]s rotated about the axis 
joining their foci. Similarly, the hyperbolic trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{z^2}{a^2 \cos^2 \nu} - \frac{x^2 + y^2}{a^2 \sin^2 \nu} = \cosh^2 \mu - \sinh^2 \mu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

shows that surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; form 
[[hyperboloid]]s of revolution.

The distances from the foci located at &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z) = (0, 0, \pm a)&lt;/math&gt; are

:&lt;math&gt;
r_\pm = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z \mp a)^2} = a(\cosh \mu \mp \cos \nu).
&lt;/math&gt;

==Scale factors==

The scale factors for the elliptic coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu)&lt;/math&gt; are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\mu = h_\nu = a\sqrt{\sinh^2\mu + \sin^2\nu}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the azimuthal scale factor equals

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\varphi = a \sinh\mu \sin\nu
&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, an infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^3 \sinh\mu \sin\nu ( \sinh^2 \mu + \sin^2 \nu) \, d\mu \, d\nu \, d\varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian can be written

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla^2 \Phi = {} &amp; \frac{1}{a^2 (\sinh^2 \mu + \sin^2 \nu)} 
\left[ \frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \mu^2} + 
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \nu^2} + 
\coth \mu \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \mu} + 
\cot \nu \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \nu}
\right] \\[6pt]
&amp; {} + \frac{1}{a^2 \sinh^2 \mu \sin^2\nu}
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \varphi^2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Alternative definition==

[[File:Prolate spheroidal coordinates degenerate.png|thumb|right|250px|In principle, a definition of prolate spheroidal coordinates could be degenerate.  In other words, a single set of coordinates might correspond to two points in [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]]; this is illustrated here with two black spheres, one on each sheet of the hyperboloid and located at (''x'', ''y'', ±''z'').  However, neither of the definitions presented here are degenerate.]]

An alternative and geometrically intuitive set of prolate spheroidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes used, 
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \cosh \mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau = \cos \nu&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, the curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are prolate spheroids, whereas the curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are hyperboloids of revolution.  The coordinate &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the interval [−1,&amp;nbsp;1], whereas the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; coordinate must be greater than or equal to one.
 
The coordinates &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; have a simple relation to the distances to the foci &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  For any point in the plane, the ''sum'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}+d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; of its distances to the foci equals &lt;math&gt;2a\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, whereas their ''difference'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}-d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;2a\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the distance to &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma+\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the distance to &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma-\tau)&lt;/math&gt;.  (Recall that &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; are located at &lt;math&gt;z=-a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z=+a&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.) This gives the following expressions for &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma = \frac 1 {2a} \left(\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z+a)^2}+\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z-a)^2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\tau = \frac 1 {2a} \left(\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z+a)^2}-\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z-a)^2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\varphi = \arctan\left(\frac y x \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike the analogous [[oblate spheroidal coordinates]], the prolate spheroid coordinates (σ, τ, φ) are ''not'' degenerate; in other words, there is a [[1-to-1 mapping|unique, reversible correspondence]] between them and the [[Cartesian coordinates]]

:&lt;math&gt;
x  = a \sqrt{(\sigma^2 - 1) (1 - \tau^2)} \cos \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y  = a \sqrt{(\sigma^2 - 1) (1 - \tau^2)} \sin \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = a\ \sigma\ \tau
&lt;/math&gt;

==Alternative scale factors==

The scale factors for the alternative elliptic coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; are

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\sigma} = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{2} - \tau^{2}}{\sigma^{2} - 1}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\tau} = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{2} - \tau^{2}}{1 - \tau^{2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

while the azimuthal scale factor is now

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\varphi = a \sqrt{\left( \sigma^{2} - 1 \right) \left( 1 - \tau^{2} \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the infinitesimal volume element becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^3 (\sigma^2 - \tau^2) \, d\sigma \, d\tau \, d\varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian equals

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla^2 \Phi = {} &amp; 
\frac{1}{a^2 (\sigma^2 - \tau^2)}
\left\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma} \left[
\left( \sigma^2 - 1 \right) \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \sigma}
\right] + \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} \left[ 
(1 - \tau^2) \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \tau}
\right]
\right\} \\
&amp; {} + \frac{1}{a^2 (\sigma^2 - 1) (1 - \tau^2)}
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \varphi^2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting  the scale factors into the general formulae  found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

As is the case with [[spherical coordinates]], Laplace's equation may be solved by the method of [[separation of variables]] to yield solutions in the form of '''prolate spheroidal harmonics''', which are convenient to use when boundary conditions are defined on a surface with a constant prolate spheroidal coordinate (See Smythe, 1968).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10198">{{short description|An abstract model of quantum computation}}
A '''quantum cellular automaton''' ('''QCA''') is an abstract model of [[quantum computation]], devised in analogy to conventional models of [[cellular automata]] introduced by [[von Neumann]]. The same name may also refer to [[quantum dot cellular automata]], which are a proposed physical implementation of "classical" cellular automata by exploiting [[quantum mechanical]] phenomena. QCA have attracted a lot of attention as a result of its extremely small feature size (at the molecular or even atomic scale) and its ultra-low power consumption, making it one candidate for replacing [[CMOS]] technology.

== Usage of the term ==
In the context of models of computation or of physical systems, ''quantum cellular automaton'' refers to the merger of elements of both (1)&amp;nbsp;the study of cellular automata in conventional [[computer science]] and (2)&amp;nbsp;the study of [[quantum information processing]]. In particular, the following are features of models of quantum cellular automata:
* The computation is considered to come about by parallel operation of multiple computing devices, or '''cells'''. The cells are usually taken to be identical, finite-dimensional quantum systems (e.g. each cell is a [[qubit]]).
* Each cell has a neighborhood of other cells. Altogether these form a network of cells, which is usually taken to be regular (e.g. the cells are arranged as a lattice with or without periodic boundary conditions).
* The evolution of all of the cells has a number of physics-like symmetries. Locality is one: the next state of a cell depends only on its current state and that of its neighbours. Homogeneity is another: the evolution acts the same everywhere, and is independent of time.
* The state space of the cells, and the operations performed on them, should be motivated by principles of quantum mechanics.
Another feature that is often considered important for a model of quantum cellular automata is that it should be [[universal computation|universal]] for quantum computation (i.e. that it can efficiently simulate [[quantum Turing machine]]s,&lt;ref name=WQCA&gt;{{citation

Models which have been proposed recently impose further conditions, e.g. that quantum cellular automata should be reversible and/or locally unitary, and have an easily determined global transition function from the rule for updating individual cells.&lt;ref name=LUQCA/&gt; Recent results show that these properties can be derived axiomatically, from the symmetries of the global evolution.&lt;ref name=SWQCA&gt;B.

== Models ==

===Early proposals===
In 1982, [[Richard Feynman]] suggested an initial approach to quantizing a model of cellular automata.&lt;ref&gt;R. Feynman, "Simulating physics with computers", Int. J. Theor. Phys. '''21''', 1982: pp. 467–488.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, [[David Deutsch]] presented a formal development of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;D. Deutsch, "Quantum theory, the Church-Turing principle and the universal quantum computer" Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A 400 (1985), pp. 97–117.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Gerhard Grössing and [[Anton Zeilinger]] introduced the term "quantum cellular automata" to refer to a model they defined in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;G. Grossing and A. Zeilinger, "Quantum cellular automata", Complex Systems 2 (2), 1988: pp. 197–208 and 611–623.&lt;/ref&gt; although their model had very little in common with the concepts developed by Deutsch and so has not been developed significantly as a model of computation.

===Models of universal quantum computation===
The first formal model of quantum cellular automata to be researched in depth was that introduced by [[John Watrous (computer scientist)|John Watrous]].&lt;ref name=WQCA/&gt; This model was developed further by Wim van Dam,&lt;ref&gt;W. van Dam, "Quantum cellular automata", Master Thesis, Computer Science Nijmegen, Summer 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Christoph Dürr,  Huong LêThanh, and Miklos Santha,&lt;ref&gt;C. Dürr and M. Santha, "A decision procedure for unitary linear quantum cellular automata", [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9604007 quant-ph/9604007 ].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Dürr, H. LêTanh, M. Santha, "A decision procedure for well-formed linear quantum cellular automata", Rand. Struct. Algorithms 11, 1997: pp. 381–394. See also  [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/cs.DS/9906024 cs.DS/9906024].&lt;/ref&gt; Jozef Gruska.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gruska, "Quantum Computing", McGraw-Hill, Cambridge 1999: Section 4.3.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pablo Arrighi.&lt;ref name=AQCA&gt;Pablo Arrighi, An algebraic study of unitary one dimensional quantum cellular automata, Proceedings of MFCS 2006, LNCS 4162, (2006), pp122-133. See also [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0512040 quant-ph/0512040]&lt;/ref&gt;  However it was later realised that this definition was too loose, in the sense that some instances of it allow superluminal signalling.&lt;ref name=SWQCA/&gt;&lt;ref name=ANWQCA1/&gt; A second wave of models includes those of Susanne Richter and Reinhard Werner,&lt;ref&gt;S. Richter and R.F. Werner, "Ergodicity of quantum cellular automata", J. Stat. Phys. 82, 1996: pp. 963–998. See also  [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9504001 cond-mat/9504001]&lt;/ref&gt; of Benjamin Schumacher and Reinhard Werner,&lt;ref name=SWQCA/&gt; of Carlos Pérez-Delgado and Donny Cheung,&lt;ref name=LUQCA/&gt; and of Pablo Arrighi, Vincent Nesme and Reinhard Werner.&lt;ref name=ANWQCA1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ANWQCA2/&gt; These are all closely related, and do not suffer any such locality issue. In the end one can say that they all agree to picture quantum cellular automata as just some large quantum circuit, infinitely repeating across time and space.

===Models of physical systems===
Models of quantum cellular automata have been proposed by David Meyer,&lt;ref&gt;D. Meyer, "From quantum cellular automata to quantum lattice gases", Journal of Statistical Physics 85, 1996: pp. 551–574.

Chophard and M. Droz, "Cellular Automata modeling of Physical Systems", Cambridge University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Criteria determining when a quantum cellular automaton (QCA) can be described as quantum lattice gas automaton (QLGA) were given by Asif Shakeel and Peter Love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = When is a quantum cellular automaton (QCA) a quantum lattice gas automaton (QLGA)?|url = http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jmp/54/9/10.1063/1.4821640|journal = Journal of Mathematical Physics|date = 2013-09-01|issn = 0022-2488|pages = 092203|volume = 54|issue = 9|doi = 10.1063/1.4821640|first = Asif|last = Shakeel|first2 = Peter J.|last2 = Love|arxiv = 1209.5367 |bibcode = 2013JMP....54i2203S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum dot cellular automata===
A proposal for implementing ''classical'' cellular automata by systems designed with [[quantum dots]] has been proposed under the name "quantum cellular automata" by [[Paul Douglas Tougaw|Doug Tougaw]] and Craig Lent,&lt;ref&gt;P. Tougaw, C. Lent, "Logical devices implemented using quantum cellular automata", J. Appl. Phys. 75, 1994: pp. 1818–1825&lt;/ref&gt; as a replacement for classical computation using CMOS technology. In order to better differentiate between this proposal and models of cellular automata which perform quantum computation, many authors working on this subject now refer to this as a [[quantum dot cellular automaton]].

The '''radiation law''' is way of modeling human mobility ([[geographic mobility]], [[human migration]]) and it gives better empirical predictions than the [[gravity model of migration]] which is widely used in this subject.&lt;ref name=simini&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simini|first=Filippo |author2=Marta C. Gonzales |author3=Amos Maritan |author4=Albert-László Barabási|title=A universal model for mobility and migration patterns|journal=Nature|year=2012|volume=484|series=7392|pages=96–100|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1111/1111.0586.pdf|doi=10.1038/nature10856 |pmid=22367540|arxiv=1111.0586|bibcode=2012Natur.484...96S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intercity mobility==

[[migration pattern|Waves of migration]] due to [[displaced person|displacement by war]], or exploitation in the hope of geographical discoveries could be observed in the past, however with new technological advancements in [[transportation]] keep making it easier and cheaper to get to one place from another. With [[intercontinental flight]]s we even can travel to another continent, on a business trip for instance, and come back within a few hours. Not only time but [[road network]]s and flight networks are being used more and more intensively also, and there is an increasing need to describe the patterns of human peoples' mobility and their effect on [[network theory|network usage]], whether the network is a transportation, communication or some other type of network.

==The radiation model&lt;ref name=simini/&gt;==

[[Radiation]] models appeared first in physics to study the process of energetic particles or [[Wave propagation|waves travel]] through vacuum. The model in the [[social science]] describes the flows of people between different locations. Daily [[commuting]] is the major part of the flows, so modeling job seeking has to be an important part of the model and so it is in the radiation model. People look for jobs in every county starting with their own home county. The number of open jobs &lt;math&gt; n_\text{jobs} &lt;/math&gt; depends on the size of the resident population &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;. The potential employment opportunity (e.g. conditions, income, working hour, etc.) is &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; with the distribution of &lt;math&gt;p(z)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, for each county &lt;math&gt;n/n_\text{jobs}&lt;/math&gt; job opportunities are assigned, which are random draws from the &lt;math&gt;p(z)&lt;/math&gt; distribution. 
Individuals then chooses the job which is closest to their home county and provides the highest &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, they take into account the proximity to their home county and the benefits it can provide. This optimization gives the migration flows (called commuting [[flux]]es) between counties across the country. This is analogous to the model in physics that describes the radiation and absorption process, that's why it's called the radiation model. An important feature of the model is that the average flux between two counties does not depend on the benefit distribution, the number of job opportunities and the total number of commuters. The fundamental equation of the radiation model gives the average flux between two counties,

:&lt;math&gt;\langle T_{ij}\rangle = T_i\frac{m_i n_j}{(m_i+s_{ij})(m_i + n_{j} + s_{ij})}.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of commuters from county &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_j&lt;/math&gt; are the population in county &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; respectively, and &lt;math&gt;s_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the total population in the circle centered at &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and touching &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; excluding the source and the destination population. The model is not static as the Gravity model, and has clear implications which can be empirically verified.

===Example===
The population density around [[Utah]] is much lower than around [[Alabama]] and so are the job opportunities, given that the population of the two states is the same. Thus, the fundamental equation implies that people from Utah have to travel further to find suitable jobs on average than people from Alabama, and indeed, this is what the data shows. The Gravity model gives bad predictions both on short and long distance commuting, while the prediction of the Radiation model is close to the census data. Further empirical testing shows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Masucci|first=A. Paolo|title=Gravity vs Radiation Models: On the Importance of Scale and Heterogeneity in Commuting Flows|arxiv=1206.5735|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.88.022812|volume=88|journal=Physical Review E|bibcode=2013PhRvE..88b2812M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that the Radiation model underestimates the flow in case of big cities, but generalizing the fundamental equation the model can give at least as good predictions as the Gravity model.

==Other forms of the radiation model==

In 1971 famed economist [[William Alonso]] produced a working paper that describes a mathematical model of human mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alonso|first=William|title=The System of Intermetropolitan Population Flows|journal=Working Paper No. 155|year=1971|url=http://www.ced.berkeley.edu/~iurdced/publications/wp/155.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that manuscript Alonso remarks: "It is almost as if an urban area were a radioactive body, emitting particles at a steady rate[.]" In addition to many of the same mathematical terms used by Simini et al., Alonso's radiation model includes measures of climate (degree days) and wealth (per capita income) for both the emitting and receiving locales, but only includes the distance between these urban areas as opposed to a radial measure of intervening population density.

==Other models of human mobility==

The most influential model to describe trade patterns, and in a similar way, describe human mobility is the [[gravity model of trade]]. The model predicts, that the migration flow is proportional to the population of the cities/countries, and it is reciprocal in a quadratic order in the distance between them. Although, it is an intuitive description of the flows, and it is used to describe gravitational forces in physics, in terms of migration it does not perform well empirically. Moreover, the model just simply assumes the given functional form without any theoretical background.

'''Reinsurance''' is [[insurance]] that is purchased by an [[insurance company]]. In the classic case, reinsurance allows insurance companies to remain [[Solvency|solvent]] after major claims events, such as major disasters like hurricanes and wildfires. In addition to its basic role in [[risk management]], reinsurance is sometimes used for tax mitigation and other reasons. The company that purchases the reinsurance policy is called a "ceding company"  or "cedent" or "cedant" under most arrangements. The company issuing the reinsurance policy is referred simply as the "reinsurer".

A company that purchases reinsurance pays a premium to the reinsurance company, who in exchange would pay a share of the claims incurred by the purchasing company. The reinsurer may be either a specialist reinsurance company, which only undertakes reinsurance business, or another insurance company. Insurance companies that sell reinsurance refer to the business as 'assumed reinsurance'.

There are two basic methods of reinsurance:
# '''Facultative Reinsurance''', which is negotiated separately for each insurance policy that is reinsured. Facultative reinsurance is normally purchased by ceding companies for individual risks not covered, or insufficiently covered, by their reinsurance treaties, for amounts in excess of the monetary limits of their reinsurance treaties and for unusual risks. Underwriting expenses, and in particular personnel costs, are higher for such business because each risk is individually underwritten and administered. However, as they can separately evaluate each risk reinsured, the reinsurer's underwriter can price the contract more accurately to reflect the risks involved. Ultimately, a facultative certificate is issued by the reinsurance company to the ceding company reinsuring that one policy.
# '''Treaty Reinsurance''' means that the ceding company and the reinsurer negotiate and execute a '''reinsurance contract''' under which the reinsurer covers the specified share of all the insurance policies issued by the ceding company which come within the scope of that contract. The reinsurance contract may oblige the reinsurer to accept reinsurance of all contracts within the scope (known as "obligatory" reinsurance), or it may allow the insurer to choose which risks it wants to cede, with the reinsurer obliged to accept such risks (known as "facultative-obligatory" or "fac oblig" reinsurance).

There are two main types of treaty reinsurance, proportional and non-proportional, which are detailed below. Under proportional reinsurance, the reinsurer's share of the risk is defined for each separate policy, while under non-proportional reinsurance the reinsurer's liability is based on the aggregate claims incurred by the ceding office. In the past 30 years there has been a major shift from proportional to non-proportional reinsurance in the [[Property insurance|property]] and [[Casualty insurance|casualty]] fields.

== Functions ==
Almost all insurance companies have a reinsurance program. The ultimate goal of that program is to reduce their exposure to loss by passing part of the risk of loss to a reinsurer or a group of reinsurers.

=== Risk transfer ===
With reinsurance, the ''insurer'' can issue policies with higher limits than would otherwise be allowed, thus being able to take on more risk because some of that risk is now transferred to the re-insurer.

===Income smoothing===
Reinsurance can make an insurance company's results more predictable by absorbing larger losses and reducing the amount of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] needed to provide coverage. The risks are diversified, with the reinsurer bearing some of the loss incurred by the insurance company. The income smoothing comes forward as the losses of the cedant are essentially limited. This fosters stability in claim payouts and caps indemnification costs.

=== Surplus relief ===
Proportional Treaties (or “pro-rata” treaties) provide the cedent with “surplus relief”; surplus relief being the capacity to write more business and/or at larger limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fio/reports-and-notices/Documents/FIO%20-Reinsurance%20Report.pdf|title=The Breadth and Scope of the Global Reinsurance Market and the Critical Role Such Market Plays in Supporting Insurance in the United States|last=|first=|date=December 2014|website=U.S. Department of the Treasury|publisher=FEDERAL INSURANCE OFFICE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY|access-date=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arbitrage ===
The insurance company may be motivated by [[arbitrage]] in purchasing reinsurance coverage at a lower rate than they charge the insured for the underlying risk, whatever the class of insurance.

In general, the reinsurer may be able to cover the risk at a lower premium than the insurer because:
* The reinsurer may have some intrinsic cost advantage due to [[economies of scale]] or some other efficiency.
* Reinsurers may operate under weaker regulation than their clients. This enables them to use less capital to cover any risk, and to make less conservative assumptions when valuing the risk.
* Reinsurers may operate under a more favourable tax regime than their clients.
* Reinsurers will often have better access to underwriting expertise and to claims experience data, enabling them to assess the risk more accurately and reduce the need for contingency margins in pricing the risk
* Even if the regulatory standards are the same, the ''reinsurer'' may be able to hold smaller [[actuarial reserves]] than the cedant if it thinks the premiums charged by the cedant are excessively conservative.
* The reinsurer may have a more diverse portfolio of assets and especially liabilities than the cedant. This may create opportunities for hedging that the cedant could not exploit alone. Depending on the regulations imposed on the reinsurer, this may mean they can hold fewer assets to cover the risk.
* The reinsurer may have a greater risk appetite than the insurer.

=== Reinsurer's expertise ===
The insurance company may want to avail itself of the expertise of a ''reinsurer'', or the reinsurer's ability to set an appropriate premium, in regard to a specific (specialised) risk. The reinsurer will also wish to apply this expertise to the underwriting in order to protect their own interests.

=== Creating a manageable and profitable portfolio of insured risks ===
By choosing a particular type of reinsurance method, the insurance company may be able to create a more balanced and homogeneous portfolio of insured risks. This would lend greater predictability to the portfolio results on net basis (after reinsurance) and would be reflected in income smoothing. While income smoothing is one of the objectives of reinsurance arrangements, the mechanism is by way of balancing the portfolio.

== Types of Reinsurance ==

===Proportional===
Under proportional reinsurance, one or more reinsurers take a stated percentage share of each policy that an insurer issues ("writes"). The reinsurer will then receive that stated percentage of the premiums and will pay the stated percentage of claims. In addition, the reinsurer will allow a "ceding [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]]" to the insurer to cover the costs incurred by the insurer (mainly acquisition and administration).

The arrangement may be "quota share" or "surplus reinsurance" (also known as surplus of line or variable quota share treaty) or a combination of the two. Under a quota share arrangement, a fixed percentage (say 75%) of each insurance policy is reinsured. Under a surplus share arrangement, the ceding company decides on a "retention limit" - say $100,000. The ceding company retains the full amount of each risk, with a maximum of $100,000 per policy or per risk, and the balance of the risk is reinsured.

The ceding company may seek a quota share arrangement for several reasons. First, it may not have sufficient capital to prudently retain all of the business that it can sell. For example, it may only be able to offer a total of $100 million in coverage, but by reinsuring 75% of it, it can sell four times as much.

The ceding company may seek surplus reinsurance to limit the losses it might incur from a small number of large claims as a result of random fluctuations in experience. In a 9 line surplus treaty the reinsurer would then accept up to $900,000 (9 lines). So if the insurance company issues a policy for $100,000, they would keep all of the premiums and losses from that policy. If they issue a $200,000 policy, they would give (cede) half of the premiums and losses to the ''reinsurer'' (1 line each). The maximum automatic underwriting capacity of the cedant would be $1,000,000 in this example. Any policy larger than this would require facultative reinsurance.

===Non-proportional===
Under '''non-proportional reinsurance''' the reinsurer only pays out if the total claims suffered by the insurer in a given period exceed a stated amount, which is called the "retention" or "priority". For instance the insurer may be prepared to accept a total loss up to $1 million, and purchases a layer of reinsurance of $4 million in excess of this $1 million. If a loss of $3 million were then to occur, the insurer would bear $1 million of the loss and would recover $2 million from its reinsurer. In this example, the insurer also retains any excess of loss over $5 million unless it has purchased a further excess layer of reinsurance.

The main forms of non-proportional reinsurance are '''excess of loss''' and '''[[stop-loss insurance|stop loss]]'''.

'''Excess of loss''' reinsurance can have three forms - "'''Per Risk''' XL" (Working XL), "Per Occurrence or Per Event XL" ('''Catastrophe''' or Cat XL), and "'''Aggregate''' XL".

In '''per risk''', the cedant's insurance policy limits are greater than the reinsurance retention. For example, an insurance company might insure [[commercial property]] risks with policy limits up to $10 million, and then buy per risk reinsurance of $5 million in excess of $5 million. In this case a loss of $6 million on that policy will result in the recovery of $1 million from the reinsurer. These contracts usually contain event limits to prevent their misuse as a substitute for Catastrophe XLs.

In '''catastrophe''' excess of loss, the cedant's retention is usually a multiple of the underlying policy limits, and the reinsurance contract usually contains a two risk warranty (i.e. they are designed to protect the cedant against catastrophic events that involve more than one policy, usually very many policies). For example, an insurance company issues homeowners' policies with limits of up to $500,000 and then buys catastrophe reinsurance of $22,000,000 in excess of $3,000,000. In that case, the insurance company would only recover from reinsurers in the event of multiple policy losses in one event (e.g., hurricane, earthquake, flood).

'''Aggregate''' XL affords a frequency protection to the reinsured. For instance if the company retains $1 million net any one vessel, $5 million annual aggregate limit in excess of $5m annual aggregate deductible, the cover would equate to 5 total losses (or more partial losses) in excess of 5 total losses (or more partial losses). Aggregate covers can also be linked to the cedant's gross premium income during a 12-month period, with limit and [[deductible]] expressed as percentages and amounts. Such covers are then known as '''"[[stop-loss insurance|stop loss]]"''' contracts.

===Risks attaching basis===
A basis under which reinsurance is provided for claims arising from policies commencing during the period to which the reinsurance
relates. The ''insurer'' knows there is coverage during the whole policy period even if claims are only discovered or made later on.

All claims from cedant underlying policies incepting during the period of the reinsurance contract are covered even if they occur after the expiration date of the reinsurance contract. Any claims from cedant underlying policies incepting outside the period of the reinsurance contract are not covered even if they occur during the period of the reinsurance contract.

===Losses occurring basis===
A Reinsurance treaty under which all claims occurring during the period of the contract, irrespective of when the underlying policies incepted, are covered. Any losses occurring after the contract expiration date are not covered.

As opposed to claims-made or risks attaching contracts. Insurance coverage is provided for losses occurring in the defined period. This is the usual basis of cover for short tail business.

===Claims-made basis===
A policy which covers all claims reported to an ''insurer'' within the policy period irrespective of when they occurred.

==Contracts==
Most of the above examples concern reinsurance contracts that cover more than one policy (treaty). Reinsurance can also be purchased on a per policy basis, in which case it is known as '''facultative reinsurance'''. Facultative reinsurance can be written on either a quota share or excess of loss basis. Facultative reinsurance contracts are commonly memorialized in relatively brief contracts known as facultative certificates and often are used for large or unusual risks that do not fit within standard reinsurance treaties due to their exclusions. The term of a facultative agreement coincides with the term of the policy. Facultative reinsurance is usually purchased by the insurance underwriter who underwrote the original insurance policy, whereas treaty reinsurance is typically purchased by a senior executive at the insurance company.

Reinsurance treaties can either be written on a "continuous" or "term" basis. A continuous contract has no predetermined end date, but generally either party can give 90 days notice to cancel or amend the treaty. A term agreement has a built-in expiration date. It is common for insurers and reinsurers to have long term relationships that span many years. Reinsurance treaties are typically longer documents than facultative certificates, containing many of their own terms that are distinct from the terms of the direct insurance policies that they reinsure. However, even most reinsurance treaties are relatively short documents considering the number and variety of risks and lines of business that the treaties reinsure and the dollars involved in the transactions. There are not "standard" reinsurance contracts. However, many reinsurance contracts do include some commonly used provisions and provisions imbued with considerable industry common and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Reinsurance Professional's Deskbook A Practical Guide|last = |first = |publisher = Thomson Reuters DRI|year = 2015|isbn = |location = |pages = Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fronting==

Sometimes insurance companies wish to offer insurance in jurisdictions where they are not licensed: for example, an insurer may wish to offer an insurance programme to a multinational company, to cover property and liability risks in many countries around the world. In such situations, the insurance company may find a local insurance company which is authorised in the relevant country, arrange for the local insurer to issue an insurance policy covering the risks in that country, and enter into a reinsurance contract with the local insurer to transfer the risks. In the event of a loss, the policyholder would claim against the local insurer under the local insurance policy, the local insurer would pay the claim and would claim reimbursement under the reinsurance contract. Such an arrangement is called "fronting". Fronting is also sometimes used where an insurance buyer requires its insurers to have a certain financial strength rating and the prospective insurer does not satisfy that requirement: the prospective insurer may be able to persuade another insurer, with the requisite credit rating, to provide the coverage to the insurance buyer, and to take out reinsurance in respect of the risk. An insurer which acts as a "fronting insurer" receives a fronting fee for this service to cover administration and the potential default of the reinsurer. The fronting insurer is taking a risk in such transactions, because it has an obligation to pay its insurance claims even if the reinsurer becomes insolvent and fails to reimburse the claims.

Many reinsurance placements are not placed with a single reinsurer but are shared between a number of reinsurers. For example, a $30,000,000 excess of $20,000,000 layer may be shared by 30 or more reinsurers. The reinsurer who sets the terms (premium and contract conditions) for the reinsurance contract is called the lead reinsurer; the other companies subscribing to the contract are called following reinsurers. Alternatively, one reinsurer can accept the whole of the reinsurance and then retrocede it (pass it on in a further reinsurance arrangement) to other companies.

Using [[Game theory|game-theoretic]] modeling, Professors [[Michael R. Powers]] ([[Temple University]]) and [[Martin Shubik]] ([[Yale University]]) have argued that the number of active reinsurers in a given national market should be approximately equal to the square-root of the number of primary insurers active in the same market.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, M. R. and Shubik, M., 2006, "A 'Square-Root Rule' for Reinsurance," Revista de Contabilidade e Finanças (Review of Accounting and Finance), 17, 5, 101-107.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Econometrics|Econometric analysis]] has provided empirical support for the Powers-Shubik rule.&lt;ref&gt;Venezian, E. C., Viswanathan, K. S., and Jucá, Iana B., 2005, "A 'Square-Root Rule' for Reinsurance?  Evidence from Several National Markets," Journal of Risk Finance, 6, 4, 319-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceding companies often choose their reinsurers with great care as they are exchanging insurance risk for credit risk. Risk managers monitor reinsurers' financial ratings (S&amp;P, A.M. Best, etc.) and aggregated exposures regularly.

Because of the [[governance]] effect insurance/cedent companies can have on society, re insurers can indirectly have societal impact as well, due to reinsurer underwriting and claims philosophies imposed on those underlying carriers which affects how the cedents offer coverage in the market. However, reinsurer governance is voluntarily accepted by cedents via contract to allow cedents the opportunity to rent reinsurer capital to expand cedent market share or limit their risk.&lt;ref&gt;Marcos Antonio Mendoza, "Reinsurance as Governance: Governmental Risk Management Pools as a Case Study in the Governance Role Played by Reinsurance Institutions", 21 Conn. Ins. L.J. 53, 68-70, 129 (2014) http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2573253&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">In [[solid mechanics]], it is common to analyze the properties of [[Beam (structure)|beams]] with constant cross section. '''Saint-Venant's theorem'''  states that the [[simply connected]] cross section with maximal [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]]al [[Rigidity (mathematics)|rigidity]] is a circle.&lt;ref name="Makai"&gt;E. Makai, A proof of Saint-Venant's theorem on torsional rigidity, Acta Mathematica Hungarica, Volume 17, Numbers 3&amp;ndash;4 / September, 419&amp;ndash;422,1966{{DOI|10.1007/BF01894885}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after the French mathematician [[Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant]].

Given a [[simply connected]]  domain ''D'' in the plane with area ''A'', &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; the radius and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; the area of its greatest inscribed circle, the torsional rigidity ''P'' 
of ''D'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; P= 4\sup_f \frac{\left( \iint\limits_D f\, dx\, dy\right)^2}{\iint\limits_D {f_x}^2+{f_y}^2\, dx\, dy}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the [[supremum]] is taken over all the continuously differentiable functions vanishing on the boundary of ''D''. The existence of this supremum is a consequence of [[Poincaré inequality]].

Saint-Venant&lt;ref&gt;A J-C Barre de Saint-Venant,popularly known as संत वनंत Mémoire sur la torsion des prismes, Mémoires présentés par divers savants à l'Académie des Sciences, 14 (1856), pp. 233&amp;ndash;560.&lt;/ref&gt; conjectured in 1856 that
of all domains ''D'' of equal area ''A'' the circular one has the greatest torsional rigidity, that is

:&lt;math&gt; P \le P_{\text{circle}} \le \frac{A^2}{2 \pi}.&lt;/math&gt; 

A rigorous proof of this inequality was not given until  1948 by [[George Pólya|Pólya]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Pólya, Torsional rigidity, principal frequency, electrostatic capacity and symmetrization, Quarterly of Applied Math., 6 (1948), pp. 267, 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Another proof was given by [[Harold Davenport|Davenport]] and reported in.&lt;ref&gt;G. Pólya and G. Szegő, Isoperimetric inequalities in Mathematical Physics (Princeton Univ.Press, 1951).&lt;/ref&gt;  A more general proof and an estimate 
:&lt;math&gt;P&lt; 4 \rho^2 A&lt;/math&gt;

is given by Makai.&lt;ref name="Makai"/&gt;

In [[number theory]], '''Selberg's identity''' is an approximate identity involving logarithms of primes found by {{harvs|txt|last=Selberg|authorlink=Atle Selberg|year=1949}}. [[Atle Selberg|Selberg]] and [[Paul Erdős|Erdős]] both used this identity to give elementary proofs of the [[prime number theorem]].

==Statement==

There are several different but equivalent forms of Selberg's identity. One form is
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{p&lt;x}(\log p)^2 +\sum_{pq&lt;x}\log p \log q = 2x\log x +O(x)&lt;/math&gt;
where the sums are over primes ''p'' and ''q''.

==Explanation==

The strange-looking expression on the left side of Selberg's identity is (up to smaller terms) the sum 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n&lt;x} c_n&lt;/math&gt;
where the numbers 
:&lt;math&gt;c_n = \Lambda(n)\log n +\sum_{d|n}\Lambda(d)\Lambda(n/d)&lt;/math&gt; 
are the coefficients of the [[Dirichlet series]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\zeta^{\prime \prime}(s)}{\zeta(s)}=\left(\frac{\zeta^{\prime }(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right)^\prime +\left(\frac{\zeta^{\prime }(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right)^2=\sum \frac{c_n}{n^s}&lt;/math&gt;.

This function has a [[Zeros and poles|pole]] of order 2 at ''s''=1 with coefficient 2, which gives the dominant term 2''x'' log(''x'') in the [[asymptotic expansion]] of &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n&lt;x} c_n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Another variation of the identity==

'''Selberg's identity''' sometimes also refers to the following divisor sum identity involving the [[von Mangoldt function]] and the [[Möbius function]] when &lt;math&gt;n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Apostol|first1=T.|title=Introduction to Analytic Number Theory|date=1976|publisher=Springer|location=New Yorl|isbn=0-387-90163-9|page=46 (Section 2.19)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda \log(n) + \sum_{d|n} \Lambda(d) \Lambda\left(\frac{n}{d}\right) = \sum_{d|n} \mu(d) \log^2\left(\frac{n}{d}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

This variant of Selberg's identity is proved using the concept of taking derivatives of [[arithmetic functions]] defined by &lt;math&gt;f^{\prime}(n) = f(n) \cdot \log(n)&lt;/math&gt; in Section 2.18 of Apostol's book (see also [https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c2934t37385f2934_selberg_identity  this link]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1945">In [[mathematics]], '''Siegel's theorem on integral points''' is the 1929 result of [[Carl Ludwig Siegel]], that for a [[Singular point of an algebraic variety|smooth]] [[algebraic curve]] ''C'' of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] ''g'' defined over a [[number field]] ''K'', presented in [[affine space]] in a given coordinate system, there are only finitely many points on ''C'' with coordinates in the [[ring of integers]] ''O'' of ''K'', provided ''g'' &gt; 0. This result covers the [[Mordell curve]], for example.

This was proved by combining a version of the [[Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem]], from [[diophantine approximation]], with the [[Mordell–Weil theorem]] from [[diophantine geometry]] (required in Weil's version, to apply to the [[Jacobian variety]] of ''C''). It was the first major result on diophantine equations that depended only on the genus, not any special algebraic form of the equations. For ''g'' &gt; 1 it was in the end superseded by [[Faltings's theorem]]. 

Siegel's result was ineffective (see [[effective results in number theory]]), since [[Axel Thue|Thue]]'s method in diophantine approximation also is ineffective in describing possible very good rational approximations to [[algebraic number]]s. Effective results in some cases derive from [[Baker's method]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2455">In [[mathematics]], a nonempty collection of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] is called a '''σ-ring''' (pronounced ''sigma-ring'') if it is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under countable [[union (set theory)|union]] and [[Complement (set theory)|relative complementation]].

==Formal definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a nonempty collection of sets. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a '''σ-ring''' if:
#&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_{n} \in \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;A_{n} \in \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A \setminus B \in \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;A, B \in \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
From these two properties we immediately see that
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \in \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;A_{n} \in \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;

This is simply because &lt;math&gt;\cap_{n=1}^\infty A_n = A_1 \setminus \cup_{n=2}^{\infty}(A_1 \setminus A_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Similar concepts==
If the first property is weakened to closure under finite union (i.e., &lt;math&gt;A \cup B \in \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;A, B \in \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;) but not countable union, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Ring of sets|ring]] but not a σ-ring.

==Uses==
σ-rings can be used instead of [[Sigma-algebra|σ-fields]] (σ-algebras) in the development of [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] and [[Integral|integration]] theory, if one does not wish to require that the [[Universe (mathematics)|universal set]] be measurable. Every σ-field is also a σ-ring, but a σ-ring need not be a σ-field.

A σ-ring &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; that is a collection of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; induces a [[Sigma-algebra|σ-field]] for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; to be the collection of all subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that are elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; or whose complements are elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a σ-field over the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. In fact &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the minimal σ-field containing &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; since it must be contained in every σ-field containing &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7597">In [[logic]], especially [[mathematical logic]], a '''signature''' lists and describes the  [[non-logical symbol]]s of a [[formal language]]. In [[universal algebra]], a signature lists the operations that characterize an [[algebraic structure]]. In [[model theory]], signatures are used for both purposes.

Signatures play the same role in [[mathematics]] as [[type signature]]s in [[computer programming]]. They are rarely made explicit in more philosophical treatments of logic.

== Definition ==

Formally, a (single-sorted) '''signature''' can be defined as a triple σ = (''S''&lt;sub&gt;func&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt;, ar), where ''S''&lt;sub&gt;func&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt; are disjoint sets not containing any other basic logical symbols, called respectively
* ''function symbols'' (examples: +, &amp;times;, 0, 1) and
* ''relation symbols''  or ''predicates'' (examples: ≤, ∈),
and  a function ar: ''S''&lt;sub&gt;func&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt; → &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt; which assigns a natural number called ''[[arity]]'' to every function or relation symbol. A function or relation symbol is called ''n''-ary if its arity is ''n''. A nullary (''0''-ary) function symbol is called a ''constant symbol''.
  
A signature with no function symbols is called a '''relational signature''', and a signature with no relation symbols is called an '''algebraic signature'''. A '''finite signature''' is a signature such that ''S''&lt;sub&gt;func&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt; are finite. More generally, the '''cardinality''' of a signature σ = (''S''&lt;sub&gt;func&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt;, ar) is defined as |σ| = |''S''&lt;sub&gt;func&lt;/sub&gt;| + |''S''&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt;|.

The '''language of a signature''' is the set of all well formed sentences built from the symbols in that signature together with the symbols in the logical system.

== Other conventions ==

In universal algebra the word '''type''' or '''similarity type''' is often used as a synonym for "signature". In model theory, a signature σ is often called a '''vocabulary''', or identified with the [[first-order language|(first-order) language]] ''L'' to which it provides the [[non-logical symbols]]. However, the [[cardinality]] of the language ''L'' will always be infinite; if &amp;sigma; is finite then |L| will be [[Aleph-naught|&amp;alefsym;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]].

As the formal definition is inconvenient for everyday use, the definition of a specific signature is often abbreviated in an informal way, as in:

:"The standard signature for [[abelian group]]s is σ = (+,−,0), where − is a unary operator."

Sometimes an algebraic signature is regarded as just a list of arities, as in:

:"The similarity type for abelian groups is σ = (2,1,0)."

Formally this would define the function symbols of the signature as something like ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(nullary), ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(unary) and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(binary), but in reality the usual names are used even in connection with this convention.

In [[mathematical logic]], very often symbols are not allowed to be nullary,{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} so that constant symbols must be treated separately rather than as nullary function symbols. They form a set ''S''&lt;sub&gt;const&lt;/sub&gt; disjoint from ''S''&lt;sub&gt;func&lt;/sub&gt;, on which the arity function ''ar'' is not defined. However, this only serves to complicate matters, especially in proofs by induction over the structure of a formula, where an additional case must be considered. Any nullary relation symbol, which is also not allowed under such a definition, can be emulated by a unary relation symbol together with a sentence expressing that its value is the same for all elements. This translation fails only for empty structures (which are often excluded by convention). If nullary symbols are allowed, then every formula of [[propositional logic]] is also a formula of [[first-order logic]].

== Use of signatures in logic and algebra ==

In the context of [[first-order logic]], the symbols in a signature are also known as the [[non-logical symbols]], because together with the logical symbols they form the underlying alphabet over which two [[formal language]]s are inductively defined: The set of ''terms'' over the signature and the set of (well-formed) ''formulas'' over the signature.

In a [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]], an ''interpretation'' ties the function and relation symbols to mathematical objects that justify their names: The interpretation of an ''n''-ary function symbol ''f'' in a structure '''''A''''' with ''domain'' ''A'' is a function ''f&lt;sup&gt;'''A'''&lt;/sup&gt;'':&amp;nbsp;''A&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''A'', and the interpretation of an ''n''-ary relation symbol is a relation ''R&lt;sup&gt;'''A'''&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''A&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''. Here ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''A'' × ''A'' × ... × ''A'' denotes the ''n''-fold [[cartesian product]] of the domain ''A'' with itself, and so ''f'' is in fact an ''n''-ary function, and ''R'' an ''n''-ary relation.

== Many-sorted signatures ==

For many-sorted logic and for [[structure (mathematical logic)#Many-sorted structures|many-sorted structures]] signatures must encode information about the sorts. The most straightforward way of doing this is via '''symbol types''' that play the role of generalized arities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929131504/http://react.cs.uni-sb.de/%7Ezarba/snow/ch01.pdf Many-Sorted Logic], the first chapter in [https://web.archive.org/web/20081006212815/http://react.cs.uni-sb.de/~zarba/notes.html Lecture notes on Decision Procedures], written by [http://theory.stanford.edu/~zarba/ Calogero G. Zarba].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symbol types ===
Let ''S'' be a set (of sorts) not containing the symbols × or →.

The symbol types over ''S'' are certain words over the alphabet ''S'' &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; {×, →}: the relational symbol types ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × … × ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and the functional symbol types ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × … × ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;→''s&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', for non-negative integers ''n'' and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''s&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; ''S''. (For ''n'' = 0, the expression ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × … × ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the empty word.)

=== Signature ===
A (many-sorted) signature is a triple (''S'', ''P'', type) consisting of
* a set ''S'' of sorts,
* a set ''P'' of symbols, and
* a map type which associates to every symbol in ''P'' a symbol type over ''S''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1756">In mathematics, a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' with an [[Absolute value#Fields|absolute value]] is called '''spherically complete''' if the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of every [[decreasing sequence]] of [[Ball (mathematics)|balls]] (in the sense of the metric induced by the absolute value) is nonempty:
:&lt;math&gt;B_1\supseteq B_2\supseteq \cdots \Rightarrow\bigcap_{n\in {\mathbf N}} B_n\neq \empty.&lt;/math&gt;
The definition can be adapted also to a field ''K'' with a [[Valuation (algebra)|valuation]] ''v'' taking values in an arbitrary ordered abelian group: (''K'',''v'') is spherically complete if every collection of balls that is totally ordered by inclusion has a nonempty intersection.

Spherically complete fields are important in [[archimedean property|nonarchimedean]] [[functional analysis]], since many results analogous to theorems of classical functional analysis require the base field to be spherically complete.

==Examples==
*Any [[locally compact]] field is spherically complete. This includes, in particular, the fields '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; of [[p-adic number]]s, and any of their finite extensions.
*On the other hand, '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[complete metric space|completion]] of the [[algebraic closure]] of '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, is not spherically complete.&lt;ref&gt;Robert, [https://books.google.de/books?id=H6sq_x2-DgoC&amp;PA143 p.&amp;nbsp;143]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8793">In [[mathematical logic]], '''Tarski's high school algebra problem''' was a question posed by [[Alfred Tarski]].  It asks whether there are [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]] involving [[addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[exponentiation]] over the positive integers that cannot be proved using eleven [[axioms]] about these operations that are taught in high-school-level mathematics.  The question was solved in 1980 by [[Alex Wilkie]], who showed that such unprovable identities do exist.

==Statement of the problem==

Tarski considered the following eleven axioms about addition ('+'), multiplication ('·'), and exponentiation to be standard axioms taught in high school:
# ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''
# (''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z'')
# ''x''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''
# ''x''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x''
# (''x''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;(''y''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''z'')
# ''x''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;(''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;·''z''
# 1&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1
# ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''
# ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''z''&lt;/sup&gt;
# (''x''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''y'')&lt;sup&gt;''z''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''z''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;''z''&lt;/sup&gt;
# (''x''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''z''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;/sup&gt;.

These eleven axioms, sometimes called the ''high school identities'',&lt;ref name="BurrisLee"&gt;Stanley Burris, Simon Lee, ''Tarski's high school identities'', [[American Mathematical Monthly]], '''100''', (1993), no.3, pp.231&amp;ndash;236.&lt;/ref&gt; are related to the axioms of an [[Exponential field|exponential ring]].&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking an exponential ring has an exponential function ''E'' that takes each element ''x'' to something that acts like ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; for a fixed number ''a''.  But a slight generalisation gives the axioms listed here.  The lack of axioms about additive inverses means the axioms actually describe an exponential [[Semiring|commutative semiring]].&lt;/ref&gt; Tarski's problem then becomes: are there identities involving only addition, multiplication, and exponentiation, that are true for all positive integers, but that cannot be proved using only the axioms 1&amp;ndash;11?

==Example of a provable identity==

Since the axioms seem to list all the basic facts about the operations in question it is not immediately obvious that there should be anything one can state using only the three operations that is not provably true.  However, proving seemingly innocuous statements can require long proofs using only the above eleven axioms.  Consider the following proof that (''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1:
:(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:=
:(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;
:= { by 9. }
:(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
:=&amp;nbsp;{ by 8. }
:(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)
:=&amp;nbsp;{ by 6. }
:(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;1
:= { by 4. and 3. }
:''x''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1
:= { by 6. and 3. }
:''x''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1
:=&amp;nbsp;{ by 8. and 6. }
:''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1
:= { by 9. }
:''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1
:= { by 4. }
:''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1

Here brackets are omitted when axiom 2. tells us that there is no confusion about grouping.

The length of proofs is not an issue; proofs of similar identities to that above for things like (''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'')&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; would take a lot of lines, but would really involve little more than the above proof.

==History of the problem==

The list of eleven axioms can be found explicitly written down in the works of [[Richard Dedekind]],&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dedekind, ''Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?'', 8te unveränderte Aufl. Friedr. Vieweg &amp; Sohn, Braunschweig (1960). English translation: ''What are numbers and what should they be?'' Revised, edited, and translated from the German by [[H. A. Pogorzelski]], W.
Ryan, and W. Snyder, RIM Monographs in Mathematics, Research Institute for Mathematics, (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; although they were obviously known and used by mathematicians long before then.  Dedekind was the first, though, who seemed to be asking if these axioms were somehow sufficient to tell us everything we could want to know about the integers.  The question was put on a firm footing as a problem in logic and [[model theory]] sometime in the 1960s by Alfred Tarski,&lt;ref name="BurrisLee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gurevic"&gt;R. Gurevič, ''Equational theory of positive numbers with exponentiation'', Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. '''94''' no.1, (1985), pp.135&amp;ndash;141.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 1980s it had become known as Tarski's high school algebra problem.

==Solution==

In 1980 Alex Wilkie proved that not every identity in question can be proved using the axioms above.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Wilkie, ''On exponentiation &amp;ndash; a solution to Tarski's high school algebra problem'', Connections between model theory and algebraic and analytic geometry, Quad. Mat., '''6''', Dept. Math., Seconda Univ. Napoli, Caserta, (2000), pp.107&amp;ndash;129.&lt;/ref&gt; He did this by explicitly finding such an identity.  By introducing new function symbols corresponding to polynomials that map positive numbers to positive numbers he proved this identity, and showed that these functions together with the eleven axioms above were both sufficient and necessary to prove it.  The identity in question is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;\left((1+x)^y+(1+x+x^2)^y\right)^x\cdot\left((1+x^3)^x+(1+x^2+x^4)^x\right)^y\\={}&amp;\left((1+x)^x+(1+x+x^2)^x\right)^y\cdot\left((1+x^3)^y+(1+x^2+x^4)^y\right)^x.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This identity is usually denoted ''W''(''x'',''y'') and is true for all positive integers ''x'' and ''y'', as can be seen by factoring &lt;math&gt;(1-x+x^2)^{xy}&lt;/math&gt; out of the second terms; yet it cannot be proved true using the eleven high school axioms.

Intuitively, the identity cannot be proved because the high school axioms can't be used to discuss the polynomial &lt;math&gt;1-x+x^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Reasoning about that polynomial and the subterm &lt;math&gt;-x&lt;/math&gt; requires a concept of negation or subtraction, and these are not present in the high school axioms.  Lacking this, it is then impossible to use the axioms to manipulate the polynomial and prove true properties about it.  Wilkie's results from his paper show, in more formal language, that the "only gap" in the high school axioms is the inability to manipulate polynomials with negative coefficients.

==Generalisations==

Wilkie proved that there are statements about the positive integers that cannot be proved using the eleven axioms above and showed what extra information is needed before such statements can be proved.  Using [[Nevanlinna theory]] it has also been proved that if one restricts the kinds of exponential one takes then the above eleven axioms are sufficient to prove every true statement.&lt;ref&gt;C. Ward Henson, Lee A. Rubel, ''Some applications of Nevanlinna theory to mathematical logic: Identities of exponential functions'', [[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]], vol.282 '''1''', (1984), pp.1&amp;ndash;32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem stemming from Wilkie's result, which remains open, is that which asks what the smallest [[Algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] is for which ''W''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') is not true but the eleven axioms above are.  In 1985 an algebra with 59 elements was found that satisfied the axioms but for which ''W''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') was false.&lt;ref name="Gurevic"/&gt;  Smaller such algebras have since been found, and it is now known that the smallest such one must have either 11 or 12 elements.&lt;ref&gt;Jian Zhang, ''Computer search for counterexamples to Wilkie's identity'', Automated Deduction – CADE-20, [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] (2005), pp.441&amp;ndash;451, {{doi|10.1007/11532231_32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2578">In [[mathematics]], more specifically [[group theory]], the '''three subgroups lemma''' is a result concerning [[commutator]]s. It is a consequence of the [[Philip Hall]] and [[Ernst Witt]]'s eponymous identity.

==Notation==
In that which follows, the following notation will be employed:

* If ''H'' and ''K'' are subgroups of a group ''G'', the commutator of ''H'' and ''K'', denoted by [''H'',''K''], is defined as the subgroup of ''G'' generated by [[Commutator#Identities_(group_theory)|commutators]] between elements in the two subgroups.  If ''L'' is a third subgroup, the convention that [''H'',''K'',''L''] = [[''H'',''K''],''L''] will be followed.
* If ''x'' and ''y'' are elements of a group ''G'', the [[Conjugate (group theory)|conjugate]] of ''x'' by ''y'' will be denoted by &lt;math&gt;x^{y}&lt;/math&gt;.
* If ''H'' is a subgroup of a group ''G'', then the [[Centralizer and normalizer|centralizer]] of ''H'' in ''G'' will be denoted by '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;(''H'').

== Statement ==
Let ''X'', ''Y'' and ''Z'' be subgroups of a group ''G'', and assume

:&lt;math&gt;[X,Y,Z]=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[Y,Z,X]=1&lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;[Z,X,Y]=1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, Lemma 8.27, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, if &lt;math&gt;N\triangleleft G&lt;/math&gt;, then if &lt;math&gt;[X,Y,Z]\subseteq N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[Y,Z,X]\subseteq N&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;[Z,X,Y]\subseteq N&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, Corollary 8.28, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof and the Hall&amp;ndash;Witt identity==

'''Hall&amp;ndash;Witt identity'''

If &lt;math&gt;x,y,z\in G&lt;/math&gt;, then

: &lt;math&gt;[x, y^{-1}, z]^y\cdot[y, z^{-1}, x]^z\cdot[z, x^{-1}, y]^x = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof of the three subgroups lemma'''

Let &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z\in Z&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;[x,y^{-1},z]=1=[y,z^{-1},x]&lt;/math&gt;, and by the Hall&amp;ndash;Witt identity above, it follows that &lt;math&gt;[z,x^{-1},y]^{x}=1&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;[z,x^{-1},y]=1&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;[z,x^{-1}]\subseteq \bold{C}_G(Y)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in Z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Since these elements generate &lt;math&gt;[Z,X]&lt;/math&gt;, we conclude that &lt;math&gt;[Z,X]\subseteq \bold{C}_G(Y)&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;[Z,X,Y]=1&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''traveling tournament problem (TTP)''' is an [[mathematical optimization]] problem. The question involves scheduling a series of [[sports team|teams]] such that:
#Each team [[Round-robin tournament|plays every other team]] twice, once at [[home team|home]] and once in the other's stadium.
#No team plays the same opponent in two consecutive weeks.
#No team plays more than three games in a row at home, or three games in a row [[visiting team|on the road]].

A [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is provided of the travel distances between each team's home city. All teams start and end at their own home city, and the goal is to minimize the total travel distance for every team over the course of the whole [[Season (sports)|season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mat.gsia.cmu.edu/TOURN/ttp_ipcp.pdf|title=Solving the Traveling Tournament Problem|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many papers published on the subject, and a contest exists to find the best solutions for certain specific schedules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mat.gsia.cmu.edu/TOURN/|title=Challenge Traveling Tournament Problems|website=mat.gsia.cmu.edu|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2344">In [[mathematics]], a [[sequence]] of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s &lt;math&gt;\{f_{n}\}&lt;/math&gt; from a set ''S'' to a metric space ''M'' is said to be '''uniformly Cauchy''' if:

* For all &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;N&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;x\in S&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;d(f_{n}(x), f_{m}(x)) &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;m, n &gt; N&lt;/math&gt;.

Another way of saying this is that &lt;math&gt;d_u (f_{n}, f_{m}) \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;m, n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, where the uniform distance &lt;math&gt;d_u&lt;/math&gt; between two functions is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;d_{u} (f, g) := \sup_{x \in S} d (f(x), g(x)).&lt;/math&gt;

== Convergence criteria ==
A sequence of functions {''f''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;} from ''S'' to ''M'' is '''pointwise''' Cauchy if, for each ''x'' &amp;isin; ''S'', the sequence {''f''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')} is a [[Cauchy sequence]] in ''M''.  This is a weaker condition than being uniformly Cauchy.  

In general a sequence can be pointwise Cauchy and not pointwise convergent, or it can be uniformly Cauchy and not uniformly convergent.  Nevertheless, if the metric space ''M'' is [[complete metric space|complete]], then any pointwise Cauchy sequence converges pointwise to a function from ''S'' to ''M''.  Similarly, any uniformly Cauchy sequence will tend [[uniform convergence|uniformly]] to such a function.

The uniform Cauchy property is frequently used when the ''S'' is not just a set, but a [[topological space]], and ''M'' is a complete metric space.  The following theorem holds:

* Let ''S'' be a topological space and ''M'' a complete metric space.  Then any uniformly Cauchy sequence of [[continuous function]]s ''f''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; : ''S'' &amp;rarr; ''M'' tends [[uniform convergence|uniformly]] to a unique continuous function ''f'' : ''S'' &amp;rarr; ''M''.

== Generalization to uniform spaces ==

A [[sequence]] of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s &lt;math&gt;\{f_{n}\}&lt;/math&gt; from a set ''S'' to a metric space ''U'' is said to be '''uniformly Cauchy''' if:

* For all &lt;math&gt;x\in S&lt;/math&gt; and for any [[Uniform space|entourage]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;N&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(f_{n}(x), f_{m}(x)) &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;m, n &gt; N&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Visual calculus''', invented by [[Mamikon Mnatsakanian]] (known as Mamikon), is an approach to solving a variety of [[Integral|integral calculus]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~mamikon/calculus.html Visual Calculus] Mamikon Mnatsakanian&lt;/ref&gt; Many problems that would otherwise seem quite difficult yield to the method with hardly a line of calculation, often reminiscent of what [[Martin Gardner]] calls "aha! solutions" or Roger Nelsen a [[proof without words]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelsen, Roger B. (1993). ''Proofs without Words'', Cambridge University Press. {{isbn|978-0-88385-700-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gardner (1978) ''Aha! Insight'', W.H. Freeman &amp; Company; {{isbn|0-7167-1017-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Mamikon_annulus_area_visualisation.svg|thumb|upright|Illustration of Mamikon's method showing that the areas of two annuli with the same chord length are the same regardless of inner and outer radii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Edge of the Universe: Celebrating Ten Years of Math Horizons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I9oVP8TlyqIC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Mamikon devised his method in 1959 while an undergraduate, first applying it to a well-known geometry problem: Find the area of a ring ([[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]]), given the length of a chord tangent to the inner circumference. (Perhaps surprisingly, no additional information is needed; the solution does not depend on the ring's inner and outer dimensions.)

The traditional approach involves algebra and application of the Pythagorean theorem. Mamikon's method, however, envisions an alternate construction of the ring: First the inner circle alone is drawn, then a constant-length tangent is made to travel along its circumference, "sweeping out" the ring as it goes.

Now if all the (constant-length) tangents used in constructing the ring are translated so that their points of tangency coincide, the result is a circular disk of known radius (and easily computed area). Indeed, since the inner circle's radius is irrelevant, one could just as well have started with a circle of radius zero (a point)&amp;mdash;and sweeping out a ring around a circle of zero radius is indistinguishable from simply rotating a line segment about one of its endpoints and sweeping out a disk.

Mamikon's insight was to recognize the equivalence of the two constructions; and because they are equivalent, they yield equal areas. Moreover, so long as it is given that the tangent length is constant, the two starting curves need not be circular&amp;mdash;a finding not easily proven by more traditional geometric methods. This yields '''Mamikon's theorem''':
:''The area of a tangent sweep is equal to the area of its tangent cluster, regardless of the shape of the original curve.''

==Applications==
[[Tom M. Apostol|Tom Apostol]] has produced a very readable introduction to the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.caltech.edu/~mamikon/VisualCalc.html A VISUAL Approach to CALCULUS problems] An introduction by Tom Apostol&lt;/ref&gt; In it he shows that the problems of finding the area of a [[cycloid]] and [[tractrix]] can be solved by very young students. "Moreover, the new method also solves some problems ''unsolvable by calculus, and allows many incredible generalizations yet unknown in mathematics''." He also mentions that combining Mamikon's method with the geometric solution yields a new proof of the Pythagorean Theorem. Solutions to many other problems appear on Mamikon's Visual Calculus site.

===Area of a cycloid===
[[File:Mamikon Cycloid.svg|thumb|right|300px|Finding the area of a [[cycloid]] using Mamikon's theorem.]]

The area of a [[cycloid]] can be calculated by considering the area between it and an enclosing rectangle. These tangents can all be clustered to form a circle. If the circle generating the cycloid has radius ''r'' then this circle also has radius ''r'' and area π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The area of the rectangle is &lt;math&gt;2r \times 2 \pi r = 4 \pi r ^2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore the area of the cycloid is &lt;math&gt;3\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;: it is 3 times the area of the generating circle.

The tangent cluster can be seen to be a circle because the cycloid is generated by a circle and the tangent to the cycloid will be at right angle to the line from the generating point to the rolling point. Thus the tangent and the line to the contact point form a right-angled triangle in the generating circle. This means that clustered together the tangents will describe the shape of the generating circle.

In [[mathematics]], '''Voigt notation''' or '''Voigt form''' in [[multilinear algebra]] is a way to represent a [[symmetric tensor]] by reducing its order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few variants and associated names for this idea: '''Mandel notation''', '''Mandel–Voigt notation''' and '''Nye notation''' are others found. '''Kelvin notation''' is a revival by Helbig&lt;ref name="Helbig"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of old ideas of [[Lord Kelvin]]. The differences here lie in certain weights attached to the selected entries of the tensor. Nomenclature may vary according to what is traditional in the field of application.

For example, a 2&amp;times;2 symmetric tensor '''''X''''' has only three distinct elements, the two on the diagonal and the other being off-diagonal. Thus it can be expressed as the vector

:&lt;math&gt;\langle x_{1 1}, x_{2 2}, x_{1 2}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

As another example:

The stress tensor (in matrix notation) is given as
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}=
\left[{\begin{matrix}
  \sigma_{xx} &amp; \sigma_{xy} &amp; \sigma_{xz} \\
  \sigma_{yx} &amp; \sigma_{yy} &amp; \sigma_{yz} \\
  \sigma_{zx} &amp; \sigma_{zy} &amp; \sigma_{zz}
\end{matrix}}\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

In Voigt notation it is simplified to a 6-dimensional vector:
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde\sigma= (\sigma_{xx}, \sigma_{yy}, \sigma_{zz},
  \sigma_{yz},\sigma_{xz},\sigma_{xy}) \equiv (\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3, \sigma_4, \sigma_5, \sigma_6).
&lt;/math&gt;

The strain tensor, similar in nature to the stress tensor—both are symmetric second-order tensors --, is given in matrix form as
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\epsilon}=
\left[{\begin{matrix}
  \epsilon_{xx} &amp; \epsilon_{xy} &amp; \epsilon_{xz} \\
  \epsilon_{yx} &amp; \epsilon_{yy} &amp; \epsilon_{yz} \\
  \epsilon_{zx} &amp; \epsilon_{zy} &amp; \epsilon_{zz}
\end{matrix}}\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

Its representation in Voigt notation is
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde\epsilon= (\epsilon_{xx}, \epsilon_{yy}, \epsilon_{zz},
  \gamma_{yz},\gamma_{xz},\gamma_{xy}) \equiv (\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, \epsilon_3, \epsilon_4, \epsilon_5, \epsilon_6),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{xy}=2\epsilon_{xy}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{yz}=2\epsilon_{yz}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{zx}=2\epsilon_{zx}&lt;/math&gt; are engineering shear strains.

The benefit of using different representations for stress and strain is that the scalar invariance
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldsymbol{\epsilon} = \sigma_{ij}\epsilon_{ij} = \tilde\sigma \cdot \tilde\epsilon
&lt;/math&gt;
is preserved.

Likewise, a three-dimensional symmetric fourth-order tensor can be reduced to a 6&amp;times;6 matrix.

== Mnemonic rule ==
A simple [[Mnemonic|mnemonic rule]] for memorizing Voigt notation is as follows:

* Write down the second order tensor in matrix form (in the example, the stress tensor)
* Strike out the diagonal
* Continue on the third column
* Go back to the first element along the first row.

Voigt indexes are numbered consecutively from the starting point to the end (in the example, the numbers in blue).

[[File:Voigt notation Mnemonic rule.svg|180px]]

==Mandel notation==
For a symmetric tensor of second rank
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\sigma}=
\left[{\begin{matrix}
  \sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{12} &amp; \sigma_{13} \\
  \sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{22} &amp; \sigma_{23} \\
  \sigma_{31} &amp; \sigma_{32} &amp; \sigma_{33}
\end{matrix}}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

only six components are distinct, the three on the diagonal and the others being off-diagonal. 
Thus it can be expressed, in Mandel notation, as the vector
:&lt;math&gt; 
\tilde \sigma ^M=
\langle \sigma_{11}, 
\sigma_{22},
\sigma_{33},
\sqrt 2 \sigma_{23},
\sqrt 2 \sigma_{13},
\sqrt 2 \sigma_{12}
\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

The main advantage of Mandel notation is to allow the use of the same conventional operations used with vectors,
for example:
:&lt;math&gt; \tilde \sigma : \tilde \sigma = \tilde \sigma^M \cdot \tilde \sigma^M = 
\sigma_{11}^2 +
\sigma_{22}^2 +
\sigma_{33}^2 +
2 \sigma_{23}^2 +
2 \sigma_{13}^2 +
2 \sigma_{12}^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

A symmetric tensor of rank four satisfying &lt;math&gt; D_{ijkl} = D_{jikl} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; D_{ijkl} = D_{ijlk} &lt;/math&gt; has 81 components in three-dimensional space, but only 36 
components are distinct. Thus, in Mandel notation, it can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt; \tilde D^M=
\begin{pmatrix}
  D_{1111} &amp; D_{1122} &amp; D_{1133}  &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1123} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1113} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1112} \\
  D_{2211} &amp; D_{2222} &amp; D_{2233}  &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{2223} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{2213} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{2212} \\
  D_{3311} &amp; D_{3322} &amp; D_{3333}  &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{3323} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{3313} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{3312} \\
  \sqrt 2 D_{2311} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{2322} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{2333}  &amp; 2 D_{2323} &amp; 2 D_{2313} &amp; 2 D_{2312} \\
  \sqrt 2 D_{1311} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1322} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1333}  &amp; 2 D_{1323} &amp; 2 D_{1313} &amp; 2 D_{1312} \\
  \sqrt 2 D_{1211} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1222} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1233}  &amp; 2 D_{1223} &amp; 2 D_{1213} &amp; 2 D_{1212} \\
\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
The notation is named after physicist [[Woldemar Voigt]].  It is useful, for example, in calculations involving constitutive models to simulate materials, such as the generalized [[Hooke's law]], as well as [[finite element analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooke's law has a symmetric fourth-order stiffness tensor with 81 components (3&amp;times;3&amp;times;3&amp;times;3), but because the application of such a rank-4 tensor to a symmetric rank-2 tensor must yield another symmetric rank-2 tensor, not all of the 81 elements are independent. Voigt notation enables such a rank-4 tensor to be &lt;i&gt;represented&lt;/i&gt; by a 6&amp;times;6 matrix. However, Voigt's form does not preserve the sum of the squares, which in the case of Hooke's law has geometric significance. This explains why weights are introduced (to make the mapping an [[isometry]]).

A discussion of invariance of Voigt's notation and Mandel's notation be found in Helnwein (2001).&lt;ref name="Helnwein"&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8693">In [[numerical analysis]], '''von Neumann stability analysis''' (also known as Fourier stability analysis) is a procedure used to check the [[Numerical stability|stability]] of [[finite difference scheme]]s as applied to linear [[partial differential equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y77n2ySMJHUC&amp;pg=PA523&amp;dq=von+Neumann+stability+analysis#PPA523,M1 Analysis of Numerical Methods by E. Isaacson, H. B. Keller]&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis is based on the [[Fourier decomposition]] of [[numerical error]] and was developed at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] after having been briefly described in a 1947 article by [[British people|British]] researchers [[John Crank|Crank]] and [[Phyllis Nicolson|Nicolson]].&lt;ref&gt;

This method is an example of [[temporal discretization|explicit time integration]] where the function that defines governing equation is evaluated at the current time.
Later, the method was given a more rigorous treatment in an article&lt;ref&gt;

==Numerical stability==
The [[Numerical stability|stability of numerical schemes]] is closely associated with [[numerical error]]. A finite difference scheme is stable if the errors made at one time step of the calculation do not cause the errors to be magnified as the computations are continued. A ''neutrally stable scheme'' is one in which errors remain constant as the computations are carried forward. If the errors decay and eventually damp out, the numerical scheme is said to be stable. If, on the contrary, the errors grow with time the numerical scheme is said to be unstable. The stability of numerical schemes can be investigated by performing von Neumann stability analysis. For time-dependent problems, stability guarantees that the numerical method produces a bounded solution whenever the solution of the exact differential equation is bounded. Stability, in general, can be difficult to investigate, especially when the equation under consideration is [[nonlinear partial differential equation|nonlinear]].

In certain cases, von Neumann stability is necessary and sufficient for stability in the sense of Lax–Richtmyer (as used in the [[Lax equivalence theorem]]): The PDE and the finite difference scheme models are linear; the PDE is constant-coefficient with [[periodic boundary conditions]] and has only two independent variables; and the scheme uses no more than two time levels.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Neumann stability is necessary in a much wider variety of cases. It is often used in place of a more detailed stability analysis to provide a good guess at the restrictions (if any) on the step sizes used in the scheme because of its relative simplicity.

==Illustration of the method==
The von Neumann method is based on the decomposition of the errors into [[Fourier series]]. To illustrate the procedure, consider the one-dimensional [[heat equation]] 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
defined on the spatial interval &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, which can be discretized&lt;ref&gt;in this case, using the [[FTCS|FTCS discretization scheme]]&lt;/ref&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \quad (1) \qquad u_j^{n + 1} = u_j^{n} + r \left(u_{j + 1}^n - 2 u_j^n + u_{j - 1}^n \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{\alpha\, \Delta t}{\Delta x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
and the solution &lt;math&gt;u_j^{n}&lt;/math&gt; of the discrete equation approximates the analytical solution &lt;math&gt;u(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; of the PDE on the grid.

Define the [[round-off error]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_j^n&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \epsilon_j^n = N_j^n - u_j^n
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;u_j^n&lt;/math&gt; is the solution of the discretized equation (1) that would be computed in the absence of round-off error, and &lt;math&gt;N_j^n&lt;/math&gt; is the numerical solution obtained in [[Floating point|finite precision arithmetic]]. Since the exact solution &lt;math&gt;u_j^n&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy the discretized equation exactly, the error &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_j^n&lt;/math&gt; must also satisfy the discretized equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Computational Fluid Dynamics: The Basics with Applications | author = Anderson, J. D., Jr. | authorlink=John D. Anderson|edition = | publisher = [[McGraw Hill]] | year = 1994 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here we assumed that &lt;math&gt;N_j^n&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the equation, too (this is only true in machine precision).
Thus
:&lt;math&gt;
  \quad (2) \qquad \epsilon_j^{n + 1} = \epsilon_j^n + r \left(\epsilon_{j + 1}^n - 2 \epsilon_j^n + \epsilon_{j - 1}^n \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
is a recurrence relation for the error. Equations (1) and (2) show that both the error and the numerical solution have the same growth or decay behavior with respect to time. For linear differential equations with periodic boundary condition, the spatial variation of error may be expanded in a finite Fourier series, in the interval &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \quad (3) \qquad \epsilon(x) = \sum_{m=1}^{M} A_m e^{ik_m x}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the [[wavenumber]] &lt;math&gt;k_m = \frac{\pi m}{L}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;m = 1,2,\ldots,M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M = L/\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;. The time dependence of the error is included by assuming that the amplitude of error &lt;math&gt;A_m&lt;/math&gt; is a function of time. Since the error tends to grow or decay exponentially with time, it is reasonable to assume that the amplitude varies exponentially with time; hence
:&lt;math&gt;
  \quad (4) \qquad \epsilon(x,t) = \sum_{m=1}^{M} e^{at} e^{ik_m x}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.

Since the difference equation for error is linear (the behavior of each term of the series is the same as series itself), it is enough to consider the growth of error of a typical term:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \quad (5) \qquad \epsilon_m(x,t) = e^{at} e^{ik_m x}
&lt;/math&gt;
The stability characteristics can be studied using just this form for the error with no loss in generality. To find out how error varies in steps of time, substitute equation (5) into equation (2), after noting that
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \epsilon_j^n &amp; = e^{at} e^{ik_m x} \\
 \epsilon_j^{n+1} &amp; = e^{a(t+\Delta t)} e^{ik_m x} \\
 \epsilon_{j+1}^n &amp; = e^{at} e^{ik_m (x+\Delta x)} \\
 \epsilon_{j-1}^n &amp; = e^{at} e^{ik_m (x-\Delta x)},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
to yield (after simplification)
:&lt;math&gt;
  \quad (6) \qquad e^{a\Delta t} = 1 + r \left(e^{ik_m \Delta x} + e^{-ik_m \Delta x} -  2\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the identities
:&lt;math&gt;
  \qquad \sin\left(\frac{k_m \Delta x}{2}\right)= \frac{e^{ik_m \Delta x/2} - e^{-ik_m \Delta x/2}}{2i} \qquad \rightarrow \qquad \sin^2\left(\frac{k_m \Delta x}{2}\right) = -\frac{ e^{ik_m \Delta x} + e^{-ik_m \Delta x} -  2 }{4}
&lt;/math&gt;
equation (6) may be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \quad (7) \qquad e^{a\Delta t} = 1 - 4 r \sin^2 (k_m \Delta x/2)
&lt;/math&gt;
Define the amplification factor
:&lt;math&gt;
  G \equiv \frac{\epsilon_j^{n+1}}{\epsilon_j^n}
&lt;/math&gt;
The necessary and sufficient condition for the error to remain bounded is that &lt;math&gt;\vert G \vert \leq 1.&lt;/math&gt; 
However,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \quad (8) \qquad G = \frac{e^{a(t+\Delta t)} e^{ik_m x}}{e^{at} e^{ik_m x}} = e^{a\Delta t}
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, from equations (7) and (8), the condition for stability is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \quad (9) \qquad \left\vert 1 - 4 r \sin^2 (k_m \Delta x/2) \right\vert \leq 1
&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the term &lt;math&gt;4 r \sin^2 (k_m \Delta x/2)&lt;/math&gt; is always positive.  Thus, to satisfy Equation (9):
:&lt;math&gt;
  \quad (10) \qquad  4 r \sin^2 (k_m \Delta x/2) \leq 2
&lt;/math&gt;
For the above condition to hold for all &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;  (and therefore all &lt;math&gt;\sin^2 (k_m \Delta x/2)&lt;/math&gt;), we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \quad (11) \qquad r=\frac{\alpha \Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \leq \frac{1}{2}  
&lt;/math&gt;
Equation (11) gives the stability requirement for the [[FTCS scheme]] as applied to one-dimensional heat equation. It says that for a given &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;, the allowed value of &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; must be small enough to satisfy equation (10).

'''William Thomas''' "'''Bill'''" '''Tutte''' &lt;small&gt;[[Order of Canada|OC]] [[Royal Society|FRS]] [[Royal Society of Canada|FRSC]]&lt;/small&gt; ({{IPAc-en|t|ʌ|t}}; 14 May 1917 – 2 May 2002) was a British [[cryptanalysis|codebreaker]] and mathematician. During the [[Second World War]], he made a brilliant and fundamental advance in [[cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher]], a major [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] cipher system which was used for top-secret communications within the [[Wehrmacht]] High Command. The high-level, strategic nature of the intelligence obtained from Tutte's crucial breakthrough, in the bulk decrypting of Lorenz-enciphered messages specifically, contributed greatly, and perhaps even decisively, to the defeat of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="Hinsley 1993 8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinsley|1993|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brzezinski 2005 18"&gt;{{harv|Brzezinski|2005|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a number of significant mathematical accomplishments, including foundation work in the fields of [[graph theory]] and [[matroid theory]].&lt;ref name="frs"&gt;{{Harvnb|Younger|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacTutorBiog"/&gt;

Tutte's research in the field of graph theory proved to be of remarkable importance. At a time when graph theory was still a primitive subject, Tutte commenced the study of [[matroid]]s and developed them into a theory by expanding from the work that [[Hassler Whitney]] had first developed around the mid 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Will|title=Matroids|url=http://www.math.washington.edu/~morrow/336_09/papers/Will.pdf|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Tutte's contributions to graph theory have been influential to modern graph theory and many of his theorems have been used to keep making advances in the field, most of his terminology was not in agreement with their conventional usage and thus his terminology is not used by graph theorists today.&lt;ref name="Hobbs 2004 322"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hobbs | first = Arthur M. |authorlink=Arthur Hobbs (mathematician)|author2=James G.

==Early life and education==
Tutte was born in [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] in Suffolk. He was the younger son of William John Tutte (1873–1944), an estate gardener, and Annie (''née'' Newell; 1881–1956), a housekeeper. Both parents worked at Fitzroy House stables where Tutte was born.&lt;ref name="MacTutorBiog"/&gt; The family spent some time in Buckinghamshire, County Durham and Yorkshire before returning to Newmarket, where Tutte attended [[Cheveley]] Church of England primary school.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; In 1927, when he was ten, Tutte won a scholarship to the [[Cambridgeshire High School for Boys|Cambridge and County High School for Boys]]. He took up his place there in 1928. In 1935 he won a scholarship to study natural sciences at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he specialized in chemistry and graduated with first class honours in 1938.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; He continued with [[physical chemistry]] as a graduate student, but transferred to mathematics at the end of 1940.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; As a student, he (along with three of his friends) became one of the first to solve the problem of [[squaring the square]], and the first to solve the problem without a squared subrectangle. Together the four created the pseudonym [[Blanche Descartes]], under which Tutte published occasionally for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Smith | first1 = Cedric A.

Soon after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Tutte's tutor, Patrick Duff, suggested him for war work at the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] at [[Bletchley Park]] (BP). He was interviewed and sent on a training course in London before going to Bletchley Park, where he joined the Research Section. At first, he worked on the [[Boris Hagelin|Hagelin]] cipher that was being used by the Italian Navy. This was a [[Rotor machine|rotor cipher]] machine that was available commercially, so the mechanics of enciphering was known, and decrypting messages only required working out how the machine was set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tutte|2006|pp=352–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1941, Tutte was transferred to work on a project called Fish. Intelligence information had revealed that the Germans called the wireless teleprinter transmission systems ''"Sägefisch"'' (sawfish). This led the British to use the code [[Fish (cryptography)|Fish]] for the German teleprinter cipher system.  The nickname Tunny (tunafish) was used for the first non-Morse link, and it was subsequently used for the Lorenz SZ machines and the traffic that they enciphered.&lt;ref&gt;Codebreakers : the inside story of Bletchley Park, F.H. Hinsley, Alan Stripp, 1994, https://books.google.com/books?id=j1MC2d2LPAcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Codebreakers+:+the+inside+story+of+Bletchley+Park,&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Introduction%20to%20fish&amp;f=false, An Introduction to Fish, Hinsley, pp. 141–148&lt;/ref&gt;

Telegraphy used the [[bit|5-bit]] [[ITA2|International Telegraphy Alphabet No. 2]] (ITA2). Nothing was known about the mechanism of enciphering other than that messages were preceded by a 12-letter [[Cryptanalysis#Indicator|indicator]], which implied a 12-wheel rotor cipher machine. The first step, therefore, had to be to diagnose the machine by establishing the logical structure and hence the functioning of the machine. Tutte played a pivotal role in achieving this, and it was not until shortly before the Allied victory in Europe in 1945, that Bletchley Park acquired a Tunny [[Lorenz cipher]] machine.&lt;ref name=Sale&gt;{{Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony | author-link = Anthony Sale | title = The Lorenz Cipher and how Bletchley Park broke it | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/lorenz/fish.htm | accessdate = 21 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tutte's breakthroughs led eventually to bulk decrypting of Tunny-enciphered messages between the German High Command [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|(OKW)]] in Berlin and their army commands throughout occupied Europe and contributed—perhaps decisively—to the defeat of Germany.&lt;ref name="Hinsley 1993 8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brzezinski 2005 18"/&gt;

===Diagnosing the cipher machine===
On 31 August 1941, two versions of the same message were sent using identical keys, which constituted a "[[Cryptanalysis#Depth|depth]]". This allowed [[John Tiltman]], Bletchley Park's veteran and remarkably gifted cryptanalyst, to deduce that it was a [[Gilbert Vernam|Vernam cipher]] which uses the [[Exclusive or|Exclusive Or (XOR)]] function (symbolised by "⊕"), and to extract the two messages and hence obtain the obscuring key. After a fruitless period during which Research Section cryptanalysts tried to work out how the Tunny machine worked, this and some other keys were handed to Tutte, who was asked to "see what you can make of these".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tutte|2006|p=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lorenz-SZ42-2.jpg|right|280px|thumbnail|The Lorenz SZ42 machine with its covers removed. [[Bletchley Park]] museum]]
At his training course, Tutte had been taught the [[Kasiski examination]] technique of writing out a key on squared paper, starting a new row after a defined number of characters that was suspected of being the frequency of repetition of the key.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bauer|2006|p=375}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this number was correct, the columns of the matrix would show more repetitions of sequences of characters than chance alone. Tutte knew that the Tunny indicators used 25 letters (excluding J) for 11 of the positions, but only 23 letters for the other. He therefore tried Kasiski's technique on the first impulse of the key characters, using a repetition of 25 × 23 = 575. He did not observe a large number of column repetitions with this period, but he did observe the phenomenon on a diagonal. He therefore tried again with 574, which showed up repeats in the columns. Recognising that the [[prime factor]]s of this number are 2, 7 and 41, he tried again with a period of 41 and "got a rectangle of dots and crosses that was replete with repetitions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tutte|2006|pp=356–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was clear, however, that the first impulse of the key was more complicated than that produced by a single wheel of 41 key impulses. Tutte called this component of the key &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (''chi''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). He figured that there was another component, which was XOR-ed with this, that did not always change with each new character, and that this was the product of a wheel that he called &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (''psi''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). The same applied for each of the five impulses (&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;). So for a single character, the whole key '''K''' consisted of two components:
:::: &lt;big&gt;K&lt;/big&gt; = &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;  ⊕  &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/big&gt;

At Bletchley Park, mark impulses were signified by '''x''' and space impulses by '''•'''.{{refn|group=nb|In more recent terminology, each impulse would be termed a "[[bit]]" with a mark being binary 1 and a space being binary 0. Punched paper tape had a hole for a mark and no hole for a space.}} For example, the letter "H" would be coded as '''••x•x'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|pp=348, 349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tutte's derivation of the ''chi'' and ''psi'' components was made possible by the fact that dots were more likely than not to be followed by dots, and crosses more likely than not to be followed by crosses. This was a product of a weakness in the German key setting, which they later eliminated. Once Tutte had made this breakthrough, the rest of the Research Section joined in to study the other impulses, and it was established that the five ''chi'' wheels all advanced with each new character and that the five ''psi'' wheels all moved together under the control of two ''mu'' or "motor" wheels. Over the following two months, Tutte and other members of the Research Section worked out the complete logical structure of the machine, with its set of wheels bearing cams that could either be in a position (raised) that added '''x''' to the stream of key characters, or in the alternative position that added in '''•'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tutte|2006|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosing the functioning of the Tunny machine in this way was a truly remarkable cryptanalytical achievement which, in the citation for Tutte's induction as an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]], was described as "one of the greatest intellectual feats of World War II".&lt;ref name="MacTutorBiog"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Connor|Robertson|2003}} &lt;!-- {{cite web | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/lorenz/fish.htm | title = The Lorenz Cipher and how Bletchley Park broke it | publisher = Codesandciphers.org.uk | date=30 August 1941 | accessdate=26 October 2011 }}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tutte's statistical method===
{{See also|Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher#The "1+2 break in"|label 1=Tutte's "1+2 break in"}}
To decrypt a Tunny message required knowledge not only of the logical functioning of the machine, but also the start positions of each rotor for the particular message. The search was on for a process that would manipulate the ciphertext or key to produce a frequency distribution of characters that departed from the uniformity that the enciphering process aimed to achieve. While on secondment to the Research Section in July 1942, [[Alan Turing]] worked out that the XOR combination of the values of successive characters in a stream of ciphertext and key emphasised any departures from a uniform distribution. The resultant stream (symbolised by the Greek letter "delta" '''Δ''') was called the [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher#Differencing|difference]] because XOR is the same as modulo 2 subtraction.

The reason that this provided a way into Tunny was that although the frequency distribution of characters in the ciphertext could not be distinguished from a random stream, the same was not true for a version of the ciphertext from which the ''chi'' element of the key had been removed. This was the case because where the plaintext contained a repeated character and the ''psi'' wheels did not move on, the differenced ''psi'' character ('''Δ'''&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;) would be the null character ('&lt;span style="font-size:140%;"&gt;'''/'''&lt;/span&gt; ' at Bletchley Park).  When XOR-ed with any character, this character has no effect. Repeated characters in the plaintext were more frequent both because of the characteristics of German (EE, TT, LL and SS are relatively common),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Singh | first = Simon | author-link = Simon Singh | title = The Black Chamber | url = http://www.simonsingh.net/The_Black_Chamber/hintsandtips.html | accessdate = 28 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and because telegraphists frequently repeated the figures-shift and letters-shift characters&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Newman|Newman]] c. 1944 p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; as their loss in an ordinary telegraph message could lead to gibberish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|2004|p = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To quote the General Report on Tunny:&lt;blockquote&gt;Turingery introduced the principle that the key differenced at one, now called '''ΔΚ''', could yield information unobtainable from ordinary key. This '''Δ''' principle was to be the fundamental basis of nearly all statistical methods of wheel-breaking and setting.&lt;ref name="GRoT11B6"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tutte exploited this amplification of non-uniformity in the differenced values {{refn|group=nb|For this reason Tutte's 1 + 2 method is sometimes called the "double delta" method.}} and by November 1942 had produced a way of discovering wheel starting points of the Tunny machine which became known as the "Statistical Method".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tutte|1998|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of this method was to find the initial settings of the ''chi'' component of the key by exhaustively trying all positions of its combination with the ciphertext, and looking for evidence of the non-uniformity that reflected the characteristics of the original plaintext.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|pp=321–322}} in ''44. Hand Statistical Methods: Setting – Statistical Methods''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2006|pp=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because any repeated characters in the plaintext would always generate '''•''', and similarly ∆&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊕ ∆&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; would generate '''•''' whenever the ''psi'' wheels did not move on, and about half of the time when they did – some 70% overall.

As well as applying differencing to the full 5-bit characters of the ITA2 code, Tutte applied it to the individual impulses (bits).{{refn|group=nb|The five impulses or bits of the coded characters are sometimes referred to as five levels.}} The current ''chi'' wheel cam settings needed to have been established to allow the relevant sequence of characters of the ''chi'' wheels to be generated. It was totally impracticable to generate the 22 million characters from all five of the ''chi'' wheels, so it was initially limited to 41 × 31 = 1271 from the first two. After explaining his findings to [[Max Newman]], Newman was given the job of developing an automated approach to comparing ciphertext and key to look for departures from randomness. The first machine was dubbed [[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)|Heath Robinson]], but the much faster [[Colossus computer]], developed by [[Tommy Flowers]] and using algorithms written by Tutte and his colleagues, soon took over for breaking codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/about/professor-william-t-tutte/biography-professor-tutte#bletchley | title=Biography of Professor Tutte | date=August 2002 | first=Dan | last=Younger | work=CMS Notes | via=University of Waterloo | accessdate=24 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Roberts | first = Jerry | author-link = Jerry Roberts | title = Lorenz: Breaking Hitler's top secret code at Bletchley Park | place = Stroud, Gloucestershire | publisher = The History Press | year = 2017 | isbn = 978 0 7509 7885 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctorate and career==
Tutte completed a doctorate in mathematics from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in 1948 under the supervision of [[Shaun Wylie]], who had also worked at Bletchley Park on Tunny. In late 1945, Tutte resumed his studies at Cambridge, now as a graduate student in mathematics. He published some work begun earlier, one a now famous paper that characterises which graphs have a perfect matching, and another that constructs a non-Hamiltonian graph. He went on to create a ground-breaking PhD thesis, ''An algebraic theory of graphs'', about the subject later known as matroid theory.&lt;ref name="uwaterloo.ca"&gt;https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/about/professor-william-t-tutte/biography-professor-tutte&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, invited by [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter]], he accepted a position at the [[University of Toronto]]. In 1962, he moved to the [[University of Waterloo]] in [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], Ontario, where he stayed for the rest of his academic career. He officially retired in 1985, but remained active as an emeritus professor. Tutte was instrumental in helping to found the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo.

His mathematical career concentrated on [[combinatorics]], especially [[graph theory]], which he is credited as having helped create in its modern form, and [[matroid theory]], to which he made profound contributions; one colleague &lt;!-- Dr. Younger --&gt; described him as "the leading mathematician in combinatorics for three decades". He was editor in chief of the ''[[Journal of Combinatorial Theory]]'' until retiring from Waterloo in 1985.&lt;ref name="uwaterloo.ca"/&gt; He also served on the editorial boards of several other mathematical research journals.

==Research contributions==
Tutte's work in [[graph theory]] includes the structure of [[cycle space]]s and [[cut space]]s, the size of [[maximum matching]]s and existence of [[k-factor (graph theory)|''k''-factor]]s in graphs, and [[Hamiltonian path|Hamiltonian]] and non-Hamiltonian graphs.&lt;ref name="uwaterloo.ca"/&gt; He disproved [[Tait's conjecture]], on the Hamiltonicity of [[polyhedral graph]]s, by using the construction known as [[Tutte's fragment]]. The eventual proof of the [[four colour theorem]] made use of his earlier work. The graph polynomial he called the "dichromate" has become famous and influential under the name of the [[Tutte polynomial]] and serves as the prototype of combinatorial invariants that are universal for all invariants that satisfy a specified reduction law.

The first major advances in [[matroid theory]] were made by Tutte in his 1948 Cambridge PhD thesis which formed the basis of an important sequence of papers published over the next two decades. Tutte's work in graph theory and matroid theory has been profoundly influential on the development of both the content and direction of these two fields.&lt;ref name="Hobbs 2004 322"/&gt; In matroid theory, he discovered the highly sophisticated [[Tutte homotopy theorem|homotopy theorem]] and founded the studies of [[matroid|chain group]]s and [[regular matroid]]s, about which he proved deep results.

In addition, Tutte developed an algorithm for determining whether a given [[binary matroid]] is a [[graphic matroid]]. The algorithm makes use of the fact that a planar graph is simply a graph whose circuit-matroid, the dual of its [[Dual matroid|bond-matroid]], is graphic.&lt;ref&gt;W.T Tutte. An algorithm for determining whether a given binary matroid is graphic, ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society'', '''11'''(1960)905–917&lt;/ref&gt;

Tutte wrote a paper entitled ''How to Draw a Graph'' in which he proved that any face in a 3-connected graph is enclosed by a [[peripheral cycle]]. Using this fact, Tutte developed an alternative proof to show that every Kuratowski graph is non-planar by showing that ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; each have three distinct peripheral cycles with a common edge. In addition to using peripheral cycles to prove that the Kuratowski graphs are non-planar, Tutte proved that every simple 3-connected graph can be drawn with all its faces convex, and devised an algorithm which constructs the plane drawing by solving a linear system. The resulting drawing is known as the [[Tutte embedding]].
Tutte's algorithm makes use of the [[barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric]] mappings of the peripheral circuits of a simple 3-connected graph.&lt;ref&gt;W.T. Tutte. How to draw a graph. Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, 13(3):743–768, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

The findings published in this paper have proved to be of much significance because the algorithms that Tutte developed have become popular planar graph drawing methods.
One of the reasons for which Tutte's embedding is popular is that the necessary computations that are carried out by his algorithms are simple and guarantee a one-to-one correspondence of a graph and its embedding onto the [[Euclidean plane]], which is of importance when parameterising a three-dimensional mesh to the plane in geometric modelling. "Tutte's theorem is the basis for solutions to other computer graphics problems, such as [[Morphing#Present use of morphing|morphing]]."&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Gortle; Craig Gotsman; Dylan Thurston. "Discrete One-Forms on Meshes and Applications to 3D Mesh Parameterization", ''Computer Aided Geometric Design'', 23(2006)83–112&lt;/ref&gt;

Tutte was mainly responsible for developing the theory of [[graph enumeration|enumeration]] of planar graphs, which has close links with chromatic and dichromatic polynomials. This work involved some highly innovative techniques of his own invention, requiring considerable manipulative dexterity in handling power series (whose coefficients count appropriate kinds of graphs) and the functions arising as their sums, as well as geometrical dexterity in extracting these power series from the graph-theoretic situation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Crispin Nash-Williams|C. St. J. A. Nash-Williams]], A Note on Some of Professor Tutte's Mathematical Work, Graph Theory and Related Topics (eds. J.A Bondy and U. S. R Murty), Academic Press, New York, 1979, p. xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tutte summarised his work in the ''Selected Papers of W.T. Tutte'', 1979, and in ''Graph Theory as I have known it'', 1998.&lt;ref name="uwaterloo.ca"/&gt;

==Personal life and death==
In addition to the career benefits of working at the new [[University of Waterloo]], the more rural setting of [[Waterloo County]] appealed to Bill and his wife Dorothea.  They bought a house in the nearby village of [[West Montrose, Ontario]] where they enjoyed hiking, spending time in their garden on the Grand River and allowing others to enjoy the beautiful scenery of their property.

They also had an extensive knowledge of all the birds in their garden. Dorothea, an avid potter, was also a keen hiker and Bill organised hiking trips. Even near the end of his life Bill still was an avid walker.&lt;ref name="Hobbs 2004 322"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bill Tutte | url=http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Obits2/Tutte_Telegraph.html | publisher=Telegraph Group Limited | access-date=21 May 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927151741/http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Obits2/Tutte_Telegraph.html | archive-date=27 September 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his wife died in 1994, he moved back to Newmarket (Suffolk), but then returned to Waterloo in 2000, where he died two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = van der Vat | first = Dan | author-link = Dan van der Vat | title = Obituary: William Tutte | place =London | work = The Guardian | date = 10 May 2002 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/may/10/guardianobituaries.obituaries | accessdate = 28 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in West Montrose United Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;http://geneofun.on.ca/names/photo/858001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uwaterloo.ca"/&gt;
