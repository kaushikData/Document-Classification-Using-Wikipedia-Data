      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3715">The '''''tapping protocol''''' is an initiative developed by the City of New York to provide members of the deaf and hard of hearing community, as well as others who are unable to voice, with a means of directly reporting emergencies to [[9-1-1]] from the streets of [[New York City]].

The tapping protocol can be employed when calling 9-1-1 from a [[pay phone]] or when using one of New York City’s emergency call boxes to summon help. In both cases, the person reporting the emergency communicates with the 9-1-1 call-taker by tapping in a specific pattern with a finger, pen, key, etc., on the mouthpiece of the phone or the speaker section of the call box.

Two tapping patterns are used in order to distinguish the type of assistance requested: a steady tapping pattern indicates a request for Police assistance, while a repeated two-tap pattern indicates a request for [[Fire department|Fire]] and [[Emergency medical services|Emergency Medical Service]] (“EMS”) response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Del Signore|first1=John|title=Do YOU Know The "911 Tapping Protocol"?|url=http://gothamist.com/2014/01/15/911_tapping_protocol.php|website=Gothamist|accessdate=17 March 2018|date=Jan 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225073442/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/15/911_tapping_protocol.php|archive-date=2018-02-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Call for Help in an Emergency for the Deaf &amp; Hard of Hearing, Tapping protocol (CC)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQD0uDz5gVM|publisher=New York City Fire Department (FDNY)|accessdate=17 March 2018|format=video|date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person reporting the emergency should employ the appropriate tapping method for at least 90 seconds, and ideally until the requested emergency services arrive. If possible, the person should remain at the pay phone or call box location to direct arriving Police, Fire, or EMS personnel to the emergency.

== History  {{anchor|Subdivisions}} ==
The tapping protocol was introduced in 1996&lt;ref&gt;''Civic Association of the Deaf v. Giuliani'', 970 F. Supp. 352, 357 (S.D.N.Y. 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; in order to meet a federal court's requirement that New York offer a 9-1-1 notification alternative that would "provide the hearing-impaired with a means of identifying not only their location, but also the type of emergency being reported."&lt;ref&gt;''Civic Association of the Deaf v. Giuliani'', 915 F. Supp. 622, 638 (S.D.N.Y. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Under New York City’s [[Enhanced 9-1-1]] ("E-911") system, every telephone and emergency call box automatically transmits its location to 911 operators, so that an operator receiving a tapping call will have the caller's location on-screen and will be able to distinguish, by the tapping pattern, which emergency services are being requested.

The tapping protocol and E-911 system have been in place in New York City since then.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7913">'''Aliteracy''' (sometimes spelled alliteracy) is the state of being able to read but being uninterested in doing so. This phenomenon has been reported on as a problem occurring separately from [[illiteracy]], which is more common in the developing world, while aliteracy is primarily a problem in the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/06/education/the-lost-book-generation.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Roger | last=Cohen | title=The Lost Book Generation | date=January 6, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, John Ramsey defined aliteracy as a loss of a reading habit usually since reading is slow and frustrating for the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramsey|first=John|title=Hell's Bibliophiles: The fifth way of looking at an aliterate|journal=Change|year=2002|volume=34|issue=1|pages=50–56|doi=10.1080/00091380209601835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unesco International Book Year report==
In a publication analyzing the 1972 [[International Book Year]], an estimate was given that as many as 57% of the citizens of an unnamed European nation known for their production of important books did not read books, or that 43% were book readers. Estimates for other industrialized nations' active readers ranged from 33 to 55%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0001/000122/012250eo.pdf Anatomy of an International Year]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary from authors, businesses and educators==
[[Jim Trelease]], author of ''The Read-Aloud Handbook'', has stated that this trend away from the written word is more than worrisome, and that it's tearing apart culture. People who have stopped reading, he says, "base their future decisions on what they used to know...If you don't read much, you really don't know much...you're dangerous."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=The No-Book Report: Skim It and Weep|date=May 14, 2001|first=Linton|last=Weeks| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A23370-2001May13 | work=[[The Washington Post]]}}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American historian [[Daniel Boorstin]], in 1984, while serving as [[librarian of Congress]], issued a landmark report: "Books in Our Future". Citing recent statistics that only about half of all Americans read regularly every year, he referred to the "twin menaces" of illiteracy and aliteracy. "In the United States today," Boorstin wrote, "aliteracy is widespread."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; In the United States, a 2008 study reported that 46.7% of adult Americans did not read a book not required for work or school during 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Endowment for the Arts|title=Reading on the Rise|url=http://www.nea.gov/research/readingonrise.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320151903/http://www.nea.gov/research/readingonrise.pdf|archivedate=March 20, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another alert to this phenomenon was a 1991 editorial in [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] by Stratford P. Sherman (with Laurie Kretchmar). It refers to a study by John P. Robinson, a sociology professor at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], showing that the average American at that time spent only 24 minutes per day in reading. [[Samuel Robert Lichter]], director of the [[Center for Media and Public Affairs]], is quoted on his preference for the ease of turning on the TV instead of reading a book.

Kylene Beers' 1996 study connected aliteracy with reading motivation in teens. She noted unmotivated readers complained about not connecting with the text and could not "see" or visualize what was happening in the book. The inability to relate to the characters reduced the desire to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beers|first=Kylene|title=No time, no interest, no way! The 3 voices of aliteracy|journal=[[School Library Journal]]|year=1996|volume=42|issue=2|pages=30–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Putnam]], in his book ''Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community'' argues that [[television]] has fragmented our society.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

==Ways to create readers==
[[File:Reading time in Laos - Big Brother Mouse book corner.jpg|thumb|A boy in Laos selects a book to read for his school's new Sustained Silent Reading program.]][[Motorola]] is mentioned as making preparations to pay $5,000,000 to teach their workers reading skills, and [[Ford Motor Company]] is described as, since 1982, having already sent 32,000 workers to a similar program. Publisher [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] was quoted as predicting a market of $500,000,000 per year in the sales of remedial programs to corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1991/11/18/75745/index.htm | work=CNN | first=Stratford P. | last=Sherman | title=America won't win till it reads more and instead it's reading less. Yet reading is strongly connected to communicating, thinking, imagining -- the skills any country will need to compete globally | date=November 18, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Layne's book, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20120405012205/http://www.stenhouse.com/shop/pc/viewprd.asp?idProduct=9302 Igniting a Passion for Reading]" discusses several proven methods that readers can do to increase the desire to read in others.

One method is to read aloud, both to children and adults. Reading aloud allows the listener to hear the story without struggling through decoding the words and possible frustration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Steven L.|title=Igniting a Passion for Reading: Successful Strategies for Building Lifetime Readers |year=2009|publisher=Stenhouse Publishers|location=Portland, ME|isbn=978-1-57110-385-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method, used in schools, is to encourage students to read every day, choosing for themselves what to read, and reading simply for enjoyment. This is often referred to as [[Sustained Silent Reading]] (SSR). Dr. Stephen Krashen, a leading proponent of SSR, looked at 54 studies of such programs and found that in general they were successful at improving reading skills and building a reading habit.&lt;ref&gt;Krashen, Stephen D., 2011. ''Free Voluntary Reading.'' Santa Barbara: Libraries Unlimited, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Mathematics Competitions (AMC)''' are the first of a series of competitions in secondary school [[mathematics]] that determine the United States team for the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] (IMO). The selection process takes place over the course of roughly four stages. At the last stage, the [[Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program]] (MOP), the United States coaches select six members to form the IMO team. The United States Math Team of 1994 is the only team ever to achieve a perfect score (all six members earned perfect marks), and is colloquially known as the "dream team".

There are three levels:
* the AMC 8 is for students in grades 8 and below
* the AMC 10 is for students in grades 10 and below
* the AMC 12 is for students in grades 12 and below

Students who perform well on the AMC 10 or AMC 12 exams are invited to participate in the [[American Invitational Mathematics Examination]] (AIME). Students who perform well on the AIME are then invited to the [[United States of America Mathematical Olympiad]] (USAMO) or United States of America Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAJMO). Students who do exceptionally well on the USAMO (typically around 30 students) are invited to go to the [[Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program]] (MOSP or more commonly, MOP), and six students are selected from the top twelve scorers on the USAMO (through yet another exam, the Team Selection Test (TST)) to form the United States International Math Olympiad Team.

'''American Mathematics Competitions''' is also the name of the organization, based in Washington, DC, responsible for creating, distributing and coordinating the American Mathematics Competitions contests, which include the American Mathematics Contest, AIME, and USAMO.

==History==

The "members of the Committee on the American Mathematics Competitions (CAMC) are dedicated to the goal of strengthening the mathematical capabilities of our nation's youth. The CAMC believes that one way to meet this goal is to identify, recognize and reward excellence in mathematics through a series of national contests called the American Mathematics Competitions". The AMC include: the American Mathematics Contest 8 (AMC 8) (formerly the American Junior High School Mathematics Examination) for students in grades 8 and below, begun in 1985; the American Mathematics Contest 10 (AMC 10), for students in grades 9 and 10, begun in 2000; the American Mathematics Contest 12 (AMC 12) (formerly the American High School Mathematics Examination) for students in grades 11 and 12, begun in 1950; the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME), begun in 1983; and the USA Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO), begun in 1972.&lt;ref name="AMC"&gt;[http://www.maa.org/math-competitions/amc-contests American Mathematics Competitions | Mathematical Association of America].

==Benefits of participating==

There are certain rewards for doing well on the AMC tests.  For the AMC 8, a perfect score may earn a book prize or a plaque (as it did for the students who achieved perfect scores in 2002); a list of high scoring students is also available to colleges, institutions, and programs who want to attract students strong in mathematics.  This may earn a high scorer an invitation to places like [[MathPath]], a summer program for middle schoolers.  The top-scoring student in each school is also awarded a special pin.

For the AMC 10 and AMC 12, a high score earns recognition (in particular, perfect scorers' names and pictures are published in a special awards book); as with the AMC 8, a list of high-scoring students is also available to colleges, institutions, etc.  The top-scoring student in each school is awarded a special pin, or a bronze, silver, or gold medal, depending on how many times he or she was the top scorer.

In addition, high scorers on the AMC 10 and AMC 12 qualify to take the next round of competitions, the 3-hour long American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME), typically held in March or April. Any student who scores in the top 1% on the AMC 10 (or 2.5% as of 2011), scores in the top 5% on the AMC 12,  scores at least 100 points on the AMC 12, or scores at least 120 on the AMC 10 is invited to take the AIME.* The answer to each of the 15 questions on the AIME is an [[integer]] between 0 and 999 [[interval (mathematics)|inclusive]], so while it is technically a multiple-choice test, it is not one in practice.

The combined scores of the AMC 12 and the AIME are used to determine approximately 270 individuals that will be invited back to take a 9-hour, 2-day, 6-problem session of proofs known as the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO), while the combined scores of the AMC 10 and the AIME are used to determine approximately 230 individuals that will be invited to take the United States of America Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAJMO), which follows the same format. Approximately thirty students are selected based on their USAMO performance to be trained at the [[Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program]], or MOSP (better known as MOP to its participants). Approximately 12 of the top USAJMO scorers are invited as well. Unless qualifying for a particularly high level, all students must be in 9th grade or higher to be admitted into MOSP, and high school seniors are admitted only if they are members of that year's IMO team.

During this summer camp, a 3-day exam (the TSTST) is given to determine the approximately 18 individuals who will form the TSTST group. These individuals take a series of contests throughout the year, such as the [[Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad]], to finally pick the 6 member US Mathematics Team that will represent the US at the [[International Math Olympiad]].  The current head coach of the US IMO team is Po-Shen Loh from [[Carnegie Mellon University]]

==Rules and scoring==
===AMC 8===

The AMC 8 is a 25 multiple-choice question, 40-minute test for middle schoolers designed to promote the development and enhancement of problem-solving skills.&lt;ref name="AMC"/&gt; No problems require the use of a calculator, and their use has been banned since 2008. Though the contest is typically held on a Thursday in November, in 2018 the AMC 8 will take place on Tuesday, November 13.

The AMC 8 is scored based on the number of questions answered correctly only.  There is no penalty for getting a question wrong, and each question has equal value.  Thus, a student who answers 23 questions correctly and 2 questions incorrectly receives a score of 23. This is not a standardized test; i.e. no school has to take it, but some schools choose to, mainly to encourage growth in mathematics among their students. Full scorers on the AMC 8 (25/25) get recognition and their picture on the AMCs website as a top scorer.

====Rankings and awards====

'''Ranking'''

Based on questions correct:
* Distinguished Honor Roll: Top 1% (has ranged from 20-25)
* Honor Roll: Top 5% (has ranged from 16-19) 

'''Awards'''
* A Certificate of Distinction is given to all students who receive a perfect score.
* An AMC 8 Winner Pin is given to the student(s) in each school with the highest score.
* The top three students for each school section will receive respectively a gold, silver, or bronze Certificate for Outstanding Achievement.
* An AMC 8 Honor Roll Certificate is given to all high scoring students.
* An AMC 8 Merit Certificate is given to high scoring students who are in 6th grade or below.

===AMC 10 and AMC 12===

The AMC 10 and AMC 12 are 25 question, 75-minute multiple choice examinations in secondary school mathematics containing problems which can be understood and solved with pre-calculus concepts.  From 1994-2007, calculators were allowed, but like the AMC 8, unneeded.&lt;ref name="AMC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AMC" /&gt;

Since the 2007-2008 school year, calculators have been disallowed on all of the selection tests for the International Math Olympiad Team (including AMC, AIME, USAMO, TST)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maa.org/math-competitions/about-amc/faq&lt;/ref&gt;

High scores on the AMC 10 or 12 can qualify the participant for the [[American Invitational Mathematics Examination]] (AIME).&lt;ref&gt;[http://amc.maa.org/e-exams/e7-aime/aime.shtml American Mathematics Competitions | Mathematical Association of America]. Amc.maa.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the AMC 10, the top 2.5 % make it; around 110 to 120 points. On the AMC 12, the top 5% make it; around 90 to 100 points.

Each exam is scored based on the number of questions answered correctly and the number of questions left blank.  A student receives 6 points for each question answered correctly, 1.5 points for each question left blank, and no points for incorrect answers.  Thus, a student who answers 18 correctly, leaves 5 blanks, and misses 2 gets 18×6 + 5×1.5 = 115.5 points.  The maximum possible score is 6×25 = 150 points; in 2006, the AMC 12 had a total of 17 perfect scores between its two administrations, while the AMC 10 had 89.

From 1974 until 1999, the exam had 30 questions and was 90 minutes long, scoring 5 points for correct answers. Originally during this time period, 1 point was awarded for leaving an answer blank, however, it was changed in the late 1980s to 2 points for omitted questions. When the exam was shortened as part of the 2000 rebranding, the value of a correct answer was increased to 6 points (keeping 150 as a perfect score). In 2001, the score of a blank was increased to 2.5 to penalize guessing. The 2007 exams were the first with only 1.5 points awarded for a blank, to discourage students from leaving a large number of questions blank in order to assure qualification for the AIME. For example, on the AMC 12, a student could advance with only 11 correct answers, presuming the remaining questions were left blank. Now, a student must answer at least 14 questions correctly to reach 100 points.

The exams somewhat overlap, with the medium-hard AMC 10 questions being the same as the medium-easy ones on the AMC 12. Since 2002, two administrations have been scheduled, so as to avoid conflicts with school breaks. Students are eligible to take an A exam and a B exam, and may even take the AMC 10-A and the AMC 12-B, though they may not take both the AMC 10 and AMC 12 from the same date. If a student takes both exams, they may use either score towards qualification to the AIME or USAMO.

==Biography==
Tanenbaum was born in [[New York City]] and grew up in suburban [[White Plains, New York]]. He is [[Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/khorostkov/khorostkov.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-07-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801033036/http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/khorostkov/khorostkov.html# |archive-date=2017-08-01 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandfather was born in [[Khorostkiv]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/home/faq.html |title=Andrew S.

===Books===
Tanenbaum is well recognized for his textbooks on computer science. They include:

His book, ''Operating Systems: Design and Implementation'' and [[MINIX]] were [[Linus Torvalds]]' inspiration for the [[Linux]] kernel. In his autobiography ''[[Just for Fun (book)|Just for Fun]]'', Torvalds describes it as "the book that launched me to new heights".

His books have been translated into many languages including Arabic, Basque, Bulgarian, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Macedonian, Mexican Spanish, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/home/faq.html# |title=Andrew S.

===Doctoral students===
Tanenbaum has had a number of [[Ph.D.]] students who themselves have gone on to become widely known computer science researchers.
These include:
* [[Henri Bal]], professor at the [[Vrije Universiteit]] in [[Amsterdam]]
* [[Frans Kaashoek]], professor at [[MIT]]
* Sape Mullender, researcher at [[Bell Labs]]
* Robbert van Renesse, professor at [[Cornell University]]
* Leendert van Doorn, distinguished engineer at the [[Microsoft]] Corporation
* [[Werner Vogels]], Chief Technology Officer at [[Amazon.com]]&lt;ref name="vogelsphd"/&gt;

===Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging===
In the early 1990s, the Dutch government began setting up a number of thematically oriented research schools that spanned multiple universities. These schools were intended to bring professors and Ph.D. students from different Dutch (and later, foreign) universities together to help them cooperate and enhance their research.

Tanenbaum was one of the cofounders and first Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging (ASCI). This school initially consisted of nearly 200 faculty members and Ph.D. students from the [[Vrije Universiteit]], [[University of Amsterdam]], [[Delft University of Technology]], and [[Leiden University]]. They were especially working on problems in advanced computer systems such as parallel computing and image analysis and processing.

Tanenbaum remained dean for 12 years, until 2005, when he was awarded an Academy Professorship by the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]], at which time he became a full-time research professor. ASCI has since grown to include researchers from nearly a dozen universities in The Netherlands, Belgium, and France. ASCI offers Ph.D. level courses, has an annual conference, and runs various workshops every year.

==Projects==

===Amsterdam Compiler Kit===
The [[Amsterdam Compiler Kit]] is a toolkit for producing portable compilers. It was started sometime before 1981 and Andrew Tanenbaum was the architect from the start until version 5.5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications/ Andrew S. Tanenbaum - Publications, Colloquia section]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509132250/http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/publications/ |date=May 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MINIX===
In 1987, Tanenbaum wrote a clone of [[UNIX]], called [[MINIX]] (MINi-unIX), for the [[IBM PC]]. It was targeted at students and others who wanted to learn how an operating system worked. Consequently, he wrote a book that listed the source code in an appendix and described it in detail in the text.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131429388 Amazon.com: Operating Systems Design and Implementation (3rd Edition) (Prentice Hall Software Series): Andrew S Tanenbaum, Albert S Woodhull: Books]&lt;/ref&gt; The source code itself was available on a set of floppy disks. Within three months, a [[Usenet]] newsgroup, comp.os.minix, had sprung up with over 40,000 subscribers discussing and improving the system. One of these subscribers was a Finnish student named [[Linus Torvalds]] who began adding new features to MINIX and tailoring it to his own needs. On October 5, 1991, Torvalds announced his own ([[POSIX]] like) kernel, called [[Linux]], which originally used the MINIX file system but is not based on MINIX code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/ Some notes on the "Who wrote Linux" Kerfuffle]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5sfayBi29?url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/ |date=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although MINIX and Linux have diverged, MINIX continues to be developed, now as a production system as well as an educational one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2006-04/openpdfs/herder.pdf# |title=USENIX April 06 |access-date=2007-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807222457/http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2006-04/openpdfs/herder.pdf# |archive-date=2007-08-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus is on building a highly modular, reliable, and secure operating system. The system is based on a [[microkernel]], with only 5000 lines of code running in kernel mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.few.vu.nl/~ast/# |title=Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Professor at the Vrije Universiteit |access-date=2009-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111055829/http://www.few.vu.nl/~ast/# |archive-date=2010-01-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the operating system runs as a number of independent processes in user mode, including processes for the file system, process manager, and each device driver. The system continuously monitors each of these processes, and when a failure is detected is often capable of automatically replacing the failed process without a reboot, without disturbing running programs, and without the user even noticing. [[MINIX 3]], as the current version is called, is available under the [[BSD license]] for free.

===Research projects===
Tanenbaum has also been involved in numerous other research projects in the areas of operating systems, distributed systems, and ubiquitous computing, often as supervisor of Ph.D. students or a [[postdoctoral researcher]]. These projects include:

===Electoral-vote.com===
In 2004, Tanenbaum created [[Electoral-vote.com]], a web site analyzing [[opinion polls]] for the [[2004 U.S. Presidential Election]], using them to project the outcome in the [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]]. He stated that he created the site as an American who "knows first hand what the world thinks of America and it is not a pretty picture at the moment. I want people to think of America as the land of freedom and democracy, not the land of arrogance and blind revenge. I want to be proud of America again."&lt;ref name="EVFAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoral-vote.com/info/votemaster-faq.html |title=The Votemaster FAQ |accessdate=2017-02-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041102014915/http://www.electoral-vote.com/info/votemaster-faq.html |archivedate=November 2, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site provided a color-coded map, updated each day with projections for each state's electoral votes. Through most of the campaign period Tanenbaum kept his identity secret, referring to himself as "the Votemaster" and acknowledging only that he personally preferred [[John Kerry]]. Mentioning that he supported the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]], he revealed his identity on November 1, 2004, the day before the election, and also stating his reasons and qualifications for running the website.&lt;ref name="EVFAQ" /&gt;

Through the site he also covered the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], correctly predicting the winner of all 33 Senate races that year.

For the [[United States elections, 2008|2008 elections]], he got every state right except for Indiana, which he said McCain would win by 2% (Obama won by 1%) and Missouri, which he said was too close to call (McCain won by 0.1%). He correctly predicted all the winners in the Senate except for Minnesota, where he predicted a 1% win by [[Norm Coleman]] over [[Al Franken]]. After 7 months of legal battling and recounts, Franken won by 312 votes (0.01%).

In 2010, he correctly projected 35 out of 37 Senate races in the Midterm elections on the website. The exceptions were [[Colorado]] and [[Nevada]].

Paris, 1875]]

'''''Ballet Master''''' (also ''Balletmaster'', ''Ballet Mistress'' [increasingly archaic English language use], ''Premier Maître de ballet'' or ''Premier Maître de ballet en Chef'') is the term used for an employee of a [[ballet company]] who is responsible for the level of competence of the dancers in their company. In modern times, ballet masters are generally charged with teaching the daily company ballet class and rehearsing the [[dancers]] for both new and established [[ballets]] in the company's repertoire. The artistic director of a ballet company, whether a male or female, may also be called its ballet master.  Historic use of [[gender marking in job titles]] in ballet (and live theatre) is being supplanted by [[gender-neutral language]] job titles regardless of an employee's gender (e.g. ''Ballet Master'' in lieu of ''Ballet Mistress'', ''Wig Master'' as an alternative to ''Wig Mistress''). 

==History of the position==
Especially during the early centuries of ballet troupes and ballet companies from the 18th century until the early 20th century, the position of ''First'' Ballet master, referred to traditionally as the ''Premier Maître de ballet en Chef'' or more simply as the ''Maître de ballet'', was the undisputed head of the company who acted as chief choreographer and ''[[Artistic Director]]''. His duties included creating ballets, dances in operas, commissioning music, and presiding over the teaching of the dancers and style desired. It was this head ballet master who had the responsibility of the artistic directorship of a particular group of dancers or of a theatre.

After the early 20th century, primarily after the disbandment of the original [[Ballets Russes]], the title has been used more to describe the master teachers/assistant directors of a ballet company, (previously known as ''Second'' Ballet master), with the head of a company being referred to as the ''Artistic Director''.

'''Barring out''' is the former custom in [[England|English]] schools of barring a [[schoolmaster]] from the premises.

A typical example of this practice was at the school in [[Bromfield, Cumbria]],&lt;ref&gt;Cumbria contains what used to be [[Cumberland]] County&lt;/ref&gt; where it was the custom "for the scholars, at Fasting's Even (the beginning of [[Lent]]) to depose and exclude the master from the school for three days."&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, William. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E3xbAAAAQAAJ The history of the county of Cumberland]. London, 1794. This must be the reference 1911 Britannica is referring to, but a Google search doesn't turn up the quote.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the school doors were barricaded and the boys armed with mock weapons. If the master's attempts to re-enter were successful, extra tasks were inflicted as a penalty, and willingly performed by the boys. On the third day terms of capitulation, usually in [[Latin]] verse, were signed, and these always conceded the immediate right to indulge in [[English public school football games|football]] and a [[cockfight]]. The custom was long retained at [[Eton College]] and figures in many school stories, including the story "The Barring Out: or Party Spirit" in ''[[The Parent's Assistant]]''
by [[Maria Edgeworth]] (1796), and the 1948 [[Billy Bunter]] story "Barring Out".[http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/r/frank-richards/billy-bunters-barring-out.htm])

More serious incidents of barring out reportedly took place at [[The Royal School, Armagh]], and [[Belfast Royal Academy]] in [[Northern Ireland]]; and at the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh]].

Dr. [[Samuel Johnson]] reports a story that [[Joseph Addison]], when a schoolboy, was the ringleader of a barring out at his school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcivilisation.com/smartboard/shop/johnsons/lives/addsn.htm Samuel Johnson, "Life of Addison", in Lives of the Poets]&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom extended to some early American Colonial schools, such as [[College of William &amp; Mary|William and Mary College]] in [[Virginia]], where students barred out [[James Blair (Virginia)|Dr. James Blair]] and shot at him with pistols when he attempted to enter.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Nissenbaum, The Battle for Christmas (Vintage, 1997), 113. {{ISBN|0-679-74038-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=Jan 1908|title=A Barring Out at William and Mary College|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|publisher=Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture|volume=16|issue=3|pages=180–199|jstor=1915609}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to 
[[David Hackett Fischer]], the custom became common in the southern highlands and the Ohio and Mississippi valleys, though occasionally taking place elsewhere in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;David Hackett Fischer, ''[[Albion's Seed]]'', (Oxford University Press, 1989), 725.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barring out continued in [[Falstone]], a village in Northumberland, until 1940 when the headmaster William Moody, who was unaware of the custom, demanded entrance to his school and the students eventually relented and let him enter.

'''Christoph Ananda Probst''' (born 6 November 1919, [[Murnau am Staffelsee]]&amp;nbsp;– 22 February 1943, [[Munich]]) was a German student of [[medicine]] and member of the [[White Rose]] (''Weiße Rose'') [[Widerstand|resistance]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{NDB|20|733|734|Probst, Christoph Ananda|Michael Probst|11917958X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==White Rose==
''[[White Rose]]'' was the name of a resistance group in Munich in the time of the [[Third Reich]]. The group, founded in June 1942, consisted of students from the Ludwig-Maximilians-[[University of Munich]] who distributed leaflets against the Nazis' war policy. Christoph Probst belonged, along with the [[Geschwister Scholl|Scholl siblings]], [[Willi Graf]] and [[Alexander Schmorell]] to the tightest circle, into which university professor [[Kurt Huber]] also came.

The members of White Rose put together, printed and distributed, at the risk of their lives, six leaflets in all. On 18 February 1943, the Scholls were distributing the sixth leaflet at the university when they were discovered by a custodian, who delivered them to the [[Gestapo]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmied, Jakub. Gestapo Interrogation Transcripts: Willi Graf, Alexander Schmorell, Hans Scholl, and Sophie Scholl. ZC13267, Volumes 1 – 16. Schmaus. 18 February 1943. E-Document.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February 1943, Christoph Probst and the Scholls were tried and sentenced together at the ''[[Volksgerichtshof]]'' by judge [[Roland Freisler]], who was known for often determining sentences even before the trial, and all three were sentenced to death by [[guillotine]]. Their sentences were carried out on the very same day at [[Stadelheim Prison]] in Munich.&lt;ref name=bpb/&gt;

Their grave may be found in the [[graveyard]] bordering the execution place, "Am Perlacher Forst".

==Background==
His father, Hermann Probst, was a private scholar and [[Sanskrit]] researcher, fostered contacts with [[artist]]s who were deemed by the Nazis to be "decadent". After his first marriage with Karin Katharina Kleeblatt, Christoph's mother, broke up in 1919, he married Elise Jaffée, who was [[Jew]]ish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpg.schulen.org/Probst/PDF/Christoph%20Probst.pdf |title=Christoph Probst |accessdate=2010-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129112107/http://cpg.schulen.org/Probst/PDF/Christoph%20Probst.pdf |archivedate=November 29, 2006 |df= }} p 3 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; Christoph's sister, Angelika, remembers that her brother was strongly critical of Nazi ideas that violated human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/vermischtes/article13436458/Im-Schatten-der-Geschwister-Scholl.html ''Im Schatten der Geschwister Scholl'']. In: Die Welt, 18 June 2011 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Probst went to [[boarding school]] at [[Staatliches Landschulheim Marquartstein|Marquartstein]] and [[Landheim Schondorf]], which was also not conducive to fostering Nazi German ideas, and at 17, he matriculated. After [[Armed forces|military service]], he began his medical studies with great earnestness. Aged 21, he married Herta Dohrn, with whom he had three children: Michael, Vincent and Katja.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/biographie/view-bio/christoph-probst/?no_cache=1 ''Christoph Probst''], Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand, gdw-berlin.de&lt;/ref&gt;

Christoph Probst came rather late into the White Rose as he did not belong to the same student corps as [[Hans Scholl]], [[Alexander Schmorell]] and [[Willi Graf]], and stayed for the most part in the background, as he had to think of his family. He wrote some of the text for the White Rose's leaflet which [[Hans Scholl]] was carrying with him when he and his sister [[Sophie Scholl|Sophie]] went to the university on 18 February 1943 to distribute leftover copies of the sixth leaflet.&lt;ref name=bpb/&gt;

When the Scholl siblings were arrested at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]], the Gestapo acquired proof against Probst. Before his execution he requested to be and was [[Baptism|baptized]] by a [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|Roman Catholic]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]].&lt;ref name=bpb&gt;[http://www.bpb.de/geschichte/nationalsozialismus/weisse-rose/60975/christoph-probst Christoph Probst Biographie] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; He was executed on 22 February 1943, along with Hans and Sophie Scholl, despite asking for clemency during interrogation. He also requested a trial for the sake of his wife and three children, who were aged three years, two years and four weeks old. His wife, Herta Probst, was sick with [[childbed fever]] at the time.

On 3 November 1999, Christoph Probst was included in the [[martyrology]] of the Catholic church.&lt;ref&gt;Moll, Helmut  (Hrsg. im Auftrag der Deutschen Bischofskonferenz), (2015). ''Zeugen für Christus. Das deutsche Martyrologium des 20. Jahrhunderts'', 6., erweiterte und neu strukturierte Auflage Paderborn u.a., {{ISBN|978-3-506-78080-5}}, volume I, pp. 507–509&lt;/ref&gt;

Christoph Probst was portrayed by Florian Stetter in the film ''[[Sophie Scholl: The Final Days]]''.

[[File:Ballard Farmers' Market - vegetables.jpg|right|thumb|The [[marketplace]] is an example of community-based trade.]]
'''Community-based economics''' or '''community economics''' is an economic system that encourages '''local substitution'''. It is most similar to the [[lifeway]]s of those practicing [[voluntary simplicity]], including traditional [[Mennonite]], [[Amish]], and modern [[eco-village]] communities. It is also a subject in [[urban economics]], related to [[moral purchasing]] and [[local purchasing]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Various specific programs for community economics and [[local currency]], e.g. [[Ithaca Hours]], are often promoted in [[green politics]]. Notably, the [[Ten Key Values of the Green Party]] include them as fundamental parts of a green program.

Recently, the more mainstream approach of [[Independent Business Alliance]] organizing has spread across the U.S., helping independent, locally owned businesses compete effectively and countering the spread of corporate chains at the local level.

'''Cram''' is an application for [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[OS X]] and [[iOS]] developed by Patrick Chukwura and Ashli Norton of SimpleLeap Software.

The software is a [[flashcard]] application which allows users to prepare for various types of subject matter using flashcards and multiple choice tests. By entering the question and answer of the test in Cram, the application presents the information in test or flashcard format, which then allows the user to study the entered information at any time.

Apart from the core functionality of Cram, other features of the application include the use of images and sound that are integrated on the flashcard and practice tests as they study and test database that allows the user to download and share tests with other users.

Cram also provides functions to study from an iPhone with flashcards and multiple-choice tests.

Cram is available as [[shareware]], which will block itself after creating five tests with five questions each.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8548">'''Design-based learning''' ('''DBL'''), also known as '''design-based instruction''', is an [[inquiry-based learning|inquiry-based]] form of learning, or [[pedagogy]], that is based on integration of [[design thinking]] and the [[design process]] into the classroom at the [[K-12]] and [[post-secondary]] levels.&lt;ref name="Edutopia1"&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/inquiry-project-learning-research Powerful Learning: Studies Show Deep Understanding Derives from Collaborative Methods, By Brigid Barron, Linda Darling-Hammond, in Edutopia, October 8, 2008].

Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;  Design-based [[learning environment]]s can be found across many disciplines, including those traditionally associated with design (e.g. art, architecture, engineering, interior design, graphic design), as well as others not normally considered to be design-related (science, technology, business, humanities).&lt;ref name="Edutopia2"&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/pdfs/edutopia-teaching-for-meaningful-learning.pdf ''Teaching for meaningful learning,'' Edutopia].

Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;  DBL, as well as [[project-based learning]] and [[problem-based learning]], is used to teach [[21st century skills]] such as [[communication]] and [[collaboration]] and foster [[deeper learning]].&lt;ref name="KSBE"&gt;[http://www.ksbe.edu/_assets/spi/pdfs/21_century_skills_full.pdf  ''21st Century Skills - for Students and Teachers'', Research and Evaluation, August 2010, Kamehameha Schools].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeper learning is supported when students design and create an artifact that requires understanding and application of knowledge. DBL activity supports [[iteration]] as students create, assess, and redesign their projects. The work's complexity often requires collaboration and specialized roles, providing students with the opportunity to become “experts” in a particular area.  Design projects require students to establish goals and constraints, generate ideas, and create prototypes through [[storyboarding]] or other representational practices.&lt;ref name="Edutopia1" /&gt; [[Robotics]] competitions in schools are popular design-based learning activities, wherein student teams design, build and then pilot their robots in competitive challenges. 
 
Design-based learning was developed in the 1980s by Doreen Nelson, a professor at [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona]] and the [[Art Center College of Design]]. Her findings suggested that [[Kinesthetic learning|kinesthetic problem-solving]] helps students acquire, retain, and synthesize information in practical ways.&lt;ref&gt;[https://centerx.gseis.ucla.edu/partnerships-grants/tiip/showcase/virgil-project-portfolio/design-based-learning Design based learning, UCLA].

==Design process==
{{main article|Design process}}
The design process is an iterative process that has a variety of sequential steps:&lt;ref name="Mehalik"&gt;[http://www.lrdc.pitt.edu/Schunn/research/papers/MehaliketalJEE2008.pdf ''Middle-School Science Through Design- Based Learning versus Scripted Inquiry: Better Overall Science Concept Learning and Equity Gap Reduction'', Mehalik, Doppelt, Schunn.  Journal of Engineering Education, January 2008].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;

*identify needs
*develop criteria
*generate alternatives

[[File:ADDIE Model of Design.jpg|right|thumb|300px|ADDIE Model]]
A similar approach is the [[ADDIE Model]] of [[instructional design]], a framework of generic processes used by instructional designers and [[Training and development|training developers]].&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Gary R. Designing Effective Instruction, 6th Edition. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It represents a descriptive guideline with five distinct phases:
* Analysis
* Design
* Development
* Implementation
* Evaluation

==Results==
Positive benefits of the design-based learning approach have been observed, including student-based learning where students (often) identify their project's needs, develop their own ideas, and engage in a larger range of thinking than with the traditional scripted inquiry model.&lt;ref name="Mehalik" /&gt; The results from the 2008 study by Mehalik et al. found significant improvement in student performance using the DBL model compared to the scripted model.&lt;ref name="Mehalik" /&gt;  A 1998 study (Fraser, Fraser &amp; Tobin, 1991) suggest that DBL has the potential to increase students’ desire to learn, enhance success in science class, and increase  interest in science topics. Students were observed to be engaged in DBL and the lower-achieving students were able to explain concepts at higher levels than previously observed by their teacher. In-depth experience in design activities and creation of meaningful outcomes in technology were observed in terms of the finished product, documentation, and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JTE/v19n2/doppelt ''Engagement and Achievements:  A Case Study of Design-Based Learning in a Science Context,'' Doppelt, Mehalik, Schunn, Silk, Krysinski].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Significant benefits of implementing DBL has been observed in the areas of math and science (Darling-Hammond et al., 2008).&lt;ref name="KSBE" /&gt;  Research has found that students who participate in learning by design projects have a more systematic understanding of a system’s parts and functions that control groups (Hmelo, Holton, &amp; Kolodner, 2000).&lt;ref name="KSBE" /&gt;

A 2000 study (Hmelo, Holton, and Kolodner) found that the design project led to better learning outcomes and included deeper learning than the traditional learning approach. The researchers also noted that the students developed greater understanding of complex systems.  The study found that in using DBL, both higher-achieving and lower-achieving students showed strong evidence of progress in learning the targeted concepts, students were able to apply key concepts in their work, and there were positive effects on motivation and sense of ownership over work product by both groups and individual students.&lt;ref name="Edutopia1" /&gt;

==Implementation==
The teaching of [[21st century skills]] is more effective when teachers gain expertise in both the practice and the teaching of these skills, in effect becoming successful 21st century learners in the areas of:  communication and collaboration amongst teachers and with students; being flexible with new classroom dynamics; fostering independent student learning; adapting teaching and learning styles to new pedagogical approaches.

Challenges to implementing DBL include developing the skills of the instructors:&lt;ref name="KSBE" /&gt; 
* teachers' ability to select topics and activities that support, and benefit from, differing viewpoints and students' real-world experiences 
* selecting students who will work well together
* setting of effective ground rules to ensure equal opportunities to participate, 
* encouraging multiple strategies to foster full participation for all members of a group of team.

'''eXeLearning''' is a free / libre software tool under GPL-2 that can be used to create educational interactive web content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eXeLearning web page|url=http://exelearning.net/?lang=en|publisher=INTEF|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

eXeLearning can generate interactive contents in [[XHTML]] or [[HTML5]] format. It allows you to create easily navigable web pages including text, images, interactive activities, image galleries or multimedia clips.

eXeLearning, available for Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Download eXeLearning|url=http://exelearning.net/downloads/|publisher=INTEF|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows you to create or develop accessible contents in XHTML or HTML5 format, to generate complete websites (navigable web pages), to include interactive contents (different types of questions and activities) in each page, to export the contents in different formats such as [[EPUB|ePub3]] (an open standard for e-books),
IMS or [[SCORM]] (educational standards used to publish interactive contents in platforms or elearning tools as Moodle or any other [[Open educational resources|OER]] (Open Educational Resources) repositories or [[XLIFF]] (standard for translation).
To classify, or to catalog, educational contents according to different [[metadata]] models: [[Dublin Core]], LOM, LOM-ES.
When exported as Web Site, we can create web pages that can be viewed in different digital devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops....)
And all this stuff, and much more, without knowing anything about programming.

==History==

eXeLearning was originally developed in New Zealand, in 2007, and was led by two universities (University of Auckland and Auckland University of Technology) and the Tairawhiti Polytechnic Institute. The project was originally supported by the New Zealand government, and it was later supported by many other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eXe original proyect|url=http://exelearning.org/|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original project remained active until 2010. At that time eXeLearning had thousands of users and it was a very well known authoring tool in educational environments.

In 2009-2010, the Instituto de Tecnologías Educativas del Ministerio de Educación del Gobierno de España (now INTEF&lt;ref&gt;http://educalab.es/intef&lt;/ref&gt;) decided to restart and to evolve the project. The new eXeLearning, as it was named, would keep alive the original open source spirit of the project, adapting the application to new web developments and standards and introducing major improvements.

A new eXeLearning website was developed, a site that allows the users to actively participate in the project: make contributions, suggestions, find answers to different questions....

Now the project is, again, alive and kicking, and it is supported by different government agencies and companies, both in Spain and in other countries all over the world. As it can be seen with the recent release, last September, of eXeLearning 2.0.

==eXeLearning previous release==

In 2013 eXeLearning evolved as a web development, web application or tool, (written in Python + Ext JS) that can be used with the default or preferred browser of the user, capable to work, or to be executed, in different browsers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eXeLearning 7. New release|url=http://cedec.ite.educacion.es/kubyx/2013/03/11/89-nueva-version-de-exelearning-7||publisher=CeDeC|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eXeLearning inicia una nueva etapa|url=http://www.educacontic.es/blog/exelearning-inicia-una-nueva-etapa-se-renueva-completamente|publisher=Educa con TIC|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the new eXeLearning has experienced major advances:

*Improvements in accessibility and presentation of contents.
*Replacement of the internal format used in eXe: the original version used a closed binary format and it has been changed to an open XML format.
*New option to export in XLIFF format to facilitate the translation of contents.
*Development of a command line version (exe_do) to facilitate the publishing and maintenance of contents through scripts.
*The Ability to generate editable SCORM packages with the tool itself.

==eXeLearning 2.0 &amp; 2.1==
However, the innovations included in the new release are the main reasons that let the development team to move forward from version 1 to version 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eXeLearning se hace adulto, se presenta la versión 2.0|url=http://www.educacontic.es/blog/exelearning-se-hace-adulto-se-presenta-la-version-2-0|publisher=Educa con TIC|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Configuration==
*Language management: we can work with eXeLearning in one language and generate content in another.
*It lets you choose the browser to work with.
*Advanced options:
**You can choose the type of document: XHTML or (the greatest improvement) HTML5.
**You can choose the level of tolerance of the text editor: Strict mode only allows XHTML or valid HTML5, Permissive mode allows us to enter any code.

==iDevices==

iDevices are the tools or blocks that can be included in our pages.

eXeLearning 2.0 significantly improves its level of accessibility. Now it is much easier to generate accessible contents.
User experience has also improved: now the iDevices are grouped by categories and it is easier to select them. We can also hide those who do not wish to use or show less common iDevices that can be interesting for us.
Improvements in iDevices such as Image Gallery or Image Magnifier and proprietary solutions and / or Flash based are replaced.
New iDevices are included.

==JavaScript and Styles==

*jQuery is included in all contents generated.
*Import and export of Styles allowed.
*Responsive design. Now you can find Styles that can fit any device (smartphones, tablets, laptops....).
*Styles let you include JavaScript and customized HTML code.
*Some Styles let you hide Menu or minimize iDevices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolución en los estilos de eXeLearning|url=http://blog.educalab.es/intef/2014/12/12/evolucion-en-los-estilos-de-exelearning/|publisher=INTEF|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application handling==

Preview option: now you don't need to export to see the content edited so far.

==Text editor==
*Layout by columns (tableless).
*New video and audio formats: mp4, ogv/ogg, webm, mp3, ogg, wav.
*The attribution and licensing is provided with the new option that allows users to add information in headers and footers of images, videos and audios.
*It is possible to use the Lightbox effect from the editor itself using the "rel" attribute in links.
*Now it is possible to export in two new formats:
**SCORM 2004 (educational standard)
**ePub3 (e-books standard)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La nueva versión de eXeLearning permite exportar a ePub3|url=http://blog.educalab.es/intef/2014/11/04/la-nueva-version-de-exelearning-permite-exportar-a-epub3/|publisher=INTEF|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roadmap==
The future of eXeLearning involves the incorporation of new iDevices and Styles, including a tool for editing in real time, the replacement of all the fragments of code that are not compatible with the GPL-2 license, improvements in the import of content generated by other tools, and to become a genuine web service connected with different platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roadmap eXeLearning.net|url=http://exelearning.net/features/#tab2|publisher=eXeLearning.net|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The levels of '''education in [[Åland Islands|Åland]]''' are [[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education|higher]] education. Education is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 15. Compulsory education consists of six years of primary and three years of lower secondary education. Upon completion of the third year of lower secondary education students can continue to the upper secondary education which is carried out by the Ålands Gymnasium. Higher education is offered at the [[Åland University of Applied Sciences]]. Education in [[Åland Islands|Åland]] is administered and regulated by the Ministry of Education and Culture ({{lang-sv|Undervisnings-och kulturministeriet }}).

==Overview==
[[Swedish language|Swedish]] is the primary language of instruction in Åland. From 2001 to 2014, the percentage of compulsory schools' pupils that don't take courses in any other language than Swedish has increased from 16.8% to 31.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.asub.ax/files/ut24en.xls| title=Pupils in comprehensive school, senior level, studying no, one or two voluntary languages by school 2001-2014, per cent| publisher=ÅSUM - Statistics and Research Åland| accessdate=1 May 2015}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the public spending on education was 53.932 million [[Euro]]s, or 4.7 of [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asub.ax/files/OF01en.xls | title=Expenditure of the Government of Åland 2000-2013, 1 000 EUR | publisher=ÅSUB - Statistics and Research Åland | accessdate=1 May 2015 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 there were 657 teachers employed in all levels of education in Åland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asub.ax/files/UT08en.xls | title=Number of teachers by level of school, position, sex and average age spring term 2014 | publisher=ÅSUM - Statistics and Research Åland | accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total enrollment in Åland was 4,491 students in 2014.&lt;ref name="primarynumber"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asub.ax/files/UT01en.xls | title=Pupils in comprehensive school by sex and grade autumn 2014 | publisher=ÅSUB - Statistics and Research Åland | accessdate=2 May 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="highnumbers"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asub.ax/files/UT02en.xls | title=Students in education after comprehensive school and at the Åland University of Applied Sciences autumn term 2000-2014 | publisher=ÅSUB - Statistics and Research Åland | accessdate=2 May 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Faculty of Law''' of the University of Tirana is one of six [[Faculty (division)|faculties]] of the [[University of Tirana]].  Being the premier [[law school]] in the country, and one of the oldest higher education institutions in the [[Albania|country]], it conducts both undergraduate and post-graduate degree programs in the field law.

== History ==

[[File:Unitir Drejtesi.jpg|500px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The façade of the Faculty of Law, University of Tirana&lt;/center&gt;]]

The ''Faculty of Law'' was established in 1954 as the "High Institute for Legal Studies".&lt;ref name="Historik"&gt;[http://fdut.edu.al/?page_id=480 Fakulteti i Drejtësisë: Historiku] (albanian)&lt;/ref&gt;  After the establishment of the [[University of Tirana|State University of Tirana]], the ''High Institute for Legal Studies'' was incorporated into the wider university structure as one of seven faculties, and renamed as the '''Faculty of Law''.  In 1965, the university was once again reorganized and the ''Faculty of Law'' was merged with the Department of Political Science, to form a bigger "Faculty of Political Science and Law". The new faculty sought to prepare specialists in political science, who were to serve as [[civil servant]]s for the central and local organs of government and legal specialists, to serve in the judiciary and prosecution service.  In 1967, the Faculty opened [[journalism]] course, which was to prepare journalists for the government-owned newspapers and for the newly established [[Radio Televizioni Shqiptar|Albanian Radio and Television]].

During the 1970s, the faculty was again reorganized, with the courses of [[political science]] transferred to a newly created department and [[philosophy]] brought under the ambit of the Faculty.  In 1991, the faculty was renamed as the "Faculty of Law" once again, to reflect the fact that law degrees and philosophy were divided into two separate faculties, while the journalism degree was transferred to the Faculty of History and Philology.

Until the 1970s, the normal duration of studies was four years, but later it was reduced to three years of study, followed by a year of practical training in the courts. In the 1980s, the faculty returned to the four year study system.  The most dramatic changes occurred after the [[Fall of communism in Albania|fall of communism]] in Albania in 1991. The arrival of new concepts dealing with [[liberal democracy|democracy]], the [[rule of law]] and [[equality before the law]], necessitated deep reforms in the academic and educational conception of the law and of the role of the lawyer.  Thus, starting from 1991 the curriculum was developed according to Western models, and after 2000 there were efforts to transition the degrees offered by the Faculty to the [[Bologna process]], thus now the ''Faculty of Law'' offers [[Bachelor of laws]], [[Master of laws]] and [[PhD|PhD in Law]] degrees.

The Deans of the ''Faculty of Law'' throughout the years are as follows:&lt;ref name="Historik" /&gt;
* Luan Omari,
* Zija Xholi, 
* Ismail Lleshi, 
* Kudret Çela (first term), 
* Valentina Zaçe, 
* Kudret Çela (second term), 
* Ksenofon Krisafi, 
* Vasilika Hysi,
* Kudret Çela (third term),
* Altin Shegani,
* Artan Hoxha.

== Enrollment ==

In recent years, the number of admissions to the Faculty of Law has grown substantially, with the ''Faculty of Law'' being attended by a total of 5000 students in its three levels of study.  In order to be accepted, students must have completed the [[Matura Shtetërore]] and win a place in the Acceptance Examinations, which are held every year in September.&lt;ref name="Historik" /&gt;

'''Francis Lister Hawks Pott''' ({{zh|t=卜舫濟}}; February 22, 1864 – March 7, 1947) was an American Episcopal missionary and educator in China. He served as President of St. John's College (later renamed [[St. John's University, Shanghai|St. John's University]]), one of China's oldest and most prestigious universities, from 1888 until 1941. With the outbreak of the [[Pacific War]] in 1941 and the Japanese occupation of the [[Shanghai International Settlement]], he left for the United States. After World War II, he returned to Shanghai, but soon died in 1947.

Pott was married to Soo Ngoo Wong ({{zh|t=黃素娥|p=Huáng Sù'é}}), who died in 1918, and the father of Olivia H. Pott and Walter Graham Hawks Pott.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54661">The '''Harveian Oration''' is a yearly lecture held at the [[Royal College of Physicians|Royal College of Physicians of London]]. It was instituted in 1656 by [[William Harvey]], discoverer of the systemic circulation. Harvey made financial provision for the college to hold an annual feast on St. Luke's Day (18 October) at which an oration would be delivered in Latin to praise the college's benefactors and ''to exhort the Fellows and Members of this college to search and study out the secrets of nature by way of experiment''. Until 1865, the Oration was given in Latin, as Harvey had specified, and known as the ''Oratio anniversaria''; but it was thereafter spoken in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bmj.2.4007.783 | pmc = 2087562| title = Harveian Oration: Physiology of the Stomach | year = 1937 | last1 = Hurst | first1 = A. | journal = BMJ | volume = 2 | pages = 783–9| pmid=20780984 | issue=4007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the lectures were published in book form.

'''Henry Morris''' (1889 &amp;ndash; 14 December 1961) is known primarily as the founder of [[village college]]s. He was the Chief Education Officer for [[Cambridgeshire]] for over thirty years, taking up the post in 1922 during a time of depression in the [[United Kingdom]] following the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=hm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henrymorris.plus.com/henrymorris.html|title=Henry Morris|publisher=The Henry Morris Memorial Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Morris was born in [[Southport]] in [[Lancashire]] in 1889. At the age of fourteen he began work as an office boy at ''The Southport Visiter'', later becoming a reporter. In 1910 he moved to [[St David's University College]], [[Lampeter]] to read for a degree in [[theology]], and in 1912 moved to [[Exeter College, Oxford]]. At the outbreak of the [[First World War]] he volunteered for army service, and became an officer in the [[Royal Army Service Corps|RASC]]. In 1919 following the end of the war he read [[philosophy]] at [[King's College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-morr.htm|title=Henry Morris|publisher=infed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After a year as Assistant Secretary, Henry Morris took up the post of Secretary of Education for Cambridgeshire in 1922. At one point during the Great Depression, Cambridgeshire was the second poorest county in England, despite the relative wealth of the university. Education outside of the City of [[Cambridge]] was in a poor state due to lack of funding, with no separate secondary schools in the countryside; all children between the ages of three and fourteen were educated in their village school-house, often in one room and by the same, single teacher for their entire school career. Morris envisioned integrated between secondary and community education accessible by all those living in the villages and small towns around Cambridgeshire: the idea of 'village colleges'. He described this as "raising the school leaving age to ninety", and firmly believed that education, both formal and informal, should be a lifelong process. In the 1930s his visions materialised as the village colleges he had initially only hoped for, and the first four village colleges in Cambridgeshire were opened before the country became heavily involved in the conflicts of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=hm/&gt;

[[File:The Old Granary Darwin College Cambridge.jpg|thumb|The Old Granary, [[Silver Street, Cambridge]], Morris's home until 1946, where he is commemorated by a [[blue plaque]]]]
Until 1946, Morris lived at The Old Granary in [[Silver Street, Cambridge]], where he was the tenant of [[Maud Darwin]], daughter-in-law of the naturalist [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spalding|first=Frances|title=Gwen Raverat: Friends, Family and Affections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WPwcNbrneJkC&amp;pg=PA387|date=30 November 2010|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-2941-0|page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[blue plaque]] on the house commemorates Morris.

Henry Morris' idea evolved from what was initially seen by many in the government as a radical, liberal, paternalistic approach to delivering secondary education; to a system of education that was adopted by many other counties within the United Kingdom and abroad, due to its proven success in Cambridgeshire. By the time of his death in 1962, there were many village colleges successfully delivering education to both secondary school students (11- to 16-year-olds), and members of their local communities of all ages.

Today the concept lives on to great success in Cambridgeshire and many other areas of the country. Comberton Village College in South Cambridgeshire has, in several recent years, been at or near the top of the league tables for state comprehensive schools in England.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}}  The system of whole community education, as used by Comberton Village College, was complimented by British Prime Minister, [[Tony Blair]] - a true reflection of the success of Henry Morris' concept.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}}

He died on 10 December 1961 at Hill End Hospital, St Albans, where he had spent his last months; a simple cremation ceremony at [[Golders Green Crematorium]] took place on 14 December 1961. 

==Village colleges==

The following village colleges were founded by Morris.

*[[Sawston Village College]] (1930)
*[[Bottisham Village College]] (1937)
*[[Linton Village College]] (1937)
*[[Impington Village College]] (1939)
*[[Bassingbourn Village College]] (1954)

Two further colleges were opened by him shortly after his retirement from the post in 1954.

*[[Soham Village College]] (1958)
*[[Comberton Village College]] (1959)

==Henry Morris Trust==

In order to commemorate the life works, and achievements of Henry Morris, a group of his friends decided to create a memorial to him that they felt he would be truly proud of. They established a trust fund, with the objective of promoting enjoyment in the form of independent travel and study among the youth of the City of Cambridge, East Cambridgeshire and South Cambridgeshire. The trust fund, for several decades now, has annually awarded grants usually ranging from £20-£200 per person for self organised projects involving travel abroad or home based interests. It is possible to receive a grant from the trust if you are aged thirteen to nineteen, are a student or permanent resident of the City of Cambridge, East Cambridgeshire or South Cambridgeshire, and wish to pursue an interest either from home or abroad.&lt;ref name=hm/&gt;

'''Ionideios''' (or Ionidios) '''School of Piraeus''' ({{lang-el|Ιωνίδειος Σχολή Πειραιά}} {{IPA-el|ioniðios sxoʎ pir̥ea}}) is a school in [[Piraeus]], Greece. It was founded in 1847, and it was named after the Greek national benefactor Constantinos Ionides, father of [[Alexander Constantine Ionides]].

==History==
Ionideios was established in 1847. However, its history began in 1844, when the Mayor of Piraeus was Petros Omiridis Skylitsis, who addressed to Konstantinos Ionidis by letter he asked for help in setting up schools in [[Piraeus]]. In his reply to the mayor, Constantinos Ionides stated that he would provide 30,000 [[drachmas]], an amount of great importance at the time, provided that the Municipality of Piraeus would purchase the land pay for the future cost of the school in order to function. In 1845 the City Council accepted these terms together with some others that the donor had set.

Two years later, in 1847 and on the mayoralty of Dimitrios Theocharis, the construction of the school began and on 21 May of the same year while the donor provided 10,000 [[drachmas]] more for the needs of the school and the creation of a library. In 1862, the establishment of the Gymnasium was signed by the then Minister of Education. Until 1914 the school housed the only Gymnasium in Piraeus. This year, with the foundation of the Second Gymnasium in the city of Piraeus, Ionides renamed the school to First Gymnasium. The Gymnasium operated in the original building of 1847 until 1932, when it was demolished, in order to erect in its place the building in which it is housed today. In 1963, the Minister of Education, Grigorios Kasimatis renames the school to Ionideios Model School of Piraeu. Since 1986 the official name is set to be "Experimental Gymnasium and Lyceum of Ionideios" and it is usually referred to as "Ionideios High School of Piraeus".&lt;ref&gt;http://lyk-peir-ionid.att.sch.gr/istoria.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.esos.gr/arthra/54790/ionideios-sholi-peiraia-170-hronia-istorias-kai-prosforas-stin-elliniki-paideia&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enrollment==
Every year the [[Ministry of Education, Research and Religious Affairs|Greek ministry of education]] organises exams for the 17 model schools of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.minedu.gov.gr/publications/docs2014/140403_pps_perf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tovima.gr/files/1/2013/19/peir.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The students apply for one of the 17 schools. One of them is Ionideios which accepts the 108 best students of these exams who applied for Ionideios. In case a student leaves the school for any reason before their graduation a special exam is organised in order to find the student who is going to replace the student who left.&lt;ref&gt;http://lyk-peir-ionid.att.sch.gr/diad_eisag.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
The building of the School is located on the western side of the building square that is formed by Korai Square, Iroon Polytechniou str. and Sotiros Dios str., in the center of Piraeus. Students and teachers use the entrance of 17, Sotiros Dios Street.
On the ground floor are the concierge, the canteen, the Event Hall and the Gymnasium's Computer Laboratory.
On the first floor is the courtyard, indoor gymnasium, the Chemistry Lab, 4 classrooms, which are used by the first grade of Lyceum, the Multimedia Lab and the Library.
On the second floor are the offices of the Directors, the Deputy Directors, the Secretariats and the Office of the Teachers, four classes of teaching, which are used by the 2nd grade of Lyceum, as well as the Physics and Biology Laboratories.
On the third floor there are twelve classrooms, which are used by the entire Gymnasium as well as another computer lab.
On the fourth floor, there are four classrooms, which are used by the Third Grade of Lyceum, as well as a robotics lab.
More than half of the rooms are equipped with interactive whiteboards.&lt;ref&gt;http://lyk-peir-ionid.att.sch.gr/building.html&lt;/ref&gt;
===Library===
At Ionideios there is a library from the first years of its foundation, which is one of the largest School Libraries in Greece. It has an area of 90 sqm and contains 24 bookshelves.

The library houses 2 collections, the old collection of Ioneidos and the newest one. The old collection lists 5,556 titles, according to the latest census of 1999, when the new School Library was funded under the EU's 2nd Community Support Framework. At that time the old collection was enriched with 4,600 titles and audiovisual material. The new library is continuously enriched with new material and to date it contains over 13,000 books and audiovisual material as well as magazines of varied content. In addition, electronic book search can be done through ABEKT's electronic automation system at the [[National Documentation Centre (Greece)|National Documentation Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;http://lyk-peir-ionid.att.sch.gr/building.html&lt;/ref&gt;

All library material is classified with the US DEWEY decimal system and is managed through the ABEKT system.

===Computer Laboratories===
The Gymnasium's computer laboratory is located on the ground floor of the building and is equipped with a network of 12 workstations connected to a central computer. The Multimedia Hall, on the first floor, is a multi-purpose lab. In it take place the computer courses of Lyceum, as well as the lessons of other Lyceum courses.

==Early life and education==
Judith Butler was born on February 24, 1956, in [[Cleveland, Ohio]],&lt;ref name="Duignan 2018"/&gt; to a family of Hungarian-Jewish and Russian-Jewish descent.&lt;ref name=2001int&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lolapress.org/elec2/artenglish/butl_e.htm | title=Interview with Judith Butler| author=Regina Michalik | work=Lola Press | date= May 2001 | accessdate=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her maternal grandmother's family perished in the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=taught&gt;{{cite journal|last=Udi|first=Aloni|title=Judith Butler: As a Jew, I was taught it was ethically imperative to speak up|journal=Haaretz|date=24 February 2010|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/judith-butler-as-a-jew-i-was-taught-it-was-ethically-imperative-to-speak-up-1.266243|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child and teenager, she attended both [[Hebrew school]] and special classes on [[Jewish ethics]], where she received her "first training in philosophy". Butler stated in a 2010 interview with ''[[Haaretz]]'' that she began the ethics classes at the age of 14 and that they were created as a form of punishment by her Hebrew school's [[Rabbi]] because she was "too talkative in class".&lt;ref name=taught/&gt;  Butler also stated that she was "thrilled" by the idea of these tutorials, and when asked what she wanted to study in these special sessions, she responded with three questions preoccupying her at the time: "Why was [[Spinoza]] [[excommunication|excommunicated]] from the synagogue? Could [[German Idealism]] be held accountable for [[Nazism]]? And how was one to understand [[existential theology]], including the work of [[Martin Buber]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judith Butler and Michael Roth: A Conversation at Wesleyan University's Center for Humanities|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf4px4KyqbY|publisher=Wesleyan University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler attended [[Bennington College]] before transferring to [[Yale University]], where she studied philosophy, receiving her [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1978 and her [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in 1984.&lt;ref name="tanner"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://grad.berkeley.edu/tanner/0405.shtml| title=Tanner Lecture on Human Values: 2004–2005 Lecture Series| work=UC Berkeley | date= March 2005| accessdate=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent one academic year at [[Heidelberg University]] as a [[Fulbright]] Scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Eva von Redecker: ''Zur Aktualität von Judith Butler.

===''Performative Acts and Gender Constitution'' (1988)===
In the essay "Performative Acts and Gender Constitution", Judith Butler proposes that [[gender performativity|gender is a performance]]. She draws on the phenomenology of [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and the feminism of [[Simone de Beauvoir]], noting that both thinkers ground their theories in "lived experience" and view the sexual body as a historical idea or situation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|last = Butler|first = Judith|date = 1988 |journal = Theatre Journal |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=519–531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler distinguishes "between sex, as biological facticity, and gender, as the cultural interpretation or signification of that facticity."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Butler argues that gender is best perceived as a performance, which suggests that it has a social audience. For Butler, the "script" of gender performance is effortlessly transmitted generation to generation in the form of socially established "meanings": She states, "gender is not a radical choice ... [nor is it] imposed or inscribed upon the individual".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Given the social nature of human beings, most actions are witnessed, reproduced, and internalized and thus take on a performative or theatric quality. According to Butler's theory, gender is essentially a performative repetition of acts associated with the male or female. Currently, the actions appropriate for men and women have been transmitted to produce a social atmosphere that both maintains and legitimizes a seemingly natural gender binary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Consistently with her acceptance of the body as a historical idea, she suggests that our concept of gender is seen as natural or innate because the body "becomes its gender through a series of acts which are renewed, revised, and consolidated through time".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Butler argues that the performance of gender itself creates gender. Additionally, she compares the performativity of gender to the performance of the theater. She brings many similarities, including the idea of each individual functioning as an actor of their gender. However, she also brings to light a critical difference between gender performance in reality and theater performances. She explains how the theater is much less threatening and does not produce the same fear that gender performances often encounter because of the fact that there is a clear distinction from reality within the theater.

Butler uses [[Sigmund Freud]]'s notion of how a person's identity is modeled in terms of the normal. She revises Freud's notion of this concept's applicability to lesbianism, where Freud says that lesbians are modeling their behavior on men, the perceived normal or ideal. She instead says that all gender works in this way of performativity and a representing of an internalized notion of gender norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rivkin, Julie, and Michael Ryan.

===''Gender Trouble'' (1990)===
{{Main|Gender Trouble}}

''Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity'' was first published in 1990, selling over 100,000 copies internationally, in multiple languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Loizidou |first1=Elena |title=Judith Butler: Ethics, Law, Politics |date=2007 |publisher=Routledge |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's title alludes to the 1974 [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] film ''Female Trouble'', which stars the [[drag queen]] [[Divine (Glen Milstead)|Divine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |origyear=1990 |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |pages=xxviii–xxix |nopp=true |isbn=84-493-2030-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gender Trouble'' discusses the works of Freud, de Beauvoir, [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Monique Wittig]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Michel Foucault]]. The book has even inspired an intellectual fanzine, ''Judy!''&lt;ref&gt;[[Larissa MacFarquhar]], "Putting the Camp Back into Campus," ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' (September/October 1993); see also Judith Butler, "Decamping," ''Lingua Franca'' (November–December 1993). Reprinted in ''Quick Studies: The Best of Lingua Franca,'' Farrar Straus Giroux, 2002, pp. 71–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crux of Butler's argument in ''Gender Trouble'' is that the coherence of the categories of sex, [[sociology of gender|gender]], and sexuality—the natural-seeming coherence, for example, of masculine gender and heterosexual desire in male bodies—is culturally constructed through the repetition of stylized acts in time. Although the repeated, stylized bodily acts establish the appearance of an essential, [[ontology|ontological]] "core" gender, Butler understands gender, along with sex and sexuality, to be [[performative]]. Butler explicitly challenges biological accounts of binary sex.&lt;ref&gt;For Butler's critique of biological accounts of sexual difference as a ruse for the cultural construction of "natural" sex, see {{cite book|title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|last=Butler|first=Judith|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=84-493-2030-5|location=New York|pages=135–41|chapter=Concluding Unscientific Postscript|authorlink=Judith Butler|origyear=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance of gender is not voluntary, in Butler's opinion, and she believes the gendered, sexed, desiring subject must be constructed within what she calls, borrowing from Foucault's ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'', "regulative [[discourse]]s." These, also called "frameworks of intelligibility" or "disciplinary regimes," determine in advance what possibilities of sex, gender, and sexuality are socially permitted to appear as coherent or "natural."{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Regulative discourse includes [[Discipline and Punish#Discipline|disciplinary techniques]] that coerce the stylized actions and thereby maintain the appearance of "core" gender, sex and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Butler explicitly formulates her theory of [[performativity]] in the final pages of ''Gender Trouble'', specifically in the final section of her chapter "Subversive Bodily Acts" entitled "Bodily Inscriptions, Performative Subversions" and elaborates performativity in relation to the question of political agency in her conclusion, "From Parody to Politics." See {{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |origyear=1990 |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |pages=171–90 |isbn=84-493-2030-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supposed obviousness of sex as a natural fact attests to how deeply its production in discourse is concealed. The sexed body, once established as a natural fact, is the alibi for constructions of gender and sexuality, which then purport to be the just-as-natural expressions or consequences of sex. In Butler's account, it is on the basis of the construction of natural binary sex that binary gender and heterosexuality are likewise constructed as natural.&lt;ref&gt;For Butler's discussion of the performative co-construction of sex and gender see {{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |origyear=1990 |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=163–71, 177–8 |isbn=84-493-2030-5}} The signification of sex is also addressed in connection with [[Monique Wittig]] in the section "Monique Wittig: Bodily Disintegrations and Fictive Sex," pp. 141–63&lt;/ref&gt; Butler claims that without a critique of sex as produced by discourse, the [[sex/gender distinction]] as a feminist strategy for contesting constructions of binary asymmetric gender and [[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence|compulsory heterosexuality]] will be ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;For Butler's problematization of the [[sex/gender distinction]] see {{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |origyear=1990 |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=9–11, 45–9 |isbn=84-493-2030-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler offers a critique of the terms ''gender'' and ''sex'' as they have been used by feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judith Butler|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t306.e100&amp;srn=1&amp;ssid=460269119#FIRSTHIT|publisher=Oxford reference Online Premium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler argues that feminism made a mistake in trying to make "women" a discrete, ahistorical group with common characteristics. Butler writes that this approach reinforces the binary view of gender relations.  Butler believes that feminists should not try to define "women" and she also believes that feminists should "focus on providing an account of how power functions and shapes our understandings of womanhood not only in the society at large but also within the feminist movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-gender/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Butler aims to break the supposed links between sex and gender so that gender and desire can be "flexible, free floating and not caused by other stable factors". The idea of identity as free and flexible and gender as a performance, not an essence, is one of the foundations of [[Queer theory]].

===''Imitation and Gender Insubordination'' (1990)===
Judith Butler explores the production of identities such as "homosexual" and "heterosexual" and the limiting nature of identity categories. An identity category for her is a result of certain exclusions and concealments, and thus a site of regulation. Butler acknowledges, however, that categorized identities are important for political action at the present time. Butler believes that identity forms through repetition or imitation and is not original. Imitation fosters the illusion of continuity. Heterosexual identity, which is set up as an ideal, requires constant, compulsive repetition if it is to be safeguarded.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith. "Imitation and Gender Insubordination1." Cultural theory and popular culture: A reader 1 (2006): 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bodies That Matter'' (1993)===
''Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of "Sex"'' seeks to clear up readings and supposed misreadings of performativity that view the enactment of sex/gender as a daily choice.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{Cite journal | last=Jeffreys | first=Sheila | authorlink=Sheila Jeffreys | title = The queer disappearance of lesbians: Sexuality in the academy | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 459–472 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/0277-5395(94)00051-4 | date = September–October 1994 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-5395(94)00051-4 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler emphasizes the role of repetition in performativity, making use of [[Derrida]]'s theory of iterability, which is a form of [[citationality]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Performativity cannot be understood outside of a process of iterability, a regularized and constrained repetition of norms. And this repetition is not performed ''by'' a subject; this repetition is what enables a subject and constitutes the temporal condition for the subject. This iterability implies that 'performance' is not a singular 'act' or event, but a ritualized production, a ritual reiterated under and through constraint, under and through the force of prohibition and taboo, with the threat of ostracism and even death controlling and compelling the shape of the production, but not, I will insist, determining it fully in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of "Sex" |year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=95 |isbn=0-415-90365-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This concept is linked to Butler's discussion of performativity. Iterability, in its endless ''un''determinedness as to-be-determinedness, is thus precisely that aspect of performativity that makes the production of the "natural" sexed, gendered, heterosexual subject possible, while also and at the same time opening that subject up to the possibility of its incoherence and contestation.{{Technical statement|date=July 2011}}

===''Excitable Speech'' (1997)===
{{further|Performativity#Judith Butler's perspective on performativity}}

In ''Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative'', Butler surveys the problems of [[hate speech]] and censorship. She argues that censorship is difficult to evaluate, and that in some cases it may be useful or even necessary, while in others it may be worse than tolerance.&lt;ref name="Jagger"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jagger|first=Gill |title=Judith Butler: Sexual politics, social change and the power of the performative |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=115–8 |isbn=978-0-415-21975-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler argues that hate speech exists retrospectively, only after being declared such by state authorities. In this way, the state reserves for itself the power to define hate speech and, conversely, the limits of acceptable discourse. In this connection, Butler criticizes feminist legal scholar [[Catharine MacKinnon]]'s argument against pornography for its unquestioning acceptance of the state's power to censor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative|last=Butler|first=Judith|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=0-415-91588-0|location=New York|pages=22|quote="Similarly, MacKinnon's appeal to the state to construe pornogra- phy as performative speech and, hence, as the injurious conduct ofrep- resentation, does not settle the theoretical question of the relation between representation and conduct, but collapses the distinction in order to enhance the power of state intervention over graphic sexual representation."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deploying [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s argument from the first volume of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', Butler claims that any attempt at censorship, legal or otherwise, necessarily propagates the very language it seeks to forbid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=129–33 |isbn=0-415-91588-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Foucault argues, for example, the strict sexual mores of 19th century Western Europe did nothing but amplify the discourse of sexuality they sought to control.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite book |last=Foucault |first=Michel |authorlink=Michel Foucault |others=Trans. Robert Hurley |title=The History of Sexuality: An Introduction. Vol 1. |origyear=1976 |year=1990 |publisher=Vintage |location=New York | page=23 |quote=A censorship of sex? There was installed [since the 17th century] rather an apparatus for producing an ever greater quantity of discourse about sex, capable of functioning and taking effect in its very economy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extending this argument using [[Derrida]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], Butler claims that censorship is primitive to language, and that the linguistic ''I'' is a mere effect of an originary censorship. In this way, Butler questions the possibility of any genuinely oppositional discourse; "If speech depends upon censorship, then the principle that one might seek to oppose is at once the formative principle of oppositional speech".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | page=140 |isbn=0-415-91588-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Undoing Gender'' (2004)===
''[[Undoing Gender]]'' collects Butler's reflections on gender, sex, sexuality, psychoanalysis and the medical treatment of intersex people for a more general readership than many of her other books. Butler revisits and refines her notion of performativity and focuses on the question of undoing "restrictively normative conceptions of sexual and gendered life".

Butler discusses how gender is performed without one being conscious of it, but says that it does not mean this performativity is "automatic or mechanical". She argues that we have desires that do not originate from our personhood, but rather, from social norms. The writer also debates our notions of "human" and "less-than-human" and how these culturally imposed ideas can keep one from having a "viable life" as the biggest concerns are usually about whether a person will be accepted if his or her desires differ from normality. She states that one may feel the need of being recognized in order to live, but that at the same time, the conditions to be recognized make life "unlivable". The writer proposes an interrogation of such conditions so that people who resist them may have more possibilities of living.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith (2004). Undoing Gender. New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

In her discussion of intersex, Butler addresses the case of [[David Reimer]], a person whose sex was medically "reassigned" from male to female after a botched [[circumcision]] at eight months of age. Reimer was "made" female by doctors, but later in life identified as "really" male, married and became a stepfather to his wife's three children, and went on to tell his story in ''As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl'', which he wrote with John Colapinto.  Reimer committed suicide in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://slate.com/id/2101678/ | title = Gender Gap:  What were the real reasons behind David Reimer's suicide?| last = Colapinto | first = J | authorlink = John Colapinto | publisher = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date = June 3, 2004 | accessdate = February 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Giving an Account of Oneself'' (2005)===
In ''Giving an Account of Oneself'', Butler develops an ethics based on the opacity of the subject to itself; in other words, the limits of self-knowledge. Primarily borrowing from [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jean Laplanche]], [[Adriana Cavarero]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]], Butler develops a theory of the formation of the subject. She theorizes the subject in relation to the social&amp;nbsp;– a community of others and their norms – which is beyond the control of the subject it forms, as precisely the very condition of that subject's formation, the resources by which the subject becomes recognizably human, a grammatical "I", in the first place.

Butler accepts the claim that if the subject is opaque to itself the limitations of its free ethical responsibility and obligations are due to the limits of narrative, presuppositions of language and projection.

{{quote|You may think that I am in fact telling a story about the prehistory of the subject, one that I have been arguing cannot be told. There are two responses to this objection. (1) That there is no final or adequate narrative reconstruction of the prehistory of the speaking "I" does not mean we cannot narrate it; it only means that at the moment when we narrate we become speculative philosophers or fiction writers. (2) This prehistory has never stopped happening and, as such, is not a prehistory in any chronological sense. It is not done with, over, relegated to a past, which then becomes part of a causal or narrative reconstruction of the self. On the contrary, that prehistory interrupts the story I have to give of myself, makes every account of myself partial and failed, and constitutes, in a way, my failure to be fully accountable for my actions, my final "irresponsibility," one for which I may be forgiven only because I could not do otherwise. This not being able to do otherwise is our common predicament (page 78).}}

Instead she argues for an ethics based precisely on the limits of self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself. Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks the constitution of the self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to themselves and to each other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects those limits as symptomatically human. To take seriously one's opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate the social world in which one comes to be human in the first place and which remains precisely that which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Judith|date=2001|title=Giving an Account of Oneself|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1566427|journal=Diacritics|volume=31|issue=4|pages=22–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fordhampress.com/9780823225040/giving-an-account-of-oneself/|title=Giving an Account of Oneself|work=Fordham University Press|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was particularly the case in France during the anti-gay marriage protests. [[Bruno Perreau]] has shown that Butler was literally depicted as an "antichrist", both because of her gender and her Jewish identity, the fear of minority politics and critical studies being expressed through fantasies of a corrupted body.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Perreau, Queer Theory: The French Response, Stanford University Press, 2016, p. 58-59 and 75-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some academics and political activists maintain that Butler's radical departure from the sex/gender dichotomy and her non-essentialist conception of gender—along with her insistence that power helps form the subject—revolutionized feminist and queer praxis, thought, and studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rottenberg|first=Catherine|title=Judith Butler|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=5173|publisher=The Literary Encyclopedia|accessdate=9 October 2013|date=27 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darin Barney of [[McGill University]] writes that:
{{quote|Butler's work on gender, sex, sexuality, queerness, feminism, bodies, political speech and ethics has changed the way scholars all over the world think, talk and write about identity, subjectivity, power and politics. It has also changed the lives of countless people whose bodies, genders, sexualities and desires have made them subject to violence, exclusion and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barney|first=Darin|title=In Defense of Judith Butler|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/darin-barney/in-defense-of-judith-butler-mcgill_b_3346589.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Others scholars have been more critical. In 1998, [[Denis Dutton]]'s journal ''Philosophy and Literature'' awarded Butler first prize in its fourth annual "Bad Writing Competition", which set out to "celebrate bad writing from the most stylistically lamentable passages found in scholarly books and articles."&lt;ref name="bad"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://denisdutton.com/bad_writing.htm| first=Denis| last=Dutton| authorlink=Denis Dutton| year=1998| title=Bad Writing Contest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her unwitting entry, which ran in a 1997 issue of the scholarly journal ''[[Diacritics]]'', ran thus:
{{quote|The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power.&lt;ref name="bad" /&gt;}}

Some critics have accused Butler of elitism due to her difficult prose style, while others claim that she reduces gender to "discourse" or promotes a form of gender voluntarism. [[Susan Bordo]], for example, has argued that Butler reduces gender to language and has contended that the body is a major part of gender, in opposition to Butler's conception of gender as performance.&lt;ref&gt;Hekman, Susan (1998). "Material Bodies." ''Body and Flesh: a Philosophical Reader'' ed. by Donn Welton. Blackwell Publishing. pp. 61–70.&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly vocal critic has been liberal feminist [[Martha Nussbaum]], who has argued that Butler misreads [[J.&amp;nbsp;L. Austin]]'s idea of performative utterance, makes erroneous legal claims, forecloses an essential site of resistance by repudiating pre-cultural agency, and provides no normative ethical theory to direct the subversive performances that Butler endorses.&lt;ref name="The Professor Parody"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nussbaum |first=Martha |date=February 22, 1999 |title=The Professor of Parody |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/150687/professor-parody |work=The New Republic |location= |access-date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803112258/http://www.akad.se/Nussbaum.pdf |archive-date=August 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Nancy Fraser]]'s critique of Butler was part of a famous exchange between the two theorists.  Fraser has suggested that Butler's focus on performativity distances her from "everyday ways of talking and thinking about ourselves. ... Why should we use such a self-distancing idiom?"&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Nancy (1995). "False Antitheses." In Seyla Benhabib, Judith Butler, Drucilla Cornell and Nancy Fraser (eds.), ''Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange''. Routledge. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Undoing Theory: The "Transgender Question" and the Epistemic Violence of Anglo-American Feminist Theory."  Hypatia 24 (3):pp. 11-32.&lt;/ref&gt;—have criticised Judith Butler's ''Undoing Gender'' for under-emphasizing the intersectional aspects of gender-based violence. For example, Timothy Laurie notes that Butler's use of phrases like "gender politics" and "gender violence" in relation to assaults on transgender individuals in the United States can "[scour] a landscape filled with class and labour relations, racialised urban stratification, and complex interactions between sexual identity, sexual practices and sex work", and produce instead "a clean surface on which struggles over 'the human' are imagined to play out".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= The Ethics of Nobody I Know: Gender and the Politics of Description | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Qualitative Research Journal | volume= 14 | issue= 1 | page= 72 | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/6262250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, both Namaste and Laurie acknowledge the enduring importance of Butler's critical contributions to the study of gender identities.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

German feminist [[Alice Schwarzer]] speaks of Butler's "radical intellectual games" that would not change how society classifies and treats a woman; thus, by eliminating female and male identity Butler would have abolished the discourse about sexism in the queer community. Schwarzer also accuses Butler of remaining silent about the oppression of women and homosexuals in the Islamic world, while readily exercising her right to [[Same-sex marriage|same-sex-marriage]] in the United States; instead, Butler would sweepingly defend [[Islam]], including [[Islamism]], from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aliceschwarzer.de/artikel/eine-antwort-auf-butler-334719|title=Weiberzank - oder politische Kontroverse?  {{!}} ALICE SCHWARZER|website=Alice Schwarzer|language=de|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activism==
Much of Butler's early political activism centered around queer and feminist issues, and she served, for a period of time, as the chair of the board of the [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission]].  Over the years, she has been particularly active in the gay and lesbian rights, feminist, and anti-war movements.&lt;ref name="mcgill" /&gt; She has also written and spoken out on issues ranging from affirmative action and gay marriage to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the prisoners detained at Guantanamo Bay.  More recently, she has been active in the [[Occupy movement]] and has publicly expressed support for a version of the 2005 BDS ([[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]]) campaign against Israel.

On September 7, 2006, Butler participated in a faculty-organized [[teach-in]] against the [[2006 Lebanon War]] at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Coming attractions for fall 2006| url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/09/06_eventspreview2.shtml|publisher=UC Berkeley| accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another widely publicized moment occurred in June 2010, when Butler refused the Civil Courage Award (Zivilcouragepreis) of the [[Christopher Street Day]] (CSD) Parade in Berlin, Germany at the award ceremony. She cited racist comments on the part of organizers and a general failure of CSD organizations to distance themselves from racism in general and from anti-Muslim excuses for war more specifically. Criticizing the event's commercialism, she went on to name several groups that she commended as stronger opponents of "homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism, and militarism".&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV9dd6r361k I must distance myself from this complicity with racism (Video)]  Christopher Street Day 'Civil Courage Prize' Day Refusal Speech. June 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, Butler attended [[Occupy Wall Street]] and, in reference to calls for clarification of the protesters' demands, she said: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;People have asked, so what are the demands? What are the demands all of these people are making? Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social equality and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible&amp;nbsp;– that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, we demand the impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/10/24/judith_butler_at_occupy_wall_street/|title=Judith Butler at Occupy Wall Street|date=October 24, 2011|website=Salon.com|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adorno Prize affair===
When Butler received the 2012 [[Theodor W. Adorno Award|Adorno Prize]], the prize committee came under attack from Israel's Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center office in Jerusalem, [[Efraim Zuroff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=282921|title=Diaspora - Jewish people world news - The Jerusalem Post|website=Jpost.com|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the German Central Council of Jews. They were upset at Butler's selection because of her remarks about Israel and specifically her "calls for a boycott against Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4274289,00.html|title=German Jews oppose award for US philosopher|date=August 29, 2012|website=Ynetnews.com|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler responded saying that "she did not take attacks from German Jewish leaders personally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/frankfurt-ripped-for-honoring-jewish-american-scholar-who-backs-israel-boycott-1.463424|title=Frankfurt Ripped for Honoring Jewish-American Scholar Who Backs Israel Boycott|date=September 7, 2012|website=Haaretz.com|accessdate=December 4, 2017|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, she wrote, the attacks are "directed against everyone who is critical against Israel and its current policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=JTA|title=Frankfurt ripped for honoring Jewish-American scholar who backs Israel boycott|journal=Haaretz|date=7 September 2012|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/frankfurt-ripped-for-honoring-jewish-american-scholar-who-backs-israel-boycott-1.463424|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the ''[[Mondoweiss]]'' website, Butler asserted that she developed strong ethical views on the basis of Jewish philosophical thought and that it is "blatantly untrue, absurd, and painful for anyone to argue that those who formulate a criticism of the State of Israel is anti-Semitic or, if Jewish, self-hating".&lt;ref name=mondoweiss&gt;{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Judith Butler responds to attack: 'I affirm a Judaism that is not associated with state violence'|url=http://mondoweiss.net/2012/08/judith-butler-responds-to-attack-i-affirm-a-judaism-that-is-not-associated-with-state-violence.html|publisher=Mondoweiss|accessdate=9 October 2013|date=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comments on Hamas and Hezbollah ===

Butler was criticized for statements she had made about [[Hamas]] and [[Hezbollah]].  She had described them as "social movements that are progressive, that are on the Left, that are part of a global Left".&lt;ref&gt;Petra Marquardt-Bigman, [http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/09/07/defending-judith-butler-in-the-ivory-tower/ "Defending Judith Butler in The Ivory Tower"], ''The Algemeiner Journal'', September 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She was accused of defending "Hezbollah and Hamas as progressive organizations" and supporting their tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinthal|first=Benjamin|title=Frankfurt to award US advocate of Israel boycott|journal=The Jerusalem Post|date=26 August 2012|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Frankfurt-to-award-US-advocate-of-Israel-boycott|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Illouz|first=Eva|title=Judith Butler gets a taste of her own politics|journal=Haaretz|date=20 September 2012|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/judith-butler-gets-a-taste-of-her-own-politics-1.465861|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler responded to these criticisms by stating that her remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah were taken completely out of context and, in so doing, her established views on non-violence were contradicted and misrepresented.

Butler describes the origin of her remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah in the following way: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was asked by a member of an academic audience a few years ago whether I thought Hamas and Hezbollah belonged to "the global left" and I replied with two points. My first point was merely descriptive: those political organizations define themselves as anti-imperialist, and anti-imperialism is one characteristic of the global left, so on that basis one could describe them as part of the global left. My second point was then critical: as with any group on the left, one has to decide whether one is for that group or against that group, and one needs to critically evaluate their stand.&lt;ref name="mondoweiss" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Comments on Black Lives Matter ===
{{Expand section|date=October 2017}}

In a January 2015 interview with [[George Yancy]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', Butler discussed the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement. The dialogue draws heavily on her 2004 book ''Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yancy|first1=George|last2=Butler|first2=Judith|title=What's Wrong With 'All Lives Matter'?|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/whats-wrong-with-all-lives-matter/?_r=0|accessdate=7 March 2015|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|date=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MLA presidency and the Avital Ronell sexual harassment case==
On May 11, 2018, Butler led a group of scholars in writing a letter to [[New York University]] following the sexual harassment suit filed by a former NYU graduate student against his advisor [[Avital Ronell]]. The signatories acknowledged not having had access to the confidential findings of the investigation that followed the [[Title IX]] complaint against Ronell. Nonetheless, they accused the complainant of waging a "malicious campaign" against Ronell. The signatories also wrote that the presumed "malicious intention has animated and sustained this legal nightmare" for a highly regarded scholar. "If she were to be terminated or relieved of her duties, the injustice would be widely recognized and opposed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Battle-Over-Alleged-Harassment/244295|title=Battle Over Alleged Harassment Escalates as Former Graduate Student Sues Professor and NYU|date=August 16, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler, the chief signatory, invoked her title as President Elect of the [[Modern Language Association]]. James J. Marino, a professor at Cleveland State University and a member of the MLA, started a petition to demand Butler's resignation or removal from her post. He argued that "Protesting against one instance of punishment is only a means to the larger end of preserving senior faculty's privilege of impunity. ... [Butler] was standing up for an old, corrupt, and long-standing way of doing business. The time for doing business that way is over. We should never look back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/08/20/some-say-particulars-ronell-harassment-case-are-moot-it-all-comes-down-power|title=Some say the particulars of the Ronell harassment case are moot, in that it all comes down to power|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some three months later, Butler apologized to the MLA for the letter. "I acknowledged that I should not have allowed the MLA affiliation to go forward with my name," she wrote to the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]''. "I expressed regret to the MLA officers and staff, and my colleagues accepted my apology. I extend that same apology to MLA members."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/letters/judith-butler-explains-letter-in-support-of-avital-ronell/|title=Judith Butler Explains Letter in Support of Avital Ronell – Letters - Blogs - The Chronicle of Higher Education|website=www.chronicle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
All of Butler's books have been translated into numerous languages; ''Gender Trouble'', alone, has been translated into twenty-seven different languages. In addition, she has co-authored and edited over a dozen volumes—the most recent of which is ''Dispossession: The Performative in the Political'' (2013), coauthored with Athena Athanasiou. Over the years she has also published many influential essays, interviews, and public presentations. Butler is considered by many as "one of the most influential voices in contemporary political theory,"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Barker | first = Derek W.M. | contribution = Judith Butler's postmodern antigone | editor-last = Barker | editor-first = Derek W.M. | title = Tragedy and citizenship conflict, reconciliation, and democracy from Haemon to Hegel | page = 119 | publisher = [[SUNY Press|State University of New York Press]] | location = Albany | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780791477403 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as the most widely read and influential gender theorist in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ian|first=Buchanan|title=A Dictionary of Critical Theory|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191726590|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199532919.001.0001/acref-9780199532919-e-100|authorlink=Judith Butler|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LIPIA''' ({{lang-ar-at|معهد العلوم الإسلامية والعربية في إندونيسيا |Ma'had al-ʻulumi al-Islamiyyah wal 'arabiyah fi Indunisia}}; {{lang-id|Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Islam dan Bahasa Arab}}; {{lang-en|Islamic and Arabic College of Indonesia}}) is an educational institution established in Jakarta.  The college is a branch of the [[Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University]] in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. The main purpose is to teach [[Arabic]] and [[Islam]]. The college also teaches [[Wahhabi]] [[Madhab]], a branch of [[Salafi]].

==History==
The College was founded in 1980 to provide education with concentrations in Arabic and Islamic religion for Indonesian students with approval from the Royal Court, No. 5/n/26710.  The name of the college was ''Arabic Teaching Institute'' ("Lembaga Pendidikan Bahasa Arab") until 1986. The college gives scholarship to its top students to continue their education to [[Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University]] in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]].  The most well known organizations that serve as primary conduits of Saudi funding in Indonesia are the ''Dewan Dakwah Islamiyah Indonesia'' (the Indonesian Society for the Propagation of Islam, or DDII) and LIPIA.&lt;ref name="mehden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mei.edu/content/map/saudi-religious-influence-indonesia|title=Saudi Religious Influence in Indonesia|first=Fred R. |last=von der Mehden|date=December 1, 2014|access-date=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the vision of the LIPIA establishment is to be the distinguished leader in creative learning, teaching and research in Islamic and Arabic sciences, it has also became a channel for Saudi government to spread its ideology. The [[salafi]] movement in early 1990s in Indonesia began to develop on university campuses, but mostly gained impetus with the arrival of other Middle-eastern educated and [[Soviet-Afghan War]] veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; LIPIA not only helps Saudi Arabia to influence Indonesian society, it also provides a gateway to all of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="giga"/&gt;

All lectures taught in LIPIA are delivered in [[Arabic language]] and about 80–90 percent of the lecturers are from Saudi Arabia. It has very high acceptance standard, where only 200 students are accepted out of 2000 applicants. Once they are admitted, they do not need to pay any tuition, even they are paid stipends.  200 students graduate from the college every year.&lt;ref name="Jejak Kafilah"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q2a2w8DsNakC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=LIPIA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-ietU4X7KIKnyAS3g4CgCQ&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=LIPIA&amp;f=false| pages=94–101| language=id | title=Jejak Kafilah: Pengaruh Radikalisme Timur Tengah di Indonesia| first1=Anthony |last1=Bubalo |first2=Greg| last2=Fealy| publisher=Mizan Pustaka| year=2007| isbn=978-9-79433-476-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college teaches [[Wahhabi]] [[Madhab]], a branch of [[Salafi]].&lt;ref name="mehden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kinzer|first1=Stephen|authorlink1=Stephen Kinzer|title=Saudi Arabia is destabilizing the world|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2017/06/10/saudi-arabia-destabilizing-world/ivMeb7TWGk1fQaVjZWWKGP/story.html?p1=Article_Trending_Most_Viewed|accessdate=14 June 2017|work=Boston Globe|date=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every student has to learn the teachings of [[Ibn Taimiyah]]. The college was also influenced by [[Al-Ikhwan al-Muslimin]],&lt;ref name="Jejak Kafilah" /&gt;  and some of its lecturers were influenced by the [[Muslim brotherhood]] doctrine.  Many of the [[alumni]] later became Salafi activists, preachers or teachers. Some of the alumni then open other institutions based on Wahhabism and funded by Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ulil Abshar Abdalla]] noted that LIPIA's Wahhabism curriculum predisposes its graduates to adopt an attitude hostile to the local Indonesian culture and Muslim practices.&lt;ref name="kumar"/&gt; Top male students, who are willing to learn the Koran by heart and can be expected to propagate Saudi ideas in Southeast Asia, are given grants for the Imam Muhammad bin Saud University in Riyadh. Their stay in Riyadh is intended to make them more committed to Wahhabi values and more sympathetic to Saudi rule.&lt;ref name="giga"/&gt;

Some figures who have studied at LIPIA are [[Jafar Umar Thalib]], Yazid bin Abdul Qadir Jawas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.muslimedianews.com/2014/08/penyebaran-salafi-jihadi-di-indonesia.html|title=Penyebaran Salafi Jihadi di Indonesia (Salafi Haroki hingga Ikhwan Quthbiyah)|language=id|work=MuslimMedia News|date=August 4, 2014|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad Rizieq Shihab]], and [[Ulil Abshar Abdalla]].&lt;ref name="kumar"/&gt;

==Program==
The program is in the format of courses that include learning the [[Quran]] and Arabic language free of charge to people who are interested in participating. The program is held on Saturday and Sunday on a weekly basis. The classes are held for two Semester (24-week or 192 hours) which are adjusted to LIPIA school calendar.&lt;ref name="kursuslipia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kursuslipia.com/p/profil.html|title=LIPIA: Profile|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessons in Jakarta transfer deeply rooted discourses from Saudi Arabia to Indonesia, with teachers required to impart the superiority of the [[Hanbali]] School of Law.&lt;ref name="giga"/&gt;

Participants who have passed the final exam will be given a certificate of LIPIA at the end of the course activities.&lt;ref name="kursuslipia"/&gt;  Everyday life on campus is permeated by commandments and prohibitions intended to shape the students according to the Saudi model: Wearing jeans, loud laughter, listening to music, and watching television are all prohibited. In contrast, the common dress style for Salafi men - ankle-length linen pants, sandals, goatees and the use of [[Teeth cleaning twig|neem stick]]s - are all encouraged. Women are expected to veil themselves completely.&lt;ref name="giga"/&gt;

'''Maria Osipovna (Iosifovna) Knebel''' ({{lang-ru|Мари́я О́сиповна (Ио́сифовна) Кне́бель}}; {{OldStyleDate|31 May|1898|19 May}}{{spaced ndash}}1 June 1985)&lt;ref name=dates&gt;For dates before the Soviet state's switch from the [[Julian calendar]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]] in February 1918, this article gives the date in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] (Gregorian) date-format first, followed by the same day in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] (Julian) date-format (which appears in square brackets and slightly smaller); this is to facilitate comparison between primary and secondary sources. The difference between the two is 12 days for Julian dates prior to 1 March 1900 [Gregorian 14 March] and 13 days for Julian dates on or after 1 March 1900. Thus, Knebel was born on the 31 May according to the Gregorian calendar that is in use today, while her birthday was 19 May according to the Julian calendar that was in use at the time. For more information on the difference between the two systems, see the article [[Old Style and New Style dates]]. Dates after 1 February 1918 are presented as normal.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Russian [[theatre practitioner]].&lt;ref&gt;Carnicke (2010, 99, 101) and Golub (1998, 603).&lt;/ref&gt; Having trained with [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]], and [[Michael Chekhov]], her work integrated the approaches and emphases of all three, with a particular focus on Stanislavski's technique of "active analysis" in the rehearsal of plays.&lt;ref name=c99&gt;Carnicke (2010, 99).&lt;/ref&gt; She worked as a [[character actor]], a [[theatre director]], and a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Carnicke (2010, 99, 102) and Golub (1998, 603).&lt;/ref&gt; Her students included the actor [[Oleg Yefremov]], the playwright Victor Rozov, and the directors [[Anatoly Vasiliev]] and Adolf Shapiro.&lt;ref&gt;Carnicke (2010, 99—100).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, she was named a [[People’s Artist of the RSFSR|People's Artist of the RSFSR]].&lt;ref&gt;Golub (1998, 603).&lt;/ref&gt;

Her roles as an actor included Charlotta in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'', the madwoman in [[Alexander Ostrovsky]]'s ''[[The Storm (Ostrovsky)|The Storm]]'', and Sniffles in [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s ''[[The Blue Bird (play)|The Blue Bird]]'' at the [[Moscow Art Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Carnicke (2010, 100, 102).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, she directed a production of Chekhov's ''The Cherry Orchard'' at the [[Abbey Theatre]] in [[Dublin]].

'''Pietro Alagona''' (1549 – 19 October 1624) was a [[Catholic]] [[theologian]]. 

Alagona was born in [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. He entered the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1564, taught [[philosophy]] and theology, and was Rector of Trapani. He died in [[Rome]].

His first works were published under the family name of his mother, Givarra. Later on he used his own name, Alagona, and is best known for his Compendium of the works of [[Martin Aspilcueta]], who was a doctor of theology in [[Navarre]]. This Martin Aspilcueta was the uncle of [[St. Francis Xavier]]. The ''Enchiridion, seu Manuale Confessariorum'', which was compiled by Alagona, went through at least twenty-three editions. A translation of it into French by Legard, was condemned by the Parliament of [[Rouen]], 12 February 1762. He also published a compendium of the "Summa", which ran through twenty-five editions, and a compendium of the whole of Canon Law in two volumes, quarto. In the Jesuit College of [[Palermo]] there is also found a treatise by Alagona on [[Logic]] and [[Physics]].

'''''Playboy: The Mansion''''' is a [[simulation game|simulation]] [[video game]] for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] consoles, developed by [[Cyberlore Studios]], published by [[Groove Games]] and [[Arush Entertainment]] and licensed by [[Playboy Enterprises]].

==Gameplay==

''Playboy: The Mansion'' puts players in the role of [[Hugh Hefner]], the founder of ''[[Playboy]]'' Magazine and [[Playboy Enterprises]], referred to in the game as 'Hef'. The aim of the game is to build the famed Playboy Empire from scratch, starting from a humble magazine to celebrity endorsements to home entertainment to Internet websites to merchandise.

The player can mold the famed [[Playboy Mansion]] to their own needs and wants, and has the option of experiencing the infamous ''Playboy'' [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]] parties in locations such as the Grotto and the Clubhouse. Hef, as well as all other characters in the game, can build three types of relationships with other characters: casual, business, and romantic.  Each month, the player has to print an issue of the magazine.  To do that the player needs a cover shoot, a centerfold, an essay from a celebrity, interview with a celebrity, a pictorial about a subject and an article about a subject.  The player must hire photographers and writers to create each issue.  All the characters have interests, such as sports and music, and writers on those topics will produce higher-quality articles. In the game, the player is the photographer during photo shoots. The game contains many sexual references, including sexual relationships.

There are twelve missions in total. Some of the goals include making and/or fixing relationships with people, publishing certain magazine content, and throwing parties. Players can also choose not to achieve goals, as there is no time limit, and do other things such as parties, mansion renovations and playing with the mansion's variety of games; however, magazines must continue to be published as that is the player's income source.

==Music==

A soundtrack to the game, mixed by [[United States|American]] [[Disc Jockey|DJ]] and [[record producer]] [[Felix da Housecat]] has been released. It features house tracks by many renowned producers like [[Armand Van Helden]], [[DJ Sneak]] or [[Kaskade]].

==Expansion pack==
''Playboy: The Mansion -  Private Party Expansion Pack'' is the expansion pack. It adds extra features such as parties like [[Playboy Mansion#Midsummer Night's Dream Party|Midsummer Night's Dream]], world-famous celebrities and [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]]s, new animations, enhanced character editing and party-themed music.

===Features===
The expansion adds many new features to the game. When characters engage in sexual activities, they now remove their underwear and their [[Sex organ#Genitals|genitals]] are blurred, much like ''[[The Sims]]'' characters. Another feature is the ability to throw "theme parties", which consist of Halloween, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Hef's Birthday, Tropical, Playmate of the Year and more.

The game was met with mixed reception.  [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]] gave it a score of 60% and 59 out of 100 for the PC version,&lt;ref name=GRPC/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCPC/&gt; 59.97% and 59 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version,&lt;ref name=GRPS2/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCPS2/&gt; and 62.14% and 61 out of 100 for the Xbox version.&lt;ref name=GRXB/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCXB/&gt;

[[Eurogamer]] noted that the game was similar to ''The Sims'' series but was unfortunately less entertaining.  It was considered "a little too slight a proposition for a full game."&lt;ref name=EuroG/&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' gave it a mixed review and stated, "Sex and nudity often work well in movies, but video games laced with sex never rise above mediocrity, and ''Mansion'' seems decidedly underbaked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/17/technology/circuits/17game.html?ex=1109307600&amp;en=c4214af930777332&amp;ei=5070&amp;_r=0|title=Underneath It All, Substance Sells|last=Herold|first=Charles|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=2005-02-17|accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five and called it "A frisky concept with limited thrills and not enough depth to challenge gamers."&lt;ref name=Sydney&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Games/Playtime-cut-short/2005/03/23/1111525214598.html|title=Playtime cut short|last=Wilcox|first=Mike|publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''|date=2005-03-25|accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' gave it two stars out of four and stated, "I flipped on the game expecting a world of champagne, roses and frequent wisps of steam.

PBIS uses evidence and data-based programs, practices and strategies to frame behavioral improvement in terms of student growth in academic performance, safety, behavior, and establishing and maintaining positive school culture. PBIS addresses the needs of at-risk students as well as the multi-leveled needs of all students in regards to behavior, which creates an environment for both teaching and learning to occur in schools. In contrast to PBIS, many schools used exclusionary discipline practices including detentions, [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]], or [[expulsion (education)|expulsions]] to separate students from the classroom and from peers.  PBIS emphasizes preventing problem behaviors before they happen to increase the opportunity for students to learn by keeping them in the classroom. PBIS is a team-based framework for schools that borrows elements from [[response to intervention]], an intervention that uses diagnostic data to develop personalized learning plans for all students.

==Background==
PBIS is an acronym for Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports.&lt;ref&gt;Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI) (n.d.). [http://rti.dpi.wi.gov/rti_pbis "Positive behavioral intervention and supports (PBIS)"].  Retrieved March 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective classroom management and discipline are essential for teaching and learning. PBIS emphasizes the integrated use of classroom management and school-wide discipline strategies coupled with effective academic instruction to create a positive and safe school climate for all students.  PBIS is based in a behaviorist psychology approach to improving student behavior, which means that teachers and students identify misbehavior, model appropriate behaviors, and provide clear consequences for behavior in the classroom context.  In a PBIS model, schools must define, teach, and reinforce appropriate behaviors to ensure success. Research shows that punishing students inconsistently without a positive alternative, is ineffective and only offers short-term solutions.&lt;ref name=pbis&gt;Bradley, Renee (2015). [https://www.pbis.org "Positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS)"]. ''U.S. Department of Education (OSEP Technical Assistance Center)''. Retrieved March 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Modeling and rewarding positive behaviors are more effective. The goal of PBIS is to establish a positive school climate. To do this, a continuum of behavior support has been established which can be applied at the school level (primary level), for small groups of students (secondary level), and for individual level (tertiary level).&lt;ref name=pbis/&gt;

==Core features==
PBIS is not a packaged program for districts to purchase. Instead, it is a framework approach that helps schools to identify the key tasks in developing preventative positive behavior tailored to their own school.  It is an approach defined by the following core design components.

===Outcomes===
The outcome is the goal for improved student behavior towards which the school community aims.  The goals must be measurable, and must clearly be the result of implementing the PBIS model.&lt;ref name=Services&gt;Student Services (2015). [http://www.sjusd.org/student-services/pbis/what-is-pbis/ "Positive behavior interventions &amp; supports (PBIS): What is PBIS?"] Retrieved March 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Outcomes of a successful PBIS framework with a school can be measured in both behavior data and academic achievement of the students in the school. The academic and behavior goals are often defined and supported by the students, families, and teachers in tandem for the program to succeed.&lt;ref name=pbis/&gt;

===Data===
PBIS is grounded in the data being used for all levels of decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Renee (2015). [https://www.pbis.org/school "Positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS)"]. ''U.S. Department of Education (OSEP Technical Assistance Center)''. Retrieved March 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  The team often considers trends in numbers, locations of where problems occurred, which classes they occurred in, and individual students that were involved.  Through the data, schools take stock of their current situation, pinpoint areas for change and or improvement, and evaluate the effects of current and future interventions.

===Practices===
This component refers to the evidence-based curriculum, instruction, interventions, and strategies implemented within the school, and are meant to create a common and shared understanding of expectations.  These practices are introduced through the team after a review of the data.&lt;ref name=Services/&gt;

===Systems===
PBIS requires a review team of educators with buy-in from across the school and strong administrative support to design and enforce the PBIS system.  The team is generally a representative group of all of the staff (classroom teachers, special education teachers, specialists, etc.).  In a secondary school, students could also be included as part of this team.  The team creates the systems used by the remainder of the staff and the students they serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Colvin, G.|author2=Fernandez, E.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Sustaining effective behavior support systems in an elementary school|journal=Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions|volume=2|issue=4|pages=251–253|doi=10.1177/109830070000200414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuum of support==
Each PBIS model uses a continuum of support.  Tiers of support that range in intestate are offered to students as their needs fluctuate.  Most students are supported by tier 1 (universal) Level of support, which describes the general school context.  As students struggle with the behavioral expectations of the model, they may advance to higher tiers to provide more support.

===Tier 1: Primary Level ''(support for all)''===
The first level in PBIS is the universal level. In terms of PBIS, this refers to the school-wide expectations that are defined and taught to all school staff in each of the settings within the school. These expectations are developed by the team and taught to students by their regular classroom teachers, administrators or others who have contact with all students. Many schools who have adopted this framework use: Be Safe, Be Respectful, Be Responsible, but like all aspects, this is determined by the school.  The fidelity of the expectations should be determined by the continuous collecting of data.&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, R., Panyan, M., Smith, C. &amp; Wessendorf, S. (in press) Systems change with school-wide positive behavior supports: Iowa’s work in progress. Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the expectations, there should be a system of acknowledgement and reinforcement of expected behaviors.

The Core Principles of PBIS at the primary level are:
#schools can effectively teach appropriate behavior to all students 
#intervene early 
#use a multi-tier model 
#use research-based interventions 
#monitor student progress often 
#use data to make decisions
#use assessments to screen, diagnose, and monitor progress
These principles make the PBIS program significant in that it makes it more proactive rather than reactive. Furthermore, PBIS helps schools develop a common language, common practices, and consistent application of positive and negative reinforcement at a school-wide level.&lt;ref name=pbis/&gt;

===Tier 2: Secondary Level ''(support for some)''===
Although the primary level is taught and reinforced with all students, there may be some students who need additional intervention for students with at-risk behaviors as determined by the data. Secondary prevention provides intensive or targeted interventions to support students not responding to the primary efforts.  These behavioral interventions are taught by specialized staff like special educators, school psychologists, behavior interventionists, and counselors.  Some examples of tier 2 behavior interventions are targeted social skill groups, behavior plans with continuous progress monitoring.

===Tier 3: Tertiary Level ''(support for few)''===
PBIS also acknowledges that some students have high risk behaviors and need specialized, or individualized skill building practice due to exhibited habits of problem behavior.  Tier 3 behavioral interventions involve a functional behavioral assessment (FBA) and an individualized plan of support which includes: 
#new skills to replace problem behaviors 
#reorganization of current environment or "triggers" 
#procedures for monitoring, evaluating, and reassessing the plan. 
To succeed in a tier 3 intervention, both tier 1 and tier 2 interventions must also be in place. Also, support must be conducted in a comprehensive and collaborative manner.

The Tier 3 process should include the student with the behavior issue and the people who know them the best on a personal level working together as a behavioral support team (BST). Support should be tailored to the student’s specific needs. It should also include multiple interventions. The goal at this level is to diminish problematic behavior, increase adaptive skills, and attempt to increase the student’s quality of life.&lt;ref name=pbis/&gt;

==Alternatives to PBIS==

===Culturally responsive PBIS===
Culturally responsive PBIS (CR-PBIS) is also a framework aimed at restructuring school culture much like PBIS. However, CR-PBIS emphasizes change through understanding and interacting with the community. Providing an environment in which all cultures are acknowledged, respected, and celebrated is important in building the bridge between home culture and school culture. To ensure all students succeed, an understanding of their various cultural beliefs and practices are a must. When someone engages in culturally responsive practice, they are forming an understanding about the values, beliefs, and behaviors of other people than themselves.

Race has been a predictor of success in schools for decades. Students of color have statistically lower rates of success. Part of the job of educators is to help bridge the social understanding gap in order to bridge the educational understanding gap.&lt;ref&gt;Wisconsin PBIS Network (2015) [http://www.wisconsinrticenter.org/educators/understanding-rti-a-systems-view/crp.html "Culturally Responsive Practices"]. Retrieved April 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, there is some concern that PBIS alone 
creates outcome disparities due to culture.  The behavior of students with color, without the 
knowledge of the community they come from, may be seen as disruptive, resistant, and limiting 
to student success. CR-PBIS tries to address these concerns that are left untouched by the 
traditional PBIS framework by including families as a large piece of creating an environment for teaching and learning.

===Responsive Classroom===
Just like PBIS, Responsive Classroom (RC) centers on research-based approaches and strive to ensure high quality education to all students.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Responsive Classroom (n.d.). [http://www.responsiveclassroom.org/sites/default/files/pdf_files/RC_PBIS_white_paper.pdf "Responsive classroom and PBIS: Can schools use them together?"]  Retrieved March 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Both agree that these positive behaviors and the skills needed to reach them must be explicitly taught to students. Lastly, both also believe that non-punitive strategies are more effective than what has been used in schools in the past.

Where PBIS is a framework that coaches the school staff to create their own resources and changes, RC outlines specific prescribed practices that schools should use to reach this goal. Responsive Classroom is a for-purchase-program that staff can be trained in at multiple levels and has published tools and strategies for meeting these goals with students.

'''Pyongyang University of Science and Technology''' ('''PUST''') is [[North Korea]]'s first privately funded university. It is founded, operated, and partly funded by associations and people outside the country. PUST was jointly planned and constructed by forces from both [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], along with contributions from groups and individuals{{cn|date=December 2014}} from other nations, in particular [[China]] and the [[United States]]. The initiative is largely funded by [[Evangelical Christian]] movements. Originally scheduled for launch in 2003, the project was delayed for several years and began operations in October 2010.

==History==
The university is in the countryside outside of [[Pyongyang]] in a separate but close administrative region with permission required for access to Pyongyang. After introductory negotiations, the PUST project was started in 2001, on the initiative of Professor [[Kim Chin Kyung]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/31/news/31iht-a4_34.html?pagewanted=1 "South Korean, Once Held as Spy, Plans a University in Pyongyang"] New York Times July 31, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bill Powell, [http://money.cnn.com/2009/09/14/magazines/fortune/pyongyang_university_north_korea.fortune/index.htm "The capitalist who loves North Korea"], Money CNN, September 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bill Powell, [http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/14/news/international/james_kim_pust.fortune/index.htm The capitalist who (still) loves North Korea], Money CNN,  March 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed in a personal meeting with former North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-il|Kim Jong-Il]]. Professor Kim's earlier accomplishments include being founding president of [[Yanbian University of Science and Technology]] (YUST) in northeastern China, but inside the [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture]], founded in 1992. The PUST will cooperate with YUST and draw on their experiences.

With exception of foreign language courses, all teaching is conducted in English. Almost all faculty work as volunteers and come from a Christian background,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reuters|title=Private North Korean University Seeks Texas A&amp;M Academic Help|date=2017-01-30|journal=Newsweek|url=http://www.newsweek.com/north-korea-north-korea-private-university-christian-universities-food-550321|accessdate=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the president saying:
:"While the skills to be taught are technical in nature, the spirit underlying this historic venture is unabashedly Christian...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pust.kr/ "President's Welcome"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509052452/http://pust.kr/ |date=2013-05-09 }}, pust.kr&lt;/ref&gt;

The PUST construction plans were politically troubled and slowed down in 2005 and 2006, in connection with the [[2006 North Korean nuclear test]], but later on resumed and have led to their conclusion. PUST classes began in the fall of October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Richard. [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6063/1624.short "Crunch Time for North Korea’s Revolutionary New University"], ''Science Magazine'', December 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It had its official opening in September 2010 and planned to enroll up to 200 higher-level students per year, from both parts of Korea. Plans include the hiring of up to 250 faculty members from universities and research institutions in South Korea, China, the United States, and other countries. As a joint venture university, the PUST is seen as a contribution to the [[Korean reunification]] process.

Kim Hak Song, who managed a farm run by the agriculture department of the university, was detained on charges of committing “hostile criminal acts” against the country on 6 May 2017. Kim Sang-duk, who also worked for the university, had been arrested on similar charges on April 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/pyongyang-university-science-technology-2-u-s-employees-detained-n756176 |title=Pyongyang University of Science and Technology: 2 U.S. Employees Detained|website=NBC News |date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; They both were released on May 8, 2018, into U.S. Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]]'s custody after overtures were made for a meeting to be held between President [[Donald Trump]] and Supreme Leader [[Kim Jong-un]] in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/world/asia/north-korea-american-prisoners.html Who are the 3 American Detainees Freed by North Korea?], ''[[New York Times]]'', Russell Goldman, May 9, 2018. Retrieved June 18, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a ban on Americans traveling to North Korea issued by the U.S. State Department in mid-July in 2017, the university had to start the fall semester without its dozens of American staffers in September, roughly 60 out of 130 foreigners in the university, including faculty members, staffers and family members, as none of them received special permission to stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/09/02/asia-pacific/pyongyang-university-start-classes-without-american-staff-due-travel-ban/#.WbQBOMJB3YU |title=Pyongyang university to start classes without American staff due to travel ban | website =Japan Times|date=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects==
The goal of PUST is to contribute to North Korean economic development by producing professionals and leaders in technical disciplines, who are fluent in English and another foreign language (such as Chinese or German), and who are accustomed to working in an international setting. [[Bachelor of Science]] and [[Ph.D.|doctorate]] degrees will be awarded in [[Electrical and Computer Engineering]] (ECE), [[Agriculture]] and [[Life Sciences]] (ALS), and [[International Finance]] and [[Management]] (IFM). The university has plans to open schools in Public Healthcare and Construction Engineering as early as 2013.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Mark.

Graduate students and professors have internet access, but it is filtered and monitored.&lt;ref name="yout_Comp"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Computer Science in the DPRK [31c3]| author = Will Scott| website = [[YouTube]]| publisher = [[Chaos Computer Club]]| date = 29 December 2014| accessdate = 23 February 2015| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuxlLLeKZZ8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3051">The '''Society of Gilders''' (SoG) is an international [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to the practice and preservation of the art of using [[gold]] and [[metal leaf]]. SoG offers technical help for gilders, restorers, conservators, craftsmen, and all those interested in the [[gilding]] arts. Classes and conferences held by SoG bring gilders together from around the globe to learn, discuss and share.

Membership is open to any interested individual, institution or corporation.

==Mission==
The Society of Gilders is a non-profit [[educational organization]] devoted to the art and craft of gilding. The society's mission is to preserve traditional gilding skills and techniques, and to promote the highest standards in the practice of gilding.

==History==
A landmark event in the world of gilding took place at the [[Newark Museum]] in [[New Jersey]] during the winter of 1986. While attending a week-long gilding course hosted by the museum’s Arts Workshop, gilders met and exchanged gilding recipes, anecdotes, techniques and ethical concerns. The participants expressed a unanimous desire to extend this collaboration into an organization patterned after the ancient craftsmen’s guilds. Originally called the Guild of Gilders, the group changed their name to the Society of Gilders, welcoming fellow gilders and anyone interested in the art of gilding to join their ranks.

Today the Society of Gilders continues to grow, and the Regional Education Program continues to teach the art of gilding in many disciplines. Conferences have been held in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]] (2000), [[Washington DC]] (2001, 2003, 2006 and 2008), and [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] (2007 to 2013).

==Museum of Gilding Arts==
The Society opened the Museum of Gilding Arts in [[Pontiac, Illinois]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Museum of the Gilding Arts to Open this Saturday in Pontiac, IL|url=http://www.rcreader.com/news-releases/the-museum-of-the-gilding-arts-to-open-this-saturday-in-pontiac-il/|publisher=River Cities Reader|accessdate=9 December 2015|date=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Displays include the history of gold beating, its use as a decorative element and a display of works of art by the Society's members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of the Gilding Arts|url=http://il-pontiactourism.civicplus.com/2190/Museum-of-the-Gilding-Arts|publisher=Visit Pontiac Illinois|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a recreation of the M.

'''field days''' ([[American English]]) or '''Sports days''' ([[British English]]) are events staged by many [[school]]s and [[office]]s in which people participate in competitive [[sport|sporting activities]], often with the aim of winning [[Trophy|trophies]] or [[prizes]]. Though they are often held at the beginning of summer, they are  staged in the autumn or spring seasons, especially in countries where the summer is very harsh. Schools stage many sports days in which children participate in the sporting events. It is usually held in elementary schools, or grades Kindergarten-8th Grade.

In schools which use a [[house system]] a feature of the school is the competition between the houses; this is especially brought out during sporting events such as an inter-house sports day.

Games that are played on school sports days can be wide and varied. They can include straightforward sprints and longer races for all age groups as well as [[egg and spoon race]]s. [[Three legged race]]s are run as well as [[sack race]]s, [[wheelbarrow race]]s, and parent and child races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon|first=Chris|title=Mr|url=http://www.trophiesawardsandgifts.com/blog/organising-a-school-sports-day/|work=Trophies Awards and Gifts Store|publisher=Trophies Awards and Gifts Store|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional games are traditionally run in Ireland, and the UK, such as [[horseshoes]].

==Controversies==

There have been a number of controversies surrounding school sports days in recent years, many of which have been publicised by the media.

Some schools have abolished or heavily altered sports days on the grounds that they are too competitive and may damage pupils' [[self-esteem]], with some commentators calling for the event to be banned due to the public humiliation caused to those children who are not gifted athletically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/jul/14/schoolsports.schools|title=Why I want to ban sports day|first=Clint|last=Witchalls|date=14 July 2004|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been condemned as "[[political correctness]]" by many commentators, notably by journalist [[Melanie Phillips]] in her 1996 book ''All Must Have Prizes''.,&lt;ref name= naga&gt;{{cite web |title=All Must Have Prizes  |author=Melanie Phillips |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a book heavily criticised by reviewers for its prejudiced, fact-less and distorted analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/all-must-have-prizes-by-melanie-phillips-little-brown-pounds-1750-1363087.html|title=All Must Have Prizes By Melanie Phillips Little, Brown pounds 17.50|date=13 September 1996|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' magazine published a report claiming that school sports days have become excessively competitive due to overbearing and "over-zealous" parents, who place too much pressure on their children to succeed. The report also revealed that many schools have banned "mothers and fathers" races due to fighting and cheating.

Since the mid-1990s, a number of schools and education authorities have banned photography and filming with [[video camera]]s at sports days and other school events. Some authorities cite general privacy issues as justification for the ban. Others have raised concerns about [[pedophiles]], which in turn has sparked accusations of hysteria and [[moral panic]]. Many parents have expressed anger at being unable to take photographs or videos as souvenirs of these events, and the ban has been criticised by some as a [[Paranoia|paranoid]] over-reaction to public concerns about pedophilia and child safety issues.

==International==
===India===
In India, sports days are held for 2 - 3 days. These include games like [[football]], [[cricket]], [[throw ball]], [[dodge ball]], [[volleyball]], [[track and field]], [[basketball]] etc. These sports days are held between the various houses in a particular school. In India, many traditional games such as Kho-Kho and Kabaddi, March-past are played.

===Japan===
{{main|Health and Sports Day}}
Sports day, called ''undōkai'' (運動会) in Japanese, is usually held on a Saturday or Sunday in [[Education in Japan|Japanese schools]].  During weeks preceding the sports day, students practice their events which they would like to show their parents and friends, within their class of physical education, which often includes ''[[tamaire]]'', performances by the school band and presentations by various school clubs as well as individual and group competitive events.  These practices, and the sports days themselves, normally take place on the schools' fields, which provide little relief from the heat and sun.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Some schools have responded by scheduling their sports days during cooler months and by encouraging their students to drink water regularly. Currently, the event occurs most often in the autumn (September/October), or in the spring (May/June). In [[Primary education|primary school]]s in [[Hokkaidō]], the event is usually held between the later part of May and the earlier part of June.&lt;ref&gt;Fukue, Natsuko, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20101019i1.html No escaping annual sports days]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 19 October 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Sports Day in [[Russia]] is held on the second Saturday in August. 

===Qatar===
Sports day in [[Qatar]] is a national holiday, held every second-Tuesday of February every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = اليوم الرياضي الوطني - Qatar Sports for all Federation|url = http://sportday.qa|website = Qatar Sports for all Federation|access-date = 2016-02-08|language = ar-AR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Qatar Olympic Committee]] is tasked with organizing the large-scale nationwide activities that are held all over Qatar, and include a wide variety of sports such as; football, basketball, tennis, marathons, open walks, as well as regional sports such as camel riding. Other venues of sports day include [[Aspire Zone]], Katara, [[The Pearl-Qatar|The Pearl]], among others. Sports day's popularity extends to the point that [[Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani|Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani]], Qatar's Emir is casually seen participating in events.

==In offices==
Many large organizations have sports days for their employees. One notable example is [[Her Majesty's Civil Service]] in the UK, which holds a number of departmental sports days.

== History ==
[[Image:RectoradoUCA.jpg|thumb|200px|''Casa de los 5 Gremios'', today the University Main Building]]
The University's origins lie in the 15th century with the "Colegio de Pilotos de los Mares de Levante y Poniente".

Its Faculty of Medicine traces its founding to the Royal Naval College of Surgery in 1748, which was the first in Europe to combine medicine and [[surgery]] in a single school.

The modern University of Cádiz was founded on October 30, 1979, with an inaugural session "''Cajal, análisis literario de un carácter''" about [[Ramón y Cajal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uca.es/web/organizacion/dossier/historia_25/1979|title=Universidad de Cádiz|author=Universidad de Cádiz|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220061704/http://www.uca.es/web/organizacion/dossier/historia_25/1979|archive-date=20 February 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first rector election was conducted in 1984.

In March 1984, the Gold Medal was awarded to [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]]. In May 1985, [[Rafael Alberti]] and [[Antonio Domínguez Ortiz]] were invested Doctor Honoris Causa. In this year, the rectorate is relocated to the current building, ''Casa de los Cinco Gremios''. University bylaws and statutes were approved in February 1986.

In 1992, ''Centro Andaluz Superior de Estudios Marinos'' was inaugurated in Campus of Puerto Real.

Since 2003, UCA has promoted new technologies for learning-related purposes, first with [[WebCT]] [[virtual campus]] and then [[Moodle]] (free software).

In 2009, the recently created "General Inspection of Exceptional Services" begun to make decisions which were severely reprobed by some intellectual authors, for it allows authorities the use of official means in order to arbitrarily punish teaching staff.

== Campuses ==
In addition to the principal campus in Cádiz, the university has three satellite campuses:
*[[Algeciras|Bahía de Algeciras]] Campus
*[[Jerez de la Frontera]] Campus
*Campus of [[Puerto real campus|Puerto Real]]: near to [[Bahía de Cádiz Natural Park]]. The main building is the [[Centro Andaluz Superior de Estudios Marinos]]; ''CASEM'' which offers studies in Marine Environment and Marine Resources, Seafaring, Marine Engineering, Naval Radioelectronics and Naval Engineering.

==History==
[[File:CGSPosvarHall.JPG|thumb|right|Home of the College of General Studies on the first floor of [[Posvar Hall]]]]
The College of General Studies evolved from the 1908  Downtown Division of the Pittsburgh Academy.&lt;ref name="reorganize"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utimes.pitt.edu/?p=139|first=Peter|last=Hart|title=CGS reorganizes to reflect needs of nontraditional students|journal=University Times|date=June 11, 2003|volume=36|number=6|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It became the Department of Afternoon, Saturday and Evening Studies in 1911 when it moved from [[Downtown Pittsburgh|Downtown]] to [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] and began offering a limited number of off-campus courses.  By 1920, Pitt had expanded its off-campus offerings to 19 locations in western Pennsylvania and [[Ohio]], including Erie and Youngstown.  In 1932, Pitt established the University Extension Division, which became known informally as the evening program, with its director reporting directly to the chancellor. On March 11, 1958, the Pitt Board of Trustees, following a recommendation by then Chancellor [[Edward Litchfield]], approved the establishment of the School of General Studies primarily as an alternative for adults wishing to continuing education. Enrollment in the School of General Studies peaked at 18,930 during the 1974-75 academic year, the vast majority of which were part-time students. In 1981, the School of General Studies was renamed the College of General Studies to reflect that its degree was comparable to an [[University of Pittsburgh School of Arts and Sciences|Arts and Sciences]] degree.&lt;ref name="anniversary"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utimes.pitt.edu/?p=6692|first=Peter|last=Hart|title=CGS marks 50 years as a school|journal=University Times|date=October 23, 2008|volume=41|number=5|location=Pittsburgh, PA|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, the College of General Studies offered as many as 30 degree majors, which was downgraded to ten in 1998-99 in order to eliminate duplication with majors offered in other Pitt units.&lt;ref name="highlights"/&gt; In 2002 the McCarl Center for Nontraditional Student Success open followed by a major restructuring of the College of General Studies in 2003.&lt;ref name="reorganize" /&gt; The [[Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes|Osher Lifelong Learning Institute]], for those 50 years old and older, and CGSOnline was established in 2005.&lt;ref name="highlights" /&gt;

'''Varsity''' is an alteration and shortening of the term ''university''. The meaning differs depending on the region, but is usually related to sporting activity.

==Varsity in the United Kingdom==
{{Main|Varsity match}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], '''varsity team''' or varsity club refers to groups participating in [[varsity match]]es in sport or other competitions between [[University rivalry#United Kingdom|rival universities]]. The term originally referred strictly to university-sponsored teams, and dates from the 1840s.&lt;ref name=DictDotCom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/varsity?s=t|title=Definition of 'varsity'|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary [[Scots language]] the term ''varsity'' is often interchangeable with ''university'' &lt;ref name="The Online Scots Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scots-online.org/dictionary/scots_english.asp|title=Definition of 'varsity'|work=Scots-online.org|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contexts unrelated to sporting activity.

==Varsity in North America==
In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] '''varsity teams''' are the principal athletic teams representing a [[college]], [[university]], [[high school]], or other [[secondary school]]. Such teams compete against similar teams at corresponding educational institutions.  Groups of varsity sports teams are often organized into [[athletic conference]]s, which are groups of teams that regularly play each other during a given athletic season. In recognition of their high level of performance, athletes on varsity teams are often given [[varsity letter]]s.  They are in contrast to the institution's [[Collegiate club sports|club sports]].  

A major difference between varsity and club sports is the source for allocated funds. Varsity teams receive financial support, equipment, and facilities from college and university athletic department budgets.&lt;ref name="UNBcuts"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Company]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2008/03/14/unb-varsity.html|title=UNB cuts teams eligible for varsity athletics funding|date=March 14, 2008|accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universities often allocate club sport budgets through student life departments similar to other clubs on campus. Because club sports cost more than other clubs, many club student-athletes must [[pay to play]] and also engage in team fundraising efforts to pay for facilities time, equipment, and other team expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jon|last=Van Zytveld|publisher=[[Grand Valley Lanthorn]]|url=http://www.gvsustudentlifesports.com/article/234.php|title=Club Sports Offer Athletic Opportunities|date=Oct 26, 2011|accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At various levels of collegiate sports, varsity student athletes are eligible for [[scholarships]] solely or partially based on athletic skills.&lt;ref name="UNBcuts"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[University of Illinois]]|url=http://www.athletics.illinois.edu/development/contributions/default.htm|title=Illinois Athletic Development|accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Varsity can be compared with the [[junior varsity]] level, which is typically for less-experienced [[underclassmen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naia.org/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209264280|title=Varsity vs. Junior Varsity|website=NAIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players may be able to go up a level to varsity playing by performing well.

==Varsity in the Netherlands==
In the [[Netherlands]], the Varsity is the oldest and most prestigious rowing race. It was held for the first time in 1878, and was started as a Dutch equivalent for the Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge.

==Varsity in South Africa==
{{see also|Varsity Football (South Africa)}}
In [[South Africa]] and some other [[Commonwealth countries]], varsity is often still used in place of the word university, in contexts unrelated to sporting activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=137931|title=Expo highlights tech student innovators|website=ITWeb|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1762">'''Vera Nemtchinova''' (10 September 1900 – 28 June 1984) was a Russian ballet dancer.

She was born in Moscow, and studied with Lydia Nelidova of the Bolshoi Ballet. She joined [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] in 1915. There, she created the role of the androgynous "garçonne" in [[Bronislava Nijinska]]'s 1924 ballet ''[[Les Biches]],'' and leading roles in other modern works. After leaving the Ballets Russes in 1927 she set up her own company, with [[Anton Dolin]], engaging [[George Balanchine]] and others as choreographers.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;Kisselgoff, Anna. [https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/24/obituaries/vera-nemtchinova-84-dies-diaghilev-star-and-teacher.html "Vera Nemtchinova, 84, Dies; Diaghilev Star and Teacher"], ''The New York Times'', 24 July 1984, p. B6&lt;/ref&gt;

After she retired from dancing Nemtchinova settled in New York in 1947, where she established a studio as a ballet teacher. She was twice married, both times to dancers: first Nicolas Sverev (with whom she had danced in the Diaghilev company) and then Anatole Oboukhov, of the [[Mariinsky Ballet]] company. She died in New York, at the age of 84.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9357">The '''West Virginia University M.B.A. controversy''' concerns the granting of an [[Master of Business Administration#Executive MBA (EMBA)|Executive Master of Business Administration degree]] (EMBA) by [[West Virginia University]] to [[Mylan]] pharmaceutical company executive [[Heather Bresch]] in 2007. An independent panel later concluded that the university changed its records, and granted the degree despite incomplete graduation requirements. West Virginia University's president [[Michael Garrison (politician)|Michael Garrison]],  its [[Provost (education)|provost]] Gerald Lang,  and its business school dean R. Stephen Sears, resigned as a result of the investigation, and the university's general counsel and the president's communications officer relinquished those roles.

== Initial questions ==

On October 2, 2007 Heather Bresch, the daughter of then-[[Governor (United States)|governor]] (and subsequently [[United States Senator]]) [[Joe Manchin]] of West Virginia, was promoted to chief operating officer at [[Mylan]], a [[Cecil Township, Pennsylvania]]-based generic drug maker.&lt;ref name="Mystery"&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 2007 the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' contacted West Virginia University to confirm academic credentials claimed by Bresch, including an EMBA degree.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt;  Research done by the ''Post-Gazette'' indicated that Bresch's course work ceased with 22 out of the 48-credit-hour program remaining to be completed.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt; The WVU Registrar told the newspaper that Bresch had earned an undergraduate degree, but did not finish her graduate degree. However, on October 15, 2007, a university spokeswoman announced that WVU officials had verified that Bresch had "completed all the requirements for an executive masters of business administration degree," but did not receive her diploma because she failed to pay a $50 graduation fee.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt; The WVU official attributed the misunderstanding to the business school's failure to transfer records from nearly half of Bresch's course work.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt;

On October 22, 2007, R. Stephen Sears, the Milan Puskar Dean of WVU's business school, sent a letter to WVU's admissions and records office retroactively granting Bresch an EMBA. Six classes were added to her record with letter grades, and two classes with "Incomplete" grades were given letter grades.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt;

==Panel==
The University commissioned a report  written by a panel of faculty members from WVU and other universities to look into the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.facultysenate.wvu.edu/report/panel_report_4-23-08.pdf report]&lt;/ref&gt; As covered by the ''Post-Gazette'', the panel discovered the change in Bresch's letter grades, and the University announced in April 2008 that it would rescind Bresch's degree.&lt;ref name=postgazette&gt;Boselovic, Len, and Patricia Sabatini, "[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08115/876164-298.stm University revokes degree after scathing report on M.B.A. awarded to Bresch]", ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', 24 April 2008, accessed 2008-04-26&lt;/ref&gt; WVU provost Gerald Lang announced his resignation&lt;ref name=nyt0804&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/us/28westvirginia.html "Provost Quits Over Degree to Governor’s Child"], ''New York Times'', 28 April 2008, accessed 2008-04-28&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly thereafter College of Business &amp; Economics Dean Stephen Sears announced his resignation as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wvgazette.com/latest/200804280173 "WVU dean 2nd to resign in degree scandal"], ''The Charleston Gazette'', 28 April 2008, accessed 2008-04-28&lt;/ref&gt;

The report's panel found that high-ranking university administrators "cherry-picked" information and that grades were "simply pulled from thin air" to grant Bresch the degree nearly 10 years after she was supposed to graduate. The panel concluded administrators lacked documentation to prove Bresch's claims, relied too heavily on verbal assertions and caved to political pressure. The report did not find that the university president directly interfered, but it concluded the presence of his chief of staff in the decision-making meeting created "palpable" pressure.   The panel concluded (“taking the most charitable view") that Bresch did not deliberately lie in believing that she had earned degree. &lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/2016/08/26/epipen-mylan-ceo-interview-heather-bresch-mba/ Mylan CEO's 'Heather Bresch Situation': Before EpiPen, the MBA Scandal]  [[Fortune (magazine)]] Jen Wieczener,  August 26, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and repercussions==
On May 1, 2008, the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', which first reported on the controversy, published an [[editorial]] calling for the President [[Michael Garrison (politician)|Michael Garrison]]'s resignation.&lt;ref name="holdout"&gt;{{cite news

On May 5, 2008, WVU's faculty senate passed a non-binding resolution 77-19 that stated: "The Faculty Senate of West Virginia University votes no confidence in President Garrison. For the good of the institution and for the benefit of our students, he must resign or the Board of Governors must require his resignation."&lt;ref name="vote"/&gt; One emeritus member of the faculty called the grade alterations by the WVU administration a "serious academic crime" by subverting the faculty's traditional authority.&lt;ref name="vote"&gt;{{cite news

Garrison subsequently resigned and was replaced by interim President C. Peter Magrath. Magrath served for a year before James P. Clements was named to be the next president.

In addition, the university's general counsel stepped down as general counsel but remained vice president of legal affairs. The president's communications officer was reassigned to another job in the university.&lt;ref&gt;''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', "WVU Panelists Stand by report", http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08153/886523-298.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WorldWideWhiteboard''' is a Web-based online collaboration and conferencing tool designed for use in distance education. The WorldWideWhiteboard domain, trademark, and technology are owned and developed by [[Link-Systems International, Inc.]] (LSI), a privately held [[Distance education|distance-learning]] software corporation in Tampa, Florida. The WorldWideWhiteboard went live in 1996&lt;ref name="LSIPage"/&gt; under the name "NetTutor," although the LSI [[NetTutor|NetTutor online tutoring service]] is technically just one implementation of the WorldWideWhiteboard product. Version 3.8 of the WorldWideWhiteboard is in use not only in the current NetTutor online tutoring service, but also in on-campus online tutoring programs, online courses, and collaborative learning environments in the U.S. and around the world. As a Java applet, it can be run on [[Windows]], [[Macintosh|Mac]], and [[Linux]] and runs without downloading software. LSI maintains the application and leases both hosted and unhosted access to it. LSI operations &amp;mdash; tutoring, product development, online content services, management, and technical support &amp;mdash; are housed in the company's Tampa offices.&lt;ref name="BWInfo"/&gt;

==History==

The WorldWideWhiteboard is the first software product developed by Link-Systems International (LSI). LSI was launched in 1995 primarily as a company that converted text-based content like scholarly journals into an [[SGML]] format. Incorporated in the State of Florida on February 27, 1996, LSI expanded its mission to the Web-based implementation of a variety of traditionally face-to-face academic activities. The company developed what it called the "Net Tutor" product that included a  whiteboard-like interface and, later, a tutoring service that used the whiteboard to conduct [[Online Tutoring|online tutoring]]. For about five years, the software side of this product leased as NetTutor to  schools, individual educators, and programs, for example to conduct online tutoring using tutors provided by the institution, as well as for online instruction and office hours. Eventually, LSI re-christened the interface the WorldWideWhiteboard. The company still owns the [[NetTutor]] trademark, which refers to the online tutoring it supplies via the WorldWideWhiteboard and using professional tutors it employs.&lt;ref name="BWDigest"/&gt;

This history seems to justify the company's claim that it was the first to offer commercially a tool for Web access to a shared, real-time environment with such education-oriented features as subject-specific tool bars. The WorldWideWhiteboard was also adopted as an option available with certain text-books by publishers such as [[McGraw-Hill]],&lt;ref name="MH"/&gt; [[John Wiley and Sons]], [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]], [[Cengage Learning]],&lt;ref name="CengSite"/&gt; and [[Bedford-St. Martin's|Bedford, Freeman and Worth]]. The use of the WorldWideWhiteboard by campuses and educational programs to support online environments, give classes, hold faculty office hours and meetings expanded over the next decade.

In 2010, LSI began development of an [[HTML5]] version of the WorldWideWhiteboard. This version has now replaced the earlier, Java-based version and allows for the use of the interface on mobile devices. This is one of several cases where software developers have opted for browser-based development, counting on the future development of HTML5 [[API]]'s to support audio and video interaction, rather than self-standing phone apps. As of 2013, installations of WorldWideWhiteboard had been converted from Java-based to HTML5-based versions.

As the WorldWideWhiteboard gained more popularity, LSI came to be included in the Inc. 5000 in 2014.&lt;ref name="Inc"/&gt;

==Breadth of use==

The WorldWideWhiteboard product was apparently the first successful web collaboration tool in wide use in education. [[Online whiteboard]]s generally can accommodate a theoretically unlimited number of participants and an instructor in a [[synchronous]], i.e., live interactive session. The WorldWideWhiteboard allows for both audio and up to four video streams, as well as numerous [[asynchronous learning|asynchronous]] modes of interaction.

* Early research into the WorldWideWhiteboard or NetTutor includes that of educators eager to employ technology in their own teaching.  A study at [[Hampton University]] in 1999 concluded that the WorldWideWhiteboard could effectively support such activities as online office hours.&lt;ref name="Verma1999"/&gt;
* A virtual whiteboard must provide drawing and symbol-placement tools adequate to the discussion of subjects both by faculty and unskilled learners. A study at [[Stony Brook University]] comparing the WorldWideWhiteboard with tools available in Blackboard concluded in 2004 that "[d]espite some flaws, according to our research NetTutor remains the only workable math-friendly e-learning communication system."&lt;ref name="Smith2004"/&gt;
* The WorldWideWhiteboard supported the online tutoring programs of individual universities, such as at [[Utah Valley State College]], in a study describing its use as "[o]ne of the earliest synchronous models for math  tutoring]".&lt;ref name="Turrentine2006"/&gt;
* The WorldWideWhiteboard was used to coordinate education across multiple campuses occurred at the [[University of Idaho]], in a study beginning in 2005&lt;ref name="Thomas2006"/&gt; &amp;mdash; showing increasing acceptance of Web-based  online tutoring in the university setting.

Certain of these studies have been cited widely, mainly because of the seminal role of the WorldWideWhiteboard as an educational Web-conferencing tool. (See, for instance, Reushle and Loch in "Conducting a Trial Web Conferencing Software."&lt;ref name="ReuschleLoch2008"/&gt; and the Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College Quality Enhancement Plan for 2007&lt;ref name="ABAC2007"/&gt;)

This research suggests that all the forms of expression &amp;mdash; including video and audio interaction &amp;mdash; available on the WorldWideWhiteboard can be successfully used in the classroom.

Other questions raised by scholars include:

* How comfortable is the average learner with the technology of the WorldWideWhiteboard?&lt;ref name="Verma1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas2006"/&gt;
* Does the conversation with an online educator &amp;mdash; even a "live" one &amp;mdash; fully synthesize the give and take of the classroom environment?&lt;ref name="Smith2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turrentine2006"/&gt;

While these questions, educators agree, are not fully decided, more recent study suggests that the student-centered dialog possible on the WorldWideWhiteboard encourages learner persistence and success.

==Degree of customization==

The technology of the WorldWideWhiteboard is not geared to a particular pedagogic or andragogic approach. Its set of activities can therefore be used by any educator for online communication. This also means that questions about how the WorldWideWhiteboard is set up are matters for the institution to decide. LSI has no consultancy component, so that, while figures about usage of the WorldWideWhiteboard can be used to demonstrate how a school's Quality Enhancement  Program is working, it is up to the user to create the documentation for this or any other accreditation-related measures.&lt;ref name="IHE"/&gt;

However, each features of the WorldWideWhiteboard can be customized for use in different institutions and for different subjects. The appearance of the dashboard, symbols displayed on the whiteboard interface can be customized, as well. As an example, fractions and graphing tools may appear on an Algebra class whiteboard, while there may be integral signs as well on the toolbar for a Calculus course.

==History==
[[File:ImagenORT.jpg|thumb|ORT in Argentina]]
The second partition of [[Poland]] in 1793 had resulted in a sharp increase in the number of Jews in Russia, so that in 1794 Empress [[Catherine the Great]] decreed that the majority of them would henceforth be restricted to living and working in the [[Pale of Settlement]]. The Jews were not allowed to leave the Pale or own land outside it. They were removed from their homes and villages and once resettled, barred from all but a handful of professions. The crowded conditions and legal barriers to self-sufficiency led to deepening poverty for the Pale's four million inhabitants. After the reforms of [[Tsar Alexander II]] in the 1860s, the situation improved for some Jews but those in the Pale remained trapped by economic hardship and dismal conditions. In 1880,  [[Samuel Polyakov]], [[Horace de Gunzburg]] and [[Nikolai Bakst]]  petitioned [[Tsar Alexander II]] for permission to start an assistance fund which would improve the lives of the millions of  Russian Jews then living in poverty. The fund would provide education and training in practical occupations like handicrafts and agricultural skills and would help people to help themselves.

Permission was granted and the appeal was sent out, signed by Poliakov and de Gunzburg as well as Abram Zak, Leon Rosenthal and Meer Fridland, leading to the establishment of the Society for Trades and Agricultural Labor among the Jews in Russia was established. In its first 25 years, ORT raised educational standards and provided training to 25,000 Jews across the [[Russian Empire]]. People trained as artisans in glass-blowing, learned sewing and gardening, trained as mechanics, cabinetmakers, and furniture designers &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ort.org/asp/article.asp?id=117 About ORT]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first programs created by ORT were dictated by the demands of the market. In 1909, the industrialization in Russia created a need for artisans, so ORT developed courses for electricians in [[Vilna]] where electric streetcars were being introduced. They offered automotive courses in [[St. Petersburg]] when the automobile began taking root there in 1910. ORT’s training programs varied to meet the needs of Jews depending on where they lived and what the gaps in the workforce were. That flexibility and diversity meant that ORT became an established educational leader in  many fields within only its first few decades of existence.

After World War I, ORT  opened agricultural schools to provide tools and  training  for agricultural enterprises. ORT headquarters moved  to [[Berlin]] in 1921, after the Bolshevik Revolution. Initially, the Berlin office dealt mainly with fundraising and support for Jewish education in other countries where the Jews were less well-off. When the Nazis rose to power in 1933, Jewish children were expelled from German schools. ORT sought to open a school in Berlin but encountered difficulties due to the ban on selling property to Jews. Using its international ties, the British branch of ORT purchased a school building and dormitory in     the Moabit quarter of Berlin. It received authorization to open in April 1937 after promising that all graduates would leave the country upon graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/the-last-jewish-school-in-berlin-1.423958|title=The last Jewish school in Berlin|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Later ORT headquarters moved to [[France]] and finally to [[Geneva]]. Local groups such as [[American ORT]] and Women's American ORT, ORT Canada and British ORT were formed to support the growing network of programs. In 1938, Stalinist purges forced the closure of ORT programs in the [[Soviet Union]].

During World War II, ORT continued to serve Jewish communities, including those under Nazi occupation. In the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], the German authorities gave ORT permission to open vocational training courses. Those courses continued throughout the war and until the liquidation of the Ghetto. They served as a template for similar ORT programs in other Jewish centers like [[Łódź]] and [[Kaunas]].

After the end of World War II, ORT established rehabilitation programs for the survivors. The first one in Germany was started in August 1945 in the [[Landsberg DP camp]].&lt;ref&gt;YIVO, DPG folder 1925, "Baricht fun der ORT-Tetikajt in der US-Zone fun Dajtsland farn Jor 1947."&lt;/ref&gt; Vocational training centers were set up in 78 DP (Displaced Persons) Camps in Germany, and nearly 85,000 people acquired professions and the tools they would need to rebuild their lives. [[Jacob Olejski]], a [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] survivor who had previously organized ORT in [[Lithuania]], was the driving force behind ORT's revival in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Avinoam J. Patt, ''Finding Home and Homeland: Jewish Youth and Zionism in the Aftermath of the Holocaust'' (Wayne State University Press, 2009), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Margalith, Jacob Olejski and Louis Walinsky, ''ORT in US-Zone Germany'' (World ORT Union, Central Office Munich, US-Zone, Germany, 1948), 41 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1948 he organized ORT in the newly founded state of [[Israel]].
[[File:Students at ORT Jaffa.jpg|thumb|ORT in Jaffa, 1947]]
ORT operations in [[Israel]] started in [[Jaffa]] and [[Jerusalem]], and although the [[Iron Curtain]] forced the closure of ORT’s activities in Eastern Europe, in the 1950s Ort activity increased in  Western Europe, [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]], [[Iran]] and [[India]].

During the second half of the 20th century, ORT continued to provide education and relief services to Jewish communities in Israel, Africa and Asia while opening new programs to serve the Latin American Jewish communities in Argentina ([[ORT Argentina]]), Brazil and Uruguay ([[ORT Uruguay]]).  In the early 1990s ORT returned to the former Soviet Union and the Baltic States, where it now serves 27,000 students in 58 schools and educational institutions every year.

In 2000, World ORT celebrated its 120th anniversary. The educational services provided through their network continues and has now been supplemented by programs intended to deliver basic nutrition, clothing, books and school supplies, counseling and other services designed to meet the growing emotional needs of students as well &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ortamerica.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_hist_ort|title=OrtAmerica|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current and ongoing programs==
In addition to technical and financial support for its network of schools and programs in 60 countries around the world, World ORT has developed additional campaigns:

* '''The Latin America Campaign''': In 2006-7, ORT began a major program of new projects intended to create a sense of unity and connection throughout the region and meeting the highly individual and specific needs of each community. This campaign is active in small Jewish communities as well as larger ones. For example, the two [[ORT Argentina]] high schools in Buenos Aires are overcrowded and a new high school is being planned to accommodate the students there. At the same time, the Jewish community in Montevideo (where ORT operates a four year university), is getting much needed scholarship funds and while the community in Mexico city will soon benefit from the new new digital media center being built.
* '''Science Journey in Israel''': Science Journey is a new $7.4 million program that delivers electronic, science and computer labs as well as technology education to students in more than 30 schools throughout Israel, most of which are in northern Israel, and suffered the brunt of last summer’s war with Hezbollah, and in those in areas which are prone to rocket attack from Gaza. The new computer labs and whiteboard technology provide a new opportunity for students. The program works with local authorities, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education, and marks a new phase in ORT’s 59-year-long commitment to bring the best practical education available to the Jewish State.
* '''Regeneration CIS''': This aims to bring quality Judaic and general high school education to Jewish communities throughout the independent sovereign states of the region that was formerly the Soviet Union. ORT plans to include in the new program 18 schools and centers in Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Belarus and Kyrgyzstan. In order to complete its mission for the renewed program, ORT will ensure that equipment and services in existing centers are maintained and fully operational, to upgrade systems to enable them to deliver enhanced options, to provide school-wide training to ensure that all staff is able to deliver the new materials, and to provide ongoing staffing and resources. In the new centers, ORT will carry out necessary refurbishments, plan and install new systems and services, train staff, and provide ongoing staffing and support.

==Locations==

* '''North America''': Locations of ORT colleges in North America include campuses in New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bramsonort.edu/|title=Bramson ORT - Local College in Queens, Brooklyn, NYC|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ortamerica.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ortamerica.org/site/PageServer?pagename=edu_prog_usa|title=OrtAmerica|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Los Angeles,&lt;ref name="ortamerica.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.laort.edu/|title=Top Los Angeles Non Profit Junior College|date=9 November 2014|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chicago.&lt;ref name="ortamerica.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ortchicagotech.edu/]&lt;/ref&gt;
