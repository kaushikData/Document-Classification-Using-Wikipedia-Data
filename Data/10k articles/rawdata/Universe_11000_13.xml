In the case of ionic crystals, the fluxes of the diffusing species are coupled,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://old.iupac.org/publications/pac/1999/71_07_pdf/kizilyalli.pdf | title=Definitions of terms for diffusion in the solid state (IUPAC Recommendations 1999)|journal= Pure Appl.

== Diffusion in plasmas ==

In [[plasma physics]], ambipolar diffusion is closely related to the concept of [[Plasma (physics)#Potentials|quasineutrality]]. In most [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]s, the forces acting on the [[ion]]s are different from those acting on the [[electron]]s, so naively one would expect one species to be transported faster than the other, whether by [[diffusion]] or [[convection]] or some other process. If such differential transport has a [[divergence]], then it results in a change of the [[charge density]]. The latter will in turn create an electric field that can alter the transport of one or both species in such a way that they become equal.

The simplest example is a plasma localized in an unmagnetized [[vacuum]]. (See [[Inertial confinement fusion]].) Both electrons and ions will stream outward with their respective [[thermal velocity]]. If the ions are relatively cold, their thermal velocity will be small. The thermal velocity of the electrons will be fast due to their high temperature and low mass: &lt;math&gt;v_e \approx \sqrt{k_BT_e/m_e}&lt;/math&gt;. As the electrons leave the initial volume, they will leave behind a positive charge density of ions, which will result in an outwardly-directed electric field. This field will act on the electrons to slow them down and on the ions to speed them up. The net result is that both ions and electrons stream outward at the [[Plasma parameters#Velocities|speed of sound]], &lt;math&gt;c_s \approx \sqrt{k_BT_e/m_i}&lt;/math&gt;, which is much smaller than the electron thermal velocity, but usually much larger than the ion thermal velocity.

In [[astrophysics]], "ambipolar diffusion" refers specifically to the [[Nuclear magnetic resonance decoupling|decoupling]] of neutral particles from plasma, for example in the initial stage of star formation. The neutral particles in this case are mostly [[hydrogen]] molecules in a cloud that would undergo [[gravitational collapse]] if they were not collisionally coupled to the plasma. The plasma is composed of ions (mostly [[protons]]) and electrons, which are tied to the interstellar magnetic field and therefore resist collapse. In a [[molecular cloud]] where the fractional ionization is very low (one part per million or less), neutral particles only rarely encounter charged particles, and so are not entirely hindered in their collapse (note that now is dynamical collapse, not free fall) into a [[star]].

The '''Belo Monte Dam''' (''formerly known as'' '''Kararaô''') is a [[hydroelectric dam]] complex currently under construction on the northern part of the [[Xingu River]] in the [[Pará|state of Pará]], [[Brazil]]. The planned installed capacity of the dam complex would be 11,233&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]]s (MW), which would make it the second largest hydroelectric dam complex in Brazil and [[List of largest hydroelectric power stations|fourth largest in the world]] by installed capacity, behind the [[Three Gorges Dam]] and the [[Xiluodu Dam]] in [[People's Republic of China|China]] and the Brazilian-[[Paraguay]]an [[Itaipu Dam]]. 
Considering the oscillations of flow river, guaranteed minimum capacity generation from the Belo Monte Dam would measure 4,571&amp;nbsp;MW, 39% of its maximum capacity.&lt;ref name=aneel&gt;

Brazil's rapid economic growth over the last decade has provoked a huge demand for new and stable sources of energy, especially to supply its growing industries. In Brazil, [[hydroelectric power plants]] produce over 85% of the electrical energy. The Government has decided to construct new hydroelectric dams to guarantee national [[energy security]]. 
However, there is opposition both within Brazil and among the international community to the project's potential construction regarding its economic viability, the generation efficiency of the dams and in particular its impacts on the region's people and environment. In addition, critics worry that construction of the Belo Monte Dam could make the construction of other dams upstream- which could have greater impacts- more viable.
 
Plans for the dam began in 1975 but were soon shelved due to controversy; they were later revitalized in the late 1990s. 
In the 2000s, the dam was redesigned, but faced renewed controversy and controversial impact assessments were carried out. 
On 26 August 2010, a contract was signed with Norte Energia to construct the dam once the [[IBAMA|Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA)]] had issued an installation license. 
A partial installation license was granted on 26 January 2011 and a full license to construct the dam was issued on 1 June 2011. 
The licensing process and the dam's construction have been mired in federal court battles; the current ruling is that construction is allowed, because the license is based on five different environmental technical reports&lt;ref&gt;VIEIRA, Isabel (2011).

The first turbines went online on 5 May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brasil.gov.br/governo/2016/05/dilma-inaugura-usina-hidreletrica-de-belo-monte&lt;/ref&gt; 
The power station is planned to be completed by 2019.

==History==
Plans for what would eventually be called the Belo Monte Dam Complex began in 1975 during [[Brazilian military government|Brazil's military dictatorship]], when [[Eletronorte]] contracted the Consórcio Nacional de Engenheiros Consultores (CNEC) to realize a [[Hydrographic survey|hydrographic]] study to locate potential sites for a hydroelectric project on the Xingu River. CNEC completed its study in 1979 and identified the possibility of constructing five dams on the Xingu River and one dam on the [[Iriri River]].&lt;ref name="elehis"/&gt;

Original plans for the project based on the 1979 study included two dams close to Belo Monte. These were: Kararaô (called Belo Monte after 1989), Babaquara (called Altamira after 1998) which was the next upstream.&lt;ref name="elehis"&gt;{{Cite web|title=AHE Belo Monte – Evolucado Dos Estudos|url=http://www.eletrobras.com/elb/services/eletrobras/ContentManagementPlus/FileDownload.ThrSvc.asp?DocumentID=%7BD7EFE913-EA8E-42A7-8D28-5FFF2C719F46%7D&amp;ServiceInstUID=%7B5947E09B-BDF0-4A21-A48F-518B42072401%7D&amp;InterfaceInstUID=%7B75E11C49-A34C-4276-B9CE-256B5BE9EB6A%7D&amp;InterfaceUID=%7B72215A93-CAA7-4232-A6A1-2550B7CBEE2F%7D&amp;ChannelUID=%7B1D26C51F-7323-4BD4-A98C-C816FC6B58EB%7D&amp;PageUID=%7B46763BB8-3B05-432F-A206-C8F93CC3BA90%7D&amp;BrowserType=IE&amp;BrowserVersion=6|publisher=Eletrobras|accessdate=7 March 2011|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four other dams were planned upstream as well and they include the Ipixuna, Kakraimoro, Iriri and Jarina. The project was part of Eletrobras' "2010 Plan" which included 297 dams that were to be constructed in Brazil by 2010. The plan was leaked early and officially released in December 1987 to an antagonistic public. The plan had Belo Monte to be constructed by 2000 and Altamira by 2005. Such a speedy timetable was due to the belief that Brazil's relatively new environmental regulations could not stop large projects.&lt;ref name="Fearnside"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Fearnside|first=Phillip M.|title=Dams in the Amazon: Belo Monte and Brazil’s Hydroelectric Development of the Xingu River Basin|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:UaT2PxOKbRkJ:philip.inpa.gov.br/publ_livres/Preprints/2006/Belo%2520Monte%2520dec%2520making-EM-3.pdf+cnec+1975+belo+monte&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShMicMyIzdlicp3epTAHvpmhRwhMh17-JB31vVCcarqf2PW_JTco71GzvFGwz3Uq6WkltziP5rC5vSwWsrX0PUKolpwetk6s0-2vGMwoobx0K-ezZbMuRaG7y3ihJK6bCbYRvyN&amp;sig=AHIEtbTG8xKdZsJ2U9z9D6vCPpXqEejiPQ|publisher=Environmental Management|accessdate=7 March 2011|date=12 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government offered little transparency to the people who would be affected regarding its plans for the hydroelectric project, provoking indigenous tribes of the region to organize what they called the ''I Encontro das Nações Indígenas do Xingu'' (First Encounter of the Indigenous Nations of the Xingu) or the "[[Altamira, Brazil|Altamira]] Gathering", in 1989. The encounter, symbolized by the indigenous woman leader Tuíra holding her machete against the face of then-engineer [[Eletrobras#List of current and former CEOs|José Antonio Muniz Lopes]] sparked enormous repercussions both in Brazil and internationally over the plans for the six dams. As a result, the five dams above Belo Monte were removed from planning and Kararaô was renamed to Belo Monte at the request of the people of that tribe. Eletronorte also stated they would "resurvey the fall", meaning resurvey the dams on the river.&lt;ref name="Fearnside"/&gt;&lt;ref name="urlTenotã–mõ Executive Summary"&gt;

===Redesign===
Between 1989 and 2002, the Belo Monte project was redesigned. The reservoir's surface area was reduced from {{Convert|1225|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|440|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} by moving the dam further upstream. The main rationale for this was to reduce flooding of the Bacajá Indigenous Area. In 1998, the Babaquara Dam was again placed into planning but under a new name, the Altamira Dam. This surprised local leaders as they felt plans for the dams above Belo Monte were cancelled. Some officials in Brazil were determined to build a dam on a river with an average flow of {{Convert|7800|m3/s|ft3/s|0|abbr=on}} and at a site that offers a {{Convert|87.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} drop. One engineer said of the dam: "God only makes a place like Belo Monte once in a while. This place was made for a dam."&lt;ref name="Fearnside"/&gt; President of Eletronorte, José Muniz Lopes, in an interview with the newspaper O Liberal (Belo Monte entusiasma an Eletronorte por Sônia Zaghetto, 15 July 2001), affirmed: &lt;blockquote&gt;"''Within the electric sector's planning for the period 2010/2020, we’re looking at three dams – Marabá (Tocantins river), Altamira (previously called Babaquara, Xingu River) and Itaituba (São Luís do Tapajós). Some journalists say that we are not talking about these dams because we’re trying to hide them. It’s just that their time has not yet come. We’re now asking for authorization to intensify our studies for these dams. Brazil would be greatly benefited if we could follow Belo Monte with Marabá, then Altamira and Itaituba.''"&lt;ref name="UrlTenotã–mõ Executive Summary" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Second study===
In 2002, Eletronorte presented a new environmental impact assessment for the Belo Monte Dam Complex, which presented three alternatives. Alternative A included the six original dams planned in 1975. Alternative B included a reduction to four dams, dropping Jarina and Iriri. Alternative C included a reduction to Belo Monte only. The new environmental impact assessment contained reductions in reservoir size and the introduction of a [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the-river]] model, in contrast to the large reservoirs characteristic of the 1975 plans.&lt;ref&gt;

Also in 2002, Workers' Party leader [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] earned a victory in his campaign for president, having originally run unsuccessful campaigns in [[Brazilian presidential election, 1989|1989]], [[Brazilian general election, 1994|1994]] and [[Brazilian general election, 1998|1998]]. Lula soon brokered political deals with the center and right-wing sectors in 2003, especially with ex-president [[José Sarney]] of the state of Maranhão of the PMDB, which would set the precedent that eventually characterized the two Lula administrations: [[Public/social/private partnership|cooperation between the market and the state]], a combination of a free market economy with larger social spending and welfare. This economic model provided the rationale and financial support for new efforts to construct Belo Monte. In 2007, at the beginning of Lula's second term in office, a new national investment program was introduced: the [[Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento]] (Program to Accelerate Growth). The Belo Monte Dam Complex figured as an anchor project of the new investment plan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 2008, another new environmental impact assessment was written, this time by Eletrobras with the participation of [[Odebrecht]], [[Camargo Corrêa]], and [[Andrade Gutierrez]], which formally accepted Alternative C or the construction only of the Belo Monte dam itself. The assessment also presented further design changes; in order to avoid inundating indigenous territory, which is not permitted by the Brazilian Constitution, the new design included two canals to divert the water away from indigenous territories and into a reservoir called the ''Reservatorio dos Canais'' (Canals Reservoir). An additional reservoir would be created called the ''Reservatorio da Calha do Xingu'' (Xingu Riverbed Reservoir), and electricity would be generated from the two reservoirs using three dams: a complementary powerhouse called Pimental (233 MW), a complementary spillway called Bela Vista, and the main powerhouse called Belo Monte (11,000 MW). The ''Reservatorio dos Canais'' would be retained by over a dozen large dikes, and water from the reservoirs would be channeled towards the main powerhouse.&lt;ref&gt;

However, transparency of the government's plans once again became an issue, sparking indigenous tribes of the region to organize another large meeting, called the ''Segundo Encontro dos Povos do Xingu'' (the Second Encounter of the Peoples of the Xingu) in the city of Altamira, Pará on 20 May 2008.&lt;ref name="urlBBC - Bruce Parrys Amazon-The Kayapo"&gt;

===First license granted===
In February 2010, Brazilian environmental agency IBAMA granted a provisional environmental license, one of three licenses required by Brazilian legislation for development projects. The provisional license approved the 2008 environmental impact assessment and permitted the project auction to take place in April 2010.&lt;ref name="urlBBC News-environmental licence-Belo Monte dam"&gt;

On 26 August 2010, President [[Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva]] signed the contract with the Norte Energia at a ceremony in Brasília. Construction was not permitted to begin on the Belo Monte Dam Complex until IBAMA granted the second of the federally required environmental licenses, called the Installation License. The Installation License was only to be granted once Norte Energia shows indisputable proof that it has met 40&amp;nbsp;socio-environmental mitigation conditions upon which the first provisional environmental license was conditioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/recomenda_saude_educacao_saneamento.PDF|title=Recomendação Parecer 95/2010|work=Ministério Público Federal do Pará|year=2010|publisher=[[International Rivers]]|language=Portuguese|format=PDF|trans-title=Recommendation 95/2010|accessdate=11 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726182756/http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/recomenda_saude_educacao_saneamento.PDF|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an October 2010 IBAMA report, at least 23 conditions had not been met.&lt;ref name=LBC&gt;{{cite web|title=Tug of War Over Belo Monte Dam|url=http://www.latinbusinesschronicle.com/app/article.aspx?id=4789|publisher=Latin Business Chronicle|accessdate=9 March 2011|date=28 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520065839/http://latinbusinesschronicle.com/app/article.aspx?id=4789|archivedate=20 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports indicate that on 14 January 2011, a report from staff members of [[FUNAI]], Fundação Nacional do Índio, (National Indian Foundation) had sent a report to IBAMA expressing concerns about the location of the project, its impact on reservation land, and the lack of attention to needs of the indigenous people, especially the Paquiçamba and recommending that FUNAI oppose any license to operate.

On 25 February 2011, the Federal Public Prosecutor filed its 11th lawsuit against Belo Monte Dam, suspending IBAMA's partial installation license, on the grounds that the Brazilian Constitution does not allow for the granting of partial project licenses.

===Power generation and distribution===
{{anchor|Belo Monte Dam#Inefficiency}}
The planned capacity of Belo Monte is listed at 11,233&amp;nbsp;MW. It is composed of the main Belo Monte Dam, and its [[Turbine hall|turbine house]] with an installed capacity of 11,000&amp;nbsp;MW. The Pimental Dam which also includes a turbine house would have an installed capacity of 233.1&amp;nbsp;MW, containing 25.9&amp;nbsp;MW [[Kaplan turbine#Variations|bulb turbines]]. The generation facility is planned to have twenty&amp;nbsp;[[Francis turbine]]s with a capacity of 550–611&amp;nbsp;MW each.&lt;ref name="urlhydroworld-2011-0209"&gt;

===Capacity===
Walter Coronado Antunes, the former Secretary of the Environment of the state of São Paulo, and ex-President of the state water and sanitation utility [[Sabesp]], has said that the Belo Monte Dam Complex would be one of the least efficient hydro-power projects in the history of Brazil, producing only 10% of its 11,233&amp;nbsp;MW nameplate capacity between July and October (1,123&amp;nbsp;MW, and an average of only 4,419&amp;nbsp;MW throughout the year, or a 39% [[capacity factor]]).&lt;ref name=antunes&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the president of Brazil's Energy Research Company (EPE), 39% is "just a little below" Brazil's average of 55%. Normally, the capacity factor of hydroelectric power plants is between 30% and 80%, while [[wind power]] is typically between 20% and 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wind Power: Capacity Factor, Intermittency, and what happens when the wind doesn’t blow? |url=http://www.ceere.org/rerl/about_wind/RERL_Fact_Sheet_2a_Capacity_Factor.pdf |publisher=Renewable Energy Research Laboratory |accessdate=9 March 2011 |location=University of Massachusetts at Amhers |page=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001205145/http://www.ceere.org/rerl/about_wind/RERL_Fact_Sheet_2a_Capacity_Factor.pdf |archivedate=1 October 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study by Eletrobras, even when at reduced capacities, Belo Monte would still have the capacity to supply the entire state of Para with electricity.&lt;ref name=LBC/&gt;

===Availability===
Critics claim that the project would only make financial sense if the Brazilian government builds additional dam reservoirs upstream to guarantee a year-round flow of water, thus increasing the [[Availability factor|availability]] of generation. Supporters of the project point out that the seasonal minimum flow of the Xingu river occurs at a time when other Brazilian hydro plants are well supplied,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} so that no additional dams would have to be built. Reportedly, Brazil's National Council for Power Policies approved a resolution, previously sanctioned by then president Lula, that only one hydroelectric dam would be built on the Xingu. With one dam, critics don't see an advantage regarding the dam's cost-to-benefit ratio and question why the government would just want to construct one.&lt;ref name=small&gt;{{cite news|title=Brazilian government claims only a 'small minority' oppose Belo Monte dam|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/18/brazil-belo-monte-dam|publisher=Guardian UK|accessdate=9 March 2011|location=London|date=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional upstream dams would directly and indirectly affect 25,000 indigenous peoples in the entire Xingu basin. Of particular note is the Altamira (Babaquara) Dam, which would flood an additional {{convert|6140|km2|sqmi}} of reservoir, according to its original design.&lt;ref name=csf&gt;{{Cite web | publisher=Conservation Strategy Fund |url= http://conservation-strategy.org/en/brazil/belomonte | title = Belo Monte Dam (Brazil : 2004-2006) | accessdate=13 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developer==
The project is developed by Norte Energia. The consortium is controlled by the state-owned power company [[Eletrobras]], which directly (15%) and through its subsidiaries Eletronorte (19.98%) and [[CHESF]] (15%) controls a 49.98% stake in the consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Economics==
{{anchor|Project finance}}
The dam complex is expected to cost upwards of $16&amp;nbsp;billion and the transmission lines $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion. The project is being developed by the state-owned power company [[Eletronorte]], and would be funded largely by the [[Brazilian Development Bank]] (BNDES).&lt;ref name=aw&gt;{{Cite web | publisher=Amazon Watch |url= http://www.amazonwatch.org/amazon/BR/bmd/ | title = Belo Monte Dam | accessdate=13 May 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070607094832/http://www.amazonwatch.org/amazon/BR/bmd/| archivedate= 7 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project will also include substantial amounts of funding from Brazilian pension funds Petros, Previ, and Funcef. Private investors interested in the project include mining giants [[Alcoa]] and [[Vale do Rio Doce|Vale]], construction conglomerates [[Andrade Gutierrez]], Votorantim, Grupo OAS, Queiroz Galvão, [[Odebrecht]] and [[Camargo Corrêa]], and energy companies [[GDF Suez]] and Neoenergia.

In 2006, Conservation Strategy Fund (CSF) analyzed different cost-benefit scenarios for Belo Monte as an energy project, excluding environmental costs. Initial benefits appeared marginal. When simulating energy benefits using a modeling system it became obvious that Belo Monte would require additional upstream dams to provide water storage for dry season generation. CSF concluded that Belo Monte would not be sustainable without the proposed Altamira (Babaquara) dam which would have a reservoir more than 10 times the size of Belo Monte's, flood 30 times the area submerged by Belo Monte, [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous territories]] of the [[Araweté]]/Igarapé Ipixuna, [[Koatinemo]], [[Kayapo|Arara]], [[Kararaô]], and [[Cachoeira Seca do Irirí]] natives.&lt;ref name="urlBelo Monte Dam-CSF"&gt;{{Cite web

Due to the project's lack of economic viability and lack of interest from private investors, the government has had to rely on pension funds and lines of credit from BNDES that draw from the [[:pt:Fundo de Amparo ao Trabalhador|Workers' Assistance Fund]], oriented towards paying the public debt, to finance the project; up to one-third of the project's official cost would be financed by incentives using public money.&lt;ref&gt;"Incentivos federais chegam a 1/3 do valor de Belo Monte," {{cite web |url=http://economia.terra.com.br/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=201004200945_RED_78907085 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706154528/http://economia.terra.com.br/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=201004200945_RED_78907085 |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives===
[[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF-Brazil]] released a report in 2007 stating that Brazil could cut its expected demand for electricity by 40% by 2020 by investing in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. The power saved would be equivalent to 14 Belo Monte hydroelectric plants and would result in national electricity savings of up to R$33&amp;nbsp;billion (US$19&amp;nbsp;billion).&lt;ref&gt;To download the report, see WWF-Brazil and Greenpeace, http://www.climatesolver.org/source.php?id=1252339{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ex-director of ANEEL Afonso Henriques Moreira Santos stated that large dams such as Belo Monte were not necessary to meet the government's goal of 6% growth per year. Rather, he argued that Brazil could grow through increasing its installed capacity in [[wind power]], currently only at 400 MW.&lt;ref&gt;Governo criará "monstro", diz ex-diretor da Aneel http://clippingmp.planejamento.gov.br/cadastros/noticias/2010/4/24/governo-criara-monstro-diz-ex-diretor-da-aneel{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a study by the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]], published in June 2011, criticised some of these alternative suggestions and defended the Belo Monte dam project. They state that compared to the estimated costs of alternative energies, the Belo Monte dam is cheaper both in economic and in socio-environmental costs.&lt;ref&gt;de Castro, Nivalde J., da Silva Leite, André L., and de A.

The environmental impact assessment written by Eletrobras, Odebrecht, Camargo Corrêa, and Andrade Gutierrez listed the following possible adverse effects

* The loss of vegetation and natural spaces, with changes in fauna and flora;
* Changes in the quality and path of the water supply, and fish migration routes;
* Temporary disruption of the water supply in the Xingu riverbed for 7 months; 

===Incomplete environmental assessment===
In February 2010, Brazilian environmental agency IBAMA granted an environmental license for the construction of the dam despite uproar from within the agency about incomplete information in the [[Environmental Impact Assessment]] (EIA) written by Eletrobras, Odebrecht, Camargo Corrêa, and Andrade Gutierrez.&lt;ref name=csf2&gt;{{Cite news | publisher=BBC |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8492577.stm | title = Brazil grants environmental licence for Belo Monte dam | accessdate=2 February 2010 | date=2 February 2010 | first=Gary | last=Duffy| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100202023432/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8492577.stm| archivedate= 2 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously in October 2009, a panel composed of independent experts and specialists from Brazilian universities and research institutes issued a report on the EIA, finding "various omissions and methodological inconsistencies in the EIA..." Among the problems cited within the EIA were the project's uncertain cost, deforestation, generation capacity, greenhouse gas emissions and in particular the omission of consideration for those affected by the river being mostly diverted in the {{Convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} long "Big Bend" (Volta Grande).&lt;ref name=rainfoun/&gt;

Two senior officials at IBAMA, Leozildo Tabajara da Silva Benjamin and Sebastião Custódio Pires, resigned their posts in 2009 citing high-level political pressure to approve the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huntingtonnews.net/columns/100311-sommer-columnsbrazil.html |title=Shame on Brazil: Stop the Amazon Mega-Dam Project Belo Monte |publisher=[[The Huntington News|Huntington News]] Network |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, IBAMA president Abelardo Azevedo also resigned his post. The previous president Roberto Messias had also stepped down, citing in April 2010 that it was because of pressure from both the government and environmental organizations.&lt;ref name=LBC/&gt;

140 organizations and movements from Brazil and across the globe decried the decision-making process in granting the environmental license for the dams in a letter to Brazilian President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/Appeal_letter_English.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of biodiversity===
[[File:Hypancistrus zebra4305.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Hypancistrus zebra]]'', one of the species found only in the Volta Grande.]]
The fish fauna of the Xingu river is extremely rich with an estimated 600 fish species and with a high degree of [[endemism]].&lt;ref&gt;Camargo M., GiarrizzoT. &amp; Isaac V. (2004). "Review of the geographic distribution of fish fauna of the Xingu river basin, Brazil". ''[[Ecotropica]]'' '''10''': 123-147. [http://www.gtoe.de/public_html/publications/pdf/10-2/Camargo,Giarizzo,Isaac%202004.pdf PDF].&lt;/ref&gt; The area either dried out or drowned by the dam spans the entire known world distribution of a number of species, e.g. the zebra pleco (''[[Hypancistrus zebra]]''), the sunshine pleco (''[[Scobinancistrus]] aureatus''), the slender dwarf pike cichlid (''[[Teleocichla]] centisquama''), the killifish ''[[Anablepsoides]] xinguensis'' and ''[[Spectrolebias]] reticulatus'', and the Xingu dart-poison frog (''[[Allobates crombiei]]''). An independent expert review of the costs of the dam concluded that the proposed flow through the Volta Grande meant the river "will not be capable of maintaining species diversity", risking "extinction of hundreds of species".&lt;ref name="ipanel"/&gt;

===Greenhouse gas budget===
The [[National Institute of Amazonian Research|National Amazon Research Institute]] (INPA) calculated that during its first 10&amp;nbsp;years, the Belo Monte-Babaquara dam complex would emit 11.2&amp;nbsp;million [[tonne|metric tons]] of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent]], and an additional 0.783&amp;nbsp;million metric tons of {{chem|CO|2}} equivalent would be generated during construction and connection to the national energy grid.&lt;ref name=UFPA&gt;[http://www.periodicos.ufpa.br/index.php/ncn/article/view/315/501 Periódicos UFPA]&lt;/ref&gt; This independent study estimates greenhouse gas emissions of an amount that would require 41 years of optimal energy production from the Belo Monte Dam complex (including the now aborted Altamira Dam) in order to reach environmental sustainability over fossil fuel energy.&lt;ref name=UFPA/&gt;

Dams in Brazil emit high amounts of methane, due to the lush jungle covered by waters each year as the basin fills. Carbon is trapped by foliage, which then decays anaerobically with help from [[methanogens]], converting the carbon to methane, which is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. As a result, carbon emissions are emitted from the dam each year it is in operation. A 1990 study of the [[Curuá-Una Dam]], also in Brazil, found that it pollutes 3.5 times more in carbon dioxide equivalent than an oil power plant generating an equal amount of electricity would;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7046 Hydroelectric Power's Dirty Secret Revealed]&lt;/ref&gt; not in the form of the CO2 atmospheric pollution associated with fossil fuel burning, but as the more dangerous methane emissions. Furthermore, the forest will be cleared before flooding of the area, so the CO2 and methane emissions calculated for the flooding of the forested area will be significantly undercut.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} In addition, a study on the Brazilian [[Tucuruí dam]] showed that the actual greenhouse gas emissions were a factor ten higher than its official calculations showed, and this dam is no exception; it is feared that the Belo Monte Dam calculations are also deliberately undercutting reality and that the flooding of its [[reservoir]] will create a similar situation.&lt;ref&gt;Fearnside, Phillip M.

Retrieved 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; If the dam builders cleared the forest beforehand, they would remove the organic matter from the reservoir floor and the dam would produce less of the greenhouse gas methane. However, in the case of [[Tucuruí dam|Tucuruí]], only the economically necessary forest was cut (10%, near the opening to the spillway) and the rest was left intact to be flooded by the reservoir. The contractors had sold the logging rights to the flooded area, but found the plot unviable in the short amount of time they had allocated before the area was set to be flooded. This forest has been decaying under the water through [[Methanogenesis]] and producing large amounts of greenhouse gases.

On the other hand, the energy generated by the dam for the next 50&amp;nbsp;years, at an average of 4419 MW, is 1.14 bboe (billion barrels of oil equivalent){{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}. This is approximately 9% of the proven oil reserves of Brazil (12.6 bbl&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Social effects==
[[Image:Greenpeacebelomonte.jpg|thumb|Protestors against the dam. The sign translates to "Beautiful pile of shit".]]
Although strongly criticized by indigenous leaders, the president of Brazil's EPE claims they have popular support for the dam. On 20 April 2010 ''Folha de Sao Paulo'' poll showed 52% in favor of the dam.&lt;ref name=LBC/&gt;&lt;ref name="reutersOK"/&gt;&lt;ref name=small/&gt; The dam will directly displace over 20,000 people, mainly from the municipalities of [[Altamira, Brazil|Altamira]] and [[Vitória do Xingu]].&lt;ref name=aljaz&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: Battles over Brazil's biggest dam|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/01/201212011183675441.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=5 March 2014|date=20 January 2012|first=Gabriel|last=Elizondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two river diversion canals {{convert|500|m|ft}} wide by {{convert|12|km|mi}} long will be excavated. The canals would divert water from the main dam to the power plant. Belo Monte will flood a total area of {{convert|668|km2|sqmi}}. Of the total, {{convert|400|km2|sqmi}} of flooded area will be forested land.&lt;ref name="aneel.gov.br"/&gt;  The river diversion canals will reduce river flow by 80% in the area known as the Volta Grande ("Big Bend"), where the territories of the indigenous [[Juruna]] and Arara people, as well as those of sixteen other [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|ethnic groups]] are located.&lt;ref name=rainfoun/&gt; While these tribes will not be directly impacted by reservoir flooding, and therefore will not be relocated, they may suffer involuntary displacement, as the river diversion negatively affects their fisheries, groundwater, ability to transport on the river and stagnant pools of water offer an environment for water-borne diseases, an issue that is criticized for not being addressed in the Environmental Impact Assessment.&lt;ref name=rainfoun&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary and History of the Belo Monte Dam: Rainforest Foundation|url=http://www.rainforestfoundationuk.org/files/Belo%20Monte%20Factsheet.pdf|publisher=Summary and History of the Belo Monte Dam: Rainforest Foundation|accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the 20,000 to be directly displaced by reservoir flooding, resettlement programs have been identified by the government as necessary for mitigation. Norte Energia have failed to obtain free, prior, and informed consent from the Juruna and Arara indigenous tribes to be impacted by Belo Monte.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unsr.jamesanaya.org/PDFs/Communications%20report-FINAL.pdf|title=Report of UN Special Rapporteur James Anaya &amp;#124; James Anaya|author=|authorlink=|date=|format=|work=|publisher=|pages=|language=|quote=|accessdate=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project would also attract an estimated 100,000 migrants to the area.&lt;ref name=rainfoun/&gt; An estimated 18,700 direct jobs would be created, with an additional 25,000 indirect jobs to accommodate the surge in population.&lt;ref name=LBC/&gt; However, only a fraction of the direct jobs will stay available after the project's completion, which critics have argued to spell economic disaster rather than economic prosperity.&lt;ref name=LBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=rainfoun/&gt;

The influx of immigrants and construction workers has also led to increased social tension between groups. [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Indigenous Groups]] report attacks and harassment, and in several occasions the destruction of property and the death of indigenous persons as a result from constructing and ([[Illegal Logging|illegal]]) logging activities.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Tom (15 February 2012).

(in Portuguese) Retrieved 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; External researchers indicate that the majority of the Belo Monte dam's energy output will be relegated towards the [[aluminium]] industry, and will not benefit the people living in the area.&lt;ref name="Fearnside"/&gt; However, Norte Energia released a clarification note stating their concern with the socioeconomic development of the area, including the promise to invest R$3.700 billion (1,300 million GBP) into various issues.&lt;ref&gt;Norte Energia S.A. (14 September 2011). "Clarification note: The Guardian" (http://en.norteenergiasa.com.br/2011/09/14/clarification-note-the-guardian/). Retrieved 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===IBAMA report===
The IBAMA's environmental impact assessment has listed the following possible impacts:

* The generation of expectations towards the future of the local population and indigenous people;
* An increase in population and uncontrolled land occupation;
* An increase in the needs of services and goods, as well as job demand;
* A loss of housing and economic activities due to the transfer of population;
* Improvements on the accessibility of the region;
* Changes in the landscape, caused by the installation of support and main structures for the construction of the dam;
* Damage to the archaeological estates in the area;
* Permanent flooding of shelters in Gravura Assurini;

However, a clarification was released by the Brazilian authorities, in which it was deemed that the assured social and economic benefits, considered for the environmental redesign and the region's infrastructural developments, would outweigh the expected environmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;IBAMA (1 June 2011). "Ibama autoriza a instalação da Usina de Belo Monte" (http://www.ibama.gov.br/publicadas/ibama-autoriza-a-instalacao-da-usina-de-belo-monte). (in Portuguese) Retrieved 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the beginning of the project many environmental and human rights organizations have been protesting against the construction of the Belo Monte Dam. On the 14th of August 2012 the Brazil Federal Court halted the construction of the Belo Monte Dam on the basis that the government's authorization of the dam was unconstitutional. The government didn't hold constitutionally required meetings with indigenous communities affected by the dam before granting permission in 2005 to start with the construction.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.adr.com/Markets/GlobalNewsStory?docID=1-DN20120814014717-57SEVI63PIL6SFS1R9IDQSVOO7{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is against the Brazilian law and international human rights. However, Norte Energía, the company assigned with the construction of the Belo Monte Dam, has the possibility of an appeal to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/16/belo-monte-dam-construction-suspended?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jonathan | last=Watts | title=Belo Monte dam construction halted by Brazilian court | date=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights concerns===
The attitude and treatment of the Brazilian government towards the affected indigenous groups is strongly criticised internationally. The [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] has published statements denouncing Brazil's careless construction methods,&lt;ref&gt;Instituto Raoni (13 March 2012). "Violações dos direitos indigenas: o Conselho de Direitos Humanos da ONU Publica nossa declaração" (http://raoni.com/atualidade-298.php). (in Portuguese). Retrieved 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) likewise pointed out that the Brazilian state was in violation of ILO conventions (particularly the [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989]] No 169)&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Organization (27 June 1989). "C169 Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989" (http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C169{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}). Retrieved 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; – although mechanisms for international enforcement are lacking, and it would require a Brazilian court to apply the binding principles of the convention, which Brazil has ratified. Indigenous groups have questioned the government's actions over these events,&lt;ref&gt;Instituto Raoni (22 March 2012). "Carta aberta à Presidenta Dilma e à sociedade brasileira" (http://www.raoni.com/atualidade-307.php). (in Portuguese), Retrieved 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but their situation remains ignored by the authorities, as shown with the May 2011 Xingu Mission report of the CDDPH (Conselho de Defesa dos Direitos da Pessoa Humana),&lt;ref&gt;Conselho de Defesa dos Direitos da Pessoa Humana (24 May 2011). "Relatório de impressões sobre as violações dos direitos humanos na região conhecida como "Terra do Meio" no Estado do Pará" (http://www.xinguvivo.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Relat%C3%B3rio-CDDPH.pdf). (In Portuguese) (PDF) Retrieved 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; of which several sections regarding accusations of human right violations were excluded by the [[Special Secretariat for Human Rights|Special Secretary for Human Rights]], [[Maria do Rosário|Maria do Rosário Nunes]].&lt;ref&gt;Glass, Verena (25 March 2012).

'''''Blowing Wild''''' is a 1953 American [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Hugo Fregonese]] and starring [[Gary Cooper]], [[Barbara Stanwyck]] and [[Anthony Quinn]]. It was written by [[Philip Yordan]]. The story revolves around a [[love triangle]] set in [[Mexico]]'s oilfields, where bandits are still active. [[Ruth Roman]] also stars and adds to the romantic entanglements.

[[Frankie Laine]] sang the title song, "Blowing Wild (The Ballad of Black Gold)", which was written by [[Dmitri Tiomkin]], with lyrics by [[Paul Francis Webster]].

==Plot==
After the bandit El Gavilan and his men blow up their South American oil rig, broke [[wildcatter]]s Jeff Dawson and "Dutch" Peterson head back to town, looking for work. Sal Donnelly, an American down on her luck, tries to use her charms to get Jeff to buy her a ticket to get home; Jeff offers his oil lease as payment, but the ticket taker shows him a fistful of leases he already has.

Jeff accepts a very dangerous job delivering unstable [[nitroglycerin]] the next day for $800, despite Dutch's protests. That night, Dutch tries to mug a man for enough money to buy a meal. The man turns out to be "Paco" Conway, an old friend and former partner of Jeff and Dutch, who has struck it rich. He offers them work, but his marriage to Jeff's old flame Marina makes Jeff turn it down. The next day, Jeff and Dutch (and the nitroglycerin) are ambushed by El Gavilan. They get away, though Dutch is shot in the leg.

When Jeff goes to collect their pay, Jackson claims he does not that much on him. Sal, whom Jackson is romancing, tells Jeff that Jackson has $2500 in his wallet. Jeff gets his money, after a brawl, and gives $200 to Sal for her ticket. However, a policeman confiscates Jeff's $600, as Jackson has other creditors, though he is gracious enough to leave Sal her money. With Dutch in the hospital, Jeff reluctantly goes to work for Paco, drilling a new oil well.

Marina makes romantic overtures to Jeff, but he avoids her as best he can. He reminds her that he loved her once, but could not trust her. She admits it, but says she realized she loved him too after he had left. Paco remains oblivious to what is going on. To Jeff's initial annoyance, Sal gets a job as a blackjack dealer and sticks around. Later though, he starts going into town to see her.

When El Gavilan threatens to blow up Paco's oil wells unless he pays $50,000 extortion money, Paco considers paying, much to Jeff's disgust. Marina sides with Jeff, calling her husband a coward. A drunken Paco later laments publicly that his wife loves another man. He finally realizes the other man is Jeff. When Paco tells her that he loves her regardless, Marina pushes him into a well, where the machinery kills him. Marina claims that Paco fell in by accident. When she lets slip to Jeff that she killed Paco so they could be together, he nearly strangles her, then regains control of himself and leaves the house. Just then, the bandits attack. The local police and Jeff fight them. Marina is irresistibly drawn to the fatal oil well during the battle, and dies when it is blown up. Jeff kills El Gavilan, then leaves with Dutch and Sal.

== History ==
In 1984, Camlin Fine Chemicals Division was started by [[Kokuyo Camlin|Camlin]] with the setting up of a new ultra modern plant at Tarapur, India. 

In 2006, Camlin Fine Chemicals demerged from the parent company and an entirely new entity formed called 'Camlin Fine Sciences Ltd.

In 2007, CFS was listed on the [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.camlinfs.com/journey.php|title=Camlin Fine Sciences - High quality shelf life extension solutions|website=www.camlinfs.com|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, CFS got listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

In 2011, CFS took the first overseas with the acquisition of Borregaard Italia SpA, a Hydroquinone and Catechol manufacturing facility at Ravenna, Italy through its wholly owned subsidiary in Mauritius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/camlin-fine-chemicals-buys-italyrsquos-borregaard/article23050272.ece|title=Camlin Fine Chemicals buys Italy’s Borregaard|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, CFS began operations in Brasil through its 100% subsidiary company CFS do Brasil Ltd, where it commenced production of antioxidant blends for food applications.

In 2016, CFS acquired 65 % stake in Dresen Quimica S.A.P.I.de C.V., Mexico along with its group companies and subsidiaries.

In July 2017, CFS became the 3rd largest producer of vanillin in the world with the acquisition of 51% stake in Ningbo Wanglong Flavors &amp; Fragrances Company Ltd., China. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/camlin-fine-sciences-buys-51-stake-in-chinese-firm-117071201360_1.html|title=Camlin Fine Sciences buys 51% stake in Chinese firm|first=Press Trust of|last=India|date=12 July 2017|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2018|via=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chaco National Park''' ({{lang-es|Parque Nacional Chaco}}) is a [[national park]] of [[Argentina]], located in the [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Chaco Province|Chaco]]. It has an area of 150&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It was created in 1954 in order to protect a sample of the Eastern Chaco, composed mainly of warm lowlands, with an annual summer rainfall between 750 and 1,300&amp;nbsp;mm.

This park is a protected area for the [[quebracho tree]]s. Forests of ''quebracho colorado chaqueño'' (''[[Schinopsis balansae]]'') were once located in the north of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] and the western half of Chaco, and had entered the northeast region of the province of [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]]. Its strong wood and its abundant [[tannin]] caused it to be [[over-exploited]] for a century.

The area harbors several environments: [[scrubland]], [[savanna]], [[swamp]]s, and small lakes. The scrubland is the habitat of the red quebracho (''[[Schinopsis lorentzii]]''), white quebracho (''[[Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco]]''),  algarrobo (''[[Prosopis alba]]''), and lapacho (''[[Tabebuia]]'' spp.),  all of which are commercially valuable species. The fauna includes large predators such as [[cougar]]s. In the lakes one finds [[yacare caiman]]s and [[capybara]]s. Elsewhere there are [[armadillo]]s, [[South American tapir]]s and [[plains viscacha]]s, as well as birds (more than 340 species). The fauna also includes the black howler monkey (''[[black howler|Alouatta caraya]]'').

Indigenous communities of the [[Mocoví people|Mocoví]] and [[Toba (tribe)|Toba]] peoples are found in the protected area.

In [[architecture]] and [[Woodworking joints|joinery]], the '''chambranle''' is the border, frame, or ornament, made of [[Masonry|stone]] or [[wood]], that is a component of the three sides round chamber doors, large windows, and chimneys.

When a chambranle is plain and without mouldings, it is called a ''band'', ''case'', or ''frame''. The chambranle consists of three parts; the two sides, called ''montants'', or ''ports'', and the top, called the ''traverse'' or ''supercilium''. The chambranle of an ordinary door is frequently called a ''door-case''; of a window, ''window-frame''; and of a chimney, ''mantle-tree''.

==History==
{{wiktionary|antepagmenta}}
In ancient architecture, ''antepagmenta'' were garnishings in posts or [[door]]s, wrought in stone or timber, or [[lintel (architecture)|lintel]]s of a [[window]].  The word comes from Latin and has been borrowed in English to be used for the entire chambranle, i.e. the door case, or window frame.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14298">'''Cold hardening''' is the [[physiological]] and [[biochemical]] process by which an organism prepares for cold weather.

==Plants==
[[File:Ice Storm 2013, Guelph 06.jpg|thumb|Plant covered in snow after an ice storm in 2013, Ontario, Canada]]

Cold hardening is a process in which a plant undergoes physiological changes to avoid, or mitigate [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] injuries caused by sub-zero temperatures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Non-acclimatized individuals can survive −5&amp;nbsp;°C, while an acclimatized individual in the same species can survive −30°. Plants that originated in the tropics, like [[tomato]] or [[maize]], don't go through cold hardening and are unable to survive freezing temperatures.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKhann|first=Heather I.|last2=Gery|first2=Carine|last3=Bérard|first3=Aurélie|last4=Lévêque|first4=Sylvie|last5=Zuther|first5=Ellen|last6=Hincha|first6=Dirk K.|last7=De Mita|first7=S.|last8=Brunel|first8=Dominique|last9=Téoulé|first9=Evelyne|date=2008-01-01|title=Natural variation in CBF gene sequence, gene expression and freezing tolerance in the Versailles core collection of Arabidopsis thaliana|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-8-105|journal=BMC Plant Biology|volume=8|pages=105|doi=10.1186/1471-2229-8-105|issn=1471-2229|pmc=2579297|pmid=18922165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant starts the [[Adaptation (biology)|adaptation]] by exposure to cold yet still not freezing temperatures. The process can be divided into three steps. First the plant perceives low temperature, then converts the [[Signal (biology)|signal]] to activate or repress [[Gene expression|expression]] of appropriate [[gene]]s. Finally, it uses these genes to combat the [[Stress (biology)|stress]], caused by sub-zero temperatures, affecting its living [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Many of the genes and responses to low temperature [[Stress (biology)|stress]] are shared with other [[abiotic stress]]es, like drought or salinity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[Image:Plant cell structure-en.svg|thumb|200px|Schematic of typical plant cell]]When temperature drops, the [[Cell membrane|membrane]] fluidity, [[RNA]] and [[DNA]] stability, and [[enzyme]] activity change. These, in turn, affect [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]], [[Translation (biology)|translation]], [[Metabolism|intermediate metabolism]], and [[photosynthesis]], leading to an energy imbalance. This energy imbalance is thought to be one of the ways the plant detects low temperature. Experiments on ''[[arabidopsis]]'' show that the plant detects the change in temperature, rather than the [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The rate of temperature drop is directly connected to the magnitude of [[calcium]] influx, from the space between cells, into the cell. [[Calcium channel]]s in the [[cell membrane]] detect the temperature drop, and promotes expression of low temperature responsible genes in ''[[alfalfa]]'' and ''[[arabidopsis]]''. The response to the change in [[calcium]] elevation depends on the cell type and [[Stress (biology)|stress]] history. [[Shoot]] tissue will respond more than a [[root]] cells, and a cell that already is [[Adaptation|adapted]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;to [[Hypothermia|cold stress]] will respond more than one that has not been through cold hardening before. Light doesn't control the onset of cold hardening directly, but shortening of daylight is associated with fall, and starts production of [[reactive oxygen species]] and excitation of [[Photosystem II|photosystem 2]], which influences low-temp [[signal transduction]] mechanisms. Plants with compromised perception of day length have compromised cold acclimation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Cold increases [[Cell permeability|cell membrane permeability]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=itB5yKv7-rIC|title=Plants in Agriculture|last=Forbes|first=James C.|last2=Watson|first2=Drennan|date=1992-08-20|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521427913|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and makes the cell shrink, as water is drawn out when ice is formed in the [[extracellular matrix]] between cells.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To retain the [[surface area]] of the [[cell membrane]] so it will be able to regain its former [[volume]] when temperature rises again, the plant forms more and stronger [[Hechtian strand]]s. These are tubelike structures that connect the [[protoplast]] with the cell wall. When the [[intracellular]] water freezes, the cell will expand, and without cold hardening the cell would rupture. To protect the cell membrane from expansion induced damage, the plant cell changes the proportions of almost all [[lipid]]s in the cell membrane, and increases the amount of total soluble [[protein]] and other cryoprotecting molecules, like sugar and [[proline]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Chilling injury occurs at 0–10 degrees Celsius, as a result of membrane damage, metabolic changes, and toxic buildup. Symptoms include wilting, water soaking, [[necrosis]], [[chlorosis]], ion leakage, and decreased growth. Freezing injury may occur at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius. Symptoms of extracellular freezing include structural damage, dehydration, and necrosis. If intracellular freezing occurs, it will lead to death. Freezing injury is a result of lost permeability, plasmolysis, and post-thaw cell bursting.

When spring comes, or during a mild spell in winter, plants de-harden, and if the temperature is warm for long enough – their growth resumes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Insects==
Cold hardening has also been observed in [[insect]]s such as the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] and [[diamondback moth]]. The insects use rapid cold hardening to protect against [[cold shock]] during overwintering periods.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A rapid cold-hardening process in insects|last=Chen|first=CP|last2=Denlinger|first2=DL|journal=Science|last3=Lee|first3=RE|pmid=17800568|doi=10.1126/science.238.4832.1415|volume=238|issue=4832|pages=1415–7|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A rapid cold-hardening response protecting against cold shock injury in Drosophila melanogaster|last=Lee|first=RE|last2=Czajka|first2=MC|publisher=Science|pmid=2106564|volume=148|journal=J Exp Biol|pages=245–54|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Overwintering]] insects stay awake and active through the winter while non-overwintering insects [[Insect migration|migrate]] or die. Rapid cold hardening can be experienced during short periods of undesirable temperatures, such as [[Cold shock response|cold shock]] in environment temperature, as well as the common cold months. The buildup of [[Cryoprotectant|cryoprotective]] compounds is the reason that insects can experience cold hardening.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Glycerol]] is a cryoprotective substance found within these insects capable of overwintering. Through testing, glycerol requires interactions with other [[cell components]] within the insect in order to decrease the body's permeability to the cold.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When an insect is exposed to these cold temperatures, glycerol rapidly accumulates. Glycerol is known as a [[non-ionic]] [[Kosmotropic|kosmotrope]] forming powerful [[hydrogen bond]]s with [[water molecule]]s. The hydrogen bonds in the glycerol compound compete with the weaker bonds between the water molecules causing an interruption in the makeup of ice formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duman | first1 = J | year = 2002 | title = The inhibition of ice nucleators by insect antifreeze proteins is enhanced by glycerol and citrate | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00360-001-0239-7 | journal = Journal of Comparative Physiology B | volume = 172 | issue = 2| pages = 163–168 | doi = 10.1007/s00360-001-0239-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This chemistry found within the glycerol compound and reaction between water has been used as an [[antifreeze]] in the past, and can be seen here when concerning cold hardening. Proteins also play a large role in the cryoprotective compounds that increase ability to survive the cold hardening process and environmental change. [[Glycogen phosphorylase]] (GlyP) has been a key protein found during testing to increase in comparison to a controlled group not experiencing the cold hardening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Overgaard | first1 = J. | last2 = Sørensen | first2 = J. G. | last3 = Com | first3 = E. | last4 = Colinet | first4 = H. | year = 2013 | title = The rapid cold hardening response of Drosophila melanogaster: Complex regulation across different levels of biological organization | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022191014000109 | journal = Journal of Insect Physiology | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 46–53 | doi=10.1016/j.jinsphys.2014.01.009| pmid = 24508557 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once warmer temperatures are observed the process of [[acclimation]] begins, and the increased glycerol along with other cryoprotective compounds and proteins are also reversed. There is a rapid cold hardening capacity found within certain insects that suggests not all insects can survive a long period of overwintering. Non-[[Diapause|diapausing]] insects can sustain brief temperature shocks but often have a limit to which they can handle before the body can no longer produce enough cryoprotective components.
&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[File:Saving the planet one fruit fly at a time - part 1 (7353498896).jpg|thumb|The common fruit fly]]
Inclusive to the cold hardening process being beneficial for insects survival during cold temperatures, it also helps improve the [[organism]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s performance.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = R. E. | last2 = Damodaran | first2 = K. | last3 = Yi | first3 = S. X. | last4 = Lorigan | first4 = G.

The ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' (common fruit fly) is a frequently experimented insect involving cold hardening. A proven example of RCH enhancing organisms performance comes from courting and mating within the fruit fly. It has been tested that the fruit fly mated more frequently once RCH has commenced in relation to a controlled insect group not experiencing RCH.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Most insects experiencing extended cold periods are observed to modify the [[membrane lipids]] within the body. Desaturation of [[fatty acid]]s are the most commonly seen modification to the [[membrane]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; When the fruit fly was observed under the stressful climate the survival rate increased in comparison to the fly prior to cold hardening.
[[File:Plutella.xylostella.7383.jpg|thumb|The diamondback moth]]
In addition to testing on the common fruit fly, ''[[Diamondback moth|Plutella xylostella]]'' (diamondback moth) also has been widely studied for its significance in cold hardening. While this insect also shows an increase in glycerol and similar cryoprotective compounds, it also shows an increase in [[polyol]]s. These compounds are specifically linked to cryoprotective compounds designed to withstand cold hardening. The polyol compound is freeze-susceptible and [[Freeze tolerance|freeze tolerant]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Park | first1 = Y. | last2 = Kim | first2 = Y. | year = 2014 | title = A specific glycerol kinase induces rapid cold hardening of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022191014001255 | journal = Journal of Insect Physiology | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 56–63 | doi=10.1016/j.jinsphys.2014.06.010| pmid = 24973793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyols simply act as a barrier within the insect body by preventing [[intracellular]] freezing by restricting the [[extracellular]] freezing likely to happen in overwintering periods.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; During the larvae stage of the diamondback moth, the significance of glycerol was tested again for validity. The lab injected the larvae with added glycerol and in turn proved that glycerol is a major factor in survival rate when cold hardening. The cold tolerance is directly proportional to the buildup of glycerol during cold hardening.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Cold hardening of insects improves the survival rate of the species and improves function. Once environmental temperature begins to warm up above freezing, the cold hardening process is reversed and the glycerol and cryprotective compounds decrease within the body. This also reverts the function of the insect to pre-cold hardening activity.

The '''Daryan Dam''', also spelled '''Darian''', is an [[embankment dam]] constructed on the [[Sirvan River]] just north of [[Daryan, Kermanshah|Daryan]] in [[Paveh County]], [[Kermanshah Province]], Iran. The primary purpose of the dam is to supply up to {{Convert|1378000000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} of water annually to the {{Convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} long Nosoud Water Conveyance Tunnel where it will irrigate areas of Southwestern Iran. The dam will also have a 210 MW [[hydroelectric]] power station. Construction on the dam began in 2009 and the dam began to fill its reservoir in late November 2015. [[The Darian Dam Archaeological Salvage Program]] (DDASP) was planned by Iranian Center for Archaeological Research before flooding the [[reservoir]]. As a result a number of important archaeological sites were discovered and some were excavated. The power station is expected to be operational at the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Darian city began Pave dam|url=http://www.irna.ir/fa/News/81850749/|accessdate=7 December 2015|language=Persian|date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All works are expected to be complete by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Darian Dam|url=http://daminfo.wrm.ir/fa/pageviewreport/1097#|publisher=Iran Water Resources Management|accessdate=17 May 2013|language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Tunnel Nosoud|url=http://www.jtma.ir/fa/projectlist/nonendconstuction/balarooddam|publisher=JTMA|accessdate=17 May 2013|language=Persian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123151541/http://www.jtma.ir/fa/projectlist/nonendconstuction/balarooddam#|archive-date=2013-01-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dam's diversion tunnel was completed in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diversion Tunnel for Darian Dam Open|url=http://khabarfarsi.com/n/777064/%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%86%D9%84_%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81_%D8%A2%D8%A8_%D8%B3%D8%AF_%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86_%D9%BE%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%87_%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AD_%D8%B4%D8%AF|publisher=Khaber Farsi|accessdate=17 May 2013|language=Persian|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dam was designed by Stucky of France and consultation was provided by Mahab Ghodss, International Consulting Engineering Co.

[[File:Frost_patterns_4.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Water vapor]] from humid winter-air deposits directly into a solid, crystalline frost pattern on a window, without ever being liquid in the process.]]

'''Deposition''' is a [[thermodynamic process]], a [[phase transition]] in which [[gas]] transforms into [[solid]] without passing through the [[liquid phase]]. The reverse of deposition is [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] and hence sometimes deposition is called '''desublimation'''.

One example of deposition is the [[Process (science)|process]] by which, in [[sub-freezing]] [[air]], [[water vapor]] changes directly to [[ice]] without first becoming a [[liquid]]. This is how [[snow]] forms in [[cloud]]s, as well as how [[frost]] and [[hoar frost]] form on the ground or other surfaces. Another example is when frost forms on a leaf. For deposition to occur, thermal energy must be removed from a gas. When the air becomes cold enough, water vapor in the air surrounding the leaf loses enough thermal energy to change into a solid. Even though the air temperature may be below the dew point, the water vapor may not be able to condense spontaneously if there is no way to remove the latent heat.  When the leaf is introduced, the supercooled water vapor immediately begins to condense, but by this point is already past the freezing point.  This causes the water vapor to change directly into a solid.

Another example is the [[soot]] that is deposited on the walls of chimneys. Soot molecules rise from the fire in a hot and gaseous state. When they come into contact with the walls they cool, and change to the solid state, without formation of the liquid state. The process is made use of industrially in [[combustion chemical vapor deposition]].

There is an industrial coatings process, known as [[evaporative deposition]], whereby a solid material is heated to the gaseous state in a low-pressure chamber, the gas molecules travel across the chamber space and then condense to the solid state on a target surface, forming a smooth and thin layer on the target surface. Again, the molecules do not go through an intermediate liquid state when going from the gas to the solid. See also [[physical vapor deposition]], which is a class of processes used to deposit [[thin films]] of various materials onto various surfaces.

Deposition releases energy and is an [[exothermic]] phase change.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2970">[[File:DeutschlandsenderIII.jpg|thumb|right|Mast in 1940]]The '''Deutschlandsender III''' was a 500 kilowatt [[longwave]] transmitter, erected in 1938/39 near [[Herzberg (Elster)|Herzberg]], [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] in [[Germany]]. Used for the ''[[Deutschlandsender]]'' radio broadcasts, the [[guyed mast]] reaching a height of {{convert|337|m|ft|abbr=off}} was the tallest construction in Europe and the second tallest in the world.

==Construction==
[[File:DeutschlandsenderIII Dach.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Mast head]]
The Deutschlandsender III used a {{convert|325|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall guyed steel lattice mast of triangular cross section. This was used as a [[mast radiator]] and was therefore mounted on a {{convert|0.75|m|ft|abbr=on}} high [[Soapstone|steatite]] insulator. At the top of the mast there was a lens-like [[electrical length]]ening structure with a diameter of {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a height of {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

Because the mast was under high voltage during transmission, the [[aircraft warning lights|aircraft warning lighting]] was realized in a very unconventional manner. On small poles near the mast multiple rotating searchlights were mounted which illuminated the lens-like structure on the top.

It was planned to expand the facility to a circle group antenna. Therefore, ten {{convert|275|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall masts should be built on a circle with a diameter of {{convert|1425|m|ft|abbr=on}} around the central mast. In 1944 construction of a backup antenna in form of a triangle antenna, carried by three {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall masts, forming a triangle with {{convert|210|m|ft|abbr=on}} sidelength, started on the location of the planned mast No. 9. This antenna could not be completed as a result of the war.

On 21 April 1945 the transmitter was severely damaged by Allied bombing. The mast remained unimpaired, but, it dismantled by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation troops, a task that lasted from July 1946 to 23 December 1947. The other parts of the facility were dismantled in 1959, when waterworks were built on the former station area. Nevertheless, there are still some remnants of the base visible at the location.

It is unknown what happened to the mast after it was dismantled. It is sometimes claimed that it was rebuilt in the Ukraine, as "Kiev" was scrawled on the containers the components were transported in.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3380">'''Energy rationing''' primarily involves measures that are designed to force [[energy conservation]] as an alternative to [[price mechanism]]s in [[energy market]]s. Because of its economic consequences energy rationing is used as method of last resort, often at times of emergency such as during an [[energy crisis]].

==Forms==
Examples of energy [[rationing]] include fuel rationing and the use of ration books or [[ration stamp]]s to restrict personal consumption. Energy rationing may include penalties such as [[fee|surcharges]] and disconnection from electrical supply for those who choose not to reduce their demand voluntarily. 

[[Load shedding]] is a common form of energy rationing used when [[electricity market]]s cannot keep up to demand, particularly [[peak demand]]. Limited electrical supply from [[power station]]s at times of drought or after [[infrastructure]] is damaged, can lead authorities to implement rationing. [[Electricity_sector_in_Brazil#The_2001-2002_crisis_and_the_government.E2.80.99s_response|Brazil was forced]] to implement energy rationing due to drought in 2001.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/may/28/business/fi-3531 |title=Brazil’s Energy Rationing Aims to Cut Usage by 20% |author=Andrei Khalip |accessdate=2008-01-24 |date=2001-05-28 |work= |publisher=[[LA Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing demand in this way aims to avoid forced [[power outage]]s which are more disruptive than rationing.&lt;ref name=lat /&gt;

[[Tradable Energy Quotas]] is an energy rationing system designed to enable nations to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases along with their use of oil, gas and coal, and to ensure fair access to energy for all.

==Issues==
{{main|Energy security}}
One issue with energy rationing is the cost of setting up a rationing schemes. Another criticism is that energy rationing schemes are unworkable and face many practical problems including consumer lawsuits.&lt;ref name=lat /&gt; Due to the general disdain for restrictions that interfere with existing personal freedoms, such as [[ecotax]]es and [[carbon rationing]], energy rationing is not favoured by policy makers to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/05/29/carbon_rationing_no/ |title=Are you ready for WW2-style energy rationing? |author=Andrew Orlowski  |accessdate=2008-01-24 |date=2008-05-29 |work= |publisher=[[The Register]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peak oil===
{{main|Mitigation of peak oil}}
As oil becomes more scarce due to [[oil depletion]] countries that have reserve currencies will prefer to buy oil rather than ration it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.321energy.com/editorials/price/price062908.html |title=Tribute Paid in Oil |accessdate=2008-06-30 |work=321energy.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oil Depletion Protocol]] is form of energy rationing that was developed by [[Richard Heinberg]] to ensure that price rationing does not price out poorer countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalpublicmedia.com/want_cheap_oil_reduce_demand |title=Want Cheap Oil?

The '''February 1952 nor'easter''' was a significant [[winter storm]] that impacted the [[New England]] region of the United States. The storm ranked as Category 1, or "notable", on the [[Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale]].&lt;ref name="Kocin2"&gt;Kocin and Uccellini, p. 659&lt;/ref&gt; Its rapid intensification resulted in heavy snowfall between February 17 and 18, accumulating to {{convert|12|to|30|in|cm}}. High winds also affected central and northern New England. The nor'easter is estimated to have caused 42 fatalities. In [[Maine]], over 1,000 travelers became stranded on roadways.&lt;ref name="Kocin3"&gt;Kocin and Uccellini, p. 660&lt;/ref&gt;  Two ships cracked in two offshore New England during the storm.

==Development==
The development of this [[extratropical cyclone]] was associated with a pronounced weakening of the usual zonal, or west-to-east, flow which dominates the Mid-Latitudes during the winter, with the [[jet stream]] dipping from the latitude of Boston to the latitude of Charleston, South Carolina.  The initial [[low-pressure area]] originated in the Gulf of Mexico, with a downstream redevelopment offshore Cape Hatteras on February 16.  The cyclone deepened rapidly, 25 millibars in 24 hours between February 17 and February 18, while moving just offshore Long Island and southern New England, and dropped heavy precipitation across the central and northern [[Mid-Atlantic states]].  The snowfall associated with the storm across eastern New York and southern [[New England]] produced the heaviest snows of the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Monthly Weather Review|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/080/mwr-080-02-0026.pdf|title=The Weather and Circulation of February 1952: A Month With a Pronounced Index Cycle|author=Jay S.

There was significant disruption to shipping due to this storm.  On February 18, 1952, while en route from [[New Orleans]] to [[Boston]], the [[T2 tanker]] SS Pendleton' broke in two in a [[nor'easter]] south of [[Cape Cod]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=VisserT2-SE-A1&gt;{{cite web |last1=Visser |first1=Auke |title=Pendleton |url=http://www.aukevisser.nl/t2tanker/id246.htm |website=Auke Visser's Famous T – Tankers Pages |publisher=Auke Visser |accessdate=September 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[United States Coast Guard]] [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] aircraft was diverted from searching for another T2 tanker {{SS|Fort Mercer||2}} to search for ''Pendleton'', and located both sections. At this point, the Coast Guard realized that they were dealing with two ships that had broken in two. The ''[[Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat CG 36500]]'' was dispatched from [[Chatham, Massachusetts]]. She had four crew on board as the rest of her crew had made themselves scarce on hearing that the {{convert|36|ft|m|adj=on}} ''CG-36500'' was to be sent out to ''Pendleton{{'}}s'' aid.&lt;ref name=USCG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/Pendleton_Webster.asp |title=The Pendleton Rescue |first=W. Russell |last=Webster |publisher=United States Coast Guard |date=December 2001 |accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of ''Pendleton{{'}}s'' 41 crew were lost, eight were on the bow section and the ship's cook from the stern section,&lt;ref name=Wreck&gt;{{cite web |last1=Visser |first1=Auke |title=Pendleton Wreck |url=http://www.aukevisser.nl/t2tanker/id916.htm |website=Auke Visser's Famous T – Tankers Pages |publisher=Auke Visser |accessdate=September 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who had selflessly assisted the rest of the crew off the vessel before him. He was lost when, as the ship started to slide off a sand bar (that she landed on) by the strong gale-force winds, he jumped from the Jacob's ladder, fell into the ocean, and was struck by the lifeboat as it was hit by a wave, killing him instantly. With the survivors on board, a row developed over how they should be dealt with. [[Bernard C. Webber]], of the ''CG-36500'' decided not to transfer them to {{USCGC|McCulloch|WAVP-386|6}} and headed for the beach. The survivors were safely landed at Chatham.&lt;ref name=USCG/&gt;

The rescue of the survivors of the shipwrecked Pendleton is considered one of the most daring rescues of the United States Coast Guard.&lt;ref name="uscg pendleton Rescue"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pendleton Rescue|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/Pendleton_Index.asp|publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]]|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All four crew of ''CG-36500'' were awarded the Coast Guard's [[Gold Lifesaving Medal]].&lt;ref name=Wreck/&gt; At the time of her loss, ''Pendleton'' was insured for [[United States Dollar|$1,690,000]].&lt;ref name=Times200252&gt;{{Cite news |newspaper=[[The Times]] |title=American Shipping Casualties  |date=February 20, 1952 |page=9 |issue=52240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fuel Price Escalator''' (later '''Fuel Duty Stabiliser'''), a [[Hydrocarbon Oil Duty|fuel duty]] policy in the [[United Kingdom]] ahead of inflation, was introduced in March 1993 as a measure to stem the increase in pollution from road transport and cut the need for new road building at a time of major road protests, at [[Twyford Down]] and other locations. Set initially at 3% above inflation it was increased in two stages to 6% before being suspended and then, in 2011, replaced by a 'fuel duty stabiliser' (also known as the 'fuel price stabiliser' and 'fair fuel stabiliser') following further increases the price of oil.

==History==

===Fuel Price Escalator===
At a time of rapidly rising concerns about the effect of road transport on the environment, and in particular from the program of road building which had resulted in major road protests, at [[Twyford Down]] and other locations, the [[Second Major ministry|Conservative's under John Major]] introduced a 'Fuel Price Escalator' in March 1993 set initially at 3% ahead of inflation per year, increased to 5% later in the same year, and then increased again to 6% in 1997 by the [[Blair ministry]] after Labour won power.&lt;ref name=briefing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN03015/SN03015.pdf|title=Taxation of road fuels: the road fuel escalator (1993-2000)|publisher=[[House of Commons Library]]|date=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last rise due to the escalator took place following the budget on 9 March 1999 at a time of rapidly increasing oil prices.&lt;ref name=briefing/&gt; In 2000 at a time of rising [[Fuel protests in the United Kingdom|protests at the cost of fuel]] Gordon Brown announced that the prices would only be increased by inflation due to the [[Price of oil|high price of oil]].&lt;ref name=briefing/&gt;

===Fuel Duty Stabiliser===
Increases were deferred for a number of budgets and then in 2011, at a time of rapidly increasing oil prices, [[George Osborne]] cut 1p from the tax, increased the [[Petroleum Revenue Tax]] to raise at additional £2bn from North Sea oil firms, and announced that the escalator would be replaced with a 'fuel price  stabiliser'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12829433|title=Budget 2011 at a glance: George Osborne's key points|work=BBC News|date=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but would rise if oil prices fell below $75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/budget/8402423/Duty-cut-as-Chancellor-unveils-fair-fuel-stabiliser.html|title=Duty cut as Chancellor unveils fair fuel stabiliser|work=The Telegraph|date=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/11376849/Fuel-duty-rise-could-slow-fall-in-petrol-price-says-minister.html|title=Fuel duty may still rise despite fall in oil prices, says minister|work=The Telegraph|date=2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 budget the Chancellor had also announced a rise of 1p in January 2012 and then 5p in August 2013, but later cancelled the 1p rise and reduced the 5p August rise to 3p in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/2128520/as2011-fuel-duty-rise-cancelled|title=AS2011: Fuel duty rise cancelled|work=Accountancy Age|date=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the budget of 2012 Osborne confirmed the 3p August rise, before first postponing it and then cancelling it in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/dec/05/george-osborne-fuel-duty-autumn-statement|title=George Osborne freezes fuel duty in autumn statement|work=The Guardian|date=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further proposed inflation-based increase in fuel duty was cancelled by the chancellor in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21858399|title=Budget 2013: Fuel duty rise cancelled by chancellor|work=BBC News|date=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker and Van Alstyne observed that, unlike traditional value chains with cost and revenue on different sides, two-sided networks have cost and revenue on both sides, because the “platform” has a distinct group of users on each side.&lt;ref name=Trends&gt;{{cite web |url = http://bizshifts-trends.com/2014/11/09/two-sided-markets-two-sided-networks-yin-yang-business-models-works-google-ebay-amazon-apple-microsoft/ |title = Two-Sided Markets, Two-Sided Networksb &amp; The Yin-Yang of Business Models: Works for Google, eBay, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft. |publisher = BizShifts-Trends |date = 9 November 2014 |accessdate = 30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their approach has been described as the “chicken and egg” problem of how to build a platform.&lt;ref name=Forbes2&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/henrychesbrough/2011/05/09/competing-for-contributors-in-open-innovation/#5bc07fe332c9 |title = Competing for Contributors in Open Innovation |publisher = Forbes |author = Henry Chesbrough |date = 9 May 2011 |accessdate = 30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that the problem must be solved by platform owners, typically by cross-subsidizing between groups or even giving away products or services for free.&lt;ref name=Book&gt;{{cite book |last=Gawer |first=Annabelle |date=2009 |title=Platforms, Markets and Innovation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BvhQT8SHZkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=Google Books |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing Limited |page=21 |isbn=9781848440708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two-sided network effects can cause markets to concentrate in the hands of a few firms.

The '''Goupitan Dam''' ({{zh|s=构皮滩大坝|t=構皮灘大壩|p=Gòupítān Dàbà}}) is an [[arch dam]] on the [[Wu River (Yangtze River tributary)|Wu River]], a tributary of the [[Yangtze River]] in [[Guizhou Province]], southwest of [[China]]. The dam's [[hydroelectric]] facility will operate on five [[water turbine|turbines]], each with a [[hydroelectric]] generating capacity of {{nowrap|600 [[Megawatt|MW]]}}, for a total of {{nowrap|3,000 MW}}. Constructions began on in 2003 and the first generator was operational in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goupitan Hydropower Station|url=http://www.baju.com.cn/web/Production/ProductionShow.asp?ID=192|publisher=Eighth China Water Conservancy and Hydropower Engineering Bureau, Ltd.|accessdate=26 September 2011|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; All works were completed in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Goupitan Hydropower Project|url=http://www.chincold.org.cn/news/li080321-16-Goupitan.pdf|publisher=Chinese National Committee on Large Dams|accessdate=2010-03-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416183422/http://www.chincold.org.cn/news/li080321-16-Goupitan.pdf|archivedate=2014-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.163.com/06/0830/00/2PO1FN8J0001rt.html 构皮滩水电站工程情况简介_网易新闻中心&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gz.xinhuanet.com/zfpd/2007-08/20/content_10907676.htm 四在农家――余庆&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Standard model of particle physics}}
In [[particle physics]], for models with N=1 supersymmetry a '''Higgsino''', symbol {{SubatomicParticle|Higgsino}}, is the [[superpartner]] of the [[Higgs boson|Higgs field]].  A Higgsino is a [[Dirac fermion]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ic field with spin 1/2 and it refers to a [[Weak isospin|weak isodoublet]] with hypercharge half under the Standard Model gauge symmetries.  After [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] higgsino fields linearly mix with U(1) and SU(2) gauginos leading to four [[Neutralino|neutralinos]] and two [[Chargino|charginos]] &lt;ref&gt;resulting from electroweak symmetry breaking of the [[Bino (particle)|bino]] and [[Wino (particle)|wino]] 0, 1, 2&lt;/ref&gt; that refer to physical particles. While the two charginos are charged Dirac fermions (plus and minus each), the neutralinos are electrically neutral [[Majorana fermion]]s. In an [[R-parity]] conserving version of the [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]], the lightest neutralino typically becomes the [[lightest supersymmetric particle]] (LSP). The LSP is a particle physics candidate for the [[dark matter]] of the universe since it cannot decay to particles with lighter mass. A neutralino LSP, depending on its composition can be bino, wino or  higgsino dominated  in nature &lt;ref&gt;http://pdg.lbl.gov/2017/reviews/rpp2017-rev-susy-1-theory.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and can have different zones of mass values in order to satisfy the estimated dark matter relic density. Commonly, a higgsino dominated LSP is often referred as a higgsino, in spite of the fact that a higgsino is not a physical state in true sense.

In [[naturalness (physics)|natural]] scenarios of SUSY, [[stop squark|top squarks]], bottom squarks, [[gluinos]], and higgsino-enriched neutralinos and charginos are expected to be relatively light, enhancing their production cross sections. Higgsino searches have been performed by both the [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] and [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]] experiments at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]], where physicists have searched for the direct electroweak pair production of Higgsinos. As of 2017, no experimental evidence for Higgsinos has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/CombinedSummaryPlots/SUSY/|title=ATLAS Supersymmetry Public Results| publisher=ATLAS, CERN |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/PhysicsResultsSUS|title=CMS Supersymmetry Public Results| publisher=CMS, CERN |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mass ==
If dark matter is composed only of Higgsinos, then the Higgsino mass is 1.1 [[electronvolt|TeV]]. On the other hand, if dark matter has multiple components, then the Higgsino mass depends on the relevant multiverse distribution functions, making the mass of the Higgsino lighter.

[[File:HFIM Prinzip.png|thumb|Structure-borne sound signal in the conventional 2-dimensional diagram "amplitude vs. time" (1) and the same signal as 3-dimensional HFIM process landscape (2). The enhanced signal-to-noise ratio becomes obvious while an impulse-like signal (3) becomes directly evident in the HFIM picture whereas it is not visible in the 2-dimensional diagram.]]
'''HFIM''', acronym for '''high-frequency-impulse-measurement''', is a type of measurement technique in [[acoustics]], where structure-borne sound signals are detected and processed with certain emphasis on short-lived signals as they are indicative for crack formation in a solid body, mostly [[steel]]. The basic idea is to use mathematical signal processing methods such as [[Fourier analysis]] in combination with suitable computer hardware to allow for real-time measurements of acoustic signal amplitudes as well as their distribution in frequency space. The main benefit of this technique is the enhanced [[signal-to-noise ratio]] when it comes to the separation of acoustic emission from a certain source and other, unwanted contamination by any kinds of noise. The technique is therefore mostly applied in industrial production processes, e.g. cold forming or machining, where a 100 percent quality control is required or in [[condition monitoring]] for e.g. quantifying tool wear.

== Physical basics ==
High-frequency-impulse measurement is an algorithm for obtaining frequency information of any structure- or air-borne sound source on the basis of discrete signal transformations. This is mostly done using [Fourier series] to quantify the distribution of the energy content of a sound signal in frequency space. On the software side, the tool used for this is the fast Fourier transform ([[FFT]]) implementation of this mathematical transformation. This allows, in combination with specific hardware, to directly obtain frequency information so that this is accessible in-line, e.g. during a production process. Contrary to classical, off-line frequency analysis methods, the signal is not unfolded before transformation but is directly fed into the FFT computation. Single events, such as cracks, are hence depicted as extremely short-lived signals covering the entire frequency range (the Fourier transform of a single impulse is a signal covering the entire observed frequency space). Therefore, such single events are easily separable from other noises, even if they are much more energetic.

== Applications ==
Because of its in-line capabilities, HFIM is mostly applied in industrial production processes when it comes to high quality standards e.g. for auto parts that are relevant for crash behavior of a car:
* [[Cold forming]]: In cold forming applications, HFIM is mostly used to detect cracks during the forming process. Since such cracks are vastly due to stress in the manufactured part, the spontaneous formation of a crack is accompanied by a very sharp, impulse-like signal in the HFIM process alndscape which can easily be deparated from other noise. Therefore, HFIM is the standard technology for crack detection in the automotove sector all over the world.
* [[Machining]]: In many machining applications, HFIM is used to either monitor the status of tool wear and hence enable pedicitive maintenance or to prevent [[chatter (machining)|chatter]].
* Plastic [[injection molding]]: Here, HFIM is used to monitor the status of the molds which are usually very complex. In particular, breaking off of small pins or other parts of the mold can be detected in-line.
* [[Welding]]: In contrast to most classical monitoring systems for the welding process which usually measure currents or voltages on the welding device, HFIM measures the energy acting directly on the welded workpiece. That allows for detection of various weld imperfactions such as burn-through.

There are also several applications of HFIM devices in materials science laboratories where the exact timing of crack formation is relevant, for instance when determining the [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] of a new kind of steel.

'''Inertance''' is a measure of the pressure difference in a fluid required to cause a unit change in the rate of change of [[volumetric flow-rate]] with time. The base [[SI]] units of inertance are kg m&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; or Pa m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the usual symbol is '''I'''.

The inertance of a tube is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;I = {\rho \cdot \ell \over A} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the [[density]] (with dimensionality of mass per volume) of the fluid
:&lt;math&gt; \ell &lt;/math&gt; is the length of the tube
:&lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional area of the tube

The pressure difference is related to the change in flow-rate by the equation:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta p = I \cdot {\dot Q} = I \cdot {\mathrm d Q \over {\mathrm d t}}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is the [[pressure]] of the fluid
:&lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; is the volumetric flow-rate (with dimensionality of volume per time)
This equation assumes constant density, that the acceleration is uniform, and that the flow is fully developed "plug flow".  This precludes sharp bends, water hammer, and so on.

To some, it may appear counterintuitive that an increase in cross-sectional area of a tube reduces the inertance of the tube. However, for the same mass flow-rate, a lower cross-sectional area implies a higher fluid velocity and therefore a higher pressure difference to accelerate the fluid.

In [[respiratory physiology]], inertance (of air) is measured in cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

1 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 98100 Pa m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Using small-signal analysis, an inertance can be represented as a fluid reactance (c.f. [[electrical reactance]])) through the relation:

:&lt;math&gt; X = j \omega I&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = 2 \pi f&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency in Hz.

In [[thermodynamics]], the '''Joule–Thomson effect''' (also known as the '''Joule–Kelvin effect''', '''Kelvin–Joule effect''') describes the temperature change of a ''real'' gas or liquid (as differentiated from an [[ideal gas]]) when it is forced through a [[Expansion valve (steam engine)|valve]] or [[Enthalpy#Throttling|porous plug]] while keeping them insulated so that no heat is exchanged with the environment.&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some liquids such as hydraulic oils will be warmed by the Joule-Thomson throttling process.

The gas-cooling throttling process is commonly exploited in refrigeration processes such as air conditioners, heat pumps, and liquefiers.&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Moran and H.N. Shapiro "Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics" 5th Edition (2006) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In hydraulics, the warming effect from Joule-Thomson throttling can be used to find internally leaking valves as these will produce heat which can be detected by thermocouple or thermal-imaging camera. Throttling is a fundamentally [[irreversible process]]. The throttling due to the flow resistance in supply lines, heat exchangers, regenerators, and other components of (thermal) machines is a source of losses that limits the performance.

==History==
The effect is named after [[James Prescott Joule]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]], who discovered it in 1852. It followed upon earlier work by Joule on [[Joule expansion]], in which a gas undergoes free expansion in a [[vacuum]] and the temperature is unchanged, if the gas is [[Ideal gas|ideal]].

==Description==
The ''[[adiabatic process|adiabatic]]'' (no heat exchanged) expansion of a gas may be carried out in a number of ways.  The change in temperature experienced by the gas during expansion depends not only on the initial and final pressure, but also on the manner in which the expansion is carried out.
 
*If the expansion process is [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], meaning that the gas is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] at all times, it is called an ''[[isentropic]]'' expansion. In this scenario, the gas does positive [[mechanical work|work]] during the expansion, and its temperature decreases.
*In a [[Joule expansion|free expansion]], on the other hand, the gas does no work and absorbs no heat, so the [[internal energy]] is conserved. Expanded in this manner, the temperature of an [[ideal gas]] would remain constant, but the temperature of a real gas decreases, except at very high temperature.&lt;ref name=":Goussard"&gt;Goussard, J.-O.; Roulet, B. (1993). "Free expansion for real gases". ''Am. J. Phys.'' '''61''': 845–848.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The method of expansion discussed in this article, in which a gas or liquid at pressure ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; flows into a region of lower pressure ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; without significant change in kinetic energy, is called the Joule–Thomson expansion. The expansion is inherently irreversible. During this expansion, [[enthalpy]] remains unchanged (see [[#Proof that the specific enthalpy remains constant|proof]] below). Unlike a free expansion, work is done, causing a change in internal energy. Whether the internal energy increases or decreases is determined by whether work is done on or by the fluid; that is determined by the initial and final states of the expansion and the properties of the fluid.

[[File:Joule-Thomson sign.png|thumb|Sign of the Joule–Thomson coefficient, &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{JT}}&lt;/math&gt; for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Within the region bounded by the red line, a Joule–Thomson expansion produces cooling (&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{JT}} &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;); outside that region, the expansion produces heating. The gas–liquid coexistence curve is shown by the blue line, terminating at the critical point (the solid blue circle). The dashed lines demarcates the regions where N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a supercritical fluid, a liquid, or a gas.]]
The temperature change produced during a Joule–Thomson expansion is quantified by the [[Joule–Thomson effect#The Joule–Thomson (Kelvin) coefficient|Joule–Thomson coefficient]],  &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{JT}}&lt;/math&gt;. This   coefficient may be either positive (corresponding to cooling) or negative (heating); the regions where each occurs for molecular nitrogen, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are shown in the figure. Note that most conditions in the figure correspond to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; being a [[supercritical fluid]], where it has some properties of a gas and some of a liquid, but can not be really described as being either. The coefficient is negative at both very high and very low temperatures; at very high pressure it is negative at all temperatures. The maximum [[inversion temperature]] (621 K for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=":Atkins1"&gt;Atkins, Peter (1997). ''Physical Chemistry'' (6th ed.). New York: W.H. Freeman and Co. p. 930. {{ISBN|0-7167-2871-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) occurs as zero pressure is approached. For N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas at low pressures, &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{JT}}&lt;/math&gt; is negative at high temperatures and positive at low temperatures. At temperatures below the gas-liquid [[Binodal|coexistence curve]], N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; condenses to form a liquid and the coefficient again becomes negative. Thus, for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas below 621 K, a Joule–Thomson expansion can be used to cool the gas until liquid N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forms.

==Physical mechanism==

There are two factors that can change the temperature of a fluid during an adiabatic expansion: a change in internal energy or the conversion between potential and kinetic internal energy. [[Thermodynamic temperature|Temperature]] is the measure of thermal kinetic energy (energy associated with molecular motion); so a change in temperature indicates a change in thermal kinetic energy. The [[Internal energy#Description and definition|internal energy]] is the sum of thermal kinetic energy and thermal potential energy.&lt;ref name=":Rock"&gt;Rock, P. A. (1983). "Chemical Thermodynamics", section 3-2. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA. {{ISBN|0-935702-12-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even if the internal energy does not change, the temperature can change due to conversion between kinetic and potential energy; this is what happens in a free expansion and typically produces a decrease in temperature as the fluid expands.&lt;ref name=":Pippard"&gt;Pippard, A. B. (1957). "Elements of Classical Thermodynamics", p. 73. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tabor, D. (1991). ''Gases, liquids and solids'', p. 148. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K. {{ISBN|0 521 40667 6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If work is done on or by the fluid as it expands, then the total internal energy changes. This is what happens in a Joule–Thomson expansion and can produce larger heating or cooling than observed in a free expansion.

In a Joule–Thomson expansion the enthalpy remains constant. The enthalpy, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;H = U + PV&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is internal energy, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is pressure, and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is volume. Under the conditions of a Joule–Thomson expansion, the change in &lt;math&gt;PV&lt;/math&gt; represents the work done by the fluid (see the [[#Proof that the specific enthalpy remains constant|proof]] below). If &lt;math&gt;PV&lt;/math&gt; increases, with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; constant, then &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; must decrease as a result of the fluid doing work on its surroundings. This produces a decrease in temperature and results in a positive Joule–Thomson coefficient. Conversely, a decrease in &lt;math&gt;PV&lt;/math&gt; means that work is done on the fluid and the internal energy increases. If the increase in internal energy exceeds the increase in potential energy, there will be an increase in the temperature of the fluid and the Joule–Thomson coefficient will be negative.

For an ideal gas, &lt;math&gt;PV&lt;/math&gt; does not change during a Joule–Thomson expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Klotz, I.M. and R. M. Rosenberg (1991). ''Chemical Thermodynamics'', p. 83. Benjamin, Meno Park, California.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there is no change in internal energy; since there is also no change in thermal potential energy, there can be no change in thermal kinetic energy and, therefore, no change in temperature. In real gases, &lt;math&gt;PV&lt;/math&gt; does change.

The ratio of the value of &lt;math&gt;PV&lt;/math&gt; to that expected for an ideal gas at the same temperature is called the [[compressibility factor]], &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. For a gas, this is typically less than unity at low temperature and greater than unity at high temperature (see the discussion in [[Compressibility factor#Physical reason for temperature and pressure dependence|compressibility factor]]). At low pressure, the value of &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; always moves towards unity as a gas expands.&lt;ref name=":Atkins2"&gt;Atkins, Peter (1997). ''Physical Chemistry'' (6th ed.). New York: W.H. Freeman and Co. pp. 31–32. {{ISBN|0-7167-2871-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus at low temperature, &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;PV&lt;/math&gt; will increase as the gas expands, resulting in a positive Joule–Thomson coefficient. At high temperature, &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;PV&lt;/math&gt; decrease as the gas expands; if the decrease is large enough, the Joule–Thomson coefficient will be negative.

For liquids, and for supercritical fluids under high pressure, &lt;math&gt;PV&lt;/math&gt; increases as pressure increases.&lt;ref name=":Atkins2" /&gt; This is due to molecules being forced together, so that the volume can barely decrease due to higher pressure. Under such conditions, the Joule–Thomson coefficient is negative, as seen in the figure [[Joule–Thomson effect#Description|above]].

The physical mechanism associated with the Joule–Thomson effect is closely related to that of a [[shock wave]],&lt;ref&gt;Hoover, Wm G., Carol G. Hoover, and Karl P. Travis. "Shock-Wave Compression and Joule–Thomson Expansion." Physical review letters 112.14 (2014): 144504. http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.144504&lt;/ref&gt; although a shock wave differs in that the change in bulk kinetic energy of the gas flow is not negligible.

This coefficient can be expressed in terms of the gas's volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, its [[Specific heat capacity#Heat capacity of compressible bodies|heat capacity at constant pressure]] &lt;math&gt;C_{\mathrm{p}}&lt;/math&gt;, and its [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; as:&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Edmister/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.chem.arizona.edu/~salzmanr/480a/480ants/jadjte/jadjte.html|title= Joule Expansion|author= W.R.

See the [[#Derivation of the Joule–Thomson coefficient|Derivation of the Joule–Thomson (Kelvin) coefficient]] below for the proof of this relation. The value of &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{JT}}&lt;/math&gt; is typically expressed in °C/[[bar (unit)|bar]] (SI units: [[Kelvin|K]]/[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]) and depends on the type of gas and on the temperature and pressure of the gas before expansion. Its pressure dependence is usually only a few percent for pressures up to 100 bar.

All real gases have an ''inversion point'' at which the value of &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{JT}}&lt;/math&gt; changes sign. The temperature of this point, the ''Joule–Thomson inversion temperature'', depends on the pressure of the gas before expansion.

In a gas expansion the pressure decreases, so the sign of &lt;math&gt;\partial P&lt;/math&gt; is negative by definition. With that in mind, the following table explains when the Joule–Thomson effect cools or warms a real gas:

[[Helium]] and [[hydrogen]] are two gases whose Joule–Thomson inversion temperatures at a pressure of one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] are very low (e.g., about 45 K (−228&amp;nbsp;°C) for helium).  Thus, helium and hydrogen warm when expanded at constant enthalpy at typical room temperatures.  On the other hand, [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]], the two most abundant gases in air, have inversion temperatures of 621 K (348&amp;nbsp;°C) and 764 K (491&amp;nbsp;°C) respectively: these gases can be cooled from room temperature by the Joule–Thomson effect.&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt;

For an ideal gas, &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{JT}}&lt;/math&gt; is always equal to zero: ideal gases neither warm nor cool upon being expanded at constant enthalpy.

==Applications==

In practice, the Joule–Thomson effect is achieved by allowing the gas to expand through a [[Throttle|throttling device]] (usually a [[valve]]) which must be very well insulated to prevent any heat transfer to or from the gas. No external work is extracted from the gas during the expansion (the gas must not be expanded through a [[turbine]], for example).

The cooling produced in the Joule–Thomson expansion makes it a valuable tool in [[refrigeration]].&lt;ref&gt;A.T.A.M. de Waele, Basics of Joule–Thomson Liquefaction and JT Cooling, Journal of Low Temperature Physics, Vol.186, pp.385-403, (2017), {{doi|10.1007/s10909-016-1733-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, J.H. (1970). ''Thermodynamics'', Chapter 15. M.I.T. Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is applied in the [[Hampson–Linde cycle|Linde technique]] as a standard process in the [[petrochemical industry]], where the cooling effect is used to [[Liquefaction of gases|liquefy gases]], and also in many [[cryogenic]] applications (e.g. for the production of liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and [[argon]]). A gas must be below its inversion temperature to be liquefied by the Linde cycle. For this reason, simple Linde cycle liquefiers, starting from ambient temperature, cannot be used to liquefy helium, hydrogen, or [[neon]]. However, the Joule–Thomson effect can be used to liquefy even helium, provided that the helium gas is first cooled below its inversion temperature of 40 K.&lt;ref name=":Atkins1" /&gt;

==Proof that the specific enthalpy remains constant==
{{sister project|project=Wikiversity
|text=[[v:Engineering thermodynamics/Joule–Thomson effect|Wikiversity analyzes this proof in more detail]]}}
In thermodynamics so-called "specific" quantities are quantities per unit mass (kg) and are denoted by lower-case characters. So ''h'', ''u'', and ''v'' are the [[Enthalpy#Specific enthalpy|specific enthalpy]], specific internal energy, and specific volume (volume per unit mass, or reciprocal density), respectively. In a Joule–Thomson process the specific [[enthalpy]] ''h'' remains constant.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. M.J. Moran and H.N. Shapiro "Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics" 5th Edition (2006) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. page 147&lt;/ref&gt; To prove this, the first step is to compute the net work done when a mass ''m'' of the gas moves through the plug. This amount of gas has a volume of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m'' ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in the region at pressure ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (region 1) and a volume ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m'' ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when in the region at pressure ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (region 2). Then in region 1, the "flow work" done ''on'' the amount of gas by the rest of the gas is: W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m'' ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. In region 2, the work done ''by'' the amount of gas on the rest of the gas is: W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m'' ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. So, the total work done ''on'' the mass ''m'' of gas is

: &lt;math&gt;W = mP_1 v_1 - mP_2 v_2.&lt;/math&gt;

The change in internal energy minus the total work done ''on'' the amount of gas is, by the [[first law of thermodynamics]], the total heat supplied to the amount of gas. 
:&lt;math&gt; U - W = Q &lt;/math&gt;
In the Joule–Thomson process the gas is insulated, so no heat is absorbed. This means that

:&lt;math&gt;(mu_2 - mu_1) - (mP_1 v_1 - mP_2 v_2) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; mu_1 + mP_1 v_1 = mu_2 + mP_2 v_2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; u_1 + P_1 v_1 = u_2 + P_2 v_2 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; denote the specific internal energies of the gas in regions 1 and 2, respectively. Using the definition of the specific enthalpy ''h = u + Pv'', the above equation implies that

:&lt;math&gt;h_1 = h_2&lt;/math&gt;

where h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; denote the specific enthalpies of the amount of gas in regions 1 and 2, respectively.

==Throttling in the ''T''-''s'' diagram==

[[File:Throttling in Ts diagram 01.jpg|450px|thumb|right|Fig. 2 – ''T''-''s'' diagram of nitrogen. The red dome represents the two-phase region with the low-entropy side (the saturated liquid) and the high-entropy side (the saturated gas). The black curves give the ''T''-''s'' relation along isobars. The pressures are indicated in bar. The blue curves are isenthalps (curves of constant specific enthalpy). The specific enthalpies are indicated in kJ/kg. The specific points a, b, etc., are treated in the main text.]]

A very convenient way to get a quantitative understanding of the throttling process is by using diagrams. There are many types of diagrams (''h''-''T'' diagram, ''h''-''P'' diagram, etc.) Commonly used are the so-called ''T''-''s'' diagrams. Figure 2 shows the ''T''-''s'' diagram of nitrogen as an example.&lt;ref&gt;Figure composed with data obtained with RefProp, NIST Standard Reference Database 23&lt;/ref&gt; Various points are indicated as follows:
:'''a)''' ''T'' = 300 K, ''p'' = 200 bar, ''s'' = 5.16 kJ/(kgK), ''h'' = 430 kJ/kg;
:'''b)''' ''T'' = 270 K, ''p'' = 1 bar, ''s'' = 6.79 kJ/(kgK), ''h'' = 430 kJ/kg;
:'''c)''' ''T'' = 133 K, ''p'' = 200 bar, ''s'' = 3.75 kJ/(kgK), ''h'' = 150 kJ/kg;
:'''d)''' ''T'' = 77.2 K, ''p'' = 1 bar, ''s'' = 4.40 kJ/(kgK), ''h'' = 150 kJ/kg;
:'''e)''' ''T'' = 77.2 K, ''p'' = 1 bar, ''s'' = 2.83 kJ/(kgK), ''h'' = 28 kJ/kg (saturated liquid at 1 bar);
:'''f)''' ''T'' = 77.2 K, ''p'' = 1 bar, ''s'' = 5.41 kJ/(kgK), ''h'' =230 kJ/kg (saturated gas at 1 bar).

As shown before, throttling keeps ''h'' constant. E.g. throttling from 200 bar and 300 K (point a in fig. 2) follows the isenthalp (line of constant specific enthalpy) of 430 kJ/kg. At 1 bar it results in point b which has a temperature of 270 K. So throttling from 200 bar to 1 bar gives a cooling from room temperature to below the freezing point of water. Throttling from 200 bar and an initial temperature of 133 K (point c in fig. 2) to 1 bar results in point d, which is in the two-phase region of nitrogen at a temperature of 77.2 K. Since the enthalpy is an extensive parameter the enthalpy in d (''h''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) is equal to the enthalpy in e (''h''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) multiplied with the mass fraction of the liquid in d (''x''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) plus the enthalpy in f (''h''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) multiplied with the mass fraction of the gas in d (1 &amp;minus; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;). So

:&lt;math&gt;h_d = x_d h_e + (1 - x_d) h_f.&lt;/math&gt;

With numbers: 150 = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; 28 + (1 &amp;minus; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) 230 so ''x''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is about 0.40. This means that the mass fraction of the liquid in the liquid–gas mixture leaving the throttling valve is 40%.

==Derivation of the Joule–Thomson coefficient==

It is difficult to think physically about what the Joule–Thomson coefficient,  &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{JT}}&lt;/math&gt;, represents. Also, modern determinations of &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{JT}}&lt;/math&gt;  do not use the original method used by Joule and Thomson, but instead measure a different, closely related quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Physical Chemistry|last = Atkins|first = Peter|publisher = W.H. Freeman and Co.|year = 1997|isbn = 0-7167-2871-0|location = New York|pages = 89–90|edition = 6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is useful to derive relationships between &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{JT}}&lt;/math&gt; and other, more convenient quantities. That is the purpose of this section.

The first step in obtaining these results is to note that the Joule–Thomson coefficient involves the three variables ''T'', ''P'', and ''H''. A useful result is immediately obtained by applying the [[Triple product rule|cyclic rule]]; in terms of these three variables that rule may be written

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial P}\right)_H\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_P \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial H}\right)_T = -1.&lt;/math&gt;

Each of the three partial derivatives in this expression has a specific meaning. The first is &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{JT}}&lt;/math&gt;, the second is the constant pressure [[heat capacity]], &lt;math&gt;C_{\mathrm{p}}&lt;/math&gt;, defined by

:&lt;math&gt;C_{\mathrm{p}} = \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_P &lt;/math&gt;

and the third is the inverse of the ''isothermal Joule–Thomson coefficient'', &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{T}}&lt;/math&gt;, defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{T}} = \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial P}\right)_T &lt;/math&gt;.
This last quantity is more easily measured than &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{JT}}&lt;/math&gt; .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The pressure variation of the heat function as a direct measure of the van der Waals forces|last = Keyes|first = F.G.|date = 1932|journal = Proc.

Chem. Thermodynamics|doi = 10.1006/jcht.1995.0073|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = McBain|first2 = S.E.|last3 = Saville|first3 = G.|volume = 27|pages = 721–733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the expression from the cyclic rule becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{JT}} = - \frac{\mu_{\mathrm{T}}} {C_p}.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be used to obtain Joule–Thomson coefficients from the more easily measured isothermal Joule–Thomson coefficient. It is used in the following to obtain a mathematical expression for the Joule–Thomson coefficient in terms of the volumetric properties of a fluid.

To proceed further, the starting point is the [[Fundamental thermodynamic relation|fundamental equation of thermodynamics]] in terms of enthalpy; this is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}H = T \mathrm{d}S + V \mathrm{d}P.&lt;/math&gt;

Now "dividing through" by d''P'', while holding temperature constant, yields

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial P}\right)_T = T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial P}\right)_T  + V&lt;/math&gt;
The partial derivative on the left is the isothermal Joule–Thomson coefficient, &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{T}}&lt;/math&gt;, and the one on the right can be expressed in terms of the coefficient of thermal expansion via a [[Maxwell relation]]. The appropriate relation is 
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial P}\right)_T= -\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P= -V\alpha\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α'' is the cubic [[coefficient of thermal expansion]]. Replacing these two partial derivatives yields

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{T}} = - T V\alpha\ + V. &lt;/math&gt;

This expression can now replace &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{T}}&lt;/math&gt; in the earlier equation for &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{JT}}&lt;/math&gt; to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{JT}} \equiv \left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial P} \right)_H = \frac V {C_{\mathrm{p}}} (\alpha T - 1).\,&lt;/math&gt;

This provides an expression for the Joule–Thomson coefficient in terms of the commonly available properties heat capacity, molar volume, and thermal expansion coefficient. It shows that the Joule–Thomson inversion temperature, at which &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{JT}}&lt;/math&gt; is zero, occurs when the coefficient of thermal expansion is equal to the inverse of the temperature. Since this is true at all temperatures for ideal gases (see [[Thermal expansion#Isobaric expansion in gases|expansion in gases]]), the Joule–Thomson coefficient of an ideal gas is zero at all temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Thermodynamics|last = Callen|first = H.B|publisher = John Wiley and Sons|year = 1960|location = New York|pages = 112–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Joule's second law ==

It is easy to verify that for an [[ideal gas]] defined by suitable microscopic postulates that ''αT'' = 1, so the temperature change of such an ideal gas at a Joule–Thomson expansion is zero.
For such an ideal gas, this theoretical result implies that:

:''The internal energy of a fixed mass of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature (not pressure or volume).''

This rule was originally found by Joule experimentally for real gases and is known as '''Joule's second law'''. More refined experiments of course found important deviations from it.&lt;ref&gt;[[J.R. Partington|Partington, J.R.]] (1949). ''An Advanced Treatise on Physical Chemistry'', volume 1 ''Fundamental Principles. The Properties of Gases'', [[Longman|Longmans, Green and Co.]], London, pp. 614–615.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983).

By surface 80% of South America’s glaciers lie in Chile. Glaciers develop in the [[Andes]] of Chile from 27˚S southwards and in a very few places north of 18°30'S in the extreme north of the country:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geography.osu.edu/faculty/bmark/2008%20ESR%20Vuille_etal.pdf Climate change and tropical Andean glaciers: Past, present and future] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106032056/http://www.geography.osu.edu/faculty/bmark/2008%20ESR%20Vuille_etal.pdf |date=2012-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in between they are absent because of extreme aridity, though [[rock glacier]]s formed from [[permafrost]] are common. The largest glaciers of Chile are the [[Northern Patagonian Ice Field|Northern]] and [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]]s. From a latitude of 47° S and south some glaciers reach sea level.

Apart from height and latitude, the settings of Chilean glaciers depend on precipitation patterns; in this sense two different regions exist: the [[Dry Andes]] and the [[Wet Andes]].

The '''Malia altar stone''' is a stone slab bearing an inscription in [[Cretan hieroglyphs]]. It was found by a farmer near [[Malia (city)|Malia]], [[Crete]].  Chapouthier describes the find from an archeologist point of view.&lt;ref name="Malia description"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Inscription hiéroglyphique gravée sur un bloc de calcaire |first=Fernand |last=Chapouthier |journal=Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique |issue=Vol. 62, (1938)|pages=104-109}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Olivier and Godard (1996) present several photographs of the Malia altar stone, which they list as item 328 in their inventory of Cretan hieroglyphs inscriptions. 

The stone has a cuplike cavity and is thought to be a [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[altar stone]]. The side of the Malia altar stone contains an inscription with sixteen glyphs. The inscription is the only known instance of Cretan hieroglyphs on stone and is significant as one of the longest Cretan hieroglyphs inscriptions. Of the sixteen glyphs of the inscription, three occur twice each. Some of the glyphs show similarities with those of the [[Arkalochori Axe]] and the [[Phaistos Disc]]. Revesz gives a translation of the text and discusses earlier translation attempts.&lt;ref name="Arkalochori translation"&gt; {{Cite journal|title=A translation of the Arkalochori Axe and the Malia Altar Stone|first=Peter Z.|last=Revesz|journal=WSEAS Transactions on Information Science and Applications|issue=Vol. 14, (2017)|pages=124-133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pack station''' is the base of operations for transporting [[freight]] via [[pack animal]]s in areas that do not allow for other forms transportation, either due to difficult access or use restrictions as defined in [[Wilderness Act]]. The station facilitates the transition from mechanized transportation to pack animals, and necessarily includes a [[corral]] for the animals and sometimes a stock loading ramp.  In some places there may also be a [[barn]] or other structure to house [[compound feed|feed]] and [[Horse tack|tack]], and a [[loading dock]] or shelter for the items to be transported.   In locations on private land, there may be a business office on site. 

The term "pack station" is most often used in California in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains.   In other parts of the USA, outfitters may simply refer to a permanent or semi-permanent trailhead or wilderness camp  as a "station" or "outfitter camp."

== How packing works ==
One [[Wrangler (profession)|wrangler]] on horseback can usually handle up to five pack mules, who are tethered together in a line called a pack string.

Many commercial outfitters today support [[recreation|recreation activities]] such as [[camping]] and [[fishing]] trips and [[hunting]] expeditions. Government agencies such as the [[U.S. Forest Service]] and the [[National Park Service]], as well as a few commercial outfitters have pack operations to transport [[construction]] materials, trail tools, and fire fighting equipment into wilderness areas.

In either case, the process and techniques used are very similar to those developed prior to the era of motor vehicles. Customers arrange for a meeting time or a delivery time and drop their goods and supplies at the pack station. Packing services are charged by the pound or by the animal, typically with a minimum price depending on the distance from the pack station. Everything is weighed, sorted for each animal, then split 50/50 to get a balanced load on each side of the animal; an unbalanced load will cause the saddle to slide to the heavy side, causing discomfort to the animal, and potentially inviting disaster. The average [[mule]] can carry as much as {{convert|300|lb|kg|-1|sp=us}}. A mammoth [[donkey]] can carry up to {{convert|200|lb|kg|-1|abbr=on}} and standard donkey limit is {{convert|125|lb|kg|-1|abbr=on}}.  However, most pack station mule loads are limited to {{convert|150|lb|kg|-1|sp=us}}

== Permits ==
Outfitters generally operate within the boundaries of public land and are required to maintain an outfitters permit. [[USDA]] [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] calls this a special-use permit. A separate permit is required if the pack station or wilderness caches are located on public land.

'''Paracrystalline''' materials are defined as having short- and medium-range ordering in their lattice (similar to the [[liquid crystal]] phases) but lacking [[crystal]]-like long-range ordering at least in one direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1407319|title=Structure and physical properties of paracrystalline atomistic models of amorphous silicon|year=2001|last1=Voyles|first1=P. M.|last2=Zotov|first2=N.|last3=Nakhmanson|first3=S. M.|last4=Drabold|first4=D. A.|last5=Gibson|first5=J. M.|last6=Treacy|first6=M. M. J.|last7=Keblinski|first7=P.|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=90|issue=9|pages=4437|bibcode = 2001JAP....90.4437V |url=https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/64416/Voyles%20a-Si%20Model%20Analysis%20JAP%202001.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordering is the regularity in which atoms appear in a predictable lattice, as measured from one point. In a highly ordered, perfectly crystalline material, or [[single crystal]], the location of every atom in the structure can be described exactly measuring out from a single origin. Conversely, in a disordered structure such as a liquid or [[amorphous solid]], the location of the nearest and, perhaps, second-nearest neighbors can be described from an origin (with some degree of uncertainty) and the ability to predict locations decreases rapidly from there out. The distance at which atom locations can be predicted is referred to as the [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] length &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;. A paracrystalline material exhibits correlation somewhere between the fully amorphous and fully crystalline.

The primary, most accessible source of [[crystallinity]] information is [[X-ray scattering techniques|X-ray diffraction]] and [[Cryogenic electron microscopy|cryo-electron microscopy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berriman|first=J.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy can provide real-space and reciprocal space characterization of paracrystallinity in nanoscale material, such as quantum dot solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=B.

Kourkoutis|title=Propagation of Structural Disorder in Epitaxially Connected Quantum Dot Solids from Atomic to Micron Scale|year=2016|volume=16|pages=5714–5718|doi=10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b02382|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b02382|journal=Nano Letters|bibcode=2016NanoL..16.5714S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scattering of X-rays, neutrons and electrons on paracrystals is quantitatively described by the theories of the ideal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF01339555 | volume=128 | title=Röntgeninterferenzen an Stoffen mit flüssigkeitsstatistischen Gitterstörungen | year=1950 | journal=Zeitschrift für Physik | pages=1–35 | last1 = Hosemann | first1 = Rolf| bibcode=1950ZPhy..128....1H }}&lt;/ref&gt; and real&lt;ref&gt;R. Hosemann: Grundlagen der Theorie des Parakristalls und ihre Anwendungensmöglichkeiten bei der Untersuchung der Realstruktur kristalliner Stoffe, Kristall und Technik, Band 11, 1976, S. 1139–1151&lt;/ref&gt; paracrystal.

Rolf Hosemann’s definition of an ideal paracrystal is: "The electron density distribution of any material is equivalent to that of a paracrystal when there is for every building block one ideal point so that the distance statistics to other ideal points is identical for all of these points. The electron configuration of each building block around its ideal point is statistically independent of its counterpart in neighboring building blocks. A building block corresponds then to the material content of a cell of this "blurred" space lattice, which is to be considered a paracrystal."&lt;ref&gt;R. Hosemann, Der ideale Parakristall und die von ihm gestreute kohaerente Roentgenstrahlung, Zeitschrift für Physik 128 (1950) 465-492&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerical differences in analyses of diffraction experiments on the basis of either of these two theories of paracrystallinity can often be neglected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1107/S0567739481000156 | volume=37 | title=Novel aspects of the real paracrystal | year=1981 | journal=Acta Crystallographica Section A | pages=85–91 | last1 = Hosemann | first1 = R. | last2 = Vogel | first2 = W. | last3 = Weick | first3 = D. | last4 = Baltá-Calleja | first4 = F. J.| bibcode=1981AcCrA..37...85H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just like ideal crystals, ideal paracrystals extend theoretically to infinity. Real paracrystals, on the other hand, follow the empirical α*-law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hosemann | first1 = R. | last2 = Hentschel | first2 = M. P. | last3 = Balta-Calleja | first3 = F. J. | last4 = Cabarcos | first4 = E. Lopez | last5 = Hindeleh | first5 = A. M. | year = 2001 | title = The α*-constant, equilibrium state and bearing netplanes in polymers, biopolymers and catalysts | url = | journal = Journal of Physics C: Solid State Physics | volume = 18 | issue = 5| pages = 249–254 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which restricts their size. That size is also indirectly proportional to the components of the tensor of the paracrystalline distortion. Larger solid state aggregates are then composed of micro-paracrystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF01143202 | volume=26 | title=Microparacrystals: The intermediate stage between crystalline and amorphous | year=1991 | journal=Journal of Materials Science | pages=5127–5133 | last1 = Hindeleh | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Hosemann | first2 = R.| bibcode=1991JMatS..26.5127H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The words "paracrystallinity" and "paracrystal" were coined by the late Friedrich Rinne in the year 1933.&lt;ref&gt;F. Rinne, Investigations and considerations concerning paracrystallinity, Transactions of the Faraday Society 29 (1933) 1016-1032&lt;/ref&gt; Their German equivalents, e.g. "Parakristall", appeared in print one year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1039/TF9332901016 | volume=29 | title=Investigations and considerations concerning paracrystallinity | year=1933 | journal=Transactions of the Faraday Society | page=1016 | last1 = Rinne | first1 = Friedrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paracrystalline model is a revision of the [[Continuous Random Network]] model first proposed by W. H. Zachariasen in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zachariasen, W.H.|journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc.|volume=54|year=1932|pages= 3841|doi=10.1021/ja01349a006|issue=10|title=The Atomic Arrangement in Glass}}&lt;/ref&gt; One type of paracrystal model contains highly strained, microcrystalline crystallites surrounded by fully amorphous material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cowley, J.M. |year=1981 |title=Diffraction Studies on Non-Crystalline Substances |editor1=I. Hargittai |editor2=W. J. Orville Thomas |publisher=Akademia Kiado |location=Budapest |isbn=9780444997524 |pages=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a higher energy state than the continuous random network model. The important distinction between this model and the microcrystalline phases is the lack of defined grain boundaries and highly strained lattice parameters, which makes calculations of molecular and lattice dynamics difficult. A general theory of paracrystals has been formulated in a basic textbook,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hosemann R. |author2=Bagchi R.N. |year=1962 |title=Direct analysis of diffraction by matter |publisher=North-Holland |location=Amsterdam; New York |oclc=594302398 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then further developed/refined by various authors.

==Applications==
The paracrystal model has been useful, for example, in describing the state of partially amorphous semiconductor materials after deposition. It has also been successfully applied to synthetic polymers, liquid crystals, biopolymers, quantum dot solids, and biomembranes.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Parchment craft''', also known as '''''Pergamano''''', is the art of embellishing and decorating [[parchment]] paper (or [[vellum]] paper) through the use of techniques such as [[Embossing (paper)|embossing]], perforating, [[stippling]], cutting and coloring.

Parchment Craft has been predominantly used in the making of cards ([[Holy card|religious devotional cards]], greeting cards and gift cards) but the techniques are being applied to related items such as bookmarks and picture frames as well as 3-dimensional sculptural paper projects such as ornaments and boxes.&lt;ref&gt;Ospina, Martha. Pergamano: Parchment Craft Basic Techniques. Baarn, The Netherlands: La Rivière, 1997. {{ISBN|90-384-1247-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Janet. The Art of Parchment Craft. Kent: Search Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-85532-823-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Historians believe that parchment craft originated as an art form in Europe during the 15th or 16th century. Parchment craft at that time occurred principally in Catholic communities, where crafts persons created lace-like items such as devotional pictures and communion cards. The craft developed over time, with new techniques and refinements being added. Until the 16th century, parchment craft was a European art form. However, missionaries and other settlers relocated to South America, taking parchment craft with them. As before, the craft appeared largely among the Catholic communities. Often, young girls receiving their First Communion received gifts of handmade parchment crafts.

Although the invention of the printing press led to a reduced interest in hand made cards and items, by the 18th century, people were regaining interest in detailed handwork. Parchment cards became larger in size and crafters began adding wavy borders and perforations. In the 19th century, influenced by French romanticism, parchment crafters began adding floral themes and cherubs and hand embossing.

==Tools==
There are many tools involved in parchment craft; each has its specific purpose and use.

===Mapping pen===
Designs are traced onto parchment using a ''mapping pen'' and acrylic ink (usually white, but various colors are used to accent purposes). A mapping pen uses a [[Nib (pen)|nib]] which is dipped in ink.

===White pencil===
Designs can also be traced onto the parchment using a white pencil. This technique is usually used for very fine lines that will be directly traced over during the embossing process. The white pencil is used in this case because if one was to trace directly over an inked line, it would become black.

===Embossing tools===
Embossing tools come in many sizes. The larger the tool the softer the embossing and the "greyer" the color of the embossed shape; the smaller the tool the "whiter" and more "satiny" the color of the embossed shape. The tips of these tools also are made with different materials, some plastic – for lighter embossing – and some steel – for the brighter whites. The tools range from "large ball" to "extra fine ball" and a "stylus" (for very fine lines and intricate details).

===Needle tools===
Needle tools are sometimes used for embossing details, but mostly are used for perforating to make decorative, lace-like patterns. Needle tools have either single or multiple points and are used for different purposes. A single needle tool is used for embossing or stippling. A 2 needle tool is used for even perforations for marking areas which are to be cut with scissors. A 4 needle tool is square-shaped and a necessity for classic lace patterns. 3,5,7 and half-circle needle tools are used for decorative additions to lace patterns. A scissors is used in combination with needle tools to cut crosses and slots into the patterning.

=== Embossing and perforating pads===
These pads are to be used as support whenever pressure is placed upon the parchment. For embossing a soft pad is required to provide even support. For perforating a felt pad is used.

===Coloring tools===
To color parchment craft work many media can be used such as: 
* Inks-any waterproof or acrylic ink
* [[Acrylic paint]]s
* [[Oil pastel]]s
* Watercolor pencils
* Felt-tip pens or markers
* Blendable pencils are probably the most commonly used form of colouring.

==Techniques==

===Tracing===
This is the first step in any Parchment Craft project. Tracing creates the guidelines for the areas of the design that are to be embossed. Tracing is done using the mapping pen and ink. Parchment has two sides-one with a smooth surface and one with a rough surface; tracing is done on the side with the rough surface because the ink more easily adheres to this type of surface. When tracing the mapping pen should be allowed to glide easily over the parchment, no pressure should be used as this increases the amount of ink that is dispersed from the nib and may also create an unintentional embossment.

===Embossing===
[[Embossing (paper)|Embossing]] is the process of creating raised relief within one's design. Embossing is used to create both concave and convex shapes by alternating the side on which the embossing is performed. Using the embossing tools and appropriate embossing pad, the parchment is rubbed backwards and forwards or side to side in parallel movements with increasing downward pressure so that the parchment can be evenly stretched. A finished embossment will be satin-white in color and will contrast with the translucency of the parchment paper. Color can be varied by moderating the level to which the shape is embossed. Fine lines and hatching can be obtained by embossing with the stylus tool.

===Stippling===
The single needle tool is used for [[stippling]]. Stippling is a technique used for generating a matte white surface to areas or for fine detail work such as the centers of flowers. To create a matte white surface the parchment is first lightly embossed and then small holes are perforated on the parchment in very close proximity. The perforation is done using a cardboard pad rather than a felt pad so that the needle will not pierce through the parchment, but rather create an embossed dot.

===Perforating===
Perforating is used to create decorative and special lace patterns in Parchment Craft. Minimal tracing is required when perforating; designs are usually created by taping the parchment over a pattern and perforating directly over it. Various needle tools are used in the perforating technique. Perforating is also used to create edging and borders or to denote guidelines for cutting.

===Cutting===
Cutting is used in combination with perforating. Cutting is used with the 2 needle tool to remove shapes from the design; it is used with the 4 needle tool to create crosses and strips within a lace pattern.

===Coloring===
Coloring is a technique that gained popularity in Parchment Craft in the 20th century; before this, Parchment Craft was originally only white work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Janet|title=The Art of Parchment Craft|year=1997|publisher=Search Press|location=Kent|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many methods for coloring Parchment Craft work. One of the most popular is "dorsing". Dorsing creates a soft background color for embossed shapes or the areas around them. Color is applied in the dorsing process using oil pastels or Dorso crayons which are rubbed on and then blended using paper toweling and odorless mineral spirits or an oil based medium such as linseed or lavender oil. For coloring that is applied to the parchment in entirety, the coloring is done before any tracing or embossing. If color is to be added to small areas, dorsing would be applied in a similar manner to specific areas before the embossing process. Dorsing can also be done using other coloring media such as felt-tip pens/markers, watercolor pencils, acrylic paints or inks.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4923">Passive [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|heave]] compensation is a technique used to reduce the influence of [[Wind wave|waves]] upon lifting and drilling operations.&lt;ref&gt;Passive and Active heave Compensation, Albers, TU Delft&lt;/ref&gt; A simple passive heave compensator (PHC) is a soft spring which utilizes [[Vibration isolation|spring isolation]] to reduce [[Transmissibility (vibration)|transmissibility]] to less than 1.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Wilde and Jake Ormond: ''Subsea Heave Compensators'', Deep Offshore Technology 2009&lt;/ref&gt; PHC differs from [[Active heave compensation|AHC]] by not consuming external power.

==Principle==
The main principle in PHC is to store the energy from the external forces ([[Wind wave|waves]]) influencing the system and dissipate them or reapply them later. [[Shock absorber]]s or [[drill string compensator]]s are simple forms of PHC, so simple that they are normally named [[heave compensator]]s, while "[[Passivity (engineering)|passive]]" is used about more sophisticated hydraulic or mechanical systems.

A typical PHC device consists of a hydraulic cylinder and a gas accumulator. When the piston rod extends it will reduce the total gas volume and hence compress the gas that in turn increases the pressure acting upon the piston. The [[compression ratio]] is low to ensure low stiffness. A well designed PHC device can achieve efficiencies above 80 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safelink.no/ The Engineers Guide] Safelink AS&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
PHC is often used on offshore equipment that is at or linked to the seabed. Not requiring external energy, PHC may be designed as a fail-safe system reducing the wave impact on sub-sea operations.&lt;ref&gt;Passive Heave Compensation, www.huismanequipment.com/en/products/heave_compensation/passive_heave_compensation&lt;/ref&gt; PHC may be used along with [[active heave compensation]] to form a semi-active system.&lt;ref&gt;Passive Heave Compensation of Heavy Modules, Sten Magne Eng Jakobsen, 2008, University of Stavanger [http://brage.bibsys.no/uis/bitstream/URN:NBN:no-bibsys_brage_7771/1/Jakobsen%2c%20Sten%20Magne.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation of PHC==

===Efficiency for a PHC used during offshore lifting operations===
[[File:PHC sketch.png|thumb|Sketch of system]]
The PHC device is in this calculation connected to the crane hook. [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton`s second law]] is used to describe the acceleration of the payload:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; (m+m_A) \ddot y =-k_c(y+H \cos \omega t) &lt;/math&gt;

Where&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; - is the [[mass]] of the load underneath the PHC device&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; m_A &lt;/math&gt; - is the [[added mass]] of the load underneath the PHC device&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \ddot y &lt;/math&gt; - is the [[acceleration]] of the mass of the load underneath the PHC device&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; k_c &lt;/math&gt; - is the [[stiffness]] of the PHC device&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; - is the vertical position of the mass underneath the PHC device&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; H &lt;/math&gt; - is the wave amplitude&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; - is the angular wave frequency&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt; - is time&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If we ignore the transient solution we will find that the ratio between the amplitude of the load and the wave amplitude is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \frac {A}{H} = \frac{ \frac {k_c}{m+m_A}} { \omega^2 - \frac {k_c}{m+m_A}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To simplify the expression it is common to introduce &lt;math&gt; \omega _0 &lt;/math&gt; as the systems natural frequency, defined as:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \omega _0 = \sqrt {\frac {k_c}{m+m_A}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We then get the following expression for the ratio:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \frac {A}{H} = \frac {1}{({\frac {\omega}{\omega_0}})^2-1}&lt;/math&gt;

The transmissibility &lt;math&gt; T_R &lt;/math&gt; is defined as:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; T_R= \left | \frac {1}{({\frac {\omega}{\omega_0}})^2-1}  \right |&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally the efficiency is defined as:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \eta_{PHC}= 1-T_R &lt;/math&gt;

===Calculating PHC stiffness===
The stiffness of a PHC device is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Albers: ''Motion Control in Offshore and Dredging'', Springer, 2010. {{ISBN|978-9048188024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; k_c= \frac {p_0 A}{S}(C^\kappa-1) &lt;/math&gt;

Where&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; p_0 &lt;/math&gt; - is the gas pressure at equilibrium stroke&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; - is the piston area&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; - is the stroke length&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; - is the compression ratio&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \kappa &lt;/math&gt; - is the adiabatic coefficient

The product &lt;math&gt; p_0 A &lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the submerged weight of the payload. As can be seen from the expression it is clear that low compression ratios as well as long stroke length gives low stiffness.

[[Image:Persoz pendulum.jpg|thumb|250px|Persoz pendulum]]
A '''Persoz pendulum''' is a device used for measuring [[Hardness (materials science)|hardness of materials]]. The instrument consists of a [[pendulum]] which is free to swing on two balls resting on a coated test panel. The pendulum hardness test is based on the principle that the [[amplitude]] of the pendulum's [[oscillation]] will decrease more quickly when supported on a softer surface. The hardness of any given coating is given by the number of oscillations made by the pendulum within the specified limits of amplitude determined by accurately positioned photo sensors. An electronic counter records the number of swings made by the pendulum
==Construction==
[[Image:Persoz complete.jpg|thumb|250px|Persoz pendulum device]]
The pendulum consists of balls which rest on the coating under test and form the [[Fulcrum (mechanics)|fulcrum]]. The Persoz pendulum is very similar to the '''Konig pendulum'''. Both employ the same principle, that is the softer the coating the more the pendulum oscillations are damped and the shorter the time needed for the amplitude of oscillation to be reduced by a specified amount. The two pendulums differ in shape, mass and oscillation time, and there is no general relationship between the results obtained using the two pieces of equipment. In either case, the test simply involves noting the time in seconds for the amplitude of swing to decrease from either 6 to 3 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] (Konig pendulum) or 12 to 4 degrees (Persoz pendulum).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pra-world.com/technical/testingphysicalhardness.htm PRA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6497">'''Piero Giorgio Bordoni''' (Rome, 18 July 1915 – 19 September 2009) was an Italian [[physicist]], who first measured the anelastic relaxation effect ([[dissipation]] of [[elastic energy]] and softening of the [[elastic modulus]]), named after him, due to the stress induced motion of [[dislocations]] in metals.&lt;ref name="Bor49"&gt;P.G. Bordoni, ''La Ricerca Scientifica'', '''19''', 851 (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; That experiment, together with a similar one by T.S. Kê,&lt;ref&gt;T.S. Ke, ''Transactions of AIME'' '''167''', 192 (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; opened the way to the study of the dynamics of dislocations in solids. Those were also the first experiments of anelasticity in solids, a branch of [[physics]] studying defects, excitations and [[phase transitions]] in condensed matter, first systematised by [[Clarence Zener]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Zener, ''Elasticity and Anelasticity in Metals'', (University of Chicago Press, 1948)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He received the Degree in Electrotechnical Engineering at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] in 1937, following the steps of his father, Ugo Bordoni, Engineering Professor in the same Faculty (after whom the [[Fondazione Ugo Bordoni]] was named in Italy, established in 1952 for supporting research and applications of telecommunications).

His interest in acoustics was first aroused, still a student in 1936, by the invitation to join the newly founded Institute of Ultracoustics (later of Electroacoustics and then of Acoustics) of [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche]] (CNR), then directed by [[Orso Mario Corbino]].

During the [[Second World War]], he was initially in the Aeronautics and head of the Laboratory of Electroacoustics in Guidonia, where he worked at acoustically triggered [[torpedoes]] for the Navy.

In 1944 he became researcher of the Institute of Ultracoustics.

In 1947/8 he obtained a fellowship from CNR to stay 8 months at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] of Boston for studying the acoustic properties of [[lead]] down to [[liquid helium]] temperatures in the laboratory of [[John C. Slater]], and discovered the anelastic effect due to [[dislocations]], later named "Bordoni relaxation" or "Bordoni peak".

In 1949 he became assistant professor of Rational Mechanics at the Engineering Faculty of the Sapienza University of Rome and left the Institute of Acoustics. In 1954 became Professor of Mathematical Physics at the [[University of Pisa]], where he remained until 1962, when he passed to the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Rome. He taught in Rome until 1985, but also carried out experimental scientific activity on the anelasticity of metals containing dislocations and interstitial hydrogen at the Institute of Acoustics "O.M. Corbino" of CNR, until 1998.

For his scientific achievements, he received an [[honorary degree]] in [[physics]] from the [[University of Perugia]] in 1988 and the Zener Prize in 1993. He had many interests besides physics, like ancient history and languages, and wrote witty sonnets in the style of the ‘Romanesco’ poet [[Giuseppe Gioachino Belli]], inspired by episodes at the university and in the life.

==Scientific activity==
After an initial activity on electroacoustic transducers, he started measuring the complex dynamic [[elastic modulus]] of metals at low temperature, so carrying out the earliest researches of anelasticity in solids. During a stay in 1948 in the laboratory of John C. Slater at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology of Boston, where liquid helium for reaching very low temperatures was available, he discovered an anelastic relaxation process in Pb immediately recognized as due to the stress induced motion of dislocations.&lt;ref name="Bor49" /&gt; That type of relaxation, due to the motion of dislocations without the participation of mobile [[point defect]]s, is known as "Bordoni relaxation"’ or "Bordoni peak", since it appears as a peak in the elastic energy dissipation versus temperature. Bordoni pursued this type of investigations, extending it to other metals with [[face-centered cubic]] structure, like [[copper]], [[silver]], [[gold]], [[palladium]], [[platinum]]&lt;ref&gt;P. G. Bordoni, M. Nuovo and L. Verdini, ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' '''2''', 200 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; but also [[body-centered cubic]] structure, like [[niobium]],&lt;ref&gt;P. G. Bordoni, M. Nuovo and L. Verdini, ''Phys. Rev.'' '''123''', 1204 (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; and with anisotropic [[hexagonal]] structure, where the simple change of temperature causes plastic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;M.H. Youssef and P.G. Bordoni, "Influence of dislocations generated by temperature changes on the elastic behaviour of hexagonal polycrystals", ''Phil. Mag. A'' '''67''', 883 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Models of increasing sophistication have been developed to explain the complex phenomenology of the Bordoni relaxation,&lt;ref&gt;R. Schaller, G. Fantozzi and G. Gremaud, "Mechanical Spectroscopy Q-1 2001: with Applications to Materials Science", ''Trans Tech Publications'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; but there is not yet general consensus on the detailed microscopic mechanisms, and this is still now a field of active research,.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Blanter, I.S. Golovin, H. Neuhäuser H.-R. Sinning ''Internal Friction in Metallic Materials. A Handbook'' (Springer, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Schoeck, "Bordoni relaxation in kink-chains", ''Acta Materialia'' '''58''', 2898 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bordoni also contributed to developing the instrumentation for anelastic experiments on resonanting samples,&lt;ref&gt;P.G. Bordoni, "Metodo elettroacustico per ricerche sperimentali sulla elasticità", ''Nuovo Cimento'' '''4''', 177 (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; and to other aspects of anelasticity. In the 1980s he turned to the study of the interaction of dislocations with [[Interstitial compound|interstitial]] hydrogen, acting as a mobile point defect, and hence on reliable methods for electrolytically introducing H in the samples, controlling the occurrence of [[hydride]] precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;P.G. Bordoni and G. Fusco "On the temporary formation of beta-phase in the cathodization of Palladium", ''Il Nuovo Cimento'' '''4''', 55 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11547">The '''Pomeranchuk Instability''' is an instability in the shape of the [[Fermi surface]] of a material with interacting [[fermion]]s, causing [[Lev Landau|Landau]]’s [[Fermi liquid theory]] to break down. It occurs when a Landau parameter in Fermi liquid theory has a sufficiently negative value, causing deformations of the Fermi surface to be energetically favourable. It is named after the [[USSR|Soviet]] physicist [[Isaak Pomeranchuk]].

==Fermi liquids and Landau parameters==

In a [[Fermi liquid theory|Fermi liquid]], [[Renormalization|renormalized]] single [[electron]] [[Propagator|propagators]] (ignoring [[Spin (physics)|spin]]) are
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{Z}{k_0 -\epsilon_{\vec{k}} + i\eta \sgn(k_0)} = G_{}(K)&lt;/math&gt;,
where capital momentum letters denote [[Four-vector|four vectors]] &lt;math&gt;K = (k_0, \vec{k})&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Fermi surface]] has zero energy.&lt;ref name="landafshitz" /&gt; The poles of &lt;math&gt;G(K)&lt;/math&gt; determine the [[quasiparticle]] energy-momentum [[dispersion relation]]. One can define the four-point vertex function &lt;math&gt;\Gamma _{(K_3, K_4 ; K_1, K_2)}&lt;/math&gt; as the diagram with two incoming electrons of momentum &lt;math&gt;K_1, K_2&lt;/math&gt; and two outgoing electrons of momentum &lt;math&gt;K_3, K_4&lt;/math&gt; and amputated external lines: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \prod_{i=1}^2 d X_i e^{iK_i X_i}\prod_{i=3}^4 dX_i e^{-iK_i X_i} \langle T \psi_{}^{\dagger}(X_3)\psi_{}^{\dagger}(X_4) \psi_{}(X_1) \rangle \psi_{}(X_2) \rangle =&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt; =(2\pi)^8 \delta(K_1-K_3)\delta(K_2-K_4) G(K_1) G(K_2) - (2\pi)^8 \delta(K_1-K_4)\delta(K_2-K_3) G(K_1) G(K_2) + &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt; + (2\pi)^4 \delta({K_1+K_2-K_3-K_4}) G(K_1)G(K_2)G(K_3)G(K_4) i\Gamma_{(K_3, K_4 ; K_1, K_2)} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The 2-particle-irreducible &lt;math&gt;\tilde\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of diagrams contributing to &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; that cannot be disconnected after cutting two electron propagators. When &lt;math&gt;K' := K_1-K_3 := (k'_0, \vec {k'})&lt;/math&gt; is very small (the regime of interest here), the ''T''-channel becomes dominant over the ''S'' and ''U'' channels, so the [[Dyson series|Dyson equation]] gives 

&lt;math&gt; \Gamma_{K_3, K_4; K_1, K_2} = \tilde\Gamma_{K_3, K_4; K_1, K_2} - i  \sum_Q \tilde\Gamma _ {K_3, Q+K';K_1,Q} G(Q)G(Q+K') \Gamma_{Q,K_4; Q+K', K_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, matrix manipulations (treating these quantities like infinite matrices with indices labelled by pairs &lt;math&gt;(K_1, K_3)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(K_2, K_4)&lt;/math&gt;) show&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^\omega_{K_1, K_2} := \lim_{k'\to\ 0} \lim_{k'/\omega' \to 0} \Gamma_{K_3, K_4; K_1, K_2}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;is non-singular and satisfies matrix equation &lt;math&gt;\Gamma= ((\Gamma^\omega)^{-1} - L)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;L_{Q''+K'', Q'-K'; Q'', Q'} := -i\delta_{Q'',Q'}\delta_{K'',K'}G(Q')G(K'+Q')&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="voskresensky" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The normalized Landau parameter is defined as &lt;math&gt;f_{kk'} =  Z^2 N \Gamma^\omega ( (\epsilon_{\rm F}, \vec{k}) , (\epsilon_{\rm F}, \vec{k'}))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N= \frac{p_{\rm F} m^*_{\rm F}}{\pi^2}&lt;/math&gt; is Fermi surface density of states. Energy is approximated by the functional 

&lt;math&gt; E = \sum_{\vec{k}} \epsilon_{\vec{k}} \delta n_{\vec{k}} + \sum_{\vec{k},\vec{k'}}{ \frac{1}{2NV}f_{\vec{k}\vec{k'}} \delta n_{\vec{k}} \delta n_\vec{k'} }&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{\vec{k}} = v_{\rm F}(|\vec{k}|-p_{\rm F})&lt;/math&gt; for momenta &lt;math&gt;\vec{k}&lt;/math&gt; near the [[Fermi energy|Fermi momentum]] &lt;math&gt;p_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt;.
==Pomeranchuk stability criterion==

In a 3D isotropic Fermi liquid, consider small density fluctuations &lt;math&gt;\delta n_k = \Theta(|k|-p_{\rm F}) - \Theta(|k|-p_{\rm F}'(\hat{k})) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p_{\rm F}'(\hat{k}) = \sum_{l=0}^\infty Y_{l,m}(\hat{k}) \delta \phi_{lm}(\hat{k})&lt;/math&gt; and the infinitesimal function &lt;math&gt;\delta \phi_{lm}(\hat{k})&lt;/math&gt; parametrises the fluctuation (&lt;math&gt;Y_{l,m}&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[spherical harmonics]]). Plugging this into the energy functional, and assuming &lt;math&gt;\delta \phi_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than &lt;math&gt;p_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k} \epsilon_k \delta n_k = \frac{2}{( 2 \pi)^3}\int d^2 \hat{k} \int_{p_{\rm F}}^{p_{\rm F}'(\hat{k})} v_{\rm F} (p'-p_{\rm F}) p'^2 d p' = \frac{p_{\rm F}^2 v_{\rm F}}{(2 \pi)^3} \sum_{lm} (\delta \phi_{lm})^2 \frac{4 \pi}{2l+1} \frac{ (l+m)!}{(l-m)!}  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k, k'} f_{k k'} \delta n_k \delta n_{k'} = \frac{2 p_{\rm F}^4}{(2\pi)^6 } \int d^2 \hat{k} d^2 \hat{k'} (p_{\rm F}'(\hat{k})-p_{\rm F})(p_{\rm F}'(\hat{k'})_{\rm F})f_{p_{\rm F} \hat{k}, p_{\rm F} \hat{k'}}&lt;/math&gt;
gives
:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{p_{\rm F}^2 v_{\rm F}}{2 (\pi)^2} \sum_{lm} (\delta \phi_{lm})^2 \frac{(l+m)!}{(2l+1)(l-m)!}\left( 1+ \frac{f_l}{2l+1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;f_{p_{\rm F} \hat{k}, p_{\rm F} \hat{k'}} = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} P_l(\hat{k} \cdot \hat{k'})f_l &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_l&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;-th [[Legendre polynomials|Legendre polynomial]].&lt;ref name="pomeranchuk" /&gt;Positive definite energy functional requires the Pomeranchuk stability criterion, &lt;math&gt;f_l &gt;-(2l+1)&lt;/math&gt;; otherwise the Fermi surface distortion &lt;math&gt;\delta \phi_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; will grow unbounded until the model breaks down in what is called the Pomeranchuk instability.

In 2D, a similar analysis, with circular wave fluctuations &lt;math&gt; \propto e^{i l \theta}&lt;/math&gt; instead of spherical harmonics and [[Chebyshev polynomials]] instead of Legendre polynomials, shows the Pomeranchuk constraint to be &lt;math&gt;f_l &gt; -1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="reidy" /&gt; In non-isotropic materials, the same qualitative result is true - for sufficiently negative Landau parameters, the Fermi surface is spontaneously destroyed with unstable fluctuations.

The point at which &lt;math&gt;F_l = - (2l+1)&lt;/math&gt; is of much theoretical interest as it indicates a [[quantum phase transition]] from a Fermi liquid to a different state of matter, and above zero temperature a quantum critical state exists.&lt;ref name="critical point" /&gt;
===Physical quantities with manifest Pomeranchuk criterion===

Many physical quantities in Fermi liquid theory are simple expressions of components of Landau parameters. A few standard ones are listed here; they diverge or become unphysical beyond the quantum critical point.&lt;ref name="baym pethick"/&gt;

Isothermal [[compressibility]]: &lt;math&gt;\kappa = -\frac{1}{V} \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} =\frac{N/n^2}{1+f_0} &lt;/math&gt;

[[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|Effective mass]]: &lt;math&gt;m^* = \frac{p_{\rm F}}{v_{\rm F}} = m(1+f_1/3)&lt;/math&gt;

Speed of first sound: &lt;math&gt;C = \sqrt{\frac{p_{\rm F}^2 (1+ f_0)}{m^2( 3+f_1)}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Unstable zero sound modes==

[[Zero sound]] describes how the localized fluctuations of the momentum density function &lt;math&gt;\delta n_k&lt;/math&gt; propagate through space and time.&lt;ref name="landafshitz"/&gt; Just as the quasiparticle dispersion is given by the pole of the one-particle propagator, the zero sound dispersion relation is given by the pole of the T-channel of the vertex function &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(K_3, K_4; K_1, K_2)&lt;/math&gt; near small &lt;math&gt;K_1-K_3&lt;/math&gt;. Physically, this describes the propagation of an electron hole pair, which is responsible for the fluctuations in &lt;math&gt;\delta n_k&lt;/math&gt;. 
From the relation &lt;math&gt;\Gamma= ((\Gamma^\omega)^{-1} - L)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and ignoring the contributions of &lt;math&gt;f_\ell&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\ell &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the zero sound spectrum is given by the four-vectors &lt;math&gt;K' = (\omega(\vec{k'}), \vec{k'})&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\frac{Z^2 N}{f_0}  =-i \sum_Q G(Q+K')G(Q+K)&lt;/math&gt;, or

&lt;math&gt;\frac{-1}{f_0} = \Phi ( s,x) := \frac{(s-x/2)^2-1}{4x} \ln \frac{(s-x/2)+1}{(s-x/2)-1} -\frac{(s+x/2)^2 -1}{4x} \ln \frac{(s+x/2)+1}{(s+x/2)-1} +\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s = \frac{\omega(\vec{k})}{|\vec{k}|p_{\rm F}} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x = \frac{|k|}{p_{\rm F}}&lt;/math&gt;. 

When &lt;math&gt;f_0&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, for each real &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; there is a real solution for &lt;math&gt;s(x)&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to a real zero sound dispersion relation of oscillatory waves. 
When &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, for each real &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; there is a pure imaginary solution for &lt;math&gt;s(x)&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to an exponential change in zero sound amplitude over time. For &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;f_0&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Im(s(x))&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; at all real &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, so amplitude is damped. But for &lt;math&gt;-1 &gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Im(s(x))&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for sufficiently small &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, implying exponential explosion of any low-momentum zero sound fluctuation. This is a manifestation of the Pomeranchuk instability.&lt;ref name="voskresensky"/&gt;
==Nematic phase transition==

Pomeranchuk instabilities at &lt;math&gt;l=1&lt;/math&gt; are shown to not exist in non-relativistic systems by &lt;ref name="l=1"/&gt;. However, instabilities at &lt;math&gt;l=2&lt;/math&gt; have interesting solid state applications. From the form of spherical harmonics &lt;math&gt;Y_{2,m} (\theta, \phi) &lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;e^{2i\theta}&lt;/math&gt; in 2d), the Fermi surface is distorted into an ellipsoid (or ellipse).Specifically, in 2d, the quadrupole moment order parameter &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tilde{Q}(q) = \sum_k e^{2i \theta_q} \psi^{\dagger}_{k+q} \psi_k &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;has nonzero [[vacuum expectation value]] in the &lt;math&gt;l=2&lt;/math&gt; Pomeranchuk instability. The Fermi surface has eccentricity &lt;math&gt;|\langle \tilde{Q}(0) \rangle|&lt;/math&gt; and spontaneous major axis orientation &lt;math&gt;\theta =\arg(\langle \tilde{Q}(0) \rangle)&lt;/math&gt;. Gradual spatial variation in &lt;math&gt;\theta(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt; forms gapless [[Goldstone boson|Goldstone modes]], forming a nematic liquid statistically analogous to a liquid crystal. Oganesyan et al.'s analysis &lt;ref name="oganesyan" /&gt; of a model interaction between quadrupole moments predicts damped zero sound fluctuations of the quadrupole moment condensate for waves oblique to the ellipse axes. 

The 2d square tight-binding Hubbard Hamiltonian with next-to-nearest neighbour interaction has been found by Halboth and Metzner&lt;ref name="rg" /&gt; to display instability in susceptibility of ''d''-wave fluctuations under [[renormalization group]] flow. Thus, the Pomeranchuk instability is suspected to explain the experimentally measured anisotropy in [[cuprate superconductor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s such as LSCO and [[Yttrium barium copper oxide|YBCO]].&lt;ref name="lsco" /&gt;

'''Raja Ramanna''' (28 January 1928&amp;nbsp;– 24 September 2004) was an [[People of India|Indian]] [[Physics|physicist]] who is best known for his role in [[India and weapons of mass destruction|India's nuclear program]] during its early stages.

Having joined the [[India and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear program]] in 1964, Ramanna worked under [[Homi Jehangir Bhabha]], and later became the director of this program in 1967. Ramanna expanded and supervised scientific research on [[nuclear weapons]] and was the first directing officer of the small team of scientists that supervised and carried out the [[nuclear testing|test]] of the nuclear device, under the codename ''[[Smiling Buddha]]'', in 1974.&lt;ref name="Ramanna"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.barc.gov.in/leaders/rammana.html | title=Dr. Ramanna | publisher=BARC: GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, DEPARTMENT OF  ATOMIC ENERGY, BABHA ATOMIC RESEARCH CENTRE. | work=BARC | accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramanna was associated with and directed [[India and weapons of mass destruction|India's nuclear program]] for more than four decades, and also initiated industrial defence programmes for the [[Indian Armed Forces]]. He was a recipient of Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian decoration, in honour of his services to build India's nuclear programme. Ramanna died in [[Mumbai]] in 2004 at the age of 79.&lt;ref name="condolence "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dae.nic.in/?q=node/223 | title=Dr. Raja Ramanna's death news. | publisher=Government of India- Department of Atomic Energy | accessdate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

Raja Ramanna was born in beginning of 1925 to Rukmini and Ramanna in Tumkur, in the [[princely state]] of Mysore. The parents having recognised his talent for music early in life were instrumental in introducing him to classical European music.  Beginning his studies at [[Bishop Cotton Boys School|Bishop Cotton Boys' School]], [[Bangalore]], where he mostly studied literature and classical music, he later attended [[Madras Christian College]] and resided at [[St.Thomas's Hall]] where he continued his interests in arts and literature but soon shifted back to physics. At Madras Christian College, Ramanna obtained a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] in [[Physics]] and gained a [[Bachelor of science|Ba]] degree in Classical music in 1947.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 1947 Ramanna went on to attend [[University of Mumbai|Bombay University]] where he gained his [[Master of Science|MSc]] in Physics, followed by [[Master of Music|M.Mus.]] in [[Music theory]]. Ramanna was awarded a [[Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan|Commonwealth Scholarship]], and travelled to Great Britain in 1952 to complete his doctorate. Ramanna attended [[University of London|London University]]'s [[King's College London|King's College]] and enrolled in a doctoral programme there. In 1954, Raja Ramanna obtained a PhD in [[Nuclear Physics]] and also a [[Royal Schools of Music|LRSM]] from King's College London. In the United Kingdom, Ramanna was invited to do his research at the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] (AERE) where he gained expertise in nuclear fuel cycles and reactor designing. While in the UK, Ramanna continued his interest in European music and [[Western philosophy]], attending Opera and Orchestra performances every week.

European music and philosophy remained a lifelong passion for Ramanna, and after returning to India, Ramanna accomplished himself by performing classical European music at many public concerts in India and abroad. Ramannad also had a keen ear for Indian classical music. His musical talents also received wide appreciation in neighbouring Pakistan. In 1956, Ramanna was invited by the [[National College of Arts]] and [[National Academy of Performing Arts]] to perform and lecture on the classical piano with a live ensemble and received jubilant praise and honour for his performance.

==Indian nuclear programme==

{{See also|Pokhran-I|Pokhran-II}}

Ramanna was one of the secretive personalities surrounding the [[Indian nuclear programme]], a programme started and envisioned by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] in 1947, and being directed by [[Homi J. Bhabha]]. After his doctorate in physics, Ramanna returned in 1954 to India, where he joined the senior technical staff of [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] (BARC), where he worked under Homi J. Bhabha in classified nuclear weapons projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iloveindia.com/indian-heroes/raja-ramanna.html | title=Raja Ramanna Biography | accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Bhaba dedicated to develop this programme, Ramanna inducted by to choose the preferable nuclear test site to carry out the weapon-testing experiments. The exact dates are unknown, but Ramanna chose and began the underground construction of nuclear test site at an Indian Army base, the Pokhran Test Range (PTR). After the disastrous death of Homi Bhaba, Ramanna was immediately elevated to become the directing officer of this programme. Ramanna, serving as the CDO of BARC, began to take initiate to develop the first nuclear weapon.  At BARC, the initial designing of nuclear weapon was completed under his guidance and the necessary nuclear weapons' explosive material for this weapon was completed under Ramanna by 1970. As the first nuclear device was completed and developed under his guidance, Ramanna went to [[Indian Prime Minister's Office]], where he had notified [[Indian Prime Minister|Indian premier]] [[Indira Gandhi]] about the successful development of the nuclear device.

In 1974, Ramanna and other officials of the BARC verbally notified Indira Gandhi that India was ready to conduct the test of its small miniature nuclear device. Indira Gandhi verbally gave permission to Ramanna to carry out the test, and preparation was taken under Ramanna. Ramanna immediately travelled to [[Pokhran]] to pay a visit to the nuclear site that was constructed under his guidance. Preparations were completed under extreme secrecy and the first nuclear device was flown from Trombay to Pokhran Test Range with Ramanna. Ramanna and his team installed the nuclear device in the nuclear test site and necessary preparations were done before Indira Gandhi's visit to his site. In the morning in May 1974, Ramanna conducted the first test of a small nuclear device under codename ''[[Smiling Buddha]]''. Pictures of Indira Gandhi inspecting the aftermath of the explosion site were flashed on front pages of newspapers in India and the world over with Ramanna and Dr. [[Homi Sethna]], India's top nuclear scientist duo, by her side. Following this achievement, Ramanna gained international fame and was also honoured with India's second highest civilian award in 1975 by the Indira Gandhi's administration.

In 1978, Saddam Hussein approached Ramanna for help to build an Iraqi nuclear bomb. The offer came while Ramanna was in Baghdad for a week as Saddam's personal guest. He was given a tour of the capital and Iraq's main nuclear facility at Tuwaitha. At the end of the trip, Saddam invited the scientist to his office and told him: "You have done enough for your country; don't go back. Stay here and take over our nuclear programme. I will pay you whatever you want." &lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | last=Pandya | first=Haresh | date=2 October 2004 | title=Raja Ramanna Biography | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/oct/01/guardianobituaries.obituaries | work=The Guardian | location=London | accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanna was shocked and scared by the Iraqi proposal. He reportedly could not sleep that night, worried that he might never see his homeland again. He took the next flight out.

Later in his career, Ramanna advocated for the strict policies to prevent nuclear proliferation. Ramanna also travelled to Pakistan, where he attended the annual [[International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics|International Physics Conference]] to deliver a lecture on nuclear physics, notably lectures on [[nuclear force]]. Ramanna began lobbying for peace process between India and Pakistan, and was a leading force to prevent nuclear escalation in the [[South Asia|region]]. Later in the 1980s and 1990s, Ramanna served as Director General of the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO) and as scientific adviser to the Defence Minister of India in 2000. He was a member of the [[Defence Research &amp; Development Service]] (DRDS). Ramanna also joined the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] in 1984 where he served as the President of the 30th General Conference of the IAEA.

==Interests==

A multi-faceted personality, Ramanna was a gifted musician, and could play the piano as dextrously as he could speak about atomic energy. Music was close to his heart, and one of the two books he wrote was '''The Structure of Music in Raga And Western Systems''' (1993). The other was his autobiography, entitled '''Years of Pilgrimage''' (1991).&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

==Minister of State==

In 1990, Ramanna was made Union minister of State for defence by [[V.P. Singh]] administration. He was a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha from 1997 to 2003. Dr. Ramanna was closely associated with the I.I.T. Bombay, having been chairman of the board of Governors for three consecutive terms from 1975 to 1984. In 2000, Ramanna was also the first director of [[National Institute of Advanced Studies]], [[Bangalore]].

{{Star formation}}
'''Star formation''' is the process by which dense regions within [[molecular cloud]]s in [[&lt;!--Interstellar medium|The "medium" is present further soon.--&gt;interstellar space]], sometimes referred to as "stellar nurseries" or "[[star]]-forming regions", [[Jeans instability|collapse]] and form [[star]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Formation of Stars|author1=Stahler, S. W.  |author2=Palla, F. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = Wiley-VCH|year = 2004|isbn = 3-527-40559-3|location = Weinheim}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a branch of [[astronomy]], star formation includes the study of the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) and [[giant molecular cloud]]s (GMC) as precursors to the star formation process, and the study of [[protostar]]s and [[young stellar object]]s as its immediate products.  It is closely related to [[planet formation]], another branch of [[astronomy]].  Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of [[binary star]]s and the [[initial mass function]].

===Interstellar clouds===
A [[spiral galaxy]] like the Milky Way contains [[star]]s, [[stellar remnant]]s, and a diffuse [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) of gas and dust. The interstellar medium consists of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; particles per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and is typically composed of roughly 70% [[hydrogen]] by mass, with most of the remaining gas consisting of [[helium]]. This medium has been chemically enriched by trace amounts of [[Metallicity|heavier elements]] that were ejected from stars as they passed beyond the end of their [[main sequence]] lifetime. Higher density regions of the interstellar medium form clouds, or ''[[nebula|diffuse nebulae]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=C.

In the dense nebulae where stars are produced, much of the hydrogen is in the molecular (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) form, so these nebulae are called [[molecular cloud]]s.&lt;ref name=prialnik /&gt; Observations indicate that the coldest clouds tend to form low-mass stars, observed first in the infrared inside the clouds, then in visible light at their surface when the clouds dissipate, while giant molecular clouds, which are generally warmer, produce stars of all masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=James | last=Lequeux | title=Birth, Evolution and Death of Stars | publisher=World Scientific | date=2013 | isbn=978-981-4508-77-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These giant molecular clouds have typical densities of 100 particles per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, diameters of {{convert|100|ly|km|lk=on}}, masses of up to 6&amp;nbsp;million [[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=y}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

===Cloud collapse===
An interstellar cloud of gas will remain in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] as long as the [[kinetic energy]] of the gas [[pressure]] is in balance with the [[potential energy]] of the internal [[gravitational force]]. Mathematically this is expressed using the [[virial theorem]], which states that,  to maintain equilibrium, the gravitational potential energy must equal twice the internal thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a cloud is massive enough that the gas pressure is insufficient to support it, the cloud will undergo [[gravitational collapse]]. The mass above which a cloud will undergo such collapse is called the [[Jeans mass]]. The Jeans mass depends on the temperature and density of the cloud, but is typically thousands to tens of thousands of solar masses.&lt;ref name=prialnik /&gt; This coincides with the typical mass of an [[open cluster]] of stars, which is the end product of a collapsing cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=E. | last=Battaner

In ''triggered star formation'', one of several events might occur to compress a molecular cloud and initiate its [[gravitational collapse]]. Molecular clouds may collide with each other, or a nearby [[supernova]] explosion can be a trigger, sending [[Shock wave|shocked]] matter into the cloud at very high speeds.&lt;ref name=prialnik /&gt; (The resulting new stars may themselves soon produce supernovae, producing [[SSPSF model|self-propagating star formation]].)  Alternatively, [[Interacting galaxy|galactic collisions]] can trigger massive [[starburst (astronomy)|starburst]]s of star formation as the gas clouds in each galaxy are compressed and agitated by [[galactic tide|tidal forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

A [[supermassive black hole]] at the core of a galaxy may serve to regulate the rate of star formation in a galactic nucleus. A black hole that is accreting infalling matter can become [[Active galactic nucleus|active]], emitting a strong wind through a collimated [[relativistic jet]]. This can limit further star formation. Massive black holes ejecting radio-frequency-emitting particles at near-light speed can also block the formation of new stars in aging galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As it collapses, a molecular cloud breaks into smaller and smaller pieces in a hierarchical manner, until the fragments reach stellar mass. In each of these fragments, the collapsing gas radiates away the energy gained by the release of [[gravitational]] [[potential energy]].  As the density increases, the fragments become opaque and are thus less efficient at radiating away their energy. This raises the temperature of the cloud and inhibits further fragmentation. The fragments now condense into rotating spheres of gas that serve as stellar embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Complicating this picture of a collapsing cloud are the effects of [[turbulence]], macroscopic flows, [[rotation]], [[magnetic fields]] and the cloud geometry. Both rotation and magnetic fields can hinder the collapse of a cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A protostellar cloud will continue to collapse as long as the gravitational binding energy can be eliminated. This excess energy is primarily lost through radiation. However, the collapsing cloud will eventually become opaque to its own radiation, and the energy must be removed through some other means. The dust within the cloud becomes heated to temperatures of {{nowrap|60–100 K}}, and these particles radiate at wavelengths in the far infrared where the cloud is transparent. Thus the dust mediates the further collapse of the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During the collapse, the density of the cloud increases towards the center and thus the middle region becomes optically opaque first. This occurs when the density is about {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; g / cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A core region, called the First Hydrostatic Core, forms where the collapse is essentially halted. It continues to increase in temperature as determined by the virial theorem. The gas falling toward this opaque region collides with it and creates shock waves that further heat the core.&lt;ref name=larson/&gt;

The combination of convection within the protostar and radiation from its exterior allow the star to contract further.&lt;ref name=larson/&gt; This continues until the gas is hot enough for the internal [[pressure]] to support the protostar against further gravitational collapse—a state called [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. When this accretion phase is nearly complete, the resulting object is known as a [[protostar]].&lt;ref name=prialnik /&gt;
[[Image:N11 (Hubble).jpg|thumb|right| N11, part of a complex network of gas clouds and star clusters within our neighbouring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud.]]
Accretion of material onto the protostar continues partially from the newly formed [[circumstellar disc]]. When the density and temperature are high enough, [[deuterium burning|deuterium fusion]] begins, and the outward [[radiation pressure|pressure]] of the resultant radiation slows (but does not stop) the collapse. Material comprising the cloud continues to "rain" onto the [[protostar]]. In this stage bipolar jets are produced called [[Herbig-Haro objects]]. This is probably the means by which excess [[angular momentum]] of the infalling material is expelled, allowing the star to continue to form.

When the surrounding gas and dust envelope disperses and accretion process stops, the star is considered a [[pre–main sequence star]] (PMS star). The energy source of these objects is gravitational contraction, as opposed to hydrogen burning in main sequence stars. The PMS star follows a [[Hayashi track]] on the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram|Hertzsprung–Russell (H–R) diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = C. Hayashi | title=Stellar evolution in early phases of gravitational contraction | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan | date=1961 | volume=13 | pages=450–452 | bibcode=1961PASJ...13..450H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contraction will proceed until the [[Hayashi limit]] is reached, and thereafter contraction will continue on a [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism|Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale]] with the temperature remaining stable. Stars with less than {{Solar mass|0.5}} thereafter join the main sequence. For more massive PMS stars, at the end of the Hayashi track they will slowly collapse in near hydrostatic equilibrium, following the [[Henyey track]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = L. G. Henyey | author2 = R. Lelevier | author3 = R. D.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, [[hydrogen]] begins to fuse in the core of the star, and the rest of the enveloping material is cleared away. This ends the protostellar phase and begins the star's [[main sequence]] phase on the H–R diagram.

The stages of the process are well defined in stars with masses around {{Solar mass|1}} or less. In high mass stars, the length of the star formation process is comparable to the other timescales of their evolution, much shorter, and the process is not so well defined. The later evolution of stars are studied in [[stellar evolution]].

The structure of the molecular cloud and the effects of the protostar can be observed in near-IR [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] maps (where the number of stars are counted per unit area and compared to a nearby zero extinction area of sky), continuum dust emission and [[rotational transition]]s of [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] and other molecules; these last two are observed in the millimeter and [[radio astronomy|submillimeter]] range. The radiation from the protostar and early star has to be observed in [[infrared|infrared astronomy]] wavelengths, as the [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] caused by the rest of the cloud in which the star is forming is usually too big to allow us to observe it in the visual part of the spectrum. This presents considerable difficulties as the Earth's atmosphere is almost entirely opaque from 20μm to 850μm, with narrow windows at 200μm and 450μm. Even outside this range, atmospheric subtraction techniques must be used.

Stars of different masses are thought to form by slightly different mechanisms.  The theory of low-mass star formation, which is well-supported by a plethora of observations, suggests that low-mass stars form by the gravitational collapse of rotating density enhancements within molecular clouds.  As described above, the collapse of a rotating cloud of gas and dust leads to the formation of an accretion disk through which matter is channeled onto a central protostar.  For stars with masses higher than about {{Solar mass|8}}, however, the mechanism of star formation is not well understood.

Massive stars emit copious quantities of radiation which pushes against infalling material.  In the past, it was thought that this [[radiation pressure]] might be substantial enough to halt accretion onto the massive protostar and prevent the formation of stars with masses more than a few tens of solar masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = M. G. Wolfire | author2 = J. P. Cassinelli | title = Conditions for the formation of massive stars | journal = Astrophysical Journal | date = 1987 | volume = 319 | issue = 1 | pages = 850–867 | bibcode = 1987ApJ...319..850W  | doi = 10.1086/165503}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent theoretical work has shown that the production of a jet and outflow clears a cavity through which much of the radiation from a massive protostar can escape without hindering accretion through the disk and onto the protostar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = C.

There is mounting evidence that at least some massive protostars are indeed surrounded by accretion disks.  Several other theories of massive star formation remain to be tested observationally.  Of these, perhaps the most prominent is the theory of competitive accretion, which suggests that massive protostars are "seeded" by low-mass protostars which compete with other protostars to draw in matter from the entire parent molecular cloud, instead of simply from a small local region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = I.

The '''sulfur–iodine cycle''' (S–I cycle) is a three-step [[thermochemical cycle]] used to [[Hydrogen production|produce hydrogen]].

The S–I cycle consists of three [[chemical reaction]]s whose net reactant is water and whose net products are [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. All other chemicals are recycled. The S–I process requires an efficient source of heat.

The three reactions that produce hydrogen are as follows:
#[[Iodine|I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{Overset|heat|→}} 2 [[Hydroiodic acid|HI]] + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (120&amp;nbsp;°C); [[Bunsen reaction]]
#*The HI is then separated by [[distillation]] or liquid/liquid gravitic separation.
#2 [[Sulfuric acid#Sulfur-iodine cycle|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] {{Overset|heat|→}} 2 [[Sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2 [[Water (molecule)|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] + [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] ({{Convert|830|C|F}})
#*The water, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and residual H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; must be separated from the oxygen byproduct by condensation.
#2 HI → I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + [[Hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (450&amp;nbsp;°C)
#*Iodine and any accompanying water or SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are separated by [[condensation]], and the hydrogen product remains as a gas.
:
: Net reaction: 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The [[sulfur]] and [[iodine]] compounds are recovered and reused, hence the consideration of the process as a cycle. This S–I process is a chemical [[heat engine]]. Heat enters the cycle in high-temperature [[endothermic]] chemical reactions 2 and 3, and heat exits the cycle in the low-temperature [[exothermic]] reaction 1. The difference between the heat entering and leaving the cycle exits the cycle in the form of the [[heat of combustion]] of the hydrogen produced.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The characteristics of the S–I process can be described as follows:
* All fluid (liquids, gases) process, therefore well suited for continuous operation;
* High utilization of heat predicted (about 50%), but very high temperatures required (at least 850&amp;nbsp;°C);
* Completely closed system without byproducts or effluents (besides hydrogen and oxygen);
* Corrosive reagents used as intermediaries (iodine, sulfur dioxide, hydriodic acid, sulfuric acid); therefore, advanced materials needed for construction of process apparatus;
* Suitable for application with solar, nuclear, and hybrid (e.g., solar-fossil) sources of heat;
* More developed than competitive thermochemical processes (but still requiring significant development to be feasible on large scale).

==Research==
The S–I cycle was invented at [[General Atomics]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Besenbruch, G. 1982. General Atomic sulfur iodine thermochemical water-splitting process. Proceedings of the American Chemical Society, Div. Pet. Chem., 27(1):48-53.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) has conducted successful experiments with the S–I cycle in the Helium cooled [[High Temperature Test Reactor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://httr.jaea.go.jp/eng/index.html |title=HTTR High Temperature engineering Test Reactor |publisher=Httr.jaea.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://smr.inl.gov/Document.ashx?path=DOCS%2FGCR-Int%2FNHDDELDER.pdf.

(The Japanese refer to the cycle as the IS cycle.) Plans have been made to test larger-scale automated systems for hydrogen production. Under an International Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (INERI) agreement, the French [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique|CEA]], General Atomics and [[Sandia National Laboratories]] are jointly developing the sulfur-iodine process. Additional research is taking place at the [[Idaho National Laboratory]], in Canada, Korea and Italy.

===Material challenge===
The S–I cycle involves operations with corrosive chemicals at temperatures up to about {{convert|1000|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. The selection of materials with sufficient corrosion resistance under the process conditions is of key importance to the economic viability of this process. The materials suggested include the following classes: refractory metals, reactive metals, [[superalloys]], ceramics, polymers, and coatings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review05/pd27_pickard.pdf Paul Pickard, Sulfur-Iodine Thermochemical Cycle 2005 DOE Hydrogen Program Review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=B. |last1=Wonga |first2=R.

Recent research on scaled prototyping suggests that new tantalum surface technologies may be a technically and economically feasible way to make larger scale installations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiche-ned.org/conferences/aiche2007fall/Session_566/AICHE2007Fall-566a-Drake.pdf T.

==Hydrogen economy==

The sulfur-iodine cycle has been proposed as a way to supply hydrogen for a [[Hydrogen economy|hydrogen-based economy]]. It does not require [[hydrocarbons]] like current methods of [[steam reforming]] but requires heat from combustion, nuclear reactions, or solar heat concentrators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3620">A '''teardrop trailer''' is an [[aerodynamically]] shaped [[semi-trailer]] with a curved-roof that differs in shape from the traditional rectangularly shaped trailer.  The trailer is meant to be paired with a compatibly designed [[tractor unit]] leading to greater fuel efficiency of the [[tractor-trailer]] combination. As such, the "teardrop" phrase refers to the entire combination, not just the trailer.  The curved shape of the roof decreases [[aerodynamic drag]] by smoothing airflow over the top, thus improving [[fuel efficiency]].

One operator has reported the trailers save 2% in fuel in service that included significant low speed delivery operation and 5% in higher speed long-haul operation.{{r|hdt1}}

Another factor improving airflow is the gap between the tractor and trailer is minimized to lessen the amount of [[turbulence]] created by air flowing into the gap.{{r|hdt1}}

Teardrop trailers are only available in the [[United Kingdom]] and manufactured by one company, Don-Bur Trailers &amp; Bodies Ltd which has [[patented]] the design. The manufacturer claims they can save 11.3% in fuel.{{r|hdt1}}

The design echos streamlined shapes used in [[teardrop hull|submarines]], [[fastback|automobiles]] and [[teardrop trailer|camping trailers]].  The first streamlined car was the [[Rumpler Tropfenwagen|Tropfenwagen]] introduced in 1921, named after its teardrop shape (the literal translation from German is "drop car").

A study of trucking fleets in [[North American]] found that improving trailer aerodynamics was the least used method for improving fuel efficiency. Improving tractor aerodynamics and using low [[rolling resistance]] tires were adopted at much higher rates.{{r|hdt2}}

==Adoption==
The trailers have been used in the [[United Kingdom]] for several years by various operators. [[Deutsche Post DHL]] operates over 1,100 in the UK and was the first operator in continental Europe; it announced in 2014 that it would utilize the trailers in [[France]] and [[Germany]].{{r|dhl}}

In [[inorganic chemistry]], a '''ternary compound''' is a compound containing three different elements. An example is [[sodium phosphate]], Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The sodium ion has a charge of 1+ and the phosphate ion has a charge of 3-. Therefore, three sodium ions are needed to balance the charge of one phosphate ion. Another example of a ternary compound is [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). In naming and writing the formulae for ternary compounds, rules are similar to binary compounds.

According to [[Rustum Roy]] and Olaf Müller,&lt;ref name=RROM&gt;[[Rustum Roy]] &amp; Olaf Müller (1974) ''The Major Ternary Structural Families'', Springer-Verlag {{ISBN| 9780387064307}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the chemistry of the entire mineral world informs us that ''chemical'' complexity can easily be accommodated within structural simplicity." The example of [[zircon]] is cited, where various metal atoms are replaced in the same [[crystal structure]]. "The structural entity ... remains ternary in character and is able to accommodate an enormous range of chemical elements." The great variety of ternary compounds is therefore reduced to relatively few structures: "By dealing with approximately ten ternary structural groupings we can cover the most important structures of science and technology specific to the non-metallics world. It is a remarkable instance of nature's [[simplexity]]."&lt;ref name =RROM/&gt;{{rp|3,4}}

Letting A and B represent [[Ion#Anions and cations|cations]] and X an anion, these ternary groupings are organized by [[stoichiometric]] types A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ABX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Brackets ([ ]) are used to identify a structure by an enclosed typical ternary compound.

A ternary compound of type A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; may be in the class of [[olivine]], the [[spinel group]], [[phenakite]], [K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;], [&amp;beta;-K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;], or [Ca F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;].

One of type ABX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; may be of the class of [[zircon]], [[scheelite]], [[barite]] or an ordered [[silicon dioxide]] [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]].

In the ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; class of ternary compounds, there are the structures of [[perovskite (structure)]], [[calcium carbonate]], [[pyroxene]]s, [[corundum]] and hexagonal ABX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; types.&lt;ref name=RROM/&gt;{{rp|figure 1,page 3}}

Other ternary compounds are described as crystals of types &lt;math&gt;ABX_2, \ A_2B_2X_7, \ ABX_5, \ A_2BX_6, A_3BX_5 .&lt;/math&gt;

In [[organic chemistry]], the [[carbohydrate]]s and [[carboxylic acid]]s are ternary compounds with carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Other [[organic compound|organic]] ternary compounds replace oxygen with another atom to form [[functional group]]s.

The anion contains [[aluminium]] tetrahedrally surrounded by four [[perchlorate]] groups.  The perchlorate is covalently bonded to the aluminium, but perchlorate is much more well known as an ion.  The covalent bond to aluminium distorts the perchlorate and renders it unstable.&lt;ref name="complex"/&gt;

Related chemicals are the haloperchloroatoaluminates, where there is one perchloro group attached to aluminium, and three halogens such as chlorine (chloroperchloroatoaluminates) or bromine (bromoperchloroatoaluminates).&lt;ref name="Titova1977"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Titova|first=K.

'''Tony Bramley''' is a South Australian [[scuba diver]] and [[environmentalist]] who has campaigned for the protection of the [[sepia apama|giant Australian cuttlefish]] aggregation of northern [[Spencer Gulf]] since it was heavily fished in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Scientists baffled by return of giant cuttlefish|url = http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2014/s4081687.htm|date = 2014-09-05|accessdate = 2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Welcome back giant cuttlefish|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-05-20/welcome-back-giant-cuttlefish/5464518|website = ABC Rural|accessdate = 2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Since 1998 Tony Bramley has promoted marine [[Ecotourism|eco-tourism]] in the upper Spencer Gulf region, particularly on the rocky inshore reefs of the [[Point Lowly]] peninsula, where the cuttlefish gather to breed between May and August each year. As the proprietor of Whyalla Diving Services, Bramley manages a crew of commercial divers and also provisions visiting tourists and marine scientists who visit the region. Bramley has lived in Whyalla since 1979. He grew up in [[Edithburgh]] on Yorke Peninsula, and has spent most of his life on and in the waters of South Australia's two gulfs. Occasionally, Bramley has been involved in animal rescue operations, and once freed a whale which had become entangled in netting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.whyallanewsonline.com.au/story/3054767/life-under-water/|title = A life underwater|last = Lewis|first = Bryn|date = 2015-05-04|work = |access-date = 2015-07-22|via = |newspaper = Whyalla News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tornado intensity''' can be measured by [[In situ#Earth and atmospheric sciences|in situ]] or [[remote sensing]] measurements, but since these are impractical for wide scale use, intensity is usually inferred via [[Proxy (statistics)|proxies]], such as damage. The [[Fujita scale]] and the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]] rate [[tornado]]es by the damage caused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/f-scale.html NOAA: Fujita Tornado Damage Scale]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tornadofacts.net/tornado-scale.php Tornado Damage Scales: Fujita Scale and Enhanced Fujita Scale]&lt;/ref&gt; The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by [[expert elicitation]]) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees and peel some shingles off the roof. an EF5 tornado can rip homes off their foundations and leaving them bare and can even deform large [[skyscraper]]s. The similar [[TORRO scale]] ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. [[Pulse-Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[weather radar|radar]] data, [[photogrammetry]], and ground swirl patterns ([[cycloid]]al marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.

Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track (and longer lived) tornadoes tend to be stronger.&lt;ref name="width/length intensity relationship"&gt;{{cite journal| title = On the Relationship of Tornado Path Length and Width to Intensity| author = Brooks, Harold E.| date = 2004-04-01| journal = Weather and Forecasting: Vol. 19, No. 2|volume = 19| issue = 2| pages = 310–319| doi = 10.1175/1520-0434(2004)019&lt;0310:OTROTP&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path area is of violent intensity; most of the higher intensity is from [[multiple vortex tornado|subvortices]].&lt;ref name="significant tornadoes"&gt;{{cite book |last = Grazulis |first = Thomas P. |title = Significant Tornadoes 1680–1991 |date=July 1993 |publisher = The Tornado Project of Environmental Films |location = St. Johnsbury, Vermont |isbn = 978-1-879362-03-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are EF0 and EF1 (T0 through T3) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strength—less than 1% are violent tornadoes (EF4, T8 or stronger).&lt;ref name="Basic Spotter Guide"/&gt;

== History of tornado intensity measurements ==
[[File:Fujita scale technical.svg|thumb|300px|right|A diagram of the [[Fujita scale]] as it relates to the [[Beaufort scale]] and the [[Mach number]] scale.]]
For many years, before the advent of Doppler radar, scientists had nothing more than educated guesses as to the speed of the winds in a tornado.  The only evidence indicating the wind speeds found in the tornado was the damage left behind by tornadoes which struck populated areas. Some believed they reach {{convert|400|mph|abbr=on}}; others thought they might exceed {{convert|500|mph|abbr=on}}, and perhaps even be [[supersonic]]. One can still find these incorrect guesses in some old (until the 1960s) literature, such as the original Fujita Intensity Scale developed by [[Ted Fujita|Dr. Tetsuya Theodore Fujita]] in the early '70s. However, one can find accounts (e.g. [http://www.stormtrack.org/library/archives/stsep00.htm]; be sure to scroll down) of some remarkable work done in this field by a U.S. Army soldier, Sergeant [[John Park Finley]].

In 1971, [[Ted Fujita|Dr. Tetsuya Theodore Fujita]] introduced the idea for a scale of tornado winds. With the help of colleague [[Allen Pearson]], he created and introduced what came to be called the [[Fujita scale]] in 1973. This is what the F stands for in F1, F2, etc. The scale was based on a relationship between the [[Beaufort scale]] and the [[Mach number]] scale; the low end of F1 on his scale corresponds to the low end of B12 on the Beaufort scale, and the low end of F12 corresponds to the speed of sound at sea level, or Mach 1. In practice, tornadoes are only assigned categories F0 through F5.

The TORRO scale, created by the [[TORRO|Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)]], was developed in 1974 and published a year later. The TORRO scale has 12 levels, which cover a broader range with tighter graduations. It ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. T0-T1 roughly correspond to F0, T2-T3 to F1, and so on. While T10+ would be approximately an F5, the highest tornado rated to date on the TORRO scale was a T8.&lt;ref name="TORRO history"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.torro.org.uk/TORRO/about/history.php| title = A Brief History of TORRO (to 1985)| accessdate = 2006-11-01| last = Meaden| first = Dr. Terence| year = 1985| publisher = [[TORRO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TORRO severe summary"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.torro.org.uk/TORRO/britwxextremes/summary.php| title = British Weather Extremes Summary| accessdate = 2006-11-02| author = Various| publisher = [[TORRO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate as to the usefulness of the TORRO scale over the Fujita scale&amp;mdash;while it may be helpful for statistical purposes to have more levels of tornado strength, often the damage caused could be created by a large range of winds, rendering it hard to narrow the tornado down to a single TORRO scale category.

Research conducted in the late 1980s and 1990s suggested that, even with the implication of the Fujita scale, tornado winds were notoriously overestimated, especially in significant and violent tornadoes. Because of this, in 2006, the [[American Meteorological Society]] introduced the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]], to help assign realistic wind speeds to tornado damage. The scientists specifically designed the scale so that a tornado assessed on the Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita scale would receive the same ranking. The EF-scale is more specific in detailing the degrees of damage on different types of structures for a given wind speed. While the F-scale goes from F0 to F12 in theory, the EF-scale is capped at EF5, which is defined as "winds ≥{{convert|200|mph|abbr=on}}".&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado| title = The Online Tornado FAQ| accessdate = 2006-09-08| last = Edwards| first = Roger|authorlink= Roger Edwards (meteorologist)| date = 2006-04-04| publisher = [[Storm Prediction Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the Enhanced Fujita scale went into effect on February 2, 2007 for tornado damage assessments and the Fujita scale is no longer used.

The first observation which confirmed that F5 winds could occur happened on April 26, 1991. A [[1991 Red Rock tornado|tornado near Red Rock, Oklahoma]] was monitored by scientists using a portable Doppler radar, an experimental radar device that measures wind speed. Near the tornado's peak intensity, they recorded a wind speed of {{convert|115|-|120|m/s|mph+km/h|abbr=on}}. Though the portable radar had uncertainty of ±{{convert|5|-|10|m/s|mph+km/h|abbr=on}}, this reading was probably within the F5 range, confirming that tornadoes were capable of violent winds found nowhere else on earth.

Eight years later, during the [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak]] of May 3, 1999, another scientific team was monitoring an exceptionally violent tornado (one which would eventually kill 36&amp;nbsp;people in the [[Oklahoma City metropolitan area]]). At about 7:00 pm, they recorded one measurement of {{convert|301|±|20|mph|km/h|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="fastest wind"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cswr.org/dow/DOW.htm| title = Doppler On Wheels| accessdate = 2006-12-29| author = [http://cswr.org/ Center for Severe Weather Research]| year = 2006| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070205124033/http://www.cswr.org/dow/dow.htm| archivedate = 2007-02-05| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} faster than the previous record. Though this reading is just short of the theoretical F6 rating, the measurement was taken more than {{convert|100|ft|m}} in the air, where winds are typically stronger than at the surface.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} In rating tornadoes, only surface wind speeds, or the wind speeds indicated by the damage resulting from the tornado, are taken into account. Also, in practice, the F6 rating is not used.

While scientists have long theorized that extremely low pressures might occur in the center of tornadoes, there were no measurements to confirm it.  A few home [[barometer]]s had survived close passes by tornadoes, recording values as low as {{convert|24|inHg|hPa|abbr=on}}, but these measurements were highly uncertain.&lt;ref name="Handy Weather Answer Book"&gt;Lyons, Walter A. &lt;u&gt;The Handy Weather Answer Book&lt;/u&gt;. Detroit: Visible Ink Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 24, 2003, a group of researchers successfully dropped devices called "turtles" into an F4 tornado near [[Manchester, South Dakota]], one of which measured a pressure drop of more than {{convert|100|hPa|inHg|abbr=on}} as the tornado passed directly overhead.&lt;ref name="tornado pressure"&gt;[http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0404/feature1/fulltext.html Chasing Tornadoes @ National Geographic Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; Still, tornadoes are widely varied, so meteorologists are still conducting research to determine if these values are typical or not.

== Typical intensity ==
In the United States, F0 and F1 (T0 through T3) tornadoes account for 80% of all tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strength&amp;mdash;violent tornadoes (stronger than F4, T8), account for less than 1% of all tornado reports.&lt;ref name="Basic Spotter Guide"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/brochures/basicspot.pdf| title = Basic Spotters' Field Guide| accessdate = 2006-11-01| author = Edwards, Moller, Purpura|authorlink= Roger Edwards (meteorologist)| year = 2005| format = PDF| publisher = [[US Department of Commerce]], [[National Weather Service]]|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, strong tornadoes account for an even smaller percentage of total tornadoes.  Violent tornadoes are extremely rare outside of the United States, Canada and Bangladesh.

F5 and EF5 tornadoes are rare, occurring on average once every few years. An F5 tornado was reported in [[2007 Elie, Manitoba tornado|Elie, Manitoba]] in Canada, on June 22, 2007. Before that, the last confirmed F5 was the [[1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado]], which killed 36 people on May 3, 1999.&lt;ref name="severe plot"&gt;Data from the [[Storm Prediction Center]] archives, which are accessible through [http://www.spc.noaa.gov/software/svrplot2/ SvrPlot], free software created and maintained by [[John Hart (meteorologist)|John Hart]], lead forecaster for the SPC.&lt;/ref&gt; Nine EF5 tornadoes have occurred in the United States, in [[Greensburg, Kansas]] on May 4, 2007; [[Parkersburg, Iowa]] on May 25, 2008; [[Smithville, Mississippi]], [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], [[Hackleburg, Alabama]] and [[Rainsville, Alabama]] (four separate tornadoes) on April 27, 2011; [[Joplin, Missouri]] on May 22, 2011 and [[El Reno, Oklahoma]] on May 24, 2011. On May 20, 2013 a confirmed  EF5 tornado again struck Moore, Oklahoma.

A typical tornado has winds of {{convert|110|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} or less, is approximately {{convert|250|ft|m}} across, and travels a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) or so before dissipating.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} However, tornadic behavior is extremely variable; these figures represent only statistical probability.

Two tornadoes that look almost exactly the same can produce drastically different effects. Also, two tornadoes which look very different can produce similar damage.  This is due to the fact that tornadoes form by several different mechanisms, and also that they follow a [[#Life cycle|life cycle]] which causes the same tornado to change in appearance over time. People in the path of a tornado should never attempt to determine its strength as it approaches. Between 1950 and 2014 in the United States, 222&amp;nbsp;people have been killed by EF1 tornadoes, and 21 have been killed by EF0 tornadoes.&lt;ref name=Tornadohistoryproject&gt;{{cite web|title=Search Tornadoes|url=http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/|website=Tornadohistoryproject.com|publisher=Tornadohistoryproject.com|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPC past tornadoes"&gt;"[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/historical.html Climatological or Past Storm Information and Archived Data]."  ''[http://www.spc.noaa.gov Storm Prediction Center]''.  2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weak tornadoes===
The vast majority of tornadoes are designated EF1 or EF0, also known as "weak" tornadoes. However, weak is a relative term for tornadoes, as even these can cause significant damage. F0 and F1 tornadoes are typically short-lived&amp;mdash;since 1980 almost 75% of tornadoes rated weak stayed on the ground for {{convert|1|mi|km}} or less.&lt;ref name="severe plot"/&gt; However, in this time, they can cause both damage and fatalities.

EF0 (T0-T1) damage is characterized by superficial damage to structures and vegetation. Well-built structures are typically unscathed, sometimes sustaining broken windows, with minor damage to roofs and [[chimney]]s. Billboards and large signs can be knocked down. Trees may have large branches broken off, and can be uprooted if they have shallow roots. Any tornado that is confirmed but causes no damage (i.e. remains in open fields) is always rated EF0 as well.

EF1 (T2-T3) damage has caused significantly more fatalities than that caused by EF0 tornadoes. At this level, damage to mobile homes and other temporary structures becomes significant, and cars and other vehicles can be pushed off the road or flipped. Permanent structures can suffer major damage to their roofs.

|E/F0 damage: The only significant damage to structures in this picture was caused by falling tree branches. Even though well-built structures are typically unscathed by E/F0 tornadoes, falling trees and tree branches can injure and kill people, even inside a sturdy structure. Between 35% to 40% of all annual tornadoes in the U.S. are E/F0 tornadoes.
|File:F1 tornado damage example.jpg
|E/F1 damage: Cause major damage to [[mobile home]]s and automobiles, and can cause minor structural damage to well-constructed homes. This unanchored [[Light-frame construction|wood-frame home]] sustained major roof damage, and was pushed from its foundation while remaining intact. Around 35% of all annual tornadoes in the U.S. are E/F1 tornadoes.
}}

===Significant tornadoes===
EF2 (T4-T5) tornadoes are the lower end of "significant", and yet are stronger than most [[tropical cyclone]]s (though tropical cyclones affect a much larger area and their winds take place for a much longer duration). Well-built structures can suffer serious damage, including roof loss, and collapse of some exterior walls may occur at poorly built structures. Mobile homes, however, are totally destroyed. Vehicles can be lifted off the ground, and lighter objects can become small [[Projectile|missile]]s, causing damage outside of the tornado's main path. Wooded areas will have a large percentage of their trees snapped or uprooted.

EF3 (T6-T7) damage is a serious risk to life and limb and the point at which a tornado statistically becomes significantly more destructive and deadly. Few parts of affected buildings are left standing; well-built structures lose all outer and some inner walls. Unanchored homes are swept away, and homes with poor anchoring may collapse entirely. Small vehicles and similarly sized objects are lifted off the ground and tossed as projectiles. Wooded areas will suffer almost total loss of vegetation, and some tree debarking may occur. Statistically speaking, EF3 is the maximum level that allows for reasonably effective residential sheltering in place in a first floor interior room closest to the center of the house (the most widespread tornado sheltering procedure in America for those with no basement or underground storm shelter).

{{Gallery
|title=Significant tornadoes
|width=160 | height=170
|align=center
|File:F2 tornado damage example.jpg
|E/F2 damage: At this intensity, tornadoes have a more significant impact on well-built structures, removing the roofs, and collapsing some exterior walls of poorly built structures. E/F2 tornadoes are capable of completely destroying mobile homes, and generating large amounts of flying debris. This frail wood-frame home sustained major structural damage, and it was moved slightly off its [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]], with its roof completely gone. Between 15% to 19% of all annual tornadoes in the U.S. are E/F2 tornadoes.
|File:F3 tornado damage example.jpg
|E/F3 damage: Here, the roof and all but some inner walls of this brick home have been demolished.  While taking shelter in a [[basement]], [[Basement|cellar]], or inner room improves your odds of surviving a tornado drastically, occasionally even this is not enough. E/F3 and stronger tornadoes only account for about 6% of all annual tornadoes in the United States, and yet since 1980 they have accounted for more than 75% of tornado-related deaths.

===Violent tornadoes===
While isolated examples exist of people surviving E/F5 impacts in their homes—one survivor of the [[1997 Central Texas tornado outbreak|Jarrell F5]] sheltered in a bathtub and was miraculously blown to safety as her house disintegrated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.usatoday.com/weather/wtxtrcvr.htm| title = Twister's wounds run deep| accessdate = 2006-11-01| last = Wolf| first = Richard| date = 1997-11-28|work = [[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;—surviving an E/F5 impact outside of a robust and properly constructed underground [[storm shelter]] is statistically unlikely.

EF4 (T8-T9) damage typically results in a total loss of the affected structure. Well-built homes are reduced to a short pile of medium-sized debris on the foundation. Homes with poor or no anchoring will be swept completely away. Large, heavy vehicles, including [[airplane]]s, trains, and large trucks, can be pushed over, flipped repeatedly or picked up and thrown. Large, healthy trees are entirely debarked and snapped off close to the ground or uprooted altogether and turned into flying projectiles. Passenger cars and similarly sized objects can be picked up and flung for considerable distances. EF4 damage can be expected to level even the most robustly built homes, making the common practice of sheltering in an interior room on the ground floor of a residence insufficient to ensure survival. A [[storm shelter]], reinforced basement or other subterranean shelter is considered necessary to provide any reasonable expectation of safety against EF4 damage.

EF5 (T10-T11) damage represents the upper limit of tornado power, and destruction is almost always total. An EF5 tornado pulls well-built, well-anchored homes off their foundations and into the air before obliterating them, flinging the wreckage for miles and sweeping the foundation clean. Large, steel reinforced structures such as schools are completely leveled. Tornadoes of this intensity tend to shred and scour low-lying grass and vegetation from the ground. Very little recognizable structural debris is generated by EF5 damage, with most materials reduced to a coarse mix of small, granular particles and dispersed evenly across the tornado's damage path. Large, multi-ton steel frame vehicles and farm equipment are often mangled beyond recognition and deposited miles away or reduced entirely to unrecognizable component parts. The official description of this damage highlights the extreme nature of the destruction, noting that "incredible phenomena will occur"; historically, this has included such awesome displays of power as [[1970 Lubbock tornado|twisting skyscrapers]], [[May 2007 tornado outbreak#The Greensburg tornado family|leveling entire communities]], and [[1985 United States–Canada tornado outbreak|stripping asphalt from roadbeds]]. Despite their relative rarity, the damage caused by EF5 tornadoes represents a disproportionately extreme hazard to life and limb&amp;mdash; since 1950 in the United States, only 58 tornadoes (0.1% of all reports) have been designated F5 or EF5, and yet these have been responsible for more than 1300 deaths and 14,000 injuries (21.5% and 13.6%, respectively).&lt;ref name="severe plot"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.norman.noaa.gov/nsww/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/LaDue_NSWW2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Above-ground structures are almost completely vulnerable to E/F4 tornadoes, which level well-built structures, toss heavy vehicles through the air, and uproot trees, turning them into flying missiles.

Beginning in the early 1960s, demand for high-temperature materials by the nascent aerospace industry prompted the Air Force Materials Laboratory to begin funding the development of a new class of materials that could withstand the environment of proposed [[Hypersonic Technology Vehicle|hypersonic vehicles]] such as Dyna-soar and the Space Shuttle at Manlabs Incorporated. Through a systematic investigation of the [[refractory]] properties of binary ceramics, they discovered that the early transition metal borides, carbides, and nitrides had surprisingly high [[thermal conductivity]], resistance to [[oxidation]], and reasonable [[mechanical strength]] when small [[grain size]]s were used. Of these, [[Zirconium diboride|ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Hafnium diboride|HfB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in [[composite material|composites]] containing approximately 20% volume [[SiC]] were found to be the best performing.&lt;ref name="Reference11"&gt;{{cite book |title = Handbook of Ceramic Composites|publisher = [[Springer Publishing|Springer]]| year = 2004|pages = 198 | editor = Bansal, Narottam P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UHTC research was largely abandoned after the pioneering mid-century Manlabs work due to the completion of the [[Space Shuttle]] missions and the elimination of the [[Air force]] spaceplane development. Three decades later, however, research interest was rekindled by a string of 1990s era [[NASA]] programs aimed at developing a fully reusable [[Hypersonic Technology Vehicle|hypersonic spaceplane]] such as the National Aerospace Plane, Venturestar/X-33, Boeing X-37, and the Air Force's Blackstar program.&lt;ref name="Reference30"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Overview of United States space propulsion technology and associated space transportation systems|journal = [[Journal of Propulsion and Power]]| year = 2006|volume =22 |pages = 1310 | author = Sackheim, Robert L. |doi=10.2514/1.23257}}&lt;/ref&gt; New research in UHTCs was led by [[NASA Ames Research Center|NASA Ames]], with research at the center continuing to the present through funding from the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program. UHTCs also saw expanded use in varied environments, from nuclear engineering to aluminum production.

In order to test real world performance of UHTC materials in reentry environments, NASA Ames conducted two flight experiments in 1997 and 2000. The slender Hypersonic Aero-thermodynamic Research Probes (SHARP B1 and B2) briefly exposed the UHTC materials to actual reentry environments by mounting them on modified nuclear ordnance Mk12A reentry vehicles and launching them on Minuteman III ICBMs. Sharp B-1 had a HfB2/SiC nosecone with a tip radius of 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm which experienced temperatures well above 2815&amp;nbsp;°C during reentry, ablating away at an airspeed of 6.9&amp;nbsp;km/s as predicted; however, it was not recovered and its axially-symmetric cone shape did not provide [[flexural strength]] data needed to evaluate the performance of UHTCs in linear leading edges.&lt;ref name="Reference13"&gt;{{cite conference |title = Recent Developments in Ultra High Temperature Ceramics at NASA Ames|conference = 16th AIAA/DLR/DGLR International Space Planes and Hypersonic Systems and Technologies Conference| year = 2009|author1=S.

Stackpole }}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve the characterization of UHTC mechanical strength and better study their performance, SHARP-B2, was recovered and included four retractable, sharp wedge-like protrusions called "strakes" which each contained three different UHTC compositions which were extended into the reentry flow at different altitudes.

The SHARP-B2 test that followed permitted recovery of four segmented strakes which had three sections, each consisting of a different HfB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Composite material|composite]] as shown in Figure 1.&lt;ref name="Reference20" /&gt; The vehicle was successfully recovered, despite the fact that it impacted the sea at three times the predicted velocity. The four rear strake segments (HfB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) fractured between 14 and 19 seconds into reentry, two mid segments (ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/SiC) fractured, and no fore strake segments (ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/SiC/C) failed.&lt;ref name="Reference20" /&gt; The actual heat flux was 60% less than expected, actual temperatures were much lower than expected, and [[heat flux]] on the rear strakes was much higher than expected. The material failures were found to result from very large grain sizes in the composites and pure ceramics, with cracks following macroscopic crystal [[Grain boundary|grain boundaries]]. Since this test, NASA Ames has continued refining production techniques for UHTC synthesis and performing basic research on UHTCs.&lt;ref name="Reference14"&gt;{{cite conference |title = SHARP-B 2: Flight Test Objectives, Project Implementation and Initial Results|conference = 2nd Annual Conference on Composites, Materials and Structures, Cocoa Beach, FL, United States| year = 2001|volume =22 | author = Salute, Joan|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structure ===

UHTCs all exhibit strong [[covalent bond]]ing which gives them [[structural stability]] at high temperatures. Metal [[carbide]]s are brittle due to the strong bonds that exist between carbon atoms. The largest class of carbides, including [[Hafnium|Hf]], [[Zirconium|Zr]], [[Titanium|Ti]] and [[Tantalum|Ta]] carbides have high melting points due to covalent carbon networks although carbon vacancies often exist in these materials;&lt;ref name="Reference21"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Mechanically activated solid-state synthesis of hafnium carbide and hafnium nitride nanoparticles|journal = [[Journal of Alloys and Compounds]]| year = 2008|volume =456 |pages = 224–233 | author = Barraud, Elodie|doi=10.1016/j.jallcom.2007.02.017|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, [[Hafnium carbide|HfC]] has one of the highest melting points of any material. Nitrides such as [[Zirconium nitride|ZrN]] and HfN have similarly strong covalent bonds but their refractory nature makes them especially difficult to synthesize and process. The stoichiometric nitrogen content can be varied in these complexes based on the synthetic technique utilized; different nitrogen content will give different properties to the material, such as how if x exceeds 1.2 in ZrNx, a new optically transparent and electrically insulating phase appears to form. Ceramic borides such as HfB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; benefit from very strong bonding between boron atoms as well as strong metal to boron bonds; the [[hexagonal close-packed]] structure with alternating two-dimensional boron and metal sheets give these materials high but [[anisotropic]] strength as [[single crystals]]. Borides exhibit high thermal conductivity (on the order of 75 – 105 W/mK) and low coefficients of [[thermal expansion]] (5 – 7.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; K-1) and improved oxidation resistance in comparison to other classes of UHTCs. Thermal expansion, thermal conductivity and other data are shown in Table 2. The crystal structures, [[lattice parameter]]s, densities, and melting points of different UHTCs are shown in Table 1.&lt;ref name="Reference20" /&gt;

=== Thermodynamic properties ===

In comparison with carbide and nitride-based ceramics, diboride-based UHTCs exhibit higher thermal conductivity (refer to Table 2, where we can see that hafnium diboride has thermal conductivity of 105, 75, 70&amp;nbsp;W/m*K at different temperature while [[hafnium carbide]] and nitride have values only around 20W/m*K).&lt;ref name="Reference25"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Processing and characterization of ZrB 2-based ultra-high temperature monolithic and fibrous monolithic ceramics|journal = [[Journal of Materials Science]]| year = 2004|volume =39 |pages = 5951–5957 | author = Fahrenholtz, W. G.|doi=10.1023/b:jmsc.0000041691.41116.bf|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2004JMatS..39.5951F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal shock resistance of HfB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was investigated by ManLabs and it was found that these materials did not fail at [[thermal gradient]]s sufficient for the failure of SiC; indeed, it was found that hollow cylinders could not be cracked by an applied radial thermal gradient without first being notched on the inner surface. UHTCs generally exhibit [[thermal expansion coefficient]]s in the range of 5.9–8.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.The structural and thermal stability of ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HfB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; UHTCs results from the occupancy of bonding and antibonding levels in hexagonal MB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structures with alternating hexagonal sheets of metal and boride atoms. In such structures, the principal frontier electronic states are bonding and [[antibonding orbitals]] resulting from bonding between boron 2p orbitals and metal d orbitals; before group (IV), the number of available electrons in a unit cell is insufficient to fill all bonding orbitals, and beyond it they begin to fill the antibonding orbitals. Both effects reduce the overall [[bonding strength]] in the [[unit cell]] and therefore the enthalpy of formation and melting point. Experimental evidence shows that as one moves across the transition metal series in a given period, the enthalpy of formation of MB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ceramics increases and peaks at Ti, Zr, and Hf before decaying as the metal gets heavier. As a result, the enthalpies of formation of several important UHTCs are as follows: [[Hafnium diboride|HfB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] &gt; [[TiB2|TiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] &gt; [[Zirconium diboride|ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] &gt; [[TaB2|TaB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] &gt; [[Niobium diboride|NbB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] &gt; VB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Reference30" /&gt;

=== Mechanical properties ===

Table 3 lists UHTC carbides and borides mechanical properties.&lt;ref name="Reference31"&gt;{{cite book |title = Handbook of Ceramic Composites|publisher = Springer| year = 2004|pages = 211 | editor =  Bansal, Narottam P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is extremely important that UHTCs are able to retain high bending strength and hardness at high temperatures (above 2000&amp;nbsp;°C). UHTCs generally exhibit hardness above 20 GPa&lt;ref name="Reference32"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Research and Development of Refractory Oxidation Resistant Diborides|journal = Part II, AFML-TR-68-190, ManLabs Inc., Cambridge, MA| year = 1968|volume =IV: Mechanical Properties | author = Rhodes, W. H., Clougherty, E. V. and Kalish, D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the strong covalent bonds present in these materials. However, the different methods of processing UHTCs can lead to great variation in hardness values. UHTCs exhibit high flexural strengths of &gt;&amp;nbsp;200 MPa at 1800&amp;nbsp;°C, and UHTCs with fine-grained particles exhibit higher flexural strengths than UHTCs with coarse grains. It has been shown that diboride ceramics synthesized as a composite with silicon carbide (SiC) exhibit increased fracture toughness (increase of 20% to 4.33 MPam&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;) relative to the pure diborides. This is due to material [[densification]]&lt;ref name="Reference39"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Ultrahigh temperature ceramics (UHTCs) based on ZrB2 and HfB2 systems: Powder synthesis, densification and mechanical properties|journal = [[Journal of Physics: Conference Series]]| year = 2009|volume =176 | author = Zhang, Guo-Jun|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a reduction in grain size upon processing.

=== Chemical properties ===

While UHTCs have desirable thermal and mechanical properties, they are susceptible to oxidation at their elevated [[operating temperature]]s. The metal component oxidizes to a gas such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is rapidly lost at the elevated temperatures UHTCs are most useful at; boron, for example, readily oxidizes to [[Boron trioxide|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] which becomes a liquid at 490&amp;nbsp;°C and vaporizes very rapidly above 1100&amp;nbsp;°C; in addition, their [[brittleness]] makes them poor engineering materials. Current research targets increasing their [[toughness]] and oxidation resistance by exploring composites with [[silicon carbide]], the incorporation of fibers, and the addition of rare-earth hexaborides such as [[lanthanum hexaboride]] (LaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). It has been found that the oxidative resistance of HfB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are greatly enhanced through the inclusion of 30% weight silicon carbide due to the formation of a protective glassy surface layer upon the application of temperatures in excess of 1000&amp;nbsp;°C composed of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Reference34"&gt;{{cite journal |title = UHTC composites for hypersonic applications|journal = [[The American Ceramic Society Bulletin]]| year = 2012|volume =91 |pages = 22–28 | author = Paul, A.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; To determine the effect of SiC content on diboride oxidation, ManLabs conducted a series of furnace oxidation experiments, in which the oxidation scale thickness as a function of temperature for pure HfB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SiC and HfB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 20v% SiC were compared. At temperatures greater than 2100 K the oxide scale thickness on pure HfB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is thinner than that on pure SiC, and HfB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/20% SiC has the best oxidation resistance. Extreme heat treatment leads to greater oxidation resistance as well as improved mechanical properties such as fracture resistance.&lt;ref name="Reference35"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Effects of heat treatments on oxidation resistance and mechanical properties of ultra high temperature ceramic coatings|journal = [[Surface and Coatings Technology]]| year = 2008|volume =202 |pages = 4394–4398 | author = Tului, Mario|doi=10.1016/j.surfcoat.2008.04.015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synthesis of diboride (Zr, Hf, Ti) UHTCs ==

UHTCs possess simple [[empirical formula]]s and thus can be prepared by a wide variety of synthetic methods. UHTCs such as ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be synthesized by stoichiometric reaction between constituent elements, in this case [[Zirconium|Zr]] and [[Boron|B]]. This reaction provides for precise stoichiometric control of the materials.&lt;ref name="Reference36"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Preparation of nano-size ZrB&lt;sub&gt; 2&lt;/sub&gt; powder by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis|journal = [[Journal of the European Ceramic Society]]| year = 2009|volume =29 |pages = 1501–1506 |author1=Çamurlu, H. Erdem |author2=Filippo Maglia.  |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2008.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 2000 K, the formation of ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via stoichiometric reaction is thermodynamically favorable (ΔG=−279.6 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and therefore, this route can be used to produce ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS). This technique takes advantage of the high exothermic energy of the reaction to cause high temperature, fast combustion reactions. Advantages of SHS include higher purity of ceramic products, increased sinterability, and shorter processing times. However, the extremely rapid heating rates can result in incomplete reactions between Zr and B, the formation of stable oxides of Zr, and the retention of [[porosity]]. Stoichiometric reactions have also been carried out by reaction of attrition milled (wearing materials by grinding) Zr and B powder (and then hot pressing at 600&amp;nbsp;°C for 6 h), and nanoscale particles have been obtained by reacting attrition milled Zr and B [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] [[crystallite]]s (10&amp;nbsp;nm in size).&lt;ref name="Reference37"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Reactive hot pressing of zirconium diboride|journal = [[Journal of the European Ceramic Society]]| year = 2009|volume =29 |pages = 3401–3408 | author = Chamberlain, Adam L., William G. Fahrenholtz, and Gregory E. Hilmas. |doi=10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2009.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, all of the stoichiometric reaction methods for synthesizing UHTCs employ expensive charge materials, and therefore these methods are not useful for large-scale or industrial applications.

Reduction of ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to their respective diborides can also be achieved via metallothermic reduction. Inexpensive precursor materials are used and reacted according to the reaction below:

ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5Mg → ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 5MgO

Mg is used as a reactant in order to allow for acid leaching of unwanted oxide products. Stoichiometric excesses of Mg and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are often required during metallothermic reductions in order to consume all available ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These reactions are [[exothermic]] and can be used to produce the diborides by SHS. Production of ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from [[Zirconium dioxide|ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] via SHS often leads to incomplete conversion of reactants, and therefore double SHS (DSHS) has been employed by some researchers.&lt;ref name="Reference38"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Preparation of ultrafine boride powders by metallothermic reduction method|journal = [[Journal of Physics: Conference Series]]| year = 2009|volume =176 | author = Nishiyama, Katsuhiro|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second SHS reaction with Mg and [[Boric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] as reactants along with the ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixture yields increased conversion to the diboride, and particle sizes of 25–40&amp;nbsp;nm at 800&amp;nbsp;°C. After metallothermic reduction and DSHS reactions, MgO can be separated from ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by mild [[leaching (metallurgy)|acid leaching]].

Synthesis of UHTCs by [[boron carbide]] reduction is one of the most popular methods for UHTC synthesis. The precursor materials for this reaction (ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[Boron carbide|B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C)]] are less expensive than those required by the [[stoichiometric]] and borothermic reactions. ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is prepared at greater than 1600&amp;nbsp;°C for at least 1 hour by the following reaction:

2ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C + 3C → 2ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4CO

This method requires a slight excess of boron, as some boron is oxidized during boron carbide reduction. [[Zirconium carbide|ZrC]] has also been observed as a product from the reaction, but if the reaction is carried out with 20–25% excess B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C, the ZrC phase disappears, and only ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; remains.&lt;ref name="Reference39" /&gt; Lower synthesis temperatures (~1600&amp;nbsp;°C) produce UHTCs that exhibit finer [[grain size]]s and better sinterability. Boron carbide must be subjected to grinding prior to the boron carbide reduction in order to promote oxide reduction and diffusion processes.

Boron carbide reductions can also be carried out via reactive [[plasma spraying]] if a UHTC coating is desired. Precursor or powder particles react with plasma at high temperatures (6000–15000&amp;nbsp;°C) which greatly reduces the reaction time.&lt;ref name="Reference40"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Microstructure and Phase Composition of Composite Coatings Formed by Plasma Spraying of ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C Powders|journal = [[Journal of Thermal Spray Technology]]| year = 2010|volume =19 |pages = 816–823 | author = Karuna Purnapu Rupa, P.|doi=10.1007/s11666-010-9479-y|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2010JTST...19..816K }}&lt;/ref&gt; ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phases have been formed using a plasma voltage and current of 50 V and 500 A, respectively. These coating materials exhibit uniform distribution of fine particles and porous microstructures, which increased hydrogen [[Flow measurement|flow rate]]s.

Another method for the synthesis of UHTCs is the borothermic reduction of ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with B.&lt;ref name="Reference41"&gt;{{cite journal |title = On the borothermic preparation of titanium, zirconium and hafnium diborides|journal = [[Journal of the Less Common Metals]]| year = 1968|volume =14 |pages = 23–32 |author1=Peshev, P. |author2=G. Bliznakov.  |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1016/0022-5088(68)90199-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At temperatures higher than 1600&amp;nbsp;°C, pure diborides can be obtained from this method. Due to the loss of some boron as boron oxide, excess boron is needed during borothermic reduction. Mechanical milling can lower the reaction temperature required during borothermic reduction. This is due to the increased particle mixing and [[lattice defect]]s that result from decreased [[particle size]]s of ZnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and B after milling. This method is also not very useful for industrial applications due to the loss of expensive boron as [[boron oxide]] during the reaction.

Nanocrystals of group IV and V metal diborides such as TiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HfB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NbB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, TaB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were successfully synthesized by Zoli's Reaction, reduction of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; using a molar ratio M:B of 1:4 at 700&amp;nbsp;°C for 30 min under argon flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zoli|first1=Luca|last2=Costa|first2=Anna Luisa|last3=Sciti|first3=Diletta|title=Synthesis of nanosized zirconium diboride powder via oxide-borohydride solid-state reaction|journal=Scripta Materialia|date=December 2015|volume=109|pages=100–103|doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2015.07.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zoli|first1=Luca|last2=Galizia|first2=Pietro|last3=Silvestroni|first3=Laura|last4=Sciti|first4=Diletta|title=Synthesis of group IV and V metal diboride nanocrystals via borothermal reduction with sodium borohydride|journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society|date=23 January 2018|doi=10.1111/jace.15401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UHTCs can be prepared from solution-based synthesis methods as well, although few substantial studies have been conducted. Solution-based methods allow for low temperature synthesis of ultrafine UHTC powders. Yan et al. have synthesized ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; powders using the inorganic-organic precursors ZrOC&lt;sub&gt;l2&lt;/sub&gt;•8H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, [[boric acid]] and [[phenolic resin]] at 1500&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Reference42"&gt;{{cite journal |title = New Route to Synthesize Ultra‐Fine Zirconium Diboride Powders Using Inorganic–Organic Hybrid Precursors|journal = [[Journal of the American Ceramic Society]]| year = 2006|volume =89 |pages = 3585–3588 | author = Yan, Yongjie|doi=10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01269.x|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The synthesized powders exhibit 200&amp;nbsp;nm crystallite size and low oxygen content (~ 1.0 wt%). UHTC preparation from polymeric precursors has also been recently investigated. ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be dispersed in boron carbide polymeric precursors prior to reaction. Heating the reaction mixture to 1500&amp;nbsp;°C results in the in situ generation of boron carbide and carbon, and the reduction of ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; soon follows.&lt;ref name="reference43"&gt;{{cite journal|title = A polymer precursor route to metal borides|journal =[[Chemistry of Materials]]|year = 1993|volume = 5|pages = 1659–1668|author1=Su, Kai |author2=Larry G. Sneddon. |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1021/cm00035a013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polymer must be stable, processable, and contain boron and carbon in order to be useful for the reaction. Dinitrile polymers formed from the condensation of dinitrile with decaborane satisfy these criteria.

[[Chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) of titanium and zirconium diborides is another method for preparing coatings of UHTCs. These techniques rely on [[metal halide]] and boron halide precursors (such as [[Titanium tetrachloride|TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Boron trichloride|BCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]) in the gaseous phase and use H2 as a [[reducing agent]]. This synthesis route can be employed at low temperatures and produces [[thin films]] for coating on metal (and other material) surfaces. Mojima et al. have used CVD to prepare coatings of ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on Cu at 700–900&amp;nbsp;°C (Figure 2).&lt;ref name="reference44"&gt;{{cite journal|title = ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coated on copper plate by chemical vapour deposition, and its corrosion and oxidation stabilities|journal =[[Thin Solid Films]]|year = 1990|volume = 189|pages = 73–79|author = Motojima, Seiji, Kimie Funahashi, and Kazuyuki Kurosawa.|doi=10.1016/0040-6090(90)90028-c|bibcode = 1990TSF...189...73M }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition|Plasma enhanced CVD]] (PECVD) has also been used to prepare UHTC diborides. After plasma of the reacting gases is created (by radio frequency or direct current discharge between two electrodes) the reaction takes place, followed by [[deposition (chemistry)|deposition]]. The deposition takes place at lower temperatures compared to traditional CVD because only the plasma needs to be heated to provide sufficient energy for the reaction.

== Processing of UHTCs and the addition of SiC ==

Diboride-based UHTCs often require high-temperature and -pressure processing to produce dense, durable materials. The high melting points and strong covalent interactions present in UHTCs make it difficult to achieve uniform densification in these materials. [[Densification]] is only achieved at temperatures above 1800&amp;nbsp;°C once grain boundary diffusion mechanisms become active.&lt;ref name="reference47"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Synthesis and consolidation of zirconium diboride: review|journal =[[Advances in Applied Ceramics]]|year = 2011|volume = 110|pages = 321–334|author1=Sonber, J. K. |author2=A. K. Suri. |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1179/1743676111y.0000000008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, processing of UHTCs at these temperatures results in materials with larger grain sizes and poor mechanical properties including reduced toughness and [[hardness]]. To achieve densification at lower temperatures, several techniques can be employed: additives such as SiC can be used in order to form a liquid phase at the sintering temperature, the surface oxide layer can be removed, or the defect concentration can be increased. SiC can react with the surface oxide layer in order to provide diboride surfaces with higher energy: adding 5–30 vol% SiC has demonstrated improved densification and oxidation resistance of UHTCs.&lt;ref name="reference48"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Investigation of Boride Compounds for Very High-Temperature Applications|journal =ManLabs. Inc., Cambridge, Mass|year = 1963|author1=Kaufman, Larry |author2=Edward V. Clougherty.  |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; SiC can be added as a powder or a polymer to diboride UHTCs. The addition of SiC as a polymer has several advantages over the more traditional addition of SiC as a powder because SiC forms along the grain boundaries when added as a polymer, which increases measures of fracture toughness (by ~24%).&lt;ref name="reference49"&gt;{{cite journal|title = A Simple Polymeric Precursor Strategy for the Syntheses of Complex Zirconium and Hafnium‐Based Ultra High‐Temperature Silicon‐Carbide Composite Ceramics|journal =[[Journal of the American Ceramic Society]]|year = 2008|volume = 91|pages = 1412–1415|author = Guron, Marta M., Myung Jong Kim, and Larry G. Sneddon.|doi=10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.02217.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to improved mechanical properties, less SiC needs to be added when using this method, which limits the pathways for oxygen to diffuse into the material and react. Although addition of additives such as SiC can improve densification of UHTC materials, it should be noted that these additives lower the maximum temperature at which UHTCs can operate due to the formation of [[eutectic]] liquids. The addition of SiC to ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lowers the operating temperature of ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from 3245&amp;nbsp;°C to 2270&amp;nbsp;°C.

Hot pressing is a popular method for obtaining densified UHTC materials that relies upon both high temperatures and pressures to produce densified materials. Powder compacts are heated externally and pressure is applied hydraulitically. In order to improve densification during hot pressing, diboride powders can undergo milling by attrition to obtain powders of &lt;2μm. Milling also allows for more uniform dispersion of the additive SiC. Hot pressing temperature, pressure, heating rate, reaction atmosphere, and holding times are all factors that affect the density and [[microstructure]] of UHTC pellets obtained from this method. In order to achieve &gt;99% densification from hot pressing, temperatures of 1800–2000&amp;nbsp;°C and pressures of 30 MPa or greater are required. UHTC materials with 20vol.% SiC and toughened with 5% carbon black as additives exhibit increased densification above 1500&amp;nbsp;°C, but these materials still require temperatures of 1900&amp;nbsp;°C and a pressure of 30 MPa in order to obtain near theoretical densities.&lt;ref name="reference50"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Microstructure, mechanical properties and thermal shock resistance of zirconium diboride containing silicon carbide ceramic toughened by carbon black|journal =[[Materials Chemistry and Physics]]|year = 2010|volume = 122|pages = 470–473|author = Zhou, Shanbao|doi=10.1016/j.matchemphys.2010.03.028|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other additives such as [[Aluminium oxide|Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Yttrium(III) oxide|Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] have also been used during the hot pressing of ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-SiC composites at 1800&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="reference51"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Densification, microstructure and mechanical properties of ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–SiCw ceramic composites|journal =[[Journal of the European Ceramic Society]]|year = 2009|volume = 29|pages = 2893–2901|author = Zhu, Tao|doi=10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2009.03.008|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These additives react with impurities to form a transient liquid phase and promote sintering of the diboride composites. The addition of rare earth oxides such as Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Yb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Lanthanum oxide|La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Neodymium(III) oxide|Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] can lower densification temperatures and can react with surface oxides to promote densification.&lt;ref name="reference52"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Effects of Y2O3 on microstructure and mechanical properties of ZrB2- SiC ceramics|journal =[[Journal of Alloys and Compounds]]|year = 2008|volume = 465|pages = 506–511|author = Zhang, Xinghong|doi=10.1016/j.jallcom.2007.10.137|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hot pressing may result in improved densities for UHTCs, but it is an expensive technique that relies on high temperatures and pressures to provide useful materials.

[[Pressureless sintering]] is another method for processing and densifying UHTCs. Pressureless sintering involves heating powdered materials in a mold in order to promote atomic diffusion and create a solid material. Compacts are prepared by uniaxial die [[Cold compaction|compaction]], and then the compacts are fired at chosen temperatures in a controlled atmosphere. [[Exaggerated grain growth]] that hinders densification occurs during sintering due to the low-intrinsic sinterability and the strong covalent bonds of Ti, Zr, and Hf diborides. Full densification of ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by pressureless sintering is very difficult to obtain; Chamberlain et al. have only been able to obtain ~98% densification by heating at 2150&amp;nbsp;°C for 9 h (Figure 3).&lt;ref name="reference53"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Pressureless sintering of zirconium diboride|journal =[[Journal of the American Ceramic Society]]|year = 2005|volume = 89|pages = 450–456|author = Chamberlain, Adam L., William G.

Spark plasma [[sintering]] is another method for the processing of UHTC materials. Spark plasma sintering often relies on slightly lower temperatures and significantly reduced processing times compared to hot pressing. During spark plasma sintering, a pulsed direct current passes through graphite punch rods and dies with uniaxial pressure exerted on the sample material. [[Grain growth]] is suppressed by rapid heating over the range 1500–1900&amp;nbsp;°C; this minimizes the time the material has to coarsen. Higher densities, cleaner grain boundaries, and elimination of surface impurities can all be achieved with spark plasma sintering. Spark plasma sintering also uses a pulsed current to generate an [[electrical discharge]] that cleans surface oxides off of the powder. This enhances grain boundary diffusion and migration as well as densification of the material. The UHTC composite ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/20vol%SiC can be prepared with 99% density at 2000&amp;nbsp;°C in 5 min via spark plasma sintering.&lt;ref name="reference56"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Densification and properties of transition metal borides-based cermets via spark plasma sintering|journal =[[Journal of the European Ceramic Society]]|year = 2006|volume = 26|pages = 2431–2440|author = Venkateswaran, T.|doi=10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2005.05.011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; ZrB2-SiC composites have also been prepared by spark plasma sintering at 1400&amp;nbsp;°C over a period of 9 min.&lt;ref name="reference57"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Effect of holding time and pressure on properties of ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-SiC composite fabricated by the spark plasma sintering reactive synthesis method|journal =[[International Journal of Refractory Metals and Hard Materials]]|year = 2009|volume = 27|pages = 177–180|author = Zhao, Yuan|doi=10.1016/j.ijrmhm.2008.02.003|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spark plasma sintering has proven to be a useful technique for the synthesis of UHTCs, especially for preparation of UHTCs with smaller grain sizes.

== Applications ==

UHTCs, specifically Hf and Zr based diboride, are being developed to handle the forces and temperatures experienced by leading vehicle edges in atmospheric reentry and sustained hypersonic flight. The surfaces of hypersonic vehicles experience extreme temperatures in excess of 2500&amp;nbsp;°C while also being exposed to high-temperature, high-flow-rate oxidizing plasma. The material design challenges associated with developing such surfaces have so far limited the design of orbital re-entry bodies and hypersonic air-breathing vehicles such as scramjets and DARPA's HTV because the bow shock in front of a blunt body protects the underlying surface from the full thermal force of the onrushing plasma with a thick layer of relatively dense and cool plasma.

Sharp edges dramatically reduce drag, but the current generation of thermal protection system materials are unable to withstand the considerably higher forces and temperatures experienced by sharp leading edges in reentry conditions. The relation between [[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]] and temperature in a leading edge is inversely proportional, e.g. as radius decreases temperature increases during [[hypersonic flight]]. Vehicles with "sharp" leading edges have significantly higher [[Lift-to-drag ratio|lift to drag ratios]], enhancing the fuel efficiency of sustained flight vehicles such as DARPA's HTV-3 and the landing cross-range and operational flexibility of reusable orbital spaceplane concepts being developed such as the Reaction Engines Skylon and Boeing X-33.&lt;ref name="reference58"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Ultra High Temperature Ceramics: Densification, Properties and Thermal Stability|journal =[[Journal AerospaceLab]]|year = 2011|volume = 3, AL03-08|author =J.F.

Zirconium diboride is used in many boiling water reactor fuel assemblies due to its refractory nature, [[corrosion resistance]], high-[[neutron absorption|neutron-absorption]] cross-section of 759 [[Barn (unit)|barns]], and stoichiometric boron content. Boron acts as a "burnable" neutron absorber because its two isotopes, 10B and 11B, both transmute into stable nuclear reaction products upon neutron absorption (4He + 7Li and 12C, respectively) and therefore act as sacrificial materials which protect other components which become more [[radioactive]] with exposure to [[thermal neutrons]]. However, the boron in ZrB2|ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must be enriched in 11B because the gaseous helium evolved by 10B strains the fuel [[Spheronisation|pellet]] of [[UO2|UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] creates a gap between coating and fuel, and increases the fuel's centerline temperature; such cladding materials&lt;ref name="reference59"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Study on in-situ synthesis of ZrB2 whiskers in ZrB2 ZrC matrix powder for ceramic cutting tools|journal =[[International Journal of Refractory Metals and Hard Materials]]|year = 2012|author = Xu, Liang|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been used on the [[uranium oxide]] fuel pellets in Westinghouse AP-1000 nuclear reactors.&lt;ref name="reference60"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Neutronic characteristics of using zirconium diboride and gadolinium in a Westinghouse 17x17 fuel assembly|journal =[[University of South California]], 1509920|year = 2012|author = Sironen, Charlton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high thermal neutron absorbance of boron also has the secondary effect of biasing the neutron spectrum to higher energies, so the fuel pellet retains more radioactive 239[[Plutonium-239|Pu]] at the end of a fuel cycle. In addition to this deleterious effect of integrating a neutron absorber on the surface of a fuel pellet, boron coatings have the effect of creating a power density bulge in the middle of a nuclear reactor fuel cycle through the superposition of 235[[Uranium-235|U]] depletion and faster burning of 11B. To help level out this bulge, ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/[[Gadolinium|Gd]] cermets are being studied which would extend fuel lifetime by superimposing three simultaneous degradation curves.

Due to the combination of refractory properties, high thermal conductivity, and the advantages of large stoichiometric boron content outlined in the above discussion of integral neutron absorbing fuel pellet cladding, refractory diborides have been used as control rod materials and have been studied for use in space nuclear power applications.&lt;ref name="reference61"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Compatibility of Refractory Materials for Nuclear Reactor Poison Control Systems|journal =NASA TM X-2963|year = 1974|author = Sinclair, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; While boron carbide is the most popular material for fast breeder reactors due to its lack of expense, extreme hardness comparable to diamond, and high cross-section, it completely disintegrates after a 5% burnup&lt;ref name="reference62"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Investigations on synthesis of HfB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and development of a new composite with TiSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|journal =[[International Journal of Refractory Metals and Hard Materials]]|year = 2010|volume = 28|pages = 201–210|author = Sonber, J. K.|doi=10.1016/j.ijrmhm.2009.09.005|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is reactive when in contact with refractory metals. Hafnium diboride also suffers from high susceptibility to material degradation with boron transmutation,&lt;ref name="reference63"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Effects of Radiation Upon Hafnium Diboride|year = 1961|author1=Ewing, Robert A. |author2=Duane Neuman Sunderman.  |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but its high melting point of 3380&amp;nbsp;°C and the large thermal neutron capture cross section of hafnium of 113 [[barn unit|barns]] and low reactivity with refractory metals such as [[tungsten]] makes it an attractive control rod material when clad with a refractory metal.&lt;ref name="reference64"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Microstructure and nanohardness of hafnium diboride after ion irradiations|journal =[[Journal of Nuclear Materials]]|year = 1998|volume = 256|pages = 180–188|author = Cheminant-Coatanlem, P.|doi=10.1016/s0022-3115(98)00059-2|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 1998JNuM..256..180C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Titanium diboride is a popular material for handling molten aluminum due to its electrical conductivity, refractory properties, and its ability to wet with molten aluminum providing a superior electrical interface while not contaminating the aluminum with boron or titanium. TiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been used as a drained cathode in the electroreduction of molten Al(III). In drained-cathode processes, aluminum can be produced with an electrode gap of only 0.25m with an accompanying reduction in required voltage. However, implementation of such technology still faces hurdles: with a reduction in voltage, there is a concomitant reduction in heat generation and better insulation at the top of the reactor is required. In addition to improved insulation, the technology requires better bonding methods between TiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the bulk graphite electrode substrate. Bonding tiles of TiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or applying composite coatings each present their own unique challenges, with the high cost and large TiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capital cost of the former and the design difficulty of the latter. Composite materials must have each component degrade at the same rate, or the [[wettability]] and thermal conductivity of the surface will be lost with active material still remaining deeper within the electrode plate.&lt;ref name="reference65"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Aluminum production paths in the new millennium|journal =[[JOM (journal)|Journal of the Minerals, Metals and Materials Society]]|year = 1999|volume = 51|pages = 24–28|author = Welch, Barry J|doi=10.1007/s11837-999-0036-4|bibcode = 1999JOM....51e..24W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/60%SiC composites have been used as novel conducting ceramic heaters which display high oxidation resistance and melting points, and do not display the [[negative temperature coefficient]] resistance property of pure silicon carbide. The metal-like conductance of ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allows for its conductivity to decrease with increasing temperature, preventing uncontrollable electrical discharge while maintaining high operational upper bounds for operation. It was also found that through incorporation of 40% ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flexural strength was reduced from 500 MPa and 359 MPa in SiC and ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals to 212.96 MPa, with flexural strength highly correlated to the size of grains in the annealed ceramic material. Conductivity at 500&amp;nbsp;°C was found to be 0.005 Ω cm for the 40% SiC composite, versus 0.16 Ω cm in pure SiC.&lt;ref name="reference66"&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Development of an Electroconductive SiC-ZrB Composite through Spark Plasma Sintering under Argon Atmosphere|journal =[[Journal of Electrical Engineering &amp; Technology]]|year = 2010|volume = 5|pages = 342–351|author = Shin, Yong-Deok|doi=10.5370/jeet.2010.5.2.342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2774">'''Vapour density''' is the [[density]] of a [[vapour]] in relation to that of [[hydrogen]]. It may be defined as mass of a certain volume of a substance divided by mass of same volume of hydrogen.

vapour density = mass of ''n'' molecules of gas / mass of ''n'' molecules of hydrogen.
 
Thus:

vapour density = molar mass of gas / molar mass of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

vapour density = molar mass of gas / 2.016

vapour density = ~½ &amp;times; molar mass

(and thus: molar mass = ~2 &amp;times; vapour density)
For example, vapour  density  of mixture of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is 38. 3.Vapour density is a unitless quantity.

==Alternative definition==

In many web sources, particularly in relation to safety considerations at commercial and industrial facilities in the U.S., vapour density is defined with respect to air, not hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msdsonline.com/CustomerSupport/GlossaryOfTerms/VaporDensity.aspx MSDS Glossary of Terms – Vapor Density]. Msdsonline.com. Retrieved on 2012-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Air is given a vapour density of one. For this use, air has a molecular weight of 28.97 atomic mass units, and all other gas and vapour molecular weights are divided by this number to derive their vapour density.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firenuggets.com/x_ARDSIllIIlllllIIIllIlIlIIIllllIllIl/peterson9.htm HazMat Math: Calculating Vapor Density] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711003737/http://www.firenuggets.com/x_ARDSIllIIlllllIIIllIlIlIIIllllIllIl/peterson9.htm |date=2011-07-11 }}. Firenuggets.com. Retrieved on 2012-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[acetone]] has a vapour density of 2&lt;ref&gt;[http://hazard.com/msds/mf/baker/baker/files/a0446.htm MSDS: Acetone]. Hazard.com (1998-04-21). Retrieved on 2012-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to air. That means acetone vapour is twice as heavy as air. This can be seen by dividing the molecular weight of Acetone, 58.1&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0004.html NIOSH Pocket Guide: Acetone]. Cdc.gov. Retrieved on 2012-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt; by that of air, 28.97, which equals 2.

With this definition, the vapour density would indicate whether a gas is denser (greater than one) or less dense (less than one) than air. The density has implications for container storage and personnel safety—if a container can release a dense gas, its vapour could sink and, if flammable, collect until it is at a concentration sufficient for ignition. Even if not flammable, it could collect in the lower floor or level of a confined space and displace air, possibly presenting an asphyxiation hazard to individuals entering the lower part of that space.

[[File:Vishap02.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A vishap]]
A '''''vishapakar''''' ({{lang-hy|Վիշապաքար}}) also known as '''vishap stones''', '''vishap stellas''', "serpent-stones", "dragon stones", or simply as '''vishaps''', are characteristic [[menhir]]s found in large quantities in the [[Armenian Highlands]], in natural and artificial ponds, and other sources of water. They are commonly carved from one piece of stone, into cigar-like shapes with fish heads or serpents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QS-vSjHObOYC&amp;pg=PA499&amp;dq=Vishapakar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V5E5Ua7WM8GyyAHGpoDQCg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Vishapakar&amp;f=false Historical Dictionary of Armenia]&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly they are images of [[vishap]]s, mystical creatures.

The words etymology is disputed, either meaning a poisonous water-living creature or a creature of prodigious size.&lt;ref&gt;James Russell, "Van and the Persistence of Memory", p47, in "Armenian Van/Vaspurakan", ed. Richard G. Hovannisian, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 150 vishaps in existence, of which 90 are found in Armenia.&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt;

== Mythology ==
[[File:Վիշապաքաղ.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Vahagn the Dragon Slayer]]
Certain studies believe [[Vishap]] is foremost worshipped as water, rain and a rich-giving soul, whose tail is capable of creating canals and paths when it hits the Earth. Vishap is also seen as an eerie monster who is a water source and guards treasure. Almost all the mythology explains divinity or god's hand as the cause of Vishap's death, which absorbed the water, the treasures that were guarded, and released the sacrificial virgins. Thus, old Egyptian myth regards Vishap as a power of darkness, who is defeated by the sun goddess [[Rán]]. As for Armenian myth, [[Vahagn]], the dragon slayer, fights and wins the battle against Vishap. The Vishap battle myths have spread across the Armenian population as an old folk tale (for example, Dikran and Aztahag, [[Daredevils of Sassoun]]). They have also had an influence in Christian literature. According to legend, Vishap's death and virgin sacrifice saves [[Saint George]]. Other legend says Vishap is presented as a Sun, who is a bad and destructive force, that the angels fight with (thunder as a symbol of the fight, the lightning as Archangel [[Gabriel]]'s flashing sword, the sparks as a fiery arrow, and the rainbow as the bow).

According to [[Manuk Abeghian]], Vishaps have been donated to Pantheon's beloved goddess, [[Astghik]]. As for [[Grigor Ghapantsyan]], they symbolize the dying and resurrecting god, [[Ara the Beautiful]].&lt;ref name="mshag"&gt;Armenia's Ancient Heritage, Patmamshakuytain Heritage Series, Volume 7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vishaps in Armenia ==
Found in [[Armenia]]'s [[Gegham mountains]], [[Lake Sevan]]'s north-east coast, [[Mount Aragats]]'s slopes, [[Garni]], the valley of [[Çoruh River]], as well as other places, where they used to worship  Vishap stones in ancient times. They are obvious with "Vishap" names. They were carved from massive stones (the biggest being 5.06m high), in a fish form, with a snake, bull, ram, stork, etc, as well as bird sculptures, usually placed in fountains, canals, reservoirs, and artificial lakes nearby. It can be assumed that these slabs were supporting agriculture and irrigation, by worshipping personal water deities.

== Discovery of Vishaps ==
Vishaps were introduced by the Armenian writer [[Atrpet]] in 1880. His work was published in 1926. In 1909, when [[Nicholas Marr]] and Yakov Smirnov's visited Armenia's [[Temple of Garni]] for a paleontological excavation, the local residents heard stories about the Vishaps that lived in the tall mountains. Scientists organized the expedition, climbed the [[Gegham mountains]], to confirm the existence Vishaps and whether they have any scientific significance or not. The findings in the Gegham mountains were published in 1931.&lt;ref name="ՎՔ"&gt;Armen Petrosyan, Arsen Bobokhyan  «The Vishap Stelae» Yerevan, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientists in the mountains discovered megalithic stone sculptures, which the Armenians called "Vishap" and the Kurds "giant Yurt",  and were mostly in the form of a fish. The biggest Vishap measured 4.75m high, and 55cm wide. In 1909, all the Vishaps were destroyed, and a part of them were buried in the soil.

Soon, other expeditions that were organized on the Gegham mountains found more Vishaps. In 1910, Nicholas Marr and Yakov Smirnov had already found 27 similar megalithic sculptures. There were similar Vishaps discovered in Armenia's [[Lake Sevan]], southern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and eastern [[Turkey]].

== Timeline ==
Determining how old Vishaps are is particularly difficult. The monuments are placed away from neighborhoods, whose radiocarbon analysis of the organic residues would enable them to determine the approximate age. Suddenly, on the giant Yurt's premiere Vishap that was found, there was images of the cross and Armenian letters dated from the 13th Century. The position of the cross and the writings show that in the 13th Century, the Vishap was still in the upright position. In 1963, in the Garni area a Vishap was excavated, which had King [[Argishti I of Urartu]]'s [[cuneiform]] inscription. This Vishap is dated 2 BC to 1 BC. &lt;ref name="Пиотровский"&gt;Пиотровский Б. Б. Вишапы. Каменные статуи в горах Армении, Издание Армянского филиала АН СССР, Ленинград, 1939 {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms and Sizes ==
[[File:Vishapakar (Dragonstone)2, Nor Nork.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Vishap in Yerevan's Nor Nork area]]
All the findings are carved on one stone, that is within 3-5m high. Most of the Vishaps are in a fish form that resembles a catfish. Basically, the carved details represent the fish eyes, mouth, tail, and gills. Another portion of the Vishaps are pictured as a hoofed animal such as a bull or ram and may represent a sacrifice, with various cases only pictured as stakes on the stretched animal skin. On other Vishaps, there are waves symbolizing water, which often come out of the mouth of the bull, long-legged birds, and rare snakes.

=== Three Main Types of Vishaps ===
* Bull form (square, thick plate form, the front is mainly a bull's head and fallen down limbs image)
* Fish form (oval, carved in the shape of the fish, contains features unique to the fish anatomy) 
* Fish-Bull Form (contains both of the forms)&lt;ref name="Heritage"&gt;[http://rcchd.icomos.org.ge/?l=G&amp;m=4-4&amp;JID=3&amp;AID=26&amp;l2 Vishap stones. Armenia's tallest monuments and their preservation issue]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Vishap stones are found fallen down in a horizontal position, lying down. However, the three forms listed above are designed and carved on all sides. The tails of the fish forms of the Vishap stones suggests that they were also once in a standing position.&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt;

== The Vishaps and The Canals ==
[[File:Սուրբ Աստվածածին-Աղավնաձոր.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Aghavnadzor khatchkar transformed into two vishaps]]
The Vishaps are monuments used to worship water, which are believe to have a close tie to water distribution. Almost all the Vishaps are found in places related to mountain springs or canals.&lt;ref&gt;Ashkharbek Calendar, Stone Age in Armenia, Water Worship, Yerevan, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there are irrigation systems found at [[Artanish Bay]], [[Mount Aragats]],the Tokhmakagan backwaters of the [[Gegham mountains]], and near Gemerzek settlements. Although it is impossible to precisely date the irrigation systems, scientists have linked the Vishaps to ancient fertility and water worship.&lt;ref name="Пиотровский"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Марр1931"&gt;''Марр, Николай Яковлевич'', ''Смирнов, Яков Иванович'' Вишапы // Труды Государственной Академии Истории Материальной Культуры, т. I, Ленинград, 1931 {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similarities to Other Structures ==
Scientists have noticed similarities between Vishaps and [[menhirs]] in [[North Caucasus]] and [[Europe]]. There are also similarities with monuments found in northern [[Mongolia]]. However, compared to the other structures listed above, Vishaps have a completely other purpose and have been clearly established by other tribes.&lt;ref name="Пиотровский"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Мещанинов1926"&gt;''Мещанинов, Иван Иванович'' Каменные статуи рыб — вишапы на Кавказе и в Северной Монголии // Записки Коллегии Востоковедов, I, Ленинград, 1926 {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wave Energy Scotland''' (WES) is a technology development body set up by the [[Scottish Government]] to facilitate the development of [[wave energy]] in [[Scotland]]. It was set up in 2015 and is a subsidiary of [[Highlands and Islands Enterprise]] (HIE) based in [[Inverness]]. WES manages a number of projects resulting from its pre-commercial procurement funding calls.

== Inception ==

The Scottish Government took positive action to support the ailing wave energy sector in Scotland, following the demise of one of the leading developers [[Pelamis Wave Power]]. The Energy Minister [[Fergus Ewing]] announced an initial budget for the body of £14.3 million over 13 months at the [[RenewableUK]] conference in February 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.gov.scot/news/over-14-million-for-wave-energy-scotland|title=Over £14 million for Wave Energy Scotland|date=25 February 2015|website=The Scottish Government|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation objectives ==

The original objectives for WES were set out by the Scottish Government as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0046/00464410.pdf|title=Wave Energy Scotland Fact Sheet|website=The Scottish Government|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Seek to retain the intellectual property and know-how from device development in Scotland for future benefit;
* Enable Scotland’s indigenous technologies to reach commercial readiness in the most efficient and effective manner, and in a way that allows the public sector to exit in due course;
* Ensure that the learning gained from support for wave device development and deployment to date, in particular the learning from Scotland’s leading wave technologies, is retained and used to benefit the wave energy industry;
* Avoid duplication in funding, encourage collaboration between companies and research institutes and foster greater standardisation across the industry;
* Ensure value for money from public sector investment; and
* Promote greater confidence in the technical performance of wave energy systems in order to encourage the return of private sector investment.

== Project calls ==

To date, WES has held four funding calls,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hie.co.uk/growth-sectors/energy/wave-energy-scotland/project-calls.html|title=Project calls|website=Wave Energy Scotland|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; .
