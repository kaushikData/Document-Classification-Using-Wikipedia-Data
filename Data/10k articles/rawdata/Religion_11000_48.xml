'''Aba I''' (or, with his Syriac honorific, '''Mar Aba I''') or '''Mar Abba the Great''' was the [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Patriarch of the Church of the East]] at [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] from 540 to 552.&lt;ref name="Bened"/&gt; He introduced to the church the [[Anaphora (liturgy)|anaphoras]] of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] and [[Nestorius]] beside the more ancient liturgical rite of [[Liturgy of Addai and Mari|Addai and Mari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of World Religions |first=Bruno |last=Becchio |author2=Johannes P. Schadé |publisher=Foreign Media Group |isbn=1-60136-000-2 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though his tenure as catholicos saw Christians in the region threatened during the Persian-Roman wars and attempts by both [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persian]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rulers to interfere with the governance of the church, his reign is reckoned a period of consolidation,&lt;ref name=tcote/&gt; and a synod he held in 544 as (despite excluding the Diocese of Merv) instrumental in unifying and strengthening the church.&lt;ref name="Rassam"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Suha |last=Rassam |title=Christianity in Iraq |page=37 |isbn=0-85244-633-0 |publisher=Gracewing |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is thought to have written and translated a number of religious works.&lt;ref name=tcote/&gt;&lt;ref name=isaac&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Sacrifice of Isaac |page=115 |publisher=Brill |year=2002 |first=Edward |last=Noort |isbn=90-04-12434-9 |author2=[[Eibert Tigchelaar|Eibert J. C. Tigchelaar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death in February 552, the faithful carried his casket from his simple home across the Tigris to the monastery of Mar Pithyon.

Aba is a highly regarded and significantly venerated saint in the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], the [[Ancient Church of the East]], and the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], which has named a seminary in [[San Diego, California]], USA, after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaldu.org/2_st_peter_diocese/churches/MarAbba_Seminary.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816010206/http://www.kaldu.org/2_st_peter_diocese/churches/MarAbba_Seminary.htm |archivedate=2009-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[feast day]] is celebrated on both the seventh Friday after [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] and on February 28.

He is documented in the ''[[Ausgewählte Akten Persischer Märtyrer]]'', and ''[[The Lesser Eastern Churches]]'', two biographies of Eastern saints.

==Early life==
Born in a [[Zoroastrian]] family of [[Persian people|Persian]] origin&lt;ref&gt;Manichaeism in the Later Roman Empire and Medieval China, ed. Samuel N. C. Lieu (1992), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greatrex &amp; Lieu  (2002), p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; in Hala, Mesopotamia. Mar Aba was secretary to the governor of [[Beth Garmai]] province before he converted to Christianity, studied, and later taught at the [[School of Nisibis]].&lt;ref name=tcote&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Church of the East |first=Wilhelm |last=Baum |author2=Dietmar Winkler |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |pages=33–34 |isbn=0-415-29770-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highly regarded as a scholar,&lt;ref name=tcote/&gt; he studied Greek in Edessa and is attributed with the translation (or with having overseen the translation) of key texts, including the works of Theodore and [[Nestorius]], from Greek into [[Syriac language|Syriac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Eucharistic prayer of Addai and Mari |page=23 |first=A |last=Gelston |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1992 |ISBN=0-19-826737-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also remembered as the author of original works including Biblical commentaries, homilies, and synodal letters.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1913 |title =Syriac Language and Literature |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=The Encyclopedia Press |location= |id= |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Syriac_Language_and_Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentaries of Theodore==
He favoured the Biblical interpretation and commentaries of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]], at the time a controversial position: the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian]] attempted to meet with Mar Aba around 532 (before his installation as patriarch) to persuade him to denounce Theodore's teachings. Justinian was preparing to [[anathema]]tize Theodore and his works, obviously in sharp opposition to Mar Aba's own views. Acquiescence to Justinian's demands would also have been politically undesirable for Mar Aba, whose [[Church of the East]] had secured independence from the Christian west (which Justinian represented) at the Council of Dadisho in 424.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=M. J. |last=Birnie |title=The Church of the East and Theodore of  Mopsuestia: the commitment to his writings and its implications for dialogue |journal=Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies| volume=10 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mar Aba was not at the meeting.

==544 Synod==
Aba's tenure as catholicos followed a 15-year period of schism within the church, during which remote areas had elected their own rival bishops. Aba was able to resolve this schism, visiting the disputed areas and negotiating agreements to reunite the church.&lt;ref name="Bened"&gt;{{Cite book |title=New Westminster Dictionary of Church History |first=Robert |last=Benedetto |author2=James O. Duke |isbn=0-664-22416-4 |page=406 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 544, he convened a synod to ratify these agreements; the synod agreed that the metropolitans of those regions under the See of Seleucia-Ctesiphon would, in the future, elect catholicoi at formal meetings. This agreement was, however, substantially subverted in later years, not least when the Persian ruler [[Khosrau I]] influenced the selection of Joseph, Aba's successor as catholicos.&lt;ref name=tcote/&gt;

The acts of the synod also documented an "orthodoxy of faith", written by Aba himself. Some of its prescriptions indicate the particularly Persian character of the church in the East,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Paradise and Paradigm |first=Christopher |last=Buck |publisher=SUNY |year=1999 |page=6 |isbn=0-7914-4061-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including a set of marriage rules prohibiting unions between close kin, apparently formulated in deliberate response to Zoroastrian practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Iraq After the Muslim Conquest |first=Michael G. |last=Morony |authorlink=Michael G. Morony|publisher=Gorgias Press |year=2005 |ISBN=1-59333-315-3 |page=364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tensions with Persia and Rome==
Tensions between the Persian and Byzantine empires ran high during Mar Aba's lifetime, and, after hostilities between the two intensified in the 540s, persecution of Christians in Persia became more common. Zoroastrians hostile to Aba as an [[apostate]] pressured Khosrau to act against him, and, as punishment for [[proselytizing]] among the Zoroastrians, Aba was placed under house arrest and eventually exiled to [[Adurbadagan]] (Azarbaijan). He was allowed to return to the See after seven years and continued as Catholicos until 552,&lt;ref name="Bened"/&gt; when he died — in some accounts, as a result of torture and exposure inflicted during his imprisonment.

==Seminary==

The first seminary of the Chaldean Catholic Church outside of Iraq was established in July 2008 in [[El Cajon, California|El Cajon, San Diego]], as the [[Seminary of Mar Abba the Great]].

'''Adi''' ([[Skt.]], 'first') is a Hindu, Buddhist, and Theosophical term meaning the first part of reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], ''A Textbook of Theosophy'', Madras, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; It has to do with the [[first cause]] or even [[causeless cause|Adi-Ananta]]—at least as unity of infinity (as Plotinus and others say) emanating the first finite one.  This is called [[Brahman#Semantics and pronunciation|Brahm]] (in Hinduism) and [[Adi-Buddha]], and Theosophy also says it has to do with the [[divinity|Divine]] [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]], e.g. [[Logos]].

The '''Ahkiyyini''' is a skeleton spirit in [[Inuit mythology|Inuit folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ahkiyyini" ''Encyclopédie du Paranormal'' (http://www.paranormal-encyclopedie.com/wiki/Articles/Ahkiyyini)&lt;/ref&gt; Men who spend much of their time dancing or playing drums in life may continue to do so in death as an ahkiyyini. To make music, an ahkiyyini uses his arm bone as a drumstick to beat his [[scapula]], which acts as a drum or xylophone. When he strikes this improvised instrument, the ahkiyyini causes the ground to tremble and rivers to turn violent, wrecking ships and killing their passengers.

'''Andrew Jenson''', born '''Anders Jensen''', (December 11, 1850 – November 18, 1941) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] immigrant to the United States who acted as an [[Assistant Church Historian]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) for much of the early-20th century. Jenson also served the church as [[Mission president|president]] of the [[Scandinavia]]n [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]].

==Early life==
Anders Jensen was born in Torslev parish, [[Hjørring]], Denmark. His parents joined the LDS Church when he was four.  He left Denmark for the United States in 1866. He traveled across the North American [[Great Plains]] in Andrew H. Scott's ox company.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jenson, ''Encyclopedic History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'', 1941, p. v&lt;/ref&gt; On coming to [[Utah Territory]] he anglicized his name to ''Andrew Jenson'' and settled in the [[Salt Lake Valley]].

==Missionary==
In 1873, Jenson was ordained a [[Seventy (LDS Church)|seventy]] in the LDS Church by [[George Q. Cannon]] and sent on a [[Missionary (LDS Church)|mission]] to Denmark. In 1876, he translated the history of [[Joseph Smith]] into [[Danish language|Danish]]. Jenson served a second mission to Denmark from 1879 to 1881. While in Denmark, Jenson established a monthly periodical called ''Morgenstjernen'', which he continued to publish in Utah after his return. After eight years, the periodical changed its name to the ''Historical Record'' and was published in English.

==Church historian==
In 1886, Jenson became a part-time employee of the LDS Church, receiving a small monthly allowance.  His assignments included conducting interviews and gathering photographs, historic documents, and other documentation during a trip to historic church sites in the eastern United States.  Jenson also gathered similar documents from various church [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]] and missions throughout the church, which led to the writing of a manuscript history for each LDS Church [[Ward (LDS Church)|ward]] and stake.  Jenson was appointed as a full-time [[Assistant Church Historian]] in 1897. Along with [[John Jaques (Mormon)|John Jaques]], Jenson was the Acting Church Historian from 1899 until the appointment of [[Anthon H. Lund]] as Church Historian in 1900.  Jenson would continue on again as Assistant Church Historian until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bitton, Davis|authorlink=Davis Bitton|title=An Indefatigable Dane Pursues the Past|publisher=Meridian Magazine|year=2002|url=http://www.meridianmagazine.com/historybits/030130jenson.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107120626/http://ldsmag.com/historybits/030130jenson.html|archivedate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in the Church Historian's office, Jenson was a prolific writer, presenting the history of the Latter-day Saints from an orthodox perspective. He was also a remarkable archivist of historical material and continued to collect records and diaries for the Church Historian's office.

Jenson compiled the four-volume ''[[Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia]]'', a church chronology and an early Latter-day Saint [[biographical dictionary]].  He was also closely involved with the compilation of the ''Journal History of the Church'', which has been described by Utah [[Historiography|historiographer]] Gary Topping as ''...an immense scrapbook compilation consisting of several hundred volumes of various historical records (in its later years mostly newspaper clippings) documenting Mormon history from the beginning of the church until well into the twentieth century.''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Topping|2003|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenson's contribution included its chronological organization and a running subject index on thousands of index cards.  He also compiled the "Encyclopedic History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints".  Among the men he worked with in Church Historian's office was [[Joseph Fielding Smith]], who later served as Church Historian and eventually as [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]].

During the 1890s, Jenson collected all the records he could find concerning the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]].  This archive including his own field notes, excerpts of witnesses' diaries, [[affidavit]]s, newspaper reports, and the transcriptions from the LDS Church's internal investigations. Many participants in the massacre were granted complete confidentiality for the contents of these interview transcriptions.  Since Jenson's time, these files were closed to the public and were not available for use by historians.  However, in August 2008, LDS historians [[Ronald W. Walker]], [[Richard E. Turley Jr.]], and [[Glen M. Leonard]] published ''[[Massacre at Mountain Meadows]]'' through [[Oxford University Press]]. A decade in the making, research for the book finally draws from the Jenson archive.

The '''Ayotha Amirtha Gangai''' is a mythical river found in the text [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]], the source of [[Ayyavazhi mythology]]. Ayotha Amirtha Gangai was located in [[Ayotha Amirtha Vanam]], the place where [[Thirumal]], through the instrumentality of the [[Seven Virgins]], [[Santror Pirappu|gave birth]] to the [[Santror Makkal]]. The land is surrounded by [[Sri Rangam]] in the north, [[Mount Thirikonam]] in the south, [[Puttaapuram]] in the east and [[Poonkavu]] in the west.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19008">'''Bishop''' is the highest priesthood office of the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic priesthood]] in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. It is almost always held by one who already holds the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] office of [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priest]]. The Latter Day Saint concept of the office differs significantly from the role of [[bishop]]s in other [[Christian]] denominations, being in some respects more analogous to a [[pastor]] or [[Priest#Christian Traditions|parish priest]]. Each bishop serves with two counselors, which together form a '''bishopric'''.

The role of a bishop varies in the different Latter Day Saint denominations; however, they derive from a common history.

== History of the office ==
[[Edward Partridge]] became the first man called to the office of bishop in the early Latter Day Saint [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|church]] on February 4, 1831. The duties of the office were to oversee the temporal affairs and accounts of the church through the implementation of the law of consecration. Partridge was called to preside over the Missouri church in [[Joseph Smith]]'s absence and soon thereafter Partridge and his family emigrated to the church's growing colony in [[Jackson County, Missouri]], where he continued to act as bishop of the branch of the church. [[Newel K. Whitney]] was then called as a bishop to oversee the temporal affairs of the church in [[Kirtland, Ohio]].

When the Latter Day Saints were headquartered in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], the membership was separated into three "[[Ward (Mormonism)|wards]]" or geographical precincts ("Upper," "Middle" and "Lower"), and a bishop was called to oversee the temporal affairs of each ward. Partridge presided over the "Upper Ward," Whitney presided over the "Middle Ward" and [[Vinson Knight]] presided over the "Lower Ward."&lt;ref&gt;See Jessee ''et al.'', ''Joseph Smith Papers:Journals, Volume 1 1832-1839'', pp.&amp;nbsp;455–60&lt;/ref&gt; Over time in the church's history, the position of [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishop]] was created. Partridge is considered the church's "First Presiding Bishop", although neither he nor his contemporaries saw him as a superior to other bishops of the church in that time period.

After the [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|1844 succession crisis]], the offices of bishop and presiding bishop developed separately in the various resulting denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hartley |first=William G. |title=Bishop, History of the Office |contribution-url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5911 |pages= 119-122 |editor1-last=Ludlow |editor1-first=Daniel H. |editor1-link=Daniel H. Ludlow |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] |year=1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Levitical bishops ==
According to Latter Day Saint scripture, a bishop in the church does not need to be a [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priest]] nor does he need counselors if he is a [[Levite]] and a direct descendant of [[Aaron]], the brother of [[Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/68.14-21#13 68:14–21].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Joseph Fielding Smith]] taught that this provision applied only to the [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishop]] of the church and not to bishops of [[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-60-68/section-68-scripture-is-the-will-mind-word-voice-and-power-of-god-unto-salvation "Section 68: Scripture Is the Will, Mind, Word, Voice, and Power of God unto Salvation"], ''Doctrine and Covenants Scripture Manual'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: [[Church Educational System]], 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Presiding Bishop of the [[Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]], W. Kevin Romer, is recognized as a “literal descendant of Aaron” and holds the title of Aaronic High Priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theremnantchurch.com/index.php/doctrine-covenants/319-section-r-161|title=Remnant Doctrine and Covenants section R-161|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bishops in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==
In the largest Latter Day Saint denomination, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), bishops are [[Calling (Mormonism)|called]] from among the members of a local congregation, known as a [[ward (LDS Church)|ward]], and traditionally serve, without pay, for four to seven years (the length of service varies). A bishop must be a married [[High Priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priest]] in the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]]. The bishop acts as the presiding high priest of the ward. A bishop simultaneously serves as the president of the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic priesthood]] and president of the [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priests quorum]] in the ward. In a [[Ward (LDS Church)|branch]], the [[branch president]] fulfills the same functions as a bishop; however, a branch president does not need to be a high priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Pearson |first= Don M. |contribution= Bishop |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5515 |pages= 117-118 |editor1-last= Ludlow |editor1-first= Daniel H |editor1-link= Daniel H. Ludlow |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] |year= 1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The bishop is often called "the father of the ward"&lt;ref name = packer&gt;[[Boyd K. Packer]], [//www.lds.org/ensign/1999/05/the-bishop-and-his-counselors "The Bishop and His Counselors"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; as he is the priesthood leader who is most intimately involved with individual church members. The bishop is not paid for the time he devotes to his position. All local positions in the LDS Church operate as a lay ministry; members donate their time to perform the duties assigned with each calling. Each bishop serves with two counselors, which together form a bishopric. The counselors to a bishop are generally high priests, but there are exceptions, such as in a [[Single adult (LDS Church)#Young single adult wards|singles ward]], where the counselors may be [[elder (Latter Day Saints)|elders]].

The immediate priesthood leader of the bishop is the [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake president]], who provides direction, training and counsel to the bishops of the wards within his stake boundaries; the stake president is assisted in these duties by two counselors and the [[High Council (Mormonism)|stake high council]]. New bishops are recommended by the stake president, but each bishop is formally approved by and called in writing by the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]]. Prior to ordination, the proposed ordination of a bishop must also be accepted by [[common consent (Latter Day Saints)|common consent]] by the members of the ward.

===Duties===
The bishop holds the primary responsibility for everything in the ward, both spiritually and temporally. Although he can delegate specific assignments to his counselors, the ultimate responsibility falls to him. His duties include presiding over and conducting meetings and worship services; serving as president of the ward's quorum of [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priests]]; acting as a "judge in Israel" or "common judge"; providing temporary financial relief for ward members; serving as the presiding [[High Priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priest]] of the ward; and organizing and managing the ward's [[auxiliary organization (LDS Church)|auxiliary organizations]]. After being called, a bishop is ordained a high priest (if he does not already hold that priesthood office) and then ordained a bishop and [[Setting apart|set apart]] as the bishop and presiding high priest of the specific ward. He is also given the priesthood "keys" which authorize him to serve as a representative for the Lord in performing his duties. The ordinations, setting apart, and the conferral of keys is performed by the [[laying on of hands]] by the stake president. After a bishop is released from his responsibilities over the ward, he retains the priesthood office of bishop for life.&lt;ref name = packer/&gt;

*'''Presiding over services''' – Each Sunday, the bishop is responsible for organizing the main worship service, called [[sacrament meeting]]. The bishop and his counselors select speakers from among the members of the ward, assigned [[High Council (Mormonism)|high council]] speakers, and, on occasion, guest speakers. The bishop or his counselors may also speak in sacrament meeting. A member of the bishopric conducts the meeting, introduces the speakers and occasionally concludes the meeting with a few remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Bradford |first= David C. |contribution= Bishopric |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5517 |pages= 122-123 |editor1-last= Ludlow |editor1-first= Daniel H |editor1-link= Daniel H. Ludlow |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] |year= 1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Once each month, normally the first Sunday of the month, a "fast and testimony meeting" is held and no specific speakers are assigned. Instead, those attending the ward that day are invited to stand and bear [[Testimony#Religious testimony|testimony]] of Jesus and his work and influence.
*'''President of the priests quorum''' – The bishop is the president of the [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic priesthood]] and the [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priests quorum]] in the ward. He selects two priests to serve as first and second assistants to the bishop. The bishop is responsible to prepare each priest to worthily serve as a [[Mormon missionary|missionary]] and to prepare to receive the [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] of the [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]]. He is also responsible for the spiritual and temporal learning of every young priesthood holder. As president of the priests quorum, he is responsible for new member baptisms and missionary work in the ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Ballantyne |first= Verfon W. |contribution= Aaronic Priesthood: Powers and Offices |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5438 |page= 1-3 |editor1-last= Ludlow |editor1-first= Daniel H |editor1-link= Daniel H. Ludlow |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]]|year= 1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Judge in Israel''' – Members are interviewed by their bishop in order to receive a [[Temple (LDS Church)#Requirements for entering LDS temples|temple recommend]]. The bishop signs the recommend to indicate that the member is following basic tenets of the church and is worthy to enter the [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]]. Additionally, members seek guidance from the bishop in overcoming personal challenges. Serious sins must be confessed to the bishop who helps members through the repentance process. In some cases, the bishop presides over a church [[disciplinary council]] where the outcome can include admonishment, probation, [[Excommunication#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|disfellowshipment, or excommunication]], depending on the severity of the sin and the attitude of the member. Additionally, the bishop also has the authority and duty to counsel members on spiritual matters, and sits as a "common judge" in the event of disputes between ward members. Bishops typically withdraw from involvement in matters which have been taken to the law.
*'''Provide temporally for the members of the ward''' – The bishop also has the responsibility to oversee the payment of [[tithing (Latter Day Saints)|tithes]] and [[Fast offering|offerings]] in a ward, including the duty to accurately account for all money donated. The bishop also has the authority to authorize financial assistance, specifically the disbursement of [[fast offering]]s donated to help the poor, and other assistance to members, according to the church's guidelines. The other assistance a bishop can provide is "in kind" assistance in the form of food and household goods from the [[bishop's storehouse]] (which is managed by the [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishop]] (see below). The bishop disburses funds, authorizes distribution of food from the bishop's storehouse, or provides other appropriate assistance after evaluating the needs of the family and the resources available in the ward.
*'''Serve as the presiding high priest for the ward''' – As the presiding [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priest]], the bishop leads meetings and has the priesthood authority to issue callings, approve the performance of ordinances such as baptisms and the administration of the [[Sacrament (Latter Day Saints)|sacrament]]. The high priests that reside in several wards that form a [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]] are part of a quorum led by the stake president. In the ward, the bishop gives direction to and coordinates the efforts of the [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elders]] quorum president in performing their duties. (In each stake the members of ward bishopric, members of the stake high council, and any functioning patriarch form the stake high priest quorum, presided over by members of the stake presidency.)
*'''Organize and manage the other organizations in the ward''' – The bishop is responsible for calling and setting apart a local president for each of the church's auxiliary organizations. These organizations are the [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]], [[Relief Society]], [[Young Men (organization)|Young Men]], [[Young Women (organization)|Young Women]], and [[Primary (LDS Church)|Primary]]. He also calls and sets apart [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic priesthood]] [[Quorum (Latter Day Saints)|quorum]] and Young Women class presidents. The bishopric then approves the recommendations made by each auxiliary or quorum president for two counselors, a secretary, instructors, and other callings within the organization. In doing this, the bishop strives to help manage the time donated by members of the ward.

=== Branch presidents ===
In small congregations that are not large enough to be a [[Ward (LDS Church)|ward]], a holder of the Melchizedek priesthood is usually [[Calling (LDS Church)|called]] to be a [[branch president]]. In rare instances where no worthy Melchizedek priesthood holder is available, a [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priest]] in the Aaronic priesthood may instead be called as the branch president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=LDS Church |url=//www.lds.org/manual/branch-guidebook/branch-presidency |title=Branch Guidebook |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |date=2001 |section=Branch Presidency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The branch president generally has the same responsibilities as a bishop and is assisted by two counselors.  A branch president and his counselors may or may not be a [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priest]], and a branch president is not ordained to the priesthood office of bishop.

=== Presiding Bishop ===
{{Main|Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)}}
{{See also|Presiding Bishop#Latter Day Saints|l1=Presiding Bishop: Latter Day Saints}}

The LDS Church also has a [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishopric]] which oversees the temporal affairs of the church (including its [[LDS Church Welfare Services|Welfare Services]]) and provides assistance and instruction to the various bishoprics worldwide.

=== Traveling bishops ===
The calling of "traveling bishop" was prominent during the early Utah period of church history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pace |first=D. Gene |jstor=43042343 |title=Changing Patterns of Mormon Financial Administration: Traveling Bishops, Regional Bishops, and Bishop's Agents, 1851–88 |journal=BYU Studies |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=183–195 |date=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traveling bishops were not assigned to a specific congregation, but were tasked to visit various wards and branches to take care and supervise over temporal matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pace |first1=Donald Gene |title=Commodities, Cash, and Clerics: Economic Priorities and Administrative Strategies in Nineteenth Century Utah |date=2009 |publisher=AuthorHouse |location=Bloomington, IN |isbn=9781449017712 |page=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bishops in the Community of Christ==
In many ways bishops of the [[Community of Christ]] continue to resemble those found in the church prior to the [[death of Joseph Smith]]. They are not pastors or branch presidents, but financial officers and ministers of stewardship. While in theory a literal descendant of Aaron could hold this office, no such claim has ever been made, and therefore all bishops are members of the high priesthood, as a high priest can serve in any "lesser office". All bishops are members of the Order of Bishops, with presidency vested in the Presiding Bishopric (consisting of the Presiding Bishop and two counselors). 

While all bishops are attached to a congregation (in the sense that every member of the church has a home congregation), bishops are not congregational officers, but preside as financial officers over larger jurisdictions, or support those who do. For example, each mission center will have a bishop in charge of all the finances of that area, who may or may not be assisted by other bishops. Likewise, some nations have a national bishop, and, historically, stakes also had bishops. Consequently, this makes the office of bishop somewhat uncommon. In recent years, some mission centers have had multiple bishops in order to help promote the various ministries associated with good stewardship.  

Other bishops have been appointed as "field bishops" who are assigned to assist one of the [[Council of Twelve Apostles (Community of Christ)|twelve apostles]]. The Presiding Bishopric is also regarded as the presidency of the entire Aaronic priesthood. Bishops in general are therefore sometimes seen as ideal resources to provide support and mentoring to local members of the Aaronic priesthood.

'''''Brahmacharya''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|r|ɑː|m|ə|ˈ|tʃ|ɑr|j|ə}}; [[Devanagari]]: [[wikt:ब्रह्मचर्य|ब्रह्मचर्य]]) is a concept within [[Indian religions]] that literally means "conduct consistent with [[Brahma]]"&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Brahmacharya" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, pp. 120, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|9780823931798}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In one context, ''brahmacharya'' is the first of four ''[[ashrama (stage)|ashrama]]'' (age-based stages) of a human life, with ''[[grihastha]]'' (householder), ''[[vanaprastha]]'' (forest dweller), and ''[[sannyasa]]'' (renunciation) being the other three ''asramas''. The ''brahmacharya'' (bachelor student) stage of life – from childhood up to twenty-five years of age – was focused on education and included the practice of [[celibacy]].&lt;ref name=rks&gt;RK Sharma (1999), Indian Society, Institutions and Change, {{ISBN|978-8171566655}}, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it connotes [[chastity]] during the student stage of life for the purposes of learning from a ''[[guru]]'' (teacher), and during later stages of life for the purposes of attaining spiritual liberation (Sanskrit: ''[[moksha]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Feuerstein]], ''The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra'', Shambhala Publications, {{ISBN|978-1590308790}}, 2011, pg 76, Quote – "Brahmacharya essentially stands for the ideal of chastity"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Johnson (2009), "The chaste and celibate state of a student of the ''Veda''", Oxford Dictionary of Hinduism, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-2713223273}}, pg 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In another context, ''brahmacharya'' is the [[virtue]] of celibacy when unmarried and [[fidelity]] when married.&lt;ref name=caf/&gt;&lt;ref name=brahmacarya2&gt;'''[a]''' Louise Taylor (2001), A Woman's Book of Yoga, Tuttle, {{ISBN|978-0804818292}}, page 3;&lt;br&gt;'''[b]'''Jeffrey Long (2009), Jainism: An Introduction, IB Tauris, {{ISBN|978-1845116262}}, page 109; Quote: The fourth vow – brahmacarya – means for laypersons, marital fidelity and pre-marital celibacy; for ascetics, it means absolute celibacy; John Cort explains, "Brahmacharya involves having sex only with one's spouse, as well as the avoidance of ardent gazing or lewd gestures (...) — Quoted by Long, ibid, page 101&lt;/ref&gt; It represents a virtuous lifestyle that also includes simple living, meditation and other behaviors.&lt;ref name=mkha/&gt;&lt;ref name=joseph/&gt;

In the Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist monastic traditions, ''brahmacharya'' implies, among other things, the mandatory renunciation of sex and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Olson (2007), Celibacy and Religious Traditions, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195306323}}, page 227-233&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered necessary for a monk's spiritual practice.&lt;ref&gt;DR Pattanaik (1998), The Holy Refusal, MELUS, Vol. 23, No. 2, 113–127&lt;/ref&gt; Western notions of the religious life as practiced in monastic settings mirror these characteristics.

==Etymology==
The word ''brahmacharya'' stems from two Sanskrit roots:
#''[[Brahman]]'' is what god is called in the Vedas, the main Hindu scriptures.
#''charya'' (चर्य), which means "occupation with, engaging, proceeding, behaviour, conduct, to follow, going after".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html carya] Monier Williams Sanskrit Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; This is often translated as activity, conduct, or mode of behaviour.

In ancient and medieval era Indian texts, the term ''brahmacharya'' is a concept with a more complex meaning indicating an overall lifestyle conducive to the pursuit of sacred knowledge and spiritual liberation.&lt;ref name=mkha/&gt; ''Brahmacharya'' is a means, not an end. It usually includes cleanliness, [[ahimsa]], simple living, studies, meditation, and voluntary restraints on certain foods, intoxicants, and behaviors (including sexual behavior).&lt;ref name=mkha&gt;M Khandelwal (2001), Sexual Fluids, Emotions, Morality – Notes on the Gendering of Brahmacharya, in Celibacy, Culture, and Society: The Anthropology of Sexual Abstinence (Editors: Elisa Sobo and Sandra Bell), University of Wisconsin Press, {{ISBN|978-0299171643}}, pages 157–174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=joseph&gt;Joseph Alter (2012), Moral Materialism, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0143417415}}, pages 65–67&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a virtue==
''Brahmacharya'' is traditionally regarded as one of the five [[yamas]] in [[Yoga]], as declared in verse 2.30 of Patanjali's [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sutras]].&lt;ref&gt;Original:अहिंसासत्यास्तेय ब्रह्मचर्यापरिग्रहाः यमाः |&lt;br&gt;Source:{{cite book|last1=Āgāśe|first1=K. S.|title=Pātañjalayogasūtrāṇi|date=1904|publisher=Ānandāśrama|location=Puṇe|page=102| url=https://archive.org/stream/patanjaliyoga/yoga_sutras_three_commentaries#page/n111/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of self-restraint regarded as a virtue, and an observance recommended depending on an individual's context. For a married practitioner it means marital fidelity (not cheating on one's spouse); for a single person it means celibacy.&lt;ref name=caf&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/himalayanacademy/sacredhinduliterature/lws/lws_ch-10.html Brahmacharyam Pativratyam cha – Celibacy and Fidelity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630071725/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/himalayanacademy/sacredhinduliterature/lws/lws_ch-10.html |date=30 June 2013 }} Himalayan Academy, Gutenberg Archives (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brahmacarya2/&gt; Sandilya [[Upanishad]] includes ''brahmacharya'' as one of ten [[yamas]] in Chapter 1, defining it as "refraining from sexual intercourse in all places and in all states in mind, speech or body".&lt;ref&gt;KN Aiyar (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/thirtyminorupani00xxxxuoft#page/n189/mode/2up Sandilya Upanishad], Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Archives, page 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Patanjali in verse 2.38&lt;ref&gt;Original: ब्रह्मचर्य प्रतिष्ठायां वीर्यलाभः |&lt;br&gt;Source: [http://vedanta-yoga.de/yoga-sutras-yamas-ashtanga-ahimsa/ Yogasutra 2.35–2.39] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; states that the virtue of brahmacharya leads to the profit of ''virya'' (वीर्य).&lt;ref name=svb&gt;SV Bharti (2001), Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: With the Exposition of Vyasa, Motilal Banarsidas, {{ISBN|978-8120818255}}, Appendix I, pages 536–539&lt;/ref&gt; This Sanskrit word, ''virya'', has been variously translated as virility and, by [[Vyasa]], as strength and capacity. Vyasa explains that this virtue promotes other good qualities.&lt;ref name=svb/&gt; Other ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism describe the fruits of this virtue differently. For example, Pada Chandrika, Raja Marttanda, Sutrartha Bodhini, Mani Prabha and Yoga Sudhakara each state that ''brahmacharya'' must be understood as the voluntary restraint of power.&lt;ref name=svb/&gt; [[Chandogya Upanishad]] in verses of chapter 8.5 extols ''brahmacharya'' as a sacrament and sacrifice which, once perfected, leads to realization of the soul or Self (Atman), and thereafter becomes the habit of experiencing the soul in others and everything.&lt;ref name=svb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Shankara.Bhashya-Chandogya.Upanishad-Ganganath.Jha.1942.English#page/n449/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad] Book 8, Chapter 5, Jha (Translator), pages 434–440&lt;/ref&gt; Tattva Vaisharadi and Yoga Sarasangraha assert that ''brahmacharya'' leads to and increase in ''jñana-shakti'' (power of knowledge) and ''kriya-shakti'' (power of action).&lt;ref name=svb/&gt;

The great epic [[Mahabharata]] describes the objective of brahmacharya as knowledge of [[Brahman]] (Book Five, [[Udyoga Parva]], the Book of Effort).&lt;ref name=kmg/&gt; Brahmacharya leads one to union with the Supreme Soul or Self (Chapter 43). By subduing desire, the practice of self-restraint enables the student to learn, pay attention in [[Manasa, vacha, karmana|thought, word and deed]] to the ''guru'' (teacher), and discover the truth embodied in the Vedas and Upanishads. According to the epic, the practice of studying and learning requires the "aid of time," as well as personal effort, ability, discussion, and practice, all of which are helped by the virtue of brahmacharya.&lt;ref name=kmg/&gt; A brahmacharya should do useful work, and the earnings he obtains should be given away as ''dakshina'' ("fee," "gift of thanks") to the guru. The epic declares that brahmacharya is one of twelve virtues, an essential part of ''angas'' in [[yoga]] and the path of perfecting perseverance and the pursuit of knowledge.&lt;ref name=kmg&gt;KM Ganguli (Translator), {{Google books|OrpZAAAAMAAJ|The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa|page=150}}, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 43, pages 150–153&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Jainism ==
[[File:In-jain.svg|alt=Jain Flag Photo|thumb|Green colour in the [[Jain flag]] stands for ''brahmacharya''{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=iv}}]]
''Brahmacharya'' is one of the five major vows prescribed for the ''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|śrāvakā]]'' (layman) and ascetics in [[Jainism]]. For those Jains who adopt the path of monks, celibacy in action, words and thoughts is expected. For lay Jains who are married, the virtue of ''brahmacharya'' requires remaining sexually faithful to one's chosen partner.&lt;ref name=pshah/&gt; For lay Jains who are unmarried, chaste living requires Jains to avoid sex before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Brahmacarya |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/living/brahmacarya.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Uttam Brahmacharya'' (Supreme Celibacy) is one of the ten excellencies of a ''[[Digambara monk]]''.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1926|p=64}} ''Brahmacharya'' is mentioned as one of the ''das [[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]'' (ten virtues) in ancient Jain texts like ''[[Tattvartha Sutra]]'', ''[[Sarvārthasiddhi]]'' and ''[[Puruşārthasiddhyupāya]]''.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=145-147}}

==Among Sramanic traditions==
Among the [[sramana|sramanic traditions]] ([[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Ājīvika]] and Carvaka schools ), ''brahmacharya'' is the term used for a self-imposed practice of celibacy generally considered a prerequisite for [[sadhana|spiritual practice]]. The fourth of the five great vows of [[Jain monk]]s, for example, is the vow of celibacy, which in this case means a total abstinence from the sensual pleasure of all five senses, including the avoidance of sexual thoughts and desires.&lt;ref name=pshah&gt;Pravin Shah, [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/5greatvows.htm Five Great Vows (Maha-vratas) of Jainism] Jainism Literature Center, Harvard University Archives (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kolb (2007), Encyclopedia of Business Ethics and Society, SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-1412916523}}, page 1207-1208&lt;/ref&gt; The [[yogin]] who is firmly grounded in the virtue of ''brahmacharya'' is said to gain great vitality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shambhala Encyclopedia of Yoga|page= 61|author=Georg Feuerstein|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i7yoPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Shambhala+Encyclopedia+of+Yoga%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2wynVP6sDpCDNvTggOAM&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As Asrama stage of life==
{{Main|Ashrama (stage)}}
Historically ''brahmacarya'' referred to a stage of life ''(asrama)'' within the [[Vedic ashram system]]. Ancient [[Hindu culture]] divided the human lifespan into four stages: ''Brahmacharya'', ''[[Grihastha]]'', ''[[Vanaprastha]]'' and ''[[Sannyasa]]''. ''Brahamacharya asrama'' occupied the first 20–25 years of life roughly corresponding to adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Manusmriti suggests the Brahmacharya ashrama be about 25 years, one fourth of the normal life of human being he estimates to be 100 years. See: RK Sharma (1999), Indian Society, Institutions and Change, {{ISBN|978-8171566655}}, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bodhinatha Veylanswami (2007), What Is Hinduism?, Editors of Hinduism Today, Himalayan Academy Publishers, {{ISBN|978-1934145005}}, page 372&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the child's ''[[Upanayanam]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Vivekjivandas, Sadhu.

(Swaminarayan Aksharpith: Ahmedabad, 2010) p. 113. {{ISBN|978-81-7526-434-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; the young person would begin a life of study in the [[Gurukula]] (the household of the [[Guru]]) dedicated to learning all aspects of ''dharma'' that is the "principles of righteous living". ''Dharma'' comprised personal responsibilities towards himself, family, society, humanity and God which included the environment, earth and nature. This educational period started when the child was five to eight years old and lasted until the age of 14 to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Rocher, Ludo. "The Dharmaśāstas". ''The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism''.(Ed.Gavin Flood) (Blackwell Publishing Ltd.: Oxford, 2003) p. 103. {{ISBN|0-631-21535-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this stage of life, the traditional [[Vedanga|vedic sciences]] and various sastras&lt;ref&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1958), Traditions of the Indian Craftsman, The Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 71, No. 281, Traditional India: Structure and Change (Jul. – Sep., 1958), pp. 224–230&lt;/ref&gt; were studied along with the religious texts contained within the [[Vedas]] and [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Parker (1987), Artistic practice and education in India: A historical overview, Journal of Aesthetic Education, pp 123–141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Misra, R.

Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad suggests that Brahmacharya (student) stage of life should extend from the age a child is ready to receive teachings from a ''guru'', and continue for a period of twelve years.&lt;ref&gt;KN Aiyar (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/thirtyminorupani00xxxxuoft#page/n151/mode/2up Narada Parivrajaka Upanishad], Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Archives, page 135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical references to Brahmacharya==
The Vedas discuss Brahmacharya, both in the context of lifestyle and stage of one's life. [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]], for example, in Book 10 Chapter 136, mentions knowledge seekers as those with ''Kesin'' (long haired) and soil-colored clothes (yellow, orange, saffron) engaged in the affairs of ''Mananat'' (mind, meditation).&lt;ref&gt;GS Ghurye (1952), Ascetic Origins, Sociological Bulletin, Vol. 1, No. 2, pages 162–184;&lt;br&gt;For original: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.१३६ Rigveda] Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; Rigveda, however, refers to these people as ''Muni'' and ''Vati''. The [[Atharva Veda]], completed by about 1000 BC, has more explicit discussion of ''Brahmacharya'', in Book XI Chapter 5.&lt;ref name=atharvaveda&gt;For source in Sanskrit: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/अथर्ववेदः/अथर्ववेद:_काण्डं_11 Atharva Veda] Wikisource, Hymns 11.5[7].1 – 11.5[7].26; ('''ब्रह्मचारी'''ष्णंश् चरति रोदसी उभे तस्मिन् देवाः संमनसो भवन्ति | स दाधार पृथिवीं दिवं च स आचार्यं तपसा पिपर्ति ||1|| '''ब्रह्मचारिणं''' पितरो देवजनाः पृथग् देवा अनुसंयन्ति सर्वे | गन्धर्वा एनम् अन्व् आयन् त्रयस्त्रिंशत् त्रिशताः षट्सहस्राः सर्वान्त् स देवांस् तपसा पिपर्ति ||2|| आचार्य उपनयमानो '''ब्रह्मचारिणं''' कृणुते गर्भम् अन्तः | तं रात्रीस् तिस्र उदरे बिभर्ति तं जातं द्रष्टुम् अभिसंयन्ति देवाः ||3|| (...))&lt;br&gt; For English translation: Stephen N Hay and William Theodore De Bary (1988), Sources of Indian Tradition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120804678}}, pages 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; This Chapter of Atharva Veda describes Brahmacharya as that which leads to one's second birth (mind, Self-awareness), with Hymn 11.5.3 painting a symbolic picture that when a teacher accepts a Brahmachari, the student becomes his embryo.&lt;ref name=atharvaveda/&gt;

The concept and practice of ''Brahmacarya'' is extensively found among the older strata of the [[Mukhya Upanishads]] in Hinduism. The 8th century BC text [[Chandogya Upanishad]] describes in Book 8, activities and lifestyle that is Brahmacharya:&lt;ref name=sscu&gt;Translation: S Swahananda (2010), Chandogya Upanishad, Vedanta Press, {{ISBN|978-8171203307}}, Book VIII, Chapter 5, verse 1–4&lt;br&gt;Original: अथ यद्यज्ञ इत्याचक्षते '''ब्रह्मचर्य'''मेव तद्ब्रह्मचर्येण | ह्येव यो ज्ञाता तं विन्दतेऽथ यदिष्टमित्याचक्षते | '''ब्रह्मचर्य'''मेव तद्ब्रह्मचर्येण ह्येवेष्ट्वात्मानमनुविन्दते ॥ १ ॥ अथ यत्सत्त्रायणमित्याचक्षते '''ब्रह्मचर्य'''मेव तद्ब्रह्मचर्येण | ह्येव सत आत्मनस्त्राणं विन्दतेऽथ यन्मौनमित्याचक्षते |

Jha (1942), The Chāndogyopaniṣad: A Treatise on Vedānta Philosophy, Oritental Book Agency, University of California Archives, {{oclc|7733219}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A hymn in another early Upanishad, the [[Mundaka Upanishad]] in Book 3, Chapter 1 similarly states,
{{quote|
सत्येन लभ्यस्तपसा ह्येष आत्मा सम्यग्ज्ञानेन ब्रह्मचर्येण नित्यम् ।

Through continuous pursuit of [[Satya]] (truthfulness), [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]] (perseverance, austerity), ''Samyajñāna'' (correct knowledge), and ''Brahmacharya'', one attains [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (the Self, soul).|Mundaka Upanishad|III.1.5&lt;ref&gt;MP Pandit (1969), Mundaka Upanishad 3.1.5, Gleanings from the Upanishads, {{oclc|81579}}, University of Virginia Archives, pages 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Vedas and early Upanishadic texts of Hinduism in their discussion of Brahmacharya, make no mention of the age of the student at the start of Brahmacharya,&lt;ref&gt;Some recent [[Upanishad]]s do, see for example Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad mentioned below&lt;/ref&gt; nor any restraint on sexual activity. One of the earliest discussion and contrasting viewpoints on sexual intercourse during ''Brahmacharya'' is in section 11.5.4 of [[Shatapatha Brahmana|Satpatha Brahamana]]. The verses 11.5.4.16 and 11.5.4.17 present two different viewpoints on sexual activity, one against and one as a choice.&lt;ref name=julius&gt;Julius Eggeling, [https://archive.org/stream/satapathabrhman01eggegoog#page/n143/mode/2up Satapatha Brahmana] Madhyandina School version, Clarendon Press, Oxford, page 90&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in verse 11.5.4.18, the Satapatha Brahamana presents contrasting viewpoints on an eating restraint for the Brahmachari.&lt;ref name=julius/&gt;

==Among religious movements==
In Indian traditions, a ''Brahmachari'' is a male and ''Brahmacharini'' a female.&lt;ref name=gdc&gt;[[George Chryssides]] (2006), The A to Z of New Religious Movements, {{ISBN|978-0810855885}}, page 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 79|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brahma Kumaris===
Among [[Brahma Kumaris]], ''Brahmacharya'' is practised by married couples and householders too, as a way of formalizing sexual behavior into a conscious, co-creative practice rather than merely an unconscious habit.&lt;ref name="Liz_Hodgkinson_Peace"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hodgkinson | first = Liz | title = Peace and Purity: The Story of the Brahma Kumaris a Spiritual Revolution | year = 2002 | publisher = HCI | isbn = 1-55874-962-4 | pages = 2–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Babb, Lawrence A.

The New Believers. Cassell &amp; Co. pp. 265. {{ISBN|0-304-35592-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Society for Krishna Consciousness===
In [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]], a [[bhakti yoga|bhakti]] sect or devotional movement within Hinduism, a male devotee is called ''brahmachari'' and female devotee ''brahmacharini.'' The unmarried male ''brahmacharis'' wear saffron robes, while married male householders wear white robes. ''Brahmacharinis'' wear [[sari]]s of any color. The terms ''brahmachari'' and ''brahmacharini'' are reserved for those practicing celibacy. Married devotees, in contrast, are called ''grihastha'' (householders).&lt;ref name=gdc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Chryssides (2011), Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements, Rowman Littlefield, {{ISBN|978-0810861947}}, page 304&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ashrams and Mathas===
Various ''Ashrams'' (आश्रम, hermitage) and ''Matha'' (मठ, college of ascetics) of various schools of Hinduism call their male and female initiates as Brahmachari and Brahmacharinis.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechilis (2004), The Graceful Guru: Hindu Female Gurus in India and the United States, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195145373}}, pages 74–101&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Curupira.png|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;An illustration of the ''Curupira'']]

The '''''Curupira''''' ({{IPA-pt|kuɾuˈpiɾɐ}}) is a mythological creature of [[Brazilian folklore]]. This creature blends many features of [[West Africa]]n and European fairies but was usually regarded as a demonic figure.

The name comes from the [[Tupi language]] ''kuru'pir'', meaning "covered in blisters". According to the cultural legends, this creature has [[Red hair|bright red/orange hair]], and resembles a man or a dwarf, but its feet are turned backwards. ''Curupira'' lives in the [[Wildlife of Brazil|forests of Brazil]] and uses its backward feet to create footprints that lead to its starting point, thus making hunters and travelers confused. Besides that, it can also create illusions and produce a sound that's like a high pitched whistle, in order to scare and drive its victim to madness. It is common to portray a ''Curupira'' riding a [[collared peccary]], much like another Brazilian creature called ''[[Caipora]]''.

A ''Curupira'' will prey on poachers and hunters that take more than they need of the forest, and he also attacks people who hunt animals that were taking care of their offspring. 
There are many different versions of the legend, and so the creature's appearance and habits may vary from each region in Brazil. However, ''Curupira'' is considered a nationwide folkloric figure.

A being called the Demon Curupira was featured in several episodes of the 1999 – 2002 television series ''[[BeastMaster (TV series)|BeastMaster]]''. Played by Australian actress [[Emilie de Ravin]], this Curupira, while still possessing the backwards feet, had the appearance of a young and deceptively sweet-faced blonde girl clad in green. She was a spirit of the forest and very capricious; she protected the animals, particularly tigers, and with a kiss she could drain humans of their lives, reducing their bodies to mere husks. She was an uneasy ally of the title character Dar, played by [[Daniel Goddard (actor)|Daniel Goddard]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2826">The '''''Demotic Chronicle''''' is an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[prophetic]] text.
The work is intended to provide a [[chronicle]] of the [[Twenty-eighth Dynasty of Egypt|28th]], [[Twenty-ninth dynasty of Egypt|29th]] and [[Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt|30th]] dynasties&lt;ref name=B551&gt;Bresciani, op. cit., p.&amp;nbsp;551&lt;/ref&gt; – thus the independence interval between the [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|two Persian dominations]]. Rather than providing historical events occurred during the reigns of the [[pharaoh]]s of the aforementioned period, the ''Demotic Chronicle'' judges these rulers on the basis of their behaviour, explaining the length and prosperity of their reigns as an expression of [[divine will]].&lt;ref name=B551/&gt; The ''Chronicle'' also emphasizes the misrule of the "Medes" (i.e. the [[Achaemenids]]) and of the [[Ptolemies]], and prophesies the coming of a native hero who will ascend to the throne and restore an era of [[Maat|order and justice]] upon Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/demotic-chronicle|title=DEMOTIC CHRONICLE – Encyclopaedia Iranica|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Toby Wilkinson]], ''The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt'', Bloomsbury, London, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;481&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript consists in a papyrus written in [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]]; hence, its name. It was found during the [[Napoleonic campaign in Egypt]] and now stored at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] (Pap. 215). The work claims to date back to the time of pharaoh [[Teos of Egypt|Teos]] of the 30th Dynasty, although in fact it's a later work datable to the 3rd century BCE, likely composed under the reign of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]].&lt;ref name=B551/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Despite its esoteric and cryptic text, analysis of the ''Demotic Chronicle'' have allowed, among other things, to integrate the order of succession of the treated pharaohs with the informations provided by [[Manetho]]'s epitomes.

In [[Sharia|Islamic law]] '''''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|dhabīḥah}}''''' (or '''zabiha''', {{lang-ar|ذَبِيْحَة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|dhabīḥah}}'' {{IPA-ar|ðæˈbiːħɐ|IPA}}, 'slaughter'&lt;sup&gt;(noun)&lt;/sup&gt;) is the prescribed method of [[ritual slaughter]] of all lawful [[halal]] animals. This method of slaughtering lawful animals has several conditions to be fulfilled. The name of [[God in Islam|God]] or "In the name of God" (''[[Basmala|Bismillah]]'') must be called by the butcher upon slaughter of each halal animal separately, and it should consist of a swift, deep incision with a very sharp knife on the throat, cutting the [[wind pipe]], [[jugular vein]]s and [[carotid artery|carotid arteries]] of both sides but leaving the [[spinal cord]] intact.&lt;ref&gt;[Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani, "The Islamic Laws of Animal Slaughter", White Thread Publishers, CA, USA]&lt;/ref&gt;

The method is used to comply with conditions stated in the [[Quran]] and in [[Sunnah|Islamic tradition]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Slaughtering process==
''Dhabīḥah'' is regulated by a set of rules intended to ensure the health of the animal to be slaughtered and conformance to Islamic religious law, which is derived from the [[Quran]] and [[hadith]]s.

===Relevant verses of the Quran===

{{Quote|"He has only forbidden you what dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that over which any other (name) than (that of) Allah has been invoked; but whoever is driven to necessity, not desiring, nor exceeding the limit, no sin shall be upon him; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."| Qurʼan, Surah 2 (al-Baqarah), [[ayah]] 173&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|173 |s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|"Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah; that which hath been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by being gored to death; that which hath been (partly) eaten by a wild animal; unless ye are able to slaughter it (in due form); that which is sacrificed on stone (altars); (forbidden) also is the division (of meat) by raffling with arrows: that is impiety. This day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: yet fear them not but fear Me.

===Prerequisites===
According to the laws of dhabīḥah ḥalāl, certain prerequisites must be met before an animal is slaughtered:
* The animal must not be a [[Haraam#Food and intoxicants|forbidden substance as per the Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;World faiths, Teach yourself - Islam by Ruqaiyyah Maqsood. {{ISBN|0-340-60901-X}}. Page 168&lt;/ref&gt;
* The slaughter itself must be done by a sane (mentally competent) adult Muslim, Jew, or Christian as they are considered "[[People of the Book]]" ({{lang-ar|Ahl al-Kitāb}}); this is a point of consensus amongst Muslim scholars. They differ, however, concerning whether [[Sabians]] and [[Zoroastrians]] are also included under [[People of the Book]] as stated in Surat al-Maʼidah, ayah 5. Modern authors{{who|date=December 2011}} have proposed that Christians who follow the Pauline doctrine of the Trinity are not included in this dispensation.
* Most Muslim scholars hold that mentioning God's name at the time of slaughter is a must; they differ as to whether or not forgetting to do so or leaving it off intentionally at the time of slaughter renders the sacrifice void and the meat thus forbidden for consumption. Some scholars like Ibn Rushd do not hold the opinion that mentioning God's name is obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islam.stackexchange.com/questions/37625/which-scholars-argue-that-mentioning-gods-name-while-slaughtering-is-not-obligat|title=Which scholars argue that mentioning Gods name while slaughtering is not obligatory?|author=|date=|website=islam.stackexchange.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also agree that if other than God's name is mentioned then this would be forbidden, due to the verse 5:3 "Forbidden for you are carrion, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that which has been slaughtered while proclaiming the name of any other than God, and one killed by strangling, and one killed with blunt weapons, and one which died by falling, and that which was gored by the horns of some animal, and one eaten by a wild beast, except those whom you slaughter; and that which is slaughtered at the altar and that which is distributed by the throwing of arrows [for an omen]; this is an act of sin." —– al-Maʼidah 5:3
"Eat not of that (meat) on which Allah's name has not been pronounced." [al-Anʻam 6:121]
Thus an [[animal slaughter]]ed by a Christian who did not mention anything at the time of slaughter would be permissible to some, while other scholars would hold it impermissible.
* In order for these traditions to take part in the United States, certain governmental regulations, enforced by acts, such as the [[Humane Slaughter Act]] require various prerequisites to be in place before any ritual or slaughter of any kind be permitted. This includes faiths such as Islam, for Halal processing, and Judaism, for Kosher processing. Regulations include that the animal be completely insensitive to pain before killing it, typically by a technique like [[electronarcosis]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Egyptian fatwa Committee, 18 December 1978, [http://www.organic-halal-meat.com/article/fatwa-stunning.php  "The Opinions of the Ulema on the Permissibility of Stunning Animals"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202233118/http://www.organic-halal-meat.com/article/fatwa-stunning.php |date=2 December 2012 }}, ''Organic Halal Meat''., 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic slaughtering===
{{one source|section|date=December 2010}}
[[File:ModernEgypt, Opening of Luxor-Aswan rail line, Album-2-BAL-00000606-0039.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A ritual slaughter in [[Esna]], [[Egypt]] in 1926.]]
The act of slaughtering itself is preceded by mentioning the name of God. Invoking the name of God at the moment of slaughtering is sometimes interpreted as acknowledgment of God's right over all things and thanking God for the sustenance he provides: it is a sign the food is taken not in sin or in gluttony, but to survive and praise Allah, as the most common blessing is, "Bismillah," or "In the name of God".

Thus the slaughter itself is preceded by the words "In the name of Allah (''[[Basmala|Bismillah]]'')". It is not regarded appropriate to use the phrase "[[Basmala|Bismillah al Raḥmān Al Raḥīm]]" (In the name of God the Beneficent the Merciful) in this situation, because slaughtering is an act of subdual rather than mercy.

According to Islamic tradition, the animal is brought to the place of slaughter and laid down gently so as to not injure it. It is [[Sunnah]] but not [[Fard]] that the head of the animal be facing the [[Qiblah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/118435|title=It is Sunnah to make the animal face the qiblah at the time of slaughter - islamqa.info|author=|date=|website=islamqa.info|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blade must be kept hidden until the very last moment while the jugular of the animal is felt. The conventional method used to slaughter the animal involves cutting the large arteries in the neck along with the [[esophagus]] and [[trachea]] with one swipe of a non-serrated blade. Care must be taken that the nervous system is not damaged, as this may cause the animal to die before [[exsanguination]] has taken place. During the swipe of the blade, the head must not be decapitated. While blood is draining, the animal is not handled until it has died. While this is an acceptable method, the Egyptian Fatwaa Committee has agreed that an animal can be rendered insensible to pain via [[electronarcosis]] and still be halal.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It's also important to note that these guidelines also respect the laws in place by the United States government to allow the practice to be permissible in the United States.

It is also compulsory that each animal must be slaughtered individually and in seclusion. In a [[Poultry farming|poultry farm]] or [[Slaughterhouse|slaughter house]], one animal must not witness another animal being slaughtered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2603360/Horror-halal-slaughterhouse-Shocking-undercover-film-shows-needless-suffering-livestock-butchered-without-stunned-first.html|title=Halal slaughterhouse horror: Film shows animals' 'needless suffering'|author=|date=|website=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This method adheres to Islamic law (it ensures the animal does not die by any of the [[Haraam]] methods) and helps to effectively drain blood from the animal. This may be important because the consumption of blood itself is forbidden in Islam;{{cite quran|2|173}} however, it is not clear that bleeding the animal removes all traces of blood from the carcass, so the meat may remain unclean. In fact it is stated by Islamic authorities that it is only necessary to drain "most" of the blood from the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.guidedways.com/articles/halalslaughtermethod.php#dhabh |title=An Assessment of the Muslim Method of Slaughter |date=18–19 September 1986 |author=Dr. Abdul Majid Katme |location=presented at the UFAW Symposium on Humane Slaughter and Euthanasia, held at the Zoological Society of London, Regent’s Park}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inducing unconsciousness===
Stunning the animal with a [[Captive bolt pistol|bolt-gun]], as is the standard practice in USDA FSIS inspected slaughtering houses, may cause instant death. Muslims regard meat from such a slaughter to be [[haraam]], considering such meat as [[carrion]].

It is for these reasons that there are ongoing questions and conversations within the North American Muslim community as to whether meat processed in these slaughter houses meets the standard of "halal" (as opposed to dhabīḥah). At center of this debate is the doubt as to whether this meat could qualify under the allowed category of the food of the People of the Book (Jewish and Christians). The first consideration being that standard slaughtering methods could cause the animal to die in a way other than slaughter (death through exsanguination).

Debate continues among [[Faqih|Muslim jurists]] and the general Muslim population about whether or not stunning, anesthetics, or other forms of inducing unconsciousness in the animal prior to slaughter are permissible as  per Islam. Several halal food authorities have more recently permitted the use of a recently developed [[fail-safe]] system of head-only stunning where the shock is less painful and non-fatal and where it is possible to reverse the procedure and revive the animal after the shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Masood Khawaja |title=Definition of Halal |publisher=Halal Food Authority |date=6 October 2001 |url=http://www.halalfoodauthority.co.uk/definitionhalal.html |accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stunning====
According to the British Halal Food Authority, [[stunning]] is permissible. However, there are different forms of stunning; some of which are prohibited, and some are permitted. According to the HFA, the following are prohibited:

* [[Stunning|Captive-bolt stunning]]
* [[Stunning|Percussion stunning]]
* [[Stunning|Gas stunning]]

There are two types of stunning that the Halal Food Authority approves:

* Water-bath Stun – for [[poultry]] only - where birds are dragged through water with an electric stunner within. Stated that sometimes they are not rendered fully paralyzed after the water bath because they lift their bodies up while struggling and do not make full contact with the stunner. Furthermore, the birds come out of the electrified bath paralyzed, but not stunned. Karen Davis of United Poultry Concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upc-online.org/slaughter/101608thedeath.html|title=Excerpt from Chapter Five, “The Death,” PRISONED CHICKENS, POISONED EGGS: AN INSIDE LOOK AT THE MODERN POULTRY INDUSTRY by Karen Davis, PhD. New Revised Edition, 2009.|author=|date=|website=www.upc-online.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Electric-Tong Stun – for larger animals, e.g. sheep, cow, camel, goat, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://halalfoodauthority.com/faq|title=Halal Food Certification, Halal Registration &amp; Accreditation - HFA|author=|date=|website=Halal Food Certification, Halal Registration &amp; Accreditation - HFA|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tong would have to stay attached to the head when the bovine falls. The neck to neck position must never be used because the current may fail to go through the brain. A headholder that holds the animal's head up when the body falls is strongly recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandin.com/humane/elec.stunning.cattle.html|title=Electric Stunning of Cattle|author=|date=|website=www.grandin.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Electronarcosis is also often used for larger animals, dulling the animal's senses before the slaughtering and has been agreed upon as licit by the Egyptian Fawtwa Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Jones, 6 March 2014, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/halal-shechita-politics-animal-slaughter "Halal, shechita and the politics of animal slaughter"], ''The Guardian,” 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egyptian Fatwa Committee, 18 December 1978, [http://www.organic-halal-meat.com/article/fatwa-stunning.php  "The Opinions of the Ulema on the Permissibility of Stunning Animals"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202233118/http://www.organic-halal-meat.com/article/fatwa-stunning.php |date=2 December 2012 }}, ''Organic Halal Meat.', 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies on animal welfare==
{{main|Bans on ritual slaughter}}

Opponents of dhabīḥah ḥalāl, most notably some animal welfare groups, contend that some methods of slaughter "cause severe suffering to animals" compared to when the animal is stunned before slaughter, which is  why the Egyptian Fatwaa Committee has agreed to the electronarcosis. In the United Kingdom, the government funded an independent advisory body [[Farm Animal Welfare Council]] but recommended that conventional dhabīḥah (along with [[Shechita|kosher slaughter (sheḥitah)]]) without prior stunning be abolished. The FAWC chairwoman of the time, Dr Judy MacArthur Clark, said, "This is a major incision into the animal and to say that it doesn't suffer is quite ridiculous." According to Dr Peter Jinman, president of the British Veterinary Association, vets are "looking at what is acceptable in the moral and ethical society we live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2977086.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Halal and Kosher slaughter 'must end' |date=10 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims counter this by referring to the problems connected with stunning and the alleged benefits of slaughter without stunning.&lt;ref name=asidcom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asidcom.org/IMG/pdf/ASIDCOM_report-Benefits_of_religious_slaughter-2.pdf|title=ASIDCOM report. Benefits of Religious Slaughter|author=|date=|website=asidcom.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that this method of slaughter without prior stunning leaves the [[spinal cord]], and thus the capacity to feel pain until death, intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Coghlan |first=Andy |title=Animals feel the pain of religious slaughter |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17972-animals-feel-the-pain-of-religious-slaughter.html |accessdate=28 February 2013 |newspaper=[[New Scientist]] |date=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK [[Farm Animal Welfare Council]] says that the method by which kosher and halal meat is produced causes severe suffering to animals and it should be banned immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/end-cruel-religious-slaughter-say-scientists-1712241.html |title=End 'cruel' religious slaughter, say scientists |work=The Independent |date=22 June 2009 |last=Hickman |first=Martin |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to FAWC it can take up to two minutes for cattle to bleed to death, thus amounting to animal abuse. [[Compassion in World Farming]] also supported the recommendation saying "We believe that the law must be changed to require all animals to be stunned before slaughter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/2977678.stm|title=Should Halal and Kosher meat be banned?|author=|date=16 June 2003|publisher=|accessdate=3 April 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2977086.stm|title=Halal and Kosher slaughter 'must end'|author=|date=10 June 2003|publisher=|accessdate=3 April 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The UK government rejected its recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rspca.org.uk/ImageLocator/LocateAsset?asset=document&amp;assetId=1232719611043&amp;mode=prd |title=Slaughter without pre-stunning (for religious purposes) |date=February 2015 |publisher=RSPCA |page=2 |format=PDF |access-date= 8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various research papers on cattle slaughter collected by [[Compassion In World Farming]] mention that "after the throat is cut, large clots can form at the severed ends of the carotid arteries, leading to occlusion of the wound (or "ballooning" as it is known in the slaughtering trade). Nick Cohen wrote in the ''New Statesman'', "Occlusions slow blood loss from the carotids and delay the decline in blood pressure that prevents the suffering brain from blacking out. In one group of calves, 62.5 per cent suffered from ballooning. Even if the cut to the neck is clean, blood is carried to the brain by vertebral arteries and it keeps cattle conscious of their pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Nick |title=God's own chosen meat |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/148337 |accessdate=28 February 2013 |newspaper=New Statesman |date=5 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Experiments carried out by the principal of the Swedish Veterinary Institute (''Veterinärhögskolan'') by order of the Swedish government in 1925 and published in 1928 determined that the blood carried to the brain by the vertebral arteries in bovines is reduced after slaughter by the Jewish method shehitah from 1/30 to 1/40, and on the basis of this and one other experiment Professor Axel Sahlstedt declared the method humane and not cruel. However, on the basis of other experiments that had showed different results, Sahlstedt recommended post-stunning as standard.&lt;ref&gt;"Some Attempts to Obtain, by Means of Physiological Experiments, an Objective Basis for an Opinion as to the Cruelty Alleged to Be Attendant on the Jewish Ritual Method of Slaughtering Cattle" by Professor A. V. Sahlstedt, Principal of the Veterinary Institute, Stockholm. (Abstract from 3 Nordiske, Veterinärmöte Oslo, 11 July 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a study between 1974 and 1978 [[Wilhelm Schulze]] and his colleagues carried out a study at the School of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover University in Germany: "Attempts to Objectify Pain and Consciousness in Conventional ([[captive bolt pistol]] stunning) and Ritual (knife) Methods of Slaughtering Sheep and Calves"&lt;ref&gt;Schulze W, Schultze-Petzold H, Hazem AS, Gross R.

However, recent studies have countered the Schulze study, which is dated and relied on older EEG measurement techniques. Dr. Schulze himself also warned in his report that the stunning technique may not have functioned properly.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Coghlan (13 October 2009).

Halal and kosher butchers deny that their method of killing animals is cruel and expressed anger over the FAWC recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2977086.stm Halal and Kosher slaughter 'must end'] BBC News. 10 June 2003. Retrieved 4 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Majid Katme of the [[Muslim Council of Britain]] also disagreed, stating that "it's a sudden and quick haemorrhage. A quick loss of blood pressure and the brain is instantaneously starved of blood and there is no time to start feeling any pain."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Karen Armstrong, ''Muhammad: Prophet for Our Time'', HarperPress, 2006, p.167 {{ISBN|0-00-723245-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, the [[DEFRA|Food and Farming minister]] in the UK, [[Lord Rooker]], stated that halal and kosher meat should be labeled when it is put on sale, so that members of the public can decide whether or not they want to buy food from animals that have been bled to death. He was quoted as saying, "I object to the method of slaughter ... my choice as a customer is that I would want to buy meat that has been looked after, and slaughtered in the most humane way possible." The [[RSPCA]] supported Lord Rooker's views.&lt;ref&gt;CIWF [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/halal-and-kosher-meat-should-not-be-slipped-in-to-food-chain-says-minister-805396.html Halal and kosher meat should not be slipped in to food chain, says minister]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] and the [[Humane Society International]], "the animals that are slaughtered according to kosher and halal should be securely restrained, particularly the head and neck, before cutting the throat" as "movements (during slaughter) results in a poor cut, bad bleeding, slow loss of consciousness, if at all, and pain."&lt;ref&gt;Guideline for Humane Handling, Transport and Slaughter of Livestock, Religious or ritual slaughter, ["?"http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/X6909E/x6909e00.HTM "?"].

In Europe, the [[DIALREL]] project addressed religious slaughter issues by gathering and disseminating information and by encouraging dialogue between the spiritual and scientific communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dialrel.eu/ DIALREL Website], Encouraging Dialogue on issues of Religious Slaughter&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for DIALREL was provided by The European Commission, and it began functioning in November 2006. DIALREL produced many fact sheets and ultimately published a final report in 2010, "Report on good and adverse practices - Animal welfare concerns in relation to slaughter practices from the viewpoint of veterinary sciences."

Certain Muslim and Jewish communities expressed frustration with the process of dialogue skewed for non-religious audiences.&lt;ref&gt;ASIDCOM (3 March 2010). [http://www.asidcom.org/Interview-with-Dr-Joe-M-Regenstein.html "Interview with Dr. Joe M. Regenstein : "A live worth living"".] ASIDCOM.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research undertaken in 2010 by [[Meat &amp; Livestock Australia]] on animal pain and distress concluded, "technologies available to alleviate such suffering overwhelmingly supports the use of pre-slaughter stunning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.livecorp.com.au/sites/default/files/rd_report/project_file/w.liv_.0383_review_of_stunning_and_halal_slaughter.pdf |title=Review of Stunning and Halal Slaughter |author=Pleiter, Helmut |ISBN=9781741915730 |date=February 2010 |work=[[Meat &amp; Livestock Australia]] |accessdate=4 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204013215/https://www.livecorp.com.au/sites/default/files/rd_report/project_file/w.liv_.0383_review_of_stunning_and_halal_slaughter.pdf |archivedate=4 February 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, in the United Kingdom, concern has been expressed regarding the slaughtering of animals without prior stunning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/what-is-halal-meat-and-why-is-it-controversial-10019645.html |title=What is halal meat and why is it controversial? |author=Troup Bachanan, Rose |date=3 February 2015 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/03/halal-slaughterhouse-staff-investigated-alleged-animal-cruelty-bowood-lamb-yorkshire |title=Halal slaughterhouse staff investigated over alleged animal cruelty |author=Malik, Shiv |date=3 February 2015 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritual slaughter in other religions==
Followers of some religions are prohibited from consuming meat slaughtered in the fashion described above.
The [[Rehat Maryada]] of [[Sikhism]] states that in Sikhism, "consumption of any meat killed in a ritualistic manner" is strictly [[Prohibitions in Sikhism|prohibited]], therefore prohibiting both halal and kosher meat.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Comparison of Islamic and Jewish dietary laws}}

There are many similarities between the rules concerning dhabihah and [[shechita]], Jewish ritual slaughter. The word ''dhabihah'' is linguistically similar to the Hebrew term זבח ''zevaḥ'' (sacrifice).

Muslims are divided as to whether or not Jewish slaughter suffices as a replacement for Islamic dhabihah halal. Some claim that Jewish slaughter leaves out the takbīr (saying "God is great") and changes the method of slaughter; thus, their meat is [[haraam]]. Others claim that the slaughtering processes are similar enough in practice and in theory to render animals slaughtered by Jewish laws as halal.

Jeremiah J Berman wrote in 1941:
"At the present day in most of the Islamic world Muslims purchase Jewish meat, though they will not buy Christian meat. This is true in Istanbul, Beirut, Jerusalem and Mogador. Contemporary Muslims in these cities consider Jewish slaughtering as fulfilling all the requirements of their law, while they regard the slaughtering performed by Christians as done in contravention thereof. In Yemen ... Jewish meat is not acceptable." Berman also reports that Jewish meat slaughtered in Salonica (Thessaloniki) was not acceptable to Muslims.&lt;ref name=shehitah&gt;Jeremiah J. Berman, ''Shehitah'' (1941)&lt;/ref&gt;

To be kosher, fit for consumption by those of the Jewish faith, meat must be slaughtered by a Jewish shohet who holds a licence from a rabbi and has been examined on the laws of shechitah. This alone means that halal meat is forbidden to those of the Jewish faith. The requirements for the shape of the knife are more severe, the knife must be free from a single nick and the method of cutting is exactly defined. In addition there is an inspection of the lungs (bedikah) that mammals must pass, which Muslims  do not have.&lt;ref name=shehitah/&gt;

[[File:Cortona Romulus and Remus Given Shelter by Faustulus 01.jpg|thumb|300px|Romulus and Remus being given shelter by Faustulus, oil by [[Pietro da Cortona]].]]

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Faustulus''' was the shepherd who found the infants [[Romulus and Remus]], who were being suckled by a [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]], known as Lupa, on the [[Palatine Hill]].  He, with his wife, [[Acca Larentia]], raised the children.&lt;ref&gt; Livy I.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Michael P. "The Folkloric Origins of Modern "animal-Parented Children" Stories." Journal of Folklore Research. 21.1 (1984): 63-85. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In some versions of the myth, Lupa was a prostitute (in Latin a ''lupa'', 'she-wolf'). The name Faustulus was later claimed by a Roman family, one of whom minted a coin showing Faustulus with the twins and she-wolf.  Sextus Pompeius Fostlus issued a silver denarius in about 140 BCE that showed, on the twins and she-wolf with Faustulus to their left.

'''''Hazūr Sāhib''''' (''{{lang|pa-Latn|hazūrī sāhib}}'' ''{{transl|ar|ḥaḍūr al-ṣāḥib}}'' "presence of the [[sahib|master]]"), also spelled ''Hazoor Sahib'', also known as ''Takht Sachkhand Sri Hazur Abchalnagar Sahib'' and ''Abchal Nagar'', is one of the five ''[[Takht (Sikhism)|takhts]]'' ("thrones", seats of temporal authority) in [[Sikhism]]. It is located on the banks of the [[River Godavari]] at the city of [[Nanded]] in the state of [[Maharashtra]], [[Western India]]. The [[gurudwara]] within the complex is known as '''Sach-Khand''' (Realm of Truth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.esakal.com/esakal/20110927/5185419872857734644.htm|location=[[Nanded]]|title=ऐतिहासिक दसरा पर्वाची गुरुद्वारात जय्यत तयारी|trans-title=Aitihāsika Dasarā Parvācī Gurudvārāta Jayyata Tayārī|language=Marathi|date=27 September 2011|access-date=23 May 2015|work=[[Sakal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure is built at the place where [[Guru Gobind Singh Ji ]] got shaheed. The inner room of the gurdwara is called the ''Angitha Sahib'' and is built over the place where Guru Gobind Singh was cremated in 1708. The gurdwara was built between 1832 and 1837 by order of [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh Ji ]] (1780–1839).

==History==
[[File:Aarti plate for a Sikh ceremony.jpg|thumb|Aarti prayers in Hazur Sahib Nanded.]]
Hazur Sahib marks the site where Guru Gobind Singh had his camp in 1708. The Guru held his court and congregation here and was convalescing after being attacked by two would-be assassins. One of the attackers stabbed the Guru, and was killed by him with a single stroke of his [[talwar]] (curved sword). The other was killed by his followers as he tried to escape. The Guru's wound was deep, but initially healed after being stitched by an English surgeon sent by Bahadur Shah I, who served as his doctor, and Dara Shikoh before him.&lt;ref&gt;http://satguru.weebly.com/european-surgeon-who-attended-satguru-gobind-singh-in-1708.html&lt;/ref&gt;  However the wound re-opened a few days later when the Guru was stringing a bow for one of his Sikhs and the Guru died after declaring the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] as his successor.&lt;ref name=GS&gt;{{cite book|title=Sikh shrines in India|last=G.S.|first=Randhir|year=1990|publisher=The Director of Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sikhs built a room over the platform where Guru Gobind Singh would sit while holding his court and installed the Guru Granth Sahib on it. They called it Takhat Sahib. Guru Gobind Singh, while conferring Guruship on the holy Book, had himself named Nanded as "Abchalnagar" (literally "Steadfast city") after the first word of a hymn read at random on the occasion.

In October 2008, the 300th anniversary celebration of the Guruship of Guru Granth Sahib took place here. This site is now one of five Takhats which are places of primary importance to the Sikhs. The other four takhats are: Akal Takhat at Amritsar, Takhat Keshgarh Sahib at Anandpur, Takhat Patna Sahib in Bihar and Takhat Damdama Sahib in Talwandi Sabo, Bhatinda, Punjab.

Sachkhand (literally "region of Truth") had been used by Guru Nanak to mean the abode of God. Ranjit Singh had the present building of the Takhat Sahib constructed with money, artisans and labor sent from the Punjab during the early 1830s. Around the same time the Nizam of Hyderabad State a Muslim ruler of the Deccan Region raised a contingent of Northern Sikhs as part of his army. Most of these men settled permanently in Hyderabad State and also devout Hindus of the Deccan embraced Sikhism in the 19th century. Hindus also have a high regard for the Guru Gobind Singh and gurudwara.

The control of Takhat Sachkhand Sri Hazoor Sahib, which had formerly passed into the hands of [[Udasi]] Sikh priests was regained by the Sikhs under the influence of the Singh Sabha Movement of the late nineteenth century. Some of the 'rituals and ceremonies connected with working' are peculiar to this Takhat Sahib. In 1956 an Act was passed by the legislature of Hyderabad under which the management of the Takhat Sahib and other historical Gurdwaras was legally placed under a 17-member Gurudwaras Board and a five-member Managing Committee.

The Takht houses both the sri Guru Granth Sahib ji and the [[Dasam Granth|Sri Dasam Granth]]. This follows the pattern of [[Takht Sri Patna Sahib]].

Nanded being the holy city where Baba Banda Singh Bahadur had his ashram and Baba Banda Singh started his journey of Khalsa victory from Nanded only, has a very high place in national history of India.

This shrine differs from other historical places of Sikh worship, here all ancient customs which were practised at the time of the Guru are still practised for example, sandal-wood tilak is still applied on the foreheads of priests and local devotees.

The most important aspect of this holy shrine is that there are two sanctum sanctorum here. While all the functions are carried out by the priests in the outer room, the inner room is a vault which houses priceless objects, weapons and other personal belongings of the Guru. No one except the head priest can enter this holy vault.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020427/windows/site.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hazur Sahib interior.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=Shri Hazoor Sahib Gurudwara Nanded|Interior view of the gurdwara]]
Recently, a laser-ray show has been started at Gobind Bagh near the main gurudwara. In this show the lives of the ten Gurus are briefly described. The show became very popular in a short period not only among Sikhs (local or visitors) but also people of other religions. It is the second largest laser show in Asia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3693">[[File:Palma il Giovane 001.jpg|thumb|250px|Christ healing the paralytic at Bethesda, by [[Palma il Giovane]], 1592.]]
The '''Healing of a paralytic at [[Pool of Bethesda|Bethesda]]''' is one of the miraculous healings [[miracles of Jesus in the Gospels|attributed to Jesus]] in the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Miracles of Jesus'' by Craig Blomberg, David Wenham 2003 {{ISBN|1592442854}} page 462&lt;/ref&gt;

This event occurs only in the [[Gospel of John]], which says that it took place near the ''Sheep Gate'' in [[Jerusalem]], close to a fountain or a [[Pool of Bethesda|pool]] called "Bethzatha" in the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]] version of the New Testament. The [[Revised Standard Version]] used the name "Bethzatha", but other versions (the [[King James Version]] and [[Geneva Bible]]) have "Bethesda". The place is called "Probatica, or in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] Bethsaida", in the [[Douai-Rheims Bible|Douai-Rheims translation]].

John's Gospel account describes how Jesus, visiting Jerusalem for a Jewish feast ({{bibleverse||John|5:1|NKJV}}), encounters one of the disabled people who used to lie here, a man who had been paralysed for thirty-eight years. Some [[Manuscripts of the Bible|manuscripts of the Gospel]] include a passage considered by many [[Textual criticism|textual critics]] to be an [[interpolation]] added to the original text, which explained that "an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up the water; then whoever stepped in first, after the stirring of the water, was made well of whatever disease he had" ({{bibleverse||John|5:4|NKJV}} - see [[John 5#Interpolation (verses 3b-4)|John 5]]). Jesus asks the man if he wants to get well. The man explains that he is unable to enter the water when the water is stirred up, because he has no one to help in and others go down ahead of him. Jesus tells him to pick up his bed or mat and walk; the man is instantly cured and is able to do so.

The Gospel then explains that this healing took place on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], and the local Jews told the cured man that the Law forbade him to carry his mat on this day. He tells them that he had been told to do so by the man who had healed him. They ask him who this healer was but he is unable to tell them because Jesus had slipped away into the crowd. 

Later, Jesus finds the man in the Temple, and tells him not to sin again, so that nothing worse happens to him. The man goes away and tells the Jewish people that it was Jesus who had made him well ({{bibleverse||John|5:15|NKJV}}. The Gospel account explains that the Jews began to persecute Jesus because he was healing on the Sabbath. He responds by saying that "My Father is still working, and I also am working" ({{bibleverse||John|5:17|NRSV}}. This assertion makes the Jews all the more determined to kill him, because not only is he breaking the Sabbath but he is making himself equal to God by calling God his father ({{bibleref2|John|5:1-18|NRSV|John 5:1-18}}).

==Comparison with [[Acts 3]]==
In {{bibleverse||Acts|3:1-10|NKJV}} a similar healing event is recorded, in which the Apostles [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] visit the Temple and heal a disabled person in Jesus' name. The setting is comparable, in each case a specific location in Jerusalem is named, and in each case the fact that the healed person walked away is highlighted.

After obtaining his BA, Jackman completed the one-year course "The Journey" at the Actors' Centre in Sydney.&lt;ref name="bravo"/&gt; About studying acting full-time, he stated, "It wasn't until I was 22 that I ever thought about my hobby being something I could make a living out of. As a boy, I'd always had an interest in theatre. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man. It wasn't what one did for a living. I got over that.

Jackman has said he "always loved acting but when I started at drama school I was like the dunce of the class. It just wasn't coming right to me. Everyone was cooler, everyone seemed more likely to succeed, everyone seemed more natural at it and in retrospect I think that is good. I think it is good to come from behind as an actor. I think it is good to go into an audition thinking 'Man I've got to be at my best to get this gig.'"&lt;ref name="shavemagazine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/interview-Hugh-Jackman/2 |title=Interview: Hugh Jackman |work=[[Shave (magazine)|Shave Magazine]] |first=Ziyah |last=Karmali |accessdate=8 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311185759/http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/interview-Hugh-Jackman/2 |archive-date=11 March 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1995–1999: Early career in theatre===
On the night of his final Academy graduation performance, Jackman received a phone call offering him a role on ''[[Correlli]]'': "I was technically unemployed for thirteen seconds." ''Correlli'', devised by Australian actress [[Denise Roberts]], was a 10-part drama series on ABC, Jackman's first major professional job, and where he met his future wife [[Deborra-Lee Furness]]. "Meeting my wife was the greatest thing to come out of it," he said,&lt;ref name="Biography Today 2010, p. 87"/&gt; as the show lasted only one season. After ''Correlli'' Jackman went on the stage in Melbourne. In 1996, Jackman played [[Gaston (Beauty and the Beast)|Gaston]] in the local Walt Disney production of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', and Joe Gillis in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.&lt;ref name="bravo"/&gt; During his stage musical career in Melbourne, he starred in the 1998 [[Midsumma]] festival cabaret production ''[[Summa Cabaret]]''. He also hosted Melbourne's [[Carols by Candlelight]] and Sydney's [[The Domain, Sydney|Carols in the Domain]]. Jackman's early film works include ''[[Erskineville Kings]]'' and ''[[Paperback Hero (1999 film)|Paperback Hero]]'' (1999), and his television work includes ''[[Law of the Land]]'', ''[[Halifax f.p.]]'', ''[[Blue Heelers]]'', and ''[[The Man from Snowy River (TV series)|Banjo Paterson's The Man from Snowy River]]''.

Jackman became known outside Australia in 1998, when he played the leading role of Curly in the [[Royal National Theatre]]'s acclaimed stage production of ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', in London's [[West End theatre|West End]].&lt;ref name="bravo"/&gt; The performance earned him an [[Olivier Award]] nomination for Best Actor in a Musical. Jackman said "I totally felt like it can't get any better than this. On some level that production will be one of the highlights of my career."&lt;ref&gt;Biography Today (2010), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; He also starred in the [[Oklahoma! (1999 film)|1999 film version of the same stage musical]], which has been screened in many countries.

===2000–2004: Breakthrough with ''X-Men''===
Jackman had his breakthrough role playing [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in [[Bryan Singer]]'s ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' (2000)—a superhero film based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[X-Men|team of the same name]].&lt;ref name="career"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sacks|first1=Ethan|title=Hugh Jackman: Wolverine will 'exist way longer than me'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/hugh-jackman-wolverine-exist-longer-article-1.1409140|accessdate=27 March 2017|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=26 July 2013|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328105204/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/hugh-jackman-wolverine-exist-longer-article-1.1409140|archive-date=28 March 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-starring [[Patrick Stewart]], [[James Marsden]], [[Famke Janssen]] and [[Ian McKellen]], the film tells the story of a group of [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], whose [[superpower (ability)|superhuman powers]] make them distrusted by normal humans.

Wolverine was tough for Jackman to portray because he had few lines, but a lot of emotion to convey in them. To prepare, he watched [[Clint Eastwood]] in the [[Dirty Harry (film series)|''Dirty Harry'' movies]] and [[Mel Gibson]] in ''[[Mad Max 2]]''. "Here were guys who had relatively little dialogue, like Wolverine had, but you knew and felt everything. I'm not normally one to copy, but I wanted to see how these guys achieved it."&lt;ref&gt;Biography Today (2010), pp. 90-91&lt;/ref&gt; Jackman was adamant about doing his own stunts for the movie. "We worked a lot on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial arts. I watched a lot of [[Mike Tyson]] fights, especially his early fights. There's something about his style, the animal rage, that seemed right for Wolverine. I kept saying to the writers, 'Don't give me long, choreographed fights for the sake of it. Don't make the fights pretty."&lt;ref&gt;Biography Today (2010), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Jackman also had to get used to wearing Wolverine's claws. "Every day in my living room, I'd just walk around with those claws, to get used to them. I've got scars on one leg, punctures straight through the cheek, on my forehead. I'm a bit clumsy. I'm lucky I didn't tell them that when I auditioned."&lt;ref name="Biography Today"/&gt;

Jackman was also required to add a great deal of muscle for the role, and in preparing for the fourth film in the series, he bench-pressed over 136&amp;nbsp;kg (300&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fleming |first=Michael |date=December 2008 |title=''Playboy'' Interview: Hugh Jackman |journal=Playboy |page= 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Jackman also starred in the action/drama ''[[Swordfish (film)|Swordfish]]'' with [[John Travolta]] and [[Halle Berry]].

In 2002, Jackman sang the role of Billy Bigelow in the musical ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' in a special concert performance at [[Carnegie Hall]] with the [[Orchestra of St. Luke's]].

Jackman was asked to consider taking on the role as [[James Bond]] before [[Daniel Craig]] was chosen to play the character, but turned it down due to other commitments. Speaking to the British Press Association in 2011, Jackman said: 'I was about to shoot X-Men 2 and Wolverine had become this thing in my life and I didn't want to be doing two such iconic characters at once.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3081618/Gwyneth-Paltrow-Titanic-Sarah-Michelle-Gellar-Clueless-John-Travolta-Forrest-Gump-blockbuster-movie-roles-actors-turned-revealed.html/|title=The blockbuster movie roles actors turned down|date=May 19, 2015|work=[[Daily Mail]]|access-date=27 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224040133/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3081618/Gwyneth-Paltrow-Titanic-Sarah-Michelle-Gellar-Clueless-John-Travolta-Forrest-Gump-blockbuster-movie-roles-actors-turned-revealed.html|archive-date=24 December 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3220510/Hugh-Jackman-keen-James-Bond-role-admitting-turned-originally-offered-X-Men.html/|title=Hugh Jackman reveals he's already turned James Bond role down once before|date=September 3, 2015|work=[[Daily Mail]]|access-date=27 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131031009/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3220510/Hugh-Jackman-keen-James-Bond-role-admitting-turned-originally-offered-X-Men.html|archive-date=31 January 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3272524/Roger-Moore-says-Hugh-Jackman-Damian-Lewis-play-Bond.html|title=Roger Moore says Hugh Jackman should play the next James Bond|date=October 15, 2015|work=[[Daily Mail]]|access-date=1 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017042137/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3272524/Roger-Moore-says-Hugh-Jackman-Damian-Lewis-play-Bond.html|archive-date=17 October 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside [[Christian Bale]], [[Michael Caine]], and [[Scarlett Johansson]], Jackman starred in ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' (2006), a mystery thriller from [[Christopher Nolan]]. Jackman portrayed Robert Angier, an [[aristocratic]] magician who builds up a rivalry with contemporary Alfred Borden (Bale) in attempt to one-up each other in the art of deception.

Jackman portrayed three different characters in [[Darren Aronofsky]]'s science-fiction film ''[[The Fountain (film)|The Fountain]]'': Tommy Creo, a [[neuroscientist]], who is torn between his wife, Izzi ([[Rachel Weisz]]), who is dying of a [[brain tumor]], and his work at trying to cure her; Captain Tomas Creo, a Spanish [[conquistador]] in 1532 [[Seville]]; and a future astronaut, Tom, travelling to a golden nebula in an eco-spacecraft seeking to be reunited with Izzi. Jackman said ''The Fountain'' was his most difficult film thus far due to the physical and emotional demands of the part.

Jackman also starred in [[Woody Allen]]'s 2006 film ''[[Scoop (2006 film)|Scoop]]'' opposite [[Scarlett Johansson]]. That year he also reprised the role of Wolverine in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. He rounded out 2006 with two animated films: ''[[Happy Feet]]'', directed by [[George Miller (producer)|George Miller]], in which he voiced the part of Memphis, an [[emperor penguin]]; and ''[[Flushed Away]]'', where Jackman supplied the voice of a rat named Roddy who ends up being flushed down a family's toilet into the London sewer system. ''Flushed Away'' co-starred [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Ian McKellen]] (Jackman's fourth time working with him).

In 2007, Jackman produced and guest-starred in the television [[Musical film|musical]]-[[comedy-drama|dramedy]] series ''[[Viva Laughlin]]'', which was cancelled by [[CBS]] after two episodes.

[[File:HughJackmanByPaulCush2011.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hugh Jackman at the Sydney premiere for ''[[Real Steel]]'' in September 2011]]
In 2008, director [[Baz Luhrmann]] cast Jackman to replace [[Russell Crowe]] as the male lead in his much-publicized [[epic film]], ''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]'', which co-starred [[Nicole Kidman]].

Of the movie, Jackman said, "This is pretty much one of those roles that had me pinching myself all the way through the shoot. I got to shoot a big-budget, shamelessly old-fashioned romantic epic set against one of the most turbulent times in my native country's history, while, at the same time, celebrating that country's natural beauty, its people, its cultures....

'''[[Islam]]''' is the [[Religion in Croatia|second-largest faith]] in [[Croatia]] after [[Christianity]]. The religion is followed by 1.47% of the country's population according to the 2011 census, compared to 91.06% Christians and 4.57%  not religious, atheists, agnostics and sceptics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/censuses/census2011/results/htm/H01_01_12/H01_01_12.html |title=Državni zavod za statistiku Republike Hrvatske |publisher=Dzs.hr |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam was first introduced to Croatia by the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War|Croatian–Ottoman Wars]] that lasted from 15th to 16th century. During this period some parts of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatian Kingdom]] were occupied which resulted in numerous [[Croats]] converting to [[Islam]], some after being taken [[prisoners of war]], some through the [[devşirme]] system. Nonetheless, Croats strongly fought against the Turks during these few centuries which resulted in the fact that the westernmost border of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Europe]] became entrenched on the Croatian soil. In 1519, Croatia was called the ''[[Antemurale Christianitatis]]'' by [[Pope Leo X]].

The [[Islamic Community of Croatia]] (''Mešihat Islamske Zajednice u Hrvatskoj'') is the main organization of Muslims in Croatia that is officially recognized by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2003_12_196_3110.html | language = Croatian | publisher = [[Narodne novine]] | work = Narodne novine - Službeni list Republike Hrvatske NN196/03 | title =Ugovor između Vlade Republike Hrvatske i Islamske zajednice u Hrvatskoj o pitanjima od zajedničkog interesa | date = December 15, 2003 | accessdate = February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President of the Islamic Community is Aziz [[Effendi]] Hasanović.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balkans.aljazeera.net/vijesti/islam-u-hrvatskoj-model-za-cijelu-evropu |title=Islam u Hrvatskoj - model za cijelu Evropu &amp;#124; Al Jazeera Balkans |language=bs |publisher=Balkans.aljazeera.net |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, 62,977 Muslims live in Croatia.  Most of them  declare themselves as [[Bosniaks]] (45,225) while others declare themselves as: [[Albanians]] (9,594), [[Romani people|Roma]] (5,039), [[Turkish people|Turks]] (343), [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] (217), [[Montenegrins]] (159) and other (2,420).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

== History ==
=== Ottoman times ===

The [[Croatian–Ottoman Wars|Turkish Ottoman Empire conquered part of Croatia from the 15th to the 19th century]]. Numerous [[Croats]] converted to [[Islam]], some after being taken [[prisoners of war]], some through the [[devşirme]] system. The westernmost border of Ottoman Empire in [[Europe]] became entrenched on Croatian soil. In 1519, Croatia was called the ''[[Antemurale Christianitatis]]'' by [[Pope Leo X]].

The historical names of many officials in the Ottoman Empire reveal their origin (Hirwat = Hrvat or Horvat, which is a Croatian name for Croat): [[Rüstem Pasha]] (Rustem Pasha Hrvat - Opuković), [[Piyale Pasha]] (Pijali Pasha Hrvat), Memipaša Hrvat, Tahvilpaša Kulenović Hrvat etc.
There was some considerable confusion over the terms "Croat" and "Serb" in these times, and "Croat" in some of these cases could mean anyone from the wider South Slavic area.&lt;ref name="Théoharis Stavrides"&gt;{{cite book | last=Stavrides | first=Théoharis | title=The Sultan of vezirs: the life and times of the Ottoman Grand Vezir Mahmud Pasha Angelovic (1453–1474) | publisher=Brill | location= | year=2001 | isbn = 978-90-04-12106-5 | pages = 73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1553, [[Antun Vrančić]], Roman cardinal, and Franjo Zay, a diplomat, visited Istanbul as envoys of the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Croatian-Hungarian king]] to discuss a peace treaty with the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the initial ceremonial greetings they had with [[Rüstem Pasha]] Hrvat (a Croat) the conversation led in Turkish with an official interpreter was suddenly interrupted. Rustem Pasha Hrvat asked in Croatian if Zay and Vrančić spoke [[Croatian language]]. The interpreter was then dismissed and they proceeded in the Croatian language during the entire process of negotiations.

In 1585, traveler and writer [[Marco A. Pigaffetta]], in his ''Itinerario'' published in [[London]], states: ''In [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] it is customary to speak [[Croatian language|Croatian]], a language which is understood by almost all official Turks, especially military men.'' Crucially though, the ''lingua franca'' at the time among Slavic elites in the Ottoman Empire was still [[Old Church Slavonic]].  For Italians traveling through to Istanbul, the language of the Slavic Croats was often the only exposure they had to any of the Slavic languages; indeed, Bulgarian and Macedonian dialects were far more common in Istanbul than Croatian.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

[[File:Zagrebačka džamija.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Zagreb Mosque]] was completed in 1987.]]

Within the territory of the present Republic of Croatia, Muslim believers were registered for the first time during the 1931 census: 1,239 of them were in Zagreb and their overall number in Croatia being only about 4000.

During the [[Second World War]] the mufti of Zagreb was [[Ismet Muftić]]. After the war he was tried and eventually publicly hanged by the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] in 1945 because of his collaboration with the fascist regime of the Croatian [[World War II in Yugoslavia|WWII]] dictator [[Ante Pavelić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/24040 |title=Religious communities in Croatia from 1945 to 1991 |publisher=Hrcak.srce.hr |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bib.irb.hr/prikazi-rad?rad=44475 |title=Croatian scientific bibliography - Browsing paper |publisher=Bib.irb.hr |date=2010-05-14 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hdlu.hr/mestrovicev-paviljon/povijest-zgrade/ |title=Povijest zgrade &amp;#124; HDLU – Hrvatsko društvo likovnih umjetnika |publisher=Hdlu.hr |date=2015-01-09 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next censa in the [[People's Republic of Croatia]], registered Muslim believers numbered as follows:
* 1,077 persons in 1948
* 16,185 persons in 1953
* 3,113 persons in 1961
* 18,487 persons in 1971
* 23,740 persons in 1981
* 43,486 persons in 1991

In the 1960s, the Bosnians Muslims community advocated for the recognition of the [[Bosniaks]] as a nationality in [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. The [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]] allowed for the official recognition of the Muslims as a nationality, therefore allowing more individuals to declare their alignment with a compromise categorization of [[Muslims by nationality]] (''Muslimani''), in this case separated from a religious basis (''muslimani'' without capital letter). For example, [[Džemal Bijedić]], a communist federal prime-minister was a declared "Muslim" and an atheist. The spike in the number of self-declared "Muslims" during socialist Yugoslavia times should thus be understood as persons having a family Muslim cultural background (similar to the concept of [[cultural Christian]]s), rather than practicing believers in Islam.
Based on the figures recorded during the 1931 to 1961 census, it may also be concluded that a certain number of Muslim believers declared themselves as [[Croats]] or [[Yugoslavs]].

After the [[dissolution of Yugoslavia]], an additional increase can be attributed to the influx of Bosnian Muslims that took place during and after the [[Bosnian War|1992-1996 Bosnian conflict]].

The [[2001 Croatian census]] identified a total of 56,777 adherents of Islam, or 1.3% of the total population of Croatia.&lt;ref name="census2001-r"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/censuses/Census2001/Popis/H01_02_04/H01_02_04.html |title=SAS Output |publisher=Dzs.hr |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following ethnic groups were presumed to be significantly Muslim:

* 19,677 continued to use the Yugoslav term [[Muslims by nationality|''Muslims'' as a nationality]]&lt;ref name="census2011-n-d"/&gt; (who are also Slavic Muslims)
* Turks: 300 (0.01%)&lt;ref name="census2011-n-d"/&gt;
* A remainder of 16,345 individuals&lt;ref name="census2001-r"/&gt; who declared themselves some other nationality, possibly [[Croats]], [[Albanians of Croatia|Albanians]] (15,082 or 0.34%)&lt;ref name="census2011-e-g"/&gt;&lt;ref name="census2011-n-d"/&gt; and [[Roma of Croatia|Roma]] (9,463 or 0.21%).&lt;ref name="census2011-e-g"/&gt;&lt;ref name="census2011-n-d"/&gt;

==Islam today==
Croatia's capital [[Zagreb]] has one of the biggest [[mosques]] in [[Europe]] since 1987. During the  existence of the [[Ottoman Empire]] it had none because [[Zagreb]], as well as most parts of Croatia, was not occupied by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] during the [[Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War]].

The [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] imam [[Šefko Omerbašić|Ševko Omerbašić]], was the long-time leader of the [[Muslim]] community of [[Croatia]] and the [[Mufti]] of [[Zagreb]].

A new mosque in [[Rijeka]] was opened in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://daily.tportal.hr/259528/Islamic-Centre-in-Rijeka-inaugurated.html | title=Islamic Centre in Rijeka inaugurated | work=tportal.hr | date=4 May 2013 | accessdate=11 May 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130702053555/http://daily.tportal.hr/259528/Islamic-Centre-in-Rijeka-inaugurated.html | archivedate=2 July 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim community is also planning to build a mosque in [[Osijek]] and [[Sisak]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}  A mosque in [[Karlovac]] is also being considered.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The '''Islamic Party of Britain''' is a defunct [[political party]] in the United Kingdom that was active from its formation in 1989&lt;ref name=wings&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TbYTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=K5ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6294,61245|title=British Islamic Party spreads its wings|last=Dabrowska|first=Karen|date=16 November 1989|work=New Straits Times|accessdate=10 February 2010|location=Malaysia}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2006. The IPB was opposed to both [[capitalism]] and [[communism]]. David Musa Pidcock, a [[Sheffield]] man who [[Religious conversion|converted]] from [[Roman Catholicism]] to [[Islam]] while working as an engineer in [[Saudi Arabia]], founded and led the party.&lt;ref name=wings/&gt; The IPB published a quarterly magazine entitled ''Common Sense''.

The party entered the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]], standing three unsuccessful candidates in the constituencies of [[Bradford]], a city with a large Muslim minority, and one in London constituency Streatham.

==Performance==
The Islamic Party never achieved a seat in either house of Parliament. Pidcock represented the party in the [[Bradford North by-election, 1990]], earning 800 votes (2.2%), finishing fourth of ten candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://by-elections.co.uk/bradford90.html|title=By Election Betting – A Political Betting Blog|author=|date=|work=by-elections.co.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821055155/http://www.by-elections.co.uk/bradford90.html|archivedate=21 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 General Election]], the party stood candidates in each of the three constituencies in the [[City of Bradford]]. All of them finished last, with Pidcock in [[Bradford West]] doing the best, with 471 votes (0.96%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/ge92/i03.htm|title=UK General Election results: April 1992 [Archive]|author=|date=|work=politicsresources.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also stood a candidate in [[Streatham (UK Parliament constituency)|Streatham]], coming fifth of seven.&lt;ref name=electoralcalculus1992&gt;{{cite web|title=Election Data 1992|url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_1992ob.txt|publisher=[[Electoral Calculus]]|accessdate=18 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015054418/http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_1992ob.txt|archivedate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with other parties==
In its first year, Pidcock claimed that his party was planning co-operation with the ecologist [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]].&lt;ref name=wings/&gt;

Members of the party have supported the [[Respect Party]]; one of their leading members, home affairs spokesman [[Mohammad Naseem]], stood for and funded the party.&lt;ref name=gay&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/nov/25/uk.gayrights|title=Gay group tells Galloway to cut ties with donor|last=Muir|first=Hugh|date=25 November 2005|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies==
The party believed in equal treatment under the law regardless of an individual's status, income or ethnicity. The IPB argued that religion is the most important thing in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mustaqim.co.uk/ipb-archive/policies/thepolicies.htm|title=The Policies: Main Page|author=|date=|work=mustaqim.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It called for reform of the British banking system to make it interest-free and [[Islamic banking and finance|Islamic]], and for increased trade with the Islamic world.&lt;ref name=wings/&gt; At one time, the party answered questions sent in by readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mustaqim.co.uk/ipb-archive/question/answers.htm|title=Retrieve An Answer|author=|date=|work=mustaqim.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; When answering one question, the party argued that homosexuality needed treatment, was not to be tolerated and that homosexuals should be put to death for a "public display of lewdness",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mustaqim.co.uk/ipb-archive/question/ans41.htm|title=Question Forum: Islamic View on Homosexuality|author=|date=|work=mustaqim.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; a policy that was condemned by [[Peter Tatchell]].&lt;ref name=gay/&gt;

The '''Jerusalem Islamic Waqf''' is an [[Waqf|Islamic religious trust]] (sometimes called an "Islamic Religious Endowments" organization) best known for controlling and managing the current Islamic edifices on and around the [[Temple Mount]] in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]], including the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] and the [[Dome of the Rock]].&lt;ref name="AM20140905"&gt;{{cite news|title=Arab states neglect Al-Aqsa says head of Jerusalem Waqf|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/09/khatib-muslim-endowments-israel-jordan-al-aqsa.html|accessdate=5 April 2016|work=[[Al-Monitor]]|date=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some form or another of the waqf has governed access to the Haram esh-Sharif since the [[Saladin#Capture of Jerusalem|Muslim reconquest]] of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] in 1187, with the latest version instituted by the [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] after its conquest of the West Bank and East Jerusalem during the 1948 war.&lt;ref name="books.google.be"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sachar|first1=Howard M.|title=A History of Israel: From the Rise of Zionism to Our Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0X4BAAAAQBAJ|edition=2|date=2013|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8041-5049-1|accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the King of Jordan currently supplies all of the funding needed to operate the waqf, which is in effect the civil administration for the holy site.&lt;ref name="AM20140905" /&gt;

[[Israel]] occupied the Old City of Jerusalem during the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967. After the end of hostilities, Israel allowed the waqf to retain authority over the [[Temple Mount]] (Haram esh-Sharif).&lt;ref name="MFA20141117"&gt;{{cite web|title=Behind the Headlines: Jerusalem's Temple Mount|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Issues/Pages/Jerusalem-Temple-Mount-12-Nov-2014.aspx|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]|accessdate=5 April 2016|date=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The waqf administration is headed by a director (or sometimes "director-general") who runs the civil administration for the holy sites.&lt;ref name="AM20140905" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reiter|first1=Yitzhak|title=Islamic Endowments in Jerusalem Under British Mandate|date=1996|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=0714643424|pages=272|edition=First|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJOaAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]] is in charge of Islamic religious affairs at the site. The [[Supreme Muslim Council]] is the Islamic judicial body governing affairs under Islamic law within Israel. The [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] has parallel organizations claiming interest in these same matters (i.e., the Ministry of Islamic Waqf at the Palestinian Authority,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ministry of Islamic Waqf at the Palestinian Authority|url=http://www.crihl.org/content/ministry-islamic-waqf-palestinian-authority|website=The Council of the Religious Institutions of the Holy Land|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Palestinian Authority Grand Mufti, or the Palestinian Supreme Fatwa Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PA Mufti and Islamic council: Israel plans to Judaize Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa Mosque|url=http://www.palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=606&amp;doc_id=15372|website=[[Palestinian Media Watch]]|publisher=[[Al-Hayat al-Jadida]]|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and those are not to be confused with those recognized by Israel, even if some of the same people hold both offices.

The '''Lepcha''' are also called the '''Rongkup''' meaning the children of God and the Rong, Mútuncí Róngkup Rumkup ([[Lepcha language|Lepcha]]: &lt;span style="font-family:'Mingzat', 'Mainwaring Rong', 'XenoType Lepcha', 'Noto Sans Lepcha';"&gt;ᰕᰫ་ᰊᰪᰰ་ᰆᰧᰶ ᰛᰩᰵ་ᰀᰪᰱ ᰛᰪᰮ་ᰀᰪᰱ&lt;/span&gt;; "beloved children of the Róng and of God"), and Rongpa ([[Sikkimese language|Sikkimese]]: {{bo-textonly|རོང་པ་}}), are among the indigenous peoples of [[Sikkim]], [[India]] and number between 30,000 and 50,000. Many Lepcha are also found in western and southwestern [[Bhutan]], [[Tibet]], [[Darjeeling]], the [[Mechi Zone]] of eastern [[Nepal]], and in the hills of [[West Bengal]]. The Lepcha people are composed of four main distinct communities: the Renjóngmú of [[Sikkim]]; the Dámsángmú of [[Kalimpong]], [[Kurseong]], and [[Mirik]]; the ʔilámmú of [[Ilam District]], Nepal; and the Promú of [[Samtse District|Samtse]] and [[Chukha District|Chukha]] in southwestern [[Bhutan]].{{sfn|Plaisier|2007|p=1–2}}{{sfn|SIL 2009}}{{sfn|NIC-Sikkim}}

== Origins ==
[[File:A group of Lepcha shingle cutters at Darjeeling in the 1870s.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A group of Lepcha shingle cutters at Darjeeling in the 1870s]]
[[File:A group of Lepchas in Darjeeling (c. 1880).jpg|thumb|200px|right|A group of Lepchas in Darjeeling (c. 1880)]]
The word Lepcha (endonym Roang kup) is considered to be the anglicized version of the [[Nepali language|Nepalese]] word '''lepche''' meaning "vile speakers" or "inarticulate speech". This was at first a derogatory nickname but is no longer seen as negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=Barbara A.|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania|year=2009|publisher=Facts on File|isbn=978-0816071098|page=462|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pCiNqFj3MQsC&amp;pg=PA462&amp;dq=origin+of+the+Lepcha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RUoGUt2vObTU4QSWgYHYBw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=origin%20of%20the%20Lepcha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the Lepcha is Nye Mayel Lyang  . They may have originated in [[Myanmar]], [[Tibet]] or [[Mongolia]] but the Lepcha people themselves firmly believe that they did not migrate to the current location from anywhere and are indigenous to the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=Barbara A.|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania|year=2009|publisher=Facts on File|isbn=978-0816071098|page=462|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pCiNqFj3MQsC&amp;pg=PA462&amp;dq=origin+of+the+Lepcha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RUoGUt2vObTU4QSWgYHYBw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=origin%20of%20the%20Lepcha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They speak a [[Tibeto-Burman language]] which some classify as [[Himalayish]]. Based on this, some anthropologists suggest they emigrated directly from [[Tibet]] to the north, Japan or from Eastern [[Mongolia]]. Others suggest a more complex migration that started in southeast Tibet, a migration to [[Thailand]], Burma, or [[Japan]], then a navigation of the [[Ayeyarwady River]] and [[Chindwin]] rivers, a crossing of the [[Patkoi]] range coming back west, and finally entering ancient [[India]]. While migrating westward through India, they are surmised to have passed through southern Bhutan before reaching their final destination near [[Kanchenjunga]]. The Lepcha people themselves do not have any tradition of migration, and hence they conclude that they are aboriginal to the region, currently falling under the state of [[Sikkim]], [[Darjeeling District]] of [[West Bengal]], [[Eastern Development Region, Nepal|eastern]] [[Nepal]] and the southwestern parts of Bhutan. In the [[Mechi Zone]], they form 7% of the population of [[Ilam District]], 2% in [[Panchthar District]], and 10% of the population in [[Taplejung District]]. In [[Sikkim]] as a whole they are considered to be around 15% of the population of the state.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

== Language ==
{{main|Lepcha language}}

The Lepcha have their own [[Lepcha language|language]], also called Lepcha. It belongs to the [[Bodish–Himalayish languages|Bodish–Himalayish]] group of [[Tibeto-Burman languages]]. The Lepcha write their language in their own script, called ''Róng'' or [[Lepcha script]], which is derived from the [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] script. It was developed between the 17th and 18th centuries, possibly by a Lepcha scholar named [[Thikúng Mensalóng]], during the reign of the third [[Chogyal]] (Tibetan king) of [[Sikkim]].{{sfn|Plaisier|2007|p=34}} The world's largest collection of old Lepcha manuscripts is found with the [[Himalayan Languages Project]] in [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]], with over 180 Lepcha books.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

== Clans ==
Lepchas are divided into many clans ([[Lepcha language|Lepcha]]: ''putsho''), each of which reveres its own sacred lake and mountain peak ([[Lepcha language|Lepcha]]: ''dâ'' and ''cú'') from which the clan derives its name. While most Lepcha can identify their own clan, Lepcha clan names can be quite formidable, and are often shortened for this reason. For example, ''Simíkmú'' and ''Fonyung Rumsóngmú'' may be shortened to ''Simik'' and ''Foning'', respectively.{{sfn|Plaisier|2007|p=3}} Some of the name of the clans are "Sada", "Barphungputso", "Rongong", "Karthakmu", "Sungutmu", "Phipon", "Brimu", etc.

== Religion ==
{{main|Mun (religion)}}

Most Lepchas are [[Buddhist]], a religion brought by the [[Bhutia]]s from the north, although a large number of Lepchas have today adopted [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Joshi|2004|p=157}}{{sfn|Semple|2003|p=123}} Some Lepchas have not given up their [[shamanism|shamanistic]] religion, which is known as [[Mun (religion)|Mun]]. In practice, rituals from Mun and Buddhism are frequently observed alongside one another among some Lepchas. For example, ancestral mountain peaks are regularly honored in ceremonies called ''cú rumfát.''{{sfn|Plaisier|2007|p=3}} Many [[rituals]] involve local species. In Sikkim, Lepchas are known to use over 370 species of animals, fungi, and plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Neill |first1=Alexander |display-authors=etal |date=2017-03-29 |title=Integrating ethnobiological knowledge into biodiversity conservation in the Eastern Himalayas |url=https://ethnobiomed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13002-017-0148-9 |dead-url= |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine |volume=13 |issue=21 |pages= |doi=10.1186/s13002-017-0148-9 |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=2017-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Nepal Census of 2001, out of the 3,660 Lepcha in Nepal, 88.80% were Buddhists and 7.62% were Hindus.

== Clothing ==
[[File:Lepcha circa 1900.png|thumb|right|250px|Photograph of a Lepcha c. 1900, wearing the traditional cone-shaped hat]]
The traditional clothing for Lepcha women is the ankle-length ''[[dumdyam|dumbun]]'', also called ''dumdyám or gādā'' ("female dress"). It is one large piece of smooth cotton or silk, usually of a solid color. When it is worn, it is folded over one shoulder, pinned at the other shoulder, and held in place by a waistband, or ''tago'', over which excess material drapes. A contrasting long-sleeved blouse may be worn underneath.{{sfn|Plaisier|2007|p=4}}{{sfn|Dubey|1980|p=53, 56}}

The traditional Lepcha clothing for men is the ''[[dumpra|dumprá]]'' ("male dress"). It is a multicolored, hand-woven cloth pinned at one shoulder and held in place by a waistband, usually worn over a white shirt and trousers. Men wear a flat round cap called a ''thyáktuk'', with stiff black velvet sides and a multicolored top topped by a knot. Rarely, the traditional cone-shaped [[bamboo]] and [[rattan]] hats are worn.{{sfn|Plaisier|2007|p=4}}{{sfn|Dubey|1980|p=53, 56}}

== Marriage customs ==
The Lepcha trace their descent [[patrilineal]]ly. The marriage is negotiated between the families of the bride and the groom. If the marriage deal is settled, the [[lama]] will check the horoscopes of the boy and girl to schedule a favourable date for the wedding. Then the boy's maternal uncle, along with other relatives, approach the girl's maternal uncle with a ''khada'', a ceremonial scarf, and one rupee, to gain the maternal uncle's formal consent.{{sfn|Gulati|1995|pp=80–81}}

The wedding takes place at noon on the auspicious day. The groom and his entire family leave for the girl's house with some money and other gifts that are handed over to the bride's maternal uncle. Upon reaching the destination, the traditional [[Nyomchok ceremony]] takes place, and the bride's father arranges a feast for relatives and friends. This seals the wedding between the couple.{{sfn|Gulati|1995|pp=80–81}}

{{Jews by country}}

From the [[Middle Ages]] until the [[World War II]] [[Holocaust]], [[Polish Jews|Jews]] comprised an appreciable part of the general [[Poland|Polish]] population.  The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], known as a "[[Heaven for the nobles, Purgatory for the townspeople, Hell for the peasants, and Paradise for the Jews|Jewish paradise]]" for its religious tolerance, had attracted tens of thousands of Jews who fled persecution from other European countries—though, at times, discrimination against Jews surfaced in Poland, as it did elsewhere in Europe.  Poland was a major spiritual and cultural center for [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. 

At the start of the [[Second World War]], Poland had the largest Jewish population in the world (over 3.3 million, some 10% of the general Polish population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Poland.html|title = Poland Virtual Jewish History Tour|website = Jewish Virtual Library|publisher = American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vast majority were killed in the [[Holocaust]] during the [[Germany|German]] occupation of Poland, under the [[Nazi]] "[[Final Solution]]" mass-extermination program.  Only 369,000 (11%) of Poland's Jews survived the War. 

Since massive postwar emigration, the Polish-Jewish population has stood at somewhere between 50,000 and 200,000.

The list below includes persons of Jewish faith or ancestry.

This is a '''list of [[mosque]]s in the [[Philippines]]'''. Prior to the usage of the common Arabic style merged with modernist style mosque architecture, the vernacular mosques of the Philippines used to be the hut-style and the pagoda-style, which were very common until the late 19th century. Most of the mosques in the Philippines today have common Islamic architectures imported from Arabia, though some vernacular pagoda-style mosques can still be seen in Mindanao such as the Masjid Datu Untong Balabaran of Taviran in [[Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao]]. There have been proposals to put the '''Heritage Mosques of the Philippines''' into the Philippine tentative list for [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] declaration in the future. The proposals made were to input the historic mosques of the Philippines (mosque in Simunul), to input the vernacular mosques of the Philippines (langga/rangga-style and pagoda-style mosques), or to combine both and input them in the tentative list of [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_the_Philippines&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mosque Classification in the Philippines==

There are two classifications of mosques in the Philippines, namely: (1) ''Masjid'', which is associated with any place of worship and includes a bulbous dome and a minaret as an architectural element. It is a large and more permanent structure, built on foundations, often to be found near a river or body of water, where the faithful perform rituals of ablution. (2) ''Langgal'' (in Tausug) or ''Ranggar'' (in Maranao), which means “to meet”, refers to a small semi-permanent prayer structure built for the convenience of the faithful and mostly in rural areas. There is a third type which uses a pagoda-style architecture, but have been dethroned by the masjid (Arabian-style mosque).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/295574360/1c-Philippine-Architecture&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Maranaw Mosque miniature.jpg|thumb|Aga khan museum's miniature of a traditional Maranaw mosque]]

==Architectural types of mosques in the Philippines==
Very little is known about the architectural designs of mosque types in the Philippines. This is due to several factors: (1) much of the earliest types of mosques constructed by early missionaries were made of temporary materials like wood, bamboo, and cogon which do not last for years; (2) the remaining earlier types were either demolished, destroyed during earthquakes, or reconstructed/remodelled to suit modern architectural types based on the middle-east designs; (3) the yearly pilgrimage to Mecca radically changed all earliest types; and (4) very little has been written about the subject.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/in-focus/a-look-at-philippine-mosques/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]], the main cultural arm of the Philippine government, it is possible that the sampling of the mosque types in Lanao might represent the “typical” mosques in the Philippines prior to the importation of mosque architecture from Arabia, as Islam was introduced to the Sulu archipelago first, followed by Maguindanao, and then Lanao. Both Sulu and Maguindanao have lost almost all of their non-Arabian style mosque architectural knowledge, making Lanao the last area where such knowledge is still extant, although some pockets still exist in Sulu and Maguindanao. One of the earliest types of mosques in Lanao is a five-tiered building resembling a Chinese pagoda. A variation of this type is a three-tiered  or seven-tiered edifice. The earliest mosque in Simunul, [[Tawi-tawi]] was initially built through the pagoda-style. Its 4 pillars are still there after more than 400 years. Another example of vernacular mosque in the Philippines is the Masgit sa Buadi Sakayo located, a mosque in Lanao that resembles a Buddhist temple with okir motifs. Other early types of mosques are found in the eastern coasts of Lake Lanao, where some mosques have okir motifs and burak (centaur) depictions some mirrors engraved on the panels of the mosque. Some early type mosques also has inverted jars on top of their domes.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/in-focus/a-look-at-philippine-mosques/&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lanao, a huge drum called tabo is suspended horizontally inside the mosque and is beaten to call the believers to the mosque. Among the Yakan, a bamboo drum is used for calling people to worship. Inside the mosque, one does not find a pulpit (mimbar) but an elevated platform, a chair or a structure, where the khatib delivers his sermon. Philippine mosques do not have a sahn (courtyard) like those of Middle East mosques. Instead, they have benches outside where people sit and talk while waiting for the next prayer. According to Filipino Muslims, it is not permitted to discuss unIslamic matter inside the mosques.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/in-focus/a-look-at-philippine-mosques/&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the types of mosque architecture in the Philippines can be divided into three, namely:
*Langgal/ranggar - small structures for the faithful, and is usually built in rural areas (like the small chapels in Catholicism). These are the oldest form of mosque in the Philippines. The langgal/ranggar-style mosques are still being built and used in Islamic areas in the Philippines, especially in rural areas.
*Pagoda-style Mosque - used by Muslims throughout Islamic areas in the Philippines prior to the importation of the Arabian-style mosque architecture. It is similar to the pagoda-style places of worship in Malaysia and Indonesia, specifically, [[Bali]]. The pagoda-style mosques are largely attributed to Hindu and Buddhist pasts of the current Muslim areas in the Philippines. These mosques have eight, five, or three tiers, making them look as if they are pathways to heaven. The pagoda-style mosque building is currently an endangered art form in the Philippines, as most mosques are now built in the Domed/Arabian-style.
*Onion-domed/Arabian-style Mosque - currently the most prominent and widespread style used in building mosques in the Philippines. The Domed/Arabian-style was imported to the Philippines when Filipino Muslims began performing the hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). On their journey, they saw the mosques of Arabia and copied it, replacing the pagoda-style mosques in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitaleducation.net/epa-web/philippine-architecture-forms-and-types/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Madeleine Delbrêl''' (1904–1964) was a French Catholic author, poet, and mystic, whose works include ''The Marxist City as Mission Territory'' (1957), ''The Contemporary Forms of Atheism'' (1962), and the posthumous publications ''We, the Ordinary People of the Streets'' (1966) and ''The Joy of Believing'' (1968).  She came to the Catholic faith after a youth spent as a atheist.  She has been cited by Cardinal [[Roger Etchegaray]] as an example for young people to follow in "the arduous battle of holiness."&lt;ref name="Delbrel"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Casarella |first1=Peter  |last2= |first2= |year=2001 |title=Madeleine Delbrel--a French Dorothy Day--writes ''We, the Ordinary People of the Streets'' |journal=Houston Catholic Worker |publisher= Casa Juan Diego|volume=XXI |issue=2 |pages= |url= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Madeleine died unexpectedly from a brain hemorrhage in 1964.

==Early life==
Madeleine Delbrel was born in [[Mussidan]], France. Her father was of an artistic disposition, and Madeleine inherited his interest in and talent for writing. Throughout her childhood, she lived in several different places, and was never able to feel at home or make friends anywhere. Her parents were not religious, so Madeleine was an atheist by age of fifteen, experiencing life as absurd. At seventeen she wrote a tract titled: "God is dead--long live!" which expresses her view that death is the only certainty in life.
Consequently, she lived life to the fullest, writing and illustrating poetry, studying philosophy and art at the Sorbonne in Paris, designing her own fashions, and being one of the first women of her society to cut her hair short.
However, when her fiancé suddenly decided to join the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and her father went blind, her life fell apart. At the same time she began to notice that life did not seem absurd to her Christian friends, who still enjoyed life as much as she did. Suddenly, God's existence did not seem a complete impossibility anymore. She decided to kneel and pray, and also remembered [[Teresa of Avila]]'s recommendation to silently think of God for five minutes each day.
Madeleine called the year of 1924 the year of her conversion. For in praying she found God—or as she felt, he found her. To her he was someone to love just like any other person. At first she considered taking the veil and entering the [[Carmelite order]], but then felt called upon to be in touch with people and help them lead happier lives. She joined the Girl Scouts, then led a group of women in Ivry, a small working-class town, with the goal of simply caring, consoling, aiding, and establishing good contact with the people. She then took a degree in Social Studies and was employed by the city government of Ivry, where she worked throughout [[World War II]] and thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;''The Little Monk'' by Madeleine Delbrel (Pg. 107-109)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a movement underway advocating for her [[beatification]].

Weightman, tr. ''From Honey to Ashes'', London:Cape 1973 (''Du miel aux cendres'', Paris 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; and has played an important role in the mythology of some peoples. In [[Norse mythology]], for example, the [[Mead of Poetry]] was crafted from the blood of the wise being [[Kvasir]] and turned the drinker into a poet or scholar.

The terms "mead" and "honey-wine" often are used synonymously.&lt;ref name="Morse"&gt;{{cite book| last=Morse| first=Roger | title=Making Mead (Honey Wine) | publisher=Wicwas Press | year=1992 | isbn=978-1878075048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schramm"&gt;{{cite book| last=Schramm| first=Ken | title=The Compleat Meadmaker: Home Production of Honey Wine From Your First Batch to Award-winning Fruit and Herb Variations | publisher=Brewers Publications | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-937381-80-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures, though, differentiate honey-wine from mead. For example, Hungarians hold that while mead is made of honey, water and beer-yeast (barm), honey-wine is watered honey fermented by [[wikt:recrement|recrement]] of grapes or other fruits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pepin.blogter.hu/89805/a_sor_es_a_magyar_mult History of beer in Hungary] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20100928002015/http://pepin.blogter.hu/89805/a_sor_es_a_magyar_mult |date=28 September 2010 }} – difference between mead and honey-wine (in Hungarian)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Pottery vessels dating from 7000 BC discovered in northern China have shown chemical signatures consistent with the presence of honey, rice, and organic compounds associated with fermentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odinsson|first1=Eoghan|title=Northern Lore: A Field Guide to the Northern Mind-Body-Spirit|date=2010|isbn=9781452851433|page=159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V3sCCLcsJFkC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=archaeological+evidence+mead+bc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiepISenfrTAhUDYlAKHaWuDP4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=archaeological%20evidence%20mead%20bc&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGovern"&gt;[https://www.penn.museum/sites/biomoleculararchaeology/?page_id=247].

The earliest surviving description of mead is in the hymns of the ''[[Rigveda]]'',&lt;ref name="Rigveda"&gt;[[Rigveda]] [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv05043.htm Book 5 v. 43:3–4], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv08005.htm Book 8 v. 5:6], etc&lt;/ref&gt; one of the sacred books of the [[historical Vedic religion]] and (later) [[Hinduism]] dated around 1700–1100 BC. During the [[Golden Age]] of [[ancient Greece]], mead was said to be the preferred drink.&lt;ref name="Kerenyi"&gt;{{cite book| last=Kerenyi | first =Karl| title=Dionysus: Archetypal Image of Indestructible Life | publisher=[[Princeton University]] Press | year=1976| page =35| isbn=0-691-09863-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE) discussed mead in his ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorologica]]'' and elsewhere, while [[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79 CE) called mead ''militites'' in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' and differentiated wine sweetened with honey or "honey-wine" from mead.&lt;ref name="Pliny"&gt;{{cite book| last=[[Pliny the Elder]] | title=Natural History XIV | pages=XII:85 etc| nopp=true }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hispanic-Roman naturalist [[Columella]] gave a recipe for mead in ''[[De re rustica]]'', about 60 CE.

{{quote|Take rainwater kept for several years, and mix a [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|sextarius]]&lt;ref&gt;about half a liter&lt;/ref&gt; of this water with a [Roman] [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|pound]]&lt;ref&gt;about 1/3 kg&lt;/ref&gt; of honey. For a weaker mead, mix a sextarius of water with nine [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|ounces]]&lt;ref&gt;about ¼ kilograms&lt;/ref&gt; of honey. The whole is exposed to the sun for 40 days, and then left on a shelf near the fire. If you have no rain water, then boil spring water.&lt;ref&gt;Columella, 60 AD ''De re rustica''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Beowulf - meodu scencu.jpg|thumb|A mention of "meodu scencu" (mead-cup) in the ''Beowulf'']]
There is a poem attributed to the [[Brythonic Languages|Brythonic-speaking]] [[bard]] [[Taliesin]], who lived around 550 CE, called the ''{{lang|cy|Kanu y med}}'' or "Song of Mead".&lt;ref name="Book of Taliesin"&gt;''[[Book of Taliesin|Llyfr Taliesin]]'' XIX&lt;/ref&gt; The legendary drinking, feasting and boasting of warriors in the [[mead hall]] is echoed in the mead hall ''Din Eidyn'' (modern day [[Edinburgh]]) as depicted in the poem ''[[Y Gododdin]]'', attributed to the poet Aneirin who would have been a contemporary of Taliesin. In the Old English epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', the Danish warriors drank mead. In both Insular Celtic and Germanic cultures mead was the primary heroic drink in poetry.

Later, taxation and regulations governing the ingredients of alcoholic beverages led to commercial mead becoming a more obscure beverage until recently.&lt;ref name="Buhner"&gt;{{cite book| last=Buhner| first=Stephen Harrod | title=Sacred and Herbal Healing Beers: The Secrets of Ancient Fermentation | publisher=Siris Books | year=1998 | isbn=0-937381-66-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Monastery|monasteries]] kept up the old traditions of mead-making as a by-product of [[beekeeping]], especially in areas where [[grape]]s could not be grown.

== Etymology ==
The English ''mead'' &amp;ndash; "fermented honey drink" &amp;ndash; derives from the [[Old English]] ''meodu'' or ''medu'', and Proto-Germanic, *''meduz'' (source also of Old Norse mjöðr, Danish mjød, Old Frisian and Middle Dutch mede, Old High German metu, German Met "mead").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/mead#etymonline_v_12487|title=Mead|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper| date=2018|accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Madh'', and the related terms ''mad'' (मद, مد) and ''madira'' (मदिरा, مدِرا), also mean alcohol.&lt;ref name="ref75guyic"&gt;{{Citation | title=Allied Chambers transliterated Hindi-Hindi-English dictionary |author1=Henk W. Wagenaar |author2=S.S. Parikh |author3=D.F. Plukker |author4=R.

Wine; honey; intoxication; spirits ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; These words are all derived from the [[Sanskrit]] language, and are [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[cognate]]s of the [[English language|English]] ''[[mead]]'', [[Greek language|Greek]] ''μέθυ'', [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''madu'', [[Persian language|Persian]] ''may'',&lt;ref name="ref65vapuj"&gt;{{Citation | title=Hittite Etymological Dictionary | author=Jaan Puhvel | publisher=Walter de Gruyter, 2004 | isbn=978-3-11-018162-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XROpWC99BD0C | quote=... IE *medhu- basically meant 'sweet' ... Ved. madhu, Toch. B mit, Lith. medus, OCS medu honey ... Ved. madhu [svadu madhu 'sweet mead'], OIr mid, We. medd ... Gk. μέθν ... Avest. madu-, [[Persian language|Persian]] ''mey'' 'wine' ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''medus'', [[German language|German]] ''Met'' and [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''мєдъ'' (medŭ).

In this sense, these terms are also used for additional words related to alcohol. For instance, ''madhushala'' is a Hindi word for an establishment that serves alcohol, as is ''madiralaya'' (lit. ''abode of alcohol'', c.f. [[himalaya]], ''abode of snow''). ''Madmast'' (मदमस्त, مدمست) means ''intoxicated due to alcohol'', and is a word frequently used in poetry and song in the region, sometimes as a stylized reference to being in an emotional state resembling intoxication for other reasons, such as romantic love.&lt;ref name="ref69quqez"&gt;{{Citation | title=Aspects, voix et diathèses en hindi moderne: syntaxe, sémantique, énonciation | author=Annie Montaut | publisher=Peeters Publishers, 1991 | isbn=978-90-6831-349-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swQ87C5wBVMC | quote=''... dusro ko pi:kar madmast banne do, tum bhi: pi:kar madmast bano ... laisse les autres s'enivrer en buvant, toi aussi enivre toi en buvant ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fermentation process==
The yeast used in mead making is often identical to that used in [[Yeast in winemaking#Types of yeasts used in winemaking|wine making]]. Many home mead makers choose to use wine yeasts (particularly those used in the preparation of white wines) to make their meads.&lt;ref name="meadmaking"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bjcp.org/mead/makingmead.pdf | title=Making Mead: the Art and the Science | publisher=Beer Judge Certification Program | accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By measuring the specific gravity of the mead once before fermentation and throughout the fermentation process by means of a [[hydrometer]] or [[refractometer]], mead makers can determine the proportion of alcohol by volume that will appear in the final product. This also serves another purpose. By measuring specific gravity throughout fermentation, a mead maker can quickly troubleshoot a "stuck" batch, one where the fermentation process has been halted prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Compleat Meadmaker | publisher=Brewers Publications | author=Schramm, Ken | year=2003 | pages=31, 37 | isbn=978-0-937381-80-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meads will often ferment well at the same temperatures in which wine is fermented.

After primary fermentation slows down significantly the mead is then racked into a second container. This is known as secondary fermentation. Some larger commercial fermenters are designed to allow both primary and secondary fermentation to happen inside of the same vessel. Racking is done for two reasons: it lets the mead sit away from the remains of the yeast cells ([[Lees (fermentation)|lees]]) that have died during the fermentation process. Second, this lets the mead have time to clear. If the mead maker wishes to backsweeten the product or prevent it from oxidizing, [[potassium metabisulfite]] and [[potassium sorbate]] are added. After the mead clears, it is bottled and distributed.

==Varieties==
Mead can have a wide range of flavors depending on the source of the honey, additives (also known as "adjuncts" or "[[gruit]]") including fruit and spices, the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] employed during [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]], and the aging procedure.&lt;ref name="Eoghan"&gt;Eoghan Odinsson, ''Northern Lore'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=V3sCCLcsJFkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=bg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 160]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some producers have marketed white wine sweetened and flavored with honey after fermentation as mead, sometimes spelling it "meade."&lt;ref name="Eoghan"/&gt; This is closer in style to a [[hypocras]]. Blended varieties of mead may be known by the style represented; for instance, a mead made with cinnamon and apples may be referred to as either a cinnamon ''cyser'' or an apple metheglin.
[[File:Trnavska medovina.jpg|thumb|Slovak Medovina or Včelovina Apimed. The mead is produced in the city of Trnava and has won international recognition during the [[Mazer Cup]]. This particular mead is brewed in an old Slavic Style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.startitup.sk/slovenska-medovina-sa-stala-najlepsou-svete/|title=Slovenská medovina sa stala najlepšou na svete|date=2017-03-19|work=StartItUp.sk|access-date=2017-12-21|language=sk-SK}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A mead that also contains [[spices]] (such as [[clove]]s, [[cinnamon]] or [[nutmeg]]), or [[herb]]s (such as [[meadowsweet]], [[hops]], or even [[lavender]] or [[chamomile]]), is called a ''metheglin'' {{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|θ|ɛ|ɡ|l|ɪ|n}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tayleur|first=W.H.T.|author2=Michael Spink|title=The Penguin Book of Home Brewing and Wine-Making|publisher=Penguin|year=1973|isbn=0-14-046190-6|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aylett, Mary (1953). ''Country Wines'', Odhams Press. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

A mead that contains fruit (such as [[raspberry]], [[blackberry]] or [[strawberry]]) is called a ''melomel'',&lt;ref name="Tayleur, p.291"&gt;Tayleur, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; which was also used as a means of [[food preservation]], keeping summer produce for the winter. A mead that is fermented with grape juice is called a ''pyment''.&lt;ref name="Tayleur, p.291"/&gt;

[[Mulled wine|Mulled]] mead is a popular drink at Christmas time, where mead is flavored with spices (and sometimes various fruits) and warmed, traditionally by having a hot poker plunged into it.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Some meads retain some measure of the sweetness of the original honey, and some may even be considered as dessert wines.  Drier meads are also available, and some producers offer sparkling meads.

There are faux-meads, which are actually wines with honey added after fermentation as a sweetener and flavoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gotmead.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=1094 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215031113/http://www.gotmead.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=1094 |archivedate=15 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, meads were fermented with wild [[yeast]]s and [[bacteria]] (as noted in the recipe quoted above) residing on the skins of the fruit or within the honey itself. Wild yeasts can produce inconsistent results. Yeast companies have isolated strains of yeast which produce consistently appealing products. Brewers, winemakers and mead makers commonly use them for fermentation, including yeast strains identified specifically for mead fermentation. These are strains that have been selected because of their characteristic of preserving delicate honey flavors and aromas.

Mead can also be distilled to a brandy or liqueur strength. A version called "honey jack" can be made by partly freezing a quantity of mead and straining the ice out of the liquid (a process known as [[Fractional freezing#Freeze distillation|freeze distillation]]), in the same way that [[applejack (beverage)|applejack]] is made from [[cider]].

===Regional variants===
In [[Finland]], a sweet mead called ''{{lang|fi|[[Sima (mead)|sima]]}}'' ([[cognate]] with the [[root (linguistics)|root]] of [[zymurgy]]{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}) is still an essential seasonal fermented product connected with the Finnish [[Walpurgis Night|Vappu]] ([[May Day]]) festival. It is usually spiced by adding both the pulp and rind of a [[lemon]]. During [[secondary fermentation (wine)|secondary fermentation]], [[raisin]]s are added to control the amount of sugars and to act as an indicator of readiness for consumption; they will rise to the top of the bottle when the drink is ready. However, the sugar used in modern practice is typically [[brown sugar]], not honey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elisa.net/uutiset/ruoka/?id=4104 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605085106/http://elisa.net/uutiset/ruoka/?id=4104 |archivedate=5 June 2013 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ET Amhara asv2018-02 img077 Lake Tana at Bahir Dar.jpg|thumb|Ethiopian mead ([[Tej]])]]
[[Ethiopia]]n mead is called ''[[tej]]'' (ጠጅ, {{IPA-am|ˈtʼədʒ|}}) and is usually home-made. It is flavored with the powdered leaves and bark of ''gesho'', a [[Hops|hop-like]] [[bittering agent]] which is a species of [[buckthorn]].  A sweeter, less-alcoholic version called ''berz'', aged for a shorter time, is also made.  The traditional vessel for drinking ''tej'' is a rounded vase-shaped container called a ''berele''.

Mead known as iQhilika is traditionally prepared by the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] of [[South Africa]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}

* '''Rhodomel''': Rhodomel is made from honey, [[rose hip]]s, rose petals or [[rose oil|rose attar]], and water. From the Greek {{lang|grc|ῥοδόμελι}} ''rhodomeli'', literally "rose-honey".
* '''Rubamel''': A specific type of Melomel made with raspberries.
* '''Sack mead''': This refers to mead that is made with more honey than is typically used.  The finished product contains a higher-than-average ethanol concentration (meads at or above 14% ABV are generally considered to be of [[sack (wine)|sack]] strength) and often retains a high [[specific gravity]] and elevated levels of sweetness, although dry sack meads (which have no residual sweetness) can be produced.  According to one theory, the name derives from the [[fortified wine|fortified]] [[dessert wine]], [[sherry]] (which is sometimes sweetened after fermentation) that, in England, once bore the nickname "sack").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=2790 Sack] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726232320/http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=2790 |date=26 July 2008 }} in the ''Oxford Companion to Wine''&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that the term is a phonetic reduction of "[[sake]]" the name of a Japanese beverage that was introduced to the West by Spanish and Portuguese traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Saké |volume=24 |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Short mead''': Also called "quick mead". A type of mead recipe that is meant to age quickly, for immediate consumption.  Because of the techniques used in its creation, short mead shares some qualities found in cider (or even [[light ale]]): primarily that it is [[carbonation|effervescent]], and often has a cidery taste.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  It can also be champagne-like.
* '''Show mead''': A term which has come to mean "plain" mead: that which has honey and water as a base, with no fruits, spices or extra flavorings. Since honey alone often does not provide enough nourishment for the yeast to carry on its life cycle, a mead that is devoid of fruit, etc. will sometimes require a special [[yeast nutrient]] and other [[enzyme]]s to produce an acceptable finished product. In most competitions, including all those that subscribe to the [[BJCP]] style guidelines, as well as the [[International Mead Fest]], the term "traditional mead" refers to this variety (because mead is historically a variable product, these guidelines are a recent expedient, designed to provide a common language for competition judging; style guidelines ''per se'' do not apply to commercial or historical examples of this or any other type of mead).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
* '''[[Sima (mead)|Sima]]''': a quick-fermented low-alcoholic Finnish variety, seasoned with lemon and associated with the festival of [[vappu]].
* '''[[Tej]]/Mes''': Tej/Mes is an Ethiopian and Eritrean mead, fermented with wild yeasts and the addition of ''[[gesho]]''.
* '''[[Tella]]/Suwa''': Tella is an Ethiopian and Eritrean style of beer; with the inclusion of honey some recipes are similar to ''[[Mead#Mead variants|braggot]]''.
* '''[[Mead in Poland|Trójniak]]''' &lt;small&gt;([[Protected Geographical Status|TSG]])&lt;/small&gt;: A Polish mead, made using two units of water for each unit of honey.
* '''Včelovina''': [[Slovakia|Slovak]] alternative name for mead.
* '''White mead''': A mead that is colored white with herbs, fruit or, sometimes, egg whites.

==In literature==
{{see also|Mead of poetry}}
Mead is featured in many [[Germanic mythology|Germanic myths]] and folktales such as ''[[Beowulf]]'', as well as in other popular works that draw on these myths. Notable examples include books by [[J.K. Rowling]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]], [[George R. R. Martin]], [[T. H. White]], and [[Neil Gaiman]]. It is often featured in books using a historical Germanic setting and in writings about the [[Viking age]]. Mead is mentioned many times in Neil Gaiman's 2001 novel, ''[[American Gods]]''; it is referred to as the drink of the gods. In ''[[The Inheritance Cycle]]'' series by [[Christopher Paolini]], the protagonist, [[Eragon]], often drinks mead at feasts. It is also referenced in ''[[The Kingkiller Chronicle]]'' novel series by [[Patrick Rothfuss]]. The protagonist Kvothe is known to drink metheglin. The non-existent "Greysdale Mead" is also drunk, although it is merely water. The drink of mead is mentioned many times in Michael Crichton's "Eaters of the Dead" published 1976.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1878">The '''Men of Understanding''' (in Latin '''''Homines Intelligentiae''''') is the name assumed by a heretical sect (from the Catholic point of view) in the Low Countries, which in 1410-11 was cited before the [[Inquisition]] at Brussels.
 
==History==
The sect was doctrinally related with the earlier [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]]. It taught the eventual salvation of all human beings and even of the demons, maintained that the soul of man cannot be defiled by bodily sin, and believed in a mystical state of illumination and union with God so perfect that it exempted from all subjection to moral and ecclesiastical laws and was an infallible pledge of salvation.
 
Both its leaders, Egidius Cantoris, an illiterate layman, and the [[Carmelite]] William of Hildernissen, near [[Bergen-op-Zoom]], gloried in the visions with which they claimed to have been favoured. Cantoris in a moment of religious exaltation went so far as to run nude through the streets of [[Brussels]], declaring himself the saviour of mankind.
 
About 1410 [[Peter d'Ailly]], [[Bishop of Cambrai]], seems to have taken the first steps towards the suppression of the heresy. William of Hildernissen consented to a retraction, the sincerity of which appeared doubtful. In 1411, a second investigation resulted in another retraction, but also in a sentence compelling William to return permanently to an extra-diocesan Carmelite monastery after three years' detention in one of the episcopal castles. No information has reached us respecting the result of the inquisitorial procedure against the other members of the sect.

The '''Muslim Students Association of South Africa''' is a representative collective of the various Muslim Students Association (MSA) chapters which can be found in the different tertiary institutions throughout South Africa.

== History ==
The once strong Muslim Students Association of South Africa (est. 1974), which had branches on many tertiary campuses, became less vocal and thus lost its grip on student activities; the MSA was thus replaced by Islamic societies that were either independent or affiliates of other Muslim organizations outside these institutions. The Muslim Students Association of South Africa has recently been very active once again. The first National Muslim Students Association of South Africa Conference (first in the last 10 years) was held in Durban in January 2004. MSA representatives from all over the country met here. This was hoped to be a new future of student work in the country.

== MSA Chapters in South Africa ==
The following MSA chapters are found in South Africa&lt;br /&gt;
TUKS MSA - [[University of Pretoria]]&lt;br /&gt;
UCT MSA - [[University of Cape Town]]&lt;br /&gt;
UKZN MSA - [[University of KwaZulu Natal]]&lt;br /&gt;
UJ MSA - [[University of Johannesburg]]&lt;br /&gt;
UWC MSA - [[University of the Western Cape]]&lt;br /&gt;
US - [[University of Stellenbosch]]&lt;br /&gt;
MSA RHODES - [Rhodes University - Grahamstown]&lt;br /&gt;
PUKKE MSA - [[North West University - Potchefstroom Campus]]&lt;br/&gt;
CPUT MSA - ([[Cape Peninsula University of Technology]] - (Bellville Campus)

== MSA National Camp ==
An annual camp is usually held in KwaZulu Natal where all members of MSA's across the country are invited to participate in discussion around issues affecting MSA's in general, as well covering aspects of Muslim Leadership in the South African context.

== The Message Magazine ==
The Message Magazine is currently (2009) a national student magazine, produced and published by MSA members from many different universities. It began (2001) as a monthly newsletter by the MSA at the University of Natal - Durban and was edited and produced by Bilal Randeree and Mariam Jhaveri. By 2003, the newsletter had become a full colour glossy magazine, still produced out of Durban, but with contributors and distribution nationally.

'''Path Press''' is a non-profit entity, which handles legal matters and holds the [[copyrights]] of all [[Nanavira Thera|Ven. Ñāṇavīra Thera]]'s writings together with some the writings from others; '''Path Press Publications''' is an independent non-profit [[publisher]] of books by [[Nanavira Thera|Ven. Ñāṇavīra Thera]] and the writings of [[Samanera Bodhesako]]. It has its office in the Netherlands. 

The '''Path Press''' is also a society whose goal is to explain and spread the [[dhamma|doctrine]] of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. It was founded in [[Sri Lanka]] in 1987 by [[Samanera Bodhesako]].  Originally conceived as a limited effort to publish [[Clearing the Path]] but later become an entity who is holding copyrights of writing of Ñāṇavīra Thera and it consist of the small group of 4 [[bhikkhu]]s and 5 layman ([[Upasaka|upāsakas]]) who are aspiring to make late Ven. Ñāṇavīra Thera's teachings more available for those who are interested.
{{Buddhism}}
== About ==
'''Path Press''' was a name of convenience, originally intended to include those who, through the years, have contributed their various talents to bring ''Clearing the Path'' to realization. Path Press was not planned to be an ongoing [[publishing house]]. However, it now turns out that there remains sufficient worthwhile materials from the writings of the Venerable [[Nanavira Thera|Ven. Ñāṇavīra Thera]] to issue other volumes to the present work; and there are a few other writings, unpublished or now out of print, which, like ''Clearing the Path'', are of high quality, worthy of publication or reprinting. Therefore, it was established a publishing house, called 'Path Press Publications'.

These writings are probably not commercially viable; nor do they represent the views of any established sect, school or university which might sponsor their publication. The idea has been put forward that inasmuch as Path Press has already published one book of this type it could use that experience as a basis for issuing those occasional writings which are of exceptional merit and yet do not attract established publishers.

== Clearing the Path (1960–1965) ==
[[Image:Nanavira_Thera.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Nanavira Thera|Ven. Ñāṇavīra Thera]].]]
Clearing the Path was the most important work for Path Press. 

In 1963, Ñāṇavīra Thera completed a book called '''''Notes on Dhamma''''' (1960–1963), which was privately published by the Honourable Lionel Samaratunga in the same year (250 copies). Following production of that volume, the author amended and added to the text, leaving at his death an expanded [[typescript]], indicated by the titular expansion of its dates, (1960–1965). ''Notes on Dhamma'' has been variously described as "arrogant, scathing, and condescending",&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.,'' p.161 (Letter 3)&lt;/ref&gt; as "a fantastic system", and as "the most important book to be written in this century". Ñāṇavīra Thera himself remarked of the book that "it is vain to hope that it is going to win general approval... but I do allow myself to hope that a few individuals... will have private transformations of their way of thinking as a result of reading them".&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.,'' p.353 (Letter 84)&lt;/ref&gt; 

And the influence of ''Notes on Dhamma'' on [[Buddhist]] thinkers continues to increase more than three decades after its publication. This book has aroused extreme interest and controversy. The ''Notes'' "attempt to provide an intellectual basis for the understanding of the Suttas without abandoning ''saddhā'' (faith)";&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.,'' p.305 (Letter 60)&lt;/ref&gt; that they "have been written with the purpose of clearing away a mass of dead matter which is choking the Suttas";&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.,'' p.339 (Letter 76)&lt;/ref&gt; and that, above all, "the ''Notes'' are designed to be an invitation to the reader to come and share the author's point of view". The ''Notes'' assume that the reader's sole interest in the ''[[Pali]] [[Suttas]]'' is a concern for his own welfare. However, the ''Notes'', with their admitted intellectual and conceptual difficulties, are not the only way to discuss right view or to offer right-view guidance. 

'''''Letters''''' are a selection of 150 letters written by Ñāṇavīra Thera from his ''kuti'' in the Bundala Forest Reserve to local and foreign readers of the ''Notes'' who had requested explanation and clarification. Some are thinly disguised essays in a wholly modern idiom. The letters which are collected and published in ''Clearing the Path'' are not only something of a commentary on the ''Notes''; they are, independently, a lucid discussion of how an individual concerned fundamentally with self-disclosure deals with the [[dilemma]] of finding himself in an intolerable situation, where the least undesirable alternative is [[suicide]].

With openness, calmness, and considerable wit Ñāṇavīra Thera discusses with his [[correspondents]] (including his doctor, a judge, a provincial businessman, a barrister, a British diplomat, and another British citizen) the [[illnesses]] that plague him and what he can and cannot do about them, and about his own [[existence]]. His life as a [[Buddhist monk]] in a remote jungle abode is not incidental to the [[philosophy]] he expounds: the two are different aspects of the same thing, namely a vision that penetrates into the human situation both as universal and as particular, and recognizes that it is this situation which it is the business of each of us to resolve for ourselves. In presenting this view Ñāṇavīra Thera offers a contemporary exposition of the Teaching of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. In living this view he evokes a dramatic situation wherein an individual resolutely faces those questions which every lucid person must eventually face. The letters are in [[language]], [[idiom]] and quotations from a galaxy of thinkers such as [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[Heidegger]], [[Kierkegaard]], [[Sartre]], [[Kafka]]. Though familiar to a Western reader, it can be incomprehensible in part, to anyone without such background.

Most of the editorial work connected with Ñāṇavīra Thera's writings was performed by [[Samanera Bodhesako|Sāmanera Bodhesako]] (Robert Smith), who died in [[Kathmandu]] in 1988. During the last years of his life in [[Sri Lanka]] he founded Path Press which published ''Clearing the Path: Writings of Ñāṇavīra Thera (1960-1965)''. He also worked as editor for the [[Buddhist Publication Society]] in [[Kandy]] which published ''The Tragic, The Comic &amp; The Personal: Selected Letters of Ñāṇavīra Thera (Wheel 339/341)''&lt;ref&gt;''The Tragic, The Comic &amp; The Personal: Selected Letters of Ñāṇavīra Thera (Wheel 339/341)'', [[Buddhist Publication Society]] (1987) {{ISBN|955-24-0000-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1987. Prof. Forrest Williams of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] also participated as the co-editor of ''Clearing the Path''. It is now out of print. The [[Buddhist Cultural Centre]] decided to issue it in its two constituent parts, ''Notes on Dhamma'' and ''Letters''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6686">[[File:Philippine Benevolent Missionaries Association Shrine, San Jose, Dinagat Islands, Philippines.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Philippine Benevolent Missionaries Association, Divine Master's Shrine, [[Aurelio, Dinagat Islands|Aurelio]], [[San Jose, Dinagat Islands]].]]

The '''Philippine Benevolent Missionaries Association, Inc.''' ('''PBMA''') is a non-sectarian and non-profit charitable religious [[fraternity|fraternal organization]] for men and women in the Philippines founded by [[Ruben Ecleo|Ruben Edera Ecleo Sr.]] in 1965 on the [[Philippines|Philippine]] island of [[Dinagat Island|Dinagat]], off the coast of [[Mindanao]]. Upon the senior Ecleo's death in 1987, he was succeeded by his son '''Ruben B. Ecleo Jr.''' PBMA has an estimated million members in the central and southern Philippines and abroad. It was registered with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), in [[Makati]], [[Philippines]] on October 19, 1965 under the Registration No. 28042. Its main office is located at [[San Jose, Dinagat Islands|San Jose]], Province of [[Dinagat Islands]].

''[[The Manila Times]]'' estimates the group has raised at least [[Philippine peso|P]]35 million in entrance fees from its members since its founding&lt;ref name="shoot-out"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2052994.stm Philippines shoot-out leaves 17 dead] BBC News June 19, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="founder"&gt;"[http://www.rickross.com/reference/pbma/pbma1.html PBMA founder a 'Christ-like' figure]" Manila Times Gomez, Herbie June 9, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
According to sect doctrine, Ecleo Sr. was trained by "voices" to fluently read and write [[Arabic]], [[Hebrew]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[Aramaic]], in order to interpret the ancient mysteries. He also made predictions of the future based on [[Akashic records]]. PBMA followers also viewed Ecleo Sr. as a Christ-like figure, who could accomplish anything by reciting the [[Mantra]], and like the Christ of the [[Bible]], was also able to [[resurrect]] the dead. Ecleo's healing abilities were stated to have directly come from "our Divine Father by virtue of the sacred or divine prayers which are called in [[Occultism]] as Mantras."
&lt;ref name="founder"&gt;"[http://www.rickross.com/reference/pbma/pbma1.html PBMA founder a 'Christ-like' figure]" Manila Times Gomez, Herbie June 9, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Sect leaders also stated that Ecleo Sr. has since his childhood been simultaneously present in many disparate locations, possibly as many different people. An example was his doing [[missionary]] work in [[Agusan del Sur]], while also traveling in the province of [[Samar]]. All of his different persona possessed the ability to heal like the "Lord Jesus who first applied these powers in [[Judea]]..."&lt;ref name="founder" /&gt;

==Clashes with law enforcement==
Group members, described by local media organizations as heavily armed and willing to die for their leader, are thwarting police efforts to arrest Ruben Ecleo Jr.  A source for the ''Manila Times'' reported that armed PBMA members have made an oath to protect the "master," referring to Ecleo, who was evading police efforts to arrest him for the murder of his wife, Alona Bacolod-Ecleo, a fourth year [[medical student]]. Alona was found strangled in a rubbish bag at the bottom of a cliff on Cebu island in January 2002.&lt;ref name="founder" /&gt;

===Parricide and Graft Cases===
Ecleo Jr. was arrested after a bloody raid by law enforcement on Dinagat on June 19, 2002. Gunfire had erupted as a joint force of [[Philippine National Police]] and troopers from the [[Philippine Army]]'s 20th Infantry Battalion moved in to serve an [[arrest warrant]]. The raid had begun after negotiations had broken down and approximately 2,000 PBMA followers had surrounded Ecelo's mansion and barred all access. A firefight with Ecleo's elite team of [[bodyguards]], known as the "White Eagles", then erupted and lasted through the night. Ecleo finally surrendered to police the next morning at 9 a.m. The gun battle during the night left 23 dead, including 1 police [[SWAT]] officer, and 16 armed PBMA members. During the raid, four members of his dead wife's family including Candy Ecleo were gunned down by a member of the PBMA security force in a possible [[cover-up]] attempt; the assailant was killed by police moments later, while attempting to flee the scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rickross.com/reference/pbma/pbma14.html 23 Surigao Cultists Killed as Law Enforcers Arrest Ruben Ecleo Jr.] Serrano, Ben Echeminada, Perseus Philippine Star June 20, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, the [[Sandiganbayan]] sentenced Ecleo Jr. to thirty years in prison for entering a 1993 [[government contract]] in which the government lost about P2.4 million. He was found guilty of three counts of violation of the Republic Act 3019. His [[co-defendant]]s, Anadelia Nalauan-Navarra and Ricardo Santillan, were convicted of twice violating the anti-[[Graft (politics)|graft]] laws and sentenced to six to ten years for each count.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rickross.com/reference/pbma/pbma35.html Cult leader gets 30 years in prison for corruption] Manila Times Torres, Tetch October 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecleo faces the [[parricide]] case before the [[Cebu City]] Regional Trial Court, Branch 23. However, the case dragged because six judges recused. On April 25, 2008, 
6th Judge Geraldine Faith Econg per 24-page resolution recused herself amid accusations and her own admission that two women approached her to ask how much would she need in payment for dropping the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/91485/Another-Cebu-court-judge-inhibits-self-from-Ecleo-case www.gmanews.tv/story,  Another Cebu court judge inhibits self from Ecleo case]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other violence===
There is often violence between the PBMA, other Christian groups, and the security forces in the islands. Such an incident occurred when approximately one hundred members of the rival [[Pulahan]] sect launched an assault on a PBMA shrine on the island of Dinagat, in turn two hundred PBMA members counterattacked and hacked to death ten Pulahan followers as well as their leader Edecio Quinanola.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1072120.stm Filipino cultists hacked to death] BBC News December 15, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scientology]] and [[Dianetics]], a "'''rundown'''" is "a series of steps which are [[auditing (Scientology)|auditing actions and processes]] designed to handle a specific aspect of a case and which have a known end phenomena."

==List of rundowns==

===Cause Resurgence Rundown===
According to former church executive [[Mark Rathbun]], it involves running, at your own pace, around a circular track until "you have a realization that you're in control of your own body and mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Running Program|work=Scientology Critical Information Directory|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/scientology/strength-in-their-numbers-more-church-of-scientology-defectors-come/1023717|authors=Joe Childs and Thomas C. Tobin|publisher=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|date=August 2, 2009|accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clear Certainty Rundown===
A procedure in which the state of [[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]] is "validated and rehabilitated". Usually a short action of only a few hours.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faqs.org/faqs/scientology/new-reader-faq/ - Retrieved 20 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This Rundown was introduced in 1985.

===Est Repair Rundown===
A rundown designed for former members of [[Werner Erhard]]'s organization, known as [[Erhard Seminars Training]]. The organization describes this rundown in the book ''What is Scientology?'' in this way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Some people formerly involved in the practices of a group called '''est (Erhard Seminars Training)''' have been found to need case repair. This rundown corrects any damage caused by est's practices, so that it does not hinder any spiritual progress in Dianetics and Scientology training." &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''What is Scientology?'', 1998 softcover edition, pg.680.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===False Purpose Rundown (FPRD)===
This Rundown was first introduced in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;HCOB 5 June 1984 False Purpose Rundown&lt;/ref&gt; although previously its principles were already in use in "Expanded Dianetics". This rundown is specifically designed to detect "evil purposes or evil intentions." The False Purpose Rundown, often referred as the FPRD, is available as a service in most Scientology organizations. It is also in use by the so-called [[Rehabilitation Project Force]] (RPF), where [[Sea Org]] staff may be sent as an opportunity to correct  themselves, although it is considered by some a means of punishment. In some cases a person sometimes is  audited for over a year, until the person considers, himself, "free of evil intentions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesnur.org/2001/london2001/melton.htm|title=CESNUR 2001 - Sea Org (Melton)|first=|last=moreorless|date=|website=www.cesnur.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introspection Rundown===
{{Main|Introspection Rundown}}
This is a procedure that is intended to handle a psychotic break or complete mental breakdown. This rundown made worldwide headlines during the investigation of [[Lisa McPherson|Lisa McPherson's]] death at the [[Fort Harrison Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Thomas C.| last = Tobin| title = Scientologists decry toll of criminal case| url = http://www.sptimes.com/News/030900/TampaBay/Scientologists_decry_.shtml| publisher = [[St. Petersburg Times]]| date = 2000-03-09| accessdate = 2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Douglas| last = Frantz| title = Distrust in Clearwater -- A special report.; Death of a Scientologist Heightens Suspicions in a Florida Town| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9E07E2DE1F3AF932A35751C1A961958260| publisher = [[New York Times]]| date = 1997-12-01| accessdate = 2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Livingness Repair Rundown===
Also known as "Life Repair". According to ''What is Scientology?'' (1978 edition), "This is a brand new Rundown to be used by the [[Scientology Missions International|Missions]] of the Church of Scientology in the handling of new public. This Rundown isolates and addresses the major area the individual has run up against in life that is causing him difficulty, and handles it through a specially formulated program exactly tailored to the individual's need." &lt;ref&gt;''What is Scientology?'' (1978 hardcover edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary Rundown===
The Primary Rundown "consists of word clearing and [[Study Tech]]. It makes a student Super-Literate." It involves clearing (looking up in a dictionary and using in sentences) words encountered in past studies that were not understood. Additionally, one clears the more than 2000 words found on the Study Tapes and Student Hat course.&lt;ref&gt;''What is Scientology?'' (1998 softcover edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

===PTS Rundown===
The PTS ("[[Ethics (Scientology)#Antisocial Personalities|Potential Trouble Source]]") rundown is administered to Scientologists who have been designated PTS and must be assessed for [[Suppressive Person]] status. It is also for Scientologists (especially Sea Org members) who have fallen ill. It is a fundamental Scientology tenet that people with physical illnesses are PTS and/or  "out-Ethics", meaning it is  a "holding back" of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warrior.xenu.ca/1997-0930.html|title=Ex-scientologists speak -- "Warrior"|author=|date=|website=warrior.xenu.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:: "All sick persons are PTS." - Hubbard, HCOB 20 April 1972

:: "...all illness in greater or lesser degree and all foul-ups stem directly and only from a PTS condition." and "...getting rid of that condition requires three basic actions: A. Discover. B. Handle or [[disconnection|disconnect]]." - Hubbard, HCOB 10 August 1973

===Purification Rundown===
{{Main|Purification Rundown}}
The Purification Rundown is a detoxification program involving the use of saunas, vitamins, and consuming oils,  in excess of what accredited medicine considers safe levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Narconon/detox.htm|title=Narconon Exposed: Is Narconon Safe? - Dangerous detoxification|author=|date=|website=www.cs.cmu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South African Rundown===
In Hubbard's words, "This rundown is for delivery to South Africans — those who reside in [[South Africa]] as well as those who have emigrated to other parts of the world. The South African Rundown has two parts: a. PTS handling; b. Help Processes." &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard Communications Office Bulletin (HCOB) of October 21, 1973, "The South African Rundown"&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard explaining his reasoning for a ''South African Rundown'', "The South African native is probably the one impossible person to train in the entire world - he is probably impossible by any human standard." &lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard, Professional Auditor's Bulletin No. 119, 1 September 1957, "The Big Auditing Problem,"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/29/015.html|title=MAJ: South Africa's Psychiatric 'Slave' Labor Camps|author=|date=|website=www.hartford-hwp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Super Power Rundown===
{{main|Super Power Building}}
Described in the ''Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary'' as "a super fantastic, but confidential series of rundowns that can be done on anybody whether un Clear or not that puts the person into fantastic shape unleashing Super Power of a thetan. This means that puts Scientologists into a new realm of ability enabling them to create a new world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solitarytrees.net/pickets/spb1.htm|title=Piękną być z lipolizą iniekcyjną? Kraków z ciekawą opcją|first=Super|last=User|date=|website=www.solitarytrees.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Super Power Building]] in [[Clearwater, Florida]] was built for the specific purpose of administering this rundown.

According to Dan Koon, a former Scientologist, true information about the Super Power Rundown can be found in a document created by Hubbard himself in 1978, called the “Bright Think Rundown,” which describes how someone must “disassociate” from the past while “getting back into the current time frame.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/scientologys-super-power-rundown-what-is-it-anyway-6700611|title=Scientology’s “Super Power Rundown:” What is it, Anyway?|author=|date=|website=villagevoice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vital Information Rundown===
The purpose of this rundown is to increase a person's ability and willingness to relay information. This is important for those who brief, instruct, train, or supervise others.&lt;ref&gt;L Ron Hubbard - HCOB 6 October 1974 The Vital Information Rundown...&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wants Handled Rundown===
A rundown in which the preclear assesses what he wants to get rid of in his life. According to the ''Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary'', "Handling of each thing the pc wants handled is dictated by what the "thing" (somatic, intention, terminal, condition, doingness) is." &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard Communications Office Bulletin (HCOB) of March 28, 1974, "Expanded Dianetics Developments Since the Original Lectures"&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Shinji Shūmeikai was founded by [[Mihoko Koyama]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="nyt-reif"/&gt; She founded the organization to spread the teachings of [[Mokichi Okada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Melikian |first=Souren |title=A Splendid Art Collection Goes On Display in Japan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/06/style/06iht-museum.t.html |accessdate=13 August 2010 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=6 November 1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115085728/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/06/style/06iht-museum.t.html |archivedate=January 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head organization is currently based near [[Shigaraki, Shiga|Shigaraki]], [[Shiga prefecture|Shiga]], Japan.

== Influence and architecture ==
The [[Miho Museum]] was commissioned by Mihoko Koyama, who was an adherent of Okada.&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker|first=Kenneth |title=Miho Lets Art Speak For Itself|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-11-18/entertainment/17270344_1_10th-anniversary-pedestrian-tunnel-objects|accessdate=13 August 2010|newspaper=San Francisco Gate|date=18 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architect [[I.

:''For people named Siddiq, see [[Siddiq (name)]]''
'''Siddiq''' ({{lang-ar|صدیق}} {{IPA-ar|ˈsˤɪd.diːq|pron}}; from the Arabic word meaning "truthful") is an [[Islamic term]] and is given as an [[honorific]] [[title]] to certain individuals.  The feminine gender for Siddiq is '''Siddiqah'''.  The word is sometimes used as a title given to individuals by [[Muhammad]], according to Islamic sources. Otherwise, it is used to denote that the person is totally trustworthy.

==Sunni usage==
[[Sunni]] Muslims use '''as-Siddiq''' as an epithet for [[Abu Bakr]], the first [[Caliph]] of Islam and the closest friend of Muhammad, while they use '''Siddiqah''' for [[Aisha]], Abu Bakr's daughter and the Prophet's wife.

==Sufi term==
In [[Sufi]]sm, Siddiq is a rank that comes after prophet. It is generally given to a person who verified the claim of prophethood in its early stage.  Sufis believe the following four ranks are free of time and space and therefore life and death becomes meaningless to them. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kashmirreader.com/2018/03/05/abu-bakr-siddiqra-the-truthful-i/|title=Abu Bakr Siddiq(RA): The Truthful -I|publisher=Kashmir Reader|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Prophets of Islam|Nabi]] – Prophet, someone who learned of the unseen from God directly
#Siddiq – Early day Muslim who learned the unseen from Muhammad
#[[Shahid (martyr)|Shaheed]] – Martyr, someone who gave their life for the will of God and has thus become beyond mortality.
#Salih – Righteous, someone who spends every bit of their life per the will of God and thus achieved the status of "[[Baqaa]]" through ''[[Fanaa (Sufism)|Fanaa]]''.  Also referred to as [[Wali]].
These four ranks are mentioned in the [[Quran]].

==Shia usage==
[[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] Muslims use '''Siddiqah''' as a title for Muhammed's daughter [[Fatimah Zahra|Fatima]]. In ''[[Then I was Guided (book)|Then I was Guided]]'', the [[Shi'a]] author asks its Sunni audience how it is possible for both [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Fatimah]] to be "Siddiq", when contemplating their intense and deep conflicts, implying that logic demands one to be a liar, and arguing it can not be Muhammed's daughter [http://www.al-islam.org/guided/22.html#2]. The Sunni view is that their conflict was a pure misunderstanding, not blemishing their trustworthiness.

== Other usage ==
In [[Hebrew]] the word/name "[[Tzadik]]" (צדיק), has a similar meaning. The title of [[Voltaire]]'s satirical novella ''[[Zadig]]'' also stems from this name root.

'''Sonari''' is the archaeological site of an ancient monastic complex of [[Buddhist]] [[stupa]]s. The site, positioned on a hill, is located about 10km southwest of [[Sanchi]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]].&lt;ref name = "ASI"&gt; [http://www.asibhopal.nic.in/monument/raisen_Sonari_buddhistacentland.html ASI Sonari page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The stupas were excavated around 1850 by [[Alexander Cunningham]], who discovered two boxes containing relics.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/other/019wdz000000546u00003a00.html British Library Online] &lt;/ref&gt; One of the reliquaries, which is very ornate, is visible nowadays at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].

The reliquary of Stupa No.2 presents has inscriptions in [[Brahmi]] mentioning the names of Buddhist monks also appearing in the reliquary of [[Sanchi Stupa No.2]] and [[Andher Stupas]]: Kasapagota, Majjhima, Kosikiputa, Gotiputa, and Apagira.&lt;ref name = "BA"&gt; Huu Phuoc's Buddhist Architecture The [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA148 p.148] &lt;/ref&gt; It would seem, then, that the ashes of these monks were divided between these three stupas.

The date of construction of Stupa 1 and Stupa 2 must therefore be equivalent to those of [[Sanchi Stupa No.2]], i.e. 125-100 BCE.&lt;Ref name = "BA"/&gt;

There are in all four groups of stupas surrounding Sanchi within a radius of twenty kilometers: Bhojpur and Andher to the southeast, Sonari to the southwest, and Satdhara in the west. &lt;ref name ="BC"&gt; Buddhist Circuit in Central India: Sanchi, Satdhara, Sonari, Andher, Travel ... [https://books.google.fr/books?id=TOrKExVXXpkC&amp;pg=PT3&amp; p31 &lt;/ref&gt; Further south, about 100 km away, is [[Saru Maru]].

Alexander Cunningham and FC Maisey searched Sonari's Stupa No.2 in 1851. The stupa contained three miniature reliquaries, two in soapstone and one in rock crystal, as well as a certain amount of bone ash and a piece of wood. The main reliquary is shaped to resemble a [[Lotus (plant)|lotus]] bud, with incised petals decorating the lower half of the reliquary. It was turned on a [[lathe]] and then carved in [[bas-relief]] with lotus petal strips on the shoulder and lower body, while on the upper body is a large area divided into eight rectangular compartments in each of which are an elephant, horse, deer or winged lion, patterns typical of the period of the [[Maurya Empire]]. These discoveries were published by A Cunningham in ''The Bhilsa Topes'' in 1854.&lt;ref name = "VA"&gt; Notice from [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] [https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O25176/reliquary-unknown/] &lt;/ref&gt;

It had been customary since the death of the Buddha to preserve and venerate his relics. Under emperor [[Ashoka]] (around 268-233 BCE), converted to Buddhism and energetic protector of the faith, a series of stupas, mounds of relics, were erected throughout the empire, marking sites important in the life of the Buddha. This practice continued, and this container of relics was buried around 200 BCE. Relic deposits of this period usually represented original deposits of the relics of the Buddha.&lt;ref name = "VA"/&gt;

[[File:Bihari Sándor Önarckép.jpg|thumb|200px|Self-portrait (1880s?)]]
'''Sándor Bihari''' (19 May 1855, [[Rézbánya]] - 28 March 1906, [[Budapest]]) was a [[Jewish]] Hungarian [[Genre art|genre]] painter.

== Life ==
Born to a [[Jewish]] family, Sándor spent his childhood in [[Nagyvárad]]. Originally, he worked with his father as a decorative painter. In 1874, he moved to Budapest, where he did [[photo manipulation|retouching]] at a photography studio while attending a drawing school operated by [[Bertalan Székely]].&lt;ref name="M"&gt;[http://www.mke.hu/lyka/05/353-365-bihari.htm Béla Fónagy: Bihari Sándor] @ Művészet (from 1906)&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he used his meager resources on a move to Vienna, where he hoped to enroll in the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]]. At first he had to find work as a retoucher again and might have remained in that position, had he not received a gift of 600 [[Forint]]s from Székely, which enabled him to quit his job and enter the Academy.&lt;ref name="M" /&gt;

He returned to his hometown, where he spent three years struggling as a portrait painter until a benefactor who liked his work provided the means for him to study in Paris. He travelled there in 1883, where he studied at the [[Académie Julian]] with [[Jean-Paul Laurens]]&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; and improved his technique by copying the [[Old Masters]] at the [[Louvre]]. While there, he became acquainted with [[plein-air]] painting and [[Impressionism (art)|Impressionism]], which had a decisive influence on his style. Upon returning to Hungary, he settled in [[Szolnok]], a popular gathering place for painters, and would later become one of the founders of an art colony there.

He continued to travel, making lengthy visits to Italy especially, until his health began to fail in 1893.&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; During his final years, he lived in Budapest but continued to spend his summers in Szolnok. In 1896, he was awarded the [[Order of Franz Joseph]].

The '''Temple of Satet''' or '''Satis''' was an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian temple|temple]] dedicated to the [[ancient Egyptian deities|goddess]] [[Satet]], a personification of the [[Nile]] inundation. The temple was located on the Nile Valley island of [[Elephantine]], [[Egypt]]. Founded during the late [[Prehistoric Egypt|Predynastic Period]] around 3200 BC, it was enlarged and renovated several times from the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] onwards over the next 3000 years until the [[Ptolemaic kingdom|Ptolemaic Period]]. The temple of Satet is the best example of an [[Ancient Egyptian temple]] whose construction is attested over the entire pharaonic period.

==Earliest times to first intermediate period==
The earliest temple was built c. 3200 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seidlmayer|first=Stephan|chapter=Aswan|editor1-first=Kathryn|editor1-last=Bard|editor2-first=Steven Blake|editor2-last=Shubert|title=Encyclopedia of the Archeology of Ancient Egypt|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|pp=335–336|isbn=978-0-41-518589-9|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was little more than a cultic niche lodged between three large natural [[granite]] boulders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gundlach|first=Rolf|chapter=Temples|editor-last=Redford|editor-first=Donald B.|editor-link=Donald B. Redford|year=2001|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt, Volume 3|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510234-5|pp=370|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This earliest temple was very small, housing a sanctuary of about {{convert|2|x|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} that was made of mud bricks. In front of the sanctuary, on the East side, there were some mud brick houses. The temple was enlarged during the 1st and 2nd Dynasties&lt;ref&gt;Seidlmayer, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; and rebuilt during the [[Third Dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]], but its old plan was kept. On the South side outside the niche between the boulders, some granaries were added. The temple was again rebuilt during the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]], possibly under [[Nyuserre Ini]], at which point the sanctuary located at the center of the rock niche was enlarged. In front of it was now a forecourt, about {{convert|5|x|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in size, which was surrounded by an open walkway. A deposit of votive offerings was discovered under the floor of the sanctuary. These were dedicated to the goddess over a few hundred years during the course of the [[Old Kingdom]] by both royal and private individuals and comprised mainly small [[Egyptian faience|faience]] figures, showing humans and animals. Beyond that, on the South side, granaries and a mud brick administrative building were located. 

[[Pepi I]], the second pharaoh of the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] oredered once more a rebuilding of the temple. The old plan was kept, but the brick walls were enlarged &lt;ref name=gd&gt;Günter Dreyer: ''Der Tempel der Satet, Elephantine VIII'', Mainz am Rhein {{ISBN|380530501-X}}, 11-23&lt;/ref&gt; and a granite sanctuary for the goddess' statue was added.&lt;ref name=Seidlmayer337&gt;Seidlmayer, p.337&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the god [[Khnum]] was also worshipped in the temple.

==Middle Kingdom==
[[File:Assuan Elephantine Satistempel Sesostris I. 02.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Modern reconstruction of the temple of Senusret I.]]
Towards the end of the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First intermediate period]], in the early [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]], the [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] king [[Intef III]] totally renovated the temple. The central chapel was left at its original place between the three natural boulders. The hall which stood in front of the chapel was paved and decorated with limestone slabs for the first time.&lt;ref name=gd/&gt;

Shortly after, [[Mentuhotep II]] did further modifications in the temple, building an entirely new sanctuary.&lt;ref name=Seidlmayer337/&gt; He added new inscriptions and, on the North side, a columned courtyard and a lake part of an installation to celebrate the Nile flood, which the Ancient Egyptians believed, started in [[Elephantine]]. The temple was then still mainly made out of mud bricks, with only the most important walls lined with decorated limestone blocks.

Less than 100 years later, early in the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|subsequent dynasty]], pharaoh [[Senusret I]] replaced Mentuhotep's structure with a totally new temple and courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;Seidlmayer, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; While all earlier building follow the same layout and exclusively used mud bricks, the new temple was entirely made in limestone. By this time, the level of the temple was above the rock niche of the Old Kingdom. However, the main sanctuary was built directly over the old one, therefore keeping the old tradition. The temple of Senusret I was fully decorated, but only few fragments of the decoration survived, these include the remains of a long inscription of the king. At the same time, the god Khnum was given his own separate temple on the island. The temple of Satet was originally adorned with many statues, among which is a [[Bust of Amenemhat V|statue]] of the [[Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Thirteenth Dynasty]] king [[Sekhemkare|Amenemhat V]] that bears a dedication to the goddess:
{{bquote|The good god, lord of the two lands, lord of the ceremonies, the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Sekhemkare, the son of Ra Amenemhat, beloved of Satet, lady of Elephantine, may he live for ever.}} 

Another statue once adorning the temple belongs to king [[Senusret III]]. There is also a dyad of king [[Sobekemsaf I]] adoring the goddess that was certainly once in the temple. Indeed, even though these statues were all discovered in the nearby sanctuary of the local saint [[Heqaib]], according to their inscriptions they must originally have been in the temple of Satet.&lt;ref&gt;Labib Habachi: ''The Sanctuary of Heqaib'', Elephantine IV, Mainz am Rhein 1985, {{ISBN|380530496X}}, p. 113, no. 102; 116, no. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Kingdom and later times==
[[File:Assuan Elephantine Satistempel 02.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Modern reconstruction of the 18th Dynasty temple of Satet.]]
During the [[New Kingdom]] period, the temple was built anew under queen [[Hatshepsut]] (1507–1458 BC) in the early [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] and further enlarged by her successor, [[Thutmose III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipińska|first=Jadwiga|chapter=Thutmose III|editor-last=Redford|editor-first=Donald B.|editor-link=Donald B.

Kaiser, G. Dreyer, P. Grossmann, W. Mayer, S. Seidlmayer: ''Stadt und Temple von Elephantine, Achter Grabungsbericht'', in ''Mitteilungen des deutschen archäologischen Instituts, Kairo'' 36 (1980), 254-264&lt;/ref&gt; The sanctuary of the new temple was placed directly over the sanctuary of the older periods. Evidently the New Kingdom temple kept the old tradition of the sanctuary's place. There are indications for further construction work during the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|26th Dynasty]] (664–525 BC), but very little of that temple has survived. There are  several blocks of a gateway that was once about {{convert|7.35|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, that led to a brick enclosure wall, the latter perhaps once belonging to the temple. Shortly before the Persian conquest of Egypt, pharaoh [[Amasis II]] (570–526 BC) added a colonnade or kiosk to the temple. Six limestone columns and screen walls were found.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Arnold: ''Temples of the last Pharaohs'', New York, Oxford 1999, {{ISBN|0195126335}}, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seidlmayer, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

A totally new temple was built under [[Ptolemy VI]] (180–145 BC), during the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]. It was again a rectangular building. At the back on the West side, there was the main sanctuary, in front of it there was a broad hall and in front of the latter two further smaller halls, with smaller rooms leading from them on the short sides. In front of the new temple was erected a free standing kiosk. The sanctuary was no longer built over the place of the Old Kingdom sanctuary. It seems that the location and its importance were forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Assmann: ''Ägypten, Theologie und Frömmigkeit einer frühen Hochkultur'', Stuttgart, Berlin, Cologne 1991, {{ISBN|3170117688}}, 48-49&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy VIII]] (182–116 BC) finally added a pronaos to the temple with two by four columns.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold: ''Temples of the last Pharaohs'', p. 189, 202&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Bridge to Total Freedom''', or simply "The Bridge", is a metaphor used by the [[Church of Scientology]] to describe believers' advancement within the religion.

Scientology holds that believers advance to a state of [[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]] when they have freed themselves from the "[[reactive mind]]". This takes place in [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]], and is said to be a lifetime commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashcraft |first1=W. Michael |title=Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations |volume=5 |editor-last=Gallagher |editor-first=Eugene V. |editor2-last=Ashcraft |editor2-first=W. Michael |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2006 |isbn=9780275987176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the church, by reaching Clear status, followers are more self-confident, happy, and generally successful in careers and interpersonal relationships. Beyond the state of Clear, Scientologists move through several auditing steps called [[Operating Thetan]] (OT) levels. An OT is a state of spiritual awareness in which an individual is able to control self and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Semuels|first=Alana|title=Bridge to Total Freedom a lifetime commitment|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05205/542900.stm|accessdate=12 July 2011|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=24 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to D. R. Christensen, Scientology is "an individualistic religion with a hierarchical organization of the soteriological system, called the Bridge". The Bridge is described by the church as a series of [[Soteriology|soteriological]] steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Christensen |first1= Dorthe Refslund |title=Scientology |chapter=Scientology and Self-Narrativity: Theology and Soteriology as Resource and Strategy |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=MtW90YkkB3gC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=scientology&amp;ots=01Zxc5kCXm&amp;sig=aXHPXYVcaOFg4E5ksN8hN17kzwE#v=onepage&amp;q=scientology&amp;f=false |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |accessdate=2016-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bridge is broken down into two parallel paths, Training and Processing. Processing addresses the Scientologist's "case" or how they function in life as influenced by their "aberrations". The Training path teaches Hubbard's theories on the nature of life and the universe and the techniques of [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]]. Participants feel that this knowledge greatly enhances their ability to be effective in life whether they audit another or not.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Scientologists can travel up either side of the Bridge and many do both sides. Although not part of the formal Bridge, the chart also lists many optional courses and training actions that can be done by Scientologists.

The Bridge was a result of the culmination of the foundational work on Dianetics and Scientology training that Hubbard had established in the mid-1960s. In 1965, Hubbard published The Bridge to Freedom, which includes the “Classification and Gradation Chart,” which, according to [[new religious movement]] specialist [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]], discusses the steps that church members must follow as they learn and study Scientology. The chart was a summary of the results of Hubbard’s experimentation since the Hubbard Dianetics Research Foundation was founded fifteen years before that time. Save for adjustments and addendums over several years, it delineated the program for reaching Clear status and becoming an Operating Thetan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=James R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=MtW90YkkB3gC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=scientology&amp;ots=01Zxd9pKWk&amp;sig=NHxEdB5pOVlMRVNX74Kl8UQnKI4#v=onepage&amp;q=scientology&amp;f=false |title=Scientology |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |accessdate=2016-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientologists believe that if an individual is unable to ascend through the Bridge in this lifetime, he or she can continue the journey up the Bridge in another life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Scientology: Religious Studies Approaches |journal=Numen |year=2016 |last=Lewis |first=James R. |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=6–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Forbidden Team(film)''''' ({{lang-da|Det forbudte landshold}}) is a 2003 [[Denmark|Danish]] documentary film directed by [[Rasmus Dinesen]] and [[Arnold Krøjgaard]]. The leading cast consists of [[association football]] trainers [[Jens Espensen]] and [[Michael Nybrandt]], the [[Tibet national football team]] and at the conclusion the [[Greenland national football team]]. Star-part is being played by the [[14th Dalai Lama]].

The film was rewarded as the Best Feature Film on the Krasnogorski International Filmfestival in [[Moscow]], Special Mention on the FID in [[Marseilles]] and the Audience Award on the International Sport Movies &amp; TV Festival in [[Milan]]. The final match against Greenland was broadcast live by the radio station [[Free Tibet]].

==Plot==
The documentary film was shot at the preamble to the football international match of June 30, 2000, between [[Tibet]] and [[Greenland]]. For the [[Tibetan diaspora|Tibetans in exile]] this was the first international match after many decades since the former national team had broke up.

The film starts from the moment of the first training sessions in [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]] in northern [[India]] and ends with the last whistle of the match in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. The match was won by Greenland with 4-1.

The Tibetan Buddhist background of the players is notable in the game mentality of the players who don't show any aggression. This invokes scenes of the trainer. He believes in discipline, hard working and a strong winners mentality.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBME7AXXilw&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tili''' is [[Hindu]] [[caste]], found in the state of [[Bihar]] and [[West Bengal]] in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Bihar Volume XVI  Part Two edited by S Gopal &amp; Hetukar Jha pages 940 to 944 Seagull Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==

The Tili caste belongs to West Bengal and Bihar.Tilis speak in Angika (Regional language of the then Ang Pradesh in Mahabharata) and [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. Tilis are now found mainly in [[Bhagalpur and Banka District]] and also in major parts of West Bengal .&lt;ref&gt;People of India Bihar Volume XVI  Part Two edited by S Gopal &amp; Hetukar Jha pages 940 to 944 Seagull Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The Tilis have two sub-divisions, the Kashyap and the Sandil. They maintain the custom of clan exogamy. The Tilis are cultivators, and have customs similar to other neighbouring [[Hindu]] communities such as the [[Yadav caste|Yadav]], Kurmi and Sadgop. However in late 1990s, this caste is being linked with Kurmi specially in Bihar because of their main dependency on agriculture and allied activities same as Kurmi. This association is still not widely known but association is being strengthened due to frequent marriage treating themselves as a sub-caste of Kurmi. Like many other [[Hindu]] communities, they have their own caste association, the Tili Samaj, which acts as a welfare association for the community.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Bihar Volume XVI  Part Two edited by S Gopal &amp; Hetukar Jha pages 940 to 944 Seagull Books&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tobacco''' is a product prepared from the leaves of the tobacco plant by [[curing of tobacco|curing]] them. The plant is part of the genus ''[[Nicotiana]]'' and of the [[Solanaceae]] (nightshade) family. While [[Nicotiana#Species|more than 70 species]] of tobacco are known, the chief commercial crop is [[Nicotiana tabacum|''N. tabacum'']]. The more potent variant [[Nicotiana rustica|''N. rustica'']] is also used around the world.

Tobacco contains the [[alkaloid]] [[nicotine]], which is a [[stimulant]], and [[harmala alkaloid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rudgley|first1=Richard|title=Tobacco: from The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances|url=https://www.biopsychiatry.com/tobacco/|website=Biopsychiatry|publisher=Little, Brown and Company (1998)|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] in [[cigarette]]s, [[cigar]]s, [[pipe smoking|pipe tobacco]], and flavored [[Mu'assel|shisha tobacco]]. They can also be consumed as [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]], [[chewing tobacco]], [[dipping tobacco]] and [[snus]].

Tobacco use is a risk factor for many diseases, especially those affecting the [[heart]], [[liver]], and [[lungs]], as well as [[Health effects of tobacco#Cancer|many cancers]]. In 2008, the [[World Health Organization]] named tobacco as the world's single greatest preventable cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/mpower_report_forward_summary_2008.pdf|title=WHO Report on the global tobacco epidemic, 2008 (foreword and summary)|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|year=2008|format=PDF|page=8|quote=Tobacco is the single most preventable cause of death in the world today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The English word "''tobacco''" originates from the Spanish and Portuguese word "{{not a typo|''tabaco''}}". The precise origin of this word is disputed, but it is generally thought to have derived at least in part, from [[Taíno language|Taino]], the [[Arawakan]] language of the [[Caribbean]]. In Taino, it was said to mean either a roll of tobacco leaves (according to [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], 1552) or to ''tabago'', a kind of Y-shaped pipe used for sniffing tobacco smoke (according to Oviedo; with the leaves themselves being referred to as ''cohiba'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wais.stanford.edu/Cuba/cuba_ColumbusDiscoversCuba(110503).html|title=World Association of International Studies, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ernst"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ernst|first1=A.|title=On the etymology of the word tobacco|journal=The American Anthropologist|date=1889|volume=A2|issue=2|pages=133–142|doi=10.1525/aa.1889.2.2.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, perhaps coincidentally, similar words in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian were used from 1410 to define medicinal [[herb]]s believed to have originated from the Arabic {{lang|ar|طُبّاق}} ''ṭubbāq'' (also {{lang|ar|طُباق}} ''ṭubāq''), a word reportedly dating to the 9th century, as a name for various herbs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ejtaal.net/aa/#hw4=h660,ll=1916,ls=5,la=2636,sg=645,ha=438,pr=97,vi=240,mgf=549,mr=381,mn=839,aan=360,kz=1457,ulq=1133,uqa=265,uqw=990,umr=652,ums=546,umj=489,uqq=210,bdw=549,amr=392,asb=593,auh=947,dhq=338,mht=549,msb=147,tla=68,amj=481,ens=1,mis=1311 Lane's Lexicon]. page 1879.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The word ''ṭubāq'' no longer refers to various herbs, but has come to refer, in some dialects, specifically to tobacco. ''See'' [http://ejtaal.net/aa/#hw4=660,ll=h1913,ls=h5,la=h2636,sg=h645,ha=h438,pr=h97,vi=h240,mgf=h549,mr=h381,mn=h839,aan=h360,kz=h1457,ulq=h1133,uqa=h265,uqw=h990,umr=h652,ums=h546,umj=h489,uqq=h210,bdw=550,amr=392,asb=593,auh=947,dhq=338,mht=549,msb=147,tla=68,amj=481,ens=1,mis=1311 Hans Wehr's Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]. page 647.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional use===

[[File:Rajput (Jodhpur) (8411728143).jpg|thumb|An [[Indian people|Indian]] man smoking ''Tobacco'' on [[hookah]], [[Rajasthan, India]].]]
Tobacco has long been used in the Americas, with some cultivation sites in Mexico dating back to 1400–1000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Jordan. ''Tobacco in History and Culture: An Encyclopedia'' (Detroit: Thomson Gale, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Many Native American tribes have traditionally grown and used tobacco. Eastern North American tribes historically carried tobacco in pouches as a readily accepted trade item, as well as smoking it, both socially and [[Ceremonial pipe|ceremonially]], such as to seal a peace treaty or trade agreement.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Heckewelder, ''History, Manners and Customs of the Indian Nations who Once Inhabited Pennsylvania'', p. 149 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"They smoke with excessive eagerness&amp;nbsp;... men, women, girls and boys, all find their keenest pleasure in this way." - Dièreville describing the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], ''circa'' 1699 in ''Port Royal''.&lt;/ref&gt; In some populations, tobacco is seen as a gift from the [[Creator deity|Creator]], with the ceremonial tobacco smoke carrying one's thoughts and prayers to the Creator.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Jacob Gottsegen, ''Tobacco: A Study of Its Consumption in the United States'', 1940, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popularization===
[[File:A Smoking Club.jpeg|thumb|An illustration from [[Frederick William Fairholt]]'s ''Tobacco, its History and Association'', 1859]]
[[File:KITLV - 26868 - Kleingrothe, C.J. - Medan - Tobacco plant and tobacco leaf, Deli - circa 1905.tif|thumb|Tobacco plant and tobacco leaf from the [[Deli Company|Deli plantations]] in Sumatra, 1905]]
Following the arrival of the Europeans to the Americas, tobacco became increasingly popular as a trade item. [[Hernández de Boncalo]], Spanish chronicler of the Indies, was the first European to bring tobacco seeds to the [[Old World]] in 1559 following orders of King [[Philip II of Spain]]. These seeds were planted in the outskirts of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], more specifically in an area known as "Los Cigarrales" named after the continuous plagues of cicadas (''cigarras'' in Spanish). Before the development of the lighter Virginia and white burley strains of tobacco, the smoke was too harsh to be inhaled. Small quantities were smoked at a time, using a pipe like the ''[[midwakh]]'' or ''[[kiseru]]'' or smoking newly invented waterpipes such as the [[bong]] or the [[hookah]] (see [[Nicotiana rustica#Thuốc lào|thuốc lào]] for a modern continuance of this practice). Tobacco became so popular that the English colony of Jamestown used it as currency and began exporting it as a cash crop; tobacco is often credited as being the export that saved Virginia from ruin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Relentless Revolution: A History of Capitalism|last=Appleby|first=Joyce|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alleged benefits of tobacco also account for its considerable success. The astronomer [[Thomas Harriot]], who accompanied [[Sir Richard Grenville]] on his 1585 expedition to [[Roanoke Island]], explains that the plant "openeth all the pores and passages of the body" so that the natives’ "bodies are notably preserved in health, and know not many grievous diseases, wherewithal we in England are often times afflicted." &lt;ref&gt;Harriot, Thomas, A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia, 1590, http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4247/4247-h/4247-h.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Tobacco smoking, chewing, and snuffing became a major industry in Europe and its colonies by 1700.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Burns, ''The Smoke of the Gods: A Social History of Tobacco'' (2006), A popular history focused on the US.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jordan Goodman, ''Tobacco in History: The Cultures of Dependence'' (1993), A scholarly history worldwide.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tobacco has been a major [[cash crop]] in Cuba and in other parts of the Caribbean since the 18th century. Cuban cigars are world-famous.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Cosner, ''The Golden Leaf: How Tobacco Shaped Cuba and the Atlantic World'' (Vanderbilt University Press; 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, cigarettes became popular. [[James Bonsack]] created a machine that automated cigarette production. This increase in production allowed tremendous growth in the [[tobacco industry]] until the health revelations of the late-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Kluger, ''Ashes to Ashes: America's Hundred-Year Cigarette War'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan Brandt, ''The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product That Defined America'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
{{See also|Tobacco control|Tobacco in the United States}}
Following the scientific revelations of the mid-20th century, tobacco became condemned as a health hazard, and eventually became encompassed as a cause for cancer, as well as other respiratory and circulatory diseases. In the United States, this led to the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]], which settled the lawsuit in exchange for a combination of yearly payments to the states and voluntary restrictions on advertising and marketing of tobacco products.

In the 1970s, [[Brown &amp; Williamson]] cross-bred a strain of tobacco to produce [[Y1 (tobacco)|Y1]]. This strain of tobacco contained an unusually high amount of nicotine, nearly doubling its content from 3.2-3.5% to 6.5%. In the 1990s, this prompted the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to use this strain as evidence that [[tobacco industry|tobacco companies]] were intentionally manipulating the nicotine content of [[cigarette]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In 2003, in response to growth of tobacco use in developing countries, the World Health Organization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/fctc/en/index.html|title=WHO &amp;#124; WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC)|publisher=Who.int|date=|accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; successfully rallied 168 countries to sign the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The convention is designed to push for effective legislation and its enforcement in all countries to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco. This led to the development of tobacco cessation products.

===''Nicotiana''===
{{Main|Nicotiana}}
{{See also|List of tobacco diseases}}
[[File:Nicotine-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|[[Nicotine]] is the compound responsible for the addictive nature of tobacco use.]]
[[File:Native American tobacco flower.jpg|thumb|upright|Tobacco (''[[Nicotiana rustica]]'') flower, leaves, and buds]]
Many species of tobacco are in the genus of herbs ''Nicotiana''. It is part of the nightshade [[family (biology)|family]] ([[Solanaceae]]) indigenous to [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], [[Australia]], south west [[Africa]], and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Albert|title=Tobacco in New Guinea|journal=The American Anthropologist|date=1931|volume=33|issue=1|pages=134–139|doi=10.1525/aa.1931.33.1.02a00290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most nightshades contain varying amounts of [[nicotine]], a powerful [[neurotoxin]] to [[insect]]s. However, tobaccos tend to contain a much higher concentration of nicotine than the others. Unlike many other Solanaceae species, they do not contain [[tropane alkaloid]]s, which are often poisonous to humans and other animals.

Despite containing enough nicotine and other compounds such as [[germacrene]] and [[anabasine]] and other [[piperidine]] alkaloids (varying between species) to deter most [[herbivore]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Panter |first=KE |last2=Keeler |first2=RF |last3=Bunch |first3=TD |last4=Callan |first4=RJ |year=1990 |title=Congenital skeletal malformations and cleft palate induced in goats by ingestion of Lupinus, Conium and Nicotiana species  |journal=Toxicon |pages=1377–1385 |volume=28 |issue=12 |pmid=2089736}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of such animals have [[evolution|evolve]]d the ability to feed on ''Nicotiana'' species without being harmed. Nonetheless, tobacco is unpalatable to many species due to its other attributes. For example, although the [[cabbage looper]] is a generalist pest, tobacco's gummosis and trichomes can harm early larvae survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elsey|first=K.

===Types===
{{Main|Types of tobacco}}

The types of tobacco include:

* [[Types of tobacco#Aromatic Fire-cured|Aromatic fire-cured]] is cured by smoke from open fires. In the United States, it is grown in northern middle Tennessee, central Kentucky, and [[Virginia]]. Fire-cured tobacco grown in [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]] is used in some chewing tobaccos, moist snuff, some cigarettes, and as a condiment in pipe tobacco blends. Another fire-cured tobacco is [[Latakia (tobacco)|Latakia]], which is produced from oriental varieties of ''N. tabacum''. The leaves are cured and smoked over smoldering fires of local hardwoods and aromatic shrubs in [[Cyprus]] and [[Syria]].
* [[Types of tobacco#Brightleaf tobacco|Brightleaf tobacco]] is commonly known as "Virginia tobacco", often regardless of the state where it is planted. Prior to the [[American Civil War]], most tobacco grown in the US was fire-cured dark-leaf. Sometime after the [[War of 1812]], demand for a milder, lighter, more aromatic tobacco arose. [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Maryland]] all innovated with milder varieties of the tobacco plant. Farmers discovered that Bright leaf tobacco needs thin, starved soil, and those who could not grow other crops found that they could grow tobacco. Confederate soldiers traded it with each other and Union soldiers, and developed quite a taste for it. At the end of the war, the soldiers went home and a national market had developed for the local crop.
* [[Burley (tobacco)|Burley tobacco]] is an air-cured tobacco used primarily for [[cigarette]] production. In the U.S., burley tobacco plants are started from pelletized seeds placed in polystyrene trays floated on a bed of fertilized water in March or April.
* [[Cavendish tobacco|Cavendish]] is more a process of curing and a method of cutting tobacco than a type. The processing and the cut are used to bring out the natural sweet taste in the tobacco. Cavendish can be produced from any tobacco type, but is usually one of, or a blend of Kentucky, Virginia, and burley, and is most commonly used for pipe tobacco and cigars.
* [[Criollo tobacco]] is primarily used in the making of [[cigar]]s. It was, by most accounts, one of the original [[Cuba]]n tobaccos that emerged around the time of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]].
* [[Dokha]] is a tobacco originally grown in [[Iran]], mixed with leaves, bark, and herbs for smoking in a ''[[midwakh]]''.
* [[Turkish tobacco]] is a sun-cured, highly aromatic, small-leafed variety (''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]'') grown in [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. Originally grown in regions historically part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], it is also known as "oriental". Many of the early brands of cigarettes were made mostly or entirely of Turkish tobacco; today, its main use is in blends of pipe and especially cigarette tobacco (a typical American cigarette is a blend of bright Virginia, burley, and Turkish).
* [[Perique]] was developed in 1824 through the technique of pressure-fermentation of local tobacco by a farmer, Pierre Chenet. Considered the [[truffle]] of [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe]] tobaccos, it is used as a component in many blended pipe tobaccos, but is too strong to be smoked pure. At one time, the freshly moist Perique was also chewed, but none is now sold for this purpose. It is typically blended with pure Virginia to lend spice, strength, and coolness to the blend.
* [[Types of tobacco#Shade tobacco|Shade tobacco]] is cultivated in [[Connecticut]] and [[Massachusetts]]. Early Connecticut [[colonist]]s acquired from the Native Americans the habit of smoking tobacco in pipes, and began cultivating the plant commercially, though the [[Puritans]] referred to it as the "evil weed". The [[Connecticut shade tobacco|Connecticut shade]] industry has weathered some major [[Disaster|catastrophes]], including a devastating [[hail]]storm in 1929, and an epidemic of brown spot fungus in 2000, but is now in danger of disappearing altogether, given the increase in the value of land.
* [[Types of tobacco#White Burley|White burley]] air-cured leaf was found to be more mild than other types of tobacco. In 1865, George Webb of [[Brown County, Ohio]] planted red [[Burley (tobacco)|burley]] seeds he had purchased, and found a few of the seedlings had a whitish, sickly look, which became white burley.
* [[Types of tobacco#Wild Tobacco|Wild tobacco]] is native to the southwestern United States, [[Mexico]], and parts of [[South America]]. Its botanical name is ''Nicotiana rustica''.
* [[Y1 (tobacco)|Y1]] is a strain of tobacco [[cross-breeding|cross-bred]] by [[Brown &amp; Williamson]] in the 1970s to obtain an unusually high [[nicotine]] content. In the 1990s, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] used it as evidence that [[tobacco industry|tobacco companies]] were intentionally manipulating the nicotine content of [[cigarette]]s.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/settlement/interviews/kessler.html|title=Inside the Tobacco Deal - interview with David Kessler|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|year=2008|accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultivation===
{{Main|Cultivation of tobacco}}
[[File:Nicotiana Tobacco Plants 1909px.jpg|thumb|upright|Tobacco plants growing in a field in [[Intercourse, Pennsylvania|Intercourse]], [[Pennsylvania]].]]

Tobacco is cultivated similarly to other agricultural products. [[Seed]]s were at first quickly scattered onto the soil. However, young plants came under increasing attack from [[flea beetle]]s (''Epitrix cucumeris'' or ''E. pubescens''), which caused destruction of half the tobacco crops in United States in 1876. By 1890, successful experiments were conducted that placed the plant in a frame covered by thin cotton fabric. Today, tobacco is sown in [[cold frame]]s or hotbeds, as their [[germination]] is activated by light.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In the United States, tobacco is often fertilized with the mineral [[apatite]], which partially starves the plant of [[Biological role of nitrogen|nitrogen]], to produce a more desired flavor.

After the plants are about {{convert| 8| inch|cm}}  tall, they are transplanted into the fields. Farmers used to have to wait for rainy weather to plant. A hole is created in the tilled earth with a tobacco peg, either a curved wooden tool or deer antler. After making two holes to the right and left, the planter would move forward two feet, select plants from his/her bag, and repeat. Various mechanical tobacco planters like Bemis, New Idea Setter, and New Holland Transplanter were invented in the late 19th and 20th centuries to automate the process: making the hole, watering it, guiding the plant in — all in one motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=van Willigen|first1=John|last2=Eastwood|first2=Susan|title=Tobacco Culture: Farming Kentucky's Burley Belt|date=2015|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=9780813148083|page=91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIkfBgAAQBAJ&amp;dq|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tobacco is cultivated annually, and can be [[harvest]]ed in several ways. In the oldest method still used today, the entire plant is harvested at once by cutting off the stalk at the ground with a tobacco knife. It is then speared onto sticks, four to six plants a stick and hung in a curing barn. In the 19th century, bright tobacco began to be harvested by pulling individual leaves off the stalk as they ripened. The leaves ripen from the ground upwards, so a field of tobacco harvested in this manner involves the serial harvest of a number of "primings", beginning with the [[volado]] leaves near the ground, working to the [[seco (tobacco)|seco]] leaves in the middle of the plant, and finishing with the potent [[ligero]] leaves at the top. Before this, the crop must be topped when the pink flowers develop. Topping always refers to the removal of the tobacco flower before the leaves are systematically removed, and eventually, entirely harvested. As the industrial revolution took hold, harvesting wagons used to transport leaves were equipped with man-powered stringers, an apparatus that used twine to attach leaves to a pole. In modern times, large fields are harvested mechanically, although topping the flower and in some cases the plucking of immature leaves is still done by hand. Most tobacco in the U.S. is grown in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/research/factsheets/pdf/0125.pdf | title = Tobacco-growing states in the USA|publisher = Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curing===
{{Main|Curing of tobacco}}
[[File:Tobacco barn.JPG|thumb|Tobacco barn in [[Simsbury, Connecticut]] used for air curing of shade tobacco]]
[[File:Tobacco drying iran.jpg|thumb|Sun-cured tobacco, [[Bastam]], [[Iran]]]]

Curing and subsequent aging allow for the slow [[oxidation]] and degradation of [[carotenoid]]s in tobacco leaf. This produces certain compounds in the tobacco leaves, and gives a sweet hay, [[tea]], [[rose oil]], or fruity aromatic flavor that contributes to the "smoothness" of the smoke. Starch is converted to sugar, which [[glycation|glycates]] protein, and is oxidized into [[advanced glycation endproduct]]s (AGEs), a [[caramelization]] process that also adds flavor. Inhalation of these AGEs in tobacco smoke contributes to [[atherosclerosis]] and [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cerami C, Founds H, Nicholl I, Mitsuhashi T, Giordano D, Vanpatten S, Lee A, Al-Abed Y, Vlassara H, Bucala R, Cerami A |title=Tobacco smoke is a source of toxic reactive glycation products|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=94|issue=25|year=1997|pages=13915–20|doi=10.1073/pnas.94.25.13915|pmid=9391127|pmc=28407|bibcode=1997PNAS...9413915C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of AGEs are dependent on the curing method used.

Tobacco can be cured through several methods, including:

* '''[[Curing of tobacco#Air|Air-cured]]''' tobacco is hung in well-ventilated barns and allowed to dry over a period of four to eight weeks. Air-cured tobacco is low in sugar, which gives the tobacco smoke a light, mild flavor, and high in nicotine. Cigar and burley tobaccos are 'dark' air-cured.&lt;ref&gt;"tobacco curing." The Hutchinson Unabridged Encyclopedia with Atlas and Weather guide. Abington: Helicon, 2010. Credo Reference. Web. 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Curing of tobacco#Fire|Fire-cured]]''' tobacco is hung in large barns where fires of hardwoods are kept on continuous or intermittent low smoulder, and takes between three days and ten weeks, depending on the process and the tobacco. Fire curing produces a tobacco low in sugar and high in nicotine. Pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, and snuff are fire-cured.
* '''[[Curing of tobacco#Flue|Flue-cured]]''' tobacco was originally strung onto tobacco sticks, which were hung from tier-poles in curing barns (Aus: [[kiln]]s, also traditionally called 'oasts'). These barns have flues run from externally fed fire boxes, heat-curing the tobacco without exposing it to smoke, slowly raising the temperature over the course of the curing. The process generally takes about a week. This method produces cigarette tobacco that is high in sugar and has medium to high levels of nicotine. Most cigarettes incorporate flue-cured tobacco, which produces a milder, more inhalable smoke.
* '''[[Curing of tobacco#Sun|Sun-cured]]''' tobacco dries uncovered in the sun. This method is used in Turkey, Greece, and other Mediterranean countries to produce oriental tobacco. Sun-cured tobacco is low in sugar and nicotine and is used in cigarettes.

Some tobaccos go through a second stage of curing, known as ''[[Fermentation (food)|fermenting]]'' or ''sweating''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tobacco Leaf Harvesting, Curing, and Fermenting|url=https://www.leafonly.com/tobacco-harvesting-curing-fermenting.php|website=Leaf Only|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cavendish Tobacco|Cavendish]] undergoes fermentation pressed in a ''casing'' solution containing sugar and/or flavoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pipe Tobacco|url=http://www.tobacconistuniversity.org/tobacco-college/pipe-special-types2.asp |accessdate=April 20, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017001708/http://www.tobacconistuniversity.org/tobacco-college/pipe-special-types2.asp |archivedate=October 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global production===

====Trends====
[[File:Preparando o tabaco em Balibó.jpg|thumb|Tobacco production in [[Portuguese Timor]] in the 1930s]]

Production of tobacco leaf increased by 40% between 1971, when 4.2 million tons of leaf were produced, and 1997, when 5.9 million tons of leaf were produced.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2010"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. "Projection of tobacco production, consumption and trade for the year 2010." Rome, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Food and Agriculture organization of the UN, tobacco leaf production was expected to hit 7.1 million tons by 2010. This number is a bit lower than the record-high production of 1992, when 7.5 million tons of leaf were produced.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2004"&gt;The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.''Higher World Tobacco use expected by 2010-growth rates slowing down." (Rome, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The production growth was almost entirely due to increased productivity by developing nations, where production increased by 128%.&lt;ref name="JhaChaloupka2000"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Prabhat Jha|editor2=Frank J.

China's share of the world market increased from 17% in 1971 to 47% in 1997.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2010"/&gt; This growth can be partially explained by the existence of a high import tariff on foreign tobacco entering China. While this tariff has been reduced from 64% in 1999 to 10% in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hu | first1 = T-W | last2 = Mao | first2 = Z | display-authors = 2 | last3 = et al | year = 2006 | title = China at the Crossroads: The Economics of Tobacco and Health | url = | journal = Tobacco Control | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = i37–i41 | doi=10.1136/tc.2005.014621| pmc = 2563551 | pmid=16723674}}&lt;/ref&gt; it still has led to local, Chinese cigarettes being preferred over foreign cigarettes because of their lower cost.

Every year, about 6.7 million tons of tobacco are produced throughout the world. The top producers of tobacco are China (39.6%), India (8.3%), Brazil (7.0%) and the United States (4.6%).&lt;ref&gt;US Census Bureau-Foreign Trade Statistics, (Washington DC; 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====China=====
Around the peak of global tobacco production, 20 million rural Chinese households were producing tobacco on 2.1 million hectares of land.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. "Issues in the Global Tobacco Economy."&lt;/ref&gt; While it is the major crop for millions of Chinese farmers, growing tobacco is not as profitable as cotton or sugarcane, because the Chinese government sets the market price. While this price is guaranteed, it is lower than the natural market price, because of the lack of market risk. To further control tobacco in their borders, China founded a [[State Tobacco Monopoly Administration]] (STMA) in 1982. The STMA controls tobacco production, marketing, imports, and exports, and contributes 12% to the nation's national income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/english/2005-10/03/content_74295.htm |title=People's Republic of China. "''State Tobacco Monopoly Administration'' |publisher=Gov.cn |date=2005-09-15 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted above, despite the income generated for the state by profits from state-owned tobacco companies and the taxes paid by companies and retailers, China's government has acted to reduce tobacco use.&lt;ref&gt;USC U.S.-China Institute, "Talking Points, February 3–17, 2010: http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=1992&lt;/ref&gt;

=====India=====
[[India]]'s Tobacco Board is headquartered in [[Guntur]] in the state of [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tobaccoboard.com/ |title=Tobacco Board, Guntur |publisher=Tobaccoboard.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has 96,865 registered tobacco farmers&lt;ref name="Shoba 2002"&gt;Shoba, John and Shailesh Vaite. Tobacco and Poverty: Observations from India and Bangladesh. Canada, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and many more who are not registered. In 2010, 3,120 tobacco product manufacturing facilities were operating in all of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://india.anythingresearch.com/Tobacco-Product-Manufacturing.html|title=Tobacco Manufacturing in India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 0.25% of India's cultivated land is used for tobacco production.&lt;ref&gt;3.Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. "Issues in the Global Tobacco Economy."&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1947, the [[Indian government]] has supported growth in the tobacco industry. India has seven tobacco research centers, located in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Bihar]], [[Mysore]], and [[West Bengal]] houses the core research institute.

=====Brazil=====
In Brazil, around 135,000 family farmers cite tobacco production as their main economic activity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Tobacco has never exceeded 0.7% of the country's total cultivated area.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=International Tobacco Growers' Association|title=Tobacco farming: sustainable alternatives? Volume 2|date=n.d.|publisher=ITGA|location=East Sussex|isbn=978-1872854021|url=http://www.tobaccoleaf.org/UserFiles/file/Why_Grow_Tobacco/tobacco_farming.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the southern regions of Brazil, Virginia, and Amarelinho, flue-cured tobacco, as well as burley and Galpão Comum air-cured tobacco, are produced. These types of tobacco are used for cigarettes. In the northeast, darker, air- and sun-cured tobacco is grown. These types of tobacco are used for cigars, twists, and dark cigarettes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
Brazil's government has made attempts to reduce the production of tobacco, but has not had a successful systematic antitobacco farming initiative. Brazil's government, however, provides small loans for family farms, including those that grow tobacco, through the ''Programa Nacional de Fortalecimento da Agricultura Familiar''.&lt;ref&gt;High Level Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor. "Report from South America." 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems in production===

====Child labor====
{{main|Child labor}}
The International Labour Office reported that the most child-laborers work in agriculture, which is one of the most hazardous types of work.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;ILO. International Hazard Datasheets on Occupations: Field Crop Worker&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2017|talk=Child labor and failed verification}} The tobacco industry houses some of these working children. Use of children is widespread on farms in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Malawi, and Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, The State of the World's Children 1997 (Oxford, 1997); US Department of Agriculture By the Sweat and Toil of Children Volume II: The Use of Child Labor in US Agricultural Imports &amp; Forced and Bonded Child Labor (Washington, 1995); ILO Bitter Harvest: Child Labour in Agriculture (Geneva, 1997); ILO Child Labour on Commercial Agriculture in Africa (Geneva 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; While some of these children work with their families on small, family-owned farms, others work on large plantations.
In late 2009, reports were released by the London-based human-rights group [[Plan International]], claiming that child labor was common on Malawi (producer of 1.8% of the world's tobacco&lt;ref name="United Nations 2010"/&gt;) tobacco farms. The organization interviewed 44 teens, who worked full-time on farms during the 2007-8 growing season. The child-laborers complained of low pay and long hours, as well as physical and sexual abuse by their supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;Plan International. ''Malawi Child Tobacco Pickers' '50-a-day habit'' http://plan-international.org/about-plan/resources/media-centre/press-releases/malawi-child-tobacco-pickers-50-a-day-habit/?searchterm=tobacco&lt;/ref&gt; They also reported suffering from [[Green tobacco sickness]], a form of nicotine poisoning. When wet leaves are handled, nicotine from the leaves gets absorbed in the skin and causes nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Children were exposed to 50-cigarettes-worth of nicotine through direct contact with tobacco leaves. This level of nicotine in children can permanently alter brain structure and function.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2017|talk=Child labor and failed verification}}

====Economy====
[[File:MRO Cuba Harvest 01.jpg|thumb|Tobacco harvesting, [[Viñales Valley]], Cuba]]
Major tobacco companies have encouraged global tobacco production. [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]], [[British American Tobacco]], and [[Japan Tobacco]] each own or lease tobacco-manufacturing facilities in at least 50 countries and buy crude tobacco leaf from at least 12 more countries.&lt;ref&gt;"International Cigarette Manufacturers," Tobacco Reporter, March 2001&lt;/ref&gt; This encouragement, along with government subsidies, has led to a glut in the tobacco market. This surplus has resulted in lower prices, which are devastating to small-scale tobacco farmers. According to the World Bank, between 1985 and 2000, the inflation-adjusted price of tobacco dropped 37%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Golden Leaf, Barren Harvest: The Costs of Tobacco Farming |url=http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_330.pdf |author=The Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids |date=November 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406112907/http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_330.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco is the most widely [[smuggling|smuggled]] legal product.&lt;ref name=ICLJTU&gt;{{cite news|title=Tobacco Underground|url=http://www.icij.org/project/tobacco-underground|accessdate=November 26, 2012|newspaper=The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environment====
Tobacco production requires the use of large amounts of [[pesticide]]s. Tobacco companies recommend up to 16 separate applications of pesticides just in the period between planting the seeds in greenhouses and transplanting the young plants to the field.&lt;ref name="Taylor, Peter 1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Peter|title=Smoke Ring: The Politics of Tobacco|publisher=Panos Briefing Paper|location=London|date=September 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pesticide use has been worsened by the desire to produce larger crops in less time because of the decreasing market value of tobacco. Pesticides often harm tobacco farmers because they are unaware of the health effects and the proper safety protocol for working with pesticides. These pesticides, as well as fertilizers, end up in the soil, waterways, and the food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=FAO Yearbook, Production, Volume 48|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coupled with child labor, pesticides pose an even greater threat. Early exposure to pesticides may increase a child's lifelong cancer risk, as well as harm his or her nervous and immune systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children|year=1995|publisher=National Academy Press|author=National Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tobacco crops extract nutrients (such as [[phosphorus]], [[nitrogen]], and [[potassium]]) from soil, decreasing its fertility.&lt;ref name=wwf.panda&gt;{{cite web|title=Tobacco Free Initiative: Environmental issues|url=http://www.who.int/tobacco/research/economics/rationale/environment/en/|author=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the wood used to cure tobacco in some places leads to deforestation. While some big tobacco producers such as China and the United States have access to petroleum, coal, and natural gas, which can be used as alternatives to wood, most developing countries still rely on wood in the curing process.&lt;ref name="wwf.panda"/&gt; Brazil alone uses the wood of 60 million trees per year for curing, packaging, and rolling cigarettes.&lt;ref name="Taylor, Peter 1994"/&gt;

In 2017 WHO released a study on the environmental effects of tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/tobacco/publications/environmental-impact-overview/en/ Tobacco and its environmental impact: an overview] World Health Organization, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
Several tobacco plants have been used as [[model organism]]s in [[genetics]]. [[Tobacco BY-2 cells]], derived from ''N. tabacum'' [[cultivar]] 'Bright Yellow-2', are among the most important research tools in plant [[cell biology|cytology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ganapathi TR |display-authors=etal | year = 2004 | title = Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) – A model system for tissue culture interventions and genetic engineering | url = http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/7722/1/IJBT%203(2)%20171-184.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Indian Journal of Biotechnology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 171–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco has played a pioneering role in [[Callus (cell biology)|callus]] culture research and the elucidation of the mechanism by which [[kinetin]] works, laying the groundwork for modern agricultural [[biotechnology]].

===Genetic modification===
Because of its importance as a research tool, transgenic tobacco was the first GM crop to be tested in field trials, in the United States and France in 1986; China became the first country in the world to approve commercial planting of a GM crop in 1993, which was tobacco.&lt;ref name="James 1996"&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Clive|title=Global Review of the Field Testing and Commercialization of Transgenic Plants: 1986 to 1995|url=http://www.isaaa.org/kc/Publications/pdfs/isaaabriefs/Briefs%201.pdf|publisher=The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications|accessdate=17 July 2010|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Field trials====
Many varieties of transgenic tobacco have been intensively tested in field trials. Agronomic traits such as resistance to pathogens (viruses, particularly to the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV); fungi; bacteria and nematodes); weed management via herbicide tolerance; resistance against insect pests; resistance to drought and cold; and production of useful products such as pharmaceuticals; and use of GM plants for [[bioremediation]], have all been tested in over 400 field trials using tobacco.&lt;ref name=GMOCompass&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/database/plants/304.tobacco.html |title=Tobacco |publisher=GMO Compass |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002090217/http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/database/plants/304.tobacco.html |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Production====
Currently, only the US is producing GM tobacco.&lt;ref name="James 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name=GMOCompass /&gt; The Chinese virus-resistant tobacco was withdrawn from the market in China in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Conner AJ, Glare TR, Nap JP | date = Jan 2003 | title = The release of genetically modified crops into the environment.

==Consumption==
{{Further|Tobacco products}}

Tobacco is consumed in many forms and through a number of different methods. Some examples are:

* '''[[Beedi]]''' are thin, often flavoured cigarettes from India made of tobacco wrapped in a [[Diospyros melanoxylon|tendu]] leaf, and secured with coloured thread at one end.
* '''[[Chewing tobacco]]''' is the oldest way of consuming tobacco leaves. It is consumed orally, in two forms: through sweetened strands, or in a shredded form. When consuming the long, sweetened strands, the tobacco is lightly chewed and compacted into a ball. When consuming the shredded tobacco, small amounts are placed at the bottom lip, between the gum and the teeth, where it is gently compacted, thus it can often be called dipping tobacco. Both methods stimulate the salivary glands, which led to the development of the [[spittoon]].
* '''[[Cigar]]s''' are tightly rolled bundles of dried and fermented tobacco, which are ignited so their smoke may be drawn into the smokers' mouths.
* '''[[Cigarette]]s''' are a product consumed through inhalation of smoke and manufactured from cured and finely cut tobacco leaves and reconstituted tobacco, often combined with other additives, then rolled into a paper cylinder.
* '''[[Creamy snuff]]''' is tobacco paste, consisting of tobacco, clove oil, glycerin, spearmint, menthol, and camphor, and sold in a toothpaste tube. It is marketed mainly to women in India, and is known by the brand names Ipco (made by Asha Industries), Denobac, Tona, and Ganesh. It is locally known as ''mishri'' in some parts of Maharashtra.
* '''[[Dipping tobacco]]s''' are a form of [[smokeless tobacco]]. Dip is occasionally referred to as "chew", and because of this, it is commonly confused with [[chewing tobacco]], which encompasses a wider range of products. A small clump of dip is 'pinched' out of the tin and placed between the lower or upper lip and gums. Some brands, as with snus, are portioned in small, porous pouches for less mess.
* '''[[Gutka]]''' is a preparation of crushed betel nut, tobacco, and sweet or savory flavorings. It is manufactured in India and exported to a few other countries. A mild stimulant, it is sold across India in small, individual-sized packets.
* '''[[Heat-not-burn tobacco product]]s''' heat rather than burn tobacco to generate an aerosol that contains nicotine.
* '''[[Dokha]]''' is a middle eastern tobacco with high nicotine levels grown in parts of Oman and Hatta, which is smoked through a thin pipe called a medwakh. It is a form of tobacco which is dried up and ground and contains little to no additives excluding spices, fruits, or flowers to enhance smell and flavor.
* '''[[Hookah]]''' is a single- or multistemmed (often glass-based) water pipe for smoking. Hookahs were first used in India and Persia;&lt;ref&gt;American Lung Association. February 2007 [http://www.lungusa2.org/embargo/slati/Trendalert_Waterpipes.pdf An Emerging Deadly Trend: Waterpipe Tobacco Use]&lt;/ref&gt; the hookah has gained immense popularity, especially in the Middle East. A hookah operates by water filtration and indirect heat. It can be used for smoking herbal fruits or [[moassel]], a mixture of tobacco, flavouring, and [[honey]] or [[glycerin]].
* '''[[Kreteks]]''' are cigarettes made with a complex blend of tobacco, cloves, and a flavoring "sauce". They were first introduced in the 1880s in Kudus, Java, to deliver the medicinal [[eugenol]] of cloves to the lungs.
* '''[[Roll-your-own]]''', often called 'rollies' or 'roll-ups', are relatively popular in some European countries. These are prepared from loose tobacco, cigarette papers, and filters all bought separately. They are usually cheaper to make.
* A '''[[Smoking pipe (tobacco)|tobacco pipe]]''' typically consists of a small chamber (the bowl) for the combustion of the tobacco to be smoked and a thin stem (shank) that ends in a mouthpiece (the bit). Shredded pieces of tobacco are placed into the chamber and ignited.
* '''[[Snuff (tobacco)|Snuff]]''' is a ground smokeless tobacco product, inhaled or "snuffed" through the nose. If referring specifically to the orally consumed moist snuff, see [[dipping tobacco]].
* '''[[Snus]]''' is a steam-pasteurized moist powdered tobacco product that is not fermented, and induces minimal salivation. It is consumed by placing it (loose or in little pouches) against the upper gums for an extended period of time. It is somewhat similar to dipping tobacco but does not require spitting and is significantly lower in [[Tobacco-specific nitrosamines|TSNA]]s.
* '''[[Tobacco edibles]]''', often in the form of an infusion or a spice, have gained popularity in recent years.
* '''[[Tobacco products#Topical tobacco paste|Topical tobacco paste]]''' is sometimes used as a treatment for [[wasp]], [[hornet]], [[fire ant]], [[scorpion]], and [[bee sting]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.caes.uga.edu/caespubs/pubcd/c782-w.html Beverly Sparks, "Stinging and Biting Pests of People"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214061028/http://pubs.caes.uga.edu/caespubs/pubcd/c782-w.html |date=2007-02-14 }} Extension Entomologist of the University of Georgia College of Agricultural &amp; Environmental Sciences Cooperative Extension Service.&lt;/ref&gt; An amount equivalent to the contents of a cigarette is mashed in a cup with about a half a teaspoon of water to make a paste that is then applied to the affected area.
* '''[[Tobacco water]]''' is a traditional [[organic farming|organic]] [[insecticide]] used in domestic [[gardening]]. Tobacco dust can be used similarly. It is produced by boiling strong tobacco in water, or by steeping the tobacco in water for a longer period. When cooled, the mixture can be applied as a spray, or 'painted' on to the leaves of garden plants, where it kills insects. Tobacco is, however, banned from use as pesticide in certified organic production by the USDA's [[National Organic Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omri.org/simple-gml-search/results?page=18 |title=Generic Materials Search &amp;#124; Organic Materials Review Institute |publisher=Omri.org |date= |accessdate=2014-10-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723072126/http://www.omri.org/simple-gml-search/results?page=18 |archivedate=2015-07-23 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

===Social===
Smoking in public was, for a long time, reserved for men, and when done by women was sometimes associated with [[promiscuity]]; in Japan, during the [[Edo period]], prostitutes and their clients often approached one another under the guise of offering a smoke. The same was true in 19th-century Europe.&lt;ref name="Screech-Smoke"&gt;Timon Screech, "Tobacco in Edo Period Japan" in ''Smoke'', pp. 92-99&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[American Civil War]], the use of tobacco, primarily in cigars, became associated with [[masculinity]] and power. Today, tobacco use is often stigmatized; this has spawned quitting associations and antismoking campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Durkin Sarah |author2=Brennan Emily |author3=Wakefield Melanie | year = 2012 | title = Mass media campaigns to promote smoking cessation among adults: an integrative review | url = http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/tobaccocontrol/21/2/127.full.pdf| journal = Tobacco Control | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 127–138 | doi=10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2011-050345|pmid=22345235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mullin Sandra | year = 2011 | title = Global anti-smoking campaigns urgently needed | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 378 | issue = 9795| pages = 970–971 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(11)61058-1 | pmid=21741699}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bhutan]] is the only country in the world where tobacco sales are illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2112449/ The First Nonsmoking Nation], [[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its propensity for causing detumescence and erectile dysfunction, some studies have described tobacco as an anaphrodisiacal substance.&lt;ref&gt;Verze, Paolo, et al. "The link between cigarette smoking and erectile dysfunction: a systematic review." European urology focus 1.1 (2015): 39-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographic===
{{Main|Prevalence of tobacco consumption}}

Research on tobacco use is limited mainly to smoking, which has been studied more extensively than any other form of consumption.

===Harmful effects of tobacco and smoking===
{{Main|Health effects of tobacco}}
{{See also|List of additives in cigarettes}}
Tobacco smoking poses a risk to health due to the inhalation of poisonous chemicals in tobacco smoke such as [[carbon monoxide]], [[cyanide]], and [[carcinogens]] which have been proven to cause heart and lung diseases and Cancer.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tobacco is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally.&lt;ref name="isbn92-4-159628-7"&gt;{{cite book | author = World Health Organization | title = WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic 2008: The MPOWER Package | edition = | language = | publisher = World Health Organization | location = Geneva | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-92-4-159628-2 | url = http://www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/mpower_report_full_2008.pdf }}page 14&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO estimates that tobacco caused 5.4 million deaths in 2004&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/entity/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GBD_report_2004update_full.pdf |title=WHO global burden of disease report 2008 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 100 million deaths over the course of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=WHO2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/entity/tobacco/mpower/mpower_report_prevalence_data_2008.pdf |title=WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic, 2008 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] describe tobacco use as "the single most important preventable risk to human health in developed countries and an important cause of premature death worldwide."&lt;ref name="fn1"&gt;"[https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/quit_smoking/you_can_quit/nicotine.htm Nicotine: A Powerful Addiction]."

The harms caused by inhalation of poisonous chemicals such as [[carbon monoxide]] in tobacco smoke include diseases affecting the [[heart]] and [[lung]]s, with smoking being a major risk factor for [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[stroke]]s, [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (emphysema), and [[cancer]] (particularly [[lung cancer]], [[Cancer of the larynx|cancers of the larynx and mouth]], and [[pancreatic cancers]]). Cancer is caused by inhaling carcinogenic substances present in tobacco smoke.

Inhaling secondhand tobacco smoke can cause lung cancer in nonsmoking adults. In the United States, about 3,000 adults die each year due to lung cancer from secondhand smoke exposure. Heart disease caused by secondhand smoke kills around 46,000 nonsmokers every year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov/health-effects/secondhand-smoke/index.html Secondhand Smoke] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920231625/http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov/health-effects/secondhand-smoke/index.html |date=2014-09-20 }} by BeTobaccoFree.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

The addictive alkaloid [[nicotine]] is a [[stimulant]], and popularly known as the most characteristic constituent of tobacco.

"Much of the disease burden and premature mortality attributable to tobacco use disproportionately affect the poor", and of the 1.22 billion smokers, 1 billion of them live in developing or transitional economies.&lt;ref name="WHOTobaccoFactSheet" /&gt;

Smoking of tobacco is practised worldwide by over one billion people. However, while smoking prevalence has declined in many developed countries, it remains high in others and is increasing among women and in developing countries. Between one-fifth and two-thirds of men in most populations smoke. Women's smoking rates vary more widely but rarely equal male rates.&lt;ref name="greenfacts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tobacco: Active and Passive Smoking|url=http://www.greenfacts.org/en/tobacco/2-tobacco-smoking/1-smoke-tobacco.htm|website=Greenfacts.org|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, the lowest income group spends 15% of its total expenditures on tobacco. In Egypt, more than 10% of households' expenditure in low-income homes is on tobacco.

The roles of '''women in Daoism''' have differed from the traditional [[Chinese patriarchy|patriarchy]] over [[women in ancient and imperial China]]. Chinese women had special importance in some [[Taoist schools|Daoist schools]] that recognized their [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] abilities to communicate with deities, who frequently granted women with [[revelation|revealed]] texts and scriptures. Women first came to prominence in the [[Shangqing School|Highest Clarity School]], which was founded in the 4th century by a woman, [[Wei Huacun]]. The [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907) was a highpoint for the importance of Daoist women, when one-third of the Shangqing clergy were women, including many aristocratic Daoist nuns. The number of Daoist women decreased until the 12th century when the [[Quanzhen School|Complete Perfection School]], which ordained [[Sun Bu'er]] as the only woman among its original disciples, put women in positions of power. In the 18th and 19th centuries, women Daoists practiced and discussed ''nüdan'' (女丹, "women's ''[[neidan]]'' inner alchemy"), involving gender-specific practices of [[Anapanasati#In the Chinese tradition|breath meditation]] and [[Daoist meditation#Early visualization meditation|visualization]]. Furthermore, Daoist divinities and cults have long traditions in China, for example, the [[Queen Mother of the West]], the patron of ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' immortality, [[He Xiangu]], one of the [[Eight Immortals]], and [[Mazu]], the protectress of sailors and fishermen. 

==Terminology==
Since organized Daoism began in the late [[Han dynasty]] (202 BCE-220 CE), women have been active in different schools, which gave them diverse names. In the [[Way of the Celestial Masters|Tianshi dao]] (Way of the Celestial Masters), they were called ''nüshi'' (女士 or 女師, "female masters") when married to a Master, or ''nüguan'' (女官, "female officers") when among chosen ''zhongmin'' (種民, "seed people"). In the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] (Highest Clarity) School, Daoist nuns were most often solitary practitioners, and called ''nü daoshi'' (女道士, "female Daoists" or "female Daoist masters") or ''nüguan'' (女冠, "female hats", describing a distinctive ritual headdress) in the [[Song dynasty]]. The [[Quanzhen School|Quanzhen]] (Complete Perfection) School uses ''daogu'' (道姑, "ladies of the Dao") in reference to both convent nuns and devout laity (Despeux 2000: 384, 2008: 171). 

==History==
[[File:Shan Hai Jing - Xi Wangmu.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Queen Mother of the West]] illustration in the ''[[Shanhaijing]]'', [[Qing dynasty]] edition.]]
[[File:QueenMotherOfTheWest-Earthenware-EasternHanDynasty-ROM-May8-08.png|thumb|upright|Queen Mother of the West, [[Han dynasty]] earthenware, 2nd century CE]]
===Pre-Han and Han===
Xiwang mu, the [[Queen Mother of the West]], is the most prominent female Daoist divinity, although her traditions predated organized Daoist religions (Despeux 2008: 172). Sources from the [[Warring States period]] (475-221 BCE) associate the Queen Mother with shamanistic traditions, such as her [[Familiar spirit|familiar]] the [[three-legged crow]], and her [[peaches of immortality]] orchard (Despeux 2000: 386). The c. 3rd century BCE ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' (Classic of Mountains and Seas) says, "In appearance, Queen Mother of the West looks like a human, but she has a leopard's tail and the fangs of a tigress, and she is good at [[Transcendental whistling|whistling]]. She wears a victory crown on her tangled hair. She presides over the Catastrophes from the Sky and the Five destructive Forces." (tr. Birrell 2000: 24)

During the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE), people believed that the Queen Mother could protect them from disease and death, and she became the central figure worshiped by a peasant cult that arose in [[Shandong]] and swept through the country in 3 BCE (Despeux and Kohn 2003: 27). Xiwang mu became known as the goddess of epidemics who resided in the west on [[Kunlun (mythology)|Kunlun Mountain]] and ruled over the demons of pestilence. Her cults worshiped the Queen in different regions of China, especially [[Mount Heng (Hunan)|Mount Heng]] in [[Hunan]], [[Mount Hua]] in [[Shaanxi]], and [[Mount Wuyi]] in [[Fujian]].

Under the Six Dynasties, the Queen mother's cult was integrated into the pantheon of [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] (Highest Clarity) Daoism and she became one of the school's key goddesses, helping both sexes at this time. Her worship peaked during the Tang period, when she emerged particularly as the protectress of women, and was revered as the representative of the female ideal (Cahill 1993). Since the Song dynasty, Xiwang mu's cult in official Daoism has been increasingly supplanted by that of other goddesses. She has nevertheless continued to be a major figure in sectarian movements and small congregational groups who received messages from her through ''fuji'' [[Fuji (planchette writing)|spirit writing]]. Descending onto the altar during séances, under the Ming and Qing she took on the title [[Wusheng Laomu]] (無生老母, Unborn Venerable Mother), and still remains a key goddess worshiped by women, especially in popular settings (Despeux 2000: 387).

===Early Middle Ages=== 
Women began to become important in organized Daoism during the [[Three Kingdoms]] and [[Six Dynasties]] (221–590) and [[Sui dynasty]] (590–618) periods. In the 4th century the [[Shangqing School]] recognized a woman, [[Wei Huacun]] (251-334), as the school's founder. Women in this Daoist school transmitted scriptures, taught methods, and served as initiators (Despeux 2008: 171). 

Married to a leading Tianshi officer, Wei Huacun became a respected ''jijiu'' (祭酒, libationer), which means that she received a thorough religious education in the organization, including sexual rites of passage and the reception of official registers (Despeux 2000: 388). Her hagiography says that she attained the Dao on Mount Heng, which at the time was a highly active center of both Buddhist and Daoist practices (Faure 1987). She was accordingly called [[Nanyue District|Nanyue]] furen (南嶽夫人, Lady of the Southern [[Sacred Mountains of China|Marchmount]]). After this time, she became the object of an important cult which, especially under the Tang (Schafer 1977) became prominent among women Daoists and spread throughout China (Strickmann 1979: 142).

According to a Six Dynasties' text, the Tianshi School distinguished five different types of women suited to become Daoist practitioners: young unmarried girls, women unable to marry due to an inauspicious horoscope, women forced into marriage, widows, and rejected wives (Overmyer 1991: 99-101). These were all undesirable classes, rejected by society, to which Tianshi offered a form of escape and an alternative. Such a status allowed these women to have at least some role and not be excluded completely. The same pattern also held true for other Daoist schools and periods, especially during the Tang dynasty (Despeux 2000: 385).

===Tang=== 
[[Image:Spring Outing of the Tang Court.jpg|thumb|right|Spring Excursion of Emperor Xuanzong's Court, by [[Zhang Xuan]] (713–755)]]
The status of women in Daoism reached a peak during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907), particularly in the 8th century, when women formed one-third of the clergy (Despeux 2008: 171). Under the auspices of the Shangqing School, which dominated organized Daoism under the Tang, women reached their most prominent religious positions as initiators, preceptors, and possessors of sacred texts and methods. This was actively supported by [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (r. 712-56), whose "passions for women and Daoism extended to women Daoists". According to the official statistics, there were 1,687 Daoist temples in the 8th century: 1,137 for men and 550 for women. Women thus constituted an important part of the Daoist clergy as it was recognized officially (Despeux 2000: 388).

The rise of aristocratic Daoist nuns during the Tang was an unprecedented development in Chinese society and history. More than ten imperial daughters became ordained Daoists and converted their residences into convents (Schafer 1985: 1). Separated from the Chinese social order through their religious conversion, the women could both maintain their political influence and avoid palace intrigues. They economically benefited from their new status, enjoying a remarkable degree of personal freedom for a Tang woman, often led a licentious life, traveled extensively, and devoted themselves to the arts (Despeux 2000: 388). 

Women would enter Daoist convents for differing reasons, such as girls purifying their lives before entering society or widows seeking a better life. Sometimes a woman would become a Daoist nun in order to escape an unwanted marriage or to change her husband. [[Princess Taiping]], the youngest daughter of [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]] (r. 649-683) and [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]], entered a Daoist convent in 670 to escape a requested [[marriage of state]] with the king of "barbarian" [[Turpan]] (Despeux 2000: 389). [[Yang Guifei]] (Most Honorable Consort Yang), the beloved concubine of Emperor Xuanzong, was married to [[Li Mao]], the emperor's eighteenth son, who she left by becoming a Daoist nun in 745, which then allowed her to enter Xuanzong's [[Imperial Chinese harem system|imperial harem]] (Schafer 1978).

A celebrated example of noble Daoist nuns was the elaborate 711 ordination ceremony of two imperial princesses, Xining (西寧) and Changlong (昌隆), the eighth and ninth daughters of [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang]] (r. 684-90) and sisters of Emperor Xuanzong (Despeux 2008: 172). The Daoist ritualist Zhang Wanfu (張萬福) described the princesses' splendiferous 14-day ordination rite, and noted the widespread criticism from ministers and officials about the high costs (Benn 1991:148-151). The emperor also ordered the construction of two monasteries for his daughter nuns in [[Chang'an]], nearby the imperial concubines (Despeux 2000: 388).

Official Daoism incorporated several female-based cults during the Tang. While local cults had always flourished in the north and northwest of China, they predominantly began in the maritime and central regions of the east and south where divine women, including goddesses, shamanesses, and cultic founders, grew in stature and often became objects of pilgrimages undertaken equally by men and women (Schafer 1973). Daoist texts often described the integration of regional divinities into the official pantheon as conquests, and praised female Daoists for their exceptional powers as prophets, healers, and saviors (Despeux 2000: 390).

The lesser-known [[Taoist schools#Chronology of major schools|Qingwei]] (清微, Pure Subtlety) school, a tradition that emphasized therapy and exorcism, incorporated a local cult founded by the Daoist priestess Zu Shu (祖舒, fl. 889-904) from [[Lingling District|Lingling]] (near present-day [[Yongzhou]], [[Hunan]]) (Despeux 2008: 172). Unlike the well-documented biography of Wei Huacun, little is known about Zu. After receiving ordination in the traditions of Daoist Tianshi, Shangqing, and [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] schools, she went to [[Guiyang County|Guiyang]] (present-day [[Chenzhou]], Hunan) where she met Lingguang shengmu (靈光聖母, Holy Mother of Numinous Radiance), who transmitted to Zu Shu the Way of Pure Subtlety together with talismans and exorcism techniques, said to have been passed down from [[Yuanshi Tianzun]] (Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning) (Despeux 2000: 390). Later Qingwei followers placed Zu at the head of their "patriarchal" lineage, which Chen Cai (陳采) first constructed in the 13th-century ''Qingwei xianpu'' (清微仙普, Account of the Immortals of Pure Subtlety) (Boltz 1987: 38-39). According to Catherine Despeux, Zu Shu seems more like a southern shaman than a religious visionary. Rather than an active founder, she appears in the Pure Subtlety school mainly as a [[preceptor]] who transmitted methods that she learned from another woman (2000: 391).

===Song===

[[File:Changchun-Temple-Master-and-disciples-painting-0316.jpg|thumb|[[Wang Chongyang]] and his seven [[Quanzhen School]] masters, with Sun Bu'er in the middle of the back row]]
In the early [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) the number of women Daoists declined to about 3-5% of the registered clergy and only rose again later, with the emergence of the [[Quanzhen School]] in the late 12th century during the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] (1115–1234). Nevertheless, cults of women continued to flourish and there were some senior female practitioners of various techniques (Despeux 2000: 391).

Among the cults, in addition to the Queen Mother of the West, the Daoist pantheon includes other well-known female divinities. For instance, [[He Xiangu]] (Immortal Maiden He), one of the [[Eight Immortals]], whose cult was established between the Tang and Song dynasties (Despeux 2008: 172). 

The cult of Linshui furen (臨水夫人, the Lady of the Water's Edge), or Chen Jinggu (陳靖姑, 767-791), became popular during the Song era. According to Daoist tradition, she was born with various supernatural abilities, but died young and pregnant during a rain-making ritual. Her powers began to manifest after her death and she gradually grew into the protectress of women, children, and ''[[Tongji (spirit medium)|jitong]]'' (乩童, boy mediums) (Despeux 2008: 172). The cult first developed in Chen's home state of [[Min Kingdom|Min]] ([[Fujian]]), and then was canonized in the Song as Linshui furen. Many practices of this women's movement were shamanistic, Linshui furen and her sisters were praised as magicians, controllers of demons, exorcists, and healers who could undertake shamanic travels into the afterlife. Linshui furen's cult grew and established her more formally as a divinity, and her fame spread more widely (Despeux 2000: 391). Later this Daoist cult became particularly prominent in Taiwan, where the Lady of the Water's Edge served as a focal point for communities of women who refused marriage but did not wish to become celibate, and instead preferred lesbian life (Berthier 1988).

Among female Daoist practitioners, Cao Wenyi (曹文逸, fl. 1119-1125) was a renowned author who was posthumously honored as the first woman to practice ''[[neidan]]'' inner alchemy. Song bibliographies list her writings to include commentaries on various Daoist texts, including the ''[[Xishengjing]]'' (Scripture of Western Ascension) and ''[[Daodejing]]'', and a long poem on ''neidan'' entitled ''Lingyuan dadao ge'' (靈源大道歌, Song of the Great Dao, the Numinous Source) (Despeux 2008: 172). It begins, "I am telling all you ladies straight: The stem of destiny grows from perfect breathing that irradiates the body and provides long life, whether empty or not empty, and brings forth the numinous mirror which contains Heaven and all beings." (tr. Despeux and Kohn 2003: 137). [[Emperor Huizong of Song]] (r. 1100-1125) heard of Cao's fame, called her to the capital [[Kaifeng]], and conferred the title Wenyi zhenren (文逸真人, Perfected One of Literary Withdrawal). In the Qing dynasty, Lady Cao supposedly appeared in spirit-writing séances and was venerated by several lineages of women's inner alchemy﹒ Some of her writings are preserved in the [[White Cloud Temple]] in Beijing, where the Daoist [[Taoist schools#Other schools|Qingjing]] (清靜, Purity and Tranquility) school honors her as their patroness (Despeux 2000: 391-392).

While women were of lesser importance in Daoism through most of the Song, their position rose again with the growth of the Quanzhen School, in which they served as [[abbesses]] of major temples and leaders of local associations. The Quanzhen list of [[Quanzhen School#Branches and sects|seven masters]] includes a woman, [[Sun Bu'er]] (1119-1183). She was born into a powerful local family in [[Ninghai County|Ninghai]] in [[Shandong]], received a literary education, and married [[Quanzhen School#History|Ma Yu]] (馬鈺, 1123-1183) who also became one of the seven masters (Cleary 1989). When the Quanzhen founder [[Wang Chongyang]] visited Ninghai in 1167, Ma Yu and Sun Bu'er became active disciples. She later became a senior leader, ordained as Qjngjing sanren (清靜散人, Serene Lady of Purity and Tranquility), with the right to teach and ordain other woman followers (Despeux 2000: 392).

===Yuan, Ming, and Qing===
[[File:Dinastia ming, sovrano delle nuvole dell'alba (bixia yuanjun), xv secolo ca.jpg|thumb|Bixia yuanjun statue, bronze with traces of pigment, [[Ming dynasty]] 15th century]]
[[File:Een schip op volle zee.jpg|thumb|[[Mazu]]'s miraculous rescue of [[Emperor Huizong of Song]]'s envoy Lu Yundi (路允迪) returning from [[Goryeo]] in 1123]] 
While the cult of Sun Bu'er became increasingly important during the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (1271–1368), [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] (1368–1644) and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] (1644–1912) dynasties, the general prestige of Daoist women decreased. Under the Yuan dynasty, when the [[Mongols]] governed China, there were 20,000 registered Daoists, many of them women, and institutions run by and for women were established throughout the country (Despeux and Kohn 2003: 152). References to women in Daoism become less frequent in the late Yuan and early Ming periods, and hagiographies of women are rare.  The image of women became more complex in Qing sectarianism, which witnessed a revival of the tendency to honor women as matriarchs (Despeux 2008: 172). The Qing rulers instituted the [[Gelug]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] as the [[state religion]], and forced Buddhists and Daoists to use the same institutions. Some Daoist subsects and local groups had lineages that go back to a woman founder. In addition, Qing authors wrote texts specifically dealing with inner alchemy for women (Despeux 2000: 393).

Cults of female deities developed mainly in the southern and coastal regions of [[Anhui]], [[Hunan]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Fujian]], [[Guangxi]], and [[Guangdong]]. Cult sites in these provinces were centers of intense religious activity and pilgrimage sites that attracted both male and female devotees. Beginning in the Tang period, the growth and reputation of the cults depended on their recognition by official Daoist institutions, learned circles, and the imperial court (Despeux 2008: 172).

The Daoist pantheon adopted several popular goddesses. One of them is the Buddhist goddess [[Marici (Buddhism)|Marici]], the personification of light and daughter of the creator god [[Brahma]] who rules destiny (Getty 1962: 132-134). In Daoism, she appears as [[Doumu]] (斗母, Mother of the [[Big Dipper]]) and protectress against violence and peril (Despeux 2000: 393). 

The cult of Bixia yuanjun (碧霞元君, Goddess of the Morning Clouds) began in the Song with the discovery of a statue on [[Mount Tai]], and during the Ming she was venerated as the daughter of [[Mount Tai#Great Deity of Mount Tai|Dongyue dadi]] (東岳大帝, Great Deity of Mount Tai), and merciful helper of dead souls (Naquin 1992: 334-345). As documented in the ''Bixia yuanjun huguo baosheng jing'' (碧霞元君護國保生經, Scripture on the Guarding of Life and Protection of the Country through the Goddess of the Morning Clouds), she was officially integrated into the pantheon through formal empowerment by [[Yuanshi Tianzun]] (Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning), who reportedly gave her the necessary spells and talismans for helping people (Despeux 2000: 393).

The [[water deity]] [[Mazu]] (Ancestral Mother) or Tianfei (天妃, Celestial Consort), the [[tutelary deity|tutelary]] of seafarers and fishermen, is prominent among the emerging new Daoist goddesses, and parallels the Buddhist goddess of compassion [[Guanyin]] who similarly saves mariners. She is the deification of the shamaness Lin Moniang (林默娘, 960-987) a fisherman' s daughter from [[Meizhou Island]] off Fujian. Refusing to marry, she practiced self-cultivation until she was able to command nature in order to protect herself, and then used her powers to rescue her father and brothers whenever they were in danger of drowning. After an early death, her spirit powers increased and she became famous for safeguarding fishermen and traveling merchants (Despeux and Kohn 2003: 65). The Mazu cult began in Fujian at the end of the 10th century, and by the 13th had spread throughout the maritime coastal provinces of Guangdong, [[Zhejiang]], [[Jiangsu]], and [[Anhui]] (Despeux 2008: 172).  In the present day, her cult has spread throughout [[Southeast Asia]] and [[overseas Chinese]] communities, with major Chinese sanctuaries in [[Tianjin]] and [[Quanzhou]], 510 temples in Taiwan, and 40 in Hong Kong (Despeux 2000: 393-394).

==Texts==
Sources on women in Daoism include both collections of biographies of ''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' ("immortals; transcendents"), technically "[[hagiographies]]" insofar as ''xian'' are [[saints]], and works by women authors, particularly about ''neidan'' inner alchemy.

===Hagiographies===
Daoist biographical compilations, dating back to the c. 2nd century CE ''[[Liexian zhuan]]'' and 4th century ''[[Shenxian zhuan]]'', generally include hagiographies of both men and women, but there are two works dealing exclusively with the lives of women in Daoism (Despeux 2008: 173).

The first text is the 913 ''Yongcheng jixian lu'' (墉城集仙錄, Records of the Immortals Gathered in the Walled City), compiled by the Daoist priest and author [[Du Guangting]] (850-933). Du's preface says the original text contained 109 hagiographies of Shangqing masters, but the received text exists in two partial versions, with 37 biographies in the canonical ''[[Daozang]]'' and 28 in the ''[[Yunji Qiqian]]'' anthology, only two of which are identical. Based on the extant fragments of the collection, the majority of Daoist women presented belonged to the Shangqing School during the Tang. In his preface Du Guangting emphasizes that, according to Shangqing teachings, the Primordial Father (Yuanfu 元父) and the Metal Mother Jinmu 金母) are in charge of entering the names of male and female adepts in the heavenly registers of immortality, which are overseen by Xiwangmu, protectress of the immortals of Yongcheng, the Heavenly Walled City on Mount Kunlun. This description does not imply any form of gender hierarchy or preference, but rather shows a complementarity between the two, echoing earlier periods when worship of the Queen Mother was dominant among popular cults (Despeux 2000: 394-395). The 3rd-century ''[[Bowuzhi]]'' (Record of Ample Things) quotes Laozi that, "all people are under the care of the Queen Mother of the West. Only the destinies of kings, sages, men of enlightenment, immortals and men of Dao are cared for by the Lord of the Nine Heavens." (tr. Greatrex 1987: 78).

The second is the ''Houji'' 後集 (Later Compilation) portion of ''Lishi zhenxian tidao tongjian'' (歷世真仙體道通鋻, Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals and Those Who Embodied the Dao through the Ages), compiled by the Yuan hagiographer Zhao Daoyi (趙道一, fl. 1294-1307) of the Quanzhen school. The text contains 120 biographies, including many found in the ''Yongcheng jixian lu'', and combines mythic Daoist deities, such as Laozi's mother Wushang yuanjun (無上元君, All-Highest Goddess), Doumu, and Xiwangmu, with real women, including fourteen biographies of Song women (Despeux 2000: 394-395).
 
===Works written by women=== 
Emperor Xuanzong's younger sister Yuzhen gongzhu (玉真公主, Princess of Jade Perfection) who became a Daoist nun wrote two texts, both dated 738: the ''Qionggong wudi neisi shangfa'' (瓊宮五帝內思上法, Highest Methods of Visualizing the Five Emperors of the Jasper Palace) and ''Lingfei liujia neisi tongling shangfa'' (靈飛六甲內思通靈上法, Highest Methods of Visualizing the Flying Spirits of the Six Jia to Communicate with the Divine). Both describe meditation methods used in the Shangqing school, and her [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] was preserved in a Tang calligraphic collection by [[Zhong Shaojing]].

The 848 ''Huangting neijing wuzang liufu buxie tu'' (黃庭內景五臟六腑補瀉圖, Illustrated Description of the Tonification or Dispersion of the Five Organs and Six Viscera According to the Yellow Court Scripture) was written by the Tang Daoist physiologist Hu Jin (胡惜), said to have been taught by the mythological Sunü (素女, Immaculate Girl) on [[Mount Taibai]] in [[Shaanxi]]. This text contains a discussion of the central organs in the human body, and lists ''neidan'' therapies for internal ailments, including drugs, energy absorptions, dietary restrictions, and gymnastic exercises. They correspond with the meditational techniques from the c. 4th-century ''[[Yellow Court Classic]]'' that were popular during the Tang (Despeux 2000: 396). The illustrations have been long lost, but the book is "full of therapy and pharmacy, throwing valuable light on the borderline between medicine and Taoist physiological alchemy" ([[Joseph Needham|Needham]] and Lu 1983: 82).

Cao Wenyi's 12th-century ''Lingyuan dadao ge'' (靈源大道歌, Song of the Great Dao of the Numinous Source) is also attributed to He Xiangu, the only female of the Eight Immortals. This lengthy [[Chan Buddhism]]- influenced poem does not specifically mention anything female, but Qing Daoists associated its author with women's inner alchemical practices, and the text was accordingly included into collections on the subject (Despeux 2000: 396).

===Works on women's inner alchemy===
A corpus of Daoist literature concerning ''nüdan'' (女丹, women's [inner] alchemy), or ''kundao'' (坤道, "the female way", with ''kun'' "female; 8th of the 8 trigrams, ☷), comprises about thirty documents of unequal length, dating from 1743 to 1892. These texts are generally attributed to both male and female divinities and said to have been transmitted through spirit-writing (Despeux 2008: 173). The few earlier sources that specifically mentioned ''neidan'' practices for women were typically in terms of [[yin and yang]] correlations. Since yin is associated with women and left while yang with men and right, the breath supposedly turns toward the left in men and toward the right in women (Despeux 2000: 406).

The 1834 ''Daozang xubian'' (道藏續編, Supplement to the Daoist Canon), edited by Min Yide (閔一得), contains two consecutive works about women's internal alchemy. First, the ''Xiwang mu nüxiu zhengtu shize'' (西王母女修正途十則, Ten Principles of the Queen Mother of the West on the Correct Path of Female Cultivation, tr. Wile 1992: 193-201) was revealed in 1795 by Sun Bu'er to Li Niwan (李泥丸). The original title was ''Nü jindan jue'' (女金丹訣, Women's Formula of the Golden Elixir). The text shows some [[Chinese Esoteric Buddhism|Tantric Buddhist]] influence, and presents ten rules specifically for women's practice, including techniques on how to intercept menstruation, breast massages, visualization of ''[[qi]]'' [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]] in the body, and breath meditation exercises (Despeux 2000: 397; 2008: 173). Second, the ''Niwan Li zushi nüzong shuangxiu baofa'' (泥丸李祖師女宗雙修寶筏, Precious Raft of Women's Double Cultivation According to Master Li Niwan), subtitled ''Nügong zhinan'' (女功指南, A Compass of Women's Practice), was also revealed to Li in 1795. The text explains nine rules for the progressive transformation of the adept's body, including calming and purifying the spirit, increasing energy circulation through breast massages, eventually leading to the accumulation of wisdom, and formation of a new spiritual "body of light" within the adept's body (Despeux 2000: 397-398).

He Longxiang's (賀龍驤) ''Nüdan hebian'' (女丹合編, Collected Works on Inner Alchemy for Women) was included in the 1906 edition ''Daozang jiyao'' (道藏輯要, Essentials of the Daoist Canon). His preface notes that he spent thirty years collecting and compiling the collection, based on the practices undertaken by the Daoist women in his family. The materials consist of about twenty prose and poetry texts that outline the various major stages of the inner alchemical path, precisely describe the energy meridians, and make clear distinctions between men's and women's practices (Despeux 2000: 398).

The ''Nü jindan fayao'' (女金丹法要, Essential Methods of Women's Golden Elixir), by Fu Jinquan (傅金銓, 1765-1844), mostly consists of poems and prose texts revealed by Sun Bu'er through planchette writing. The author emphasizes the importance of cultivating companionship with others and the necessity of performing virtuous acts. Women adepts are supposed to purify their karma, repent their sins, and cultivate goodness, sincerity, filial piety, and proper wifely devotion (Despeux 2000: 398). Fu Jinquan also compiled ''nüdan'' texts in the early 19th century collection ''Daoshu shiqi zhong'' (道書十七種, Seventeen Books on the Dao) (Despeux 2008: 173). 

The ''Nüzi daojiao congshu'' (女子道教叢書, Collection of Daoist Writings for Women), compiled by Yi Xinying (易心瑩, 1896-1976), contains eleven texts, describing women's liturgy, women's Daoist lineages, the principles of body transmutation, interception of menses, and interior cultivation (Despeux 2000: 398).

Writings on inner alchemy for women emphasize the ''shengtai'' (聖胎, "Sacred Embryo; Immortal Embryo") of sainthood. The process has three stages transforming the [[Neidan#The Three Treasures|Three Treasures]] of ''[[jing (TCM)|jing]]'' ([[Wikt:精|精]], "essence; semen; menstrual fluid"), ''[[qi]]'' ([[Wikt:氣|氣]], "vitality; energy; breath"), and ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' ([[Wikt:神|神]], "spirit; deity; supernatural being"). First, refining the ''jing'' essence and transforming it into ''qi'' energy; second, refining the energy and transforming it into ''shen'' spirit; and third, refining the spirit to return to (''xu'' 虛) emptiness. In the first stage, the adept transforms the various yin and yang forces within the body into an embryo of energy. During the second stage and in the course of ten symbolic [[Chinese calendar#Month|months]], this embryo gives birth to the ''yuanshen'' (元神, original spirit force). This birth takes place through the [[fontanelle]], because the alchemical process inverts the course of natural procedures. This luminous spirit leaves and re-enters the body, and then is further sublimated in the third stage to eventually merge back completely into cosmic emptiness (Despeux 2000: 406).

Only the first stage differentiates practices between men and women. In ''neidan'' terminology, semen is called ''baihu'' (白虎, White Tiger) and menstrual blood is ''chilong'' (赤龍, Red Dragon). Instead of refining seminal essence and transforming it into energy, women refine their menstrual blood by progressively diminishing their flow and eventually stopping it altogether. This is known as ''duan chilong'' (斷赤龍, "cutting off the Red Dragon") or ''zhan chilong'' (斬赤龍, "decapitating the Red Dragon"), and identifies the adept as pregnant with an embryo of pure energy. Menstrual blood is sublimated into a "new blood" called the ''baifeng sui'' (白鳳髓, "white marrow of the phoenix"), which is refined into a higher level of spiritual power (Despeux 2000: 406-407).

In [[traditional Chinese medicine]], menstrual blood and seminal fluid represent the fundamental energies of women and men. The cessation of the menstrual flow in women structurally corresponds with the retention of the semen in men. In both cases, loss of an essential substance is stopped and with it, the loss of original energy. This cessation creates a reversal of the natural processes and allows the symbolic creation of a new internal sprout of energy that turns into an embryo of energy. According to traditional medical literature, menstrual blood is formed from maternal milk, which two days before menstruation, sinks down from the breasts into the uterus where it transforms into blood. The refinement of menstrual blood into energy is therefore a reversal of the natural process and consists of its returning to milky secretions. The process begins with breast massages to stimulate the internal fire of sexual desire, which is then controlled to nurture the inner being. Furthermore, the female adept uses breath meditation to transform menstrual blood back into breast secretions. A warm energy is felt rotating around her navel, the area heats up, and the "red is transformed into the white". According to the ''Nü jindan'', "When yang is close to being transformed into yin and to flow out through the jade channel [vagina], quickly get on the wheel of fire. When the wind of the Xun blows in the upper part, in the original Scarlet Palace [solar plexus], decapitate the periodic flow of blood so that it can never run again!" (Despeux 2000: 407).

Texts on ''neidan'' practices affirm that since the internal movement of energies corresponds to the gestational capabilities already present in women, their spiritual progress with inner alchemy is consequently faster than that of men. While a male adept has to develop a womb inside himself and learn how to nurture an embryo in it, a woman already has this natural faculty and thus has an easier time learning the practice. He Lοngxiang's preface says, "In the case of women, we discuss breathing techniques but not embryonic practices" (Despeux 2000: 402).

===Mediumistic activities===

Women played an important role in the long tradition of [[Chinese shamanism]]. The word ''[[Wu (shaman)|wu]]'' ({{linktext|巫}}, "spirit medium; shaman; sorcerer; doctor") was first recorded during the [[Shang Dynasty]] (ca. 1600–1046 BCE) when a ''wu'' could be either male or female. During the late [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1045-256 BCE) ''wu'' specifically meant "female shaman; sorceress" as opposed to ''xi'' ({{linktext|覡}}, "male shaman; sorcerer"). Later names for shamanesses include ''nüwu'' (女巫, "woman shaman"), ''wunü'' (巫女, "shaman woman"), ''wupo'' (巫婆, "shaman old woman"), and ''wuyu'' (巫嫗, "shaman hag"). Shamans communicated with the divine world, serving as diviners, diagnosticians, healers, exorcists, and ''[[Zhao Hun|zhaohun]]'' summoners of souls (Hawkes 1985). Early Daoist movements assimilated popular shamanistic practices, especially [[Revelation|revealed texts]] and [[automatic writing]], and yet also criticized shamans for heterodox worship and black magic (Despeux 2000: 403). 

Many Daoist texts were thought to have been revealed to mediums and shamans in states of [[Chinese spirit possession|spirit possession]]. An early example is the c. 2nd-century CE ''[[Taipingjing]]'' (Scripture of Great Peace) that describes itself as a ''tianshu'' (天書, "celestial book") (Overmyer and Jordan 1986: 37). The ''[[Zhen'gao]]'', which was allegedly revealed to the mystic [[Yang Xi]] in the 4th century, has strong shamanistic overtones. For instance, "If perfected and divine spirits descend into an impure person of the world, they are no longer acting or writing with their own feet and hands. As above and below are so far distant from each other, how can their traces [writings] be truly visible [to humans]?" (Despeux 2000: 403).

Mediumistic literature enthralled Chinese [[Scholar-official|literati]], and the Song authors [[Shen Kuo]] and [[Su Dongpo]] both described spirit-writing practices, especially those associated with the cult of the Zigu (紫姑, Purple Lady), the [[toilet god|Toilet God]]. In the Tang period, she was the second wife of a man whose jealous first wife brutally mutilated her, and slowly burned her to death in the toilet. Since Zigu died on the fifteenth of the first lunar month, that became her feast day, when she would descend into entranced women followers and answer their questions (Maspero 1981: 135-137). She was venerated as the protectress of women, and even the [[Jiajing Emperor]] (r. 1522-1566) had a special altar to Zigu. 

Women had privileged positions in mediumistic circles and Daoism. Shamanic elements underlie traditions of both schools with female lineages and women's inner alchemical texts. When organized Daoism adapted the ancient practices of shamanesses, women Daoists took on important new roles and functions (Despeux 2000: 403-404). 

===Sexual practices===
The Daoist spectrum of sexual activities ranged widely across schools, some stressed strict celibacy, others mystically married celestial partners, and still others practiced communal ritual intercourse (Despeux 2008: 173). 

In the early Tianshi movement, all community members were initiated into a religious life of strict moral control and ritual sex. Women in the movement played key organizational roles and were essential in the ''guodu'' (過度, "rites of passage") sexual initiation, which went back to ancient ''fangzhong shu'' (房中術, "bedchamber arts") longevity techniques, and to shamans' ecstatic unions with the divine (Wile 1992). Best known is the [[sexual ritual]] of ''heqi'' (合氣, "harmonizing the energies"), during which community members, regardless of their marital affiliations, joined in formal intercourse. The rites took place in the [[Oratory (worship)|oratorγ]] or ''jingshi'' (靜室, "chamber of tranquility") in the presence of a master and an instructor. The techniques involved visualization of bodily energies and ritualized body movements aligned with [[Chinese numerology]] and [[Chinese astrology|astrology]]. In contrast to the sensual bedchamber arts, the ritual sex of Tianshi adepts was believed to result in formation of the Immortal Embryo, which benefits themselves as well as contributed to greater universal harmony (Despeux 2000: 404). [[Daoxuan]]'s 644 ''Guang hongming ji'' (廣弘明集, Expanded Collection on the Propagation and Clarification [of Buddhism]) says, "During the rituals held at new and full moon, Daoists attend on their preceptor in their private chambers. Feeling and intention are made akin, and men and women engage in joining together. They match their four eyes and two noses, above and below. They join their two mouths and two tongues, one with the other. Once then yin and yang have met intimately, essence and energy are exchanged freely. Thus, the rites of men and women are performed and the Dao of male and female is harmonized." (tr. Despeux and Kohn 2003: 106).

The Shangqing Clarity tradition takes an ambivalent position toward sexual practices, while not completely rejected, sexuality is considered a lesser technique unable to grant advanced levels of spiritual realization. This Daoist school contends, along with some other religions of the world, that an adept must practice sexual abstinence and chastity in order to see and hear deities. Although the basic theme of sexual union is preserved, it is transposed into imaginary interactions with the divine (Despeux 2000: 405). As the ''Zhen'gao'' says: "When a perfected appears as a presence of light and one engages with him or her, then this is union with the light, love between two beings of light. Although they are then called husband and wife, they do not engage in marital relations" (tr. Despeux 2000: 399). Shangqing adepts sought to transcend mundane sexual union and move into the invisible realm, through the mediation of celestial partners and divine marriages (Cahill 1992).

Daoist schools of ''neidan'' inner alchemy have two basic views on women and sexual union. First, retaining the semen during intercourse creates psycho-physiological transformations, which benefit both female and male adepts as equal partners. Second, practicing sexual abstinence emphasizes women's mediumistic abilities and results in [[autoeroticism]], such as massaging her breasts. In both cases, the union's goal is the formation of an Immortal Embryo, the first sprout of the adept's spiritual rebirth (Despeux 2000: 405).

Daoist literature describes the ideal sexual union as an even exchange of energies between partners, but some non-Daoist literature mentions a sort of "sexual vampirism" in which one partner selfishly tries to obtain energies at the other's expense. This practice, called ''caizhan'' (採戰, "plucking [of energy] in [amorous] combat"), usually benefited men but sometimes also women. For instance, the Queen Mother of the West attained Daoist immortality by nurturing her yin essence. Legends say that she never had a husband, but liked to copulate with young boys (Wile 1992: 102-103). Daoism consistently described such practices as improper and heterodox, even though they were covertly practiced within certain Daoist sects (Despeux 2000: 405).

===Celibate and monastic life===
Women Daoists who chose to become nuns typically lived in temples known as ''[[Taoist temple|guan]]'' (觀) that began in the 5th to 6th centuries. [[Celibacy]] was associated with early Daoist schools. The reformer [[Kou Qianzhi]] (365-448), who probably influenced by the [[Buddhism and sexuality|Buddhist model]], established celibacy among the [[The Northern Celestial Masters|Northern Celestial Masters]] (Despeux 2000: 399). Similarly, the Shangqing School emphasized that [[chastity]] was necessary for an adept to visualize deities. Although the Shangqing founder [[Tao Hongjing]] (456-536) was celibate, the [[Maoshan]] institutions that he directed provided housing for adepts of both sexes and their children (Strickmann 1978: 471). 

Daoism has a long history of polemics over sexual abstinence. Some, such as Song Wenming (宋文明) of the early 6th century strongly recommended that all Daoists be celibate; others preferred family life, such as Li Bo (季播) who presented a memorial to the emperor in the early 7th century recommending that he not prohibit Daoist clergy from marrying (Maspero 1981: 411, 425). 

[[File:Yu Xuanji.jpg|150px|thumb|Woodblock illustration of [[Yu Xuanji]], 1772 ''Lichao mingyuan shici'' (歷朝名媛詩詞)]]
As mentioned above, Daoist temples during the Tang period segregated women's and men's institutions. Promiscuity was prevalent in some Tang monasteries, for example, the Xianyi guan (咸宜觀, Abbey of Universal Benefit) in Chang'an. It was named after Princess Xianyi, the twenty-second daughter of Emperor Xuanzong, who became a Daoist nun and entered the abbey in 762. Many widows from wealthy families became Xianyi nuns, and continued living in luxury, aided by their servants. The nuns mingled with women from many social classes, such as the celebrated courtesan and poet [[Yu Xuanji]] (c. 844-869), who was born into a poor family and married a Tang official as his second wife. After denunciation by his first wife, she joined the abbey, took the poet [[Wen Tingyun]] (812-870) as her lover, and became renowned as a leader in [[Tang poetry]] (Despeux 2000: 400). 

[[Sex segregation]] in Daoist institutions became stricter under the Song. In 927, [[Emperor Taizu of Song|Emperor Taizu]] issued the following edict: "There are decadent tendencies in the temples, including wearing rough fabric and cohabitation with women and children. This is prohibited for all Daoists. Those with family must live outside of the temple compound. From now on it shall be illegal to install someone as a Daoist without proper official authority." (tr. Despeux 2000: 400).

When the Quanzhen school spread throughout north China, they established many ''guan'' especially for women, and supported those who had lost family support. Monastic life in Quanzhen temples for both sexes was strictly regulated, and the daily schedule included periods for chanting classics, community work, and individual practices, including inner alchemical exercises (Despeux 2000: 401).

Yarsanis are also found in some rural communities in southeastern [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://looklex.com/e.o/ahl-e_haqq.htm|title=Ahl-e Haqq - LookLex Encyclopaedia|author=Tore Kjeilen |publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yarsanis say that some people call them disparagingly as "Ali-o-allahi" or "worshipers of [[Ali]]" which labels Yarsanis deny. Many Yarsanis hide their religion due to pressure of Iran's Islamic system, and there are no exact statistics of their population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bbc.com/persian/iran/2011/11/111127_l95_ahlehagh_jia_vid.shtml|title=Yarsan population}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yarsanis have a distinct religious literature primarily written in the [[Gorani language (Zaza-Gorani)|Gorani language]] which also is known as [[Hawrami dialects]]. However, few modern Yarsani can read or write Gorani (a Northwestern Iranian language belonging to the branch Zaza-Gorani) as their mother tongues are [[Southern Kurdish]] and [[Sorani Kurdish]], which belong to the other two branches of the Kurdish language family. The speakers of [[Sarli dialect|Sarli,]] living near [[Al-Hamdaniya District|Eski Kalak]] are adherents, as [[Cecil J. Edmonds|Edmonds]] (1957: 195) and Moosa (1988: 168) observed. Their central religious book is called the ''[[Kalâm-e Saranjâm]]'', written in the 15th century based on the teachings of [[Sultan Sahak]].

The goal of Yarsanism is to teach humans to achieve ultimate truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://looklex.com/e.o/ahl-e_haqq.htm|title=Haghighat time}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yarsani believe sun and fire are holy things and follow the principles of equalization, purity, righteousness, and oneness, which leads some researchers to find [[Mithraism|Mithraic]] roots in this religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbc.com/persian/iran/2011/11/111127_l95_ahlehagh_jia_vid.shtml|title=Mithraism's roots in Yarsani rituals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yarsanism is barely mentioned in historical religious books as its doctrine and rituals are largely secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kurdanyarsan.blogspot.se|title=why is there no name of Yarsanism in the old religious books?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The followers of Yarsanism perform their rituals and ceremonies in secret, but this has not relieved the harassment of many of the Yarsani by Islamic or other governments over the centuries. The followers of this religion say that after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, pressure on the Yarsani community has increased and they have been deprived and discriminated against for over 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/persian/blog-viewpoints-39211631|title="discrimination over yarsan"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the signs of Yarsanic males is an intact mustache, as the Yarsanic holy book [[Kalâm-e Saranjâm]] says that every man must have a mustache to take part in Yarsanic religious rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Yarsanism holy book Kalâm-e Saranjâm||title=mustache in yarsan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
[[File:Tambur.jpg|100px|thumb|right|The [[Kurdish tanbur|Tambur]] is a sacred symbol of Yarsanism and is played during religious  ceremonies]]
The Yarsani follow the mystical teachings of [[Sultan Sahak]]. From the Yarsani point of view, the universe is composed of two distinct yet interrelated worlds: the internal (''[[Batin (Islam)|Bātinī]]'') and the external (''[[Zahir (Islam)|zāhirī]]''), each having its own order and rules. Although humans are only aware of the outer world, their lives are governed according to the rules of the inner world. This aspect of the Yarsani faith can be identified as [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[esoterism]] which emerged under the intense influence of [[Batiniyyah|Bātinī]]-[[Sufism]] during the last two centuries.

Among other important pillars of their belief system are that the Divine Essence has successive manifestations in human form (''mazhariyyat'') and the belief in [[transmigration of the soul]] (''dunaduni'' in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]). Yarasani believe that every man needs to do what is written within their holy book, the [[Kalâm-e Saranjâm]], otherwise they are not part of Yarsan. There is no compulsion or exclusion in Yarsan – anyone who chooses to follow its precepts is welcome.

The Yarsani faith's features include [[millenarism]], [[Innatism]], [[egalitarianism]], [[metempsychosis]], [[angelology]], divine manifestation and [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]. Many of these features are found in [[Yazidism]], and they also have many things in common with [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] and [[Christianity|Christians]]. Unlike other indigenous Persian faiths, the Yarsanism explicitly reject class, caste and rank, which sets them apart from the [[Yezidis]] and [[Zoroastrians]].&lt;ref name="Hamzeh'ee"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hamzeh'ee |first=M Reza |publication-date=1990 |year=1990 |title=The Yaresan: A Sociological, Historical, and Religio-historical Study of a Kurdish Community |edition= |series=[[Islamkundliche Untersuchungen]] |volume=138 |publication-place=Berlin |publisher=Schwartz |isbn=3-922968-83-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epochs of Evolution===
According to Yarsani philosophy, the universe is evolving in through different Epochs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/اهل_حق|title= levels of evolution In Yarsanism philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} and that these Epochs are:

1. First Epoch, or ''Shari'at,'' which includes the period from [[Adam and Eve]] until [[Muhammad]], also known as the "Prophet" period.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[[Kalâm-e Saranjâm]]&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Second Epoch, or ''Tariqat,'' which includes the period from [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]] until [[Shah Khoshin]], also known as the "Doctrine" period.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

3. Third Epoch, or ''Marefat'', which includes the period from Shah Khoshin until [[Sultan Sahak]], also known as the "Mystical" period.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

4. Fourth Epoch, or ''Haqiqat'', which includes the period from [[Sultan Sahak]] until today, also known as the "Truth" period.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Divine manifestations===
The Yarsani are [[emanation]]ists and incarnationists, believing that the Divine Essence has successive [[incarnation]]s known as ''mazhariyyats'' (similar to the [[Hindu]] [[avatar]]s). They believe God manifests one primary and seven secondary manifestations in each  epoch of the world, in either angel or human form. These seven persons are known as "''Haft tan''" which means "The Seven Persons"&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The primary ''mazhariyyat'' of the First Epoch was the Divine Essence known as Khawandagar, who created the world.

The primary ''mazhariyyat'' of the Second Epoch was [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]], the fourth [[Caliph]] and first imam of [[Shia Islam]]. This explains the alternative name for Yarsanis '''Ali-Allahi''', 'Believers in the divinity of Ali'.

The primary ''mazhariyyat'' of the Third Epoch was Shah Khoshin.

In the Fourth Epoch, the primary ''mazhariyyat'' is held to be [[Sultan Sahak]]. It is said that he was given birth by Dayerak Rezbar or Khatun-e Rezbar, a Kurdish virgin, and as in the case of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]], it was a virginal conception. While sleeping under a [[pomegranate]] tree a kernel of fruit fell into her mouth when a bird pecked the fruit directly over her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Kurds: History and Culture |url=http://www.bakhawan.com/dotkurd/nebez/Inglizi/TheKurds.pdf |page=23 |author=Nebez, Jamal |publisher=Western Kurdistan Association |date=1997-09-19 |accessdate=2006-09-01 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525152728/http://www.bakhawan.com/dotkurd/nebez/Inglizi/TheKurds.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=2006-05-25 |authorlink=Jamal Nebez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Yarsani legend&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hum.uu.nl/medewerkers/m.vanbruinessen/publications/Bruinessen_Haji_Bektash_Soltan_Sahak.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; after Sultan Sahak had completed the revelation of his esoteric teachings (''haqiqat'') to his first disciples among the Guran he took his leave of them. Disappearing from the Guran country without a trace, he reappeared in Anatolia in the form of [[Haji Bektash Veli]]. He taught mystical doctrines and techniques (''tariqat'') in those lands for almost a hundred years, and then returned to the Guran country. In the perception of his disciples there, he had been away for only an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbedrosian.com/Ref/Moosa/mmes18.htm|title=Sultan Sahak: Founder of the Ahl-i Haqq|first=Matti|last=Moosa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haft Tan or seven persons===
Each Epoch in Yarsani belief saw the appearance of the seven secondary divine manifestations or ''Haft Tan''. In the First Epoch they appeared in their true angelic form, while in subsequent Epochs they appeared in human incarnations. The "''Haft Tan''" are charged with responsibility for the affairs of the internal realm.

The secondary ''mazhariyyats''  of the First Epoch include the archangels [[Gabriel]], [[Michael]], [[Israfil]] and [[Azrael]], and a female angelic being. 

The ''mazhariyyats'' of the Second Epoch include Salman, Qanbar,  [[Mohammed]], Nusayr (who is either [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] or [[Theophobus]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news-contents.blogspot.ie/2011/12/ahl-e-haq.html|title=Ahl-e Haq|website=news-contents.blogspot.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bahlool]]. It also includes [[Fatimah]], the daughter of Mohammed as the incarnation of the female angel.

The ''mazhariyyats'' of the Third Epoch include [[فضل‌الله نعیمی|Shah Fazlullah Veli]], Baba Sarhang Dudani and Baba Naous.

In the Fourth Epoch, the ''Haft Tan'' or 'seven persons' charged by Sultan Sahak with responsibility for the affairs of the inner realm consist of the following:&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ZMHFaithRitualCultureAmongAH|title=Faith Ritual and Culture Among Ahle-Haqq|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "''Haft Tan''" (The Seven [[Archangels]]) are key figures in the Yarsani belief system and their history. The only female among them is Khatun-e Rezbar, the mother of Sultan Sahak.
# Pir Benjamin, considered the [[incarnation]] of the archangel [[Gabriel]];and he has the preceptor title to all Yarsanis (Monday)
# Pir Musi, the [[incarnation]] of the archangel [[Michael]] and known as [[Recording angel]] (Tuesday)
# Mustafā'Dawan, the incarnation of archangel [[Azrael]] (Wednesday)
# [[Sultan Sahak]], the incarnation of Divine Essence (Thursday)
# Baba Yadegar, Also known as "''Ahmad''" and "''Reza''" (Friday)
# Khatun-e Razbar. (Saturday) 
# Dawud koswar (David) Notice slang called Daoo, He is known as "''Dalil''" (in Kurdish Language) to all Yarsanis (Sunday) &lt;ref&gt;{{[[Kalâm-e Saranjâm]]|title=yarsan holy book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These seven persons are known as "''Haft tan''" Which means by word "The Seven Persons" &lt;ref&gt;{{[[Kalâm-e Saranjâm]]|title=yarsan holy book}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Transmigration of the soul===
Yarsanis also have a belief in [[transmigration of the soul]] (''dunaduni'' in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]). The Yarsani have a famous saying about death; "Men! Do not fear the punishment of death! The death of man is like the dive which the duck makes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Milani |first=Milad |year= 2013 |page= 110 |title= Sufism in the Secret History of Persia |isbn= 978-1-84465-677-6|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PfTOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human beings go through a cycle of 1001 incarnations. During this process, they may become more purified based on their actions. This process is confined however, only to Yarsanis - the ''zarda-gel'' or people created of yellow clay. Everyone else belongs to the ''ḵāk-e sīāh'' or people created of black earth, and are eternally damned.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ahl-e-haqq-people|title=AHL-E ḤAQQ – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holy Texts===
The traditions of the Yarsani are preserved in poetry known as ''[[Kalam-e Saranjam]]'' (''The Discourse of Conclusion''), divinely revealed narratives passed down orally through the generations. These traditions are said to have been written down by Pir Musi, one of the seven companions of Sultan Sahak (also the angel in charge of recording human deeds).&lt;ref name="mirhosseini"&gt;Z. Mir-Hosseini (1994). "Inner Truth and Outer History: The Two Worlds of the Ahl-e Haqq of Kurdistan", ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', Vol.26, pp.267-269.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection consists of the epochs of Khawandagar [God], ‘Alī, Shah Khoshin and Sultan Sahak, the different manifestations of [[divinity]]. The epoch of Shah Khoshin takes place in [[Lorestān Province|Luristan]] and the epoch of Sultan Sahak is placed in [[Hawraman]] near the [[Diyala River|Sirwan River]], the land of the [[Southern Kurdish|Goranî]]. Also important to the [[Southern Kurdish|Goranî]] is the Daftar-e kezana-ye Perdivari (''Book of the Treasure of Perdivar''), a collection of twenty six mythological poems or ''kalams''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The sayings attributed to Sultan Sahak are written in [[Gorani language (Zaza-Gorani)|Gorani]] Kurdish, the sacred language of the Ahl-e Haqq, which also is known as [[Hawrami dialects]]. However, few modern Yarsani can read or write Gorani (a Northwestern Iranian language belonging to the branch Zaza-Gorani) as their mother tongues are [[Southern Kurdish]] and [[Sorani Kurdish]], which belong to the other two branches of the Kurdish language family. Some Yarsani literature is written in the Persian language.&lt;ref name="leezenberg"&gt;{{cite web |last=Leezenberg |first=Michiel |url=http://home.hum.uva.nl/oz/leezenberg/GInflCK.rtf |title=Gorani Influence on Central Kurdish: Substratum or Prestige Borrowing? |format= [[Rich Text Format|RTF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship==
===Holy Sites===
[[File:Dawu Tomb Zarde Village.JPG|200px|thumb|right|The Holy Tomb of Dawoud is one of the sacred shrines of Yarsinism]]
Two important sanctuaries of the Yarsani are the tomb of Bābā Yādgār about 40km away from [[Sarpol-e Zahab]] in [[Kermanshah Province]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historicaliran.blogspot.ie/2009/12/baba-yadegar-shrine.html|title=Baba Yadegar Shrine|website=historicaliran.blogspot.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the tomb of Dawoud at [[Zardeh, Dalahu|Zarde]] about three kilometres east of Sarpol-e Zahab.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.let.uu.nl/~martin.vanbruinessen/personal/publications/Bruinessen_Veneration_of_Satan_among_the_Ahl-i_Haqq_of_Guran.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/articles/place/dukkan-e-daud/?|title=Dukkan-e Daud - Livius|website=www.livius.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important shrine is that of Sultan Suhak in [[Sheykhan, Kermanshah|Sheykhan]] near Perdīvar bridge in Kermanshah Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahle-haqq.com/formation.html|title=Ahl-e Haqq - Formation of the Order|website=www.ahle-haqq.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The tombs of Pir Benjamin and Pir Musi in the town of [[Kerend]] in [[Kermanshah Province]], Iran are also important shrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/10772192/The_Cults_of_the_Angels_The_Indigenous_Religions_of_Kurdistan|title=The Cults of the Angels: The Indigenous Religions of Kurdistan|first=L K|last=Robert|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customs===
One of Yarsani men's apparent signs is to have a full moustache, because in the holy book [[Kalâm-e Saranjâm]] it says that every man has to have a moustache to take part in their religious rites.

The concourse of Yarsanis is called the ''jam khana.'' They gather there for [[:tr:Ehl-i Hakk Âyin-î Cemi|Ahl-e Haqq Jam]] similar to [[Jem (Alevism)|Jem]] in [[Alevism]] and they use ''[[Kurdish tanbur|tambour]]'' for meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmM2-I0EZXM|title=یه شبی زار و پریشان در میخانه زدم|f irst=|last=Amir Drs|date=22 December 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
===Khandans or spiritual houses===
Yarsanism is organised into spiritual houses or Khandans, seven of which were established at the time of Sultan Sahak, and four afterwards, making eleven Khandans in all. The Khandans were established when, along with the ''Haft Tan'', Sultan Sahak also formed the ''Haft Tawane'', a group of seven holy persons charged with the affairs of the outer world.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; They were Say-yed Mohammad, Say-yed Abu'l Wafa, Haji Babusi, Mir Sur, Say-yed Mostafa, Sheykh Shahab al-Din and Sheykh Habib Shah. Each of the ''Haft Tawane'' was charged with responsibility for the guidance of a number of followers, and these followers formed the original seven Khandans, namely Shah Ebrahim, Baba Yadegar, Ali Qalandar, Khamush, Mir Sur, Sey-yed Mosaffa and Hajji Babu Isa. After Sultan Sahak's time another four  khandans were established, namely Atesh Bag, Baba Heydar, Zolnour and Shah Hayas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://looklex.com/e.o/ahl-e_haqq.htm|title=Ahl-e Haqq - LookLex Encyclopaedia|first=Tore|last=Kjeilen|website=looklex.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahle-haqq.com/rituals.html|title=Ahl-e Haqq - Rituals and Traditions|website=www.ahle-haqq.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Yarsani therefore belongs to one specific khandan, which is led by a spiritual leader called a say-yed, to whom each member must swear obedience.  The say-yed is the spiritual leader of the community and is normally present during the ceremonies attended by the followers. Say-yeds are the only ones allowed to have full access to the religious texts of Yarsanism, and have traditionally competed with each other to have the largest number of followers. The position of Say-yed is hereditary, being passed down through the generations from the original  founders. As the say-yed are considered spiritual 'parents', it is the tradition for them not to marry their followers.

==Demographics==
The majority of Yarsanis are found in the Kurdish areas of Iran and Iraq, especially in [[Hawraman]] and the [[Kermanshah province]] of Iran.

===In Iran===
{{main|Goran Kurds|Kurdish people}}
The Yarsani in Iran are mostly found in [[Lorestan Province|Lorestan]] and [[Kermanshah province]]s&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; There are also large communities of Yarsanis in some regions of [[Iranian Azerbaijan]]. The town of [[Ilkhichi]] (İlxıçı), which is located 87&amp;nbsp;km south west of [[Tabriz]] is almost entirely populated by Yarsanis. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} For political reasons, one of which was to create a distinct identity for these communities, they have not been called [[Goran Kurds]] since the early 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} They are called various names, such as [[Ali-Ilahis]] and Ahl-e Haqq. Both the [[Dersim]] ''([[Zazaki]] / [[Zaza people|Zaza]])'' people and the [[Southern Kurdish|Gorani]], who speak a language that is considered to belong to the [[Hawrami|Hawramani]] branch of the North West [[Iranian languages]], adhere to a form of Kurdish [[Alawites|Alawi faith]] which resembles the religions of the [[Yezidi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kurdish Culture and Society, an Annotated Bibliography|page=8|first1=Lokman I. |first2=Kelly L. |last1=Meho |last2=Maglaughlin |year=2001 |isbn=0-313-31543-4|url=https://books.google.pt/books?id=sl4PIeyWriUC&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ali-Illahism|Ali-Ilahians]] or [[Druze]].

===In Iraq===
The Yarsani are known in Iraq as the '''Kaka'i'''. There are Yarsani in Iraqi Kurdistan, around [[Kirkuk]] and [[Sulaymaniyah]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  The speakers of [[Sarli dialect|Sarli,]] living near [[Al-Hamdaniya District|Eski Kalak]] in Iraq, are adherents, as [[Cecil J. Edmonds|Edmonds]] (1957: 195) surmised and Moosa (1988: 168) observed.
===In Turkey===
Yarsanis are also found in some rural communities in southeastern [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://looklex.com/e.o/ahl-e_haqq.htm|title=Ahl-e Haqq - LookLex Encyclopaedia|author=Tore Kjeilen|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with other religious groups==
[[File:Dukkan-e Davood (4130696198).jpg|150px|thumb|right|Rock carving at Dukkan-e Davood]]
A group of native, allegedly Iranian, but archaeologically [[Mesopotamian]], monotheistic religions practiced by Kurds consisting of [[Yarsani]] and [[Êzidî]] along with [[Chinarism|Chinarism/Ishikism ''(Ishik Alevism)'']] are claimed as "[[Yazdânism]]" by [[Mehrdad Izady]].&lt;ref name="Izady"&gt;{{Citation |last=Izady |first=Mehrdad R. |year=1992 |title=The Kurds: A Concise Handbook |publication-place=Washington &amp; London |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |pages=170 passim |isbn=0-8448-1727-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An excerpt from the French Review of the Muslim World&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Notes sur la sect des Ahlé-Haqq |journal=Revue du Monde Musulman |year=1920 |last=Minorsky |first=Vladimir |authorlink=Vladimir Minorsky |volume=40-41 |page=20 |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k103836s/f24.image |accessdate=2017-03-25|language=french}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the difficulty in nomenclature for Yarsanism and related Shi'ite mysticism. The English translation reads:

{{quote|First of all, we must clear up the confusion resulting from the variety of names given to the sect of "Ahlé-Haqq", which are liable to be misunderstood. Like any religion, the one we are dealing with considers itself to be the only true and orthodox one, and it is natural that its adherents give themselves the name of "People of Truth" (''Ahlé-Haqq'' or ''Ahlé-Haqîqat''). This term lacks precision, as other sects, for example the [[Hurufism|Horoufis]], occasionally apply it to themselves. Still, the name Ahlé-Haqq to refer to the sect of our particular interest has every advantage over appellations such as "[[Ghulat|Gholat]]", "[[Ali-Illahism|Alî-Allâhi]]", and "[[Alawites|Noséïri]]" that the Muslims and most European travellers use in speaking of them. The first term, which encompasses all of the extremist Shi’ites, is too broad and too vague. The second term, "deifiers of Ali", has the same fault and emphasizes what is only a detail in the religious system under discussion. Finally, the name "[[Nusairi|Noséïri]]" belongs to that well-defined Syrian religion, which, despite some resemblances with the doctrines of the Ahlé-Haqq (the worship of Ali, the communion, etc.), appears to present a complex of quite different old beliefs.}}

===Relations with Islam===
''Ahl-e Haqq'' view Islam as a product of a cycle of divine essence, which was made manifest in [[Ali]], and established the stage of [[Sharia|''shai'at'']] (Islamic law). This was followed by the cycle of [[Tariqa|''tariqat'']] (Sufi teachings), then ''[[ma'rifa]]t'' (Sufi gnosis), and finally the current cycle of [[haqiqa]]t (Ultimate Truth), which was made manifest in [[Sultan Sahak]]. The final stage supersedes the previous ones, which frees Ahl-e Haqq from observing the shari'a rules incumbent on Muslims. Ahl-i Haqq class other Muslims as either Ahl-i Tashayyu (followers of Shi'ism) or Ahl-i Tasannun (followers of Sunnism). The Ahl-i Haqq neither observe Muslim rites, such as daily prayers and fasting during the month of Ramadan, nor share Islamic theology and sacred space, such as belief in the day of resurrection and sanctity of the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Mir-Hosseini, "Inner Truth and Outer History: The Two Worlds of the Ahl-e Haqq of Kurdistan", ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', Vol.26, 1994, p.267–268&lt;/ref&gt;

Extremist Sunni Islamic groups such as the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] and [[al-Qaeda]] regard the followers of Yarsanism as unbelievers who have to convert to Islam or die. These militants have prosecuted Yarsanis during the [[Iraq conflict (2003–present)|Iraq conflict]], possibly prompting some Iraqi Yarsan community leaders to declare in 2013 that their people were actually Muslims to avoid sectarian attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/islamic-state-terror-group-surges-iraq-disputed-territories/4455890.html |title=IS Terror Group Surges in Iraq's Disputed Territories |author=Rikar Hussein |work=[[Voice of America]] |date=26 June 2018 |accessdate=4 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/iraq-islamic-state-kakai-minority/4455712.html |title=IS Attacks Drive Members of Iraqi Kakai Minority From Their Villages |author=Dilshad Anwar |work=[[Voice of America]] |date=26 June 2018 |accessdate=1 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yazda was established to support the [[Yazidi]], who are a minority [[ethnoreligious group]] around the world, especially in northern [[Iraq]], specifically [[Sinjar]] and [[Nineveh Plain]], and northeastern [[Syria]], where the Yazidi community has, as part of a deliberate "military, economic, and political strategy," been the focus of a [[genocide|genocidal]] campaign by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]&lt;ref name=USHMM-BearingWitnessReport-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kikoler|first1=Naomi|title=Iraq Bearing Witness Trip Report: "Our Generation is Gone" The Islamic State's Targeting of Iraqi Minorities in Ninewa|url=https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/Iraq-Bearing-Witness-Report-111215.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]|date=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} that included mass murder, the separation of families, forced religious conversions, forced marriages, sexual assault, physical assault, torture, kidnapping, and slavery.&lt;ref name=HumanRightsWatch-MassGraves-2016&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq: Protect Mass Graves.

== History ==
In August 2014, Yazda was founded by a group of [[Yazidi]] and Yazidi American activists in the United States centered around Yazidi communities in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Nebraska]],&lt;ref name=KETV-NebraskanYazidis-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Dave|last2=McCartney|first2=Rob|last3=Petersen|first3=Brandi|title=Nebraskan Yazidis want to stop carnage by Islamic State in Iraq|url=http://www.ketv.com/news/nebraskan-yazidis-want-to-stop-carnage-by-islamic-state-in-iraq/29633206|accessdate=24 September 2016|work=[[KETV]]|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NETNebraska-WelcomeNE-2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Jack|title=Yazidis from Iraq Find Welcome Refuge in Nebraska|url=http://netnebraska.org/article/news/1108600/yazidis-iraq-find-welcome-refuge-nebraska|work=[[Nebraska Educational Telecommunications|NET Nebraska]]|date=14 December 2017|format=Includes audio}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Houston]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref name=VOA-YazdaOrganization-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flakus|first1=Greg|title=America’s Heartland Helps Iraq's Yazidis|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/america-heartland-helps-yazidis-in-iraq/2919092.html|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=[[Voice of America]]|date=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VOA-YazdaActivistSocialWorkAward-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flakus|first1=Greg|title=Yazidi-American Activist Seeks Help for Refugees|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/yazidi-american-activist-seeks-help-refugees/2986102.html|accessdate=24 September 2016|work=[[Voice of America]]|date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VOA-Nebraska-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flakus|first1=Greg|title=Yazidi Americans Seek Help for their People|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/yazidi-americans-sek-help-for-their-people/2988456.html|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=[[Voice of America]]|date=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to education initiatives that explain Yazidi culture and religion, Yazda runs a Yazda's Center in [[Kurdistan]], [[Iraq]], and assists victims of the genocide and rape that began in Iraq in 2014.&lt;ref name=USHMM-BearingWitnessReport-2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN-Genocide-2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HumanRightsWatch-YezidiWomen-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wheeler|first1=Skye|title=Yezidi Women After Slavery: Trauma|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/18/yezidi-women-after-slavery-trauma|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mission of Yazda was advocating in the United States during ISIL's attack on [[Sinjar]]. Yazda helped by providing humanitarian assistance in the form of food and water to approximately 60,000 [[Yazidis]], who were stranded on mountain Sinjar by ISIL during the week of August 3, 2014. At this point, Yazda began its work trying to locate and help free Yazidi women and girls, more than 3,200 of whom were captured, enslaved, and are still held hostage by the Islamic State.&lt;ref name=CBS-WBBM-MatthewBarber-2016&gt;{{cite news|title=3,000 Girls and Women Sold as Sex Slaves By ISIS, Chicago Student Heads to Iraq to Save Them|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2015/09/15/yazidi-girls-women-sex-slaves/|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=[[WBBM-TV]] – CBS Chicago|date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those women and girls are victims of human trafficking and sexual slavery.&lt;ref name=HumanRightsWatch-YezidiWomen-2016 /&gt;

=== Organization ===
Yazda is run by teams of volunteers in the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], and [[Iraq]]. A large portion of the volunteers emigrated after working as translators during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and in other conflicts that involved the U.S. military.&lt;ref name=AmesTrib-YazidiWomen-2015 /&gt; Chicago graduate student, Matthew Barber, was Executive Director for a period of one year.&lt;ref name=CBS-WBBM-MatthewBarber-2016 /&gt; Murad Ismael, co-founder of Yazda, is the current Executive Director.&lt;ref name=ViceNews-ICC-2015 /&gt;

== Projects ==

Yazda supports survivors of the Yazidi genocide through numerous aid and relief programs. Yazda has a Medical Center in Iraq and supports thousands of people in need of primary medical care and first aid services. Yazda also has a mobile clinic in Sinjar to support the Yazidis in the remote areas and villages around Sinjar. Yazda conducts missions to provide humanitarian aids and relief services of clean water, clothing, and food to as many displaced people as possible.&lt;ref name=RTIntl-VianInterview-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shevardnadze|first1=Sophie|title=Children born to ISIL sex slaves are taken to be trained into murderers – Yazidi aid worker|url=https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/324712-children-isil-sex-slaves/|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=[[RT (TV network)|RT International]]|date=4 December 2015|language=en-EN|format=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Genocide documentation ===
The genocide documentation project started on the October 17, 2014. Yazda worked with the Voices of Rwanda, an organization that has been documenting the Rwanda's genocide, to train and support Yazda's documentation team. The team works on recording Yazidi survivors and eyewitness testimonies of the genocidal campaign. The team locates and investigates the mass graves of Yazidis.&lt;ref name=AlJazeera-MountSinjar-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beck|first1=John|title=Iraq's Yazidis living in fear on Mount Sinjar|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/iraq-yazidis-living-fear-mount-sinjar-160726063155982.html|accessdate=24 September 2016|work=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AlArabiya-MassGraves-2016&gt;{{cite news|title=ISIS buried thousands in 72 mass graves|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/2016/08/30/ISIS-buried-thousands-in-72-mass-graves.html|accessdate=24 September 2016|work=[[Al Arabiya]]|agency=[[The Associated Press]]|date=30 August 2016|location=Hardan, Iraq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Yazda and [[Human Rights Watch]] issued an official report regarding the discovered mass graves.&lt;ref name=HumanRightsWatch-MassGraves-2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yazda-DocumentationProjectReport-2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barber|first1=Matthew|last2=Khalaf|first2=Ali|last3=Slater|first3=Andrew|last4=Chomer|first4=Jameel Ghanem|last5=‘Ajo|first5=Mahmood|title=A Report from the Yazda Documentation Project on Mass Graves of Yazidis Killed by the Islamic State Organization or Local Affiliates On or After  August 3, 2014|date=28 January 2016|publisher=Yazda|url=https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://www.yazda.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Yazda-Report-on-Mass-Graves-Jan-28-2016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Regarding this matter, Yazda had urged the international community to formally investigate the mass graves before evidence was lost at those sites because of the fact that Sinjar is still a war zone and the sites of genocide are unprotected. The team also investigates the general devastation of Yazidi community and damage of Yazidis properties following ISIL's attack, and has worked in support of assisting Western media to document the story.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-Callimachi-Reporting-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Erika|title=Kidnapping and Sex Slavery: Covering ISIS’ Religious Justification for Rape|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/insider/kidnapping-and-sex-slavery-covering-isiss-religious-justification-for-rape.html|accessdate=24 September 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psycho-social support and Women's Center ===
Yazda began a psycho-social program in its center in [[Dohuk]], [[Iraq]], for the Yazidi women and girls who managed to escape or are rescued from ISIL. The women and girls suffer from severe physical and mental abuse and require post-trauma support.&lt;ref name=KRG-InternationalSupport-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=KRG Cabinet|title=KRG officials call upon the international community to help abducted Kurdish Yezidi women|url=http://cabinet.gov.krd/a/d.aspx?s=040000&amp;l=12&amp;a=52363|accessdate=24 September 2016|work=حکومەتی هەرێمی كوردستان [[Kurdistan Regional Government]]|date=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CSM-MentalHealthResources-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Soguel|first1=Dominique|title=For Yazidis traumatized by Islamic State horrors, few mental health resources|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2015/1007/For-Yazidis-traumatized-by-Islamic-State-horrors-few-mental-health-resources|accessdate=24 September 2016|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yazda helps them recover from the trauma and reintegrate into society via response programs to help the women with methods that include individual therapy and often require long-term treatment.&lt;ref name=CNN-MatthewBarber-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sesay|first1=Isha|title=Looking at the plight of the Yazidis|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD7rq89VTeQ|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=[[CNN]]|date=17 September 2015|format=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL's genocidal campaign against the Yazidis resulted in the abduction and enslavement of thousands Yazidis, the majority of which were women and girls. Yazda volunteers and the office of Yazidi affairs in Kurdistan have collected the names of approximately 5,000 abducted Yazidis after the genocidal campaign. These abductees were subjected to systematic sexual abuse and rape, and those who still held hostage face the same daily abuses even to the present day.&lt;ref name=VICENews-StillHostages-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilbert|first1=Benjamin|title=ISIS is still holding nearly 2,000 Yazidi women as slaves|url=https://news.vice.com/article/isis-is-still-holding-nearly-2000-yazidi-women-as-slaves|accessdate=24 September 2016|work=[[Vice (magazine)|VICE News]]|date=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AlArabiya-ISISStillHostages-2016&gt;{{cite news|title=ISIS tightens grip on women held as sex slaves|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2016/07/06/ISIS-tightens-grip-on-women-held-as-sex-slaves.html|accessdate=24 September 2016|work=[[Al Arabiya]]|agency=[[The Associated Press]]|date=6 July 2016|location=Khanke, Iraq}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of 2016, over 2,000 abducted Yazidi women and girls returned to freedom, either by escaping or by being rescued. Many cases of rescue or escape involve women and girls being reunited with destitute families in the rough conditions of [[internally displaced person|Internally Displaced Person (IDP)]] [[displaced persons camp|camps]] or squalid conditions of other locations where displaced families have taken refuge. Some escapees have lost all relatives to ISIL's massacres and did not have immediate families to return to.
