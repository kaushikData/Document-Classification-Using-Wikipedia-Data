'''1882 in sport''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[American football]]==
'''College championship'''
* [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|College football national championship]] – [[Yale Bulldogs football|Yale Bulldogs]]
'''Events'''
* At the 1882 rules meeting, [[Walter Camp]] proposes that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined with the already-established line of scrimmage, transform the game from a variation of rugby or association football into the distinct sport of American football.

==[[Association football]]==
'''England'''
* [[1882 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] – [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]] 1–0 [[Blackburn Rovers]] at [[The Oval]], the first time that a professional club has reached the final
* [[Tottenham Hotspur]] founded as Hotspur FC by members of the Hotspur Cricket Club in Tottenham.
'''Ireland'''
* 18 February — [[Ireland national football team (1882 to 1950)|Ireland]] makes its international debut, losing 13–0 to [[England national football team|England]] in Belfast.  Ireland is the world's fourth international team following England, Scotland and Wales.
'''Scotland'''

Apart from Sullivan's famous 1889 fight against [[Jake Kilrain]], this is the last major bareknuckle contest fought under London Prize Ring Rules.

{{Nihongo|'''ASICS'''|アシックス|Ashikkusu}} (stylized as '''''asics''''') is a Japanese [[multinational corporation]] which produces footwear and sports equipment designed for a wide range of sports, generally in the upper price range. The name is an acronym for the [[Latin]] phrase ''[[Mens sana in corpore sano|anima sana in corpore sano]]''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.asicsamerica.com/about-asics|title = About ASICS|accessdate = 2015-08-31|publisher = ASICS America}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which translates as "Healthy soul in a healthy body". In recent years their running shoes have often been ranked among the top performance footwear in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-240-400--12278-0,00.html |title=Runner's World Crowns Asics Gel-Nimbus 9 "The World's Best Shoe!" |publisher=Runnersworld.com |date=2007-11-02 |accessdate=2015-08-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201093614/http://runnersworld.com/article/0%2C7120%2Cs6-240-400--12278-0%2C00.html |archivedate=2007-12-01 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://dailyviews.runnersworld.com/2008/11/the-prez-elect.html|title = The Prez-Elect Wears Asics|publisher = Dailyviews.runnersworld.com|date = 2008-11-14|accessdate = 2015-08-31|last = Remy|first = Mark|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090716204736/http://dailyviews.runnersworld.com/2008/11/the-prez-elect.html|archivedate = 2009-07-16|dead-url = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASICS Ltd. began as Onitsuka Co., Ltd on September 1, 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Asics History | url=http://www.asics.com/aboutus/index_C.html | accessdate=2009-03-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090302231248/http://www.asics.com/aboutus/index_C.html| archivedate= 2 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its founder, Kihachiro Onitsuka, began manufacturing basketball shoes in his home town of [[Kobe]], [[Hyogo Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. Soon after the range of sports activities widened to a variety of Olympic styles used throughout the '50s, '60s and '70s by athletes worldwide. Onitsuka became particularly renowned for the Mexico 66&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tigercentral.co.uk/onitsuka-tiger-trainers/mexico-66.html Mexico 66, Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66, Onitsuka Mexico 66 | Tiger Central] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304203411/http://www.tigercentral.co.uk/onitsuka-tiger-trainers/mexico-66.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; design, in which the distinctive crossed stripes, now synonymous with the company brand, were featured for the first time. In 1977, [[Onitsuka Tiger]] merged with GTO and JELENK to form ASICS Corporation. Despite the name change, a vintage range of ASICS shoes are still produced and sold internationally under the Onitsuka Tiger label.

In its 2006 fiscal year, Asics generated 171 billion yen in net sales and 13 billion yen in net income. Sixty-six percent of the company's income came from the sale of sports shoes, 24% from sportswear, and 10% from sports equipment. Forty-nine percent of the company's sales were in Japan, 28% in North America, and 19% in Europe.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

On July 12, 2010, ASICS bought the Swedish [[Hiking equipment|outdoor]] brand [[Haglöfs]], for [[Swedish krona|SEK]]1,000,000,000 ($128.7&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTOE66B05E20100712 |title=Japan's Asics buys Sweden's Haglofs for $128.7 mln |publisher=Reuters |date= 2010-07-12|accessdate=2011-05-19 |first=Mariko |last=Katsumura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2011, it was announced that ASICS will be the new official kit manufacturer for the [[Australian Cricket Team]], replacing German manufacturer [[Adidas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/asics_partner_with_cricket_australia/|title = Asics partner with Cricket Australia – Sports Sponsorship news – Cricket Oceania|publisher = SportsPro Media|date = 2011-11-04|accessdate = 2012-06-11|last = Emmett|first = James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==

The name ASICS is an [[acronym]] of the Latin phrase ''anima sana in corpore sano''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which translates to "healthy soul in a healthy body" and derives from [[Juvenal]]'s aphorism ''[[mens sana in corpore sano]]''.

==Relationship with Nike==

[[Nike, Inc.]], originally known as Blue Ribbon Sports, was founded to sell [[Onitsuka Tiger]] shoes in the US. When [[Phil Knight]] visited Japan in 1963 shortly after he graduated from Stanford University, he was impressed by Onitsuka Tiger shoes with their high quality but reasonable prices. He immediately visited the Onitsuka Tiger office and asked to be their sales agent in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967823709|title=Shoe dog : a memoir by the creator of Nike|last=Phil.|first=Knight,|date=2016|publisher=Scribner Book Company|isbn=9781501135910|oclc=967823709}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a number of years, their relationship crumbled and both companies sued each other, with Nike retaining the naming rights to several shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967823709|title=Shoe dog : a memoir by the creator of Nike|last=Phil.|first=Knight,|date=2016|publisher=Scribner Book Company|isbn=9781501135910|oclc=967823709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A Celebration of Horses: The American Saddlebred''' was a half-hour television special about the [[American Saddlebred]] horse breed.  As a pilot episode, it was scheduled for four national releases from November 1993 to October 1995 on the [[Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)]] in the [[United States]] on 56 regional affiliates, and was also broadcast into Canada.  The program starred actor and horse enthusiast [[William Shatner]].  Most of the segments were taped on location with Shatner at his [[Belle Reve Farm]], and at the [[Lexington Junior League Horse Show]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].


==Concept and creation==
[[File:The American Saddlebred magazine 1994.jpg|thumb|upright| ''American Saddlebred'' coverage of the episode.]]

The documentary was produced as the pilot episode for a proposed PBS series titled ''A Celebration of Horses''. The series was designed to showcase the history of various horse breeds, the evolution of equestrian sports and the preparation required for horse show competition. The series' origins correlated with the stated vision of former [[United States Equestrian Federation|ASHA]] president Judy Werner, who said in the organization's 1989 Annual Meeting, "Don't we all feel that a television, radio, or magazine advertisement focusing on 'The Sport of Showing Horses,' regardless of the breed, would make us all proud? Convey to the public a positive feeling about the sport? Be effective? I do, and I guarantee you that is going to happen..."&lt;ref name=TASB&gt;{{cite journal | journal = The American Saddlebred | publisher=American Saddlebred Horse Association|title= TV Series Featuring Saddlebreds Honored | page=88 | date=January 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series concept originated with executive producer Betty Wills, a competitor in equine sports. Patricia Nichols, former executive secretary of the [[American Saddlebred Horse Association]];&lt;ref name=SHR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saddlehorsereport.com/news.aspx?cid=8088#.VvUoDMccP6Q|title=Patricia Nichols Dies|publisher=The Saddle Horse Report|date=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lynn Weatherman, former editor of ''The American Saddlebred'' magazine,&lt;ref name=EQUUS&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://equusmagazine.com/article/weatherman_041506|title=Saddlebred Legend Lynn Weatherman Dies|publisher=EQUUS Magazine|date=April 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; participated as technical advisors in the production and also provided some of the [[stock footage]].

Shatner also appears competing at the Lexington Junior League Horse Show and in an interview after his performance.  The episode ended with the intense head-to-head competition between two of the all-time greatest [[five-gaited]] Champions of their time, the [[stallion]] [[Sky Watch (horse)|Sky Watch]] and the [[gelding]] [[Imperator (horse)|Imperator]], in the stake competition at the Freedom Hall Civic Center in [[Johnson City, Tennessee]]; referred to by some as "the biggest stage in the show horse industry."&lt;ref name="KHP"&gt;{{cite web|title=CH Sky Watch|url=http://www.kyhorsepark.com/equine-theme-park/park-memorials-statues/memorial-walk-champions/ch-sky-watch-bio|website=Kentucky Horse Park|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Funkhouser&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saddlehorsereport.com/news.aspx?cid=1386#.VvQNpcccP6Q|title=A Celebration Of History, A Celebration Of Challenges, A Celebration Of Tomorrow|author=Bob Funkhouser|date=September 15, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14201">The first [[Athlete of the Year]] award in the [[United States]] was initiated by the [[Associated Press]] (AP) in 1931. At a time when [[women's sports|women in sports]] were not given the same recognition as men, the AP offered a male and a female athlete of the year award to either a professional or amateur [[Sportsperson|athlete]]. The awards are voted on annually by a panel of AP sports editors from across the United States. A large majority of the winners have been Americans. However, non-Americans are also eligible for the honor, and have won on a few occasions.

The '''British League of Racing Cyclists''' ('''BLRC''') was an association formed in 1942 to promote [[road bicycle racing]] in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]]. It operated in competition with the [[National Cyclists' Union]], a rivalry which lasted until the two merged in 1959 to form the [[British Cycling|British Cycling Federation]].

==Background==
The [[National Cyclists' Union]] (NCU) had, since the end of the 19th century, banned racing on the roads, fearing the police would ban all cycling as a result.&lt;ref name=Chas&gt;{{cite book| last=Messenger| first=Chas| authorlink=Chas Messenger| title=Ride and be Damned| publisher=Pedal Publishing| location=Harpenden| year=1998| isbn=978-0-9534096-0-0| page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; A call for a ban "evoked hardly any opposition because road conditions were such that the possibility of massed racing on the highway was never even envisaged."&lt;ref&gt;Bill Mills, Personally Speaking, The Bicycle, UK, 22 July 1942, p8&lt;/ref&gt; "The position of cyclists on the roads of England and Wales had not been established and police forces had objected to cyclists racing. Matters came to a head on 21 July 1894 during a timed race on the North Road, then the main road north out of London, in which 50 riders competed with the help of other riders to pace them. A group of riders passed a woman and her horse and carriage at a point about 57 miles from the capital. The horse panicked, the riders fell off and the woman complained to the local police. They in turn banned cycle-racing on their roads."&lt;ref name=Chas/&gt;

The NCU administered not only road racing but track racing and ruled that its clubs were to move their races off the road and on to tracks, the forerunners of modern [[velodromes]]. Some clubs did but most were too far from any track and so a rebel movement began to organise not massed, paced races but individual competitions against the clock, over standard distances and held out in the countryside, in the early hours and in secret to avoid antagonising the police.

The NCU and what became the [[Road Time Trials Council]] eventually became colleagues, each administering its own section of the sport, neither allowing massed racing.

==The war and Percy Stallard==
The National Cyclists Union was the international body for cycling in England and Wales and sent teams to the [[Olympic Games]] and to world championships. It also licensed riders to compete abroad in races such as [[Bordeaux–Paris]]. But teams had to be selected not in races akin to which they were being entered but in competitions held on private roads such as airfields and car-racing courses.

One of the riders to be selected was an enthusiast from [[Wolverhampton]], [[Percy Stallard]]. The experience of massed racing stimulated him and he believed that the NCU's objection to it on grounds that it would disrupt traffic and give cycling a bad name was pointless in wartime when petrol rationing had largely cleared the roads of vehicles.

He wrote in December 1941 to A. P. Chamberlin of the NCU:

:It is amazing to think that this is the only country in Europe where this form of sport is not permitted... There seems to be the mistaken idea that it would be necessary to close the roads. This, of course, is entirely wrong... There would be no better time than now to introduce this form of racing to the roads, what with the decreased amount of motor traffic and the important part that the cycle is playing in wartime transport.

:I am convinced that to allow massed-start racing to recommence its career after the war on circuits is utter madness. Even before the war massed-start racing could not be counted as a national branch of the sport as it was only possible for riders living within easy reach of [[Donington Park|Donington]] and [[Brooklands]] [the two most circuits most used] to try their hand at the game, excepting on special occasions. It should be obvious to anyone the least bit interested that there cannot be a future to this form of racing while it is allowed to remain on the circuit.

Stallard protested that the airfields and car circuits which were the only place that the NCU would allow massed racing had been taken by the Army and [[RAF]]. Chamberlin was not impressed and replied at the end of January to say that the NCU had considered the question but considered it unwise.

==The breakaway race==

In the first week of April Stallard sent letters on the notepaper of the bicycle shop that he ran to announce his plan for a 59-mile race from [[Llangollen]] to [[Wolverhampton]] on 7 June. 

"I just explained to the police what I was doing and told them that things like that were normal on the Continent, and they said they were happy and that they'd try to help", he said."&lt;ref&gt;Up the League, Winning, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained sponsorship from the ''Wolverhampton Express and Star'' newspaper, offered any profits to the newspaper's Forces Comfort Fund, and recruited 40 riders to take part. He also asked the NCU and the Road Time Trials Council (RTTC) not to suspend those who took part "as this was liable to raise controversy detrimental to the sport."&lt;ref name=Chas/&gt;

Stallard's plan brought strong opposition not just from the NCU and RTTC but from the cycling establishment, particularly from the veteran administrator and writer [[George Herbert Stancer]]. His fear, and that of the NCU, was that asking the police for permission to hold a race ended the freedom of cyclists to hold races, or at any rate lone races against the clock, without interference.

Under the headline ''A hopeless revolt'', he wrote:

:They have plunged into their dangerous experiment without regard for the consequences... I understand that the 'rebels' want to go on holding races by police permit and under police protection; and when this is withdrawn they are apparently content to put up the shutters and go out of business as promoters.... If we voluntarily place road-racing under police control, we sign its death warrant.... If we are to race on the road, for heaven's sake let us do it as free citizens, and not by permission of the police.

Stancer's words influenced the NCU and it banned Stallard before the race had started. An agreement with the [[Road Time Trials Council]] meant that it too banned him.

Stallard went ahead and his race finished, without incident, in front of a crowd at West Park. There were 34 riders, including two Dutchmen serving in the army in Britain. The programme, priced 2d, urged: "Onlookers are earnestly requested to remain on the pavements at all times during the race." It also said that "The event is run with the kind permission of the Chief Constables of Denbighshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire and Wolverhampton." ''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' reported:

:More than a thousand people watched the finish of the massed-start race organised by Percy Stallard, from Llangollen to Wolverhampton, on Sunday afternoon. The Chief Constable of Wolverhampton, an inspector, a sergeant and 15 uniformed policemen kept the crowd back. Police cars and police motorcyclists patrolled portions of the course. A police motorcyclist led the racing men through the streets to the finish. E. A. Price, of Wolverhampton, won the sprint from his clubmate, C. J. Anslow.

The report - in which the frequent mention of the police reflected the magazine's concerns as expressed by Stancer - went on to explain that the race had been banned by the NCU and the RTTC but that there had been no incidents other than a lorry backing on to the course. Fifteen riders finished and all those involved in the race were expelled from the NCU. Stallard was banned for life for refusing to account for himself to the NCU's management.

The race result:

1. A. E. Price, Wolverhampton 2h 25min 40sec
2. C. J. Anslow, Wolverhampton, at 1sec
3. J. Holmes, RAF, at 3sec
4. J. Kremers, Royal Dutch Brigade, at 53sec
5. E. Whitmore, RAF, at 55sec
6. R. Jones, Wolverhampton, at 56sec
7. S. Trubshaw, Wolverhampton, at 1min
8. E. Turner, Wolverhampton, at 1:05
9. R. Whitmore, RAF, at 3:30
10. E. Reddish, Bradford, same time
11. J. Clark, Wolverhampton, at 3:40
12. L. Roe, Bradford, at 3:52
13. J. Rhodes, Bradford, at 5:49
14. F. Beeston, Birmingham, at 7:00
15: E. Upton, Wolverhampton, at 7:06

==British League of Racing Cyclists==
"When I ran the race," Stallard said in ''Winning'', "I didn't think anything of it. I just thought it was something that would be taken up by others. I thought that, when the point had been proved, the NCU would be only too pleased to find that they'd got a bit of activity. It had all been above board. The police had never seen one, of course, but I just told them it was in conformity with international practice and races of this type were organised in all different countries and they had no queries at all."

Further races were held elsewhere in the country and the clubs that organised them formed regional groups. The first was in the Midlands in July 1942, called by the Wolverhampton RCC.&lt;ref&gt;The Bicycle, UK, 8 July 1942&lt;/ref&gt; With nowhere to go but insistent that massed racing was the future, Stallard encouraged the groups to merge to form the British League of Racing Cyclists. The founding meeting was of 24 people at the Sherebrook Lodge Hotel, [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]] on Sunday 14 November 1942. 

The founding members - they were listed by their initials rather than their names - were M. J. Gibson, S. A. Padwick, P. T. Stallard, E. F. Angrave, J. E. Finn, R.Jones, E. R. Hickman, G. Anstee, L. Plume, G. Truelove, C. J. Fox, L. Merrills, W. W. Greaves. E. Reddish, E. Thompson, R. Hartley, K. Swaby, Chas J. Fox, S. Copley, S. Cooper, K. Pattinson, G. Clark, Mrs W. W. Greaves and Miss G. A. Stiff.

Other riders and then whole clubs joined the BLRC. British cycle racing became polarised, frequently bitterly so. Clubs could not affiliate to both the NCU and the BLRC; riders who raced in BLRC races were banned from NCU events and from [[individual time trial|time trial]]s run by the [[Cycling Time Trials|Road Time Trials Council]]. The magazine ''Cycling'' at first refused to report BLRC events. According to John Dennis, at the time racing editor of the rival paper, ''The Bicycle'':

:What has been lost beneath the clouds of myths surrounding this situation is the reason why many clubs were cautious about wholeheartedly supporting the road-racing movement. Remember that it was wartime and the younger membership of most clubs was away engaged in a war. The older members left at home did not wish to risk damaging a sport which all had enjoyed, so they decided to maintain the status quo until the war ended. The rank and file of the NCU/RTTC membership was not anti-BLRC - all it wanted to do was preserve the sport until the service men returned to civvy street.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, John: Journal, Fellowship of Cycling Old Timers, vol 151&lt;/ref&gt;

The BLRC itself wasn't that certain of its acceptance by the police. A sticker added to its membership licence read:

:'''POLICE INTERFERENCE'''
# Make no statement to the Police about anything happening during a Race.
# If questioned, say 'I do not wish to make a statement.'
# Any rider accused of any offence which he does not consider he has committed should add 'I deny that I ......... (whatever he is accused of).'
# DO NOT SAY ANYTHING ELSE
# Give full details to the organiser.

In 1943, the League promoted the first [[British National Road Race Championships|British national road race championship]], in [[Harrogate]] and later the [[Brighton]]-[[Glasgow]] stage race - a forerunner to the ''[[Daily Express]]'' [[Tour of Britain]] first run in 1951. See main entry - [[Tour of Britain]].

The BLRC also organised representative teams to races in other countries, although not through the international body, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]], by whom it wasn't recognised but through private arrangements with individuals, other breakaway organisations and sometimes through communist sports clubs which operated outside their own country's framework. From 1948 the BLRC sent a team to the [[Peace Race]], Warsaw-Berlin-Prague, considered then the world's international amateur stage race. In 1952, Ian Steel won and Britain took the team prize. That led the UCI to recognise at least the existence of the BLRC. &lt;ref&gt;The Bicycle, UK, 11 March 1953&lt;/ref&gt;  For the moment it said it would have to cooperate through the NCU but enthusiasts believed they had achieved international power.

Representatives of the NCU walked out of the meeting before the vote, saying the UCI's proposal was unconstitutional. One of its delegates, H.S. Anderson said: "There is no provision in the statute of the UCI for provisional or temporary affiliation of a national federation. The committee resolution is invalid because it violates several statutes of the UCI."&lt;ref&gt;The Bicycle, UK, 11 March 1953&lt;/ref&gt; Had they voted, the resolution would have failed.&lt;ref&gt;The Bicycle, UK, 11 March 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Tour de France==
With the BLRC now halfway through the door, Britain sent a team to the Tour de France in 1955. It was the first team ever sent since the previous riders, Bill Burl and [[Charles Holland (cyclist)|Charles Holland]] had competed as private entrants before the war. To turn down the Tour was something the NCU wouldn't do and yet it couldn't select riders who were BLRC members. To leave out BLRC members, however, would be to send a weakened team and antagonise a wavering UCI. Yet the BLRC could not select a team because the Union Cycliste Internationale didn't formally recognise it. The conundrum was solved by asking a panel of newspaper reporters to do the job instead.

==The beginning of the end==
Running the BLRC was never easy and there were frequent rows within its administration.&lt;ref name=Chas /&gt; The organiser of the first big stage race, Jimmy Kain, wrote to Stallard after the BLRC had merged with the BCF of the "two years of nervous and physical breakdown that followed the six years of BLRC office."&lt;ref&gt;Letter 1 January 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Stallard was a bright and energetic man with a vision for his sport. But he was not a man to tolerate argument or those with other views. Peter Bryan, editor of ''The Bicycle'', later an associate of ''[[Sporting Cyclist]]'' and managing editor of ''[[Cycling Weekly|Cycling]]'' said: 
:Stallard had the most abrasive nature that I have ever met. He could never believe that he could have a bad idea or make a bad decision. And sometimes he'd go berserk with those who disagreed with him. He didn't have, let us say, the delicacies of negotiation.&lt;ref name=island&gt;Woodland, Les (2005), ''This Island Race'', Mousehold Press, {{ISBN|1-874739-36-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having achieved what he wanted, with the NCU's final acceptance of massed racing on the road, Stallard placed the continuity of the BLRC over the end of the civil war that the BLRC and the NCU had conducted. He said: "The NCU were running road races and we were running road races and there wasn't any need for amalgamation [of the NCU and the BLRC, to form the [[British Cycling|British Cycling Federation]]] at all."&lt;ref name=island/&gt;

Critics said Stallard had lost sight of the intention of the BLRC, which had been to bring racing to the open road and that, once achieved, that there was no further point in rival cycling administrations. Peter Bryan said: "The BLRC was originally a gang of enthusiasts. Then along came what I'd call the parliamentarians of pedal power, men who saw a runaway organisation and decided they'd take it over."&lt;ref name=island/&gt; Stallard was influenced by those who agreed with him but in the end he and others became too much for the BLRC's other administrators and the BLRC magazine, ''The Leaguer'', reported in 1954: "There is a malignant ulcer prevalent in the cycling world common to all three racing bodies in this country. It is the taint of vanity and culminates in the clash of personality."&lt;ref name=Chas/&gt;

With both the BLRC and the NCU physically and financially reeling from a civil war that had long outlasted the war with Germany, the two merged in 1959 to form the [[British Cycling Federation]], now known as [[British Cycling]]. 

The January 1959 edition of the BLRC magazine, ''The Leaguer'', reported formally:

:This Annual General Meeting of the British League of Racing Cyclists agrees that all assets, liabilities, obligations and commitments of the British League of Racing Cyclists shall be transferred to or handed over to the British Cycling Federation as from the date of the incorporation of that body.

The text accompanying the announcement said:

:It was evident, even before the decisions of this 17th and final Annual General Meeting of the British League of Racing Cyclists were taken, that League Sections and Union Centres up and down the country were already providing the momentum for the practical activities of the British Cycling Federation. Not only has contact been established between many of them but meetings have been held and decisions taken for the setting up of the Divisions which will form the organisational basis of the new Federation.

It also said that "those who are predisposed to live in the past, and even the progressive League is old enough now to number several such in its ranks", would greet the news with surprise. Stallard saw the merger as treason by "just three people [who] were allowed the freedom to destroy the BLRC"&lt;ref name="Private letter, June 1989"&gt;Private letter, June 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and until his death saw the new [[British Cycling|British Cycling Federation]] (BCF) as a reincarnation of the NCU. In 1989 he wrote:

:I have often sat back and thought just how nice it would be if you could relive your life based on the experience gained. For myself, I would never again try to achieve the impossible by trying to change things. On the two occasions I have tried to do this [he tried to introduce age-related racing for riders older than 40], I have failed, not because I lack followers, or because of the opposition of opposing bodies, but because of the activities of anarchists and those who are envious of your success and popularity.&lt;ref name="Private letter, June 1989"/&gt;

==Inheritance==
To the question of whether Britain would have moved to massed racing anyway, without the BLRC, Peter Bryan says not, saying that the established cycling authorities had become entrenched in their positions, their own rivalry overshadowed by their joint fears and interests.

:The NCU and the RTTC were never friends. The RTTC were particular bastards and they had so many clever men in the top echelon, many more than the NCU. They were steeped in the tradition of time-trialling and what it stood for and they wouldn't budge a jot or tickle.&lt;ref name=island/&gt;

Stallard's success was that he alerted the UCI to a problem in British cycling which led the UCI to threaten Britain with exclusion from world cycling unless it sorted out the conflict between the NCU and the BLRC. Seeing the BLRC as closer to the UCI's interests, it suggested it would recognise the BLRC and not the NCU as the representative body. It was because of that that the NCU relented and agreed to license the massed races it had hitherto opposed.

"You can never say that if it didn't happen then this wouldn't have happened, but I can't see what else [other than the BLRC] would have brought it [massed racing] about," said Peter Bryan.&lt;ref name=island/&gt;

An '''eyeshield''' is a piece of [[American football|football]] equipment. It is a visor that attaches to the [[football helmet|helmet]] of a player to protect the eyes. It leaves the mouth exposed and covers the eyes and nose. Only clear eyeshields are allowed in high school football as the eyes are needed to be seen while checking for concussions. On the [[college football|college level]], a tinted eyeshield may be used if the player has eye problems. The [[National Football League|NFL]] allows dark visors (smoke or black) and reflective mirror visors, but does not allow colored or iridium visors. 

The first football visors were made by [[Oakley, Inc.|Oakley]] and are currently being made by name brands such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and [[Under Armour, Inc.|Under Armour]] as well as many other sports and eyewear companies.

'''Fixed-odds betting''' is a form of [[wagering]] against [[odds]] offered by a [[bookmaker]] or an individual or on a [[bet exchange]]. In [[Australia]], the practice is usually known as '''"SP betting"'''

==Calculating fixed odds==
It is customary with fixed-odds gambling to know the odds at the time of the placement of the wager (the "live price"), but the category also includes wagers whose price is determined only when the race or game starts (the "[[starting prices]]"). It is ideal for bookmakers to price/mark up a book such that the net outcome will always be in their favour: the sum of the probabilities quoted for all possible outcomes will be in excess of 100%. The excess over 100% (or [[Mathematics of bookmaking|overround]]) represents profit to the bookmaker in the event of a balanced/even book. In the more usual case of an imbalanced book, the bookmaker may have to pay out more winnings than what is staked or may earn more than mathematically expected. An imbalanced book may arise since there is no way for a bookmaker to know the true probabilities for the outcome of competitions left to human effort or to predict the bets that will be attracted from others by fixed odds compiled on the basis personal view and knowledge.

With the advent of Internet and [[bet exchange]] betting, the possibility of fixed-odds [[arbitrage]] actions and [[Dutch book]]s against bookmakers and exchanges has expanded significantly. Betting exchanges in particular act like a [[stock exchange]], allowing the odds to be set in the course of trading between individual bettors, usually leading to quoted odds that are reasonably close to the "true odds."

In making a bet where the expected value is positive, one is said to be getting "the best of it". For example, if one were to bet $1 at 10 to 1 odds (one could win $10) on the outcome of a coin flip, one would be getting "the best of it" and should always make the bet (assuming a rational and risk-neutral attitude with linear [[utility curve]]s and have no preferences implying [[loss aversion]] or the like). However, if someone offered odds of 10 to 1 that a card chosen at random from a regular 52 card deck would be the ace of spades, one would be getting "the worst of it" because the chance is only 1 in 52 that the ace will be chosen.

In an entry for ''[[Encyclopédie|L'Encyclopédie]]'' (the Enlightenment-era "French Encyclopedia"), [[Denis Diderot]] cites a similar example in which two players, Player A and Player B, wager over a game of dice that involves rolling two six-sided dice. Player A wins if the dice add up to 12, of which there is only one possible case. Player B wins if the dice fall in any other combination, of which there are 35 possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0001.120 | title=Wager | publisher=University of Michigan Library | accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mathematically disadvantageous to make a bet if one gets"the worst of it."  Accordingly, for the bet to be "fair," the amount each player could potentially lose or gain from the wager should be adjusted, depending on the odds of their success.

When making a bet in which one must put more at risk than one can win, one is ''laying the odds'' or ''laying the bet''; rational bettors will do so only if the actual chances of an adverse outcome are low enough that the expected outcome even after deduction of taxes and any [[transaction costs]] is favorable to the person laying the bet.  For example, if one bets $1000 that it will rain (or not rain) tomorrow and can win only $200 but can lose the entire $1000, one is laying a bet.  The phrase "[I would bet] dollars to doughnuts [that a given event will or will not occur]," coined in an era when one dollar could purchase numerous doughnuts{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}, thus indicates one's high subjective confidence, or at least one's desire to be perceived as having that confidence, in the outcome that one predicts.

It is possible to be getting "the best of it" or "the worst of it" during lay a bet; laying a bet does not necessarily mean getting "the worst of it". A lay bet is a bet that something will not happen so laying $50 on a horse is betting the horse will not win.

==Types of odds offered==
There are three widely used means of quoting odds:

===Fractional odds===
Favoured by [[bookmaker]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] and common in [[horse racing]], fractional odds quote the net total that will be paid out to the winning bettor relative to the stake.  The term "fractional odds" is something of a misnomer, especially when visually reinforced by using a slash (as opposed to, ''e.g.'', a colon or the word "to" or "on") to separate a potential gain from the amount that a bettor must wager in order to receive it upon a win, because the "fraction" in question represents not the odds of winning or even the reciprocal of the odds of winning but rather the fraction (for any odds longer than "even money" or chances of winning less than 50%, an [[improper fraction]]) of the amount at stake that the upside outcome represents.  This fraction may be derived by subtracting 1 from the reciprocal of the chances of winning; for any odds longer than "even money," this fraction will be an [[Improper fraction|improper]] one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/2994/betting/2011/01/10/2101368/betting-school-understanding-fractional-decimal-betting-odds | title=Betting School: Understanding Fractional &amp; Decimal Betting Odds | publisher=Goal | date=10 January 2011 | accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cortis&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Cortis |first1=Dominic |title=Expected Values and variance in bookmaker payouts: A Theoretical Approach towards setting limits on odds |url=http://ubplj.org/index.php/jpm/article/view/987/968 |accessdate= |year=2015 |publisher= |volume=9 |series=1 |journal= Journal of Prediction Markets |location= |isbn= |page= |section=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odds of 4:1 ("four-to-one" or less commonly "four-to-one ''against''") would imply that the bettor stands to make a £400 profit on a £100 stake.  If the odds are 1:4 (read "one-to-four", or alternatively "four-to-one ''on''" or "four-to-one ''in favor''"), the bettor stands to make £25 on a £100 stake. In either case, ''against'' or ''on'', should he win, the bettor always receives his original stake back, so if the odds are 4:1 the bettor receives a total of £500 (£400 plus the original £100). Odds of 1/1 are known as ''evens'' or ''even money''.

Not all fractional odds are traditionally read using the [[lowest common denominator]].  Perhaps most unusual is that odds of 10:3 are read as "one-hundred-to-thirty".

Fractional odds are also known as ''British odds,'' ''UK odds,''&lt;ref name=wbx /&gt; or, in that country, ''traditional odds.''

===Decimal odds===
Favoured in [[Continental Europe]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]], decimal odds differ from fractional odds by taking into account that the bettor must first part with their stake to make a bet; the figure quoted, therefore, is the winning amount that would be paid out to the bettor.&lt;ref name="cortis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.topbettingreviews.com/fixed-odds-and-due-column-betting/ | title=What is Fixed odds betting and Due Column betting? | publisher=TBR | accessdate=27 March 2014 | author=D., Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the decimal odds of an outcome are equivalent to one plus the decimal value of the fractional odds; in the absence of built-in house advantage to cover overhead, profit margins, or (for an illegal enterprise) compensation for the fact that both chances of prosecution and penalties in the event of conviction tend to be higher for bookmakers than for clients, the decimal odds associated with a given outcome would be the decimal expression of the reciprocal of what the offering party assesses to be the outcome's chance of occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fractional Odds |url=http://betstarter.com/sportsbetting/Fractionalodds.asp#3 |work=betstarter.com/ |accessdate=27 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402082613/http://betstarter.com/SportsBetting/FractionalOdds.asp/ |archivedate=April 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, even odds 1/1 are quoted in decimal odds as 2. The 4/1 fractional odds discussed above are quoted as 5, while the 1/4 odds are quoted as 1.25. It is considered to be ideal for [[Parlay (gambling)|parlay]] betting because the odds to be paid out are simply the product of the odds for each outcome wagered on.

Decimal odds are also known as ''European odds'', ''digital odds'' or ''continental odds'' and tend to be favoured by [[betting exchanges]] because they are the easiest to work with for trading, in this case the purchase and sale of upside and downside risk.&lt;ref name=wbx&gt;{{cite web|title=Betting Odds Format |url=https://m.wbx.com/Help.aspx?IC=50176&amp;S=&amp;ID=20012 |publisher=World Bet Exchange |accessdate=27 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502002250/https://m.wbx.com/Help.aspx?IC=50176&amp;S=&amp;ID=20012 |archivedate=May 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moneyline odds===
Moneyline odds are favoured by [[United States]] bookmakers and as such are sometimes called ''American Odds''.&lt;ref name="cortis" /&gt;  There are two possibilities: the figure quote can be either positive or negative. Moneyline refers to odds on the straight-up outcome of a game with no consideration to a [[spread betting|point spread]].

;Positive figures
:If the figure quoted is positive, the odds are quoting how much money will be won on a $100 wager (done if the odds are better than even). Fractional odds of 4/1 would be quoted as +400 while fractional odds of 1/4 cannot be quoted as a positive figure.

;Negative figures
:If the figure quoted is negative, the moneyline odds are quoting how much money must be wagered to win $100 (this is done if the odds are worse than even). Fractional odds of 1/4 would be quoted as −400 while fractional odds of 4/1 cannot be quoted as a negative figure.

;Even odds
:Even odds are quoted as +100 or −100. Some but not all bookmakers display the positive symbol.

== Odds conversion ==
To convert '''fractional''' odds to decimal, take the fractional number, convert it to decimal by doing the division, and then  add 1. For example, the 4-to-1 fractional odds shown above is the same as 5 in decimal odds, while 1-to-4 would be quoted as 1.25.

The method for converting '''moneyline''' to decimal odds depends on whether the moneyline value is positive or negative. If the moneyline is positive, it is divided by 100 and add 1. Thus, +400 moneyline is the same as 5.0 in decimal odds. If the moneyline is negative, 100 is divided by the absolute moneyline amount (the minus signed is removed), and then 1 is added. For example, −400 moneyline is 100/400&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, or 1.25, in decimal odds.

An '''inflatable arch''' or '''air-inflated arch''' is an [[inflatable structure]] that is inflated by an external cold air inflation fan connected to the arch via a tube. Inflatable arches are customarily 10' to 20' high and 15’ to 30’ wide when inflated and often used as entrances to events or as ad space and mile markers for races. Multiple design capability make the arch a very versatile component for multiple event and promotional initiatives. Some of the more popular designs include the tube arch and the block arch both of which can be further customized with three-dimensional protrusions, digital print log art and temporary banner areas. 

Inflatable arches are commonly used by professional and amateur sports teams and organizations. Their use started becoming more prominent in the 1980s. The Tour de France utilizes inflatable arches in their event while the 70’ long player introduction tunnel used at several modern day Super Bowls is actually an extension of the first inflatable team arch used by the Indianapolis Colts in 1998. Many [[NFL]] teams use an inflatable arch for pre game fan fest activities.

'''''Kid Galahad''''' is a 1962 American musical film starring [[Elvis Presley]] as a [[boxing|boxer]]. It was released by [[United Artists]]. The film opened at #9 at the box office when released in the United States in August 1962. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' ranked it #37 on the list of the top-grossing films of 1962.

''Kid Galahad'' was shot on location in [[Idyllwild, California]]. Its supporting cast included [[Gig Young]], [[Lola Albright]] and [[Charles Bronson]]. Some critics rate it as one of Elvis Presley's best performances.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The film is a [[remake]] of the 1937 [[Kid Galahad (1937 film)|original version]] starring [[Edward G. Robinson]], [[Bette Davis]], and [[Humphrey Bogart]] and directed by [[Michael Curtiz]], who also directed the Presley 1958 film ''[[King Creole]]''.

==Plot==
Willy Grogan is a small-time boxing promoter based in the [[Catskills]] resort region of Cream Valley, [[New York (state)|New York]]. He owns the Grogan's Gaelic Gardens inn. He is a contemptible man and is in debt and pays little attention to the woman who loves him, Dolly, a chain-smoking, love-starved woman residing at the camp. Into their midst comes Walter Gulick, a young man recently discharged from the Army who loves the peaceful setting almost as much as he loves working on old cars. Walter's simple goal is to go into business as a mechanic at a nearby garage.

Willy's younger sister, Rose, shows up unexpectedly. She and Walter immediately hit it off. The obsessively protective Willy doesn't want his kid sister falling for some "grease monkey" mechanic and two-bit boxer. Dolly is envious of the young couple's romance and resents Willy's interference.

One day, Walter, in need of work, accepts an offer of five dollars to be a sparring partner and decks one of Willy's top fighters. Willy is persuaded to let this "Galahad" take a shot in a legitimate ring. Both men are reluctant, but each has a need for the money. Walter begins working out under the watchful eye of Willy's top trainer, Lew.

After several successes in the ring, Walter is readied for his biggest fight. Gangsters want him to take a dive so that Willy can pay off his debts to them, but "Galahad" throws his muscle behind Willy and emerges victorious. He wins the big fight against Ramon "Sugar Boy" Romero as well as Willy's approval, retiring undefeated to his vintage car and his new love.

==Background==
For this role Presley was tutored in the arts of [[Boxing|pugilism]] by former world junior welterweight champ [[Mushy Callahan]], who appeared in the film as a referee.  Callahan actually had a three-decade career as a professional boxing referee after retiring from the ring as a fighter.  According to Callahan, in a December 1962 Associated Press news story, in all the close-up scenes when Presley is being struck in the face by punches, it is Callahan who was throwing them.  He taught Presley how to move his head backwards as the punches were being delivered so that each blow either missed him or barely touched him.  The story further said that Callahan considered Presley to be an excellent athlete. 

&lt;ref name=Enc284&gt;Victor, p.284&lt;/ref&gt; Reigning welterweight champion Orlando De La Fuente also appeared as Ramon "Sugar Boy" Romero. Shooting began in early November 1961 in Hidden Lodge, Idyllwild, California, before a storm forced a move to Hollywood. Of the people who starred in this film, [[Gig Young]] made a dramatic appearance while doing other roles: later he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in the 1969 film [[They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (film)|''They Shoot Horses, Don't They?'']].

==Reception==
[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that Presley was miscast as a boxer, writing that he was "certainly no model for a statue of Hercules, and his skill at projecting an illusion of ferocity is of very low degree." Nevertheless, he found the film to be "moderately genial entertainment. It's not explosive, but it has the cheerful top of a lightly romantic contrivance that ranges between comedy and spoof. For this we can thank the other actors who played their roles ardently and Phil Karlson, who has directed at a brisk and deceptive pace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=March 7, 1963 |title=Screen: A Ferocious Elvis Presley |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' graded the film as "Good" and echoed Crowther's review in writing that "Presley is surrounded by some very nice people. In lending him support, they give strength to a run-of-the-mill story that plays itself out with a simplicity of appeal and bountiful residue of entertainment. The film manages to give a pleasing account of itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=July 28, 1962 |title=Film review: Kid Galahad |journal=[[Harrison's Reports]] |page=115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A less positive notice in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' read, ""The story may be old, the direction not especially perceptive, the performances in several cases pretty poor, but United Artists' 'Kid Galahad' is apt to be a moneymaker in spite of all this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=June 25, 1962 |title=Kid Galahad |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; John L. Scott in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the story "old hat" but thought it "should more than satisfy the horde of Presley fans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=John L. |date=August 31, 1962 |title=Presley Plays Boxing Hero in 'Kid Galahad' |journal=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=Part IV, p. 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote, ""If the wit and intelligence lavished on the excellent dialogue had also been used to give a shred of ingenuity to the plot or a momentary sparkle to the lyrics, this would have been a much more amusing comedy ... Elvis Presley repeats the amiable oaf performance he gave recently in ''[[Follow That Dream]]'', but it is nowhere near as funny, partly because his farcical opportunities are fewer, but mainly because it is hard to laugh continually at someone whose face is seen a couple of times bruised and bleeding in the ring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=November 1962 |title=Kid Galahad |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |page=155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="58969">[[Capoeira]] has always been an eclectic martial art with a variety of different techniques that make use of the hands, feet, legs, arms, elbows, knees, and head.  Some techniques are used for moving along the ground while others are used for evading attacks and it is not uncommon to see a combination of the two.  There are hard attacks that include [[headbutts]], slaps, punches, elbows, kicks and knees as well as softer attacks such as [[takedown (grappling)|takedowns]] or sweeps; however, the main emphasis is normally placed on the interaction between kicks and evasions.  The most confusing group of techniques for many outside the capoeira circle are florieos which often results in capoeira being mistaken for [[breakdancing]] or [[acrobatics]].

A huge synergy of West African martial arts, cultures, and traditions such as Hausa [[Dambe]], [[kulunga]] fighting, and [[Nuba]] wrestling have all had an influence on capoeira techniques.&lt;ref name=Heywood&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heywood|first1=Linda|title=Central Africans and cultural transformations in the American diaspora|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0521002783}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These combined with the colorful acrobatic performances during the festivals all came together to form the capoeira that many are familiar with today. A large amount of these same techniques can be found in other martial arts from the African Diaspora such as ''knocking and kicking'' from the [[Sea Islands]], ''ladya'' from [[Martinique]]  or [[juego de mani]] from Cuba. There are also many techniques in capoeira found in  more well-known Asian martial arts.

During the end of slavery and beginning of the formation of different gangs or ''maltas'', weapons such as clubs, [[straight razors]], machetes, among others were used by many capoeiristas. With the exception of machetes used during machulele performances, most capoeiristas no longer train with weapons.

It is important to note that for historical reasons, different groups often use different names for the same techniques, and even the same name for different techniques.  Some capoeira groups prefer to preserve the traditional techniques while other seek to evolve.

==Movement==

===Ginga ===
[[File:Ginga de dos.gif|left|thumb|180px|Animation of ginga movement]]

The ''ginga'' (pronounced ''jeen-gah''; literally: ''rocking back and forth''; ''to swing'') is the fundamental footwork of capoeira.  Its constant triangular [[footwork (martial arts)|footwork]] makes capoeira easily recognizable as well as confusing since it looks much more like a rhythmic dance step than an orthodox static fighting stance. Only a few martial arts employ similar rhythmic footwork found in the ginga. [[Korea|South Korea's]]  [[Taekkyeon]] and some forms for [[Pencak Silat]] are a few others.

The main purpose is not dancing but rather to prepare the body for any number of movements such as evading, feinting, or delivering attacks while continuously shifting stances all while providing confusion. The ginga places the capoeirista in constant motion, making them a frustrating target for a forward-advancing opponent,.&lt;ref name="nestor2003" /&gt;  The ginga also allows the capoeirista to continuously maintain enough torque to use in a strike while providing a [[synchronization]] of arm movement to avoid and slip under attacks. The ginga is not static so its speed is usually determined by the ''toque'' or rhythm dictated by the ''[[bateria]]''.

[[Capoeira Angola]] and [[capoeira regional]] both have distinctive versions of this movement. In Capoeira Angola, the ginga is more expressive and individualistic, while in Capoeira Regional the ginga has a more structured and defensive look. Most Capoeira regional academies teach the ginga in the same way until the student advances to a certain level and begins to develop their own expressive and comfortable way of using it.&lt;ref name="nestor2003"&gt;{{Cite book

===Cadeira===
[[File:Parlelo.JPG|thumb|Paralelo]]
The cadeira or ''paralelo'' is a low squat that shares many similarities with the [[horse stance]] found in Eastern martial arts.   One arm protects the face while the other is extended out protecting the torso.  Every time a capoeirista brings his feet parallel during a ginga, he enters this position.

===Aú===

The [[capoeira]] term for what is more generally known as a [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheel]]. It differs a bit from the traditional cartwheel because of their different intentions. An aú, in its base form, is performed very slowly, with arms and legs bent in order to keep a low target profile. Players sometime pause midway during an aú holding it for a [handstand] position, from which they can execute a wide variety of moves.

There is always the existing risk of receiving a low headbutt, front push kick, or some other attack while inverted.  To combat this an emphasis is placed on closely watching the movements and intentions of the other player instead of the ground. While the main purpose of using the aú is more geared towards mobility and evasion there are still more ingenious variations of employing it.  Capoeira players can incorporate unpredictable strikes as well as floeiros from the aú.  These include inverted kicks as well as jumping movements that do not involve the hand.

*'''Aú Aberto'''—From [[#Esquiva|esquiva]], the free arm reaches in an arc over the head in the direction of motion. The leg extended furthest from the body leaves the ground first, kicking off and providing momentum. Then the reaching hand is placed on the far side of the body. Bending the arms at the elbows supports weight as both legs pass over the body fully extended. While inverted, the body should be opened and entirely extended. One foot touches the ground then the other. The arms must be lifted for protection as soon as they are no longer supporting weight.
*'''Aú Batido'''—The ''aú batido'' is an aú variation where a practitioner does a handstand, followed by a twist with the hips and a split, performing a downward [[martelo]]. During the kick, one arm is protecting the face while the other one is obviously supporting the body. Aú batido literally means "broken cartwheel". This movement is a defensive move, used when attempting to perform a cartwheel and the opponent attacks, generally with a [[#Cabeçada|cabeçada]], a headbutt, the aú batido takes place, attacking the opponent by surprise before the attack is executed. The aú batido is sometimes also used in doubt or simply as a trick move. This move is also performed in tricking, and for quality, it is also used often in [[Breakdance|breakdancing]] where it is known as the [[L-kick]]. Names used in different schools may also include ''Beija Flor'' (Humming Bird, literally Flower Kiss(er)), ''Leque'' (Fan), ''Aú Québrado'' (also "broken cartwheel"), ''Aú Malandro''(wily cartwheel), ''Aú Amazonas'' (Amazon cartwheel) or ''Amazonica''.
** '''Aú Batendo'''-A similar technique, except that the hands generally stay on the ground and the cartwheel is not stopped during the kick, but rather continues over.
*'''Aú Fechado'''—From [[#Esquiva|esquiva]] or [[#Negativa|negativa]], the free arm reaches in an arc over the head in the direction of motion. The leg extended furthest from the body leaves the ground first, kicking off and providing momentum. Then the reaching hand is placed on the far side of the body. Bending the arms at the elbows supports weight as both legs pass bent in front of and slightly over the body. While inverted, the body should be closed and maximally protected. One foot touches the ground and then the other. The last step is return to esquiva.
*'''Aú sem Mão'''—An aú performed without hands in the same manner as the [[aerial cartwheel]].  It can be inverted more diagonally to attack in the same way as a [[butterfly kick]] or it be used as a floreio.
*'''Au de Frente'''
Also known as ''volta ao mundo'' or ''au cortado''.
The '''au de frente''' starts much like a regular Aú, but once the legs are off the floor, the hips are turned and the move ends in a [[front walkover]].

*'''Aú Giro Sem Mâo'''
The au giro sem mâo aka ''piao sem mao''  combines the motions of an au de frente with those of an [[Aerial cartwheel|aerial]]. 
The au giro sem mâo starts just like Au sem mâo, but once the player jumps off with their leg, the opposite arm is driven around and towards the chest to create enough torque for the rotation.
The advanced variation is the Au sem mao de frente which is literally a front walkover without hands.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Balanço===
The balanço of side to side [[feint]]s done with the torso to deceive the opponent, throw off their timing, and make it harder for them to track the [[Wing Chun#Centerline|centerline]].  In a similar manner as a speedskater, the bodyweight is shifted from one leg to the other in a slight [[wikt:lateral|lateral]] hopping/sliding motion while the arms move in a similar fashion as they do during the ginga.  The balanço is usually done from the forward [[#Ginga|ginga]] and is  also known as the ''Cavalo''.  As with other movements in capoeira, all types of kicks, handstrikes, or headbutts can be executed unexpectedly from the movement.

*'''Pêndulo'''
The pêndulo resembles more the [[slipping]] and [[Bobbing (boxing)|bobbing]].  Whereas the balanço moves side to side, the [[s://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46HsfbXYTQ|pendulo]] is used more to roll and move under attacks.
Most of the movement starts from the upper body but also includes dropping with the knees. When the arms are used while the upper body follows the same path as the letter C.  The move works really well with incoming fast or direct attacks.

===Bananeira===
The bananeira is a [[handstand]] in capoeira that derives its name from the [[banana]] trees of [[Brazil]].  The hands are spread at least shoulder-width apart and the legs are usually together over the capoerista's head.  Other variations include having the legs split apart to the side or front.  One outlying difference the bananeira has in capoeira is that the face and eyes of the capoeirista are towards the other player; not the ground. While in Bananeira, the feet can be used to defend as well as attack. The bananeira's other uses can be to take a quick break and observe the other player, draw an opponent into a trap, or in the case of contemporary regional schools, show off balance and strength as a floreio. The bananeira is thought to have originated from the use of the handstand by an [[Nganga]] (Bantu healers and spiritual leaders) by showing their spiritual connection to the ancestors who walk on their hands in the spirit world.

===Macaco===
The [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwWKvLzSU9c ''macaco''] is similar to a [[back handspring]] with the exception of starting with one hand planted behind the capoeirista and the initial movement starting from a low crouch.  The macaco begins by lowering the body down into a low crouch and placing one hand on the floor directly behind the back making contact with the ground.  The other hand is thrown over the body while jumping off with both feet to launch the [[hips]] straight over the head. This back sweeping movement mirrors the motion that a swimmer adopts when performing a  [[backstroke]]. As the capoeirista passes into a handstand position, the second hand is placed onto the ground before bringing the first foot makes contact with the ground. The macaco shares visual similarities with the  [[Valdez handspring|valdez]].  Variations can include beginning and finishing with the first arm and/or landing with both feet simultaneously. The move is commonly known as the jump of the monkey as the word ''Macaco'' literally translates to monkey.

*'''Macaquinho'''
This movement is very similar to the macaco with the exception being that it is lower and less explosive.  The knees are in a more forward bent position while one arm is placed directly behind the balls of the feet.  Instead of jumping as with the ''macaco'', the capoeirista lowers his/her [[Abdominal external oblique muscle|external oblique]] onto his elbow and brings his other arm and legs over his head.  The [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOCoFaHrUfc macaquinho], translating to little monkey, is a combination of a macaco and queda de rins.
*'''Macaco em Pé'''
[[File:Macaco em pe.gif|thumb|Macaco em pe]]
This is a macaco that is done without a hop or crouch.  The ''macaco em pé'' resembles the combined motions of a [[back walkover]] and a [[cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheel]].  Instead of crouching and jumping, the capoeirista falls backwards onto one arm while bending his back and allowing his hips to go over his head while moving into a standard macaco motion.
*'''Macaco Lateral'''
This is also known as a ''Xango''.  It is a standard [[back handspring]].  Instead of placing one hand on the ground and flipping over, a leap is made backwards in an arch while extending the hands over the head.  This move is used more for entering the roda.

===Negativa===
[[File:Negativa da regional2.jpg|thumb|Negativa da Regional]] lit. ''negative, refusal or deny''. a negativa is used to negate an attack by going low to the ground on one's side, with the leg closest to the ground tucked to the chest, the other extended, supporting one's body weight with the hand, with the upper arm in a location to protect the face. The '''''negativa derrubando''''' used as a sweep which involves hooking the other players supporting leg during a  kick.

[[File:Negativa.jpg|thumb|Negativa]]

===Rolê===
Rolê: This 'rolling' motion is - together with the Ginga and the Au - the basic method of moving around in the Roda. This move can be performed from Ginga or from most of the esquivas. It is essentially a spin to one side by the capoeirista while remaining low to the ground and always watching the other player. One of the hallmarks of the move is that during the part where the back is facing the opponent, eye contact is maintained via looking between the legs to watch for an attack. The rolê can end easily in roxana, Negativa, or various esquivas. The Rolê de Cabeça variation is performed by placing the head on the ground in the middle of the rolê so as to be able to transition into various headstand techniques.

===Troca de Pé===
Literally ''Change of Foot,'' From a Negativa position with the leg extended, a slight hop during which the extended leg becomes the support leg and the guard arm becomes the support arm and vice versa.

===Ponte===
The ponte is a [[bridge (exercise)|bridge]] with the stomach facing upward and the hands and feet pushing to keep the back arched and off the floor.  Most learn to roll into a ponte by turning their legs and hips around first and then inverting into a bridge.  The capoeirista can then roll out into a cocorinha, queda de rins, or resistincia for a stylish entrance into a roda.  The ponte also doubles as a last resort esquiva although that depends on the player's skill level, style, and speed of the game.  Another interesting fact is that [[Mestre Bimba]] would give a potential student (aluno) a series of tests before actually teaching them at his academy.  One of the tests was a measure of the applicant's natural ability to hold a [[bridge (exercise)|bridge]]

===Queda de Rins===
The queda de rins (fall on the kidneys) can be used as an esquiva or a launching point for a technique. It involves supporting the torso with the inside elbow and the head, often with the knees resting on the supporting elbow.  The head is usually the lowest with the feet and at the highest in a rough 45° angle. The legs themselves may be together, tuck, split depending on the position.

==Defensive movements==

===Cocorinha===
One of the simplest defense movements. With the feet flat on the ground the player squats with the knees to the chest so as to close the body and covers the side of the torso and head with one hand while the other is flat and to the side for support.

Another variation of this involves [[squatting position|squatting]] with the balls of the feet on the ground and arms crossed in front and above the face.

===Esquiva===
Literally ''escape'' or ''dodge''. Many forms exist but all involve moving the head and torso out of the way of an attack.  Esquivas distinguish capoeira from many other martial arts for the simple fact of going along with flow of the attack and releasing an equal or more devastating attack.  Many of the attacks in capoeira are fully committed kicks that would cause more injury blocking them instead of dodging them.  Blocking attacks upset and imbalance the flow of the game making esquivas more common in rodas. Blocks do sometimes occur when one player is so caught off guard that they are used instinctively.  The most common situations being defenses against hand attacks.

*'''Esquiva Baixa'''
Also known as Esquiva de Frente."Low dodge", this has the looks of an extremely low ginga. The rear leg and foot are exaggerated and placed even farther back to bring the hips lower to the ground. The torso is bent forward bringing the head even lower.  If the left foot is back then the right hand is placed on the floor; the left hand is used to guard the face and head.

*'''Esquiva Lateral'''
"Side escape" or ''side dodge''. It is executed while the feet are in a parallel position. The escape is simply bringing the torso down and to the left or right (depending on the direction of the other player's kick) and reaching the hand over the head  The hand can also be placed in front of the face for protection. Some academies will place the hand that is not guarding onto the floor to get even lower.

*'''Esquiva Diagonal'''
This is a dodge that simultaneously dodges and advances forward.  Instead of going straight down under an attack or off to the side like in the esquiva lateral or esquiva de frente, the capoeirista steps diagonally of to the left or right of the attack.  He/she places his front foot in a [[perpendicular]] position to his back foot and crouches down at the knees in a low [[lunge (exercise)|lunge]].  The left or right arm comes up to protect the face depending on the direction of the attack while the other arm maintains the body’s balance.   This is a quite useful esquiva because many counterattacks are available to the player from this position which can include martelos, ganchos, or vingativas saving valuable time.

===Queda de Quatro===
[[Image:CapoeiraMeialuaDeCompasso&amp;QuedaDeQuatro ST 05.jpg|thumb|130px|{right}|One capoeirista uses a queda de quatro to evade a Rabo de Arraia]]
Literally ''fall of four.'' Simply fall backwards into a crab-walk position, often followed by scurrying backwards and away from the opponent.

===Queda de Tres===
Falling back onto the wrists and one leg. The other leg is up because this position is often "forced" when the player is taken down from being supported on a single leg. For example: sweeping the base leg of armada leads the fallen player to, hopefully, end in this position.

==Kicks==

===Armada===

An ''armada'' is a [[Kick#Reverse roundhouse kick/heel kick|reverse roundhouse kick]], also described as a spinning inside to outside crescent kick. It can be either a Rabo-de-Arraia without the hands supporting on the floor  (the head falls below the waist and the kick is executed with the heel), or a Meia lua de Costas (halfmoon from the back),  a spinning kick with the body upright.
The striking surface is usually the outside blade of the kicking foot. A queixada and armada are executed in exactly the same way with the exception of the armada beginning with a step to the right or left before releasing the kick.  The power of the armada actually comes from the torque placed on the hips from the spin.

After stepping across the body (to the right or left) at around 45 degrees, the hips are spun while the arms are up to protect from punches or other kicks.  Once there is enough torque, the kicking leg is "released" rather than kicked.  This leg goes around in the same motion as a queixada until the kicking leg has finished its arc all the way back or parallel to the other foot.

*'''Armada Pulada'''
An Armada that is released after a jump.  The armada pulada begins the same way as the regular armada with the capoeirista turning to the left or right.  Once the head, neck and shoulders rotate towards the front, he/she jumps during the release of the armada making it a spinning aerial kick.

*'''Armada Dupla'''
Also known as an '''''Envergado'''''. The distinguishing feature of this move is the fact that both legs remain together during the take off, execution, and landing.  Its name, Armada dupla, is derived from this feature and also literally means "double armada". After the take off, the torso stays upright and vertical, but will begin to quickly torque in order to swing the legs around and upwards. At the peak of this move, the body is in the shape of a "V". The legs continue to swing over as the body straightens out for the landing. In tricking, this move is called a [[Double Leg (trick)|double leg]].  Along with the Meia Lua Compasso and Au Malandro/Batida, the armada dupla one of the trademark kicks unique to the art capoeira.

*'''Armada com Martelo'''
The armada com martelo is a spinning double kick beginning with an armada pulada and finishing with a martelo.  The capoeirista begins with the same motion of the Armada.  While the first leg is raised up, he/she jumps off their back leg.  Once the first leg completes its arc, the leg that was jumped off of comes around in the form of a jumping martelo rotado.

===Bênção===
[[Image:CapoeiraBencao ST 05.jpg|thumb|130px|{right}|An esquiva under a Bênção]]

Literally "blessing". It is a straight forward frontal push kick. It is commonly aimed at the abdominal or chest area, and the capoeirista hits with either the whole sole of the foot or with the heel.  The level of impact varies with its range and intent from a soft tap to an inward jumping stomp to the head, or [[torso]].

===Chapa===
Chapa, the sole of the foot, is a generic term for various straight kicks with the sole or heel of the foot.  This kick can be used in a roda to push away the other player for distance. These include:

*'''Chapa-de-Costas
It resembles a kick from a horse or mule in which both hands are usually on the ground while one of the legs is pushed outward towards the other player.  It is a clever attack that can be delivered out of a role towards the [[groin]] or [[knee]] of the other player.

*'''Chapa-de-Frente
A straight kick facing the opponent sometimes performed from a Queda de Quatro, pushing with the hips to gain greater extension. It has the look of a Bençao given from a Queda de Quatro.

*'''Pisào
Another variation being a side kick. First the player begins by lifting the knee of the kicking leg and hip level of the support leg. The capoeirista turns his supporting foot 180 degrees to the rear while thrusting the kicking foot towards the other player's body.

*'''Chapa Baixa
This is a side kick to the lower areas including the thigh, knee, or [[instep]].  Impact is usually made with the heel or sole of the foot.  As with the pisào, the chapa baixa begins with a forward knee raise.  However, instead of rising upwards towards the usual kicking targets capoeira (head, chest, stomach), the kick is driven downward towards the other player's lower extremities.  It incorporates the malacia in capoeira appearing as a high kick but ending in an unpredictable painful kick to the knee or thigh.  In most rodas this is shown rather than completed to full extension. During the later rounds of his title defense in [[UFC 97]] with Thales Leites, [[Anderson Silva]] made extensive use of this technique.

*'''Chapa Giratoria
[[File:Chapa Giratoria.gif|thumb|Chapa Giratoria]]
Capoeira’s answer for the sole kick.  It is done is the same way as '''''ban dae yeop chagi''''' in [[Taekwondo]] with the capoeirista stepping forward or diagonally while turning his torso.  At the same time he raises his back leg up, unleashing it at the apex of the turn in a straight path.

===Escorpião===
[[File:Capoeira Scorpion kick.gif|thumb|Scorpion kick]]
There are actually two different versions of the escorpião.  The attacking one is very similar to the scorpion kick of other martial arts. It is characterized by kicking backwards, over the head, at a target in front of the kicker impacting with the sole or heel of the foot. The escorpião is very hard to see and is extremely dangerous in the hands of a master.

===Gancho===
The ''gancho'' lit. hook, is a [[hook kick]]. It is a deceptive attack that starts off in the same way as a martelo or [[roundhouse kick]].  The knee and thigh of the kicking leg is brought up and across the body in a diagonal direction.  Instead of thrusting in and out like a chapa, the leg is extended toward the body and thrust out in a hooking motion striking with the heel or sole.  The path of the heel ends near the buttocks and [[hamstring]] as it is brought down.  There are other ways of using it such as fake martelos into in or from fake chapas.  Because of its deceptiveness, the name gancho is perfect for it since it can sometimes act as the hook for a bait attack that is seen far too late.

*'''Gancho Giratoria'''
A spinning version of the gancho.  It starts out like a spinning chapa but deceptively lashes out and hooks around in the same manner as the gancho.

===Martelo===
The martelo, which literally means "hammer", is generally defined as a strike with the [[instep]], or lower part of the [[shinbone|shin]] against the opponent's body; the most common target is [[Temple (anatomy)|temple]] of the head. The most common forms of the Martelo include:

*'''Martelo em Pé
[[File:Martelo em Pe.gif|thumb|Martelo em Pe]]
This is the most common martelo seen in ''Regional'' and ''Contemporânea'' rodas. Its execution on the very basic level is identical to the sport version of the [[roundhouse kick]] commonly seen in Tae Kwon Do and kickboxing.  Capoeira emphasizes using kicks anywhere at any time so advance forms of the martelo em pe can come from fakes, skipping and kicking with the front leg, and from other dodges such as the esquiva diagonal.  Emphasis is placed on speed and deception rather than knockout.  Even with this precaution knockouts still occur due to the weight and sheer force of the leg.

*'''Martelo do Chão'''
[[File:Martelo do Chao.gif|thumb|Martelo do Chao]]
It is a martelo that starts from the ground.  The Martelo do Chão is delivered from a lower position usually right before a rolé while in esquiva baixa or downward going into a queda de rins.

*'''Martelo de Negativa'''
[[File:S Batido.gif|thumb|Martelo de Negativa]]
This is a variation of blends the movements of s dobrado with martelo do chão.  The martelo de negativa begins with a hop generating more force since the entire body is used. Other names include ''chapéu de couro'' and ''s batida''.

*'''Martelo Rotado'''
A spinning martelo, similar to a [[540 kick]]. The martelo rotado combines the 540 or parafuso with a martelo.  Whereas the parafuso is a spinning outside to inside crescent, the martelo rotado impacts with the instep.   Control is sacrificed for power as the leg does not stop, but follows through with a full rotation of the hips.

===Meia Lua de Compasso===
{{main article|Meia lua de compasso}}
The ''Meia-Lua de compasso'' (''lit: compass half moon'') aka. ''rabo do arria'', is an attack that embodies the true element of [[Capoeira]] since it combines an evasive maneuver with a spinning kick.  The transfer of power begins with the hand slamming into the ground and ending with the spin of the kicking heel.  The power of the kick derives its energy from the similar [[centripetal force]] of a golf club swing. It has earned its place in capoeira as being called the "king of kicks".  There is even a saying among capoeira mestres on how a capoeirista's general skill level can be determined on how well and fast they are able to execute a Meia lua de compasso.

===Meia-lua de Frente===
Meia Lua de Frente (Front Half Moon) is an outside-inside crescent kick seen in other [[martial arts]].  This kick involves using the hips to generate enough force to bring the foot of the kicking leg across the face of the player.  While it can be used as an attack itself, it mainly is used as a poke or trap for another attack. Other uses for it can be as a combination with [[cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheels]] and other acrobatic moves, therefore, working as an escape.

===Ponteira===
Ponteira is the simple front snap-kick with the ball of the foot. It is performed by lifting the knee and quickly extending the leg with toes pulled back while tilting the torso slightly backwards to strike the opponent in the abdomen, chest or face. Contrary to the Benção this is intended as a hard and fast striking kick.

===Queixada===
This is one of the most commonly used of the basic kicks in contemporary regional.  To execute with the right leg, one begins in mid-ginga stance, with the left leg back and the right forward.  From this position, step slightly to the left with the right leg, shifting body weight onto the forward (right) leg while the body faces left.  Immediately bring the left leg forward, crossing it behind the right while beginning to throw body weight forward to gain momentum.  When the body weight is fully resting on the left leg, release the right leg, kicking it in a large, sweeping arc to the right, keeping the leg straight throughout. When the kick has been completed, the capoeirista is now in mid-ginga stance, except now with the right leg back and the left forward.

Throughout this move one must always remember to guard his or her face using the thick part of the forearms (as is done in all capoeira moves).
Reverse all directions (left-right and vice versa) in order to execute a queixada with the left leg.'''

===Raiz===
A raiz is a type of kick used in contemporary regional. It could be described as a sideswipe with less rotation, so the practitioner lands on the rear leg from the take off instead of the kicking leg. However, in terms of tricking, the raiz is not a kick, but rather an evasive move aimed to avoid an attack toward the legs. The set-up for the raiz is exactly like the 540 kick, but the technique required for a successful raiz is similar to a Double Leg. In starting this move, the practitioner turns slightly sideways at the waist with the arm-swing motion. Once the set-up is accomplished, the first leg is thrown straight up while having the head thrown back. This motion causes the practitioner's back to become parallel to the ground. The first leg travels around like a Double Leg and the second leg trails behind it. The first leg lands first on the ground and the second leg lags behind. The second leg should not be rushed, but rather be relaxed and let it fall by itself.

===S-Dobrado===
The S-Dobrado is the generic name for a series of motions that takes a capoeirista from a low position to whip one leg across the floor in a half circle, then kick up his legs and invert onto his hands and then land back on his feet and stand. The S refers to shape traced by the motion of the leg which leads the move. It is used as a transitional move and there are many variations of the S-Dobrado. A basic S-Dobrado can start from a [[#Negativa|Negativa]], whip the straight leg around in a half circle to face the other direction, kick up into a [[#Macaco|Macaco]]. Another variation involves going from Corta Capim, then kicking up into Macaco. While inverted, the capoeirista can Au, or stop and do a [[#Bananeira|Bananeira]], or even sink down into a [[#Queda de Rins|Queda De Rins]]. It is a very versatile technique for a capoeirista.

===Vôo-do-Morcego===
Literally translated as the "Flight of the bat". This is a flying kick done sideways with both legs.  It is executed virtually in the same manner as a [[dropkick]]; however, the knees are drawn back in after making contact and one lands on their feet.  It would be ridiculous to perform this in the same way as pro wrestlers since landing on the ground would injure the capoeirista more than the kick.  Since it is an aerial attack, balance and control are sacrificed for raw power.  As with any attack, the effectiveness of this attack depends on the timing, weight, and [[body mass]].  It was a very popular attack in past times, but it is rarely seen in rodas today. In the anime series [[Afro Samurai]], Afro utilizes this kick against his opponents in season 2 although it is not specified where he learned this kick.

==Hand and arm strikes==
''Jogo de Braços'' or "the game of the arm and hand".  Traditionally, hand strikes were rarely used in capoeira, the mythological reasoning behind this being that the [[shackles]] and [[chain]]s of the slaves prevented this.  Even if this is so, punches, elbows, and slaps have always existed in street rodas all around [[Brazil]].  Today, this game of the arm and hand is seen more in the Capoeira Angola rodas.  Some players attempt to distract or fascinate their opponent by waving their arms and hands in a spellcasting like way.  This ''jogo'' or game represents a swinging and waving of hands to diminish any perception of an attack and lower the other player's guard.&lt;ref&gt;Nestor Capoeira (2002) ''Roots of the Dance-Fight-Game'', Revised Ed. North Atlantic Books. pg 30 {{ISBN|1-55643-404-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asfixiante===
While the literal translation of this is based on suffocation or rather the act of it, the '''asfixiante''' is a straight [[Cross (boxing)|punch]] thrown with either hand.  Taking clues from its name, the target may have originally been the [[throat]] instead of the face.

===Cutelo===
The Cutelo, also known as Cutilada de Mao, is a [[knifehand strike]] attack.  It is applied in the same way as the generic [[karate]] chop usually to the face, temple, or base of the neck.  The [[:wikt:arc|arc]] of travel for the cutelo usually begins on the outside to inside combining a backhand attack with a knifehand. The cutelo is not as present in rodas as it once was.

===Cotovelada===
The cotovelada is an [[elbow strike]] usually from outside to inside. In all forms of martial arts, range plays a very important role.  When two capoeristas are playing a close aggressive game it would be foolish to throw a kick or punch at such a close range. The cotovelada is a quick surprise attack when things get too close.
Ths strike can really hurt if performed right

===Dedeira===
An attack to the [[Human eyes|eyes]] that reveals the [[street fighting]] origins of capoeira. It is rarely executed in rodas today because of the harm it can cause. It is an [[#Professional wrestling attacks (eyepoke)|eyepoke]] with the index and middle finger of the attacking hand. This attack was usually done to disorientate the target for a quick escape or in some cases, rob them.  In most capoeira rodas, the Dedeira will be shown, but never fully executed. When combined with the element of surprise, the dedeira was a very useful ambush weapon.

===Galopante===
The galopante is more of a slap than a punch. The capoeirista strikes the side of the opponents face or ear with his open hand in a swinging motion. In most cases the galopante is not meant to cause much damage to the opponent. It is instead used as a distraction or to tell the opponent that his guard is too open.  However, it is a handslap that follows the same trajectory and principles of a [[hook punch]] using the body's core making it just as damaging in the right "hands".

===Godeme===
Backhand strike, normally to the face.  The hand can made into a fist making it a [[backfist]] or done openhanded as a slap.  When swinging, the arms are relaxed making the strike faster and the sting more painful. The godeme is obviously an aggressive attack. According to Capoeira lore, the move was named when Mestre Bimba was sparring with some Americans. He was establishing the names they had for various techniques when performed this strike to the head to his partner, who responded with a hearty "God damn!" which Mestre Bimba assumed was their name for it. While the error was explained to him afterwards, he liked the name enough to retain it.

===Telefone===
An attack with both hands slapping the opponent's [[ears]] at the same time. This attack is used rarely in the roda as it is considered too aggressive.  The telefone is very painful and disorienting because of the sudden burst of air pressure entering the [[ear canal]].  It is possible for this attack, if done in a malicious way, to cause permanent damage to the [[eardrum]]. Its name is a use of wordplay based on a [[telephone]] call.

==Head butts==

===Arpão de Cabeça===
This is a [[headbutt]] that involved the capoeirista throwing his full body into the headbutt.  While the ''cabeçda'' can be seen as playful, this is its more violent cousin.  By usually ducking under a kick or punch, the player will spring forward with full force targeting the head, stomach, or [[groin]].

===Cabeçada===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Cabecada.jpg|thumb|180px|Execution of a Cabeçada attacking a cartwheeling opponent]] --&gt;
The ''Cabeçada'' (pronounced: ka-be-SA-da, ''lit.: head butt'') is an offensive movement of [[Capoeira]] in which the attacker pushes the opponent with his head or forehead. Generally a cabeçada is performed when the opponent is executing an open [[Cartwheel (Capoeira)|au]] (cartwheel) but can be performed against any move where the belly of an opponent is exposed. A less playful version of this technique is when instead of the forehead both elbows are pushed into the defender's abdomen. Another variation on this technique involves first entering a push-up like position but with the hips raised the head is then thrust forward into the target. This is usually used when both players are on the ground.   
{{clear}}

===Escorumelo===
This is a less playful [[headbutt]] that moves in an upward direction.  The head goes under the attack and comes up hitting the bottom of the chin.  This gives it the same application as an uppercut combined with the weight of the entire body rising along with the head.

==Takedowns==
Takedowns are normally considered a bit aggressive in capoeira, and attempting a takedown might be seen as a test of one's skills. However, the frequency of takedowns in the roda varies from group to group and type of game. One situation where takedowns are common, is during the Batizado ceremony. This is when the Mestre (Master) gives the new students their first cordão, or the senior students their next cord according to their progression in capoeira. In such a ceremony, the mestre(s) will try to take his students down, sometimes several times during a game.  In the same manner of a baptism of going underwater and emerging a new person, the takedown of a novice is seen as bring them down and them rising as a new baptized capoeirista.

Due to the strong emphasis on kicking, the most common takedowns in capoeira are [[sweeps]]; however, there are also other takedowns utilizing the hands, arms, legs or shoulders to push, lift, or even throw the opponent to the ground.

===Açoite-de-Braço===
This throw is rarely seen.  Its use was a more designed for [[self-defense]].
If an attacker was approaching the capoeirista from behind using a club or cheap [[Punch (strike)|punch]], the capoeirista would duck under the attack simultaneously scooping the leg of the attacker up.  He would continue the motion, the attacker off of his shoulders and slamming him to the ground.  The closest throw to this is the [[kata guruma]] also seen in [[judo]].

The above version is found in the books by Nestor Capoeira; however, in the original Regional style of Mestre Bimba, Acoite de Braco (lit. arm whip) is a shoulder throw similar to [[ippon seoi nage]] in judo – capoeirista grasps one arm of his opponent with both hands, turns around and throws him over the back.

===Arrastão===
Classic leg takedown. The capoeirista grabs the opponent behind the knees and pulls/lifts while pushing the opponent backwards with their shoulder, driving him to the ground.
While seen as a [[double leg takedown]], in many situations it will change to a single leg takedown. Ironically in the evolution of things, this move is usually countered with a [[sprawl (grappling)|sprawl]] or even a [[guillotine choke]] depending on the school or academy.  An alternate technique used by some groups is for the capoeirista to take the opponent down laterally, as opposed to a football-tackle style takedown.  Using their head to push the opponent's hips sideways, forcing the opponent to balance upon one leg, the capoeirista then uses their arms to sweep the remaining leg from underneath the opponent, completing the takedown.  The opponent's legs should be swept so that they land in front of the capoeirista's legs instead of in between, for defensive reasons.  Upon discovery of this takedown, some casual viewers learn to see capoeira as more than a recreational "dance".
[[File:Balao de lado.jpg|thumb|
Balão de Lado
]]

=== Balão de Lado ===
In this takedown, the capoerista wraps the opponent's head with an arm from behind and bends over, lifting the opponent and rotating the body to throw him to the ground. This technique resembles the [[koshi guruma]] taught in [[judo]].

=== Banda ===
Banda is a sweep kick, the objective of which is to pull one of the opponent's feet making him lose his balance and fall.  It usually is performed from a standing position.  What separates the banda from the rasteira is that the sweep is mostly done with the [[heel]] of the foot instead of the [[instep]].

*''' Banda de Costa'''
[[File:Banda de Costa.gif|thumb|Banda de Costa]]
A defensive counter-attack performed against a kick.
This is usually reserved for circular kicks such as the ''armada'' or ''queixada''.  By following the motion of the kick, the capoeirista steps to the outside of the kicker and uses one hand to push them forward while the closest leg reaps the supporting leg of the kicker.  It looks identical to the [[osoto guruma]] in [[judo]].

*'''Banda de Dentro'''
The banda de dentro or ''passa pe'' is a similar sweep as the rasteira em pe.  While the banda de costa focuses on sweeping the kicking leg from the inside instead.  While one capoeirista is delivering a kick such as a ''martelo'', the other player steps inside and sweeps the supporting leg in an inside to outside motion.

*'''Banda Tracada'''
A basic move in which the user sweeps the opponent's leg with his foot, especially in midst of performing a bigger movement. It is similar to the [[harai tsurikomi ashi]] from [[judo]].

===Boca de Calça===
A takedown executed by grabbing the opponent's pant legs or ankles and pulling.

*'''Boca de Calça de Costas
A version of the Boca de Calça that involves turning your back, reaching between your legs, and pulling the other player down by his ankles or cuffs.  It is usually done crouching under a kick and pulling the supporting [[ankle]] of the leg not extended through the capoeirista's leg. This is not as easy as it sounds because of the timing involved. Many who see this coming would go for a [[rear naked choke]] by hopping onto the capoeirista's back.  A dangerous counter to this is a jump backwards ensuring the person applying the choke receives the blunt force of the ground.
[[File:Corta Capim.gif|thumb|Corta Capim]]

=== Corta Capim ===
literally "Grass Cutter" this sweep is done largely as a counter. The capoeirista drops beneath the kick and brings the knife edge of his/or her foot across into the attacker's ankle or instep. this technique is rarely performed with any real force. It is more used to show what could have been done. The movement is identical to the Coffee Grinder movement in breakdancing.

=== Cruz ===
This is another example of a takedown in capoeira that uses the attack against the attacker.
When a straight kick such as a chapa or bencão is thrown towards the capoeirista, he simply ducks under the attack.  After ducking under the kick, he catches and traps the kicking leg with his back( [[Trapezius muscle]] and [[shoulders]]) and outstretched arms forming a [[cross]].  By standing up (or in some cases jumping)  with the kicking leg trapped along the blades of his shoulder, he provides the [[lever]]age necessary to knock his attacker to the ground.

=== Negativa Derrubando ===
While in a negativa, the front foot slips behind the heel of the other opponent.  After catching the pull of the leg along with the instep hooking the heel should cause the player to fall backwards.

===Paulista===
Much like the rasteira, the paulista is a sweep that uses the instep.  However, instead of sweeping with the outside leg, the inside leg is used.

===Rasteira===
[[File:Rasteira no chao.jpg|thumb|Rasteira]]
A Rasteira is a movement in capoeira used to sweep or pull an opponent's leg in response to a [[kick]].  There are generally four different types: rasteira do chão, rasteira em pé, rasteira de costa, and rasteira com mao.   Many mestres agree that the rasteira is a true embodiment of what capoeira really is.

Instead of meeting the kick with a [[Blocking (martial arts)|block]], the rasteira follows the same direction of the attack turning the opponent's force and confidence against himself.  The theory being that the more committed to the attack a player is, the harder they will fall from a rasteira, e.g. When one player kicks with an armada, a well placed rasteira to the supporting leg will make him/her lose their [[Balance (ability)|balance]] and fall.  One crucial point to remember is that timing is everything when employing a rasteira.  A player just beginning his/her attack is easier to trip verses one whom is firmly planted.

*'''Rasteira do Chão'''
This is the most common form of a rasteira characterized by its long extension of the hooking leg, use of one or two hands for balance, and lower [[center of gravity]].  The capoeirista moves under the incoming kick, hooks the opponent's standing heel or ankle with his [[instep]] and pulls it in a straight motion. The rasteira do chão  allows the capoeirista to use the muscles in the torso as well as his body weight for more leverage, making it a much stronger takedown. It takes a little longer to execute than a rasteira em pé making them more suitable for medium to high spinning kicks and/or when playing games of ''benguela'' or ''angola''.

*'''Rasteira em Pé'''
[[File:Rasteira em pe.jpg|thumb|Rasteira em pe against a martelo]]
Much like the rasteira above, this movement is virtually the same with a few differences.  While the rasteira do chão is used more for circular attacks, the rasteira em pé is more suitable  for quicker or direct attacks such as the martelo or in faster games.  The capoeirista does not crouch as low when hooking his foot around the supporting leg of the other kicker with the power coming more from the step vs the torso.  This version of the rasteira allows for a much faster execution.

*'''Rasteira de Mao'''
This version makes use of the hand. Sometimes in a close game when using the leg requires too much time and energy, this is used instead.  While going along with the motion of the kick, the capoeirista ducks under the kick, grabs the supporting leg, and pulls it leg with his/her [[hand]] towards him/her in the same direction as a rasteira using the [[instep]].

*'''Rasteira de Costa'''
[[File:Rasteira de Costa.gif|thumb|Rasteira de Costa]]
A rasteira de costa is a departure from the pulling motion seen in previous versions rasteiras.  It is more of a spinning back sweep kick that moves in a half circle with the sweeping leg aimed more for the ankle of the supporting leg.  Instead of pulling, the impact from the heel is what causes the other player to fall.  This takedown can be seen in other [[martial art]]  disciplines such as [[Kung Fu]], [[Hapkido]], [[Pencak Silat]], and [[Kajukenbo]].  The rasteira de costa can be used against a spinning attack or an opponent that has a more [[Footwork (martial arts)#Linear footwork|linear fighting stance]].

===Tesoura===
Tesoura lit. ''scissors'', aka. ''Tesoura de Costa'', is a scissor takedown wrapping one leg over the front of the opponent's body near the stomach with the other behind both knees, and then twisting one's own body in the direction the players wants the opponent to fall; usually on their back. It is virtually identical to a [[Kani Basami|kani basami]].

*'''Tesoura de Frente
A variation of the Tesoura (scissors) that targets the legs instead of the torso. The tesoura de Frente moves in low, hooking the outside leg with the calf of one leg while simultaneously  using the knee of the other leg to trap to the opponent's inner thigh with the knee.  With a small amount of effort, the capoeirista rotates his torso away from his opponent using the trapped knee as a [[lever]], knocking the opponent off balance.  This move requires a high level [[finesse]] and timing.

*'''Tesoura Angola
Commonly performed from negativa or queda-de-rins, the capoeirista goes to a prone position, legs facing the opponent and scissored out, hips twisted to protect the groin, supporting themselves on their hands and toes. They then advance upon the opponent by pushing themselves along with their hands, watching by craning their neck over one shoulder, threatening a tesoura de frente. The opponent is expected to escape, traditionally via an aù or by diving over the attacking capoeirist, possibly going into their own Tesoura Angola upon landing. A more daring escape can be performed by traveling under the attacking capoeirista, optionally striking them with an escorpiã you pass under them.

===Tombo-de-Ladeira===
Meaning the Tumbling Slope, AKA, João Pequeno (named for Mestre João Pequeno who is known for making the move popular).
In Capoeira Angola it is a kick from out of an au when one of the legs comes down as an axe kick. The Tombo de Ladeira can also be performed from Rolê position (Queda de Três). It is most effective when the opponent's head is low to the ground.

According to Nestor Capoeira, Tombo-de-Ladeira is a takedown in which one takes advantage of an opponent using an aerial or close to aerial attack or movement by standing up from beneath them. Needless to say, it is dangerous for both parties involved.

===Vingativa===
A low takedown that involves stepping forward and trapping the back legs of an opponent that is in a side [[stance (martial arts)|stance]].  The capoeirista also protects his face with his elbow.  Once the lead leg of the capoeirista has trapped the leg of the opponent, he shifts the weight in his hips forward and up. If the contact is maintained with the legs the other player then he should be thrown up and away. Although this move originally came from [[batuque (game)|batuque]], it has similar appearances as some throws/sweeps in [[Baguazhang]], as well as the [[karate throws#Tai otoshi|tai otoshi]] done in some styles of [[karate]]. Other schools teach a variation which resembles more the [[sukui nage]] or [[obi otoshi]] found in [[judo]].

==Floreios==

Floreios can refer to two things:
a) The complex movements in the ginga of capoeira Angola used as feints, stylistic variations, etc.
b) Acrobatic movements in contemporary regional, sometimes in capoeira Angola, that aren't generally considered offensive or defensive in a game.
These include:

===Bandeira===
Bandeira is an advanced capoeira combination in which the player performs a fast cartwheel which is immediately followed by a side flip. This move can be often seen in capoeira regional roda.

===Folha Seca===
A ''Folha Seca'' lit.''dry leaf'' is very similar to a Flash Kick.  The direction k with the capoeirista kicking with more of a slant in his body during the rotation.  After turning at least 90 degrees to the left or right, the capoerista raises his kicking leg up while jumping off of his support leg.  He brings his arms up while hollowing out his back.  He continues the kick until he lands on his kicking leg.

*'''Folha Seca helicóptero'''
A hyped variation of the folha seca in which a quick change of legs is done in mid air and is landed on the non-kicking leg. In this move, right after the take off, the kicking leg swings over and around the non-kicking leg creating a helicopter like motion.

*'''Chute na lua'''
A ''Chute na lua'' lit.''kick to the moon'' is a combination of a [[Flash Kick]] and gainer. While it can commonly be linked to an S-dobrado, it can also be performed out of nowhere.  After pivoting on the non-kicking leg, the kicking leg is swung straight through and up.  Both arms are raised and the back is hallowed out.  The kicking legs is kept straight while the non-kicking leg is bent.  The kicking leg continues all the way around until the capoeirista lands on it.

===Relógio===

The relogio has similar mechanics as the hand glide in [[Breaking (dancing)|B-boying]].  The main exception to the rule is that the body is resting on the kidneys in a more lateral manner with the body facing to the side.  The entry into a relogio usually begins in the same way as a rolé.  The body turns as both hands touch the ground.  One hand is lifted as the body is rested on the elbow of the arm in contact with the ground.  The spin point is the small portion of the [[carpus]] (same as the 1990 or piao de mao), so that there is a minimal amount of friction between the hand and the ground.  While the relogio is a floeiro it can also be a sweep depending on the timing.

===Pião de Mão===
A hand spin that is done in a very similar way as the 1990 in breakdancing.  The capoeirista begins by turning his body in the same manner as a meia lua de compasso.  By generating enough torque, he raises his leg which is the opposite the hand he places down.  Keeping the weight of the entire body focused on the outer lower portion of his [[Palm tree|palm]], the capoeirista can keep the circular [[momentum]] spin going by lowering the amount of friction between his hand and the surface simultaneously alternating hands during the spins.  The variations and ending positions for this move are virtually limitless.

===Pião de Cabeça===
It is a [[headspin]] in capoeira.  There are numerous ways of executing this technique.  One of them being, after going down into a queda de rins, the capoeirista brings his legs and hip over until all of his weight is on his head and shoulders.  By twisting his [[hips]] and legs around in a counter clockwise/[[clockwise]] fashion, the body's core develops torque.  After releasing his/her hands from the ground, the capoeirista will spin for 180 up to 720 degrees around (depending on his/skill level and balance).   One rule of thumb is that the capoeirista begins this move facing the other player.  This particular move has been a subject of debate in the ongoing argument of [[capoeira]] influencing being the direct predecessor of [[breakdancing]].

===Carpado===
Also known as a Mortal. It is essentially some kind of flip. This is one of the many movements that separates Capoeira Regional from its grounded sister, Capoeira Angola. Capoeira is known for its acrobatics and the mortal is one of its many indicators.  Always depending on the toque of the game and sometimes group, a mortal can be done at almost any time during the game.  Since many capoeiristas see the game of capoeira as an interacting physical dialogue between two bodies, the mortal’s place in capoeira is well received depending on its timing.  Most mortals are done during the entrance into a roda with a fast-paced game.  With so many dynamic movements in capoeira, a mortal is done from almost any spinning kick or au.  With all things in capoeira, there is some debate over the "overuse" of mortals and other flips as some see them as only shallow movements that take away from the effectiveness of the martial art.

*'''Salto'''
This is a generic term for a back somersault.  Usually, but not limited to, entering into rodas and  solos during performances.  After executing a round off and [[back handspring]] (''xango''), the player jumps up while raising both his arms and knees.  He/she continues over until landing on both feet.  The variation that capoeira is known for is the landing on one foot.

*'''Mortal de Frente'''

===Mariposa===
The mariposa is not a butterfly kick, but rather a Butterfly twist.  While there are many entrances into the spin (for example, a capoeirista could enter into the movement with a folha secca and then continue with the movement, which is more commonly called a corkscrew), it is commonly seen as a complete 360 spin of the body while it is horizontal in the air.  Debate has surfaced on when this first appeared.  In the final fight scene in [[Only the Strong (film)|Only the Strong]], kung-fu artist [[Marc Dacascos]] executes this as his finishing move against the other fighter.  Since then, the mariposa has been spotted in rodas all over the world.

===Helicóptero===
[[File:Helicoptero kick.gif|thumb|Helicoptero kick]]
A helicoptero is an Aú with a circular movement of the legs, like a helicopter.  The technique starts off as a regular au, but when the body is inverted (both legs are off the ground), a twist of the legs is done so that the leg that left the ground second lands on the ground first.

This technique can be combined with the "master swipe" from tricking to add more spin and make the move more aesthetic.  The master swipe is a cartwheel where the inside leg leaves the ground first in contrast to the outside leg from a regular cartwheel

===Armada Dupla===
Armada Dupla is one of the signature moves of capoeira. It is performed as an un-tucked side flip with legs forming a 90-degree angle. Unlike the side flip, this move doesn't use the tucking motion to get the rotation. Instead, it is done by jumping upwards and torquing your body. At one point, your legs will simply follow through with the momentum of your body and drive you around.

The [[Olympic Games]], part of the [[Olympic movement]], was the first major, modern, [[multi-sport event]] of international significance.]]

A '''[[multi-sport event]]''' is an organized sporting event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports between organized teams of athletes from (mostly) nation-states. Events are typically held over a few days to accommodate the large number of events held, often more than those in single-sport competitions. The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance was the modern [[Olympic Games]]. Some of the most recognised sporting events in the world today are multi-sport events — the [[Asian Games]], the [[Commonwealth Games]], the [[Pan American Games]] and the [[Mediterranean Games]] — among others. This article lists all major multi-sport events, whether defunct or functioning, in the modern day. A full listing of all major multi-sport events is provided in the table below.

Transnational multi-sport events are often organised across concords of cultural elements between nations. These include language, such as the [[Francophone Games]] for [[French language|French]]-speaking nations; ethnic, such as the [[Maccabiah Games]] for [[Jewish]] athletes; political, such as the [[Spartakiad]] used to oppose the Olympics; occupation, such as the [[Universiade]] for [[university]] students; and gender, such as [[World Outgames]] for the [[gay]] community. Participation is also delineated across other lines including region, religion, age, and [[season]] (winter instead of summer). A number of multi-sport events are held within nations, where athletes representing various intra-national states or districts compete against each other; these include the [[Thailand National Games]] and the [[National Games of China]]. These differences in intended audiences are highlighted in the table.

== Historical ==
{{further|History of sport}}

Prior to the modern day, there were instances of multi-sport events held centuries or millennia in the past. The [[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Tailteann Games]], held near modern [[Telltown]] in [[Ireland]], was one of the first multi-sport festivals to be recorded, with a history that traces back to 1829 BC. There were several other games held in Europe in the [[Classical antiquity|classical era]]. the [[Panhellenic Games]] encompassed the Ancient Olympic Games, which was the precursor to the modern Olympic Games; the [[Pythian Games]]; the [[Nemean Games]]; and the [[Isthmian Games]]. The [[Roman Games]], held in [[ancient Rome]], focused on Greek sports as well as the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] sport of [[gladiator]]ial combat. Other multi-sport festivals emerged in the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, including the [[Cotswold Olimpick Games]] in England, the [[Highland games]] in Scotland still in existence today, and the Olympiade de la République in France in the 19th century.

As these multi-sport events or festivals occurred pre-20th century, when the rules for today's [[History of sport|modern sports]] were largely different or yet to be established, these are not included in the table. The events noted in this section documents all known historical multi-sport events.

== Scope ==
Multi-sport events can be classified by scope. Some cater to international audiences; some to regional audiences; and some are held within nations. These differences are presented in the table as well, in addition to other divisions such as ethnicity and historical origins as described earlier.

Only a few modern multi-sport events cater to international audiences without cultural or political boundaries. The most famous of these is the [[Olympic Games]]. The others are namely the [[World Games]], established to host sports not within [[Olympic sports|the Olympic scope]]; the [[World Mind Sports Games]], which hosts competitions in [[mind sport]]s which are not found in either of the two abovementioned events; the [[X Games]] and the [[Winter X Games]], organised for [[extreme sports|extreme action sports]]; the [[World Combat Games]], for martial arts and combat sports; and the now-cancelled [[Goodwill Games]].

Similarly, there are also regional multi-sport events held that purely cater to regional audiences regardless of cultural and/or political elements. These are often grouped by continent and sub-continental regions. The Asian Games are held for athletes in Asia; the [[Central Asian Games]], the [[East Asian Games]], the [[South Asian Games]] and the [[Southeast Asian Games]] cater to [[Central Asia]], [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] respectively, which are all regions of the Asian continent. In the Americas, the largest multi-sport event that fits the description is the [[Pan American Games]]. The other multi-sport events in the continent are the [[South American Games]], the [[Central American Games]], the [[Central American and Caribbean Games]] and the [[Central American Games]].

== List of major multi-sport events ==
The criteria in listing a multi-sport event is as follows: The event should have received significant media coverage where it is covered; national, regional, or international. At the same time, organisation of the event is taken charge by a formal body, with at least one sport in the event sanctioned by an international [[sports federation]] that is recognised by the [[International Olympic Committee]] or the [[General Association of International Sports Federations]] (GAISF).

The '''Olympic Velodrome''' for the [[Cycling at the 1984 Summer Olympics|track cycling]] events at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] was located on the campus of [[California State University, Dominguez Hills]] in [[Carson, California]]. Constructed between 1981 and 1982, the [[velodrome]] was sponsored by the [[United States|American]] [[convenience store]] chain [[7-Eleven]].

The 333.3 meter long track was demolished in 2003 and replaced by the [[ADT Event Center]] in 2004, now known as the [[VELO Sports Center]], which remains the only Olympic-standard velodrome in the United States.   The ADT center was built to the south of where the Olympic Velodrome had been.  [[StubHub Center]] soccer stadium (formerly Home Depot Center) is situated where the velodrome once stood.

==History==
On 4 February 1981 California State University Dominguez Hills was selected as the site of the Olympic velodrome.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; CSU Dominguez Hills President Don Gerth was eager to include the university in the ’84 Olympics. When Olympic Organizing Committee Chair [[Peter Ueberroth]] asked Gerth if he would like to have the Olympic velodrome, he replied, “We’ll take it. What’s a velodrome?&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csudh.edu/univadv/dateline/archives/20090813/campusnews/alookback.htm&lt;/ref&gt;”

On 9 July 1981 construction began on the Olympic velodrome, and it was completed on time and under budget prior to the 8 July 1982 dedication and 7-Eleven/Bicycling Magazine Grand Prix on July 9-10th, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 7-Eleven velodrome was one of only three permanent facilities built specifically for the 1984 Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The track was {{convert|333.333|m|ft}} in length, {{convert|6|m|ft}} wide, banked at 33 degrees in the turns, 9 degrees on the straights, and was made of concrete. Prior to the Games, the track experienced small hairline cracks. These were fixed by an epoxy injection system and series of grinding to reduce bumps common to concrete tracks, and the track was coated with polyurethane prior to the Olympics for the fastest possible surface. Riders said the track was “smooth but sticky."&lt;ref&gt;http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent stands were built to accommodate 2,000 spectators, but with temporary seating additions capacity for the Games was between 6,400 and 8,000. The Los Angeles developer and contractor Stolte Inc. built the velodrome for $3 million. Prior to the Games, the Olympic velodrome was one of the most requested venues for tours.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1984 Games was perhaps the most successful in [[USA Cycling]] history. It was also the first Olympics to have Women’s Cycling. The LAOOC petitioned for Women’s Individual Sprint and Pursuit events, but the requests were denied by the [[IOC]]. [[Connie Carpenter-Phinney]] and [[Rebecca Twigg]] took the Gold and Silver Medals in the 45 women field in the Individual road race, the first in Olympic history. On the track, [[Mark Gorski]] won the Individual Sprint Gold over ‘The Cheetah’ [[Nelson Vails]] in the all USA Final, and [[Steve Hegg]] won the 4000m Individual Pursuit. Altogether the US won a record 9 medals in cycling events. After the Games it was revealed 1/3 of the US team received blood transfusions before the event, which was still 1 year before it was banned by the IOC.

'''Rapha Performance Roadwear''' is a [[Sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] and lifestyle brand focused on [[road bicycle racing]], clothing and accessories. Rapha headquarters are in [[London]] with a United States office in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Company|url=http://pages.rapha.cc/service/about-rapha/the-company|publisher=Rapha|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company was started in [[London]] in early 2004 by [[Simon Mottram]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Penn|first=Rob|title=Pedalling fashion: the rise of cycle style|url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/hot-50-supplement/hot-50-rapha/|publisher=Design Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Luke Scheybeler]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Lucie|title=New sportswear line|url=https://www.ft.com/content/a6984224-546b-11e4-b2ea-00144feab7de|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first products were launched in July of that year. The name Rapha was taken from the 1960s cycling team [[Rapha (cycling team)|Rapha]], which was named after the [[Apéritif and digestif|apéritif]] drink company Saint Raphaël.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Original Rapha|url=http://inrng.com/2012/05/original-rapha-history/|work=The Inner Ring|accessdate=21 May 2013|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Rapha partnered with British designer [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]] to create a range of limited-edition cycle clothing and accessories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapha + Paul Smith collection unveiled|url=http://roadcyclinguk.com/news/gear-news/rapha-paul-smith-collection-unveiled.html|work=Road Cycling UK|accessdate=1 October 2012|date=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Rapha collaborated with bikepacking design pioneer Apidura on a limited range of cycling luggage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cyclingindustry.news/rapha-partners-apidura-for-bar-and-saddlebag-line/|title=Rapha partners Apidura for bar and saddlebag line|date=2016-06-15|work=Cycling Industry News|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Rapha clothing is produced in a number of different locations including the UK, Italy and the Far East. UK production included some early Merino wool pieces and also leather gloves which are made in Somerset, England. Italian production focuses on stretch fabric and stretch garments such as shorts and tights. In China production focuses on the most technical items, such as outerwear.

In recent years, Rapha has developed an international cycling club, in which members have access to exclusive club apparel and high-end bike rentals (currently supplied by [[Canyon Bicycles]]).  The Rapha Cycling Club (RCC) hosts rides and events at stores known as Clubhouses in 21 international locations throughout the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia.  Each clubhouse consists of a retail space that sells Rapha apparel and accessories, as well as a cafe that serves coffee and food while screening live cycle racing.  Clubhouses also play host to a number of cycling-related events and art exhibitions throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;http://pages.rapha.cc/clubs&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, it was announced that Rapha would be purchased by RZC Investments, a company setup by [[Steuart Walton]], for £200m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walmart heirs' fund wins £200m race for cycling brand Rapha|url=http://news.sky.com/story/walmart-heirs-fund-wins-200m-race-for-cycling-brand-rapha-10978288|accessdate=7 August 2017|date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsorships==
Rapha used to co-own the UK-based cycling team {{ct|RCS|2014}} with London bike brand [[Condor Cycles]] and the [[cyclocross]] team Rapha Focus; at the end of 2014 Rapha announced they would end their grassroots sponsorship to focus on Team Sky and {{ct|WGN}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rapha-focus.cx/sponsors/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427233133/http://rapha-focus.cx/sponsors/ |archivedate=2014-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2012, it was announced that as of 2013, Rapha would be producing the clothing for the British cycling team, {{ct|SKY|2013}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Merrill|first=Jamie|title=Sky's the limit for cult clothing brand Rapha|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/skys-the-limit-for-cult-clothing-brand-rapha-8101496.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=1 October 2012|date=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Australian Cyclocross champion for 2013 and 2014, Lisa Jacobs, chooses to wear Rapha clothing.
On November 3, 2015, Rapha announced that their {{ct|SKY|2016}} sponsorship would end after the 2016 season.  In an effort to grow and promote women's cycling, Rapha began supplying clothing to the [[UCI Women's WorldTour]] team [[Canyon-SRAM]].&lt;ref&gt;http://pages.rapha.cc/feature/canyon-sram-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46762">The '''Red Bull X-Alps''' is a [[paragliding]] race in which athletes must hike or fly 1,000&amp;nbsp;km across the Alps. It first launched in 2003 and has since taken place every other year. Around 30 athletes take part and must navigate their way via a predetermined set of turnpoints that vary with each race. Every kilometer must be covered either on [[foot]] or by paraglider. Teams consist of one athlete and one official supporter, whose role it is to provide technical advice, mental and nutritional support.

The route traditionally covers the Alpine regions of [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]] and [[France]] before ending in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, [[France]]. Athletes don't fly into Monaco due to airspace restrictions, and the term "Monaco" is used solely for marketing purposes. The exact route is normally unveiled in the spring before the race start. For the first time in the race's history, the 2017 route will feature [[Slovenia]].

New to the 2015 race was the Powertraveller Prologue, a one-day hike and paragliding contest in the Salzburgerland region. Starting and finishing in Fuschl am See, athletes had to hike or fly a 38&amp;nbsp;km course around two turnpoints, the Zwölferhorn and Schafberg peaks. It was won by Paul Guschlbauer in 2h 21m. In 2017, the prologue will return to Fuschl am See as the Leatherman Prologue on June 29.

The 2015 race started July 5 and ended July 17. It was won for the fourth time in a row by the Swiss athlete Christian Maurer who reached the finish, a landing float in Monaco bay, on July 14. His official time, which stops at the final turnpoint of Peille above Monaco, was 8d 4h 37m.

==History==
The concept for the Red Bull X-Alps was developed by Austrian pilot [[Hannes Arch]] who saw a TV documentary in which German pilot Toni Bender crossed the Alps from North to South by paraglider, carrying all his equipment, sleeping rough and hiking parts of the way.

"I thought it would be cool to base a paragliding competition on this format and developed a basic concept for it - and the idea was born! Together with [[Red Bull]], we have developed it over the years to be the Red Bull X-Alps it is today - the toughest and most extreme endurance and outdoor race in the world. Its simplicity is what makes it most appealing. We start in Salzburg and whoever arrives in Monaco first wins. That's it. It's about body and soul, not about hundreds of rules and regulations," Arch has said.&lt;ref&gt;Red Bull X-Alps&lt;/ref&gt;

When conditions are good, athletes use [[paraglider]]s to fly, and when they are not they must run or hike, carrying their paraglider and other mandatory equipment. The use of [[tunnel]]s and all other form of transport is not permitted.

The first edition led from Austria's [[Dachstein]] [[Glacier]] to Monaco via Germany's highest mountain, the [[Zugspitze]], [[Mont Blanc]] and Mont Gros in France. Seventeen athletes and their support teams covered a distance of 800 kilometers as the crow flies. Over the years the route and the turnpoints have changed. From 2009 the race started off in the Austrian city of [[Salzburg]]. At 1,031 kilometers, the 2013 course was the longest in the history of the race and athletes had to pass 10 turnpoints: [[Gaisberg]], Dachstein, and [[Wildkogel]] in Austria; Zugspitze in Germany; [[Ortler]]/[[Sulden]] in Italy; [[Interlaken]], [[Matterhorn]] in Switzerland; Mont Blanc, Saint Hilaire, and [[Peille]] in France. So far the race has only ever been won by Swiss nationals.

Thanks to [[GPS]]-Live Tracking, all athletes can be followed in real time on the official website throughout the race. The exact position of the athletes is monitored via data loggers and GSM cell phones. The athletes also carry a camera with them at all times. Stills and videos are used in the athletes’ online diaries, which are kept up to date by their supporters.

==Rules==
The first athlete to reach Monaco wins the race, which ends 48 hours later but not before a set finish time as defined by organizers. Thereafter, the race will officially end and athletes will be requested to stop racing. Pilots who have not reached the final destination within this time will be ranked according to the distance left to the final destination. Since the 2011 edition, athletes are forced to have a mandatory rest between 23:00 and 04:00 and stay within a radius of 250m of their resting position for safety reasons. In 2013, the mandatory break was extended by 1.5 hours, from 22:30 to 05:00. If an athlete was still moving in that time, he would be subjected to a minimum penalty of 24 hours.  Athletes with penalty times had to prolong their next rest for the duration of their penalty time. Failure to comply with this rule led to disqualification.

New in 2013 was the so-called Night Pass, which allowed athletes to hike through the night. To use they had to inform organizers of their intention by 12:00 local time the day they wished to use. The idea behind the Night Pass was to allow athletes a chance to advance their position by tactical means once during the race. They may be able to hike to a key point where they can extend their lead or pass teams in front. Since 2013, prototypes are banned from the competition and all equipment, including paragliders, harnesses and helmets must comply with EN or LTF certifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbullxalps.com/rules.html|title=Rules - Red Bull X-Alps|first= Red Bull|last=X-Alps|work=redbullxalps.com|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 1,031&amp;nbsp;km, the route was almost 200&amp;nbsp;km longer than in 2011. Chrigel Maurer was the first to arrive in Monaco, winning for the third time in a row. He made it in a record time of 6 days, 23h and 40min. He traveled a total distance of 2,556&amp;nbsp;km, 2,288&amp;nbsp;km of which he covered by paraglider and 268&amp;nbsp;km on the ground.

==X-Alps 2015==

===Route===

The route was announced on March 19, 2015.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbullxalps.com/race/route-2015.html |title= Red Bull X-Alps Route|first= Red Bull|last=X-Alps|work=redbullxalps.com|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows an arc of Europe's highest mountains, starting in Salzburg, Austria and finishing in Monaco. The 2015 route has ten turnpoints and a straight-line distance of 1,038&amp;nbsp;km and is more challenging tactically than the 2013 race due to it having less obvious flight paths.

New to the 2015 edition was the Powertraveller Prologue, a one-day hike and paragliding race around the mountains of Fuschl am See. The first three athletes to finish the Prologue were each rewarded with a five-minute headstart in the Red Bull X-Alps race start on July 5 and an additional Led Lenser Nightpass to journey through the night, which is normally a mandatory rest period. First was Paul Guschlbauer (AUT1) 2h21m, second was Stanislav Mayer (CZE) in 2h22m, third was Gavin McClurg (USA2) 2h24m.

==X-Alps 2017==

===Route===
The route was announced on March 29, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.redbullxalps.com/news/article/the-route-for-the-2017-red-bull-x-alps-has-been-announced.html | title=The Route for the 2017 Red Bull X-Alps has been announced! | first=Red Bull | last=X-Alps | work=redbullxalps.com | date=29 March 2017 | accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With seven turnpoints and a straight-line distance of 1,138&amp;nbsp;km, it was the longest route so far.

In 2017, the Prologue returned as the Leatherman Prologue race on June 29. The one-day hiking race which saw no paragliding due to bad weather took place around the mountains of Fuschl am See. The athletes started in Fuschl and reached the Zwölferhorn before returning to Fuschl as fast as possible. The first three athletes to finish the Prologue race were rewarded with a head start on day two of the main race and an additional Ledlenser Nightpass to journey through the night, which is normally a mandatory rest period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redbullxalps.com/race/prologue-2017.html&lt;/ref&gt;

They are based in [[Spanish Town]] and their home stadium is the [[Prison Oval]].

==History==
Rivoli relegated to the second level of Jamaican football after finishing bottom in the 2005/2006 season. In June 2008 they finished runner-up in the promotion play-offs to clinch a place among the elite for the 2008/2009 season.  The team was relegated at the end of the 2009/10 season.

At the start of November, Rivoli's match against Reno was postponed because of the sudden death of midfielder Enrico Beech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/sports/html/20081102t010000-0500_142054_obs_dpl_goes_live_on_the_internet_battle_for_end_of_round_final_heats_up.asp DPL goes live on the internet Battle for End-of-Round Final heats up] - Jamaica Observer&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2015/16 season they finished second to bottom of the table being relegated to the South Central Confederation Super League.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5451">[[Image:Camels with robot jockies.jpg|thumb|Camels mounted by robot jockeys]]
A '''robot jockey''' is commonly used on [[camel]]s in [[camel racing]] as a replacement for human [[jockey]]s. Developed since 2004, the [[robot]]ic jockeys are slowly phasing out the use of human jockeys, which in the case of camel racing in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Bahrain]], [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Qatar]], often [[Child camel jockey|employs small children]] who reportedly suffer repeated systemic [[human rights abuse]]s. In response to international condemnation of such abuses, the nations of Qatar and the UAE have banned the use of human jockeys in favor of robots.

==Use of humans==
[[File:Robotic camel jockey at Al Shahaniya Racetrack.jpg|thumb|Robot jockey at [[Al-Shahaniya]] Camel Racetrack]]
Camel racing has been around for thousands of years. "The Sport of [[Sheikh|Sheiks]]" almost exclusively utilized small children, usually boys around the age of four, to ride and direct the camels. Often, the boys would be [[starvation|starved]] to be as light as possible. Many of the boys used for the races were often sold to race organizers or camel owners, and there was an active [[child slavery|child]] [[slave trade]] for camel jockeys, involving victims of kidnapping or the children of destitute families who sold them into servitude.&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/robotics/2005-04-19-qatar-camalbots_x.htm "Qatar to use robots as camel riders"] by Tarek Al-Issawi of the [[Associated Press]] via [[USA Today]], 2005-04-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.11/camel.html?pg=1&amp;topic=camel&amp;topic_set= "Robots of Arabia"] by Jim Lewis, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', Issue 13.11, November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banning of child jockeys==
The [[United Arab Emirates]] was the first to ban the use of children under 15 as jockeys in the popular local sport of camel racing when [[Sheikh]] [[Hamdan bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan|Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan]] announced the ban on July 29, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/theuae/2005/May/theuae_May691.xml&amp;section=theuae UAE enforces stringent steps to eradicate child jockeys] (Wam), ''[[Khaleej Times]]'', 24 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The UAE issues penalties such as jail and banning for those found using children as jockeys.

In [[Qatar]], the [[Emir of Qatar]], [[Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani]], banned child jockeys in 2005&lt;ref name=GUK&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/life/thisweek/story/0,12977,1458529,00.html Can robots ride camels?] by Ian Sample, ''[[The Guardian]]'', Thursday, 2005-04-14&lt;/ref&gt; and directed that, by 2007, all camel races would be directed by robotic jockeys.&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;

==Development and usage==
[[Image:Robot jockey army.jpg|thumb|Robot jockeys]]

The government of Qatar initiated development of the robots at the beginning of 2001. The first successful model was made in 2003 by Stanely in co-ordination with Rashid Ali Ibrahim from the Qatar Scientific Club. At the end of 2003, the design, with a revised analysis, was tendered to [[Switzerland|Swiss]] robotics firm K-Team. Initial problems faced by the design team, led by Alexandre Colot, included the fact that the camels were conditioned to the use of human jockeys.  Early designs confused or frightened the camels.&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt; The designs were modified to include more human-like features, including a [[mannequin]]-like face, [[sunglasses]], hats, [[racing silks]] and even traditional perfumes used by human jockeys.&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt; Other technical issues included the conditions that the robots and the computers would be put under: the high temperatures of a dusty desert environment along with a fast-moving and uneven ride. The first successful official race featuring robotic jockeys was conducted in Qatar by 2005. The robots are [[aluminum]]-framed with a "thorax" about the size of a large book and contain small hinged arms that control the whip and the reins.  The robot can also monitor and transmit the speed and heart rate of the camel.

Due to their heavy weight (16 to 18&amp;nbsp;kg) and high cost, the Swiss product was ruled out and replaced by smaller, lighter (2 to 3&amp;nbsp;kg) and lower-priced models in Qatar and the UAE. The newer models were developed using RKE systems further enhanced with two-way radio controls and GSM mobile controls by HM Maruff and, later, a "Voice &amp; Hit Command Robot with Shock Sensor" following further research at the RAQBI Centre.

The robots are remote controlled by operators being driven alongside the race track in [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s.&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;

==Current usage==
Widespread usage is initiated from [[Qatar]] and [[UAE]] and further extended to all [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC countries]] where the robots have been widely accepted.&lt;ref name=AP2&gt;[http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/2006/dec/07/camel-racing-sport-sheiks/ "Camel racing 'sport of sheiks'"] by Eric Talmadge of the [[Associated Press]] via ''The San Angelo Standard-Times'', 2006-12-07&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme recognises a school's out of hours sports provision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportdevelopment.org.uk/html/sportsmarks.html Sportsmark &amp; Activemark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012084647/http://www.sportdevelopment.org.uk/html/sportsmarks.html |date=2006-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sportsmark awards are given to secondary schools for provision for sport and physical education. They are currently being reviewed along with [[Activemark]] awards with plans for a new sports partnership mark. When the policies were introduced there was little other investment into school sport. In England, if a school or college is given sportsmark accreditation, it is then entered for specialist status.

The field opened in 1967 as '''Wildcat Park''', with the first game being held on March 19, 1967.  On March 19, 2005, the venue was renamed after T. Henry Wilson Jr., class of 1951.  Wilson played both [[college baseball|baseball]] and [[college football|football]] at Davidson, and a donation by his family made significant renovations to the field possible.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;

In 2003, lights were installed at the facility, allowing the first night games to be played at then-Wildcat Park.  In 2005, after a donation from the Wilson family, new [[bleachers]], [[infield]], [[concession stand]]s, and a [[press box]] were added.  In 2009, an indoor practice facility outside the field was completed.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5728">The '''Tennessee State Fairground Sports Arena''' is an arena in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], on the grounds of the [[Tennessee State Fair]]. It is also known by the nickname the '''TNA Asylum''' due to the venue hosting Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, now [[Impact Wrestling]]) events for two years in the early 2000s.

==History==
The building was constructed in 1922, by workers from [[South Dakota]]. The building was originally a flea market. It was operated throughout the 1960s and 1970s by promoter [[Nick Gulas]] as a [[professional wrestling]] venue.

After taping their initial shows in the [[Von Braun Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], then moving their next few to the [[Nashville Municipal Auditorium]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], TNA moved their weekly pay-per-view events to the Tennessee State Fairgrounds Sports Arena in July 2002. The name "TNA Asylum" was first used during the ninth weekly pay-per-view by [[Ron Killings]]. The Asylum also served as the home of ''[[TNA Xplosion]]'', TNA's weekly syndicated television show, from its inception until October 2004.

After debuting ''[[TNA Impact!]]'', which was taped at [[Impact Wrestling Zone|Soundstage 21]] at [[Universal Studios Florida]], TNA decided that they would eventually shut down their weekly pay-per-view operations in favor of switching to a monthly pay-per-view format. Shortly after, they held their final weekly pay-per-view event (on September 8, 2004) before permanently departing from the Asylum in favor of running their shows exclusively out of Universal Soundstage 21.

[[Showtime All-Star Wrestling]] used the arena a couple times during the year of 2009, filming some of their television episodes at the Sports Arena.

On October 6, 2009 it was announced that the Nashville Mayor [[Karl Dean]] would be closing down the Tennessee State Fairgrounds at the end of June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/mayors-statement-puts-end-state-fair|title=Mayor's statement puts an end to State Fair|publisher=[[The City Paper]]|date=2009-10-06|accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 12, 2010, TNA Wrestling returned to the Asylum for a one last [[House show|live event]], headlined by [[Jeff Hardy]] defending the [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]] against [[Elijah Burke|D'Angelo Dinero]], before the proposed demolition of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/18323/|title=TNA house show report 11-12 Nashville|last=Goodman|first=Larry|date=2010-11-13|accessdate=2010-11-13|work=[[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on January 18, 2011, the Nashville City Council voted to keep the arena open through 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/171378/Former-TNA-Asylum-to-Be-Kept-Open.htm|title=Former TNA Asylum to Be Kept Open|last=Thomas|first=Jeremy|date=2011-01-23|accessdate=2011-01-24|work=411Mania}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote on a [[referendum]] issue on the ballot for the August 2011 [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Metro Nashville-Davidson County]] election made it much harder legally for the municipality either to dispose of or severely alter the operation of the Fairgrounds, and most of the facilities there remain in at least limited operation as of 2015.

On January 29, 2011, there was a "Tribute to the Fairgrounds" pro wrestling event, highlighting many of the Memphis-area wrestling legends who helped make the arena famous, with the main event being [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry "The King" Lawler]] vs [[Bill Dundee|"Superstar" Bill Dundee]] in front of a sold-out crowd of 1,700.

Beginning in 2012, Crossfire Entertainment used the Sports Arena for their live events. They  hosted "Tribute to the Fairgrounds" events before the proposed demolition, but later used it as a primary location for their shows. On August 4, 2012, Crossfire Wrestling announced TV production would return to the Nashville Fairgrounds Sports Arena, thanks to [[Paramount Pictures]], as they were to be hosting HD/3D TV Tapings there. To add on to this, Crossfire was to be the first professional wrestling organization to be shot in [[3D television|3D]]. On February 17, 2013, Crossfire Wrestling announced that they had to cease operations, leaving the venue empty for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=75491]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2013, TCW Wrestling's "Tennessee Takeover" was held at the Sports Arena, which was the first event held in the arena since January 2013. On June 22, 2014, the first-ever live televised pay-per-view for [[Ring of Honor]], [[Best in the World 2014]], was held at the venue.

On October 21, 2018, the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] held its 70th Anniversary show in the building, garnering the biggest gate revenue for a professional wrestling show in the venue's history.

[[Impact Wrestling]] is set to return to The Asylum on January 6, 2019 with a PPV event called [[Impact Wrestling Homecoming|Homecoming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/impact-wrestling-announces-homecoming-ppv-january-6th-nashville-tennessee|title=IMPACT Wrestling Announces 'Homecoming' PPV For January 6th In Nashville, Tennessee - Fightful Wrestling|work=www.fightful.com|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
At a baseball game, an irritating heckler ([[Charley Chase]]) annoys the crowd and the players with his obnoxious taunts.

==Reception==
''The Heckler'' has received positive reviews. [[Hal Erickson (author)|Hal Erickson]] wrote that, "The Heckler is without question one of the most consistently funny shorts ever assembled at Columbia, not to mention one of Charley Chase's most hilarious performances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erickson|first=Hal|title=The baseball filmography, 1915 through 2001|year=2002|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786412720|page=494|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HuBkAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The Great Baseball Films,'' Rob Edelman described ''The Heckler'' as "one of the best-ever baseball-related talkie shorts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edelman|first=Rob|title=The Great Baseball Films|year=1994|publisher=Carol Pub. Group|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MPwHAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] wrote that ''The Heckler'' was one of Charley Chase's "best starring comedies"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maltin|first=Leonard|title=Leonard Maltin's movie encyclopedia|year=1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BKEYAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included it in his book "The Great Movie Shorts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maltin|first=Leonard|title=The Great Movie Shorts|year=1972|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w22GAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tony’s Pizza Events Center''', formerly the '''Bicentennial Center''', is located in [[Salina, Kansas]]. It includes a 7,583-seat multipurpose [[arena]], meeting rooms and Heritage Hall, an 18,000 square foot [[convention center]]. It is home of the [[Salina Liberty]] of the [[Champions Indoor Football]] league, and is nicknamed ''Mid-America's Meeting Place''. On February 22, 2017, it was announced that the name of the Bicentennial Center would be changed to the Tony's Pizza Events Center, effective immediately.&lt;ref name="tony"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Montague|first1=Sharon|title=BiCenter to be called Tony's Pizza Events Center|url=http://www.salina.com/news/local/bicenter-to-be-called-tony-s-pizza-event-center/article_e0f189a6-de16-5ef3-9ddd-ed3160997abd.html|website=Salina Journal|accessdate=February 25, 2017|language=en|date=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City of Salina is the primary owner of the center. [[Comcast Spectacor#Spectra|Spectra]] manages the center as well as more than 100 other public assembly facilities around the world.

A variety of events are held at the events center, including concerts, family shows, sport events, trade shows, and conventions. Annual events include: Salina Invitational Basketball Tournament, Salina Home &amp; Leisure Show, [[Kansas State High School Activities Association]] (KSHSAA) 4A Wrestling, Basketball and Volleyball State Tournaments, [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA) Women's Division I Basketball National Championship, Mid-America Farm Expo, Shrine Circus, Tri-Rivers Fair, and commencements for [[Salina Area Technical College]], [[Brown Mackie College]], and USD 305.

The arena has been home to five professional sports franchises: the [[Kansas Cagerz]] of the [[USBL|United States Basketball League]] (1999–2007), the [[Salina Rattlers]] of the [[International Basketball Association]] (2000–2001), the [[Salina Bombers]] of the [[Champions Indoor Football]] league (2013–2015), the [[Salina Liberty]], also of the CIF (2016–present), and the [[Salina Saints]] of the [[American Basketball Association (2000-present)|American Basketball Association]] (2016–present).

==History==
The first concert at the center was the Osmonds, on June 2, 1979. The concert sold out, and there was a crowd of 7,300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Nate|last1=Jenkins|title=20 YEARS OF SALINA BICENTENNIAL CENTER: Concerts have made center popular|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/2267884/|accessdate=February 26, 2017|work=Newspapers.com|date=September 19, 1999|location=Salina, Kansas|page=5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 1990, the rock band [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] performed at the arena as part of their [[Hot in the Shade Tour]]. During the show, the band's enormous stage set overloaded the arena's power supply causing a transformer to explode outside the building and cutting electricity inside the arena. This abruptly ended the show before the band could complete their set. A short time later, band member [[Paul Stanley]] phoned a local radio station and promised to return to Salina to make up for the shortened show. This phone call was recorded and played on the air. To date, KISS has never returned.

On February 22, 2017, the center was renamed from Salina Bicentennial Center to Tony's Pizza Event Center, described as "the largest [[pizza]] facility in the world.” A food service subsidiary of [[Schwan Food Company]] paid $1,200,000 to receive comprehensive naming rights for 15 years.&lt;ref name="tony" /&gt;
