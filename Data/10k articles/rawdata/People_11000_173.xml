'''Abigail Hopper Gibbons''', neé '''Abigail Hopper''' (December 7, 1801 &amp;ndash; January 16, 1893) was an American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], schoolteacher, and social welfare activist. She assisted in founding and led several nationally known societies for social reform during and following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

She grew up in [[Philadelphia]] in a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] family; her father, [[Isaac Hopper]], opposed slavery and aided fugitive [[slavery|slave]]s. She grew to share her father's beliefs and spent much of her life working for social reform in several fields. In 1841, the New York Monthly Meeting disowned Gibbons' father and husband for their anti-slavery writing. Abigail Gibbons resigned the following year, also removing her minor children.&lt;ref name="Swarthmore"&gt;"[http://www.swarthmore.edu/Library/friends/ead/5174ahgi.xml Abby Hopper Gibbons Papers, 1824-1992: Background Notes"], 1996, Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College, Retrieved 11 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibbons was prominent during and after the American Civil War, when her work in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]; [[Washington, D.C.]]; and [[New York City]], New York included [[civil rights]] and education for blacks, [[prison reform]] for women, medical care for Union officers during the war, aid to veterans returning from the war, to help them find work; and [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]]. Because she was a known abolitionist, her house was among those attacked and destroyed during the [[New York City draft riots]] of July 1863.&lt;ref name=CBSNews-UndergroundRR-2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silverman|first1=Alex|title=Chelsea Neighbors Declare Victory In Fight To Preserve Manhattan’s Last Underground Railroad Stop|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/05/24/chelsea-underground-railroad-stop/|work=[[CBS News]]|date=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Life and Career==
Abigail Hopper was born in Philadelphia in 1801, the third of ten children. She was informally called Abby.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, Sarah Emerson: ''The Life of Abby Hopper Gibbons as Told Chiefly Through Her Correspondence'' (1896)&lt;/ref&gt; Both of her parents were proud abolitionists. Her father, [[Isaac Tatem Hopper]], was of the [[Elias Hicks|Hicks]]ite branch of Quakers. Her mother, Sarah Tatum Hopper, became a recommended minister for the Society of Friends &lt;ref&gt; http://asp6new.alexanderstreet.com/was2/was2.object.details.aspx?dorpid=1000640987 &lt;/ref&gt; and oversaw schools for black children along with a committee.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DXysBwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=%22abigail+hopper%22&amp;ots=BIpn4EsVgH&amp;sig=ZP5xanylmLqPUAUzASckAUk9CrE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22abigail%20hopper%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father became an active and leading member of The [[Pennsylvania Abolition Society]]. He often directly confronted slave kidnappers, who frequented Philadelphia and sometimes kidnapped [[free people of color|free blacks]] for sale into slavery, as well as captured fugitive slaves to gain bounties. Called upon to protect the rights of African Americans, Isaac Hopper and his wife garnered a reputation as friends and advisers of the "oppressed race" in all emergencies. The Hoppers also sheltered many poor Quakers in their house, despite their own family's large size and the father's unstable financial status. The children early on were called to aid others.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Both of Hopper's parents came from historically Quaker families and passed Quaker beliefs down to their children. Hopper further practiced these beliefs by attending Friends' schools growing up. In 1821, she also founded a school that practiced Quaker beliefs. Later, in 1830, Hopper moved to [[New York City|New York]] and became a teacher at a Quaker school. &lt;ref&gt; https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abigail-Hopper-Gibbons &lt;/ref&gt;

Abigail grew up to share her parents' abolitionist sentiments. She worked with well-known abolitionists of her time, including [[Lydia Maria Child]], [[Sarah Moore Grimké]], [[William Lloyd Garrison]], and [[Theodore Dwight Weld]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://asp6new.alexanderstreet.com/was2/was2.object.details.aspx?dorpid=1000640987&lt;/ref&gt; Though it was a predominantly black organization, Hopper joined the Manhattan Anti-Slavery Society in 1841. This organization protested all-white memberships of other societies, including the Ladies' New York City Anti-Slavery Society. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DXysBwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=%22abigail+hopper%22&amp;ots=BIpn4EsVgH&amp;sig=ZP5xanylmLqPUAUzASckAUk9CrE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22abigail%20hopper%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and Family==
On February 14, 1833, Abigail Hopper married James Sloan Gibbons, a fellow Hicksite Quaker from New York, who was also an ardent abolitionist. In 1836, the couple moved to New York City, where they had six children -- William, Sarah, Julia, Lucy, Isaac, and James. Two of their sons, Isaac and James, died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt; http://asp6new.alexanderstreet.com/was2/was2.object.details.aspx?dorpid=1000640987 &lt;/ref&gt; A third died suddenly after an accident while he was attending [[Harvard University]]. Their daughters included Sarah Emerson Gibbons, who published an edited collection of her mother's letters and a short biography of her, and Lucy Gibbons (who married a Mr. Morse and had a family).&lt;ref name="Admin"&gt;[http://www.swarthmore.edu/Library/friends/ead/5174ahgi.xml Abby Hopper Gibbons Papers, 1824-1992: Administrative and Other Descriptive Information"], Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College, 1996, Retrieved 28 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quaker Rejection==
Some Quaker yearly meetings divided due to influences from Deism, as well as differences between urban and rural members. In 1841, the New York Monthly Meeting, which was dominated by Hicksites, disowned [[Isaac Hopper]], her father, and James Sloan Gibbons, her husband, for their writing and other activities against slavery. The following year Abigail Hopper Gibbons resigned from the Meeting in protest, also removing her and James' four minor children. She and her family maintained Quaker practices and faith but did not rejoin the Meeting.&lt;ref name="Swarthmore"/&gt;

==Women's Prison Association==
Abigail Hopper Gibbons became involved in a variety of social reform movements. For twelve years in New York, she was also president of a German industrial school for street children. In 1845, she and her father founded the [[Women's Prison Association]] (WPA) of New York City. She lobbied the city government for improvements in the city's prisons, advocated the hiring of police matrons, and urged the construction of separate prisons for women, as they were housed in the same facilities as men. She frequently visited the various prisons in and about New York.

Under her leadership, in 1853 the [[Women's Prison Association]] separated from its parent, the Prison Association, and Gibbons obtained a New York State charter for her group. She led an aggressive program of legislative lobbying at the city and state level to improve prison conditions for women. She protested jail overcrowding and demanded that women prisoners be searched only by female matrons. She also believed that it would be beneficial for her proposed female prisons to be run by women as well. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=upLgBQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22abigail+hopper%22&amp;ots=VHNQAixeVw&amp;sig=zb5dfwvFubytNlNlpLIAVPoPvSw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22abigail%20hopper%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War==
With the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], Gibbons knew that nurses would be needed to care for the wounded. The [[United States Sanitary Commission]] was established in 1861, shortly after the Civil War began, to recruit nurses and to provide adequate medical care to the Union wounded. It would undertake numerous fundraising efforts to raise money for these purposes. When the Commission set up a training base at [[Davids' Island (New York)|David's Island Hospital]] in New York, Gibbons was among the trainees. She worked closely with contraband slaves who supported the Union's effort. These formerly enslaved people had often escaped from the South and sought refuge with the Union. Hopper helped them with childbirth and any other familial issues. She also collected donations from those in the North and gave them to the contraband slaves. Additionally, she used her wages to help pay for medical expenses encountered by patients who resided in a contraband camp. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DXysBwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=%22abigail+hopper%22&amp;ots=BIpn4EsVgH&amp;sig=ZP5xanylmLqPUAUzASckAUk9CrE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22abigail%20hopper%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

She traveled to Washington D.C., to help at the Washington Office Hospital, where she aided wounded officers and distributed supplies. She also helped to establish two field hospitals in Virginia. At [[Point Lookout, Maryland]], the federal government took over a hotel and 100 guest cottages, converting them into a hospital complex with accommodations for 1500 soldiers. It was named Hammond General Hospital. Gibbons vied with [[Dorothea Dix]], the Union Superintendent of Nurses, for control of the hospital. She finally gained an appointment as its head matron. In 1863 she left the facility after the hospital was adapted for use as the [[Point Lookout Confederate Prison]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In New York City, social tensions increased with the imposition of the draft. Many Irish immigrant working men did not support the war or abolition of slavery; they resented being drafted when wealthier men could pay for substitutes to take their places. With the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of 1863, they feared more job competition by blacks and the loss of work or being driven to lower wages. During the [[New York Draft Riots]], ethnic Irish led mob attacks against individual blacks, their residences and businesses, as well as the [[Colored Orphan Asylum]] in the largest civil insurrection in United States history.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, E. (1988). ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877'', The New American Nation series'', pp. 32-33, New York: Harper &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt; They also attacked residences of known white abolitionists and prominent Republicans. On Tuesday, July 14, 1863, the Gibbons' Manhattan home at 19 Lamartine Place&lt;ref&gt;Save Lamartine Place [http://savelamartineblockschelseaw29w30nyc.blogspot.com/2007/10/lamartine-blocks-w29th-and-w30th.html website]&lt;/ref&gt; (now 339 West 29th Street) was burned and destroyed by rioters.&lt;ref&gt;McCague, James (1968). ''The Second Rebellion: The New York City Draft Riots of 1863'', pp. 124-125. New York: Dial Press.&lt;!-- isbn needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Iver (1990). ''The New York City Draft Riots: Their Significance for American Society and Politics in the Age of the Civil War''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- isbn needed --&gt;

==Post-war==
Following the war, Gibbons founded the Labor and Aid Society, which aided returning veterans find work. To further her mission with women prisoners, she co-founded The Isaac T. Hopper Home, named for her father. It assisted former women prisoners to integrate into society after their release.&lt;ref name="Swarthmore"/&gt; As a result of her working on notable social reform movements, Gibbons corresponded with other nationally prominent leaders, including [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Lydia Maria Child]], and [[Joseph H. Choate]].&lt;ref name="Swarthmore"/&gt;

Her concern for women and children led Gibbons to found the New York Diet Kitchen (to serve infants, the elderly and the poor). She had also served as president of the New York Committee for the Prevention and Regulation of Vice, directed to control prostitution, drinking and gambling.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Death==
Gibbons died of pneumonia in New York in 1893, aged 91. She was eulogized in her obituary as "one of the most remarkable women of the century" for her work in noted reform movements. &lt;ref&gt; http://asp6new.alexanderstreet.com/was2/was2.object.details.aspx?dorpid=1000640987&lt;/ref&gt; She is interred at [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

==Legacy==
*Her daughter Sarah Emerson Gibbons edited and wrote a biography of Abigail Hopper Gibbons, published in 1896, which was based in part on her letters.
*The WPA has continued, providing programs through which women can acquire the life skills needed to gain and keep employment, manage finances, and to make good choices for themselves and their families. It is the nation's oldest advocacy organization working exclusively with women prisoners.

'''Adepeju Opeyemi Jaiyeoba''' (born November 1983) is a [[Nigeria]]n social entrepreneur and activist who created the [[Brown Button Foundation]] as well as Mother's Delivery Kit which creates low cost health care options and delivery kits containing basic sterile supplies for expectant mothers in [[Nigeria]].

==Life==
Jaiyeoba trained as a [[lawyer]] and attended [[Obafemi Awolowo University]] Ile-Ife.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; She also has background training in Business and Entrepreneurship from the [[University of Texas]] at Austin USA as well as the Coady International Institute, Canada.

Jaiyeoba's mission to reduce maternal and child mortality was as a result of the death of a close friend during childbirth in 2011 and reports of another. She found out that 145 women die in childbirth and 2,300 children die before reaching the age of five in Nigeria.&lt;ref name="guard"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2015/mar/27/ten-mins-with-adepeju-jaiyeoba-maternity-campaigner|title=10 minutes with: Adepeju Jaiyeoba, maternity campaigner|last=Minter|first=Harriet|date=2015-03-27|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mothers Deliver.jpg|thumb|Brown Button Foundation kit]]

Jaiyeoba was mentioned by [[Barack Obama]] in his address in 2014 to the Young African Leaders Presidential Summit in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and was also hosted at the [[White House]] in 2015. In 2014 they started delivering birth kits having seen the damage that lack of sterile supplies such as rusty blades used for severing umbilical cords during childbirth can have. By 2015 they had distributed 8,000 kits&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; and by 2017, 300,000.&lt;ref name=aw2017/&gt;

In 2017 she gave a [[TEDx talk]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=How to reform the health care system {{!}} Adepeju Jaiyeoba {{!}} TEDxGbagada|date=2017-06-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF_o2gtrlZY|accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has spoken at a number of local and international events and continues to inspire young people across Africa to action.

'''Armando Hart Dávalos''' (June 13, 1930 – November 26, 2017)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/armando-hart-historic-cuban-revolutionary-figure-dies/2017/11/26/07df965c-d305-11e7-9ad9-ca0619edfa05_story.html "Armando Hart, historic Cuban Revolutionary figure, dies"] (''[[The Washington Post]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Cuba]]n [[politician]] and a [[Communist]] leader. His grandfather was born in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[United States|USA]] and emigrated to Cuba as a child.

==Biography==
Before the [[Cuban Revolution]] which ousted President [[Fulgencio Batista]], Hart studied to be a lawyer at the [[University of Havana]]. While there, he became politically active and would soon join [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Che Guevara]] in their fight against Batista. As Castro and Che Guevara were leading the [[guerrilla warfare]] in the Cuban mountains and [[Cuban moist forests|jungles]], Hart went onto become one of the main organizers of the revolutionary movement in the cities.

When Batista was finally overthrown, Hart was made the first Minister of Education of the Revolution, and later served as the Minister of Culture (1976-1997), as well as a member of the [[Politburo]] of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]].

In January 2005, Hart wrote an article on [[Joseph Stalin]], in which he denounced the ideas of [[Stalinism]] and its practice, while defending the ideas of [[Karl Marx]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], Fidel Castro, and [[Leon Trotsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistviewpoint.org/mayjun_05/mayjun_05_08.htm Infto at socialistviewpoint.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Armando Hart was the father of [[Celia Hart]].

He became minister of culture since the creation of that ministry on 1976 to 1997. He was then appointed director of the Office of José Martí′s Program. Hart was the president of the [[José Martí Cultural Society]] (Sociedad Cultural José Martí)&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.martiano.cult.cu José Martí Cultural Society website]&lt;/ref&gt; at the time of this death.

'''Arthur Garner''' (born 8 February 1851) was a theatrical entrepreneur, active in Australia.&lt;ref name=Mennell&gt;{{cite Australasia|Garner, Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Princess Theatre, Melbourne, Australia.jpg|thumb|The Princess's Theatre, Melbourne. Built in 1886 by Garner, Williamson &amp; Musgrove]]
Garner was born in [[Bath, Somerset]], England, where his father, Dr. Jonathan Garner (M.D. of Edinburgh) practised his profession, his mother being a Miss Cobden. Arthur Garner was articled to [[Charles J. Phipps]], the architect, whose connection was largely theatrical, he having erected no less than forty English theatres; from which circumstance may perhaps be traced the young pupil's gravitation to the stage, where he became a ''protégé'' of Mr. George Gordon, the scenic artist. From the paint-room Garner soon found his way to the footlights, and for some time appeared in various provincial companies.&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt;

==Early years==
In 1873 Garner arrived in [[Melbourne]], returning to London in 1876. In 1879 Garner began his career as an Australian entrepreneur by taking out "The London Comedy Company" (1879), of which Fred Marshall was the bright particular comic star and Mr. George Gordon the hardly less indispensable scenic artist.&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt; Garner opened Garner's Theatre (previously [[White's Rooms]]) in [[Adelaide]] in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/contributor/?id=407326 |title=Arthur Garner |publisher=AusStage |accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1881 Garner joined [[J. C. Williamson]], the eminent Australian-American actor, and [[George Musgrove]] in establishing the leading firm of Australasian managers, generally known as the "Trio," which has controlled a greater number of theatres and entered into engagements, dramatic and operatic, on a larger scale than has ever been attempted in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt; Their operations practically commenced at the [[Theatre Royal, Melbourne]], on July 1, 1882, with the production of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[Patience (opera)|''Patience'']]. Many eminent London ''artistes'' were introduced to the colonies under their regime; but the most substantial undertaking of Williamson, Garner &amp; Musgrove was the building of the new [[Princess Theatre, Melbourne|Princess's Theatre, Melbourne]], in 1886, regarded as one of the finest theatres in the world.

==Married Life==
Garner was twice married: first, to the noted English actress Blanche Stammers, who died in Melbourne in 1883; and, secondly, to Letitia Hill Martin, sister of [[Patchett Martin]], herself an accomplished ''littérateur'', and formerly a contributor to the Australian press.&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt;

They retired to England, living at 36 Kempshott-road, [[Streatham Common]], Surrey. He died sometime before 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article120696931 |title=Frederick de Belleville |newspaper=[[Sunday Times]] |issue=1335 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=20 August 1911 |accessdate=3 April 2016 |page=20 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur Liebehenschel''' ({{Audio|De-Arthur Liebehenschel.oga|listen}}; 25 November 1901 – 24 January 1948) was a commandant at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and [[Majdanek]] concentration camps during [[World War II]]. He was convicted of [[war crimes]] by the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland|Polish government]] following the war and executed in 1948.

==SS career==
Liebehenschel was born in Posen (now [[Poznań]]). He studied [[economics]] and [[public administration]]. Too young to serve in [[World War I]], in 1919 he was in the [[Freikorps]] "Grenzschutz Ost"; he served as a sergeant major in the German [[Reichswehr]] afterwards. In 1932, he joined the [[Nazi Party]], and in 1934 was joined the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], where he served in the  ''[[Totenkopfverbände]]''. Liebehenschel became the adjutant in the [[Lichtenburg concentration camp]], and two years later was transferred to the inspectorate of the concentration camps in Berlin. In 1942, when the [[SS Main Economic and Administrative Office]] was founded, Liebehenschel was assigned to the new Amtsgruppe D (Concentration Camps) as head of Office D I (Central Office).{{cn|date=July 2017}}

On 1 December 1943 Liebehenschel was appointed commandant of [[Auschwitz|Auschwitz I concentration camp]], succeeding [[Rudolf Höß]], and adjutant [[Robert Mulka]]. While continuing mass executions, he made also minor "improvements" including removing the [[standing cells]] and halting the selections to [[Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|gas chambers]] among regular prisoners.&lt;ref name="BankierMikhman2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Bankier|author2=Dan Mikhman|title=Holocaust Historiography in Context: Emergence, Challenges, Polemics and Achievements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aNzjTUT6jdYC&amp;pg=PA560|accessdate=30 June 2012|year=2008|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-965-308-326-4|pages=560–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hermann Langbein]], a prisoner at Auschwitz infirmary, "in general one could establish that even those SS members who were very bloodthirsty before became a bit more reserved because they realized that their fanaticism would not necessarily be tolerated anymore."&lt;ref name="BankierMikhman2008"/&gt; 

When Höß returned to Auschwitz, Liebehenschel was replaced as commandant on 8 May 1944, and appointed commandant of the already emptied Majdanek camp on 19 May 1944, succeeding [[Martin Gottfried Weiss]]. The camp was evacuated because of the Soviet advance into [[German-occupied Poland]]. Liebehenschel relocated to [[Trieste, Italy]] to the office of [[Odilo Globocnik]], ''Höhere SS- und Polizeiführer'' (HSSPF) for [[Operational Zone Adriatic Coast]] (OZAK). Liebehenschel became head of the SS Manpower Office there.

==Criminal conviction==

At the war's end, Liebehenschel was arrested by the U.S. Army and was [[extradition|extradited]] to [[Poland]]. After being convicted of [[crimes against humanity]] at the [[Auschwitz Trial]] in [[Kraków]], he was sentenced to death and subsequently executed by [[hanging]] on 24 January 1948.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/auschtrial.html|title=Auschwitz Trials (Cracow)|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|work=Auschwitz-Birkenau|year=2013|accessdate=24 April 2013|author=Hermann Langbein|quote=''Source:'' Encyclopaedia Judaica''.

(1965); Brand, in: ''Yad Vashem Bulletin'', 15 (1964), 43–117.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Liebehenschel had one son and three daughters by his first wife, Gertrud,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Moorhead|first=Joanna|title=My father, the Auschwitz commandant|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=20 June 2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/20/barbara-cherish-auschwitz|accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zdf&gt;{{Cite web|last=Dreykluft|first=Friederike|title=Die Schuld des Vaters getragen|work=History|publisher=ZDF|date=5 November 2002|url=http://history.zdf.de/ZDFde/inhalt/6/0,1872,2021382,00.html?dr=1|accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the youngest of whom, Barbara Cherish (born 1943), now lives in the [[United States]]. 

In 2009, she published ''My father, the Auschwitz commandant'', in which she outlined actions by Liebehenschel that improved the prisoners' lives, but also discussed his participation in a [[genocide|genocidal]] system.&lt;ref name="wife"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8210135.stm|title=The child of Auschwitz's Kommandant|last=Cacciottolo|first=Mario|date=16 November 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=16 November 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116102510/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8210135.stm|archivedate=16 November 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with another daughter, Antje, she was interviewed in 2002 in [[ZDF]] about living with their father's guilt.&lt;ref name=zdf/&gt; Liebehenschel had a son by his second wife, Anneliese. Liebehenschel's first wife, whom he left during the war, suffered from mental health issues after the war and committed suicide in a hospital for the mentally ill in 1966.&lt;ref name="wife"/&gt;

After speaking with Randy Alfred, a friend and editor of the ''[[San Francisco Sentinel]]'', Campbell agreed to write a column, "to demystify the AIDS story".&lt;ref name="Pacifica Radio"/&gt; In his first article, on December 10, 1981, he proclaimed himself to be the "KS Poster Boy"&lt;ref name="Shilts PT138–39"/&gt; (later "AIDS Poster Boy"),&lt;ref name="Star Pharmacy Plaque"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shilts PT575"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BAR obit 1984-08-23"/&gt; becoming the first person in the US to publicly disclose that he was suffering from "gay cancer",&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkowitz"/&gt; writing:&lt;ref name="Shilts PT138–39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sentinel column #1"/&gt;
{{Quote |text=The purpose of the poster boy is to raise interest and money in a particular cause, and I do have aspirations of doing that regarding gay cancer. I'm writing because I have a determination to live. You do, too — Don't you? }}

This article turned into a regular column in the ''Sentinel'' — and syndicated in newspapers serving the LGBT community nationwide — describing his experiences.&lt;ref name="BAR obit 1984-08-16"/&gt; On January 10, 1982, Campbell was interviewed by Alfred for ''The Gay Life'' program on [[KSAN (FM)|KSAN-FM]], with doctors Marcus Conant and [[Paul Volberding]]; the interview has been archived by the [[GLBT Historical Society]].&lt;ref name="Gayback search"&gt;The [[GLBT Historical Society]]'s "[http://www.glbthistory.org/archives/audio-search/ Gayback Machine]" search does not produce persistent URLs, but searching for "Bobbi Campbell" in 1981 will bring up the appropriate episode, dated 1982-01-10 and captioned "Marcus Conant, M.D. and Paul Volberding, M.D., U.C.

Campbell joined the [[Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence]]&lt;ref name="Star Pharmacy Plaque"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schietinger p147"/&gt; at the time of the health crisis in early 1982; in his "sister" persona as Sister Florence Nightmare RN,&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andriote"/&gt; he co-authored the first San Francisco [[safe sex|safer sex]] manual, ''Play Fair!'', written in plain [[sex-positive movement|sex-positive]] language, using humor to leaven practical advice.&lt;ref name="Schietinger p147"/&gt; The Sisters were early awareness and fundraisers for the oncoming AIDS pandemic and continue to raise awareness of [[reproductive health|sexual health]]; many Orders regularly pass out [[condom]]s and participate in events to educate people on sexual health issues.&lt;ref name="sistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesisters.org/content/sistory |title=Sistory |publisher=[[Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725230125/http://www.thesisters.org/content/sistory |deadurl=yes |date=2010 |archivedate=25 July 2011 |accessdate=17 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1982, on the invitation of Conant and Volberding,&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andriote"/&gt; Campbell and [[Dan Turner (AIDS activist)|Dan Turner]], who had just himself been diagnosed with KS,&lt;ref name="Andriote"/&gt; attended what turned out to be the founding meeting of the KS/AIDS Foundation, which later became the [[San Francisco AIDS Foundation]],&lt;ref name="Andriote"/&gt; of which Campbell then served on the board.&lt;ref name="Smith &amp; Siplon"/&gt; Campbell also became involved with the [[Shanti Project]] (which moved from its original focus, supporting people with terminal cancer, to help provide emotional support to people diagnosed with AIDS coming to terms with death)&lt;ref name="Helquist"&gt;Interview with [[Michael Helquist]], journalist of the early AIDS epidemic in San Francisco, on March 24, 1995, by Sally Smith Hughes — in {{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/aidsepidemicsf01bancrich/#page/30 |title=The AIDS Epidemic in San Francisco: The Response of the Nursing Profession, 1981–1984, volume I |publisher=Regional Oral History Office, The Bancroft Library, [[University of California, Berkeley]] |year=1999 |page=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schietinger p153–5"&gt;Interview with [[Helen Schietinger]], nurse coordinator of UCSF's first AIDS clinic, on January 30, 1995, by Sally Smith Hughes — in {{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/aidsepidemicsf01bancrich/#page/152 |title=The AIDS Epidemic in San Francisco: The Response of the Nursing Profession, 1981–1984, volume I |series=The San Francisco AIDS Oral History Series |publisher=Regional Oral History Office, The Bancroft Library, [[University of California, Berkeley]] |year=1999 |pages=153–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and persuaded reluctant physicians to allow him to meet and counsel AIDS patients at Conant's KS clinic.&lt;ref name="Schietinger p153–5"/&gt;

== The People With AIDS Movement ==
{{Main|People With AIDS}}
In 1982, Campbell and Turner convened a meeting that spawned [[People With AIDS]] San Francisco,&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkowitz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith &amp; Siplon"/&gt; founding the "People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement" or PWA Movement,&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkowitz"/&gt; rapidly followed by [[Michael Callen]] and [[Richard Berkowitz]], authors of ''[[How to Have Sex in an Epidemic]]'', in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Smith &amp; Siplon"/&gt; As well as arguing that people with AIDS should expect to participate actively in the response to the AIDS crisis, the PWA Movement rejected the terms "AIDS victim" and "AIDS patient," as Campbell explained in interviews, for example:&lt;ref name="Pacifica Radio"/&gt;

{{Quote |text=The ''[[Bay Area Reporter|BAR]]'' ran a story on a friend of mine&amp;nbsp;... the headline read "Coalition treasurer KS victim" and my friend, who is the subject of this interview, was very unhappy because the implication of "KS victim" means the bus has run over you and you're laying there in the street, flattened. And he's very much alive; so am I. I do not feel like a "victim." }}

With other members of People With AIDS San Francisco, Campbell organized the first [[candlelight vigil|candlelight march]] to bring attention to the plight of people with AIDS and to remember those who had died of AIDS.&lt;ref name="Berkowitz"/&gt; On May 2, 1983, they marched behind a banner of "Fighting for our lives" for the first time,&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkowitz"/&gt; drawing around 10,000 people. On May 23, 1983, People With AIDS San Francisco voted to send Campbell and Turner to the Fifth National Lesbian and Gay Health Conference, at which the Second National AIDS Forum would be held.&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt;

Campbell and his colleagues' push to persuade [[AIDS service organization|service organizations]] to sponsor gay men with AIDS to attend the Conference was a key moment in the People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement.&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andriote"/&gt; Michael Callen subsequently wrote that, despite a growing sense of being patronised,&lt;ref name="Smith &amp; Siplon"/&gt; it had not occurred to the AIDS-diagnosed New Yorkers to "be anything more than the passive recipients of the genuine care and concern";&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andriote"/&gt; once people with AIDS realised they could advocate for themselves, lessons learned from the [[second-wave feminism|feminist]] and the [[civil rights movement]] helped with a more-widespread acceptance of the notion of self-empowerment.&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andriote"/&gt;

The national PWA movement came fully together when Campbell took charge of a discussion&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Survive a Plague p107–8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andriote"/&gt; where, with Callen, Turner and others,&lt;ref name="Denver Principles attendees"&gt;Those in attendance included:
* From San Francisco: Bobbi Campbell, [[Dan Turner (AIDS activist)|Dan Turner]] (1948–90), Bobby Reynolds (died 1987) and [[Michael Helquist]] representing his recently-deceased partner Mark Feldman
* From New York City: Phil Lanzaratta (died 1986), [[Michael Callen]] (1955–93), [[Richard Berkowitz]], Artie Felson, Bill Burke, Bob Cecchi (1942–91), Matthew Sarner [[Master of Social Work|M.S.W.]], Tom Nasrallah
* From Los Angeles: Gar Traynor
Plus "someone named Elbert from Kansas City by way of Houston; and one individual from Denver whose name we unfortunately cannot recall". (See "Remembering Bobbi Campbell" from ''The Daily Seyahatname'' and "A History of the PWA Self-Empowerment Movement" by Callen and Turner.)&lt;/ref&gt; he drafted the [[Denver Principles]], the defining manifesto of the PWA Movement,&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkowitz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Star Pharmacy Plaque"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith &amp; Siplon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andriote"/&gt; which, again, start with the rejection of the terms "victim" and "patient."&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith &amp; Siplon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andriote"/&gt; Campbell and the San Franciscans had different thoughts on the origin ([[etiology]]) of AIDS from Callen and the New Yorkers — Campbell described as "crazy" the idea that AIDS was caused by promiscuity,&lt;ref name="Pacifica Radio"/&gt; a perspective espoused by Callen and Berkowitz (and their physician [[Joseph Sonnabend]]) at the time&lt;ref name="We Know Who We Are"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://richardberkowitz.com/tag/we-know-who-we-are/ |title=We Know Who We Are: Two Gay Men Declare War on Promiscuity |author1=[[Michael Callen]] |author2=[[Richard Berkowitz]] |author3=Richard Dworkin |work=[[New York Native]] |issue=Issue 50, November 8–21, 1982 |accessdate=November 17, 2016 }} Linked from {{cite web |url=https://richardberkowitz.com/2010/06/29/safe-sex-writing-1982-2008/ |title=My Safe Sex Writing 1982–2010 |author=[[Richard Berkowitz]] |date=June 29, 2010 |accessdate=November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paternotte &amp; Tremblay"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aPiqCwAAQBAJ&amp;ots=k8lmYI2KgR&amp;pg=PT91 |title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Lesbian and Gay Activism |author1=David Paternotte |author2=Manon Tremblay |publisher=Routledge |date=3 March 2016 |isbn=978-1-317-04290-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amfAR: Joseph Sonnabend"&gt;{{cite web |title=2000 Honoring with Pride: Joseph Sonnabend, M.D |url=http://www.amfar.org/spotlight/article.aspx?id=4550 |publisher=[[amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research]] |date=2000 |accessdate=26 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; — and the Denver Principles represent a "careful synthesis" of these two positions:&lt;ref name="Wright 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As Joe Wright explained in footnote 63 to his 2013 article in ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'': "For example, the 'recommendations for all people' would have been easy points of agreement; the last of the 'recommendations for people with AIDS,' on [[sexual ethics]], underlines their agreements about [[safe sex]] but without delving into the language of 'promiscuity' or its rebuttals; and the second recommendation for health care providers appears to be a gentle assertion of [[Michael Callen|Callen]]'s concerns about [[etiology]], while the third likely reflects Campbell's own approach to how to be a clinician, and would have been the sort of instruction a progressive nursing educator might have given at the time."&lt;/ref&gt;

The activists — in an echo of the [[Lavender Menace]] [[radical feminism|radical feminists]] storming the [[National Organization for Women|NOW]] convention stage in 1970&lt;ref name="How to Survive a Plague PA109"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=I31ODAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=bobbi%20campbell&amp;pg=PA109 |title=How to Survive a Plague: The Story of How Activists and Scientists Tamed AIDS |author=[[David France (writer)|David France]] |publisher=Pan Macmillan |date=December 1, 2016 |accessdate=September 17, 2017 |pages=109–10 |isbn=978-1-5098-3941-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; — decided to storm the stage of the closing session of the Second National AIDS Forum in order to present the Denver Principles. As each of the 11 men read out one of the 11 statements, they did so with the "Fighting for our lives" banner behind them, from the San Francisco march earlier that month; these words became the slogan of the PWA Movement.&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Survive a Plague p107–8"/&gt;

After the conference, Campbell flew to New York with Callen, Berkowitz and Artie Felson, organizing and planning for local and national PWA organizations on the plane.&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andriote"/&gt; On arrival, they organized a PWA organization in the city despite initial opposition from the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]].&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt; They also planned a national PWA organization&lt;ref name="Andriote"/&gt; which opened in New York City in June 1984. PWA-New York went on to create the first safer sex poster to appear in a [[gay bathhouse]] in the city.&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt;

In June 1984, the annual [[San Francisco Pride|San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade]] was dedicated for the first time to people with AIDS. [[Dykes on Bikes]] have led the parade since the mid-1970s and People With AIDS followed immediately behind.&lt;ref name="Callen &amp; Turner"/&gt;

After being criticised for omitting any coverage of a [[Madison Square Garden]] benefit in April 1983, ''The New York Times'' increased its coverage of AIDS, setting the tone for an increase across print media.&lt;ref name="Nelkin 1991"/&gt; One of the most high-profile early pieces introducing AIDS to the heterosexual community was the cover article of the August 8, 1983, edition of ''[[Newsweek]]'', showing Campbell and his lover Bobby Hilliard and headlined "EPIDEMIC: The Mysterious and Deadly Disease Called AIDS May Be the Public Health Threat of the Century.

At the first Clinical Nursing Conference on AIDS, in [[Washington, D.C.]], on October 7, 1983, Campbell presented a [[poster session]], "dressed for the part" in white pants and a [[lab coat]].&lt;ref name="How to Survive a Plague p115–6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UCSF A&amp;SC"/&gt; The poster session was designed to help clinicians and nurses understand the message of the Denver Principles, about respect for people with AIDS, rather than considering them as "victims."&lt;ref name="How to Survive a Plague p115–6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UCSF A&amp;SC"/&gt; While at the conference, he attended a talk by an [[infection control]] nurse at the [[National Institutes of Health]] where he discovered the agency's "maximum awareness" policy recommended the use of [[electric green]] "AIDS Precaution" tags on AIDS patients' rooms, blood tubes and laundry.&lt;ref name="How to Survive a Plague p115–6"/&gt; With Artie Felson, he shouted his disgust at the "creepy" policy from the back of the room&lt;ref name="How to Survive a Plague p115–6"/&gt; and arranged an impromptu meeting of the National Association of People With AIDS, where they decided to pay visit to Heckler at her [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]] office.&lt;ref name="How to Survive a Plague p115–6"/&gt; They spoke with Shelley Lengel, a spokesperson for the new National AIDS Helpline, however Lengel did not call them back with further information about the policy.&lt;ref name="How to Survive a Plague p115–6"/&gt;

In January 1984, when [[Dan White]], the [[Moscone–Milk assassinations|assassin]] of gay San Francisco Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]] and Mayor [[George Moscone]], was due to be paroled, Campbell and Hilliard stood outside [[Soledad State Prison]].&lt;ref name="BAR obit 1984-08-23"/&gt; As White had been transported to Los Angeles for fear of retributive attacks,&lt;ref name="WaPo: Dan White"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/10/23/dan-white-and-his-citys-tragedy/aa148db5-c915-4b24-bcae-d24435fea11f/ |title=Dan White and His City's Tragedy |author=Cynthia Gorney |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 23, 1985 |accessdate=November 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UPI: Dan White"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/12/31/Officials-fear-for-paroled-assassins-life/2097441694800/ |title=Officials fear for paroled assassin's life |author=Susan Goldfarb |agency=[[United Press International]] |date=December 31, 1983 |accessdate=November 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times: Dan White"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-10-25/local/me-14269_1_dan-white |title=Parole agent recalls lonely Encino exile of Dan White |author=Allan Jalon |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 25, 1985 |accessdate=November 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; attendant media had little to cover beyond Campbell with a sign reading "Dan White's homophobia is more deadly than AIDS,"&lt;ref name="BAR obit 1984-08-23"/&gt; bringing further national attention to the health crisis.&lt;ref name="BAR obit 1984-08-23"/&gt;

Later that year, Campbell traveled with [[Angie Lewis]] to [[New Orleans]] for the annual convention of the [[American Nursing Association]] in June, where they gave a 45-minute or hour-long presentation — possibly a [[plenary session]] — about AIDS and HIV, having been invited at the last minute; Lewis suggested this may have been because the ANA were unsure about hosting the session.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Angie Lewis]], nurse educator in the San Francisco AIDS epidemic, on June 29, 1995, by Sally Smith Hughes — in {{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/aidsepidemicsf02bancrich#page/134 |title=The AIDS Epidemic in San Francisco: The Response of the Nursing Profession, 1981–1984, volume II |series=The San Francisco AIDS Oral History Series |publisher=Regional Oral History Office, The Bancroft Library, [[University of California, Berkeley]] |year=1999 |pages=135–36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell gave one of his last speeches at the National March for Lesbian and Gay Rights when the [[1984 Democratic National Convention]] was held in San Francisco in July.&lt;ref name="DNC YouTube"/&gt; He was introduced as a [[feminism|feminist]], a [[voter registration in the United States#Party affiliation|registered]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and a Person With AIDS; he had served as a board director of the National AIDS Foundation and on the steering committee of the Federation of AIDS-related Organizations, founded the National Association of People With AIDS and testified in front of [[United States congressional committee|Congressional subcommittees]].&lt;ref name="DNC YouTube"/&gt; Campbell told the crowd that he had hugged his boyfriend on the cover of ''Newsweek'', and then kissed Hilliard on stage, "to show Middle America that gay love is beautiful," criticising the [[Christian right]] for using scripture to justify their [[homophobia]].&lt;ref name="DNC YouTube"/&gt; After criticising the lack of progress being made by the Reagan administration, he held 15 seconds of silence for the 2,000 who had died of AIDS at that point "and [for] those who will die before this is over," before laying out a series of concerns for politicians to address — including increased funding for both research and support services and a warning of the potential for discrimination with the advent of a [[diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|test for HTLV-3]] (now known as HIV) — and appealing to all candidates in the [[United States elections, 1984|upcoming elections]] to meet with people with AIDS.&lt;ref name="DNC YouTube"/&gt;

Two weeks later, Campbell appeared on ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' in a live satellite interview with [[Dan Rather]].&lt;ref name="Inglis"/&gt; While the rumors and fear of AIDS had reached a mainstream audience, the facts had not yet, so Campbell was placed in a glass booth, with technicians refusing to come near him to wire up microphones for the interview.&lt;ref name="Inglis"/&gt;

Two days later, the city closed Castro Street for Campbell's [[funeral cortège]],&lt;ref name="BAR obit 1984-08-23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Survive a Plague p153–4"/&gt; where 1,000 people gathered to remember Campbell.&lt;ref name="BAR obit 1984-08-23"/&gt; A "reverential chant" by the [[Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence]] was followed by several speeches, including Conant and Hilliard as well as Campbell's parents and local performers (including [[Lea DeLaria]] and [[Holly Near]])&lt;ref name="How to Survive a Plague p153–4"/&gt; and an audio recording of [[Paul Boneberg]] introducing Campbell at the National March for Lesbian and Gay Rights a month earlier.&lt;ref name="BAR obit 1984-08-23"/&gt; In his August 23 obituary in the ''Bay Area Reporter'', Allen White described the event as "exactly what should be expected to remember a hero in a crisis."&lt;ref name="BAR obit 1984-08-23"/&gt; ''The Gay Life'' radio show on [[KSAN (FM)|KSAN-FM]], presented by Randy Alfred, Campbell's editor at the ''Sentinel'', covered his memorial across two weeks, on September 16 and 23, 1984.&lt;ref name="The Gay Life 1984-09-16/23"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt0w10244m/entire_text/#c02-1.3.11.3.253 |title=Reel 247, Box 23 (''The Gay Life'' September 16, 1984) and Reel 248, Box 23 (''The Gay Life'' September 23, 1984) |work=Randy Alfred subject files and sound recordings (collection 1991-24) |publisher=[[GLBT Historical Society]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was taken back to [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] and interred at New Tacoma Cemetery in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5143">'''Credonia Mwerinde''' (born 1952) was the high priestess and co-founder of the [[Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God]], a [[sect]] that splintered from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Uganda]]. Before founding the movement she was a shopkeeper, [[brewer]] of [[banana beer]],&lt;ref name="MYST"&gt;Uganda Cult's Mystique Finally Turned Deadly Ian Fisher ''New York Times'' April 2, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and a prostitute.&lt;ref name="PREACH"/&gt;  Mwerinde was also a member of a religious group that was devoted to the [[Virgin Mary]]. She and two other group members approached [[Joseph Kibweteere]] in 1989, and said that the Virgin Mary had instructed him to take them in.&lt;ref name="FATE"&gt;Fateful Meeting Led to Founding of Cult in Uganda Henri E. Cauvin ''New York Times'' March 27, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Kibweteere did, and he was particularly struck by her claim of a [[Marian apparition]] near his home, which related to a vision he himself had five years earlier.&lt;ref name="PREACH"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/694729.stm The preacher and the prostitute] ''BBC News'' March 29, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Together Mwerinde and Kibweteere would found the Movement in 1989.&lt;ref name="FATE"/&gt;

Mwerinde was part of the trio that lead the sect, which included Kibweteere, and Dominic Kataribaabo, an [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]]. However Paul Ikazire, a sect leader who later returned to the Catholic Church, described her as being the true power in the Movement. He said, "The meetings were chaired by Sister Credonia, who was the de facto head of the group. Kibwetere was just a figurehead, intended to impose masculine authority over the followers and enhance the cult's public relations."&lt;ref name="POWER"&gt;The power behind the cult '' The Telegraph'' April 2, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Mwerinde was also the source of the sect's predictions of an [[apocalypse]] and the pronouncements that salvation could only be found with the Virgin Mary's messages.

The Movement grew rapidly and at its height membership was estimated as being between 1,000 and 4,000.&lt;ref name="FATE"/&gt; Defrocked Catholic priests and nuns joined and worked as [[theologians]]. The [[apocalypse]] was predicted to occur with the advent of the new [[millennium]]. After the Movement was evicted from Rwashamaire, it moved to an estate her father owned in the [[Kanungu District]].&lt;ref name="PREACH"/&gt; With the year 2000 approaching sect members sold their property and turned the profits over to group leadership.

When the world did not end by January 1, a crisis occurred in the Movement. Members began to ask questions and demand the return of their money and property. Police investigators believe that Movement leadership, particularly Mwerinde, began a purge of their followers culminating in the destruction of their Kanangu Church in a fire that killed all 530 inside.&lt;ref name="POWER"/&gt; Hundreds of bodies were also found at Movement properties across southwestern Uganda. Initially believed to be a [[mass suicide]], police later stated that they were investigating it as a [[mass murder]].&lt;ref name="POWER"/&gt;

Mwerinde is assumed to have survived the church conflagration. Ugandan authorities believe that she left the sect's Kanangu compound in the early hours of March 17. In April 2000, police issued an international warrant for her arrest in connection to the sect killings.&lt;ref name="POWER"/&gt;

In September 2011, Mwerinde and several other prognosticators who incorrectly predicted various dates for the end of world were jointly awarded an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for "teaching the world to be careful when making mathematical assumptions and calculations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/09/29/winners_of_the_2011_ig_nobel_awards/?rss_id=Boston.com+--+Massachusetts+news|title=Winners of the 2011 Ig Nobel Awards|publisher=Boston Globe|date=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wasabi alarm, beetle sex win Ig Nobel spoof prizes

{{Mongolian name|Dash|Byambasüren}}

'''Dashiin Byambasüren''' ({{lang-mn|Дашийн Бямбасүрэн}}; born June 20, 1942 in [[Binder, Khentii]]) is a Mongolian [[politician]] who was [[Prime Minister of Mongolia]] from 11 September 1990 to  21 July 1992, the first one to be appointed by a [[democracy|democratically]] elected parliament, as a member of the [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]]. He comes from a [[Buryats|Buryat]] background.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Rossabi,[http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/10360/10360.ch01.html Modern Mongolia - From Khans to Commissars to Capitalists]&lt;/ref&gt; He is married with six children.&lt;ref name="Profile in German"&gt;[http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~corff/im/WhoIsWho/WhoIsWho-20040703-5.html#ss5.94 Profile in German]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
An economist, Byambasüren served as the chief of the State Statistical Office and the Institute of Management, although his influence initially waned after the fall of his mentor [[Jambyn Batmönkh]]. By 1989 he had risen to the position of deputy head of the Council of Ministers and after the [[Mongolian legislative election, 1990|1990 elections]] (which were largely [[democracy|democratic]]) he was chosen as the final Prime Minister of the [[Mongolian People's Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Kotkin &amp; Bruce A. Elleman, ''Mongolia in the Twentieth Century: Landlocked Cosmopolitan'', p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; His ministry was noted as reforming&lt;ref&gt;Rossabi, op cit&lt;/ref&gt; but also as something of a [[technocracy]], featuring a number of former [[communists]] who had altered their positions to suit the new mood of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Kotkin &amp; Elleman, op cit, pp. 265-266&lt;/ref&gt; However he also developed a reputation for [[diplomacy]], visiting [[Germany]], [[Belgium]] and [[France]], as well as [[Moscow]] and a first visit by a Mongolian leader to [[China]] for over thirty years, during the course of his Premiership.&lt;ref name="Profile in German"/&gt; He was succeeded in 1992 by [[Puntsagiin Jasrai]]. Byambasüren sought to improve Mongolia's external relations and worked particularly closely with [[Japan]], which, along with the [[World Bank]], pledged $320 million to Mongolia under his premiership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/other/bluebook/1992/1992-3-1.htm 'Regional Situations and Relations with Japan: Asia-Pacific']&lt;/ref&gt;

He left the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party in October 1992, criticizing its continuing hegemony in the country and its close links to [[communist]] parties elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Profile in German"/&gt; He went on to form his own pro-democracy group, the Mongolian Democratic Renaissance Party (''Mongolyn Ardqilsan Särgään Mandalyn Nam''), in 1994.&lt;ref name="Profile in German"/&gt;

== Other activities ==
Later Byambasüren was at the forefront of campaigns to stop archaeologists from digging for the remains of [[Genghis Khan]]. Byambasüren attacked both the desecration of sacred ground that the digging caused and the private funding of the initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2940782.stm 'The hunt for Genghis Khan'] from [[bbc.co.uk]]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also served as a Professor at the Mongolian Academy of Management and Khan Uul University and President of the Mongolian Development Foundation and participated in the [[Earth Summit 2002]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/jsummit/html/prep_process/asiapacific_prep1/malaysia_roudtable_report.htm 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Desmond John Morris''' (born 24 January 1928) is an English [[Zoology|zoologist]], [[Ethology|ethologist]] and [[Surrealism|surrealist]] painter, as well as a popular author in human [[sociobiology]]. He is known for his 1967 book ''[[The Naked Ape]]'', and for his television programmes such as ''Zoo Time''.

==Early life==
Morris was born in [[Purton]], [[Wiltshire]], to Marjorie (née Hunt) and children's fiction author Harry Morris. In 1933, the Morrises moved to [[Swindon]] where Desmond developed an interest in [[natural history]] and writing. He was educated at [[Dauntsey's School]], a boarding school in Wiltshire.&lt;ref name="dmbiography"&gt;{{cite web| author=Williams, D. |title=Desmond Morris Biography| url=http://www.desmond-morris.com/biography.php| publisher=Desmond-morris.com| accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1946, he joined the [[British Army]] for two years of [[national service]], becoming a lecturer in [[fine arts]] at the [[Chiseldon|Chiseldon Army College]]. After being demobilised in 1948, he held his first one-man show of his own paintings at the [[Swindon Arts Centre]], and studied [[zoology]] at the [[University of Birmingham]]. In 1950 he held a surrealist art exhibition with [[Joan Miró]] at the London Gallery. He held many other exhibitions in later years&lt;ref name="dmbiography"/&gt;. Also in 1950, Desmond Morris wrote and directed two surrealist films, ''Time Flower'' and ''The Butterfly and the Pin''. In 1951 he began a doctorate at the [[Department of Zoology, University of Oxford]] in [[animal behaviour]].&lt;ref name="dmbiography"/&gt; In 1954, he earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] for his work on the reproductive behaviour of the ten-spined [[stickleback]].

==Career==
Morris stayed at Oxford, researching the reproductive behaviour of birds. In 1956 he moved to London as Head of the [[Granada TV]] and Film Unit for the [[Zoological Society of London]], and studied the picture-making abilities of apes&lt;ref name="dmbiography"/&gt;. The work included creating programmes for film and television on animal behaviour and other zoology topics. He hosted Granada TV's weekly ''[[Zoo Time]]'' programme until 1959, scripting and hosting 500 programmes, and 100 episodes of the show ''Life in the Animal World'' for [[BBC Two|BBC2]]&lt;ref name="dmbiography"/&gt;. In 1957 he organised an exhibition at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London, showing paintings and drawings composed by [[chimpanzee]]s. In 1958 he co-organised an exhibition, ''The Lost Image'', which compared pictures by infants, human adults, and apes, at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London. In 1959 he left ''[[Zoo Time]]'' to become the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]]'s Curator of Mammals&lt;ref name="dmbiography"/&gt;. In 1964 he delivered the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] on ''Animal Behaviour''. In 1967 he spent a year as executive director of the London [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]].&lt;ref name="dmbiography"/&gt;

Morris's books include ''[[The Naked Ape|The Naked Ape: A Zoologist's Study of the Human Animal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. (1967). ''The Naked Ape: A Zoologist's Study of the Human Animal'' (1st American ed.). New York: [[McGraw-Hill]].&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1967. The book sold well enough for Morris to move to [[Malta]] in 1968 to write a sequel and other books. In 1973 he returned to Oxford to work for the ethologist [[Niko Tinbergen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace Romano Harré|Harré, R.]] (2006). "Chapter 5: The Biopsychologists". ''Key Thinkers in Psychology'', pp. 125-132. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1973 to 1981, Morris was a Research Fellow at [[Wolfson College, Oxford]]&lt;ref name="sirc"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sirc.org/about/desmond_morris.html | title=Desmond Morris | publisher=[[Social Issues Research Centre]] | accessdate=1 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1979 he undertook a television series for [[Thames TV]], ''The Human Race'', followed in 1982 by ''Man Watching in Japan'', ''The Animals Road Show'' in 1986 and then several other series.&lt;ref name="dmbiography"/&gt; [[National Life Stories]] conducted an oral history interview (C1672/16) with Desmond Morris in 2015 for its Science and Religion collection held by the British Library.&lt;ref name=oralhistory&gt;[http://sounds.bl.uk/Oral-history/Science/021M-C1672X0016XX-0001V0 National Life Stories, 'Morris, Desmond (1 of 2) National Life Stories Collection: Science and Religion', The British Library Board, 2015].  Retrieved 9 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
When Morris was 14, his father was killed whilst serving in the armed forces, causing Morris to drift towards surrealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=My family values: Desmond Morris interview| newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/01/desmond-morris-family-values | accessdate=28 November 2012 | first=Alice | last=Douglas | date=1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His grandfather William Morris, an enthusiastic [[Victorian era|Victorian]] naturalist and founder of the Swindon local newspaper,&lt;ref name="dmbiography"/&gt; greatly influenced him during his time living in Swindon.
 
In July 1952, Morris married Ramona Baulch; they had one son, Jason.&lt;ref name="dmbiography"/&gt;  In 1978, Morris was elected Vice-Chairman of [[Oxford United F.C.]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

He was a [[homeless]] man who used to hunt passersby at a park in the city of [[San Cristóbal, Táchira|San Cristobal]], [[Táchira (state)|Táchira]] State. Once he was caught, he confessed to killing and eating at least 10 men over a period of two years preceding his arrest in 1999.

== Biography ==
Dorángel Vargas was born in 1956 to poor farmers. His priors include three arrests, two of them for minor offenses (theft of chickens and cattle). The third was acquired in 1995 when he was admitted to the Institute of Psychiatric Rehabilitation Peribeca for the murder of Baltazar Cruz Moreno, and the subsequent cannibalism of his body. He managed to escape from that center, and lead a seemingly normal life in poverty, without bothering anyone again.&lt;ref name="r1" /&gt;

It is believed that he was actively murdering between November 1998 and January 1999. Dorángel hunted victims with a tube-shaped spear and occasionally with rocks. He kept the parts that he could cook and usually buried the feet, hands and heads. It seemed that his primary targets were unsuspecting athletes and laborers working on the riverbank. He did not eat women or children. Since he had no place to store the human flesh, most of it would decompose quickly, which made him kill routinely.&lt;ref name=r2&gt;{{cite web |title=Dorancel Vargas El Comegente |url=https://cronicasdeltanato.wordpress.com/el-canibal-de-los-andes/ |accessdate=5 December 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 12, 1999, members of the [[Civil Defense]] found the remains of two young people and alerted the security forces. Searching around the same area, the remains of six more bodies were found. Hypotheses about the findings included the plot being a cemetery for corpses linked to drug gangs and even a burial ground for victims of Satanic cult rituals. The victims, after further investigation, were all found to have been missing persons. As the investigation progressed, Vargas became a suspect, An inspection of the Shack he was living on near the area, revealed several vessels containing human flesh and viscera prepared for consumption, along with three human heads and several feet and hands.

Once captured, he confessed to having killed and eaten at least 10 men over a period of two years since his arrest in 1999.&lt;ref name=r2 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2870">'''Dwight Yearwood''' (born May 3, 1959 in Dibe, [[Port of Spain]]) is a [[long-distance runner]] from [[Trinidad and Tobago]], who has completed 30 [[marathon]]s and 33 [[half marathon]]s in spite of  his [[disability]], becoming a symbol of hope to many locals.&lt;ref name=Symbol&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.catholicnews-tt.net/joomla/archives-2009/43-feature/107-fea1101091 |title=Example of faith, symbol of hope|first=Raymond|last=Syms|date=January 11, 2009|publisher=Trinidad and Tobago Catholic News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yearwood has represented his country in marathons in [[New York Marathon|New York]] (1987, 1988, and 1989) and in [[Barbados]] (1991, 1995).&lt;ref name=Marathon&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://legacy.guardian.co.tt/archives/2006-02-07/SA-1.html|title=Born to run|first=Kwame|last=Williams|date=February 1, 2006|publisher=Trinidad Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;    In 2008, Yearwood received a lifetime achievement award, the Alexander B.

Yearwood developed [[Polio]] shortly after his birth.  The disease left him with a permanent physical disability and a speech impediment.  He was placed in the care of his grandmother who became his source of strength and who taught him to do his best to be self-reliant as far as possible.  Dwight Yearwood’s inspiring story has been captured in the book, ''Dwight Yearwood – Polio…He survived and conquered'' by Anton LaFond.&lt;ref name=Dwight&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.guardian.co.tt/sport/2010/12/24/marathoner-yearwood-launches-book-tribute-his-grandmother|title=Marathoner Yearwood launches book|first=Clayton|last=Clarke|date=December 25, 2010|publisher=Trinidad Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elaine''' is a name shared by several different female characters in [[Arthurian legend]].

==Elaine of Astolat==
{{Main|Elaine of Astolat}}

Elaine of [[Astolat]], also known in some texts as Elaine the Fair or the Fair Maid of Astolat and (as ''[[The Lady of Shalott]]'' in [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Lord Alfred Tennyson]]'s same-titled poem) is a maiden who falls in unrequited love with Sir [[Lancelot]].

==Elaine of Benoic==
Elaine of Benoic (or Benwick) is the wife of [[King Ban]] and the mother of [[Lancelot]]. She is the sister of [[Evaine]], wife of King Bors of Gaunnes and mother of [[Sir Lionel]] and Sir [[Bors]]. Her husband dies of grief when his enemy [[Claudas]] attacks his city, and Elaine goes to attend to him. She sets the infant Lancelot down, and he is taken by the [[Lady of the Lake]], who raises him. Elaine sees her son for the first time in years just before she dies.

==Elaine of Corbenic==
{{main|Elaine of Corbenic}}

Elaine of [[Corbenic]] (also known as Amite, Heliaebel, Helaine, Perevida or Helizabel; identified as "The Grail Maiden" or "Grail Bearer") is the daughter of [[Fisher King|King Pelles]] and the mother of Sir [[Galahad]] by Sir [[Lancelot]]. She first appears in the Prose Lancelot (the [[Vulgate Cycle]]), but fully emerges as a character in Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte D'Arthur]]''. Her first significant action is showing the [[Holy Grail]] to Sir Lancelot.

==Elaine of Garlot==
Elaine of Garlot is the daughter of [[Gorlois]], [[List of legendary rulers of Cornwall|Duke of Cornwall]], and [[Igraine]]. She is a sister of [[Morgan le Fay]] and [[Morgause]] and a half-sister of [[King Arthur]]. She marries King [[Nentres of Garlot]] and has a son named [[Galeschin]], who becomes a [[Knight of the Round Table]], and a daughter named Elaine the Younger. 

Considering the actions of her sisters, she is remarkable in that she is otherwise unremarkable. It is assumed she stayed in her own lands and did little to help or hinder any of her siblings.

==Elaine of Listenoise==
Elaine of Listenoise is the daughter of King [[Pellinore]]. She kills herself after the death of her lover Sir Miles of the Laundes. 

Some modern authors, such as [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] in ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'', combine or conflate her with Elaine of Corbenic, due to their shared name and the similarity of their fathers' names.

==Elaine the Peerless==
Elaine the Peerless is the niece of the Lord of the Fens and wife of Persides the Red of the Castle of Gazevilte.

==Elaine the Younger==
Elaine the Younger is the daughter of Elaine of Garlot and (usually) [[King Nentres]], and a niece of [[King Arthur]]. In some versions of the legend, she falls in love with Sir [[Percival]]. Other versions cast her as a child of [[King Lot]].

[[File:109.Ezra Reads the Law to the People.jpg|thumb|''Ezra Reads the Law to the People'', one of [[Gustave Doré's illustrations for La Grande Bible de Tours|Gustave Doré's illustrations for ''La Grande Bible de Tours'']]]]

'''Ezra''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|z|r|ə}}; {{lang-he-n|עזרא}}, ''{{transl|he|‘Ezrā}}'';&lt;ref&gt;"[God] helps" – [[Emil G. Hirsch]], [[Isaac Broydé]], "[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=578&amp;letter=E Ezra the Scribe]", ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' (Online)&lt;/ref&gt; fl. 480–440 BCE), also called '''Ezra the Scribe''' ({{Hebrew|עזרא הסופר}}, ''{{transl|he|Ezra ha-Sofer}}'') and '''Ezra the Priest''' in the [[Book of Ezra]], was a Jewish scribe (''[[sofer]]'') and priest (''[[kohen]]''). In [[Ancient Greek|Greco]]-[[Latin]] Ezra is called [[Esdras]]  ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἔσδρας}}). According to the Hebrew Bible he was a descendant of Sraya ({{bibleverse||Ezra|7:1|NIV}})&lt;ref&gt;In Ezra he is described as the son of Seraya.&lt;/ref&gt; the last [[High Priest]] to serve in the [[First Temple]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:18|NIV}}), and a close relative of [[Joshua the High Priest|Joshua the first High Priest]] of the [[Second Temple]] ({{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|5:40–41|NIV}} CJB and similar translations only; see also {{bibleverse||Ezra|3:2|NIV}}). He returned from [[Babylonian exile]] and reintroduced the [[Torah]] in Jerusalem ({{bibleverse||Ezra|7–10|NIV}} and {{bibleverse||Neh|8|NIV}}). According to [[1 Esdras]], a Greek translation of the Book of Ezra still in use in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], he was also a High Priest. Rabbinic tradition holds that he was an ordinary member of the priesthood.&lt;ref name="Ezra" group=&gt;{{cite web|title=1901 The Jewish Encyclopedia Complete vol. 5 |page=231|url=https://archive.org/details/1901TheJewishEncyclopediaIAachApocalypticLiterature_201605|website=Internet Archive|accessdate=15 May 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several traditions have developed over his place of burial. One tradition says that he is buried in al-Uzayr near [[Basra]] (Iraq), while another tradition alleges that he is buried in [[Tedef|Tadif]] near [[Aleppo]], in northern Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Tawil, Hayim &amp; Schneider, Bernard 2010, ''Crown of Aleppo: The Mystery of the Oldest Hebrew Bible Codex'', Philadelphia, Jewish Publication Society 2010, p. 63 {{ISBN|9780827608955}}; Laniado, David, ''Li-Qedošim ašer ba-areṣ'', Jerusalem 1980, p. 26 (Hebrew); Frenkel, Miriam, article: ''Atare pulḥan yehudiyyim be-ḥalab bi-yme ha-benayim ha-tikhoniyyim'', published in: ''Harel'' ({{Hebrew|הראל}}), Yaron, Assis, Yom Ṭov &amp; Frenkel, Miriam (eds.), ''Ereṣ u-mlo’ah: meḥqarim be-toledot qehillat aram ṣova'' (''ḥalab'') ''ve-tarbutah'', vol. I, Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 2009, pp. 174–75 (Hebrew); Khatib, Muḥammad Zuhair, ''Rabṭ al-Sabāba al-yamanī''.&lt;/ref&gt;

His name may be an abbreviation of {{Hebrew|עזריהו}} ''{{transl|he|Azaryahu}}'', "[[Jah|Yah]] helps". In the Greek [[Septuagint]] the name is rendered ''{{transl|grc|Ésdrās}}'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|Ἔσδρας}}}}), from which the Latin name {{lang|la|Esdras}} comes.

The [[Book of Ezra]] describes how he led a group of [[Babylonian captivity|Judean exiles]] living in [[Babylon]] to their home city of [[Jerusalem]] ({{bibleverse||Ezra|8.2–14|NIV}}) where he is said to have enforced observance of the Torah. He was described as exhorting the Israelite people to be sure to follow the Torah Law so as not to intermarry with people of particular different religions, a set of commandments described in the [[Pentateuch]].&lt;ref name="BrillPauly"&gt;Liwak, Rüdiger; Schwemer, Anna Maria. "Ezra". Brill's New Pauly.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;"Ezra". [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. 2007. ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''
&lt;/ref&gt;

Ezra, known as "Ezra the scribe" in [[Chazal]]ic literature,&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Kessler]], Neil Wenborn, ''A Dictionary of Jewish-Christian Relations'', [[Cambridge University Press]], p. 398&lt;/ref&gt; is a highly respected figure in [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopedia of Judaism'', "Ezra"&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Hebrew Bible==
The canonical [[Book of Ezra]] and [[Book of Nehemiah]] are the oldest sources for the activity of Ezra,&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; whereas many of the other books ascribed to Ezra (First Esdras, 3–6 Ezra) are later literary works dependent on the canonical books of Ezra and Nehemiah.

The books of [[Ezra–Nehemiah]] were originally one scroll.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh G. M. Williamson]], ''Ezra, Nehemiah'', Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 16 (Dallas:Word, 1985), pp. xxi–lii.&lt;/ref&gt; Later the Jews divided this scroll and called it First and Second Ezra. Modern Hebrew Bibles call the two books Ezra and Nehemiah, as do other modern Bible translations. A few parts of the Book of Ezra (4:8 to 6:18 and 7:12–26) were written in [[Aramaic]], and the majority in [[Hebrew]], Ezra himself being skilled in both languages.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Charlesworth – [http://www.ijco.org/?categoryId=28681 "Announcing a Dead Sea Scrolls Fragment of Nehemiah"] – ''The Institute for Judaism and Christian Origins'' – Retrieved 20 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Ezra was living in Babylon when in the seventh year ({{circa|457}} BCE) of [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes]], king of Persia, the king sent him to Jerusalem to teach the laws of God to any who did not know them. Ezra led a large body of exiles back to Jerusalem, where he discovered that Jewish men had been marrying non-Jewish women. He tore his garments in despair and confessed the sins of Israel before God, then braved the opposition of some of his own countrymen to purify the community by enforcing the dissolution of the sinful marriages. Some years later Artaxerxes sent Nehemiah (a Jewish noble in his personal service) to Jerusalem as governor with the task of rebuilding the city walls. Once this task was completed Nehemiah had Ezra read the Law of Moses (the [[Torah]]) to the assembled Israelites, and the people and priests entered into a covenant to keep the law and separate themselves from all other peoples.

==In later Second Temple period literature==

===1 Esdras===
[[1 Esdras]], probably from the late 2nd/early 1st centuries BCE, preserves a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] text of Ezra and a part of Nehemiah distinctly different from that of Ezra–Nehemiah – in particular it eliminates Nehemiah from the story and gives some of his deeds to Ezra, as well as telling events in a different order. Scholars are divided on whether it is based on Ezra–Nehemiah, or reflects an earlier literary stage before the combination of Ezra and Nehemiah accounts.

===Josephus===
The first-century Jewish historian [[Josephus]] deals with Ezra in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]''. He preferred 1 Esdras over the canonical Ezra–Nehemiah and placed Ezra as a contemporary of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]], son of [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] – rather than of Artaxerxes.&lt;ref name="Britannica3"&gt;"Esdras, First Book of." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt;

===The apocalyptic Ezra traditions===
The [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[2 Esdras|fourth book of Ezra]] (also called the second book of Esdras) was written c. CE 100, probably in [[Judeo-Aramaic language|Hebrew-Aramaic]]. It was one of the most important sources for [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish theology]] at the end of the 1st century. In this book, Ezra has a seven part prophetic revelation, converses with an [[angel]] of God three times and has four visions. Ezra, thirty years into the Babylonian Exile (4 Ezra 3:1 / 2 Esdras 1:1), recounts the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|siege of Jerusalem]] and the destruction of [[Solomon's Temple]].&lt;ref name="BrillPauly"/&gt; This would place these revelations in the year 557 BCE, a full century before the date given in the canonical Ezra. The central theological themes are "the question of theodicy, God's justness in the face of the triumph of the heathens over the pious, the course of world history in terms of the teaching of the four kingdoms,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Daniel|2:1|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Daniel|7:1|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Daniel|8:1|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; the function of the law, the eschatological judgment, the appearance on Earth of the heavenly Jerusalem, the [[Messianic Age|Messianic Period]], at the end of which the [[Messiah]] will die,&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=Kjv4Ezr.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=7&amp;division=div2 4 Ezra (Apocrypha), chapter 7, verse 29]&lt;/ref&gt; the end of this world and the coming of the next, and [[Last Judgment|the Last Judgment]]."&lt;ref name="BrillPauly" /&gt; Ezra restores the law that was destroyed with the burning of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. He dictates 24 books for the public (i.e. the Hebrew Bible) and another 70 for the wise alone (70 unnamed revelatory works).&lt;ref name="cox"&gt;Howard H. Cox, ''The Pentateuch: History Or Story?'', p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; At the end, he is taken up to [[heaven]] like Enoch and [[Elijah]].&lt;ref name="BrillPauly"/&gt; Ezra is seen as a new Moses in this book.&lt;ref name="BrillPauly"/&gt;

There is also another work, thought to be influenced by this one, known as the ''[[Greek Apocalypse of Ezra]]''.

==Ezra in rabbinic literature==
{{further|Ezra in rabbinic literature}}
[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 125.png|thumb|Woodcut for ''Die Bibel in Bildern'', 1860, by [[Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]].]]
Traditionally Judaism credits Ezra with establishing the [[Great Assembly]] of scholars and prophets, the forerunner of the [[Sanhedrin]], as the authority on matters of religious law. The Great Assembly is credited with establishing numerous features of contemporary traditional Judaism in something like their present form, including [[Torah reading]], the [[Amidah]], and celebration of the feast of [[Purim]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"&gt;[[Emil G. Hirsch]], [[Isaac Broydé]], "[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=578&amp;letter=E Ezra the Scribe]", ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' (Online)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rabbinic literature|Rabbinic]] traditions, Ezra is metaphorically referred to as the "flowers that appear on the earth" signifying the springtime in the national [[Jewish history|history of Judaism]]. A disciple of [[Baruch ben Neriah]], he favored study of the Law over the [[Second Temple of Jerusalem|reconstruction of the Temple]] and thus because of his studies, he did not join the first party returning to Jerusalem in the reign of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]]. According to another opinion, he did not join the first party so as not to compete, even involuntarily, with [[Joshua the High Priest|Jeshua ben Jozadak]] for the office of chief priest.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

According to Jewish tradition, Ezra was the writer of the [[Books of Chronicles]],&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud (''Baba Bathra'' 15a)&lt;/ref&gt; and is the same prophet known also as Malachi.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Aramaic [[Targum]] of [[Jonathan ben Uzziel|Yonathan ben Uzziel]] on the Prophet [[Malachi]] (Minor Prophets); Yehoshua b. Ḳarḥa (''Megillah'' 15a) .&lt;/ref&gt; There is a slight controversy within rabbinic sources as to whether or not Ezra had served as [[Kohen Gadol]].&lt;ref&gt;HaQoton, Reb Chaim [http://rchaimqoton.blogspot.co.il/2013/07/was-ezra-high-priest.html "Was Ezra a High Priest"] also printed in the [[Jewish Bible Quarterly]] (July 2013); see also [http://jbq.jewishbible.org/41-3-july-september-201/]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Babylonian Talmud]], Ezra the scribe is said to have enacted ten standing laws and orders,&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud (''Baba Kama'' 82a); Jerusalem Talmud (''Megillah'' 29a-b)&lt;/ref&gt; which are as follows: 1) That the public come together to read from the [[Torah|scroll of the Law]] on Sabbath days during the time of the afternoon oblation ([[Minchah]]), because of those travelling merchants who loiter in the closed shops in the street corners, and who may have missed the biblical lections that were read during the weekdays;&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], [[Mishne Torah]] (''Hilchot Tefillah'' 12:1)&lt;/ref&gt; 2) that the [[Beth din|courts]] be opened throughout the Jewish townships on Mondays and Thursdays; 3) that women do not wait beyond Thursday to launder their clothes, because of the honor due to the Sabbath day; 4) that men would accustom themselves to eat [cooked] garlic on the eve of the Sabbath (believed to enhance love between a man and his wife); 5) that women would rise up early on Friday mornings to bake bread, so that a piece of bread will be available for the poor; 6) that Jewish women in every place be girded with a wide belt (waist band), whether from the front or from behind, out of modesty; 7) that Jewish women, during their menses, wash and comb their hair three days prior to their purification in a ritual bath; 8) that the travelling merchants make regular rounds into the Jewish townships because of the honor due to the daughters of Israel; 9) that Jewish women and/or girls, as a precautionary measure, be accustomed to conversing with one another while one of their party goes out to relieve herself in the outhouse; 10) that men who may have suffered a seminal emission (especially after accompanying with their wives) be required to immerse themselves in a [[Mikveh|ritual bath]] before being permitted to read from the scroll of the Law.

In the Syrian village of [[Tedef]], a synagogue said to be the place where Ezra stopped over has been venerated by Jews for centuries. Another tradition locates his tomb near Basra, Iraq.

==Ezra in Christian traditions==
Early Christian writers occasionally cited Ezra as author of the apocalyptic books attributed to him. [[Clement of Alexandria]] in his ''[[Stromata]]'' referred to Ezra as an example of prophetic inspiration, quoting a section from 2 Esdras.&lt;ref&gt;The Apocryphal Apocalypse: the reception of the second book of Esdras Alastair Hamilton – 1999 p. 22 "that were part of the canon.13 Although Clement of Alexandria, who was writing in the late second and early third century, showed more interest in 1 Esdras, he cited 2 Esdras in his Stromata, referring to Esdras as an example of prophetic inspiration..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ezra in Islam==
{{main article|Uzair}}
In Islam he is known as [[Uzair]] ({{lang|ar|عُزَيْرٌ}}). He was mentioned in the [[Qur'an]]. Although he was not mentioned as one of the [[Prophets of Islam]], he is considered as one of them by some [[Muslim]] scholars, based on [[Islam]]ic traditions.&lt;ref name="shahid"&gt;But the Qur'an 9:30 quotes Jews as saying that he is the "son of God" {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5GiZqe3tI1gC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Encyclopaedia+of+Holy+Prophet+and+Companions|title=Encyclopaedia of Holy Prophet and Companions|last=Ashraf|first=Shahid|publisher=Anmol Publications Pvt.

&lt;/ref&gt; His tomb at [[Ezra's Tomb|Al-ʻUzair]] on the banks of the [[Tigris]] near [[Basra]], [[Iraq]], is a pilgrimage site for the local [[Marsh Arabs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://memrieconomicblog.org/bin/content.cgi?article=15# Environmental and Cultural Terrorism – The Destruction of Iraqi Marshes and Their Revival: Some Personal Reflections]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jameswbell.com/a012ezrastomb.html Ezra's Tomb]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Islamic scholars and modern Western academics do not view Uzair as "Ezra"; for example Professor Gordon Darnell Newby associates Uzair with Enoch and [[Metatron]]. On this [[Timothy Winter]] (Abdal Hakim Murad) and Gordon Darnell Newby [http://www.js.emory.edu/faculty/newby.htm] associate Uzair again with [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)]] and by extension [[Metatron]] the creator-angel or "lesser Yahweh".[http://www.marquette.edu/maqom/metatronyhwh.html]

=== Timeline ===
Scholars are divided over the chronological sequence of the activities of Ezra and Nehemiah. Ezra came to Jerusalem "in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the King".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezra|7:7|131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text does not specify whether the king in the passage refers to Artaxerxes I (465–424 BCE) or to [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] (404–359 BCE).&lt;ref name="igb"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Illustrated Guide to the Bible|last=Porter|first=J.R. |year= 2000|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-2278-7  |pages=115–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The dates of Nehemiah's and Ezra's respective missions, and their chronological relation to each other, are uncertain, because each mission is dated solely by a regnal year of an [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenian]] King Artaxerxes; and in either case we do not know for certain whether the [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes]] in question is Artaxerxes I (465–424 BCE) or [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] (404–359 BCE).

&lt;/ref&gt;  These difficulties have led many scholars to assume that Ezra arrived in the seventh year of the rule of Artaxerxes II, i.e. some 50 years after Nehemiah. This assumption would imply that the biblical account is not chronological. The last group of scholars regard "the seventh year" as a scribal error and hold that the two men were contemporaries.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Boederman, ''The Cambridge Ancient History'', 2002, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Gosta W. Ahlstrom argues the inconsistencies of the [[Bible|biblical]] tradition are insufficient to say that Ezra, with his central position as the 'father of Judaism' in the Jewish tradition, has been a later literary invention.&lt;ref&gt;Gosta W. Ahlstrom, ''The History of Ancient Palestine'', Fortress Press, p. 888&lt;/ref&gt; Those who argue against the historicity of Ezra argue that the presentation style of Ezra as a leader and lawgiver resembles that of Moses. There are also similarities between Ezra the priest-scribe (but not [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]]) and Nehemiah the secular governor on the one hand and Joshua and [[Zerubbabel]] on the other hand. The early 2nd-century BCE Jewish author [[Ben Sira]] praises Nehemiah, but makes no mention of Ezra.&lt;ref name="MaryJ1"/&gt;

[[Richard Elliott Friedman|Richard Friedman]] argued in his book ''Who Wrote the Bible?'' (p.&amp;nbsp;232 1997 edition) that Ezra is the one who redacted the Torah, and in fact effectively produced the first Torah.&lt;ref&gt;''Who Wrote the Bible?'' (Harper San Francisco) (1987, new preface 1997) {{ISBN|978-0060630355}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that even if one does not accept the documentary hypothesis, Ezra was instrumental in the start of the process of bringing the Torah together.&lt;ref&gt;The Canonization of the Pentateuch: When and Why?

'''Farouk Ahmed Sultan''' ({{lang-ar|فاروق سلطان}}; born 1941) was President of the [[Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt]], the highest judicial court in Egypt. He was appointed in 2009 by President [[Hosni Mubarak]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebanonwire.com/0907MLN/09072609AW.asp Egypt: Roadmap to the presidency]&lt;/ref&gt; and succeeded by [[Maher El-Beheiry]] in 2012.

Sultan's appointment was questioned by outside observers, who argued that he lacked experience in [[constitutional law]], and that much of his experience was in [[military law|military courts]] and state security courts. It was argued that his appointment was meant to place an ally of Mubarak at the head of the Supreme Constitutional Court in advance of the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2011|2011 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lynch.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/07/21/why_did_the_egyptian_regime_appoint_a_new_chief_justice Why did the Egyptian regime appoint a New Chief Justice?]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]], it was announced that Sultan would be a part of the interim government, along with the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]]. His role in the government was not immediately clear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2011/02/11/133685036/in-cairo-protesters-celebrate-greatest-day Analysis: What's Next For Egypt]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gergely Pongrátz''' ([[Gherla]], 18 February 1932 – [[Kiskunmajsa]], 18 May 2005) was a famous veteran of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. He was the commander of arguably the largest and perhaps the best-known group of [[freedom fighter]]s, at the Uprising's strongest and most lengthy point of [[resistance (military)|resistance]], [[Budapest|Budapest's]] [[The Battle of the Corvin Passage|Corvin Passage]] (''Corvin Köz''); between the 1 and 9 November 1956. Under his command, the Corvin Passage fighters destroyed at least a dozen Soviet tanks, and resisted several waves of assault.  Following the conflict, Pongrátz escaped capture and by 1957 had moved to the [[United States]] where he spent the majority of his [[exile]] until returning to Hungary in 1991. During his exile he was elected both Vice-Chairman and then Chairman of the [[Hungarian Freedom Fighters' Association]] (''Magyar Szabadságharcos Szövetség'').&lt;ref name = "obit"&gt;{{Citation | last = Partos | first = Gabriel | title = Gergely Pongrátz: Resistance fighter in the Hungarian Uprising | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/gergely-pongraacutetz-492324.html | publisher = [[The Independent]] (Obituaries) | date = 2005-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Battle of the Corvin Passage==
{{further|The Battle of the Corvin Passage}}
[[File:Hole in flag - Budapest 1956.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The Corvin Köz in 1956|The Corvin Passage in 1956]]
Armed civilians in the Corvin Cinema (the three floor circular structure on the right of the picture) and surrounding buildings began to fight with the Soviet armoured forces as early as the night of 23–4 October. Taking advantage of the area’s excellent strategic conditions, the rebels of the Corvin Passage (''Corvin Köz'') soon became the Uprising's biggest and most important armed revolutionary group. Their valour was a decisive factor behind the favourable turn of events on 28 October.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The Corvin fighters were initially led by [[László Iván Kovács]], with the young and charismatic Pongrátz taking command on 1 November. (24 at the time of the conflict he was nicknamed ''Bajusz,'' meaning "moustache.")  Representatives of the Corvin Passage group negotiated several times with national political and military leaders during the ceasefire, and their influence on armed groups in their neighbourhood steadily increased.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

The Red Army began to attack the group in considerable strength on the evening of November 4. However, the defenders managed to hold their positions until the following afternoon, when the Soviets followed up an artillery bombardment with a further strong attack. The surrounding buildings were seriously damaged and the cinema itself caught fire.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Though they had destroyed at least a dozen Soviet Tanks, with little more than [[Molotov cocktails]], the overwhelming force of the assault caused the group to abandon its base. Nevertheless, members of Pongrátz's Corvin Passage fighters continued their resistance as [[guerrilla]]s in other parts of the city for several days. While others retreated into the cellars of the buildings until they were crushed by their enemy's superior numbers; the Communist forces having poured 31,550 troops and 1,130 tanks into Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;Sources vary widely on numbers of Soviet forces involved in the intervention. The UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary'' (1957) estimated 75,000-200,000 troops and 1,600-4,000 tanks [http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf] (p. 56, para. 183), but recently released Soviet archives (available in [[Lib.ru]], Maksim Moshkow's Library) list the troop strength of the Soviet forces as 31,550, with 1,130 tanks and [[self-propelled artillery]] pieces.{{cite web |url=http://fan.lib.ru/c/chekmarew_w_a/text_0200.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209184727/http://fan.lib.ru/c/chekmarew_w_a/text_0200.shtml |archivedate=2010-02-09 |df= }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Following his return from exile in 1991, and in addition to his becoming president of the [[World Federation of Hungarians]] (''Magyarok Világszövetsége''), Pongrátz was a frequent and vocal critic of the successive [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Hungarian Socialist]] governments that came to power after the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]]. Despite the [[Revolutions of 1989|events of 1989]]
Pongrátz witnessed the democratic successor organization&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Korosenyi | first = Andras | title = Government and Politics in Hungary | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GXpRQNITwV0C&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=The+successor+to+the+Communist+Party,+the+MSZP,+is+a+%27cadre%27+party&amp;q= | publisher = Central European University Press | year = 2000 | page = 64 | isbn = 963-9116-76-9 | quote = &lt;small&gt;The successor to the Communist Party, the MSZP, is a 'cadre' party—it remains the party of the political class of the former system.

Depressed by what he saw as the continued presence and pervasive influence of former [[Hungarian Socialist Workers Party|Hungarian Communists]] in the senior posts of government, commerce and public life;&lt;ref&gt;[http://belfold.ma.hu/tart/rcikk/a/0/102917/1 Pongrácz: Átvészeltük Horn Gyulát is, Medgyessyt is, és én tudom, hogy Gyurcsányt is átvészeljük majd], accessed on 9 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; he became a leading figure in a new Hungarian [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movement, eventually founding a right-wing political party, the [[Jobbik|Movement for a Better Hungary]] (''Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom''), today third largest party in Hungary.

==Museum==
Pongrátz first founded a museum of the 1956 revolution in 1991.  It was closed in 1995 after the local authorities wished to use the building for a different purpose.  Pongrátz then purchased and renovated an old school building in [[Kiskunmajsa]] and turned it into the only museum of the 1956 Revolution that exists in Hungary.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

==Death==
Gergely Pongrátz died in the grounds of his museum, after suffering a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Several high-ranking state officials, including the President of the [[Republic of Hungary]], were present at his funeral. He died a year short of the [[2006 protests in Hungary#Monday.2C October 23.2C 2006|50th anniversary]] of those few weeks in 1956 that had dominated the whole of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Gergely Pongrátz: Resistance fighter in the Hungarian Uprising | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article526081.ece | publisher = [[The Times]] (Obituaries) | date = 2005-05-25 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Lenovac]], near [[Zaječar]],&lt;ref name=Vojska/&gt; in the [[Crna Reka (Trgovište)|Crna Reka]] [[Nahiye (Ottoman)|nahija]], into the family of Petar (hence he took ''[[Petrović]]'' as his surname) and Petrinja.&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-735&gt;Nenadović 1884, p. 735&lt;/ref&gt; He had two younger brothers, [[Milutin Petrović|Milutin]] and Miljko.&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-735/&gt; His father was called ''Sirenjar Petar'' ("Peter the Cheese Maker") due to his multitude of [[livestock]] which he possessed, and the amount of cheese he sold.&lt;ref name=Nikolic56&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EdPfZd51GmUC Nikolić 1898, p. 56]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-736&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=N1ILAAAAIAAJ Nenadović 1884, p. 736]&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a very calm person, though Veljko was an unruly kid.&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-736/&gt; In his youth he kept cattle,&lt;ref name=Nikolic56/&gt; even becoming ''čobanbaša'' ("head herder") among the local herders.&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-736/&gt; The local Turks often visited their house, eating their food, drinking and taking cheese, butter oil, and milk.&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-736/&gt;

[[Osman Pazvantoğlu]]'s ''krdžalije'' (Ottoman [[brigands]]), who were deemed rebels by the Sultan, had fought the Imperial troops at Crna Reka, and then continued to attack local Turks loyal to the Sultan, and burned and devastated several villages in the region, including Lenovac.&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-736/&gt; This prompted Veljko, only 15 years old, to leave his parents and brothers for [[Vidin]].&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-736/&gt; There he was hired as a shepherd by a Turk, and after some time he left for [[Požarevac]], where he was hired by the Vojvoda of Požarevac to prepare food.&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-736/&gt; As he had also spent some time there, at [[Easter]] time, he danced the ''[[Kolo (dance)|kolo]]'' with his friends, forgetting to prepare the important dinner for his master.&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-736/&gt; For this, his master chased to beat him, thus Veljko fled, ending up in the ''[[hajduk]]'' (Serbian brigands) bands of [[Stanoje Glavaš]].&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-736/&gt; In the winter time of 1803, Glavaš had arranged for Veljko to stay at the house of a ''jatak'' ("concealer", civil hajduk supporter) in [[Dubona]], in the [[Smederevo]] nahija, where he would work as a shepherd.&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-736/&gt; In the same village Veljko met Marija, a widow and relative of Glavaš, and married her, moving to her house.&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-736/&gt; Not long after the wedding, the [[Slaughter of the Knezes]] took place (January 1804), in which prominent Serb leaders were executed by the [[Janissary]] [[military junta]] of the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]]&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-736/&gt; (these janissaries, under the leadership of [[Kučuk Alija]], had murdered ''sanjak-bey'' [[Hadži Mustafa Pasha]] on 15 December 1801 and taken the rule of the sanjak). As a response to the executions, the Serbian population, without a central figure, took measures of self-defence, and spontaneously attacked the jannisaries.&lt;ref&gt;Jelavich, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Serbian Uprising===

Hearing of [[Karađorđe]]'s activities, Veljko immediately asked his wife for hajduk wear and weapons, and joined Glavaš' bands.&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-736/&gt; When Karađorđe arrived at [[Orašac (Aranđelovac)|Orašac]] on the [[Meeting of the Lord]], February 2, 1804, and was chosen by the people, Glavaš, [[Janko Katić|Katić]], [[Vasa Čarapić|Čarapić]], Jakovljević, Vule, and others, to be the "Supreme Leader of the Serb People", Veljko was present in Glavaš' ''[[četa]]'' (band of fighters).&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-736/&gt; As the Uprising developed, Glavaš lay away his weapon, and Veljko then served the Smederevo Vojvoda [[Dušan Vulićević]] (known as "Đuša") fighting the Ottomans.&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-736/&gt; In the fall of 1805, Vojvoda Đuša was killed by the Turks in Smederevo.&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-736/&gt; Karađorđe put Đuša's younger brother [[Vujica Vulićević]] in his place.&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-736/&gt; Veljko became one of Vujica's ''buljukbašica'' (a commander of a few men).&lt;ref name=Nenadovic-737&gt;Nenadovic, p. 737&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Dušan Vulićević]] he fought to free Beograd (1806), where he excelled in combat. In 1807 he became a ''buljubaša / буљубаша'' and is granted permission from the Council to incite rebellion in the areas of Krivi Vir and Crna Reka. In 1809, he, despite being heavily outnumbered, bravely defended [[Soko Banja]] from the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. His personal bravery was extraordinary and won him extraordinary praise and fame throughout [[Serbia]] and the [[Balkans]]. In 1810 he was decorated with Russian Golden Cross for his bravery.

He was noted in the battle of [[Varvarin]], where he was wounded in his left arm and became slightly crippled. In 1811 he became ''[[Voivoda]] of the Timocka Krajina'' and he was sent to Negotin, in Timocka Krajina In 1813, a detachment of Turkish cavalry attacked him at village of Bukovče where Veljko destroyed them. Turks then set forth with much stronger force, so Veljko retreated to Negotin to defend it.

Large battles took place around Negotin in the summer of 1813. The Turks began to lay siege to Negotin with reinforcements from Vlaška ([[Walachia]]). In total, 16,000 Turkish soldiers attacked Negotin, which was defended by 3,000 Serbian soldiers. Veljko fortified Negotin, built a moat and towers, and waited for the Turks. The tallest tower in which Veljko resided, was named Baba Finka. In the moats, together with Veljko were his brothers Milutin and Miljko. Also, there were the prominent buljubaše and Dimbaše Hadži-Nikola, Abrašelibalta among many others. The expected aid that Veljko had requested didn't arrive, and ammunition was running low, so Veljko ordered all tin objects in the city melted down for ammunition, and he ordered metal coins to be put into the cannons. One morning after twenty days of heroic defense, he ordered repair around his moat was struck by a cannonball. He died almost immediately. The [[Battle of Negotin]] ended in massive Turkish casualties and the successful escape of the [[Serbs|Serbian]] rebels. His brother Milutin buried him at sunset at Negotin's church. After Veljko's death Turks conquered Negotin and soon all Krajin . He is still remembered for his famous words: "Glavu dajem, Krajinu ne dajem". (I'll give my head, but not Krajina)

Just before the Battle of [[Negotin]], his friend, [[Vuk Karadžić]] suggested to him that he send his gold, jewels and other valuables to his family, so they wouldn't fall into Turkish hands. But Veljko refused, believing it wouldn't be proper for a great hajduk and war hero to be slain and found penniless. Veljko considered his personal reputation and glory more important than mere gold.

==Legacy==
[[File:Spomenik na mestu pogibije Hajduk Veljka.JPG|thumb|Monument on his death site.]]
As a popular hero, there existed songs about him even during his lifetime. There exist over 70 lyrical and 10 epic poems about him. Some of the most known songs or epic poems include "Raslo mi je badem drvo" (''Расло ми је бадем дрво'') and "Bolan mi leži Kara-Mustafa" (''Болан ми лежи Кара-Мустафа'').

Serbian comic author [[Živorad Atanacković]] (1933-1998) created an adventurous [[comic]] on the person of Veljko Petrović, with the theme of the First Serbian Uprising (''Hajduk Veljko'', 1966).

Some Bulgarian historians have portrayed Veljko as a Bulgarian, as part of their national aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KkrSAAAAMAAJ Review of International Affairs 1974], p. 11: {{quote|"Studies" by various Bulgarian historians have also been known to reveal aspirations towards parts of the Socialist Republic of Serbia and parts of Northern Greece. Famous Serbian rebel leader Hajduk Veljko is portrayed as a Bulgarian insurgent, the Skull Tower (Cele kula) in Ni5 is presented as a Bulgarian cultural monument, etc..}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Georges Castellan]] his mother was ethnic Bulgarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Castellan |first=Georges |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=History of the Balkans 14th-15th Century |year=1999 |publisher=Hermes |location=Plovdiv |isbn=954-459-901-0 |language=Bulgarian |page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote needed|date=May 2013}}

He is included in [[The 100 most prominent Serbs]].

'''Henry Newton Brown''' (1857 – April 30, 1884) was an [[American Old West]] gunman who played the roles of both lawman and [[outlaw]] during his life.

Brown was raised in Cold Springs Township, in [[Phelps County, Missouri|Phelps County]], ten miles south of [[Rolla, Missouri|Rolla]], [[Missouri]]. An [[orphan]], he lived there with his uncle Jasper and aunt Aldamira Richardson until the age of seventeen, when he left home and headed [[American Old West|west]].  He drifted through various [[cowboy]] jobs in [[Colorado]] and [[Texas]], supposedly killing a man in a gunfight in the [[Texas]] [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]].

==Lincoln County War==
In 1877, Brown landed in the [[New Mexico Territory]], and became embroiled in the [[Lincoln County War]], a battle of wills for economic domination of the region between two opposing factions. The first was the association of Attorney [[Alexander McSween]] and [[John Henry Tunstall]], sometimes noted as "the good guys."  They had the support of cattle baron [[John Chisum]] and a company of young working cowboys that were to become proficient gunmen known as "The [[Lincoln County Regulators|Regulators]]."  Brown joined [[Billy the Kid]] and others of this group as a cowboy working on Tunstall's Rio Feliz Ranch.

The opposing faction, sometimes noted as the "bad guys," were known as "The House" was the partnership of Major [[Lawrence Murphy|Lawrence G. Murphy]] and [[James Dolan (Lincoln County War)|James J. Dolan]], bolstered by a powerful political machine known as the "Santa Fe Ring."   Lincoln County Sheriff [[William J. Brady|William Brady]] and his deputies, as well as a cadre of gunmen, were loyal to "The House."

On April 1, 1878, Brown, [[Billy the Kid]], [[Jim French (cowboy)|Jim French]], [[Frank McNab]], [[John Middleton (cowboy)|John Middleton]] and [[Fred Waite]] ambushed and murdered [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Lincoln County]] [[Sheriff]] [[William J. Brady|William Brady]], who was indirectly responsible for the death of the Regulators' employer, John Tunstall.  Three days later, at the famous [[Gunfight at Blazer's Mill]], Brown and the Regulators engaged in a gunfight with [[Buckshot Roberts]], another man they believed involved in Tunstall's murder.  Roberts received a serious gunshot wound from [[Charlie Bowdre]] which later proved to be fatal, but not before he managed to kill the Regulators' nominal leader, [[Richard M. Brewer]].  Retreating into proprietor Blazer's office, Roberts continued a prolonged firefight with Brown and the Regulators. He died the next day.

The [[Lincoln County Regulators]] — fugitives now for the Brady killing — spent the next several months in hiding. Then on July 15, 1878,  they became trapped, along with one of Tunstall's partners, Alexander McSween, in McSween's home in Lincoln  by members of "The House" and some of Brady's men.  Henry Brown was one of three Regulators not actually in McSween's house at the time, but instead was sniping at Brady's men from a grain warehouse behind the Tunstall store.  He escaped with [[Billy the Kid]] and the others when the siegers set fire to the house.  McSween was shot down while fleeing the blaze, and his death essentially marked the end of the Lincoln County Cattle War.

==Outlaw to Lawman==
In the fall of that year, Brown, [[Billy the Kid]], and a few of the remaining Regulators trailed a herd of rustled horses to the little town of Tascosa in the Texas Panhandle.  After the horses were sold the Regulators returned to their old haunts, but Brown, named in two murder warrants in the state of New Mexico, wisely remained in Texas where he eventually became a lawman.  It has not been established whether he was a deputy sheriff of [[Oldham County, Texas|Oldham County]], Texas; Marshal of Tascosa or a constable.  He had a quick temper and was quickly dismissed because he "was always wanting to fight and get his mane up."

Brown thereafter drifted through the ([[Oklahoma]]) [[Indian Territory]] and into [[Kansas]], working on ranches. In July, 1882, when about 25 years old, he settled in [[Caldwell, Kansas|Caldwell]], Kansas—a rough cattle town comparable to [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]] and [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]]—where he was first appointed Assistant Marshal of the city; then promoted to marshal about five months later. The [[Chisholm Trail]] met the [[Santa Fe Railroad|Santa Fe]] tracks in Caldwell and as the terminus of the trail, it had a long history of violence. Brown, an outlaw turned lawman, and Ben Wheeler, who had been a former Texas lawman turned outlaw, joined forces (with Wheeler as Assistant Marshal) and effectively cleaned up the town.

Brown was described by contemporaries as a "very much undersize" man who didn't smoke, drink, chew, or gamble, and was noted to be in regular attendance at the Methodist Church. Said to be "exceedingly modest and, in fact, bashful," he displayed an introvert presence but "gained the entire confidence of the people . . . and . . . conducted himself in such a manner that the doors of society were always open to him."

But, "he had a square set jaw, not unlike that of a bull dog" and "his face indicated firmness and a lack of physical fear."  "His words were few and parted with reluctantly," and when duty called, Brown's demeanor changed immediately. He was easily angered: his temper flared instantly and his outwardly meek manner transformed into one of deadly grave purpose.  One contemporary commented that "he was a two-gun man.  He could take a six-shooter in each hand and make one think a battle was on."

From the grateful community, in appreciation for his service, he was given an extensively engraved, gold and silver mounted Winchester rifle. A silver medallion was affixed to the stock inscribed: 
"Presented to City Marshal
H. N. Brown
For valuable services rendered 
In behalf of the Citizens of
Caldwell Kas   
A. N. Colson  Mayor  Dec 1882"

Brown killed a gambler, Newt Boyce, with the rifle (in the line of duty) on December 16, 1883.  Another killing attributed to Brown in Caldwell was that of Spotted Horse, a renegade Indian.

Henry Brown gained status in the higher realms of Caldwell society when he married Alice Maude Levagood, the daughter of a well-to-do Caldwell brick maker.  Alice had a college degree―rare for females of that era.

Marshal Brown and his assistant kept the town clean, and by the time they were appointed to their third term, they were lauded by the citizens as the best and most effective team of lawmen the town had ever had.

==The Medicine Valley Bank Robbery==
In April, 1884, Brown and Wheeler concocted a story convincing the mayor to give them leave to travel into the [[Indian Territory]] to hunt a murderer. With two [[Cherokee Outlet]] cowboys, William Smith and John Wesley, they rode to [[Medicine Lodge, Kansas|Medicine Lodge]], [[Kansas]], and attempted to rob the Medicine Valley Bank. Almost immediately, their attempt fell apart in disaster when gunfire erupted and two of the bank officers were shot.  Most conventional accounts name Brown as bank president Wylie Payne's murderer. But T. A. McNeal, author of ''When Kansas Was Young'', sat at his friend Payne's bedside as he lay dying and reports that Payne named Wesley as his killer.  Wheeler (and possibly, Wesley) shot George Geppert, the bank's chief cashier who, just before he died, sealed the vault, preventing the robbers from escaping with any money.

Brown and the outlaws fled under fire, pursued by a posse composed of 12 cowboys that happened to be in a stable directly across the street from the bank. The four fugitives, closely pursued by the posse, unwittingly rode into a box canyon several miles south of the town and were eventually forced to surrender. 

Later, incarcerated in the town's small jail, they anticipated a [[Lynching|lynch mob]], and were offered the opportunity to write letters to their loved ones.  Brown did write a poignant letter to his wife.  It read in part:
"Darling Wife: I am in jail here. Four of us tried to rob the bank here and one man shot one of the men in the bank. I want you to come and see me as soon as you can. I will send you all of my things and you can sell them. But keep the Winchester. It is hard for me to write this letter, but it was all for you, my sweet wife, and for the love I have for you.  "Do not go back on me. If you do it will kill me. Be true to me as long as you live, and come to see me if you think enough of me. My love is just the same as it always was. Oh, how I did hate to leave you last Sunday evening. But I did not think this would happen. I thought we could take in the money and not have any trouble with it, but a man's fondest hopes are sometimes broken with trouble. We would not have been arrested but one of our horses gave out and we could not leave him [the rider] alone. I do not know what to write. Do the best you can with everything. I want you to send me some clothes. Sell all the things you don't need. Have your picture taken and send it to me. Now, my dear wife, go and see Mr. Witzleben and Mr. Nyce and get the money. If a mob does not kill us we will come out all right after while. Maude, I did not shoot anyone and didn't want the others to kill anyone. But they did and that is all there is about it. Now, my darling wife, goodbye. H. N. Brown."

==Death==

Realizing that a lynching was imminent, Wesley removed his boot and with it, the shackle of the leg-iron with which he had been shackled to Brown.  Brown tied the loose end of the leg-iron to his leg with his bandana allowing him to run unencumbered.  Smith, handcuffed to Wheeler, was able to slip the handcuff over his small hand resulting, unknown to the gathering mob, in all four being free. When the lynch mob came at 9 pm and opened the door, Brown burst through the startled lynch mob to an alley alongside the jail.  As he ran past, he was blasted with both barrels of a shotgun at almost point blank range. He died being nearly torn in half. Wheeler ran about 100 yards before being horribly wounded in a barrage of gunfire but lived long enough to hang with Smith and Wesley shortly afterward when the three were hanged on an elm tree by the mob.

==Other media==
In the film ''[[Young Guns II]]'' Henry Brown was combined with fellow Regulator [[Jim French (cowboy)|Jim French]] and presented as a composite named Hendry William French. Timid and clumsy, the film's portrayal of French by actor [[Alan Ruck]] bears little actual resemblance to either outlaw.

The actor [[William Smith (actor)|William Smith]] played Brown in the 1969 episode "The Restless Man" of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]] ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]]. In the story line, Brown takes the job of sheriff to tame a lawless town, begins to court a young woman, but returns to his deadly outlaw ways in search of thrills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/death-valley-days/a-restless-man-194093/|title=A Restless Man on ''Death Valley Days''|publisher=tv.com|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Player profile==
Se is a tough, physical, and aggressive player who never backs down. He is known for collecting excessive technical fouls due to his rough playing style.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} In 2008, he was ejected from a match with the [[Singapore Slingers]] for kicking opposing player [[Eric Sandrin]] in the head in response to Sandrin's [[trash-talk]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://redsports.sg/2008/09/23/sandrin-ocampo-basketball/|first=Les|last=Tan|title=Slinger Eric Sandrin survives dangerous play by de Ocampo of Air21|work=Red Sports|date=2008-09-23|accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6-6 former stalwart of San Sebastian College - Recoletos failed to continue the Stags’ reign in the NCAA after his team lost to the Letran Knights.

He then join the [[Metropolitan Basketball Association]], but the league was on its last remaining years before closing down permanently. After his short stint in the MBA, he then went to the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] and was picked by [[Barako Bull Energy Boosters (2000-2011)|Red Bull]] as the 5th overall in 2002. He won a championship with Red Bull after being traded to [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21]].

He was then traded to Ginebra alongside [[Cyrus Baguio]] in exchange for 2012 and 2013 future picks. At the end of the [[2009 PBA Fiesta Conference]], he was waived by the Gin Kings.

Se played for the [[Shopinas.com Clickers]] in an attempt to return to the PBA, but due to an injury, he had to retire once more.

'''Humphrey Bromley''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1796–1826) was a Welsh [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] preacher. He may have been the first Unitarian preacher in North Wales. His parents were Humphrey and Jane Bromley, of Tre-brys, Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, [[Denbighshire]]. He (like his father) worked as a gardener, but he also ran a school in the Pont Maes Mochnant area.

Although he was originally an [[Anglican]], he became a Unitarian preacher, being supported financially by a Mr Lloyd, a local shopkeeper. He preached at some of the meetings of the South Wales Unitarian Association which were held annually.

He later immigrated to the US. His date of death is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humphrey Bromley|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-BROM-HUM-1796.html|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Batiste "J.B." Fuselier'''&lt;ref name="savoy84p142"&gt;[[#Savoy84|Savoy 1984]], p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; (April 17, 1901 – August 13, 1975)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1970.html|title=The Dead Rock Stars Club – The 1970s|accessdate=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Cajun music]]ian most remembered for his tune "Ma Chere Bassette".&lt;ref name="broven83p54"&gt;[[#Broven83|Broven 1983]], p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; He played for many years with the group J. B. and His Merrymakers.

==Early life==
Fuselier began playing the fiddle when he was five. In a 1937 interview, he claimed that when he started violin, he was too small to pick it up to play.&lt;ref name="yule09p124"&gt;[[#Yule09|Yule 2009]], p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; He had to lie on the bed. He also started playing the accordion at a very young age. At the age of nine, he played his first dance.&lt;ref name="savoy84p142" /&gt;

==String band era==
In the 1930s, he recorded many records with [[Victor Records]] under the [[banjo]]ist Beethoven Miller's Merrymakers.&lt;ref name="broven83p54" /&gt; After Miller left the group in early 1938,&lt;ref name="Brasseaux09p153"&gt;[[#Brasseaux09|Brasseaux 2009]], p.153.&lt;/ref&gt; Fuselier changed the name to J.B. and His Merrymakers. The group was very successful, drawing large crowds at the Step Inn Club in [[Lawtell, Louisiana|Lawtell]] and Fais Do Do in [[Ville Platte, Louisiana|Ville Platte]].&lt;ref name="savoy84p142" /&gt;

==After World War II==
It was around the end of the war that he met [[Iry LeJeune]].&lt;ref name="yule09p128"&gt;[[#Yule09|Yule 2009]], p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; He began playing with Iry Lejeune and the Calcasieu Playboys after he moved to Lake Charles. They played together regularly until 1955 when Lejeune died. Fuselier was driving from the Green Wing Club in [[Eunice, Louisiana|Eunice]], when he tire puntured. While changing the tire, a car hit Fuselier's car. Fuselier suffered many injuries as well. His daughter remembers his lung was collapsed and he had many broken bones; others mention a head injury.&lt;ref name="savoy84p143"&gt;[[#Savoy84|Savoy 1984]], p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yule09p129"&gt;[[#Yule09|Yule 2009]], p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued playing with his Merrymakers which consisted of Norris Courville on drums, Desbra Fontenot on steel guitar and Preston Manuel on guitar.&lt;ref name="savoy84p143" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Fuselier played for almost his entire life, until his death in 1976. Many other musicians have covered his songs and they are now a part of standard Cajun repertoire. His three most famous songs are "Ma chère Bassette", "Jongle à Moi" and "Chère Tout-Toute".  Written for his daughter, he is the first to record "Chère Tout-Toute" which would be re-recorded by many local artists.&lt;ref name="mcneese" /&gt; He never learned to use four fingers when playing the violin. He is quoted as saying, "All that money I made, I made it with three fingers."&lt;ref name="yule09p124" /&gt; He is also credited with being the first person to incorporate the [[steel guitar]] into Cajun music by hiring Atlas Frugé to play in his band.&lt;ref name="yule09p124" /&gt;&lt;ref name="savoy84p145"&gt;[[#Savoy84|Savoy 1984]], p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenni Murray|website=BBC Radio 4|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Murray joined [[BBC Radio Bristol]] in 1973 before becoming a reporter and presenter for local news programme ''[[South Today]]''. She was a newsreader and later one of the presenters of the BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' television programme for two years from 1983 before moving to Radio 4 to present the [[Today programme|''Today'']] programme. She took over from [[Sue MacGregor]] as presenter of ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' in 1987. She has also presented Radio 4's ''The Message'' and written for magazines and newspapers including "The Guardian", ''[[Daily Express]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mail]]''.&lt;ref name=newbbcprofile/&gt;&lt;ref name=oldbbcprofile/&gt;

She has written several books, including

* 1996 – "Woman's hour", 50 years of British Women
* 2003 – That's My Boy
* 2003 – Is It Me or Is It Hot in Here: A Modern Woman's Guide to the Men'opause

==Health issues==
On 21 December 2006, Murray announced at the end of ''Woman's Hour'' that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6199625.stm|title=Radio 4's Jenni Murray has cancer|date=21 December 2006|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; She informed her audience that her prognosis was good; she did indeed return early in 2007. She reported that the most emotionally upsetting moment was losing her hair, and used this as an item on the [[Hair#Indication of status|centrality of hair to definitions of femininity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/02/2007_09_tue.shtml |title=Woman's Hour, 27 February 2007 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, she had a hip replacement following [[avascular necrosis]], perhaps due to her earlier chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1077390/No-told-breast-cancer-treatment-leave-needing-new-hips.html |title='No one told me that my breast cancer treatment would leave me needing two new hips,' says Radio 4's Jenni Murray |first=Jenni|last=Murray|newspaper=Daily Mail |date=15 October 2008  |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray had a [[sleeve gastrectomy]] in June 2015, and had lost over {{convert|4|stone|lb kg}} by October of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jenni Murray: 'I had 75% of my stomach removed|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34594956|publisher=BBC News|date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
Murray was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) for services to broadcasting in 1999 and [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (DBE) in the [[2011 Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=59808|date=11 June 2011|page=7|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Main list of the 2011 Queen's birthday honours recipients|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/11_06_11honours_mainlist.pdf|publisher=BBC News UK|accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012 she was awarded an honorary degree from the [[University of Salford]] to recognise her contributions to the media industry as well as the growing links between the University and its neighbours at [[Salford Quays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=University of Salford |url=http://www.salford.ac.uk/home-page/news/2012/mediacityuk-opening-honorary-degrees-for-womans-hour-presenter-and-director-general |publisher=University of Salford |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501131546/http://www.salford.ac.uk/home-page/news/2012/mediacityuk-opening-honorary-degrees-for-womans-hour-presenter-and-director-general |archivedate= 1 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charities==
In November 2007 it was announced that Murray had been named Patron of British medical research charity, [[Breast Cancer Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.2694 |title=Article from |publisher=radiotoday.co.uk |accessdate=23 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207000225/http://www.radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.2694 |archivedate= 7 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
She is also patron of the [[Family Planning Association]], vice-president of [[Parkinson's UK]] and a supporter of [[Humanists UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/about/our-people/distinguished-supporters/dame-jenni-murray/|title=Dame Jenni Murray|publisher=British Humanist Association|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johannes Palm''' (1713–1799), whose name is often anglicized to John Palm, is given credit for founding [[Palmyra, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=Palmyra&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Palmyra |url=http://www.palmyrapa.com/history/history-of-palmyra.html |work=PalmyraPa.com |publisher=PalmyraPa.com |accessdate=25 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525201419/http://www.palmyrapa.com/history/history-of-palmyra.html |archivedate=25 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a prominent figure in the early days of the community, who served his country as a doctor and soldier.

Johannes Palm was born in [[Heilsbronn]] to Matthias and Sibylla Palm on July 15, 1713. In 1739, Palm moved to [[Backnang]], near [[Stuttgart]].  He married Christina Dorothea Kern on August 2, 1740.  After a visit to [[Amsterdam]], Palm began to study medicine in [[Württemberg]].  He was most likely aided by relatives, as many physicians and druggists in Württemberg at that time held the Palm family name.  Palm left Germany, and arrived in [[Philadelphia]] in 1749.  He first settled in Northern [[New Jersey]], near [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]].  After the death of his wife, he married Catharine Salome Fenger around 1754. He would outlive her as well.
  
On June 17, 1766, Palm secured his {{convert|100|acre|km2|sing=on}} plot from Conrad Raisch.  Palm was the third owner of the tract since it was surveyed for Johannes Deininger in 1751. This tract can be located today using Railroad St. as the eastern border, Maple St. as the southern border, and the [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin County]] Line as the western border.  His house would be in the center of the 100 block on W. Main St.

By the time the [[American Revolution]] broke out in 1775, Palm was 62. Although he felt was too old to take an active part in the revolution, he did participate in the [[Battle of Brandywine]] on September 11, 1777. He would later recall how [[George Washington]] would encourage his men in battle. Sixteen days after he served at Brandywine, Palm took the [[Oath of Citizenship|Oath of Allegiance and Fidelity]] before [[Justice of the Peace]] John Thomas. Ten other soldiers from the Palmyra area also served in the American Revolution. Their names are recorded and their graves are marked in Bindnagles Cemetery.

Palm had an extensive medical practice. Since the region was still sparsely populated, many of his patients traveled great distances to receive his attention. He had a sophisticated laboratory where he prepared most of his medicines. He distilled his own essential oils and waters from herbs, flowers and other plants. His medical books were mostly from German authors. Palm was baptized and confirmed into the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]].

Johannes Palm died on April 25, 1799, in Palmyra, at the age of 85. He had practiced medicine in North America for nearly 50 years.

On July 24, 1932, American Legion Post No. 72, with the assistance of S. M. Aument of [[Montoursville, Pennsylvania|Montoursville]], a great-great-great-great granddaughter of Johannes Palm, unveiled a new marker at Palm’s grave at Bindnagle Cemetery, located at Bindnagle Lutheran Church, 801 Gravel Hill Road.  On November 20 of that same year, the John Palm Memorial was erected on a small triangle of land on Railroad St. On hand was Dr. Howard Palm of [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], who was also a direct descendant of Johannes Palm.

'''Joël Stephanus Voordewind''' (born 9 July 1965 in [[Sleen]], [[Drenthe]]) is a Dutch politician and former [[development aid]] worker. As a member of the [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]] (''ChristenUnie'') he has been an MP since 30 November 2006. He focuses on matters of [[foreign policy]], [[defense (military)|defense]], [[development aid]], [[youth]] and family.

== Biography ==
Voordewind, after receiving a degree in [[political sciences]] (with a specialization in [[international relations]]) at [[VU University Amsterdam]], started working as an assistant for the Dutch [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour]] parliamentary party. He began in 1991 and left the party in 1994. After this he worked for the [[European Union]], the [[United Nations]] and an international Christian aid organisation named [[Dorcas Aid]]. For some time he was committed as a spokesman to the Dutch Secretary of Defence.

After some time Voordewind came to the conclusion that because of his Christian convictions, it would be better if he switched to a Christian party. He made this decision in 1999 and began to work for the [[parliamentary group]] of the Christian Union. In 2001 he became their campaign leader for the [[Dutch general election, 2002|Dutch general election in 2002]]. He also led the campaign towards the [[Dutch general election, 2003|general election in 2003]]. In 2003 he was a member of the [[States-Provincial]] of [[North Holland]]. Until 2006 he was head of the [[public relations]] division of the party. He was chairman of the local Christian Union in the Dutch capital [[Amsterdam]] for which in 2002 and 2006 he stood for the local council, but both times the CU gained no seats.

Voordewind was elected into the Dutch Parliament in 2006. He was the fourth name on the candidate list of the Christian Union, which doubled its number of seats from three to six. For this party he is the spokesman for all issues concerning the health system, welfare and sports, defence and European Affairs.

He is married and the father of two children. He lives in Amsterdam and is a member of a Dutch [[Association of Vineyard Churches|Vineyard-church]].

[[File:SekienKodama.jpg|thumb|right|300px|"Kodama" ({{lang|ja|木魅}}) from the [[Gazu Hyakki Yagyō]] by [[Toriyama Sekien]].]]
'''Kodama''' ({{lang|ja|木霊}}, {{lang|ja|木魂}} or {{lang|ja|木魅}}) are spirit in [[Japanese folklore]] that inhabit [[tree]]s, similar to the [[dryad]]s of [[Greek mythology]]. The term is also used to denote a tree in which a kodama supposedly resides. The phenomenon known as [[yamabiko (folklore)|yamabiko]], when sounds make a delayed echoing effect in mountains and valleys, is sometimes attributed to this kind of spirit, and may also be referred to as "kodama".

==Summary==
These spirits are considered to nimbly bustle about mountains at will. A kodama's outer appearance is very much like an ordinary tree, but if one attempts to cut it down, one would become cursed etc., and it is thus considered to have some kind of mysterious supernatural power. The knowledge of those trees that have kodama living in them is passed down by the elderly of that area over successive generations and they are protected, and it is also said that trees that have a kodama living in them are of certain species. There is also a theory that when old trees are cut, blood could come forth from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=草野巧|title=幻想動物事典|year=1997|publisher=新紀元社|isbn=978-4-88317-283-2|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kodama is also seen as something that can be understood as [[Yama-no-Kami|mountain gods]], and a tree god from the old [[Kojiki]], Kukunochi no Kami, has been interpreted as a kodama, and in the [[Heian period]] dictionary, the [[Wamyō Ruijushō]], there is a statement on tree gods under the Japanese name "Kodama" (古多万). In [[The Tale of Genji]], there are statements such as "is it an oni, a god (kami), a fox (kitsune), or a tree spirit (kodama)" and "the oni of a kodama," and thus, it can be seen that kodama are seen to be close to [[yōkai]].&lt;ref name="kaidanshu"&gt;{{Cite book|author=今野円輔編著|title=日本怪談集 妖怪篇|year=1981|publisher=社会思想社|series=現代教養文庫|isbn=978-4-390-11055-6|pages=290–303}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are said to take on the appearance of atmospheric ghost lights, of beasts, and of humans, and there is also a story where a kodama who, in order to meet a human it fell in love with, took on the appearance of a human itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=多田克己|title=幻想世界の住人たち|volume=IV|year=1990|publisher=新紀元社|series=[[Truth In Fantasy]]|isbn=978-4-915146-44-2|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Aogashima]] in the [[Izu Islands]], shrines are created at the base of large [[Cryptomeria|sugi]] trees in the mountains and are worshipped to under the name "kidama-sama" and "kodama-sama," and thus the vestiges of belief in tree spirits can be seen.&lt;ref name="kaidanshu" /&gt; Also, in the village of Mitsune on [[Hachijō-jima]], whenever a tree is cut, there was a tradition that one must offer a festival to the tree's spirit "kidama-sama."&lt;ref name="goi"&gt;{{Cite book|author=萩原龍夫|editor=民俗学研究所編|others=柳田國男監修|title=綜合日本民俗語彙|edition=改訂版|origyear=1955|year=1977|publisher=平凡社|volume=第1巻|isbn=978-4-582-11400-3|page=457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Okinawa]], tree spirits are called "kiinushii," and whenever a tree is cut down, one would first pray to kiinushii and then cut it. Also, when there is an echoing noise of what sounds like a fallen tree at the dead of night, even though there are no actual fallen trees, it is said to be the anguishing voice of kiinushii, and it is said that in times like these, the tree would then wither several days later. The [[kijimuna]], which is known as a yōkai on Okinawa, is also sometimes said to be a type of kiinushii, or a personification of a kiinushii.&lt;ref name="kaidanshu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=村上健司編著|title=日本妖怪大事典|year=2005|publisher=角川書店|series=Kwai books|isbn=978-4-04-883926-6|pages=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the collection of yōkai depictions, the ''[[Gazu Hyakki Yagyō]]'' by [[Toriyama Sekien]], under the title 木魅 ("kodama"), an aged man and woman are depicted standing alongside the trees, and here it is stated that when a tree has passed a hundred years of age, a divine spirit would come dwell inside it, and show its appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=稲田篤信・田中直日編|others=高田衛監修|title=鳥山石燕 画図百鬼夜行|year=1992|publisher=国書刊行会|isbn=978-4-336-03386-4|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 13th century [[Shinto|Ryōbu Shinto]] manual ''Reikiki'', kodama can be found in groups in the inner reaches of mountains. They occasionally speak, and can especially be heard when a person dies.&lt;ref&gt;叶精二 "[http://ghibli-fc.net/rabo/monoke_yo/yomitoku30.html 「もののけ姫」を読み解く] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724002340/http://ghibli-fc.net/rabo/monoke_yo/yomitoku30.html |date=2012-07-24 }}" Tokyo: Comic Box, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, cutting down a tree which houses a kodama is thought to bring misfortune, and such trees are often marked with ''[[shimenawa]]'' rope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mizuki | first = Shigeru | authorlink = Mizuki Shigeru | title = Mujara 1: Kantō, Hokkaidō, Okinawa-hen | year = 2003 | publisher = Soft Garage | location = Japan | language = Japanese | isbn = 978-4-86133-004-9 | page = 51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This page details the career achievements of [[United States|American]] [[track &amp; field]] athlete '''[[Michael Johnson (sprinter)|Michael Johnson]]'''.  Over the course of his career, Johnson consistently dominated his events, winning almost every time he took to the track.  He set numerous world and Olympic records in short distance track, both as an individual and as a member of relay teams.  His domination of the 400 meter race is unprecedented in the history of track and field, making him arguably the greatest 400 m runner of all time.  For approximately one decade, Michael Johnson held the world records in the 200 meters, 400 meters and indoor 400 meters, as well as the world's best time in the 300 meters and the world record for the 4 by 400 meter relay.  He is still a world record holder for the 4 x 400 meter relay.  In 2004, Johnson was voted into the United States Track &amp; Field Hall of Fame.  At the ceremony, his record-setting 200-meter performance at the 1996 Summer Olympics was deemed the greatest track and field moment in the past 25 years.  Johnson is generally considered one of the greatest and most consistent sprinters in the history of [[track and field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/jo/michael-johnson-2.html |title=Michael Johnson Biography and Olympic Results &amp;#124; Olympics at |publisher=Sports-reference.com |date=13 September 1967 |accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp;Michael Johnson |url=http://www.baylorbears.com/sports/c-track/mtt/johnson_michael00.html |title=Player Bio: Michael Johnson – Baylor Bears Official Athletic Site |publisher=BaylorBears.com |date= |accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FC 01 Bamberg]] in the top-tier level German [[Basketball Bundesliga]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbeyersdorf.de/archiv/saison/saison77.htm Bamberg Season 1976/77] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbeyersdorf.de/archiv/saison/saison78.htm Bamberg Season 1977/78] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simonović played for the senior [[Yugoslav national basketball team]] that won the gold medal at the [[1970 FIBA World Championship]]. He was also a three time [[FIBA European Selection]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Vrnjačka Banja]] to parents Jevrem Simonović and Ilonka Dobai, both of whom worked as hairdressers, young Ljubodrag grew up in [[Kraljevo]] with an older brother Vladimir. Their father Jevrem, a [[Serbs of Montenegro|Montenegrin Serb]] born 1911 in [[Kolašin]] whose mother died while giving birth to him and whose father died right after World War I, made a living as a [[tradesman]] (in addition to hairdressing he also worked as a [[seamster]] and [[tailor]]) and over time developed a staunchly communist worldview.&lt;ref name="radioBGD-mart-2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nešić|first=Miroslav|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/radio/sr/story/23/Radio+Beograd+1/863940/Sportski+spomenar.html|title=''Sportski spomenar'': Duci Simonović|agency=[[Radio Belgrade]]|date=27 March 2011|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simonović's mother Ilonka, born in 1921, came from a mixed background, born to [[Germans|German]] mother Ana Schumetz and [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] father János Dobay, a left-leaning officer who participated in the ultimately unsuccessful [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|1919 Hungarian Revolution]] before fleeing over the border into the recently established [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] to escape the [[White Terror (Hungary)|White Terror]] of [[Miklós Horthy]]. János initially settled in [[Subotica]] and eventually in Kraljevo where he worked as a [[machinist]]. Duci's mother Ilonka later converted to [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] and took the name Jelena.&lt;ref name="radioBGD-mart-2011"/&gt;

As a kid, Simonović took up [[chess]], which he was taught at age five by his father, an avid player himself.&lt;ref name="yugopapir.blogspot.ca"&gt;[http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2013/05/ljubodrag-duci-simonovic-o-svemu-i.html Ljubodrag Duci Simonović: O svemu i svačemu – samo ne o košarci!];''[[Tempo (Serbia magazine)|Tempo]]'', 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Simonović played the game frequently, later citing it as the first arena in which his competitive nature had been displayed.&lt;ref name="yugopapir.blogspot.ca"/&gt; He also loved playing football. As a freshman at the [[University of Belgrade]], Duci took part in the [[1968 student demonstrations in Yugoslavia|1968 student protests]].

He got the nickname Duci after the Hungarian word ''böci''.&lt;ref name="Urban Book Circle bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanbookcircle.com/ljubodrag-ldquoducirdquo-simonovic.html |author=Urban Book Circle |title=Ljubodrag "Duci" Simonovic, PhD (biography) |accessdate=2017-10-18 |date=2016-07-15 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club basketball career==
Simonović started out with [[KK Sloga]] from [[Kraljevo]].

===Red Star Belgrade===
Simonović moved to Belgrade in 1967 at the age of 18 in order to play for [[KK Crvena zvezda]] as the latest addition to a talented squad led by 26-year-old [[Vladimir Cvetković]] with a slew of up-and-coming youngsters such as 19-year-old small forward [[Dragan Kapičić]] and 18-year-old mercurial point guard [[Zoran Slavnić]]. Having graduated from the {{Interlanguage link multi|XI Belgrade Gymnasium|sr|3=Једанаеста београдска гимназија|lt=XI Belgrade Gymnasium}} and simultaneous to his duties at the club, Simonović enrolled at the [[University of Belgrade]]'s [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]], attending lectures and studying for exams.

====1968–69 season====
Coached by [[Milan Bjegojević]], Zvezda, somewhat improbably, won the [[1968–69 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1968–69 Yugoslav League]] title in Duci's third season at the club.

====1969–70 season====
Winning the Yugoslav league title meant an automatic qualification to the European Champions Cup for the following [[1969–70 FIBA European Champions Cup|1969–70 season]]. Starting off well against lesser opposition in the early rounds, Zvezda eventually got into a difficult quarterfinals group, losing all three of its home-and-away ties against [[Alexander Gomelsky]]'s defending European champion [[PBC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]], [[Aca Nikolić]]'s [[Pallacanestro Varese|Varese]], and even the seeming minnows of the group [[ASVEL Basket|ASVEL]].

On the [[1969–70 Yugoslav First Basketball League|domestic front]], the club surrendered its title, finishing second to Olimpija as Simonović recorded another stellar season that recommended him for national head coach [[Ranko Žeravica]]'s Yugoslav national squad at the [[1970 FIBA World Championship]].

====1970–71 season====
Coming off the greatest success of his career, being part of the squad that won the 1970 World Championship, Simonović continued developing his game as Zvezda went through a head coaching change with [[Đorđe Andrijašević]] being brought in as replacement to the longtime head coach Bjegojević. Andrijašević wouldn't end up sticking around for long, victim of Zvezda's another indifferent [[1970–71 Yugoslav First Basketball League|season]] in the Yugoslav League despite winning the [[Yugoslav Basketball Cup|Yugoslav Cup]].

In 1971, Simonović graduated from the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Law.

====1971–72 season====
[[Bata Đorđević]] became the new head coach, infusing new energy into the team by introducing new players Goran Rakočević and Dragiša Vučinić as Zvezda began piling up wins, both in the [[1971–72 Yugoslav First Basketball League|Yugoslav League]] and in [[1971–72 FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]]. Simonović, who turned 23 years of age midway through the season, became the team's number one option on offense, putting up tremendous scoring numbers.&lt;ref name="Stankovic"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stanković|first=Vladimir|url=http://kosmagazin.com/istorija-duci-simonovic-buntovnik-s-razlogom/|title=ISTORIJA: DUCI SIMONOVIĆ, BUNTOVNIK S RAZLOGOM|agency=''Koš magazin'' blog|date=29 August 2016|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his many stellar displays throughout the season, one stood out — playing away at [[Hala sportova]] against the eternal crosstown rivals [[KK Partizan]] he scored 59 points.&lt;ref name="Stankovic"/&gt; Making this feat even more impressive is the fact that the three-point shot hadn't been implemented yet.&lt;ref name="Stankovic"/&gt;

The season ended dramatically, as Zvezda lost the Cup Winners' Cup final in [[Thessaloniki]] 70–74 versus [[Pallacanestro Olimpia Milano|Olimpia Milano]] in late March 1972 before finishing the domestic league with the identical 17–5 record as KK Split (Jugoplastika), which meant playing a single-game playoff decider for the title. Zvezda won 75–50 thus claiming its second title in three years.

====1972–73 season====
By the summer of 1972, the Slavnić-Simonović-Kapičić trio had finally seemingly matured and big things were expected in the upcoming season.

Despite Simonović having an incident-filled summer with the national team at the 1972 Olympics, he was initially able to put it behind him and contribute greatly to Zvezda's [[1972–73 FIBA European Champions Cup|European Cup]] run. However, all was not well inside the Zvezda locker room as a simmering rift between local Belgrade-born-and-raised players who came up through the club's youth system (Slavnić and Kapičić) and those brought in from the outside (Simonović and Vučinić) had been gaining in intensity.

Cliques were being formed within the squad and things eventually boiled over on 10 January 1973 in [[Tel Aviv]] during the away contest versus Maccabi, the first game of the quarterfinals group stage. Zvezda had been leading throughout the game with Duci pouring in baskets from all positions, however, he was not satisfied with the frequency and the quality of passes he's being fed by point guard Slavnić. Slavnić in turn didn't like Simonović's attitude so he decided to stop distributing the ball to him entirely. It wasn't long before Simonović threw a fit, cursing out coach Đorđević right on the floor for not reacting to what's going on, as everything fell apart — despite Simonović scoring 38 points, Zvezda still ended up losing 113–102. Upon returning to Belgrade, Simonović got fined [[Yugoslav dinar|YUD]]300,000 by Zvezda for "excessive individualism" and "inappropriate behaviour". Deeply dissatisfied over what had transpired and extremely stung by the fine, right after playing a [[1972–73 Yugoslav First Basketball League|Yugoslav League]] game versus KK Željezničar Karlovac,&lt;ref name="rtvrevija-mart-1973"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tešić|first=Dragan|url=http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2014/03/ljubodrag-duci-simonovic-1-deo.html|title=Šta se, u stvari, dogodilo|agency=''RTV Revija''|date=9 March 1973|accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simonović announced a decision to stop playing basketball, saying he'd like to devote his time and efforts to science, having already been pursuing a master's degree in law after earning an undergraduate law degree two years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[https://exyukosarka.wordpress.com/2015/02/06/nesklad-mentaliteta-i-nedostatak-autoriteta/ Nesklad mentaliteta i nedostatak autoriteta];ex-YU košarka, 6 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Considering Simonović had just turned 24 years of age, the Yugoslav media went into overdrive, speculating on the real reasons for what it considered to be a shocking decision.&lt;ref name="rtvrevija-mart-1973"/&gt;

==National team career==
Simonović debuted for the senior [[Yugoslav national basketball team]] at age 17, going on to make 109 [[cap (sports)|appearances]] with them in total, and scoring a total of 1,018 points. His playing career ended, while he was a [[player-coach]] in Stara Pazova, due to a burst capillary in his throat.

At the [[EuroBasket]], he played in 23 games, at the [[FIBA World Cup]] he played in 6 games, and he also had 4 appearances in the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]], and 15 at the [[Balkan Games]]. All together, he won 6 gold medals and 2 silver medals. For Red Star Belgrade, he wore number 11 while for the national team, he wore number 5.

===1972 Summer Olympics===
The Yugoslav national team arrived to Munich, for the [[Basketball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Summer Olympics]], as the reigning world champions from [[1970 FIBA World Championship|Ljubljana 1970]], and still hoping to win one of the medals, though the team was quite changed. The team's victory over [[Italian national basketball team|Italy]], 85–78, at the beginning of the tournament improved their expectations, but in the second round, the Yugoslav team was defeated by [[Puerto Rico men's national basketball team|Puerto Rico]], by a score of 79–74.

It was later proven that two players from the Puerto Rican side had used illegal doping substances, prompting a protest from the Yugoslav players. Simonović however (aged 23), was ejected from the team, upon continuing to protest after the Yugoslav players had been silenced.&lt;ref name="Urban Book Circle bio"/&gt; Yugoslavia eventually finished 5th in the tournament.

==Writing==
After his retirement from sport he has written various books, including: "Rebellion of Robots", "Professionalism or Socialism", "Olympic Deception of the ‘divine baron’ – [[Pierre de Coubertin]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks:1&amp;tbo=p&amp;q=+inauthor:%22Ljubodrag+Simonovi%C4%87%22|title=inauthor:"Ljubodrag Simonović"|publisher=Ljubodrag Simonović via [[Google books]]|accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His books center around a critique of [[Olympism]] and professional sports.

He authored a piece about the mystery behind the 1987 death of German [[heptathlete]] [[Birgit Dressel]] at the age of 27.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbanbookcircle.com/the-death-of-birgit-dressel-by-ljubodrag-ldquoducirdquo-simonovic-phd.html The Death of Birgit Dressel – by Ljubodrag Simonović, PhD] at Urban Book Circle {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret Heafield was born in [[Paoli, Indiana]], to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (née Partington).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ruth Esther Heafield |url=http://wujekcalcaterra.tributes.com/show/Ruth-Esther-Heafield-89810802 |publisher=Wujek-Calcaterra &amp; Sons |accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from Hancock High School in 1954, she studied mathematics at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1955 and earned a B.A. in mathematics with a minor in philosophy from [[Earlham College]] in 1958.&lt;ref name="earlham"&gt;{{cite web |title=2009 Outstanding Alumni and Distinguished Service Awards |url=http://www.earlham.edu/alumni/homecoming-and-reunions/alumni-awards/award-recipient-archives/2009-outstanding-alumni-and-distinguished-service-awards/ |website=Earlham College |accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="michigan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pioneers in Computer Science|url=https://cs.usu.edu/news/pioneers-in-cs-margaret-hamilton|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917191701/https://cs.usu.edu/news/pioneers-in-cs-margaret-hamilton|archivedate=2016-09-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She briefly taught high school mathematics and French upon graduation, in order to support her husband while he worked on his undergraduate degree at Harvard, with the ultimate goal of pursuing a graduate degree at a later time. She moved to [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], with the intention of doing graduate study in [[abstract mathematics]] at [[Brandeis University]]. She cites a female math professor as helping her desire to pursue abstract mathematics. She had other inspirations outside the technological world, including her father, the philosopher and poet, and her grandfather, a school headmaster and Quaker Minister. She says these men inspired her to a minor in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://futurism.com/margaret-hamilton-the-untold-story-of-the-woman-who-took-us-to-the-moon/|title=Margaret Hamilton: The Untold Story of the Woman Who Took Us to the Moon|date=2016-07-20|newspaper=Futurism|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960 she took an interim position at [[MIT]] to develop software for predicting weather on the [[LGP-30]] and the [[PDP-1]] computers (at [[Marvin Minsky]]'s [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory#Project MAC|Project MAC]]) for professor [[Edward Norton Lorenz]] in the [[meteorology]] department.&lt;ref name="ProfessorLorenz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/lorenzcenter/about/LorenzPubs/The_Statistical_Prediction_of_Solutions_1962.pdf|last=Lorenz|first=Edward|title=The Statistical Prediction of Solutions|date=March 1962|publisher=the Meteorological Society of Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wayne2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Levy (1984), ''[[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]]'', Chapter 5: The Midnight Computer Wiring Society.

== SAGE Project ==
From 1961 to 1963, she worked on the [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment]] (SAGE) Project at [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory|Lincoln Lab]], where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the first [[AN/FSQ-7 Combat Direction Central|AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1)]], to search for unfriendly aircraft; she also wrote software for the [[Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories]].

The SAGE Project was an extension of [[Whirlwind I|Project Whirlwind]], started by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], to create a computer system that could predict weather systems and track their movements through simulators; [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] was soon developed for military use in anti-aircraft air defense from potential [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] attacks during the [[Cold War]]. Hamilton said, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;What they used to do when you came into this organization as a beginner, was to assign you this program which nobody was able to ever figure out or get to run. When I was the beginner they gave it to me as well. And what had happened was it was tricky programming, and the person who wrote it took delight in the fact that all of his comments were in Greek and Latin. So I was assigned this program and I actually got it to work. It even printed out its answers in Latin and Greek. I was the first one to get it to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AGC – Conference 1: Margaret Hamilton's introduction|url = http://authors.library.caltech.edu/5456/1/hrst.mit.edu/hrs/apollo/public/conference1/hamilton-intro.htm|website = authors.library.caltech.edu|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was her efforts on this project that made her a candidate for the position at NASA as the lead developer for Apollo flight software.

=== Apollo 11 ===
In one of the critical moments of the [[Apollo 11]] mission, the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]] together with the on-board flight software averted an abort of the landing on the Moon. Three minutes before the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar lander]] reached the Moon's surface, several computer alarms were triggered. The computer was overloaded with interrupts caused by incorrectly [[three-phase electric power|phased]] power supplied to the lander's rendezvous radar.&lt;ref name="EylesTales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlairSmith2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blair-Smith|first=Hugh|journal=IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine|volume=26|issue=11|pages=16–24|title=System integration issues in Apollo 11|date=November 7, 2011|doi=10.1109/MAES.2011.6065654}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USL/&gt; The program alarms indicated "executive overflows", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Collins |first1=Michael |last2=Aldrin |first2=Edwin E., Jr. |authorlink2=Buzz Aldrin |editor-last=Cortright |editor-first=Edgar M |editor-link=Edgar Cortright |title=Apollo Expeditions to the Moon |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-350/cover.html |accessdate=June 13, 2013 |date=1975 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=1623434 |id=NASA SP-350 |chapter=A Yellow Caution Light |chapterurl=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-350/ch-11-4.html}} Chapter 11.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The asynchronous executive designed by [[J.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Because of the flight software's system-software's error detection and recovery techniques that included its system-wide "kill and recompute" from a "safe place" restart approach to its snapshot and rollback techniques, the Display Interface Routines (AKA the priority displays) together with its man-in-the-loop capabilities were able to be created in order to have the capability to interrupt the astronauts' normal mission displays with priority displays of critical alarms in case of an emergency. This depended on our assigning a unique priority to every process in the software in order to ensure that all of its events would take place in the correct order and at the right time relative to everything else that was going on.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Snyder, Lawrence and Henry, Ray Laura, "Fluency7 with Information Technology", Pearson, {{ISBN|0-13-444872-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hamilton's priority alarm displays interrupted the astronauts' normal displays to warn them that there was an emergency "giving the astronauts a [[go/no go]] decision (to land or not to land)".&lt;ref name="MITNEWSMHH"&gt;{{Cite web

Hamilton wrote of the incident,

{{Quote|The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, ''I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks''; i.e., the ones needed for landing&amp;nbsp;... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones&amp;nbsp;... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing it was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=Margaret H. |authorlink=Margaret Hamilton (scientist) |date=March 1, 1971 |title=Computer Got Loaded |journal=[[Datamation]] |type=Letter |issn=0011-6963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1976 through 1984, Hamilton was the CEO of a company she co-founded called Higher Order Software (HOS) to further develop ideas about error prevention and fault tolerance emerging from her experience at MIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/5456/1/hrst.mit.edu/hrs/apollo/public/people/mhamilton.htm|title=AGC Biography – Margaret Hamilton|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They created a product called USE.IT, based on the HOS methodology developed at MIT.&lt;ref&gt;M.

"As will become clear, the "layers" in which the program is arranged, these being in the heart of the idea of structured programming, correspond to the levels of the tree."
Harel goes on to show at that time how HOS and his derived And/Or programming language relates to mathematical logic, game theory and artificial intelligence. Others have used HOS to formalize the semantics of linguistic quantifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Abstract-Control-Structures-And-The-Semantics-Of-Cushing/85e314b75794d9b95e8880edce81d472de1823ac|title=ABSTRACT CONTROL STRUCTURES.

Hamilton left the company, HOS, in 1985. In March 1986, she became the founder and CEO of Hamilton Technologies, Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Margaret H. Hamilton "is the person who came up with the idea of naming the discipline, "[[software engineering]]", as a way of giving it legitimacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;During this time at MIT, she wanted to give their software "legitimacy", just like with other engineering disciplines, so that it (and those building it) would be given its due respect; and, as a result she made up the term "software engineering" to distinguish it from other kinds of engineering.&lt;ref name=CHM/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hamilton details how she came about to make up the term "[[software engineering]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I first came up with the term, no one had heard of it before, at least in our world. It was an ongoing joke for a long time. They liked to kid me about my radical ideas. It was a memorable day when one of the most respected hardware gurus explained to everyone in a meeting that he agreed with me that the process of building software should also be considered an engineering discipline, just like with hardware. Not because of his acceptance of the new 'term' per se, but because we had earned his and the acceptance of the others in the room as being in an engineering field in its own right.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Hamilton started using the term "software engineering",&lt;ref name=50th&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nasa.gov/50th/50th_magazine/scientists.html | title=NASA Engineers and Scientists-Transforming Dreams Into Reality | last=Rayl | first=A.J.S. | date=October 16, 2008 | website=50th Magazine | publisher=[[NASA]] | accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cambridge.wickedlocal.com/article/20150108/NEWS/150107759/1007/OPINION|title=Cambridge woman helped put a man on the moon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/251093main_The_NASA_Heritage_Of_Creativity.pdf|title=The NASA Heritage Of Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; software engineering was not taken seriously compared to other engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.makers.com/margaret-hamilton|title=Makers:Margaret Hamilton Videos|publisher=Makers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor was it regarded as a science. She began to use the term "software engineering" during the early Apollo missions in order to give software the legitimacy of other fields such as hardware engineering. Over time the term "software engineering" has gained the same respect as any other discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@verne/margaret-hamilton-the-engineer-who-took-the-apollo-to-the-moon-7d550c73d3fa#.cgnapquz2|title=Margaret Hamilton, the Engineer Who Took the Apollo to the Moon|last=Verne|date=2014-12-25|website=Medium|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Margaret met her husband, James Cox Hamilton, while at Earlham College. They married in the late 1950s after Hamilton earned her bachelor's degree. They have a daughter, Lauren, as well as two grandchildren. According to her daughter, Margaret was the homecoming queen at Earlham College and James was the class president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stickgold|first1=Emma|title=James Cox Hamilton Dies, at 77|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/08/30/james-cox-hamilton-mentor-young-lawyers-also-handled-aclu-cases/CGoF5qLYsNnUEap7BuTrGJ/story.html|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the weekends she would often take her daughter to the lab to allow her to spend time with her daughter.

'''Melinda Bam''' (born 13May 1989) is a [[South Africa]]n TV Personality, presenting popular TV show Pasella &amp; Wies Jou Poppie (season 1-3), international model and beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned [[Miss South Africa|Miss South Africa 2011]], becoming the official representative of her [[South Africa|country]] to [[Miss Universe 2012]].&lt;ref name="TimesLive"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/entertainment/2011/12/11/tukkies-girl-crowned-miss-sa | title=Tukkies girl crowned Miss SA | publisher=Times Live | date=11 December 2011 | accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has a swimwear line called Bambshell, for which she worked with [[South Africa]]n swimwear brand.&lt;ref name="The New Age"/&gt; She is also owner of Women Empowerment Initiatives SHEnation &amp; Womentality [Co-founder].[[www.shenation.co.za]]

==Early life==
Melinda Bam (born Melinda de Kock) was raised in [[Pretoria]]. She was born in 1989 and has one sister, Melissa. She is a model and a student of B.Com Marketing from the [[University of Pretoria]]. She entered Miss South Africa 2011 and won the pageant on her first attempt.

==Miss South Africa 2011==
She was crowned Miss South Africa 2011 at an event held at the Sun City Super Bowl on 11 December 2011.&lt;ref name="TimesLive" /&gt;

==Miss Universe 2012==
Melinda Bam represented South Africa in December at [[Miss Universe 2012]], which was held in Las Vegas, and placed among the top 10.

She did not participate in the [[Miss World 2012]] pageant because if a contestant reaches the top three of the pageant she is not permitted to enter Miss Universe. The 1st princess Remona Moodley represented South Africa at Miss World 2012 instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/News/Miss-SA-out-runner-up-in-for-Miss-World-20120629 | title=Miss SA out, runner-up in for Miss World | date=2012-06-29 | accessdate=2014-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miss South Africa National Executive==
In June 2013 it was announced that Melinda Bam was appointed as National Executive for the Miss South Africa Pageant, and she would be in charge of arranging potential sponsors for the pageant, as well as preparing the outgoing queen to both the Miss World and Miss Universe Pageants. Her Management proved successful and partly due to her guidance, secured the crown for 2014 Miss World Title Holder, [[Rolene Strauss]]

==Personal life==

Her family name is of German origin. However, Bam is also a Xhosa name, making the public mistake her for a Xhosa girl before she won the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=PasellaTV|title=LAND: Ons landse mooiste!|date=2012-06-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgWnxyJu2bQ|accessdate=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bam announced in November 2013 that she is engaged to Mr South Africa 2011, Adriaan Bergh. The two former beauty pageant title carriers got engaged during a holiday in Dubai. They were married in November 2014 at Oakfield Farm, Gauteng, South Africa. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theprettyblog.com/wedding/melinda-bam-adriaan-berghs-forest-fairy-tale-wedding/|title=Melinda Bam &amp; Adriaan Bergh’s Forest Fairytale Wedding|work=The Pretty Blog|access-date=2018-01-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mikael Nilsson''', better known as '''Nattramn'''  (born 1977) is a Swedish musician and [[author]]. He is best known for his vocal performance in the band [[Silencer (band)|Silencer]]. On Silencer's sole album, [[Death - Pierce Me]], Nattramn utilized a bizarre style consisting of high-pitched shrieking and other extreme vocal techniques, allegedly exacerbated by self-harming while recording.

Little is known regarding the identity of Nattramn due to his choosing to live his life in [[anonymity]].&lt;ref name= historiaextravagante.com&gt;[http://historiaextravagante.com/natti-natti-nattramn/ Natti Natti Nattramn] Retrieved January 26, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; His age is disputed and his birth name is not confirmed - all that is known of him are the promotional photographs taken during his time as a member of Silencer, in which his face is entirely covered by bloodied bandages, one photo from a newspaper after his brother's suicide, and some later self-released photos in which his face is also obscured. He was born in [[Markaryd]], [[Småland]], Sweden.

== Life and career ==
Virtually nothing is known about Nattramn that predates Silencer's existence as a band.

Silencer was formed in 1995 as a solo project of guitarist/bassist Andreas Casado, under the pseudonym Leere. At some point prior to 1998, Nattramn was enlisted as the band's vocalist and lyricist. With this lineup, they recorded and released a single demo track with session drummer Jonas Mattsson. Following this, Silencer recorded and released the full-length album [[Death - Pierce Me]].

While recording the vocal parts on the album, Nattramn allegedly [[self-harm]]ed; cutting his wrists and hands. This contributed to his unique high-pitched wailing vocal style, which has been described as sounding like a dying animal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/34757/Silencer-SWE-Death---Pierce-Me/] Retrieved November 8, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

After the release of this album, it is rumoured that Nattramn entered [[:sv:Sankt Sigfrids sjukhus|Sankt Sigfrids sjukhus]], a [[psychiatric hospital]] located in [[Växjö]], although the circumstances surrounding his admission, and whether he was sectioned or went voluntarily, are subject to conjecture.&lt;ref name= historiaextravagante.com/&gt; It is said that following his stay, Nattramn chose to continue to live in Växjö.

After several years of inactivity, he created the [[dark ambient]] solo project Diagnose: Lebensgefahr and released an album, entitled Transformalin, in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diagnoselebensgefahr.com/ Diagnose:Lebensgefahr] Retrieved January 26, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.last.fm/pl/music/Nattramn Nattramn] Retrieved January 26, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he released a new piece of music entitled "Ödelagt", under the project name Trencadis. This 21-minute piece is described as the beginning of Nattramn's musical career, and was initially written and recorded several years prior to his joining Silencer. The track was said to have been written in 1994, under the project name Sinneskross, and is also in a dark ambient style which has been described as being reminiscent of [[Burzum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.discogs.com/Trencadis-%C3%96delagt/release/3682470] Retrieved November 8, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote a book, which was released in September 2011, entitled "Grishjärta" or "Pig's Heart". It was published in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[English language|English]], and contains new photos of Nattramn, as well as his artwork and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanianimaliliberati.com/grishjarta.htm Nattramn - Grisharta (2011)] Retrieved January 26, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Arabic name]]s, a '''nisba''' (also spelled ''nesba'', sometimes ''nesbat'' ; {{lang-ar|نسبة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|nisbah}}'', "attribution") is an adjective indicating the person's place of origin, tribal affiliation, or ancestry, used at the end of the name and occasionally ending in the [[suffix]] ''-iyy(ah)''. Nisbah is originally an Arabic word that was passed to many other languages such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]].

In the usage of Persian, Turkish and Urdu, it is pronounced/written exclusively ''nisbat''. In [[Arabic grammar|Arabic usage]], that pronunciation occurs when the word is uttered in its [[construct state#Arabic|construct state]] only.

The practice has been adopted in [[Iranian name]]s and South Asian Muslim names.  The nisba has sometimes become a [[surname]].

==Original use==
{{main article|Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba}}
A ''nisba'' "relation" is a grammatical term referring to the suffixation of masculine -''iyy'', feminine ''-iyyah'' to a word to make it an adjective. As an example, the word ''‘Arabiyy'' ({{lang|ar|عربي}}) means "Arab, related to Arabic, Arabian". Nisba forms are very common in Arabic names.

==Use in onomastics==
Traditional Arabic names do not include [[family names]] or [[surnames]], but rather [[patronymics]] (''nasab''), where the name of the person is followed by the name of his father, usually linked by ''ibn'' or ''bin'' ('son').  Patronymics may be long as they may include all known forefathers.  When a name is simplified to one or two ancestors, it may become confused with other persons' names, so an additional specifier, a ''nisba'', may be added as an attribute.

A nisba is usually prefixed by ''al'' ('the') and may be to almost anything:

'''Pauline Monica Mole''' (or '''Pauline Hilda''', depending on the book) (née '''Sugden''', previously '''Muffet''' and '''Braithwaite''') is a fictional character from the [[Adrian Mole]] series, written by [[Sue Townsend]].

==Biography==
Pauline was born in 1944 among the potato fields of Norfolk. She was the only girl, with two brothers called Dennis and Pete. She loathed this lifestyle, and when she fell in love with George Mole, she jumped at the chance to marry him. What she and George were unaware of was that when they got married, she was three months pregnant with [[Adrian Mole|Adrian]].

Pauline rejected Adrian for the first year of his life, leaving George to look after him and get taunted by the other men.

In 1982, Pauline has enough of George and has an affair with the Mole family's neighbour, Alan Lucas. She and Lucas eloped to Sheffield, and after they break off their relationship they secretly reconcile and Pauline becomes pregnant with a daughter, [[Rosie Mole|Rosie Germaine]]. Rosie's paternity is not solved until ''The Prostrate Years'', when they take the case to [[The Jeremy Kyle Show]]. The blood test results show Rosie is Lucas' daughter, leaving Pauline disgraced and George heartbroken. Pauline is 'seventy per cent sure' that Adrian is George's; she was friendly with a [[maggot]] farmer, Ernie, before Adrian was born.

Pauline leaves George twice afterwards – both times she gets married. The first time was to an [[engineer]], Martin Muffet, despite him being twenty-seven years younger than Pauline. She divorced him when he eloped with Adrian's girlfriend Bianca Dartington, also an engineer.

She remarries George, and divorces him later. She marries Ivan Braithwaite, the father of [[Pandora Braithwaite|Pandora]], the [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] Labour representative, whilst George marries Pandora's mother, Tania. It became known as 'The Great Mole/Braithwaite Parent Swap'.

After Ivan dies from drowning, George leaves Tania and remarries the widowed Pauline again, prompting large media press. The couple sell their home in Wisteria Walk, Adrian and Rosie's childhood home, and buy two old [[pigsty|pigsties]] which they convert into a [[semi-detached]] property, They inhabit one house, and Adrian inhabits the other with his wife Daisy and daughter Gracie. During the renovation, George suffers from a stroke and puts his back out, which therefore confines him to a wheelchair. Pauline doesn't know how to cope with the strain. When she finds out her first grandchild, Glenn, is going to be a father, she is excited at the thought of being a great-grandmother, as "she still kept her legs!".

==Television==
In ''[[The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole (TV series)|The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole]]'', she is portrayed by [[Julie Walters]]. In its follow-on series, ''[[The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole (TV series)|The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole]]'', she is played by [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]].

'''Phôngsali''' ([[Lao alphabet|Lao]] ຜົ້ງສາລີ) is a province of [[Laos]], located in the extreme north of the country. The capital of the province is the city of [[Phongsali|Phôngsali]].

Phongsali Province covers an area of {{convert|16270|km2}}, out of which 77% has forest cover. The province borders China to the north and west, [[Vietnam]] to the east, [[Luang Prabang Province]] to the south, and [[Oudomxai Province]] to the southwest. The highest mountain in the province is [[Phou Doychy]] with an elevation of {{convert|1842|m}} Protected areas in the province include the [[Phou Dene Din National Biodiversity Conservation Area]] and Nam Lan Conservation Area.&lt;ref name=Eco&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecotourismlaos.com/phongsaly.htm|title=Phongsaly Province|work=Ecotourism Laos|author=The Lao National Tourism Administration|publisher=GMS Sustainable Tourism Development Project in Lao PDR|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture is the mainstay of the people of the province. Phôngsali is the primary trade gateway between Laos and China, exporting lumber and importing several types of finished goods.

==History==
The Phu Noi left [[Muang Sing]] or [[Burma]] and arrived in Phongsaly at the end of the 18th century.{{sfn|Michaud|2006|p=193}} The Hmong settled in Phongsaly at the end of the 19th century, having migrated from southern China.{{sfn|Tan|2007|p=354}} In 1895, a Sino-French treaty transferred the Tai Lue's [[Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture|Sip Song Phan Na]] principalities of Phongsaly and [[Muang Sing]] to French Laos.{{sfn|Michaud|2006|p=21}} Between 1908 and 1910, the Tai Lue conducted a revolt against colonial authority. When it ended, the colonial military assumed full authority in Phongsaly.{{sfn|Michaud|2006|p=147}} In 1936, [[Sithon Kommadam]] and his brother, Kamphanh were jailed in Phongsaly because of their participation in their father's (Ong Kommandam) 1934–1936 armed revolt against the French.{{sfn|Michaud|2006|p=218}} After Sithon's release in 1945, he established resistance bases in Phongsaly, soon making contact with the Viet Minh.{{sfn|Pholsena|2006|p=41}} The Communists came into power in 1954 in the province; within six years, the Phunoy began experiencing Buddhist religious purges.{{sfn|Williams|Ladwig|2012|p=100}} Subsequent to the [[Geneva Conference (1954)#The Geneva Accords|1954 Geneva Accords]], Communist [[Pathet Lao]] forces in Phongsaly province were provided with regrouping zones. Phongsaly was integrated into the [[Royal Lao Government]] on December 18, 1957.{{sfn|Van Dijk|2008|p=531-532}}

==Geography==
Phongsali Province covers an area of {{convert|16270|km2}}, out of which 77% has forest cover.&lt;ref name="LT"/&gt;  The province borders [[China]] to the north and west, [[Vietnam]] to the east, [[Luang Prabang Province]] to the south, and [[Oudomxai Province]] to the southwest.&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;{{cite map|title= Maps|publisher=[[Google Maps]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located high in the mountains, approximately {{convert|450|-|1800|m}} above sea level.

==Economy==
[[File:Phongali Street.JPG|thumb|right|Street in Phongsali]]
Agriculture is the mainstay of the people of the province. Phôngsali is the primary trade gateway between Laos and China, exporting lumber and importing several types of finished goods. There are also several Chinese manufacturing companies in the province, along with other foreign investment.&lt;ref name="LT"/&gt;

As an economic activity 24 villages have been identified to install  mini hydro-power projects with pico-turbines to provide electric supply utilizing the hydro power potential of the hilly areas which have good monsoon rainfall. Local material will be used for construction of civil works and villagers trained to plan, implement and operate the units including maintenance of all components of the project covering transmission lines also. The objective is to reduce poverty among the rural poor of the remote villages. The project is proposed for implementation at a cost of [[Euro]] 210,000 with 48% financing by the Energy and Environment Partnership (EEP)of Mekong with Electriciens Sand Frontieres as lead partner. The project is slated for implementation over a 20 months period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:HaGWmzZEjtkJ:www.ndf.fi/fileadmin/resources/documents/1laos-L-PPF-24120901.pdf|title=Green Electricity for 24 villages of the Phonsalay district , Phonsalay Province, Laos|accessdate=2 December 2012|publisher= Energy and Environment Partnership (EEP)of Mekong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruzbahan ibn Vindadh-Khurshid''' ({{lang-fa|روزبهان بن ونداد خورشید}}), better known as '''Ruzbahan''' (also spelled as '''Rezbahan'''), was a [[Daylamite]] military officer who served the [[Buyid dynasty]]. A native of [[Daylam]], Ruzbahan began serving the Buyids at an unknown date and quickly rose into high ranks. After constant pressure from king [[Mu'izz al-Dawla]] to conquer [[Batihah]], he, along with his two brothers, started a rebellion lasting from 955 to 957. After the end of the rebellion, Ruzbahan was imprisoned and shortly executed.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and career ===
[[File:Iraq Ninth Century.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of Iraq in the 9th–10th centuries]]
Ruzbahan was the son of a certain Vindadh-Khurshid, and had two brothers named Asfar and Bullaka. Like his Buyid overlords, Ruzbahan was a Daylamite. However, unlike the Buyids, he probably belonged to a family of noble origin. When the Buyid ruler [[Mu'izz al-Dawla]] conquered [[Iraq]] in 945, Ruzbahan was appointed as the tax collector of the [[Sawad]].{{sfn|Donohue|2003|p=37}} Ruzbahan was originally a low rank officer who served a Buyid officer named Musa Fayadhah.{{sfn|Amedroz|Margoliouth|1921|p=173}} However, under Mu'izz al-Dawla he rapidly rose to higher ranks and became a [[favourite]] of Mu'izz al-Dawla.{{sfn|Donohue|2003|p=41}}

In 948/949, during negotiations between Mu'izz al-Dawla's and the [[Sallarid]] ruler [[Marzuban ibn Muhammad|Marzuban]]'s ambassadors, Marzuban was greatly insulted, and became enraged; he tried to avenge himself by marching towards Ray, which was under the control of Mu'izz al-Dawla's brother [[Rukn al-Dawla]]. Rukn al-Dawla, however, managed to trick and slow Marzuban down by diplomatic means,{{sfn|Bosworth|1975|p=234}} while he was receiving aid from Mu'izz al-Dawla, who sent an army under Sebük-Tegin, which also included other officer such as Ruzbahan, Burarish, Ibrahim ibn al-Mutawwaq, 'Ammar "the Mad", and Ahmad ibn Salih Kilabi.{{sfn|Amedroz|Margoliouth|1921|p=122}} However, when the army was close to [[Dinavar]], Burarish, who disliked Sebük-Tegin and refused to obey the orders of the latter, mutinied along with most of the Daylamites in the army, except Ruzbahan and other Daylamite officers. Burarish shortly heavily wounded Sebük-Tegin, who, however, managed to flee from the latter.{{sfn|Amedroz|Margoliouth|1921|p=122}} For unknown reasons, Burarish shortly fled, but was quickly captured by the supporters of Sebük-Tegin.{{sfn|Amedroz|Margoliouth|1921|p=122}} The army of Sebük-Tegin then continued to Ray, and at the same time, reinforcements arrived from [[Shiraz]]. Rukn al-Dawla shortly managed to defeat and capture Marzuban.

In 949, Mu'izz al-Dawla sent Ruzbahan on an expedition against the [[Batihah]] ruler [['Imran ibn Shahin]]. Ruzbahan discovered 'Imran's location and attacked him, but was heavily defeated and forced to withdraw. 'Imran then became even more bold, with his subjects demanding protection money from anyone, including government officials, that crossed their path, and the path to Basra by water was effectively closed off. Mu'izz al-Dawla, after receiving numerous complaints from his officers, sent another army in 950 or 951, under the joint command of Ruzbahan and the amir's vizier [[Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Muhallabi|al-Muhallabi]].

Ruzbahan, who disliked the vizier, convinced him to directly attack 'Imran. He kept his forces in the rear and fled as soon as fighting between the two sides began. 'Imran used the terrain effectively, laying ambushes and confusing al-Muhallabi's army. Many of the vizier's soldiers died in the fighting and he himself only narrowly escaped capture, swimming to safety. Mu'izz al-Dawla then came to terms with 'Imran, acceding to his terms. Prisoners were exchanged and 'Imran was made a vassal of the Buyids, being instated as governor of the Batihah.

=== Rebellion ===
Peace lasted for approximately five years between the two sides. During this period, a marriage was being arranged between a daughter of Ruzbahan and Mu'izz al-Dawla's son [[Izz al-Dawla]].{{sfn|Donohue|2003|p=64}} A false rumor of Mu'izz al-Dawla's death in 955, however, prompted 'Imran to seize a Buyid convoy traveling from [[Ahvaz]] to [[Baghdad]]. Mu'izz demanded that the items confiscated be returned, at which point 'Imran returned the money gained, but kept the goods taken. Ruzbahan was then for a third time sent to the swamp, but shortly revolted along with his brother Asfar and spared 'Imran from a new attack.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=221}}{{sfn|Donohue|2003|p=41}} Ruzbahan's other brother, Bullaka, joined the rebellion and revolted at [[Shiraz]]. Ruzbahan was further joined by the Daylamite soldiers of al-Muhallabi. Ruzbahan quickly marched towards Ahvaz, where al-Muhallabi was preparing a counter-attack. However, the troops of al-Muhallabi quickly deserted him and joined Ruzbahan.{{sfn|Amedroz|Margoliouth|1921|p=173}} Ruzbahan then marched towards Mu'izz al-Dawla, who sent an army under his Daylamite general Shirzil, who, however, shortly, along with his army, joined the rebellion of Ruzbahan. In 956, Mu'izz al-Dawla left Baghdad in order to fight Ruzbahan himself. Meanwhile, the [[Hamdanid]] ruler [[Nasir al-Dawla]] used this opportunity to seize Baghdad.

In 957, Ruzbahan fought a final battle against Mu'izz al-Dawla. Ruzbahan almost managed to win the battle, but was defeated by Mu'izz al-Dawla's ''[[ghulams]]''. The defeat marked the end of Ruzbahan's rebellion.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=217}} Ruzbahan was captured during the battle and was imprisoned in a fortress known as Sarat.{{sfn|Amedroz|Margoliouth|1921|p=178}} 

=== Captivity and death ===
The Daylamite supporters of Ruzbahan then began planning to capture the fortress and rescue Ruzbahan. However, Abu'l-Abbas Musafir, an officer of Mu'izz al-Dawla, managed to discover of the Daylamite's plan, and quickly urged Mu'izz al-Dawla to have Ruzbahan killed. Mu'izz al-Dawla, however, did not agree with him. A number of Mu'izz al-Dawla's officer shortly told him the same, which made him agree with them. When it became night, the guards of Mu'izz al-Dawla took Ruzbahan to the [[Tigris river]], where he was drowned.{{sfn|Kabir|1964|p=13}}{{sfn|Amedroz|Margoliouth|1921|p=178}}

'''Susanna Paasonen''' (born 1975, Helsinki) is a Finnish feminist scholar. She is a  Professor of Media Studies at the [[University of Turku]], and was a visiting scholar at MIT in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cmsw.mit.edu/people/visitors-postdoctoral-associates/|title=Visitors and Postdoctoral Associates - MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing|website=MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; She gained her [[PhD]] from the University of Turku in 2002; her dissertation was on gender and the popularization of the internet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree= PhD | last = Paasonen | first = Susanna | title = Figures of fantasy: women, cyberdiscourse, and the popular Internet | publisher = [[University of Turku]] | location = Turku | year = 2002 | isbn = 9789512921348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later published through [[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Paasonen | first = Susanna | title = Figures of fantasy: Internet, women, and cyberdiscourse | publisher = Peter Lang | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780820476070 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After holding positions at the universities of Tampere, Jyväskylä and Helsinki, Paasonen was appointed Professor of Media Studies at the University of Turku on 1 August 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.utu.fi/en/units/hum/units/media-studies/Pages/Susanna-Paasonen.aspx | title = Profile: Susanna Paasonen, Professor of Media Studies at the University of Turku | accessdate = 7 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and publishes on internet research, media theory, sexuality, pornography and affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Paasonen | first = Susanna | title = Home page | url = https://susannapaasonen.org/ | website = susannapaasonen.org/ | via = [[WordPress]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
On Monday, 4 April 2016, Paasonen gave a lecture at [[Brown University]] in the USA  on the politics and culture of online porn.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brown.edu/academics/modern-culture-and-media/events-2015-2016&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay, "Glimmers of the forbidden fruit: Reminiscing pornography, conceptualizing the archive,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paasonen | first1 = Susanna | last2 = Kyrölä | first2 = Katariina | title = Glimmers of the forbidden fruit: reminiscing pornography, conceptualizing the archive | journal = [[International Journal of Cultural Studies]] | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1367877915580625 | date = April 2015 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1367877915580625 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; written along with Katariina Kyrölä, Paasonen traces the evolution of the "porn stash" from a physical collection to a digital one, and in doing so, examines cyberporn as a site of identity formation. She and Kyrölä suggest that pornography occasions the accumulation of a somatic archive, which are "not merely reservoirs of extra-cognitive sensation but also knowingly curated, reflected upon and reworked: they are simultaneously material and semiotic, intimate and culturally specific, affective and open to representation." In her lecture at Brown, Paasonen suggested that digital pornography must not be understood as something that creeps into society from the outside, but rather as something that already exists in contemporary culture. She writes, "Encounters with pornography therefore become incorporated as carnal capacity-- as what we can imagine our bodies enjoying and being capable of, or not enjoying and being capable of." Paasonen argues, therefore, that interactions with pornography, therefore, can contribute to the development of an individual's sexual identity.

== Awards ==
The [[Finnish Academy of Science and Letters|Finnish Academy of Science]] awarded her the Jutikkala Prize of €15,000 14 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jutikkala Award for Media Studies Professor Susanna Paasonen | url = http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/Jutikkala-palkinto+mediatutkimuksen+professori+Susanna+Paasoselle/a1305549365815 | publisher = Helsingin Sanomat (Finnish) | accessdate = 7 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Paasonen published the book, ''Carnal Resonance: Affect and Online Pornography'', through MIT Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Paasonen | first = Susanna | title = Carnal resonance affect and online pornography | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Mass | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780262016315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The San Diego Ghost Hunters''' is an intimate team of [[paranormal investigator]]s based in [[San Diego]], [[California]], [[United States|USA]], that specializes in assisting historical [[landmark]] owners discover or confirm occupants and events that have passed from our mortal plane but still exist in [[spirit]] form.

sdGH principals include family and friends who together have been unlocking [[history]] for over forty years. Their investigations combine advanced tools and skills ranging from the intuitive and [[psychic]] to high-tech environmental monitoring. Collected evidence is researched using [[genealogy]] and historical societies, and when required, the sdGH's association of [[archaeologist]]s and published [[historian]]s.

sdGH is proud of its premium reputation. So impressed with its respectful investigation protocol, the team is regularly re-invited to investigate invaluable landmarks and has been tapped by San Diego's infamous [[Whaley House, San Diego, California|Whaley House Museum]] to conduct monthly public paranormal investigation tours. Long considered to be one of America's most haunted, The Whaley House has been noted as such by past [[US Commerce Department]] promotional material.

With the team's unique mix of intuitive and psychic talent, extensive high-tech environmental monitoring, historical research, and many media appearances including television's [[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]], the [[Travel Channel]] Network, and The Biography Channel, The San Diego Ghost Hunters has become the go-to group for all things paranormal throughout historical San Diego and [[Southern California]].

sdGH's services are complimentary to its clients. No monetary charges are made or [[donation]]s accepted, and no [[merchandise]] of any kind is sold from the team's site. This keeps [[commerce]] and their work fully separate, a dynamic sdGH feels is critical for investigative integrity.

== Notable Investigations ==
In addition to a multitude of Whaley House Museum investigations, The San Diego Ghost Hunters have focused its attention on a long list of fascinating locations including: The Queen Mary Historic Ship, [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach, CA]]; David Oman House, [[Cielo Drive]], [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood, CA]]—40th Anniversary Date of [[Sharon Tate]] Murders; [[Lizzie Borden]] House, [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River, MA]]; [[Bird Cage Theatre|Birdcage Theater]], [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone, AZ]]; Villisca Axe Murder House, [[Villisca, Iowa|Villisca, IA]]; [[Hotel del Coronado]], [[Coronado, California|Coronado, CA]]; [[Waverly Hills Sanatorium]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, KY]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegoghosthunters.com/investigations/investigations-lead.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314145207/http://www.sandiegoghosthunters.com/investigations/investigations-lead.html |archivedate=2011-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2004, sdGH has regularly investigated [[San Diego Maritime Museum]], [[Star of India (ship)|The Star of India]]. The team's two appearances many years ago on Southern California television featured its work on the historic ship and helped ignite the attention she enjoys today within the [[paranormal]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegoghosthunters.com/media/media-lead.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031004703/http://www.sandiegoghosthunters.com/media/media-lead.html |archivedate=2010-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a later date, an episode of television's Ghost Hunters was filmed at the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.syfy.com/ghosthunters |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303021850/http://www.syfy.com/ghosthunters/ |archivedate=2011-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Association with The San Diego Whaley House Museum ==
Since its founding, The San Diego Ghost Hunters has taken a special interest in the San Diego Whaley House Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whaleyhouse.org Whaley House Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; It symbolizes all that drives the team: A premier national historic landmark that enjoys recognition around the globe as one of America's most haunted locations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hauntedamericatours.com/toptenhaunted/ The Top Ten Most Haunted List 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Built in 1857 by businessman [[Thomas Whaley]], the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek revival]]-style house became a driving force in early San Diego as it housed at different times a [[general store]], [[granary]], [[morgue]], [[courthouse]], and the town's first public [[theater]] during its commercial years. It seems after 150 years, Mr. Whaley and his family still are looking after the house as experiences of the paranormal kind are reported on an almost daily basis. After working closely with sdGH on various historical projects and recognizing the respectful protocol the team brings to its investigations, museum management asked sdGH to co-host monthly Paranormal Investigation Tours in the fall of 2008.

=== Whaley House Museum Paranormal Investigation Tours ===

Since fall 2008, The San Diego Ghost Hunters have co-hosted Whaley House Museum Paranormal Investigation Tours, the first event of its kind offered in San Diego. Presented late night on the last weekend of each month, an intimate number of guest investigators learn about the historical family that built the legendary home and helped establish San Diego as an emerging city, are introduced to paranormal investigation tools and techniques, then put them to use to discover why the US Department of Commerce has published the Whaley House as a [[haunted location]] within vintage promotional material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/getaways/112196/dest21_top.html Home's haunted history is even government certified]&lt;/ref&gt; sdGH provides its co-host duties on a [[Volunteering|volunteer]]-basis—as a service to the community. One hundred percent of all [[ticket (admission)|ticket]] fees collected are applied to the maintenance and restoration of the [[museum]] and historical advocacy programs. The tours have been very popular with sell-outs occurring every month for over three years, at times before tour dates are publicly announced. In late summer 2011, sdGH and museum management shook hands to extend their tour partnership through 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegoghosthunters.com/whaley/whaley-house-museum.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317032523/http://www.sandiegoghosthunters.com/whaley/whaley-house-museum.html |archivedate=2011-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media Contributions ==
Being a premier Southern California investigation team, The San Diego Ghost Hunters has been tapped for media consultation since its founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegoghosthunters.com/media/media-lead.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031004703/http://www.sandiegoghosthunters.com/media/media-lead.html |archivedate=2010-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Appearances have included The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Travel Channel's [[Halloween]] special "Most Terrifying Places in America",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelchannel.com/Places_Trips/Travel_Ideas/Haunted_Travels/Most_Terrifying_Places_In_America]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bio Channel's "My Ghost Story", a multitude of Southern California [[television news]] broadcasts and morning shows,  [[newspaper]] features, technical consultation with [[VH1]] Network, and contributions to books detailing haunted locations and stories edited by popular author, historian, archeologist Robert Wlodarski&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=i%3Astripbooks%2Cp_27%3ARobert%20Wlodarski&amp;field-author=Robert%20Wlodarski Amazon.com: Robert Wlodarski: Books]&lt;/ref&gt; and acclaimed author Troy Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prairieghosts.com/ American Hauntings: Where Dead Men Still Tell Tales]&lt;/ref&gt; Team members have also been featured on numerous radio programs including those on the Haunted Voices Radio Network&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hvrn.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and BIM Paranormal Radio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beyondinvestigation.com/ Beyond Investigation Magazine - The Online Chronicle on ghost hunting and other paranormal investigations]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vernon Thomas Morgan''' (August 8, 1928 – November 8, 1975) was an American [[third baseman]] and [[coach (baseball)|coach]] in [[Major League Baseball]], and a manager and longtime player (1948–64) at the [[minor league baseball|minor league level]]. A native of [[Emporia, Virginia]], who attended the [[University of Richmond]], Morgan threw right-handed, batted left-handed, stood {{height|ft=6|in=1}} (185&amp;nbsp;cm) tall and weighed 185 pounds (84&amp;nbsp;kg).

Morgan's Major League playing career consisted of 31 games and 71 [[at bats]] for the [[1954 in baseball|1954]]–[[1955 in baseball|1955]] [[Chicago Cubs]]. Morgan collected 16 [[hit (baseball)|hits]], including two [[double (baseball)|doubles]], and [[runs batted in|drove in]] three runs, [[batting average|batting]] .225. In 1956, he was acquired by the [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]] organization, and he would spend the rest of his baseball career in the employ of the franchise (which became the [[Minnesota Twins]] in 1961). Morgan played for the Senators' Double-A [[farm system|farm club]], the [[Chattanooga Lookouts]] of the [[Southern Association]], from 1956 through mid-1960. As a 28-year-old veteran, Morgan had his best minor-league season for the 1957 Lookouts, batting .332 with 14 [[home runs]] and 92 RBI and making the SA all-star team as an [[outfielder]].

'''Vladimir Kojève''', or '''Khodzhev''', was a Russian [[major-general]] who acted as a military advisor to the government of [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CONFIRMED: A Top Russian General Was Killed By Syrian Rebels While Advising Assad|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/russian-general-killed-by-syrian-rebels-2012-10|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=Business Insider|date=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was allegedly killed in the [[Syrian civil war]]. In October 2012, after his death, personal documents were published by [[Al Arabiya]] which suggested he was working as part of a contract under which the Russian government provided security assistance to the [[Bashar Assad|Assad]] regime; documents suggested he had access to all security facilities in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leaks confirm death of top Russian general in Syria|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/10/03/241644.html|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=Al Arabiya|date=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
