'''Behaviorally anchored rating scales''' ('''BARS''') are [[scale (social sciences)|scales]] used to rate [[job performance|performance]]. BARS are normally presented vertically with scale points ranging from five to nine. It is an appraisal method that aims to combine the benefits of narratives, critical incidents, and quantified ratings by anchoring a quantified scale with specific narrative examples of good, moderate, and poor performance.&lt;ref&gt;Management of Human Resources, Gary Dessler{{pn|date=November 2016}}{{full|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
BARS were developed in response to dissatisfaction with the subjectivity involved in using traditional rating scales such as the graphic rating [[scale (social sciences)|scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0047060 |title=Retranslation of expectations: An approach to the construction of unambiguous anchors for rating scales |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=149–55 |year=1963 |last1=Smith |first1=Patricia Cain |last2=Kendall |first2=L. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of BARS concluded that the strength of this rating format may lie primarily in the performance dimensions which are gathered rather than the distinction between behavioral and numerical scale anchors.&lt;ref name="shd"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1975.tb01392.x |title=Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales: A Review of the Literature |journal=Personnel Psychology |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=549–62 |year=1975 |last1=Schwab |first1=Donald P. |last2=Heneman |first2=Herbert G. |last3=Decotiis |first3=Thomas A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of BARS==
BARS are rating scales that add behavioral scale anchors to traditional rating scales (e.g., graphic rating scales). In comparison to other rating scales, BARS are intended to facilitate more accurate ratings of the target person's behavior or performance. However, whereas the BARS is often regarded as a superior [[performance appraisal]] method, BARS may still suffer from [[reliability (statistics)|unreliability]], [[leniency bias]] and lack of [[discriminant validity]] between performance dimensions.&lt;ref name="shd"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1981.tb00942.x |title=A Critical Analysis of Studies Comparing Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales (Bars) and Other Rating Formats |journal=Personnel Psychology |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=263–89 |year=1981 |last1=Kingstrom |first1=Paul O. |last2=Bass |first2=Alan R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developing BARS==
BARS are developed using data collected through the [[critical incident technique]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0061470 |pmid=13177800 |title=The critical incident technique |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=327–58 |year=1954 |last1=Flanagan |first1=John C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; or through the use of comprehensive data about the tasks performed by a job incumbent, such as might be collected through a task analysis. In order to construct BARS, several basic steps, outlined below, Is followed.
# Examples of effective and ineffective behavior related to job are collected from people with knowledge of job using the critical incident technique. Alternatively, data may be collected through the careful examination of data from a recent task analysis.
# These data are then converted into performance dimensions. To convert these data into performance dimensions, examples of behavior (such as critical incidents) are sorted into homogeneous groups using the Q-sort technique. Definitions for each group of behaviors are then written to define each grouping of behaviors as a performance dimension
# A group of subject matter experts (SMEs) are asked to re-translate the behavioral examples back into their respective performance dimensions. At this stage the behaviors for which there is not a high level of agreement (often 50–75%) are discarded while the behaviors which were re-translated back into their respective performance dimensions with a high level of SME agreement are retained. The re-translation process helps to ensure that behaviors are readily identifiable with their respective performance dimensions.
# The retained behaviors are then scaled by having SMEs rate the effectiveness of each behavior. These ratings are usually done on a 5- to 9-point Likert-type scale.
# Behaviors with a low [[standard deviation]] (for examples, less than 1.50) are retained while behaviors with a higher standard deviation are discarded. This step helps to ensure SME agreement about the rating of each behavior.
# Finally, behaviors for each performance dimensions, all meeting re-translation and criteria, will be used as scale anchors.

[[File:Bernoulli_numbers_graphs.svg|thumb|Graphs of modern Bernoulli numbers, {{math|''B''}} (circles) compared with Bernoulli numbers in older literature, {{math|''B''*}} (crosses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bernoulli Number|publisher=Wolfram MathWorld|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BernoulliNumber.html|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''Bernoulli numbers''' {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are a [[sequence]] of [[rational number]]s which occur frequently in [[number theory]]. The values of the first 20 Bernoulli numbers are given in the adjacent table. For every even {{math|''n''}} other than 0, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is negative if {{math|''n''}} is divisible by 4 and positive otherwise. For every odd {{math|''n''}} other than 1, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}.

The superscript ± used in this article designates the two sign conventions for Bernoulli numbers. Only the {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} term is affected: 
*{{math|''B''{{su|p=−|b=''n''}}}} with {{math|1=''B''{{su|p=−|b=1}} = −{{sfrac|1|2}}}} ({{OEIS2C|id=A027641}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}) is the sign convention prescribed by [[NIST]] and most modern textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arfken |first=George |date=1970 |title=Mathematical methods for physicists (2nd edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |page=278 |isbn=978-0120598519 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{math|''B''{{su|p=+|b=''n''}}}} with {{math|1=''B''{{su|p=+|b=1}} = +{{sfrac|1|2}}}} ({{OEIS2C|id=A164555}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}) is sometimes used in the older literature.&lt;ref name="MW1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bernoulli Number|publisher=Wolfram MathWorld|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BernoulliNumber.html|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the formulas below, one can switch from one sign convention to the other with the relation &lt;math&gt;B_n^{+{}}=(-1)^n B_n^{-{}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Bernoulli numbers are special values of the [[Bernoulli polynomial]]s &lt;math&gt;B_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;B^{-{}}_n=B_n(0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B^+_n=B_n(1)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="MW1"/&gt;

Since {{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} for all odd {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}, and many formulas only involve even-index Bernoulli numbers, some authors write "{{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}" to mean {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  This article does not follow this notation.

The Bernoulli numbers appear in the [[Taylor series]] expansions of the [[tangent function|tangent]] and [[Hyperbolic function|hyperbolic tangent]] functions, in [[Faulhaber's formula]] for the sum of powers of the first positive integers, in the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula]], and in expressions for certain values of the [[Riemann zeta function]].

The Bernoulli numbers were discovered around the same time by the Swiss mathematician [[Jacob Bernoulli]], after whom they are named, and independently by Japanese mathematician [[Takakazu Seki|Seki Kōwa]].  Seki's discovery was posthumously published in 1712&lt;ref name="selin 1997"&gt;Selin, H. (1997), p. 891&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith mikami 1914"&gt;Smith, D. E. (1914), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;  in his work ''Katsuyo Sampo''; Bernoulli's, also posthumously, in his ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]'' of 1713.  [[Ada Lovelace]]'s [[Ada Byron's notes on the analytical engine|note G]] on the [[Analytical Engine]] from 1842 describes an [[algorithm]] for generating Bernoulli numbers with [[Charles Babbage|Babbage]]'s machine.&lt;ref&gt;''Note G'' in the Menabrea reference&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Bernoulli numbers have the distinction of being the subject of the first published complex [[computer program]].

==History==

=== Early history ===

The Bernoulli numbers are rooted in the early history of the computation of sums of integer powers, which have been of interest to mathematicians since antiquity.

[[File:Seki Kowa Katsuyo Sampo Bernoulli numbers.png|thumb|right|A page from Seki Takakazu's ''Katsuyo Sampo'' (1712), tabulating binomial coefficients and Bernoulli numbers]]

Methods to calculate the sum of the first {{mvar|n}} positive integers, the sum of the squares and of the cubes of the first {{mvar|n}} positive integers were known, but there were no real 'formulas', only descriptions given entirely in words. Among the great mathematicians of antiquity to consider this problem were [[Pythagoras]] (c. 572–497&amp;nbsp;BCE, Greece), [[Archimedes]] (287–212&amp;nbsp;BCE, Italy), [[Aryabhata]] (b. 476, India), [[Abu Bakr al-Karaji]] (d. 1019, Persia) and Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Hasan ibn [[al-Haytham]] (965–1039, Iraq).

During the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries mathematicians made significant progress.  In the West [[Thomas Harriot]] (1560–1621) of England, [[Johann Faulhaber]] (1580–1635) of Germany, [[Pierre de Fermat]] (1601–1665) and fellow French mathematician [[Blaise Pascal]] (1623–1662) all played important roles.

Thomas Harriot seems to have been the first to derive and write formulas for sums of powers using symbolic notation, but even he calculated only up to the sum of the fourth powers.  Johann Faulhaber gave formulas for sums of powers up to the 17th power in his 1631 ''Academia Algebrae'', far higher than anyone before him, but he did not give a general formula.

Blaise Pascal in 1654 proved [[Faulhaber's formula|''Pascal's identity'']] relating the sums of the {{math|''p''}}th powers of the first {{math|''n''}} positive integers for {{math|''p'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2, …, ''k''}}.

The Swiss mathematician Jakob Bernoulli (1654–1705) was the first to realize the existence of a single sequence of constants {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,…}} which provide a uniform formula for all sums of powers {{harv|Knuth|1993}}.

The joy Bernoulli experienced when he hit upon the pattern needed to compute quickly and easily the coefficients of his formula for the sum of the {{mvar|c}}th powers for any positive integer {{math|''c''}} can be seen from his comment. He wrote:

:"With the help of this table, it took me less than half of a quarter of an hour to find that the tenth powers of the first 1000 numbers being added together will yield the sum 91,409,924,241,424,243,424,241,924,242,500."

Bernoulli's result was published posthumously in ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]'' in 1713.  [[Seki Kōwa]] independently discovered the Bernoulli numbers and his result was published a year earlier, also posthumously, in 1712.&lt;ref name="selin 1997"/&gt;  However, Seki did not present his method as a formula based on a sequence of constants.

Bernoulli's formula for sums of powers is the most useful and generalizable formulation to date. The coefficients in Bernoulli's formula are now called Bernoulli numbers, following a suggestion of [[Abraham de Moivre]].

Bernoulli's formula is sometimes called [[Faulhaber's formula]] after Johann Faulhaber who found remarkable ways to calculate sum of powers but never stated Bernoulli's formula. To call Bernoulli's formula Faulhaber's formula does injustice to Bernoulli and simultaneously hides the genius of Faulhaber as Faulhaber's formula is in fact more efficient than Bernoulli's formula. According to Knuth {{harv|Knuth|1993}} a rigorous proof of Faulhaber's formula was first published by [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]] in 1834 {{harv|Jacobi|1834}}. Knuth's in-depth study of Faulhaber's formula concludes (the nonstandard notation on the LHS is explained further on):

:''"Faulhaber never discovered the Bernoulli numbers; i.e., he never realized that a single sequence of constants'' {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,}} ''… would provide a uniform''

:''for all sums of powers. He never mentioned, for example, the fact that almost half of the coefficients turned out to be zero after he had converted his formulas for'' {{math|∑ ''n&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''}} ''from polynomials in {{mvar|N}} to polynomials in {{mvar|n}}."  {{harv|Knuth|1993|p=14}}''

=== Reconstruction of "Summae Potestatum" ===

[[File:JakobBernoulliSummaePotestatum.png|thumb|right|upright=2.5|Jakob Bernoulli's "Summae Potestatum", 1713]]

The Bernoulli numbers {{OEIS2C|id=A164555}}(n)/{{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}(n) were introduced by Jakob Bernoulli in the book ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]'' published posthumously in 1713 page 97. The main formula can be seen in the second half of the corresponding facsimile. The constant coefficients denoted {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''D''}} by Bernoulli are mapped to the notation which is now prevalent as {{math|''A'' {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''B'' {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''C'' {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''D'' {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The expression {{math|''c''·''c''−1·''c''−2·''c''−3}} means {{math|''c''·(''c''−1)·(''c''−2)·(''c''−3)}} – the small dots are used as grouping symbols. Using today's terminology these expressions are [[Pochhammer symbol|falling factorial powers]] {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;{{underline|''k''}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The factorial notation {{math|''k''!}} as a shortcut for {{math|1 × 2 × … × ''k''}} was not introduced until 100 years later. The integral symbol on the left hand side goes back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1675 who used it as a long letter {{math|''S''}} for "summa" (sum). (The ''Mathematics Genealogy Project''&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/ Mathematics Genealogy Project]&lt;/ref&gt;
shows Leibniz as the academic&lt;!--not doctoral--&gt; advisor of Jakob Bernoulli. See also the ''Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeff560.tripod.com/calculus.html Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus]&lt;/ref&gt;) The letter {{math|''n''}} on the left hand side is not an index of [[summation]] but gives the upper limit of the range of summation which is to be understood as {{math|1, 2, …, ''n''}}. Putting things together, for positive {{math|''c''}}, today a mathematician is likely to write Bernoulli's formula as:

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n k^c = \frac{n^{c+1}}{c+1}+\frac 1 2 n^c+\sum_{k=2}^c \frac{B_k}{k!} c^{\underline{k-1}}n^{c-k+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula suggests setting {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}} when switching from the so-called 'archaic' enumeration which uses only the even indices 2, 4, 6… to the modern form (more on different conventions in the next paragraph). Most striking in this context is the fact that the [[falling factorial]] {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;{{underline|''k''−1}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} has for {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}} the value {{math|{{sfrac|1|''c'' + 1}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Thus Bernoulli's formula can be written
: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n k^c = \sum_{k=0}^c \frac{B_k}{k!}c^{\underline{k-1}} n^{c-k+1}&lt;/math&gt;

if {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1/2}}, recapturing the value Bernoulli gave to the coefficient at that position.

Note that the formula for &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{k=1}^n k^9&lt;/math&gt; in the first half contains an error at the last term: it must be &lt;math&gt;-\tfrac {3}{20}n^2&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;-\tfrac {1}{12}n^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Many characterizations of the Bernoulli numbers have been found in the last 300 years, and each could be used to introduce these numbers.  Here only three of the most useful ones are mentioned:

* a recursive equation,
* an explicit formula,
* a generating function.

For the proof of the [[Logical equivalence|equivalence]] of the three approaches see {{Harv|Ireland|Rosen|1990}} or {{Harv|Conway|Guy|1996}}.

=== Recursive definition ===

The Bernoulli numbers obey the sum formulas &lt;ref name="MW1"/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \sum_{k=0}^{m}\binom {m+1} k B^{-{}}_k &amp;= \delta_{m, 0} \\ \sum_{k=0}^{m}\binom {m+1} k B^{+{}}_k &amp;= m+1 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m=0,1,2...&lt;/math&gt; and {{math|''δ''}} denotes the [[Kronecker delta]]. Solving for &lt;math&gt;B^{\mp{}}_m&lt;/math&gt; gives the recursive formulas
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  B_m^{-{}} &amp;= \delta_{m, 0} - \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \binom{m}{k} \frac{B^{-{}}_k}{m - k + 1} \\
  B_m^+ &amp;= 1 - \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \binom{m}{k} \frac{B^+_k}{m - k + 1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Explicit definition ===

In 1893 [[Louis Saalschütz]] listed  a total of 38 explicit formulas for the Bernoulli numbers {{Harv|Saalschütz|1893}}, usually giving some reference in the older literature. One of them is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  B^{-{}}_m &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^m \sum_{v=0}^k (-1)^v \binom{k}{v} \frac{v^m}{k + 1} \\
  B^+_m &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^m \sum_{v=0}^k (-1)^v \binom{k}{v} \frac{(v + 1)^m}{k + 1}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Generating function ===

The exponential [[generating function]]s are
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{t}{e^t - 1}    &amp;= \frac{t}{2} \left( \operatorname{coth} \frac{t}{2} -1 \right) &amp;= \sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{B^{-{}}_m t^m}{m!}\\
  \frac{t}{1 - e^{-t}} &amp;= \frac{t}{2} \left( \operatorname{coth} \frac{t}{2} +1 \right) &amp;= \sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{B^+_m t^m}{m!}. 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The (normal) generating function
: &lt;math&gt; z^{-1} \psi_1(z^{-1}) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} B^+_m z^m&lt;/math&gt;

is an [[asymptotic series]]. It contains the [[trigamma function]] {{math|''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

== Bernoulli numbers and the Riemann zeta function ==

[[File:BernoulliNumbersByZetaLowRes.png|thumb|right|The Bernoulli numbers as given by the Riemann zeta function.]]

The Bernoulli numbers can be expressed in terms of the [[Riemann zeta function]]:

:{{math|1=''B''{{su|p=+|b=''n''}} = −''nζ''(1 − ''n'')}} for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}.

Here the argument of the zeta function is 0 or negative.

By means of the zeta [[Riemann zeta function#The functional equation|functional equation]] and the gamma [[Gamma function#General|reflection formula]] the following relation can be obtained:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arfken |first=George |date=1970 |title=Mathematical methods for physicists (2nd edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |page=279 |isbn=978-0120598519 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; B_{2n} = \frac {(-1)^{n+1}2(2n)!} {(2\pi)^{2n}} \zeta(2n) &lt;/math&gt; for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}.

Now the argument of the zeta function is positive.

It then follows from {{math|''&amp;zeta;'' &amp;rarr; 1}} ({{math|''n'' &amp;rarr; &amp;infin;}}) and [[Stirling formula|Stirling's formula]] that
: &lt;math&gt; |B_{2 n}| \sim 4 \sqrt{\pi n} \left(\frac{n}{ \pi e} \right)^{2n} &lt;/math&gt; for {{math|''n'' &amp;rarr; &amp;infin;}}.

== Efficient computation of Bernoulli numbers ==

In some applications it is useful to be able to compute the Bernoulli numbers {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} through {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''p'' − 3&lt;/sub&gt;}} modulo {{mvar|p}}, where {{mvar|p}} is a prime; for example to test whether [[Vandiver's conjecture]] holds for {{mvar|p}}, or even just to determine whether {{mvar|p}} is an [[irregular prime]]. It is not feasible to carry out such a computation using the above recursive formulae, since at least (a constant multiple of) {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} arithmetic operations would be required. Fortunately, faster methods have been developed {{harv|Buhler|Crandall|Ernvall|Metsankyla|2001}} which require only {{math|''O''(''p'' (log ''p'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} operations (see [[big-O notation|big {{mvar|O}} notation]]).

David Harvey {{harv|Harvey|2008}} describes an algorithm for computing Bernoulli numbers by computing {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} modulo {{mvar|p}} for many small primes {{mvar|p}}, and then reconstructing {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} via the [[Chinese remainder theorem]]. Harvey writes that the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] [[Computational complexity theory|time complexity]] of this algorithm is {{math|''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; log(''n'')&lt;sup&gt;2 + ''ε''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and claims that this [[implementation]] is significantly faster than implementations based on other methods. Using this implementation Harvey computed {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Harvey's implementation has been included in [[SageMath]] since version 3.1. Prior to that, Bernd Kellner {{harv|Kellner|2002}}&lt;!--A more specific citation would be preferable.--&gt; computed {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to full precision for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;}} in December 2002 and Oleksandr Pavlyk {{harv|Pavlyk|2008}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;}} with [[Mathematica]] in April 2008.

== Applications of the Bernoulli numbers ==

=== Asymptotic analysis ===
Arguably the most important application of the Bernoulli number in mathematics is their use in the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula]]. Assuming that {{mvar|f}} is a sufficiently often differentiable function the Euler–Maclaurin formula can be written as &lt;ref&gt;''Concrete Mathematics'', (9.67).&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=a}^{b-1} f(k) = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx + \sum_{k=1}^m \frac{B^-_k}{k!} (f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a))+R_-(f,m).&lt;/math&gt;

This formulation assumes the convention {{math|1=''B''{{su|p=−|b=1}} = −{{sfrac|1|2}}}}. Using the convention {{math|1=''B''{{su|p=+|b=1}} = +{{sfrac|1|2}}}} the formula becomes

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=a+1}^{b} f(k) = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx + \sum_{k=1}^m \frac{B^+_k}{k!} (f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a))+R_+(f,m).&lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|1=''f''&lt;sup&gt;(0)&lt;/sup&gt; = ''f''}} (i.e. the zeroth-order derivative of a {{math|''f''}} is just {{math|''f''}}). Moreover, let {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;(−1)&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote an [[antiderivative]] of {{math|''f''}}. By the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]],

: &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = f^{(-1)}(b) - f^{(-1)}(a).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the last formula can be further simplified to the following succinct form of the Euler–Maclaurin formula

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=a}^{b}f(k)= \sum_{k=0}^m \frac{B_k}{k!} (f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a))+R(f,m). &lt;/math&gt;

This form is for example the source for the important Euler–Maclaurin expansion of the zeta function

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
  \zeta(s) &amp; =\sum_{k=0}^m \frac{B^+_k}{k!} s^{\overline{k-1}} + R(s,m) \\
           &amp; = \frac{B_0}{0!}s^{\overline{-1}} + \frac{B^+_1}{1!} s^{\overline{0}} + \frac{B_2}{2!} s^{\overline{1}} +\cdots+R(s,m) \\
           &amp; = \frac{1}{s-1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{12}s + \cdots + R(s,m).
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|''s''&lt;sup&gt;{{overline|''k''}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} denotes the [[Pochhammer symbol|rising factorial power]].&lt;ref&gt;''Concrete Mathematics'', (2.44) and (2.52)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernoulli numbers are also frequently used in other kinds of [[asymptotic expansion]]s. The following example is the classical Poincaré-type asymptotic expansion of the [[digamma function]] {{math|''ψ''}}.

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(z) \sim \ln z - \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{B^+_k}{k z^k} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Sum of powers ===

{{main article|Faulhaber's formula}}

Bernoulli numbers feature prominently in the [[Closed-form expression|closed form]] expression of the sum of the {{math|''m''}}th powers of the first {{math|''n''}} positive integers. For {{math|''m'', ''n'' ≥ 0}} define

:&lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n k^m = 1^m + 2^m + \cdots + n^m. &lt;/math&gt;

This expression can always be rewritten as a [[polynomial]] in {{math|''n''}} of degree {{math|''m'' + 1}}. The [[coefficient]]s of these polynomials are related to the Bernoulli numbers by '''Bernoulli's formula''':
: &lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = \frac{1}{m + 1} \sum_{k=0}^m \binom{m + 1}{k} B^+_k n^{m + 1 - k},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''m'' + 1|b=''k''|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} denotes the [[binomial coefficient]].

For example, taking {{math|''m''}} to be 1 gives the [[triangular number]]s {{math|0, 1, 3, 6, …}} {{OEIS2C|id=A000217}}.

:&lt;math&gt; 1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{1}{2} (B_0 n^2 + 2 B^+_1 n^1) = \tfrac12 (n^2 + n).&lt;/math&gt;

Taking {{math|''m''}} to be 2 gives the [[square pyramidal number]]s {{math|0, 1, 5, 14, …}} {{OEIS2C|id=A000330}}.

: &lt;math&gt;1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 = \frac{1}{3} (B_0 n^3 + 3 B^+_1 n^2 + 3 B_2 n^1) = \tfrac13 \left(n^3 + \tfrac32 n^2 + \tfrac12 n\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Some authors use the alternate convention for Bernoulli numbers and state Bernoulli's formula in this way:
: &lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = \frac{1}{m + 1} \sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \binom{m + 1}{k} B^{-{}}_k n^{m + 1 - k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Bernoulli's formula is sometimes called [[Faulhaber's formula]] after [[Johann Faulhaber]] who also found remarkable ways to calculate [[sums of powers]].

Faulhaber's formula was generalized by V. Guo and J. Zeng to a [[q-analog|{{mvar|q}}-analog]] {{harv|Guo|Zeng|2005}}.

===Taylor series===
The Bernoulli numbers appear in the [[Taylor series]] expansion of many [[trigonometric functions]] and [[hyperbolic function]]s.

;[[Tangent function|Tangent]]
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\tan x &amp;= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n-1} 2^{2n} (2^{2n}-1) B_{2n} }{(2n)!}\; x^{2n-1},&amp; \left |x \right | &amp;&lt; \frac \pi 2 \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
 
;[[Cotangent]]
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\cot x &amp; {} = \frac{1}{x} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n B_{2n} (2x)^{2n}}{(2n)!},&amp;  \qquad 0 &lt; |x| &lt; \pi.
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

;[[Hyperbolic tangent]]
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tanh x &amp;= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{2^{2n}(2^{2n}-1)B_{2n}}{(2n)!}\;x^{2n-1},&amp; |x| &amp;&lt; \frac \pi 2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Hyperbolic cotangent]]
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\coth x &amp; {} = \frac{1}{x} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{B_{2n} (2x)^{2n}}{(2n)!},&amp;  \qquad \qquad 0 &lt; |x| &lt; \pi.
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

===Laurent series===
The Bernoulli numbers appear in the following [[Laurent series]]:

[[Digamma function]]: &lt;math&gt; \psi(z)= \ln z- \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac {B_k^{+{}}} {k z^k} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arfken |first=George |date=1970 |title=Mathematical methods for physicists (2nd edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |page=463 |isbn=978-0120598519 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use in topology ===

The [[Kervaire–Milnor's formula]] for the order of the cyclic group of diffeomorphism classes of [[exotic sphere|exotic {{math|(4''n'' − 1)}}-spheres]] which bound [[parallelizable manifold]]s involves Bernoulli numbers. Let {{math|''ES''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the number of such exotic spheres for {{Math|''n'' ≥ 2}}, then

:&lt;math&gt;\textit{ES}_n = (2^{2n-2}-2^{4n-3}) \operatorname{Numerator}\left(\frac{B_{4n}}{4n} \right) .&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Hirzebruch signature theorem#L genus and the Hirzebruch signature theorem|Hirzebruch signature theorem]] for the [[Hirzebruch signature theorem#L genus and the Hirzebruch signature theorem|{{mvar|L}} genus]] of a [[Smooth manifold|smooth]] [[Orientability|oriented]] [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] 4''n'' also involves Bernoulli numbers.

== Connections with combinatorial numbers ==

The connection of the Bernoulli number to various kinds of combinatorial numbers is based on the classical theory of finite differences and on the combinatorial interpretation of the Bernoulli numbers as an instance of a fundamental combinatorial principle, the [[inclusion–exclusion principle]].

=== Connection with Worpitzky numbers ===

The definition to proceed with was developed by Julius Worpitzky in 1883. Besides elementary arithmetic only the factorial function {{math|''n''!}} and the power function {{math|''k&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is employed. The signless Worpitzky numbers are defined as

: &lt;math&gt; W_{n,k}=\sum_{v=0}^k (-1)^{v+k} (v+1)^n \frac{k!}{v!(k-v)!} . &lt;/math&gt;

They can also be expressed through the [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]]

: &lt;math&gt; W_{n,k}=k! \left\{ {n+1\atop k+1} \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

A Bernoulli number is then introduced as an inclusion–exclusion sum of Worpitzky numbers weighted by the [[Harmonic progression (mathematics)|harmonic sequence]] 1,&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}},&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}},&amp;nbsp;…

: &lt;math&gt; B_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \frac{W_{n,k}}{k+1}\ =\ \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{k+1} \sum_{v=0}^k (-1)^v (v+1)^n {k \choose v}\ . &lt;/math&gt;

:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|1|2}}}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|3|2}} + {{sfrac|2|3}}}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|7|2}} + {{sfrac|12|3}} − {{sfrac|6|4}}}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|15|2}} + {{sfrac|50|3}} − {{sfrac|60|4}} + {{sfrac|24|5}}}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|31|2}} + {{sfrac|180|3}} − {{sfrac|390|4}} + {{sfrac|360|5}} − {{sfrac|120|6}}}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|63|2}} + {{sfrac|602|3}} − {{sfrac|2100|4}} + {{sfrac|3360|5}} − {{sfrac|2520|6}} + {{sfrac|720|7}}}}

This representation has {{math|''B''{{su|p=+|b=1}} {{=}} +{{sfrac|1|2}}}}.

Consider the sequence {{math|''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}}. From Worpitzky's numbers {{OEIS2C|id=A028246}}, {{OEIS2C|id=A163626}} applied to {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, …}} is identical to the Akiyama–Tanigawa transform applied to {{math|''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (see [[Bernoulli number#Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind|Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind]]). This can be seen via the table:

:{| style="text-align:center"
|+ '''Identity of Worpitzky's representation and Akiyama–Tanigawa transform'''

The first row represents {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Hence for the second fractional Euler numbers {{OEIS2C|id=A198631}} ({{math|''n''}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A006519}} ({{math|''n'' + 1}}):

:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|1|2}}}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|3|2}} + {{sfrac|2|4}}}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|7|2}} + {{sfrac|12|4}} − {{sfrac|6|8}}}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|15|2}} + {{sfrac|50|4}} − {{sfrac|60|8}} + {{sfrac|24|16}}}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|31|2}} + {{sfrac|180|4}} − {{sfrac|390|8}} + {{sfrac|360|16}} − {{sfrac|120|32}}}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|63|2}} + {{sfrac|602|4}} − {{sfrac|2100|8}} + {{sfrac|3360|16}} − {{sfrac|2520|32}} + {{sfrac|720|64}}}}

A second formula representing the Bernoulli numbers by the Worpitzky numbers is for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}

: &lt;math&gt; B_n=\frac n {2^{n+1}-2}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-2)^{-k}\, W_{n-1,k} . &lt;/math&gt;

The simplified second Worpitzky's representation of the second Bernoulli numbers is:

{{OEIS2C|id=A164555}} ({{math|''n'' + 1}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}({{math|''n'' + 1}}) = {{math|{{sfrac|''n'' + 1|2&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2}}}} × {{OEIS2C|id=A198631}}({{math|''n''}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A006519}}({{math|''n'' + 1}})

which links the second Bernoulli numbers to the second fractional Euler numbers. The beginning is:

:{{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}, {{sfrac|1|6}}, 0, −{{sfrac|1|30}}, 0, {{sfrac|1|42}}, … {{=}} ({{sfrac|1|2}}, {{sfrac|1|3}}, {{sfrac|3|14}}, {{sfrac|2|15}}, {{sfrac|5|62}}, {{sfrac|1|21}}, …) × (1, {{sfrac|1|2}}, 0, −{{sfrac|1|4}}, 0, {{sfrac|1|2}}, …)}}

The numerators of the first parentheses are {{OEIS2C|id=A111701}} (see [[Bernoulli number#Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind|Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind]]).

=== Connection with Stirling numbers of the second kind ===

If {{math|''S''(''k'',''m'')}} denotes [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]]&lt;ref&gt;L. Comtet, Advanced combinatorics. The art of finite and infinite expansions, Revised and Enlarged Edition, D. Reidel Publ. Co., Dordrecht-Boston, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; then one has:

: &lt;math&gt;j^k=\sum_{m=0}^k {j^{\underline{m}}} S(k,m)&lt;/math&gt;
                                                              
where {{math|''j''&lt;sup&gt;{{underline|''m''}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} denotes the [[Pochhammer symbol|falling factorial]].

If one defines the [[Bernoulli polynomials]] {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''j'')}} as:&lt;ref name="H. Rademacher, Analytic Number Theory 1973"&gt;H. Rademacher, Analytic Number Theory, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; B_k(j)=k\sum_{m=0}^{k-1}\binom{j}{m+1}S(k-1,m)m!+B_k &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2,…}} are the Bernoulli numbers.

Then after the following property of [[binomial coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \binom{j}{m}=\binom{j+1}{m+1}-\binom{j}{m+1} &lt;/math&gt;
 
one has,

:&lt;math&gt; j^k=\frac{B_{k+1}(j+1)-B_{k+1}(j)}{k+1}. &lt;/math&gt;

One also has following for Bernoulli polynomials,&lt;ref name="H. Rademacher, Analytic Number Theory 1973"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  B_k(j)=\sum_{n=0}^k \binom{k}{n} B_n j^{k-n}. &lt;/math&gt;

The coefficient of {{mvar|j}} in {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''j''|b=''m'' + 1|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} is {{math|{{sfrac|(−1)&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;|''m'' + 1}}}}.

Comparing the coefficient of {{mvar|j}} in the two expressions of Bernoulli polynomials, one has:

: &lt;math&gt; B_k=\sum_{m=0}^k (-1)^m \frac{m!}{m+1} S(k,m)&lt;/math&gt;

(resulting in {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} +{{sfrac|1|2}}}}) which is an explicit formula for Bernoulli numbers and can be used to prove [[Von Staudt–Clausen theorem|Von-Staudt Clausen theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=H. W. Gould |title=Explicit formulas for Bernoulli numbers |journal=Amer. Math. Monthly |volume=79 |year=1972 |pages=44–51 |doi=10.2307/2978125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=T. M. Apostol |title=Introduction to Analytic Number Theory |publisher=Springer-Verlag |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=G. Boole |title=A treatise of the calculus of finite differences |edition=3rd |place=London |year=1880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind ===

The two main formulas relating the unsigned [[Stirling numbers of the first kind]] {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;[&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''n''|b=''m''|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} to the Bernoulli numbers (with {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} +{{sfrac|1|2}}}}) are

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{m!}\sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^{k} \left[{m+1\atop k+1}\right] B_k = \frac{1}{m+1}, &lt;/math&gt;

and the inversion of this sum (for {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}}, {{math|''m'' ≥ 0}})

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{m!}\sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \left[{m+1\atop k+1}\right] B_{n+k} = A_{n,m}. &lt;/math&gt;

Here the number {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the rational Akiyama–Tanigawa numbers, the first few of which are displayed in the following table.

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align=center"

The Akiyama–Tanigawa numbers satisfy a simple recurrence relation which can be exploited to iteratively compute the Bernoulli numbers. This leads to the algorithm shown in the section 'algorithmic description' above. See {{OEIS2C|id=A051714}}/{{OEIS2C|id=A051715}}.

An ''autosequence'' is a sequence which has its inverse binomial transform equal to the signed sequence. If the main diagonal is zeroes = {{OEIS2C|id=A000004}}, the autosequence is of the first kind. Example: {{OEIS2C|id=A000045}}, the Fibonacci numbers. If the main diagonal is the first upper diagonal multiplied by 2, it is of the second kind. Example: {{OEIS2C|id=A164555}}/{{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}, the second Bernoulli numbers (see {{OEIS2C|id=A190339}}). The Akiyama–Tanigawa transform applied to {{math|''2''&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} = 1/{{OEIS2C|id=A000079}} leads to {{OEIS2C|id=A198631}} (''n'') / {{OEIS2C|id=A06519}} (''n'' + 1). Hence:

===Connection with Pascal’s triangle===

There are formulas connecting Pascal's triangle to Bernoulli numbers &lt;ref&gt;this formula was discovered (or perhaps rediscovered) by Giorgio Pietrocola. His demonstration is available in Italian language: {{cite web |url=http://www.maecla.it/Matematica/sommapotenze/teorema_1B.htm#teorema1b |title=Esplorando un antico sentiero: teoremi sulla somma di potenze di interi successivi (Corollario 2b)|last=Pietrocola |first=Giorgio |date=October 31, 2008 |website=Maecla |access-date=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; B^{+}_n=\frac{|A_n|}{(n+1)!}~~~&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;|A_n|&lt;/math&gt; is the determinant of a n-by-n square matrix part of Pascal’s triangle whose elements are: &lt;math&gt;
a_{i, k} = \begin{cases} 
0 &amp; \text{if } k&gt;1+i \\
{i+1 \choose k-1} &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Example:

:&lt;math&gt; B^{+}_6 =\frac{\det\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp; 2&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 3&amp; 3&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 4&amp; 6&amp; 4&amp; 0&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 5&amp; 10&amp; 10&amp; 5&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 6&amp; 15&amp; 20&amp; 15&amp; 6\\
1&amp; 7&amp; 21&amp; 35&amp; 35&amp; 21
\end{pmatrix}}{7!}=\frac{120}{5040}=\frac 1 {42}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Connection with Eulerian numbers ===

There are formulas connecting [[Eulerian number]]s {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;⟨&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''n''|b=''m''|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;⟩&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} to Bernoulli numbers:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \left \langle {n\atop m} \right \rangle &amp;= 2^{n+1} (2^{n+1}-1) \frac{B_{n+1}}{n+1}, \\
\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \left \langle {n\atop m} \right \rangle \binom{n}{m}^{-1} &amp;= (n+1) B_n.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Both formulae are valid for {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}} if {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is set to {{sfrac|1|2}}. If {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is set to −{{sfrac|1|2}} they are valid only for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}} and {{math|''n'' ≥ 2}} respectively.

==A binary tree representation==
The Stirling polynomials {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} are related to the Bernoulli numbers by {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''n''!''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1)}}. S. C. Woon {{harv|Woon|1997}} described an algorithm to compute {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1)}} as a binary tree:

:[[File:SCWoonTree.png]]

Woon's recursive algorithm (for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}) starts by assigning to the root node {{math|''N'' {{=}} [1,2]}}. Given a node {{math|''N'' {{=}} [''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} of the tree, the left child of the node is {{math|''L''(''N'') {{=}} [−''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} and the right child {{math|''R''(''N'') {{=}} [''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 2, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]}}. A node {{math|''N'' {{=}} [''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} is written as {{math|±[''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} in the initial part of the tree represented above with ± denoting the sign of {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Given a node {{mvar|N}} the factorial of {{mvar|N}} is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; N! = a_1 \prod_{k=2}^{\operatorname{length}(N)} a_k!. &lt;/math&gt;

Restricted to the nodes {{mvar|N}} of a fixed tree-level {{mvar|n}} the sum of {{math|{{sfrac|1|''N''!}}}} is {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1)}}, thus

:&lt;math&gt; B_n = \sum_\stackrel{N \text{ node of}}{\text{ tree-level } n} \frac{n!}{N!}. &lt;/math&gt;

For example:
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1!({{sfrac|1|2!}})}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2!(−{{sfrac|1|3!}} + {{sfrac|1|2!2!}})}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 3!({{sfrac|1|4!}} − {{sfrac|1|2!3!}} − {{sfrac|1|3!2!}} + {{sfrac|1|2!2!2!}})}}

==Integral representation and continuation==

The [[integral]]
: &lt;math&gt; b(s) = 2e^{s i \pi/2}\int_0^\infty \frac{st^s}{1-e^{2\pi t}} \frac{dt}{t} &lt;/math&gt;
has as special values {{math|''b''(2''n'') {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}.

For example, {{math|1=''b''(3) = {{sfrac|3|2}}''ζ''(3)''&amp;pi;''&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;''i''}} and {{math|1=''b''(5) = −{{sfrac|15|2}}''ζ''(5)''&amp;pi;''&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;''i''}}. Here, {{mvar|ζ}} is the [[Riemann zeta function]], and {{mvar|i}} is the [[imaginary unit]]. Leonhard Euler (''Opera Omnia'', Ser. 1, Vol. 10, p.&amp;nbsp;351) considered these numbers and calculated

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
  p &amp;=  \frac{3}{2\pi^3}\left(1+\frac{1}{2^3}+\frac{1}{3^3}+\cdots \right) = 0.0581522\ldots \\
  q &amp;= \frac{15}{2\pi^5}\left(1+\frac{1}{2^5}+\frac{1}{3^5}+\cdots \right) = 0.0254132\ldots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==The relation to the Euler numbers and {{pi}}==

The [[Euler number]]s are a sequence of integers intimately connected with the Bernoulli numbers. Comparing the
asymptotic expansions of the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers shows that the Euler numbers {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are in magnitude approximately {{math|{{sfrac|2|π}}(4&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 2&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} times larger than the Bernoulli numbers {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In consequence:

: &lt;math&gt; \pi \sim 2 (2^{2n} - 4^{2n}) \frac{B_{2n}}{E_{2n}}. &lt;/math&gt;

This asymptotic equation reveals that {{pi}} lies in the common root of both the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers. In fact {{pi}} could be computed from these rational approximations.

Bernoulli numbers can be expressed through the Euler numbers and vice versa. Since, for odd {{mvar|n}}, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} (with the exception {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}), it suffices to consider the case when {{mvar|n}} is even.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 B_{n} &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\binom{n-1}{k} \frac{n}{4^n-2^n}E_k &amp; n&amp;=2, 4, 6, \ldots \\
 E_{n} &amp;= \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k-1} \frac{2^k-4^k}{k} B_k &amp; n&amp;=2,4,6,\ldots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These conversion formulas express an [[inverse relation]] between the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers. But more important, there is a deep arithmetic root common to both kinds of numbers, which can be expressed through a more fundamental sequence of numbers, also closely tied to {{pi}}. These numbers are defined for {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}} as

:&lt;math&gt; S_n = 2 \left(\frac{2}{\pi}\right)^n \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty (4k+1)^{-n} \qquad k=0,-1,1,-2,2,\ldots &lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1}} by convention {{harv|Elkies|2003}}. The magic of these numbers lies in the fact that they turn out to be rational numbers.  This was first proved by [[Leonhard Euler]] in a landmark paper {{harv|Euler|1735}} ''‘De summis serierum reciprocarum’'' (On the sums of series of reciprocals) and has fascinated mathematicians ever since. The first few of these numbers are

: &lt;math&gt; S_n = 1,1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\frac{5}{24}, \frac{2}{15},\frac{61}{720},\frac{17}{315},\frac{277}{8064},\frac{62}{2835},\ldots  &lt;/math&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id=A099612}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A099617}})

These are the coefficients in the expansion of {{math|sec ''x'' + tan ''x''}}.

The Bernoulli numbers and Euler numbers are best understood as ''special views'' of these numbers, selected from the sequence {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and scaled for use in special applications.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  B_{n} &amp;= (-1)^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor} [ n \text{ even}] \frac{n! }{2^n - 4^n}\, S_{n}\ , &amp; n&amp;= 2, 3, \ldots \\
  E_n &amp;= (-1)^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor} [ n \text{ even}] n! \, S_{n+1}  &amp; n &amp;= 0, 1, \ldots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The expression [{{math|''n''}} even] has the value 1 if {{math|''n''}} is even and 0 otherwise ([[Iverson bracket]]).

These identities show that the quotient of Bernoulli and Euler numbers at the beginning of this section is just the special case of {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|2''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} when {{mvar|n}} is even. The {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are rational approximations to {{pi}} and two successive terms always enclose the true value of {{pi}}. Beginning with {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}} the sequence starts ({{OEIS2C|id=A132049}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A132050}}):

: &lt;math&gt; 2, 4, 3, \frac{16}{5}, \frac{25}{8}, \frac{192}{61}, \frac{427}{136}, \frac{4352}{1385}, \frac{12465}{3968}, \frac{158720}{50521},\ldots \quad \longrightarrow \pi. &lt;/math&gt;

These rational numbers also appear in the last paragraph of Euler's paper cited above.

Consider the Akiyama–Tanigawa transform for the sequence {{OEIS2C|id=A046978}} ({{math|''n'' + 2}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A016116}} ({{math|''n'' + 1}}):

:{| class="wikitable"
! 0 
|1||{{sfrac|1|2}}||0||−{{sfrac|1|4}}||−{{sfrac|1|4}}||−{{sfrac|1|8}}||0
|-
! 1 
| {{sfrac|1|2}}|| 1|| {{sfrac|3|4}}|| 0|| −{{sfrac|5|8}}|| −{{sfrac|3|4}}||
|-
! 2 
| −{{sfrac|1|2}}|| {{sfrac|1|2}}|| {{sfrac|9|4}}|| {{sfrac|5|2}}|| {{sfrac|5|8}}|| ||
|-

| −1|| −{{sfrac|7|2}}|| −{{sfrac|3|4}}|| {{sfrac|15|2}}|| || ||
|-

|-
! 5 
| 8|| {{sfrac|77|2}}|| || || || ||
|-
! 6 
| −{{sfrac|61|2}}|| || || || || ||
|}

From the second, the numerators of the first column are the denominators of Euler's formula. The first column is −{{sfrac|1|2}} × {{OEIS2C|id=A163982}}.

==An algorithmic view: the Seidel triangle==

The sequence ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has another unexpected yet important property: The denominators of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; divide the factorial (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;. In other words: the numbers ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)!, sometimes called [[Alternating permutations|Euler zigzag numbers]], are integers.

: &lt;math&gt; T_n = 1,\,1,\,1,\,2,\,5,\,16,\,61,\,272,\,1385,\,7936,\,50521,\,353792,\ldots \quad n=0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots &lt;/math&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id=A000111}}). See ({{OEIS2C|id=A253671}}).

Thus the above representations of the Bernoulli and Euler numbers can be rewritten in terms of this sequence as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 B_n &amp;= (-1)^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor} [n\text{ even}] \frac{n }{2^n-4^n}\, T_{n-1}\  &amp; n &amp;= 2, 3, \ldots \\
 E_n &amp;= (-1)^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor} [n\text{ even}] T_{n+1} &amp; n &amp;= 0, 1, \ldots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These identities make it easy to compute the Bernoulli and Euler numbers: the Euler numbers {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are given immediately by {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;2''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the Bernoulli numbers {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are obtained from {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} by some easy shifting, avoiding rational arithmetic.

What remains is to find a convenient way to compute the numbers {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. However, already in 1877 [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel]] {{harv|Seidel|1877}} published an ingenious algorithm which makes it extremely simple to calculate {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

:[[File:SeidelAlgorithmForTn.png|frame|none|Seidel's algorithm for {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}]]

#Start by putting 1 in row 0 and let {{math|''k''}} denote the number of the row currently being filled
#If {{math|''k''}} is odd, then put the number on the left end of the row {{math|''k'' − 1}} in the first position of the row {{math|''k''}}, and fill the row from the left to the right, with every entry being the sum of the number to the left and the number to the upper
#At the end of the row duplicate the last number.
#If {{math|''k''}} is even, proceed similar in the other direction.

Seidel's algorithm is in fact much more general (see the exposition of Dominique Dumont {{harv|Dumont|1981}}) and was rediscovered several times thereafter.

Similar to Seidel's approach D. E. Knuth and T. J. Buckholtz {{harv|Knuth|Buckholtz|1967}} gave a recurrence equation for the numbers {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and recommended this method for computing {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} ‘on electronic computers using only simple operations on integers’.

V. I. Arnold rediscovered Seidel's algorithm in {{harv|Arnold|1991}} and later Millar, Sloane and Young popularized Seidel's algorithm under the name [[boustrophedon transform]].

==A combinatorial view: alternating permutations==
{{main article|Alternating permutations}}

Around 1880, three years after the publication of Seidel's algorithm, [[Désiré André]] proved a now classic result of combinatorial analysis {{harv|André|1879}} &amp; {{harv|André|1881}}. Looking at the first terms of the Taylor expansion of the [[trigonometric functions]]
{{math|tan ''x''}} and {{math|sec ''x''}} André made a startling discovery.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \tan x &amp;= x + \frac{2x^3}{3!} + \frac{16x^5}{5!} + \frac{272x^7}{7!} + \frac{7936x^9}{9!} + \cdots\\[6pt]
 \sec x &amp;= 1 + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{5x^4}{4!} + \frac{61x^6}{6!} + \frac{1385x^8}{8!} + \frac{50521x^{10}}{10!} + \cdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients are the [[Euler number]]s of odd and even index, respectively. In consequence the ordinary expansion of {{math|tan ''x'' + sec ''x''}} has as coefficients the rational numbers {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

: &lt;math&gt; \tan x + \sec x = 1 + x + \tfrac{1}{2}x^2 + \tfrac{1}{3}x^3 + \tfrac{5}{24}x^4 + \tfrac{2}{15}x^5 + \tfrac{61}{720}x^6 + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

André then succeeded by means of a recurrence argument to show that the [[alternating permutation]]s of odd size are enumerated by the Euler numbers of odd index (also called tangent numbers) and the alternating permutations of even size by the Euler numbers of even index (also called secant numbers).

==Related sequences==

The arithmetic mean of the first and the second Bernoulli numbers are the associate Bernoulli numbers: 
{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}}, {{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}, {{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sfrac|1|6}}}}, {{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}, {{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = −{{sfrac|1|30}}}}, {{OEIS2C|id=A176327}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}. Via the second row of its inverse Akiyama–Tanigawa transform {{OEIS2C|id=A177427}}, they lead to Balmer series {{OEIS2C|id=A061037}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A061038}}.

The Akiyama–Tanigawa algorithm applied to {{OEIS2C|id=A060819}} ({{math|''n'' + 4}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A145979}} ({{mvar|n}}) leads to the Bernoulli numbers {{OEIS2C|id=A027641}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}, {{OEIS2C|id=A164555}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}, or {{OEIS2C|id=A176327}} {{OEIS2C|id=A176289}} without {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, named intrinsic Bernoulli numbers {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')}}.

Hence another link between the intrinsic Bernoulli numbers and the Balmer series via {{OEIS2C|id=A145979}} ({{math|''n''}}).

{{OEIS2C|id=A145979}} ({{math|''n'' − 2}}) = 0, 2, 1, 6,… is a permutation of the non-negative numbers.

The terms of the first row are f(n) = {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}} + {{sfrac|1|''n'' + 2}}}}. 2, f(n) is an autosequence of the second kind. 3/2, f(n) leads by its inverse binomial transform to 3/2 &amp;minus;1/2 1/3 &amp;minus;1/4 1/5 ... = 1/2 + log 2.

Consider g(n) = 1/2 - 1 / (n+2) = 0, 1/6, 1/4, 3/10, 1/3. The Akiyama-Tanagiwa transforms gives:

0, g(n), is an autosequence of the second kind.

Euler {{OEIS2C|id=A198631}} ({{math|''n''}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A006519}} ({{math|''n'' + 1}}) without the second term ({{sfrac|1|2}}) are the fractional intrinsic Euler numbers {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') {{=}} 1, 0, −{{sfrac|1|4}}, 0, {{sfrac|1|2}}, 0, −{{sfrac|17|8}}, 0, …}} The corresponding Akiyama transform is:

==Arithmetical properties of the Bernoulli numbers==

The Bernoulli numbers can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function as {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −''nζ''(1 − ''n'')}} for integers {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}} provided for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}} the expression {{math|−''nζ''(1 − ''n'')}} is understood as the limiting value and the convention {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}} is used. This intimately relates them to the values of the zeta function at negative integers. As such, they could be expected to have and do have deep arithmetical properties. For example, the [[Agoh–Giuga conjecture]] postulates that {{mvar|p}} is a prime number if and only if {{math|''pB''&lt;sub&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is congruent to −1 modulo {{mvar|p}}. Divisibility properties of the Bernoulli numbers are related to the [[ideal class group]]s of [[cyclotomic field]]s by a theorem of Kummer and its strengthening in the [[Herbrand-Ribet theorem]], and to class numbers of real quadratic fields by [[Ankeny–Artin–Chowla congruence|Ankeny–Artin–Chowla]].

=== The Kummer theorems ===

The Bernoulli numbers are related to [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] (FLT) by [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]]'s theorem {{harv|Kummer|1850}}, which says:

:If the odd prime {{mvar|p}} does not divide any of the numerators of the Bernoulli numbers {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''p'' − 3&lt;/sub&gt;}} then {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}} has no solutions in nonzero integers.

Prime numbers with this property are called [[regular prime]]s. Another classical result of Kummer {{harv|Kummer|1851}} are the following [[Modular arithmetic#Congruence relation|congruences]].

{{main article|Kummer's congruence}}

:Let {{mvar|p}} be an odd prime and {{mvar|b}} an even number such that {{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} does not divide {{mvar|b}}. Then for any non-negative integer {{mvar|k}}
:: &lt;math&gt; \frac{B_{k(p-1)+b}}{k(p-1)+b} \equiv \frac{B_{b}}{b} \pmod{p}. &lt;/math&gt;

A generalization of these congruences goes by the name of {{math|''p''}}-adic continuity.

==={{math|''p''}}-adic continuity===

If {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} are positive integers such that {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} are not divisible by {{math|''p'' − 1}} and {{math|''m'' ≡ ''n'' mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''b'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; (''p'' − 1)}}, then

:&lt;math&gt;(1-p^{m-1})\frac{B_m}{m} \equiv (1-p^{n-1})\frac{B_n} n \pmod{p^b}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −''nζ''(1 − ''n'')}}, this can also be written

:&lt;math&gt;\left(1-p^{-u}\right)\zeta(u) \equiv \left(1-p^{-v}\right)\zeta(v) \pmod{p^b},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''u'' {{=}} 1 − ''m''}} and {{math|''v'' {{=}} 1 − ''n''}}, so that {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are nonpositive and not congruent to 1 modulo {{math|''p'' − 1}}. This tells us that the Riemann zeta function, with {{math|1 − ''p''&lt;sup&gt;−''s''&lt;/sup&gt;}} taken out of the Euler product formula, is continuous in the [[p-adic number|{{mvar|p}}-adic number]]s on odd negative integers congruent modulo {{math|''p'' − 1}} to a particular {{math|''a'' ≢ 1 mod (''p'' − 1)}}, and so can be extended to a continuous function {{math|''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'')}} for all {{mvar|p}}-adic integers {{math|'''ℤ'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the [[p-adic zeta function|{{mvar|p}}-adic zeta function]].

=== Ramanujan's congruences ===

The following relations, due to [[Ramanujan]], provide a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers that is more efficient than the one given by their original recursive definition:

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{m+3}{m} B_m=\begin{cases}
\frac{m+3}{3}-\sum\limits_{j=1}^\frac{m}{6}\binom{m+3}{m-6j}B_{m-6j}, &amp; \text{if } m\equiv 0\pmod 6;\\
\frac{m+3}{3}-\sum\limits_{j=1}^\frac{m-2}{6}\binom{m+3}{m-6j}B_{m-6j}, &amp; \text{if } m\equiv 2\pmod 6;\\
-\frac{m+3}{6}-\sum\limits_{j=1}^\frac{m-4}{6}\binom{m+3}{m-6j}B_{m-6j}, &amp; \text{if } m\equiv 4\pmod 6.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Von Staudt–Clausen theorem ===

{{main article|Von Staudt–Clausen theorem}}

The von Staudt–Clausen theorem was given by [[Karl Georg Christian von Staudt]] {{harv|von Staudt|1840}} and [[Thomas Clausen (mathematician)|Thomas Clausen]] {{harv|Clausen|1840}} independently in 1840. The theorem states that for every {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}},
: &lt;math&gt; B_{2n} + \sum_{(p-1)\,\mid\,2n} \frac1p&lt;/math&gt;
is an integer. The sum extends over all [[prime number|primes]] {{math|''p''}} for which {{math|''p'' − 1}} divides {{math|2''n''}}.

A consequence of this is that the denominator of {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is given by the product of all primes {{math|''p''}} for which {{math|''p'' − 1}} divides {{math|2''n''}}. In particular, these denominators are [[square-free]] and divisible by&amp;nbsp;6.

=== Why do the odd Bernoulli numbers vanish? ===
The sum

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_k(n) = \sum_{i=0}^n i^k - \frac{n^k} 2&lt;/math&gt;

can be evaluated for negative values of the index {{math|''n''}}. Doing so will show that it is an [[odd function]] for even values of {{math|''k''}}, which implies that the  sum has only terms of odd index. This and the formula for the Bernoulli sum imply that {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''k'' + 1 − ''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is 0 for {{math|''m''}} even and {{math|2''k'' + 1 − ''m'' &gt; 1}}; and that the term for {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is cancelled by the subtraction.  The von Staudt–Clausen theorem combined with Worpitzky's representation also gives a combinatorial answer to this question (valid for ''n'' &gt; 1).

From the von Staudt–Clausen theorem it is known that for odd {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}} the number {{math|2''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an integer. This seems trivial if one knows beforehand that the integer in question is zero. However, by applying Worpitzky's representation one gets

: &lt;math&gt; 2B_n =\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \frac{2}{m+1}m! \left\{{n+1\atop m+1} \right\} = 0\quad(n&gt;1 \text{ is odd})&lt;/math&gt;

as a ''sum of integers'', which is not trivial. Here a combinatorial fact comes to surface which explains the vanishing of the Bernoulli numbers at odd index. Let {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the number of surjective maps from {{math|{1, 2, …, ''n''}|}} to {{math|{1, 2, …, ''m''}|}}, then {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''!&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;{&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''n''|b=''m''|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;}&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}}. The last equation can only hold if

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{\text{odd }m=1}^{n-1} \frac 2 {m^2}S_{n,m}=\sum_{\text{even } m=2}^n \frac{2}{m^2} S_{n,m} \quad (n&gt;2 \text{ is even}). &lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be proved by induction. The first two examples of this equation are

:{{math|1=''n'' = 4: 2 + 8 = 7 + 3}},
:{{math|1=''n'' = 6: 2 + 120 + 144 = 31 + 195 + 40}}.

Thus the Bernoulli numbers vanish at odd index because some non-obvious combinatorial identities are embodied in the Bernoulli numbers.

=== A restatement of the Riemann hypothesis ===

The connection between the Bernoulli numbers and the Riemann zeta function is strong enough to provide an alternate formulation of the [[Riemann hypothesis]] (RH) which uses only the Bernoulli number. In fact [[Marcel Riesz]] {{harv|Riesz|1916}} proved that the RH is equivalent to the following assertion:

:For every {{math|''ε'' &gt; {{sfrac|1|4}}}} there exists a constant {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;''ε''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0}} (depending on {{math|''ε''}}) such that {{math|{{abs|''R''(''x'')}} &lt; ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''ε''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ε''&lt;/sup&gt;}} as {{math|''x'' → ∞}}.

Here {{math|''R''(''x'')}} is the [[Riesz function]]

: &lt;math&gt; R(x) = 2 \sum_{k=1}^\infty
\frac{k^{\overline{k}} x^{k}}{(2\pi)^{2k}\left(\frac{B_{2k}}{2k}\right)}
= 2\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^{\overline{k}}x^k}{(2\pi)^{2k}\beta_{2k}}. &lt;/math&gt;

{{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;{{overline|''k''}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} denotes the [[Pochhammer symbol#Alternate notations|rising factorial power]] in the notation of [[D. E. Knuth]]. The numbers {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|''n''}}}} occur frequently in the study of the zeta function and are significant  because {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a {{math|''p''}}-integer for primes {{math|''p''}} where {{math|''p'' − 1}} does not divide {{math|''n''}}.  The {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are called ''divided Bernoulli numbers''.

==&lt;span id="Generalized Bernoulli numbers"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Generalized Bernoulli numbers==
The '''generalized Bernoulli numbers''' are certain [[algebraic number]]s, defined similarly to the Bernoulli numbers, that are related to [[Special values of L-functions|special values]] of [[Dirichlet L-function|Dirichlet {{mvar|L}}-functions]] in the same way that Bernoulli numbers are related to special values of the Riemann zeta function.

Let {{mvar|χ}} be a [[Dirichlet character]] modulo {{mvar|f}}. The generalized Bernoulli numbers attached to {{mvar|χ}} are defined by

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{a=1}^f \chi(a) \frac{te^{at}}{e^{ft}-1} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty B_{k,\chi}\frac{t^k}{k!}.&lt;/math&gt;

Apart from the exceptional {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1,1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}}, we have, for any Dirichlet character {{mvar|χ}}, that {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''χ''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} if {{math|''χ''(−1) ≠ (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Generalizing the relation between Bernoulli numbers and values of the Riemann zeta function at non-positive integers, one has the for all integers {{math|''k'' ≥ 1}}:

: &lt;math&gt;L(1-k,\chi)=-\frac{B_{k,\chi}}k,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''L''(''s'',''χ'')}} is the Dirichlet {{mvar|L}}-function of {{mvar|χ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neukirch|1999|loc=§VII.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further information|Eisenstein–Kronecker number}}

==Appendix==

=== Assorted identities ===
{{unordered list
|1 = [[Umbral calculus]] gives a compact form of Bernoulli's formula by using an abstract symbol {{math|'''B'''}}:

: &lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = \frac 1 {m+1} ((\mathbf{B} + n)^{m+1} - B_{m+1}) &lt;/math&gt;

where the symbol {{math|'''B'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} that appears during binomial expansion of the parenthesized term is to be replaced by the Bernoulli number {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (and {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} +{{sfrac|1|2}}}}). More suggestively and mnemonically, this may be written as a definite integral:

:&lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = \int_0^n (\mathbf{B}+x)^m\,dx &lt;/math&gt;

Many other Bernoulli identities can be written compactly with this symbol, e.g.

:&lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{B} + 1)^m  = B_m  &lt;/math&gt;

|2 = Let {{math|''n''}} be non-negative and even

:&lt;math&gt; \zeta(n) = \frac{(-1)^{\frac{n}{2} - 1} B_n (2\pi)^n}{2(n!)}&lt;/math&gt;

|3 = The {{math|''n''}}th [[cumulant]] of the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] [[probability distribution]] on the interval [−1,&amp;nbsp;0] is {{math|{{sfrac|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|''n''}}}}.

|4 = Let {{math|''n''? {{=}} {{sfrac|1|''n''!}}}} and {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}. Then {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the following {{math|(''n'' + 1) × (''n'' + 1)}} determinant:&lt;ref name="Malenfant 2011" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
B_n &amp; = n! \begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
2? &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
n? &amp; (n-1)? &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
(n+1)? &amp; n? &amp; \cdots &amp; 2? &amp; 0
\end{vmatrix} \\[8pt]
&amp; = n! \begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\frac{1}{2!} &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
\frac{1}{n!} &amp; \frac{1}{(n-1)!} &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
\frac{1}{(n+1)!} &amp; \frac{1}{n!} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{1}{2!} &amp; 0
\end{vmatrix}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the determinant is {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1)}}, the [[Stirling polynomial]] at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}}.

|5 = For even-numbered Bernoulli numbers, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is given by the {{math|(''p'' + 1) × (''p'' + 1)}} determinant:&lt;ref name="Malenfant 2011"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1103.1585 |author1=Jerome Malenfant |title=Finite, closed-form expressions for the partition function and for Euler, Bernoulli, and Stirling numbers |class=math.NT |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; B_{2p} = -\frac{(2p)!}{2^{2p} - 2} \begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\frac{1}{3!} &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\frac{1}{5!} &amp; \frac{1}{3!} &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots&amp; \vdots \\
\frac{1}{(2p+1)!} &amp; \frac{1}{(2p-1)!} &amp; \frac{1}{(2p-3)!} &amp;\cdots &amp; \frac{1}{3!} &amp; 0
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

|6 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}. Then ([[Leonhard Euler]])

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}B_k B_{n-k}+B_{n-1}=-B_n &lt;/math&gt;

|7 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}.  Then {{harv|von Ettingshausen|1827}}

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n+1}k (n+k+1)B_{n+k}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

|8 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}}.  Then ([[Leopold Kronecker]] 1883)

: &lt;math&gt; B_n = - \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} \frac{(-1)^k}{k} \binom{n+1}{k} \sum_{j=1}^k j^n &lt;/math&gt;

|9 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}} and {{math|''m'' ≥ 1}}.  Then {{harv|Carlitz|1968}}

: &lt;math&gt; (-1)^m \sum_{r=0}^m \binom{m}{r} B_{n+r}=(-1)^n \sum_{s=0}^n \binom{n}{s} B_{m+s} &lt;/math&gt;

|10 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 4}} and

: &lt;math&gt; H_n=\sum_{k=1}^n k^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

the [[harmonic number]]. Then (H. Miki 1978)

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{n}{2}\sum_{k=2}^{n-2}\frac{B_{n-k}}{n-k}\frac{B_k}{k} - \sum_{k=2}^{n-2} \binom{n}{k}\frac{B_{n-k}}{n-k} B_k =H_n B_n&lt;/math&gt;

|11 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 4}}. [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] found (1997)

: &lt;math&gt; (n+2)\sum_{k=2}^{n-2}B_k B_{n-k}-2\sum_{l=2}^{n-2}\binom{n+2}{l} B_l B_{n-l}=n(n+1)B_n &lt;/math&gt;

|12 = ''Faber–[[Rahul Pandharipande|Pandharipande]]–[[Zagier]]–Gessel identity'': for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}},

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{n}{2}\left(B_{n-1}(x)+\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{B_{k}(x)}{k}
\frac{B_{n-k}(x)}{n-k}\right) -\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\binom{n}{k}\frac{B_{n-k}}
{n-k} B_k(x) =H_{n-1}B_n(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Choosing {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} or {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}} results in the Bernoulli number identity in one or another convention.

|13 = The next formula is true for {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}} if {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(1) {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}}, but only for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}} if {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(0) {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}}}}.

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \frac{B_k}{n-k+2} = \frac{B_{n+1}}{n+1} &lt;/math&gt;

|14 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}}. Then

:&lt;math&gt; -1 + \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \frac{2^{n-k+1}}{n-k+1}B_k(1) = 2^n &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; -1 + \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \frac{2^{n-k+1}}{n-k+1}B_{k}(0) = \delta_{n,0} &lt;/math&gt;

|15 = A reciprocity relation of M.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;Gelfand {{harv|Agoh|Dilcher|2008}}:

: &lt;math&gt; (-1)^{m+1} \sum_{j=0}^k \binom{k}{j} \frac{B_{m+1+j}}{m+1+j} + (-1)^{k+1} \sum_{j=0}^m \binom{m}{j}\frac{B_{k+1+j}}{k+1+j} = \frac{k!m!}{(k+m+1)!} &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Left side of Flying Pigeon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The most popular bicycle model—and most popular [[vehicle]] of any kind in the world—is the Chinese [[Flying Pigeon]], with about 500 million produced.&lt;ref name=Koeppel2007/&gt; ]]

A '''bicycle''', also called a '''cycle''' or '''bike''', is a [[human-powered transport|human-powered]] or [[motorized bicycle|motor-powered]], [[bicycle pedal|pedal-driven]], [[single-track vehicle]], having two [[bicycle wheel|wheels]] attached to a [[bicycle frame|frame]], one behind the other. A {{vanchor|bicycle rider|BICYCLE_RIDER}} is called a [[Cycling|cyclist]], or bicyclist.

Bicycles were introduced in the late 19th century in Europe, and by the early 21st century, more than 1 billion were in existence at a given time.&lt;ref name=Koeppel2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=worldmeters/&gt; These numbers far exceed the number of cars, both in total and ranked by the number of individual models produced.&lt;ref name=Squatriglia2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AMA2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;
They are the principal [[means of transportation]] in many regions. They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for use as children's toys, [[Physical fitness|general fitness]], military and police applications, [[courier services]], [[bicycle racing]] and bicycle stunts.

The basic shape and configuration of a typical [[Safety bicycle|upright or "safety bicycle"]], has changed little since the first [[Chain drive|chain-driven]] model was developed around 1885.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=200–50}}{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=266–71}}{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|p=280}} However, many details have been improved, especially since the advent of [[modern materials]] and [[computer-aided design]]. These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for many types of [[cycling]].

The bicycle's invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing modern industrial methods. Several components that eventually played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially invented for use in the bicycle, including [[ball bearing]]s, [[pneumatic tires]], [[chain-driven sprocket]]s and [[wire wheels|tension-spoked wheels]].&lt;ref&gt;Heitmann JA. ''The Automobile and American Life''. McFarland, 2009, {{ISBN|0786440139}}, pp. 11 and following&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''bicycle'' first appeared in English print in ''[[The Daily News (UK)|The Daily News]]'' in 1868, to describe "Bysicles and trysicles" on the "Champs Elysées and Bois de Boulogne".&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{OED|bicycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was first used in 1847 in a French publication to describe an unidentified two-wheeled vehicle, possibly a carriage.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; The design of the bicycle was an advance on the [[velocipede]], although the words were used with some degree of overlap for a time.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bicycle |title=bicycle (n.) |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other words for bicycle include "bike",&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|bike}}&lt;/ref&gt; "pushbike",&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|pushbike}}&lt;/ref&gt; "pedal cycle",&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|pedal cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "cycle".&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Unicode]], the [[code point]] for "bicycle" is 0x1F6B2. The [[Numeric character reference|entity]] &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#x1F6B2;&lt;/code&gt; in [[HTML]] produces 🚲.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F680.pdf |title=Transport and Map Symbols |publisher=unicode.org |accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the bicycle}}
[[File:Draisine or Laufmaschine, around 1820. Archetype of the Bicycle. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|Wooden ''[[Dandy horse|draisine]]'' (around 1820), the first two-wheeler and as such the archetype of the bicycle]]
The "[[Dandy horse]]", also called Draisienne or Laufmaschine, was the first human means of transport to use only two wheels in [[tandem]] and was invented by the German [[Freiherr|Baron]] [[Karl Drais|Karl von Drais]]. It is regarded as the modern bicycle's forerunner; Drais introduced it to the public in [[Mannheim]] in summer 1817 and in Paris in 1818.&lt;ref name=csts&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Canada Science and Technology Museum |title=Baron von Drais' Bicycle |url=http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/collection/cycles2.cfm |accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|p=26}} Its rider sat astride a wooden frame supported by two in-line wheels and pushed the vehicle along with his or her feet while steering the front wheel.&lt;ref name=csts/&gt;

[[File:Michauxjun.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Michaux's son on a velocipede 1868]]
The first mechanically-propelled, two-wheeled vehicle may have been built by [[Kirkpatrick MacMillan]], a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839, although the claim is often disputed.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=66–67}} He is also associated with the first recorded instance of a [[cycling]] traffic offense, when a [[Glasgow]] newspaper in 1842 reported an accident in which an anonymous "gentleman from Dumfries-shire... bestride a velocipede... of ingenious design" knocked over a little girl in Glasgow and was fined five [[shilling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13040607 |title=Is dangerous cycling a problem? |publisher=BBC News |date=13 April 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1860s, Frenchmen [[Pierre Michaux]] and [[Pierre Lallement]] took bicycle design in a new direction by adding a mechanical [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] drive with pedals on an enlarged front wheel (the [[velocipede]]). This was the first in mass production. Another French inventor named Douglas Grasso had a failed prototype of Pierre Lallement's bicycle several years earlier. Several inventions followed using rear-wheel drive, the best known being the rod-driven velocipede by Scotsman [[Thomas McCall]] in 1869. In that same year, bicycle wheels with wire spokes were patented by Eugène Meyer of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin des lois de la République française'' (1873) 12th series, vol. 6, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8S0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA648#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 648, patent no. 86,705: "Perfectionnements dans les roues de vélocipèdes"] (Improvements in the wheels of bicycles), issued: 4 August 1869.&lt;/ref&gt; The French ''vélocipède'', made of iron and wood, developed into the "[[penny-farthing]]" (historically known as an "ordinary bicycle", a [[retronym]], since there was then no other kind).{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=50}} It featured a tubular steel frame on which were mounted wire-spoked wheels with solid rubber tires. These bicycles were difficult to ride due to their high seat and poor [[weight distribution]]. In 1868 Rowley Turner, a sales agent of the Coventry Sewing Machine Company (which soon became the [[Hillman#History|Coventry Machinists Company]]), brought a Michaux cycle to [[Coventry]], England. His uncle, Josiah Turner, and business partner [[James Starley]], used this as a basis for the 'Coventry Model' in what became Britain's first cycle factory.&lt;ref&gt;McGrory, David. ''A History of Coventry'' (Chichester: Phillimore, 2003), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1886 Starley 'Rover' Safety Cycle British Motor Museum 09-2016 (29928044262).jpg|thumb|1886 [[Rover Company#Before cars|Rover]] [[safety bicycle]] at the [[British Motor Museum]]. The first modern bicycle, it featured a rear-wheel-drive, [[chain-drive]]n cycle with two similar-sized wheels. Dunlop's [[pneumatic tire]] was added to the bicycle in 1888.]]
The ''dwarf ordinary'' addressed some of these faults by reducing the front wheel diameter and setting the [[bicycle seat|seat]] further back. This, in turn, required gearing—effected in a variety of ways—to efficiently use pedal power. Having to both pedal and steer via the front wheel remained a problem. Englishman [[John Kemp Starley|J.K. Starley]] (nephew of James Starley), J.H. Lawson, and Shergold solved this problem by introducing the [[chain drive]] (originated by the unsuccessful "bicyclette" of Englishman Henry Lawson),{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=47}} connecting the frame-mounted cranks to the rear wheel. These models were known as [[safety bicycle]]s, dwarf safeties, or upright bicycles for their lower seat height and better weight distribution, although without pneumatic tires the ride of the smaller-wheeled bicycle would be much rougher than that of the larger-wheeled variety. Starley's 1885 [[Rover Company|Rover]], manufactured in Coventry&lt;ref&gt;McGrory, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; is usually described as the first recognizably modern bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cycle market: Moving into the fast lane|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/cycle-market-moving-into-the-fast-lane-1702191.html|agency=The Independent|date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the ''seat tube'' was added, creating the modern bike's double-triangle ''diamond frame''.

[[File:John Boyd Dunlop (c1915).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[John Boyd Dunlop]] on a bicycle c. 1915]]
Further innovations increased comfort and ushered in a second [[bicycle craze]], the 1890s ''Golden Age of Bicycles''. In 1888, Scotsman [[John Boyd Dunlop]] introduced the first practical [[pneumatic tire]], which soon became universal. [[Willie Hume]] demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop's tyres in 1889, winning the tyre's first-ever races in Ireland and then England.&lt;ref name="Gold Hume"&gt;[http://www.thepedalclub.org/archives/goldenbook/u-z/WilliamHume.html The Golden Book of Cycling – William Hume, 1938.

This refinement led to the 1890s invention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Derailleur gears|Dérailleur gears]] and hand-operated [[Bowden cable]]-pull brakes were also developed during these years, but were only slowly adopted by casual riders.

The [[Svea Velocipede]] with vertical pedal arrangement and [[locking hubs]] was introduced in 1892 by the Swedish engineers [[Fredrik Ljungström]] and [[Birger Ljungström]]. It attracted attention at the [[World Fair]] and was produced in a few thousand units.

[[File:Old CTC sign.jpg|thumb|[[Cycling UK|Cyclists' Touring Club]] sign on display at the [[National Museum of Scotland]]]]

In the 1870s many [[cycling club]]s flourished. They were popular in a time when there were not cars on the market and the principal mode of transportation was [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s, such the [[horse and buggy]] or the [[horsecar]]. Among the earliest clubs was [[Cycling UK|The Bicycle Touring Club]], which has operated since 1878.
By the turn of the century, cycling clubs flourished on both sides of the Atlantic, and touring and racing became widely popular. The [[Raleigh Bicycle Company]] was founded in Nottingham, England in 1888. It became the biggest bicycle manufacturing company in the world, making over two million bikes per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On Your Bike...|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/eastmidlands/series2/raleigh_bikes_cycling.shtml|agency=BBC|date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bicycles and horse buggies were the two mainstays of private transportation just prior to the automobile, and the grading of smooth roads in the late 19th century was stimulated by the widespread advertising, production, and use of these devices.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|p=280}} More than 1 billion bicycles have been manufactured worldwide as of the early 21st century.&lt;ref name=Koeppel2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=worldmeters/&gt; Bicycles are the most common [[vehicle]] of any kind in the world, and the most numerous model of any kind of vehicle, whether human-powered or [[motor vehicle]], is the Chinese [[Flying Pigeon]], with numbers exceeding 500 million.&lt;ref name=Koeppel2007/&gt; The next most numerous vehicle, the [[Honda Super Cub]] motorcycle, has more than 60 million units made, while most produced car, the [[Toyota Corolla]], has reached 35 million and counting.&lt;ref name=Squatriglia2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AMA2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;&lt;ref name=FoxBusiness/&gt;

==Uses==
From the beginning and still today, bicycles have been and are employed for many uses. In a utilitarian way, bicycles are used for transportation, [[bicycle commuting]], and [[utility cycling]]. It can be used as a 'work horse', used by [[Bicycle mail|mail carriers]], [[paramedic]]s, [[Police bicycle|police]], [[Bicycle messenger|messengers]], and [[Freight bicycle|general delivery]] services. Military uses of bicycles include [[Military communications|communications]], [[reconnaissance]], troop movement, supply of provisions, and [[patrol]]. See also: [[bicycle infantry]].

The bicycle is also used for recreational purposes, such as [[bicycle touring]], [[mountain biking]], [[physical fitness]], and play. [[Cycle sport|Bicycle competition]] includes [[Road bicycle racing|racing]], [[BMX racing]], [[Track cycling|track racing]], [[criterium]], [[bicycle rollers|roller racing]], [[cyclosportive|sportives]] and [[time trial]]s. Major multi-stage professional events are the [[Giro d'Italia]], the [[Tour de France]], the [[Vuelta a España]], the [[Tour de Pologne]], and the [[Volta a Portugal]].

Bikes can be used for entertainment and pleasure, such as in organised mass rides, [[artistic cycling]] and [[freestyle BMX]].

==Technical aspects==

The bicycle has undergone continual adaptation and improvement since its inception. These innovations have continued with the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design, allowing for a proliferation of specialized bicycle types, improved [[bicycle safety]], and riding comfort.

===Types===
{{Main|List of bicycle types}}
Bicycles can be categorized in many different ways: by function, by number of riders, by general construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion. The more common types include [[utility bicycle]]s, [[mountain bicycle]]s, [[racing bicycle]]s, [[touring bicycle]]s, [[hybrid bicycle]]s, [[cruiser bicycle]]s, and [[BMX bike]]s. Less common are [[tandem bicycle|tandems]], [[Lowrider bicycle|low riders]], [[tall bike]]s, [[Fixed-gear bicycle|fixed gear]], [[folding bicycle|folding models]], [[amphibious bicycles]], cargo bikes, [[recumbent bicycle|recumbents]] and [[electric bicycles]].

[[Unicycle]]s, [[tricycle]]s and [[Quadracycle (human-powered vehicle)|quadracycles]] are not strictly bicycles, as they have respectively one, three and four wheels, but are often referred to informally as "bikes" or "cycles".

===Dynamics===
{{Main|Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics}}
A bicycle stays upright while moving forward by being steered so as to keep its [[center of mass]] over the wheels.&lt;ref name=NS2581&gt;{{cite journal

===Performance===
{{Main|Bicycle performance}}
The bicycle is extraordinarily efficient in both biological and mechanical terms. The bicycle is the most efficient human-powered means of transportation in terms of energy a person must expend to travel a given distance.&lt;ref&gt;S. S. Wilson, "Bicycle Technology", ''[[Scientific American]]'', March 1973&lt;/ref&gt; From a mechanical viewpoint, up to 99% of the energy delivered by the rider into the pedals is transmitted to the wheels, although the use of gearing mechanisms may reduce this by 10–15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pedal power probe shows bicycles waste little energy |url=http://www.jhu.edu/~gazette/1999/aug3099/30pedal.html |work=Johns Hopkins Gazette |date=August 30, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitt"&gt;{{cite book

In terms of the ratio of cargo weight a bicycle can carry to total weight, it is also an efficient means of cargo transportation.

A human traveling on a bicycle at low to medium speeds of around {{Convert|16|–|24|km/h|abbr=on|0}} uses only the power required to walk. Air drag, which is proportional to the square of speed, requires dramatically higher power outputs as speeds increase. If the rider is sitting upright, the rider's body creates about 75% of the total drag of the bicycle/rider combination. Drag can be reduced by seating the rider in a more [[aerodynamic]]ally streamlined position. Drag can also be reduced by covering the bicycle with an aerodynamic [[Bicycle fairing|fairing]]. The fastest recorded unpaced speed on a flat surface is {{Convert|144.18|km/h|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="upi"&gt;{{cite web

In addition, the [[carbon dioxide]] generated in the production and transportation of the food required by the bicyclist, per mile traveled, is less than 1/10 that generated by energy efficient motorcars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenkifer.com/bikepages/advocacy/bike_co2.htm |title=How Much Do Bicycles Pollute?

==Parts==

===Frame===
{{Main|Bicycle frame}}

[[File:Bicycle diagram-en.svg|thumb|Diagram of a bicycle.]]

The great majority of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first chain-driven bike.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=200–50}}{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=266–71}}{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|p=280}} These upright bicycles almost always feature the ''diamond frame'', a [[truss]] consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down tube, and seat tube. The head tube contains the [[headset (bicycle part)|headset]], the set of bearings that allows the [[bicycle fork|fork]] to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The top tube connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the [[bottom bracket]]. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the [[bicycle chain|chain]], connecting the bottom bracket to the rear [[Fork end|dropout]], where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect the top of the seat tube (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.

[[File:Triumph Bicycle.JPG|left|thumb|A [[Triumph Cycle Co. Ltd.|Triumph]] with a [[step-through frame]].]]
Historically, women's bicycle frames had a top tube that connected in the middle of the seat tube instead of the top, resulting in a lower [[Frame geometry|standover height]] at the expense of compromised structural integrity, since this places a strong bending load in the seat tube, and bicycle frame members are typically weak in bending. This design, referred to as a ''[[step-through frame]]'' or as an ''open frame'', allows the rider to mount and dismount in a dignified way while wearing a skirt or dress. While some women's bicycles continue to use this frame style, there is also a variation, the ''[[mixte]]'', which splits the top tube laterally into two thinner top tubes that bypass the seat tube on each side and connect to the rear fork ends. The ease of stepping through is also appreciated by those with limited flexibility or other joint problems. Because of its persistent image as a "women's" bicycle, step-through frames are not common for larger frames.

Step-throughs were popular partly for practical reasons and partly for social mores of the day. For most of the history of bicycles' popularity women have worn long skirts, and the lower frame accommodated these better than the top-tube. Furthermore, it was considered "unladylike" for women to open their legs to mount and dismount – in more conservative times women who rode bicycles at all were vilified as immoral or immodest. These practices were akin to the older practice of riding horse [[sidesaddle]].

Another style is the [[recumbent bicycle]]. These are inherently more aerodynamic than upright versions, as the rider may lean back onto a support and operate pedals that are on about the same level as the seat. The world's fastest bicycle is a recumbent bicycle but this type was banned from competition in 1934 by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recumbent-bikes-truth-for-you.com/history.html |title=History Loudly Tells Why The Recumbent Bike Is Popular Today |publisher=Recumbent-bikes-truth-for-you.com |date=1934-04-01 |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trek Y Foil.jpg|thumb|right|A carbon fiber [[Trek Bicycle Corporation|Trek]] Y-Foil from the late 1990s]]
Historically, materials used in bicycles have followed a similar pattern as in aircraft, the goal being high strength and low weight. Since the late 1930s alloy steels have been used for frame and fork tubes in higher quality machines. By the 1980s aluminum welding techniques had improved to the point that aluminum tube could safely be used in place of steel. Since then aluminum alloy frames and other components have become popular due to their light weight, and most mid-range bikes are now principally aluminum alloy of some kind.{{Where?|date=August 2012}} More expensive bikes use [[carbon fibre]] due to its significantly lighter weight and profiling ability, allowing designers to make a bike both stiff and compliant by manipulating the lay-up. Virtually all professional racing bicycles now use carbon fibre frames, as they have the best strength to weight ratio. A typical modern carbon fiber frame can weighs less than {{convert|1|kg|lb}}.

Other exotic frame materials include [[titanium]] and advanced alloys. [[Bamboo]], a natural [[composite material]] with high strength-to-weight ratio and [[stiffness]]&lt;ref name=Lakkad&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0015056881900233 |title=Mechanical properties of bamboo, a natural composite |last1=Lakkad |last2=Patel |journal=Fibre Science and Technology |volume=14 |issue=4 |date=June 1981 |pages=319–22 |doi=10.1016/0015-0568(81)90023-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been used for bicycles since 1894.&lt;ref name=lukenbill&gt;{{cite web

===Drivetrain and gearing===
{{Main|Bicycle drivetrain systems}}
[[File:Dsb-1.jpg|thumb|left|text-top|A [[Shaft-driven bicycle|bicycle with shaft drive]] instead of a chain]]
[[File:Shimano xt rear derailleur.jpg|upright|thumb|A set of rear sprockets (also known as a cassette) and a derailleur]]
[[File:Hub gear.jpg|upright|thumb|Hub gear]]

The ''drivetrain'' begins with pedals which rotate the [[Crank set|cranks]], which are held in axis by the bottom bracket. Most bicycles use a chain to transmit power to the rear wheel. A very small number of bicycles use a shaft drive to transmit power, or special belts. Hydraulic bicycle transmissions have been built, but they are currently inefficient and complex.

Since cyclists' legs are most efficient over a narrow range of pedaling speeds, or [[Cadence (cycling)|cadence]], a variable [[gear ratio]] helps a cyclist to maintain an optimum pedalling speed while covering varied terrain. Some, mainly utility, bicycles use [[hub gear]]s with between 3 and 14 ratios, but most use the generally more efficient dérailleur system, by which the chain is moved between different cogs called chainrings and sprockets in order to select a ratio. A dérailleur system normally has two dérailleurs, or mechs, one at the front to select the [[chainring]] and another at the back to select the sprocket. Most bikes have two or three chainrings, and from 5 to 11 sprockets on the back, with the number of theoretical gears calculated by multiplying front by back. In reality, many gears overlap or require the chain to run diagonally, so the number of usable gears is fewer.

An alternative to chaindrive is to use a synchronous belt. These are toothed and work much the same as a chain – popular with commuters and long distance cyclists they require little maintenance. They can't be shifted across a cassette of sprockets, and are used either as single speed or with a hub gear.

[[Bicycle gearing|Different gears and ranges of gears]] are appropriate for different people and styles of cycling. Multi-speed bicycles allow gear selection to suit the circumstances: a cyclist could use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill. In a lower gear every turn of the pedals leads to fewer rotations of the rear wheel. This allows the energy required to move the same distance to be distributed over more pedal turns, reducing fatigue when riding uphill, with a heavy load, or against strong winds. A higher gear allows a cyclist to make fewer pedal turns to maintain a given speed, but with more effort per turn of the pedals.

With a ''chain drive'' transmission, a ''chainring'' attached to a crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear sprocket(s) ([[cassette (bicycle part)|cassette]] or [[Cogset#Freewheels|freewheel]]). There are four gearing options: two-speed hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 sprockets, hub gear built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple sprockets (other combinations of options are possible but less common).

===Steering===
[[File:Anatomic bicycle grips made of leather.jpg|thumb|left|Bicycle grips made of leather. Anatomic shape distributes weight over [[hand|palm area]] to prevent Cyclist's palsy ([[Ulnar tunnel syndrome|Ulnar syndrome]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid = 12860549|year = 2003|last1 = Patterson|first1 = J.

I.|doi = 10.1177/03635465030310041801}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebars]] connect to the [[Stem (bike)|stem]] that connects to the fork that connects to the front wheel, and the whole assembly connects to the bike and rotates about the steering axis via the [[Headset (bicycle part)|headset]] bearings. Three styles of handlebar are common. ''Upright handlebars'', the norm in Europe and elsewhere until the 1970s, curve gently back toward the rider, offering a natural grip and comfortable upright position. ''Drop handlebars'' "drop" as they curve forward and down, offering the cyclist best braking power from a more aerodynamic "crouched" position, as well as more upright positions in which the hands grip the brake lever mounts, the forward curves, or the upper flat sections for increasingly upright postures. Mountain bikes generally feature a 'straight handlebar' or 'riser bar' with varying degrees of sweep backwards and centimeters rise upwards, as well as wider widths which can provide better handling due to increased leverage against the wheel.

===Seating===
[[File:San marco selle1.jpg|thumb|left|A Selle San Marco saddle designed for women]]
[[Bicycle saddle|Saddles]] also vary with rider preference, from the cushioned ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow more room for leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist for male and female cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men. Suspension seat posts and seat springs provide comfort by absorbing shock but can add to the overall weight of the bicycle.

A recumbent bicycle has a reclined [[Bicycle seat|chair-like seat]] that some riders find more comfortable than a saddle, especially riders who suffer from certain types of seat, back, neck, shoulder, or wrist pain. Recumbent bicycles may have either under-seat or over-seat [[Recumbent bicycle#Steering|steering]].

===Brakes===
{{Main|Bicycle brake}}
[[File:Brake.agr-edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Linear-pull brake, also known by the [[Shimano]] trademark: V-Brake, on rear wheel of a [[mountain bike]]]]
Bicycle brakes may be rim brakes, in which friction pads are compressed against the wheel rims; hub brakes, where the mechanism is contained within the wheel hub, or disc brakes, where pads act on a rotor attached to the hub. Most road bicycles use rim brakes, but some use disk brakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyclingtips.com.au/2013/10/disc-brakes-and-road-bikes-what-does-the-future-hold/ |title=Disc Brakes and Road Bikes: What does the Future Hold? |publisher=cyclingtips.com.au |date=1 October 2013 |accessdate=24 February 2014 |author=Wade Wallace}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Disc brakes]] are more common for mountain bikes, tandems and recumbent bicycles than on other types of bicycles, due to their increased power, coupled with an increased weight and complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sheldonbrown.com/disc-brakes.html |title=Disc Brakes |publisher=sheldonbrown.com |author=John Allan |accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BrakeDiskVR.JPG|thumb|left|A front disc brake, mounted to the [[Bicycle fork|fork]] and hub]]
With hand-operated brakes, force is applied to brake levers mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via Bowden cables or [[hydraulic]] lines to the friction pads, which apply pressure to the braking surface, causing friction which slows the bicycle down. A rear hub brake may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal ''coaster brakes'' which were popular in North America until the 1960s.

[[Track bicycle]]s do not have brakes, because all riders ride in the same direction around a track which does not necessitate sharp deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all track bicycles are fixed-gear, meaning that there is no freewheel. Without a freewheel, coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is moving, the cranks are moving. To slow down, the rider applies resistance to the pedals, acting as a braking system which can be as effective as a conventional rear wheel brake, but not as effective as a front wheel brake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Suspension===
{{Main|Bicycle suspension}}

Bicycle suspension refers to the system or systems used to ''suspend'' the rider and all or part of the bicycle. This serves two purposes: to keep the wheels in continuous contact with the ground, improving control, and to isolate the rider and luggage from jarring due to rough surfaces, improving comfort.

Bicycle suspensions are used primarily on mountain bicycles, but are also common on hybrid bicycles, as they can help deal with problematic vibration from poor surfaces. Suspension is especially important on recumbent bicycles, since while an upright bicycle rider can stand on the pedals to achieve some of the benefits of suspension, a recumbent rider cannot.

Basic mountain bicycles and hybrids usually have front suspension only, whilst more sophisticated ones also have rear suspension. Road bicycles tend to have no suspension.

===Wheels and tires===
{{Main|Bicycle wheel|Bicycle tire}}

The wheel axle fits into fork ends in the frame and fork. A pair of wheels may be called a wheelset, especially in the context of ready-built "off the shelf", performance-oriented wheels.

Tires vary enormously depending on their intended purpose. [[Road bicycles]] use tires 18 to 25 millimeters wide, most often completely smooth, or [[slick tire|slick]], and inflated to high pressure in order to roll fast on smooth surfaces. Off-road tires are usually between {{Convert|38|and|64|mm|abbr=on}} wide, and have treads for gripping in muddy conditions or metal studs for ice.

===Accessories===
[[File:Loaded touring bicycle.JPG|thumb|Touring bicycle equipped with front and rear [[Luggage carrier|racks]], fenders/mud-guards, water bottles in [[Bottle cage|cages]], four [[pannier]]s and a handlebar bag.]]

Some components, which are often optional accessories on sports bicycles, are standard features on utility bicycles to enhance their usefulness, comfort, safety and visibility. [[Mudguard]]s, or [[Fender (vehicle)|fenders]], protect the cyclist and [[moving parts]] from spray when riding through wet areas and [[chainguard]]s protect clothes from oil on the chain while preventing clothing from being caught between the chain and [[crankset]] teeth. [[Kick stand]]s keep bicycles upright when parked, and [[bike lock]]s deter theft. Front-mounted [[bicycle basket|baskets]], front or rear [[luggage carrier]]s or racks, and [[pannier]]s mounted above either or both wheels can be used to carry equipment or cargo. Pegs can be fastened to one, or both of the wheel hubs to either help the rider perform certain tricks, or allow a place for extra riders to stand, or rest.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Parents sometimes add rear-mounted [[Baby transport|child seats]], an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar, or both to transport children. [[Training wheels]] are sometimes used when learning to ride.

[[Clipless#Clipless pedals|Toe-clips]] and toestraps and [[Bicycle pedal#Clipless pedals|clipless pedals]] help keep the foot locked in the proper pedal position and enable cyclists to pull and push the pedals. Technical accessories include [[cyclocomputer]]s for measuring speed, distance, heart rate, GPS data etc. Other accessories include [[bicycle lighting|lights]], reflectors, mirrors, racks, trailers, bags, water bottles and [[Bottle cage|cages]], and [[Bicycle bell|bell]].&lt;ref name="bicycleuniverse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bicycleuniverse.info/eqp/accessories.html#safety |title=Safety Accessories |accessdate=2006-09-13 |last=Bluejay |first=Michael |work=Bicycle Accessories |publisher=BicycleUniverse.info| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061008024853/http://bicycleuniverse.info/eqp/accessories.html| archivedate= 8 October 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bicycle lights, reflectors, and helmets are required by law in some geographic regions depending on the legal code. It is more common to see bicycles with bottle generators, dynamos, lights, fenders, racks and bells in Europe. Bicyclists also have specialized form fitting and high visibility clothing.

[[Bicycle helmet]]s can reduce injury in the event of a collision or accident, and a suitable helmet is legally required of riders in many jurisdictions. Helmets may be classified as an accessory&lt;ref name="bicycleuniverse" /&gt; or as an item of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bicycling.about.com/library/weekly/aa041098.htm |title=The Essentials of Bike Clothing |accessdate=2006-09-13 |work=About Bicycling |publisher=About.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060826085232/http://bicycling.about.com/library/weekly/aa041098.htm| archivedate= 26 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bicycle trainer|Bike trainers]] are used to enable cyclists to cycle while the bike remains stationary. They are frequently used to warm up before races or indoors when riding conditions are unfavorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bicycleadvisor.com/best-bike-trainer/ |title= Bicycle Advisor |publisher=bicycleadvisor.com |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bicycles can also be fitted with a hitch to tow a [[bicycle trailer|trailer]] for carrying cargo, a child, or both.

===Standards===
A number of formal and industry standards exist for bicycle components to help make spare parts exchangeable and to maintain a minimum product safety.

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) has a special technical committee for cycles, TC149, that has the scope of "Standardization in the field of cycles, their components and accessories with particular reference to terminology, testing methods and requirements for performance and safety, and interchangeability".

The [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN) also has a specific Technical Committee, TC333, that defines European standards for cycles. Their mandate states that EN cycle standards shall harmonize with [[List of ISO standards|ISO standards]]. Some CEN cycle standards were developed before ISO published their standards, leading to strong European influences in this area. European cycle standards tend to describe minimum safety requirements, while ISO standards have historically harmonized parts geometry.&lt;ref&gt;The TC149 ISO bicycle committee, including the TC149/SC1 ("Cycles and major sub-assemblies") subcommittee, has published the following standards:{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}
* [[ISO 4210]] Cycles—Safety requirements for bicycles

* [[ISO 8562]] Cycles—Stem wedge angle
* [[ISO 10230]] Cycles—Splined hub and sprocket—Mating dimensions
* [[ISO 11243]] Cycles—Luggage carriers for bicycles—Concepts, classification and testing

Other ISO Technical Committees have published various cycle relevant standards, for example:
* [[ISO 5775]] Bicycle tire and rim designations
* [[ISO 9633]] Cycle chains—Characteristics and test methods

Published cycle standards from CEN TC333 include:
* [[EN 14764]] City and trekking bicycles – Safety requirements and test methods
* [[EN 14765]] Bicycles for young children – Safety requirements and test methods
* [[EN 14766]] Mountain-bicycles – Safety requirements and test methods
* [[EN 14781]] Racing bicycles – Safety requirements and test methods
* [[EN 14782]] Bicycles – Accessories for bicycles – Luggage carriers
* [[EN 15496]] Cycles – Requirements and test methods for cycle locks

Yet to be approved cycle standards from CEN TC333:
* [[EN 15194]] Cycles—Electrically power assisted cycles ([[Electric bicycle#cite ref-15|EPAC]] bicycle)
* [[EN 15532]] Cycles—Terminology
* 00333011 Cycles – Bicycles trailers – safety requirements and test methods&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance and repair==
Maintenance of adequate tire inflation is the most frequent and troublesome concern for cyclists and many means and methods are employed to preserve pneumatic integrity. Thicker tires, thicker tubes, tire liners (of a number of rather impenetrable devices installed between the tire and tube), liquid sealing compounds squeezed into the tube, and automotive-style patch kits are all used to reliably contain the typical tire pressures of 40 to 60 pounds per square inch that are required for bicycle operation. Thin, light bicycle tires are particularly vulnerable to penetration and subsequent deflation caused by [[goat's head]]s and other [[bur]]s, colloquially known as stickers. Inflation of bicycle tires to pressures higher than typical for automotive use requires special pumps. The complexity of bicycle tire maintenance and repair may cause many to not consider the bicycle for transport or leisure.

Some bicycle parts, particularly hub-based gearing systems, require considerable torque for dis-assembly and may thus need professional services. [[Self-service]] and assisted-service [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|maintenance and repair]] may be available.
* Some cyclists choose self-service: they maintain their own bicycles, perhaps as part of their enjoyment of the hobby of cycling or simply for economic reasons.
* There exist several hundred assisted-service Community Bicycle Organizations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Bicycle Organizations|url=http://www.bikecollectives.org/wiki/index.php?title=Community_Bicycle_Organizations|publisher=Bike Collective Network wiki|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a Community Bicycle Organization, [[wikt:layperson#Noun|laypeople]] bring in bicycles needing repair or maintenance; volunteers teach them how to do the required steps.
* Full service is available from [[bicycle mechanic]]s at a [[local bike shop]]. In areas where it is available, some cyclists purchase roadside assistance from companies such as the [[Better World Club]] or the [[American Automobile Association]].

===Tools===

{{main|Bicycle tools}}

There are specialized bicycle tools for use both in the shop and on the road. Many cyclists carry tool kits. These may include a tire patch kit (which, in turn, may contain any combination of a [[Bicycle pump|hand pump]] or [[Bicycle pump#CO2 Inflators|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Pump]], [[tire lever]]s, spare [[Inner tube|tubes]], self-adhesive patches, or tube-patching material, an adhesive, a piece of sandpaper or a metal grater (for roughing the tube surface to be patched), Special, thin wrenches are often required for maintaining various screw fastened parts, specifically, the frequently lubricated ball-bearing "cones".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are also cycling specific [[multi-tool]]s that combine many of these implements into a single compact device. More specialized bicycle components may require more complex tools, including proprietary tools specific for a given manufacturer.

==Social and historical aspects==
The bicycle has had a considerable effect on human society, in both the cultural and industrial realms.

===In daily life===
Around the turn of the 20th century, bicycles reduced crowding in inner-city tenements by allowing workers to commute from more spacious dwellings in the suburbs. They also reduced dependence on horses. Bicycles allowed people to travel for leisure into the country, since bicycles were three times as energy efficient as walking and three to four times as fast.

In built up cities around the world, [[urban planning]] uses [[cycling infrastructure]] like bikeways to reduce [[traffic congestion]] and [[air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3005092 | pmid=21174189 | doi=10.1007/s11524-010-9509-6 | volume=87 | issue=6 | title=Built environment influences on healthy transportation choices: bicycling versus driving | year=2010 | journal=J Urban Health | pages=969–93 | last1 = Winters | first1 = M | last2 = Brauer | first2 = M | last3 = Setton | first3 = EM | last4 = Teschke | first4 = K}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of cities around the world have implemented schemes known as [[bicycle sharing system]]s or community bicycle programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shaheen |first1=Susan |last2=Guzman |first2=Stacey |last3=Zhang |first3=Hua |title=Bikesharing in Europe, the Americas, and Asia |journal=Transportation Research Record |volume=2143 |year=2010 |pages=159–67 |doi=10.3141/2143-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaheen |first=Stacey |author2=Stacey Guzman |title=Worldwide Bikesharing |journal=Access Magazine |year=2011 |url=http://uctc.net/access/39/access39_bikesharing.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326063609/http://www.uctc.net/access/39/access39_bikesharing.shtml |archivedate=2012-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these was the White Bicycle plan in [[Amsterdam]] in 1965. It was followed by yellow bicycles in [[La Rochelle]] and green bicycles in [[Cambridge]]. These initiatives complement public transport systems and offer an alternative to motorized traffic to help reduce congestion and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shaheen |first1=Susan |last2=Zhang |first2=Hua |last3=Martin |first3=Elliot |last4=Guzman |first4=Stacey |title=China's Hangzhou Public Bicycle |journal=Transportation Research Record |volume=2247 |year=2011 |pages=33–41 |doi=10.3141/2247-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, especially in the Netherlands and parts of Germany and Denmark, bicycle commuting is common. In [[Copenhagen]], a cyclists' organization runs a Cycling Embassy that promotes biking for commuting and sightseeing. The United Kingdom has a tax break scheme (IR 176) that allows employees to buy a new bicycle tax free to use for commuting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/|title=Tax free bikes for work through the Government's Green Transport Initiative  |publisher=Cyclescheme}}{{psc|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands all train stations offer free bicycle parking, or a more secure parking place for a small fee, with the larger stations also offering bicycle repair shops. Cycling is so popular that the parking capacity may be exceeded, while in some places such as Delft the capacity is usually exceeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are towns in some countries where [[bicycle culture]] has been an integral part of the landscape for generations, even without much official support. That is the case of [[Ílhavo Municipality|Ílhavo]], in Portugal.

In cities where bicycles are not integrated into the public transportation system, commuters often use bicycles as elements of a [[mixed-mode commuting|mixed-mode commute]], where the bike is used to travel to and from train stations or other forms of rapid transit. Some students who commute several miles drive a car from home to a campus parking lot, then ride a bicycle to class. [[Folding bicycle]]s are useful in these scenarios, as they are less cumbersome when carried aboard. Los Angeles removed a small amount of seating on some trains to make more room for bicycles and wheel chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some US companies, notably in the [[High tech#Technology sectors|tech sector]], are developing both innovative cycle designs and cycle-friendliness in the workplace. [[Foursquare]], whose [[CEO]] [[Dennis Crowley]] "pedaled to pitch meetings ... [when he] was raising money from [[venture capitalists]]" on a two-wheeler, chose a new location for its [[New York City|New York]] headquarters "based on where biking would be easy". Parking in the office was also integral to HQ planning. Mitchell Moss, who runs the [[Rudin Center for Transportation Policy &amp; Management]] at [[New York University]], said in 2012: "Biking has become the mode of choice for the educated high tech worker".&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Andrea, [http://www.marketplace.org/topics/tech/transportation-nation/techies-cutting-edge-bike-commuting "Techies on the cutting edge... of bike commuting"], ''[[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]]'', February 22, 2012. "Bernstein reports from the [http://transportationnation.org/ Transportation Nation] project at [[WNYC]]". Retrieved 2012-02-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bicycles offer an important mode of transport in many developing countries. Until recently, bicycles have been a staple of everyday life throughout Asian countries. They are the most frequently used method of transport for commuting to work, school, shopping, and life in general. In Europe, bicycles are commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2013/10/24/240493422/in-most-every-european-country-bikes-are-outselling-cars|title=In Almost Every European Country, Bikes Are Outselling New Cars|date=24 October 2013|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also offer a degree of exercise to keep individuals healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/WP90BICYCLE.pdf |first=Marcia D. |last=Lowe |year=1989 |title=The Bicycle: Vehicle for a Small Planet |publisher=Worldwatch Institute |isbn=978-0916468910}}{{page needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bicycles are also celebrated in the visual arts. An example of this is the [[Bicycle Film Festival]], a film festival hosted all around the world.

===Poverty alleviation===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transport, if analyzed for the cost-benefit analysis for rural [[Poverty reduction|poverty alleviation]], has given one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3-10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be an important poverty-eradication tool in poor nations.

===Female emancipation===

[[File:A wheel within a wheel page 56.jpg|thumb|upright| "Let go — but stand by"; [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] learning to ride a bicycle.&lt;ref name=Willard1895/&gt;]]
The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to [[Emancipation of women|their emancipation]] in Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom that bicycles embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolize the [[New Woman]] of the late 19th century, especially in Britain and the United States.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=266–71}}&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts |first1=Jacob |title=Women's work |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1 |pages=6–11 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/womens-work|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bike boom#1890s|bicycle craze in the 1890s]] also led to a movement for so-called [[Victorian dress reform|rational dress]], which helped liberate women from corsets and ankle-length skirts and other restrictive garments, substituting the then-shocking [[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]].{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=266–71}}

The bicycle was recognized by 19th-century feminists and [[suffragist]]s as a "freedom machine" for women. American [[Susan B. Anthony]] said in a ''[[New York World]]'' interview on February 2, 1896:
"I think it has done more to emancipate woman than any one thing in the world. I rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel. It gives her a feeling of self-reliance and independence the moment she takes her seat; and away she goes, the picture of untrammelled womanhood."&lt;ref name=HustedHarper1898/&gt;{{rp|859}} In 1895 [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]], the tightly laced president of the [[Woman’s Christian Temperance Union]], wrote ''A Wheel Within a Wheel: How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle, with Some Reflections by the Way'', a 75-page illustrated memoir praising "Gladys", her bicycle, for its "gladdening effect" on her health and political optimism.&lt;ref name=Willard1895/&gt; Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action.&lt;ref name=Willard1895/&gt;

===Economic implications===
[[File:Columbia Bicycles 1886 Advertisement.svg|left|thumb|upright|[[Columbia Bicycles]] advertisement from 1886]]
[[Bicycle industry|Bicycle manufacturing]] proved to be a training ground for other industries and led to the development of advanced metalworking techniques, both for the frames themselves and for special components such as [[ball bearing]]s, [[washer (mechanical)|washers]], and sprockets. These techniques later enabled skilled metalworkers and mechanics to develop the components used in early automobiles and aircraft.

[[Wright brothers|Wilbur and Orville Wright]], a pair of businessmen, ran the [[Wright Cycle Company]] which designed, manufactured and sold their bicycles during the [[bike boom]] of the 1890s.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11373/ |title = Wilbur Wright Working in the Bicycle Shop |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1897 |accessdate = 2013-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also served to teach the industrial models later adopted, including mechanization and [[mass production]] (later copied and adopted by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors]]),{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=23}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=106}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=108}} vertical integration{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=106}} (also later copied and adopted by Ford), aggressive advertising{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=142–47}} (as much as 10% of all advertising in U.S. periodicals in 1898 was by bicycle makers),{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=145}} lobbying for better roads (which had the side benefit of acting as advertising, and of improving sales by providing more places to ride),{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=108}} all first practiced by Pope.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=108}} In addition, bicycle makers adopted the annual model change{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=23}}&lt;ref&gt;Babaian, Sharon. ''The Most Benevolent Machine: A Historical Assessment of Cycles in Canada'' (Ottawa: National Museum of Science and Technology, 1998), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; (later derided as [[planned obsolescence]], and usually credited to General Motors), which proved very successful.&lt;ref&gt;Babaian, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early bicycles were an example of [[conspicuous consumption]], being adopted by the fashionable elites.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=8}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=12}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=14}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=23}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=147–48}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=187–88}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=208}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=243–45}} In addition, by serving as a platform for accessories, which could ultimately cost more than the bicycle itself, it paved the way for the likes of the [[Barbie doll]].{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=23}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=121}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=123}}

Bicycles helped create, or enhance, new kinds of businesses, such as bicycle messengers,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=212}} traveling seamstresses,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=214}} riding academies,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=131}} and racing rinks.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=30}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=131}} Their board tracks were later adapted to early [[motorcycle racing|motorcycle]] and [[automobile racing]]. There were a variety of new inventions, such as [[spoke]] tighteners,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=125}} and specialized lights,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=123}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=125}} socks and shoes,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=125–26}} and even cameras, such as the [[Eastman Kodak|Eastman Company]]'s Poco.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=238}} Probably the best known and most widely used of these inventions, adopted well beyond cycling, is Charles Bennett's Bike Web, which came to be called the [[jock strap]].{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=128}}

[[File:Person mit fahrrad feb07.jpg|thumb|upright|A man uses a bicycle to carry goods in [[Ouagadougou]], [[Burkina Faso]]]]
They also presaged a move away from public transit{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=214–15}} that would explode with the introduction of the automobile.

J. K. Starley's company became the Rover Cycle Company Ltd. in the late 1890s, and then simply the [[Rover Company]] when it started making cars. [[Morris Motors|Morris Motors Limited]] (in [[Oxford]]) and [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] also began in the bicycle business, as did the [[Wright brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alistair Craig, whose company eventually emerged to become the engine manufacturers [[Ailsa Craig Engines|Ailsa Craig]], also started from manufacturing bicycles, in Glasgow in March 1885.

In general, U.S. and European cycle manufacturers used to assemble cycles from their own frames and components made by other companies, although very large companies (such as Raleigh) used to make almost every part of a bicycle (including bottom brackets, axles, etc.) In recent years, those bicycle makers have greatly changed their methods of production. Now, almost none of them produce their own frames.

Many newer or smaller companies only design and market their products; the actual production is done by Asian companies. For example, some 60% of the world's bicycles are now being made in China. Despite this shift in production, as nations such as China and India become more wealthy, their own use of bicycles has declined due to the increasing affordability of cars and motorcycles.&lt;ref&gt;

===Environmental impact===
One of the profound economic implications of bicycle use is that it liberates the user from oil consumption.(Ballantine, 1972) The bicycle is an inexpensive, fast, healthy and environmentally friendly mode of transport. [[Ivan Illich]] stated that bicycle use extended the usable physical environment for people, while alternatives such as cars and motorways degraded and confined people's environment and mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Illich, I. (1974). ''Energy and equity''. New York, Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, two billion bicycles are in use around the world. Children, students, professionals, laborers, civil servants and seniors are pedaling around their communities. They all experience the freedom and the natural opportunity for exercise that the bicycle easily provides. Bicycle also has lowest carbon intensity of travel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.worldbank.org/publicsphere/global-cyclists-say-no-carbon-opt-cdm "Global cyclists say NO to carbon – opt for CDM"], The World Bank, 27 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal requirements===
{{Main|Bicycle law}}
Early in its development, as with [[automobile]]s, there were restrictions on the operation of bicycles. Along with advertising, and to gain free publicity, [[Albert A. Pope]] litigated on behalf of cyclists.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=108}}

The 1968 [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] of the [[United Nations]] considers a bicycle to be a vehicle, and a person controlling a bicycle (whether actually riding or not) is considered an operator. The traffic codes of many countries reflect these definitions and demand that a bicycle satisfy certain legal requirements before it can be used on public roads. In many [[jurisdiction]]s, it is an offense to use a bicycle that is not in a roadworthy condition.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In most jurisdictions, bicycles must have functioning front and rear lights when ridden after dark. As some generator or [[dynamo]]-driven lamps only operate while moving, rear [[retroreflector|reflectors]] are frequently also mandatory. Since a moving bicycle makes little noise, some countries insist that bicycles have a warning bell for use when approaching pedestrians, equestrians, and other cyclists, though sometimes a [[car horn]] can be used when a 12 volt battery is available.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Some countries require child and/or adult cyclists to wear helmets, as this may protect riders from head trauma. Countries which require adult cyclists to wear helmets include Spain, [[Bicycle helmets in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and Australia. Mandatory helmet wearing is one of the most controversial topics in the cycling world, with proponents arguing that it reduces head injuries and thus is an acceptable requirement, while opponents argue that by making cycling seem more dangerous and cumbersome, it reduces cyclist numbers on the streets, creating an overall negative health effect (fewer people cycling for their own health, and the remaining cyclists being more exposed through a reversed [[safety in numbers]] effect).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Theft===

'''''{{lang|fr|Cinq à sept}}''''' ({{small|French:}} {{IPAc-fr|s|in|q|à|s|è|t}}, literally 'five to seven') is a French term for activities taking place after work (sometime with late work as a cover up), and before returning home or having dinner (roughly between 5 and 7&amp;nbsp;p.m.). 
It may also be written as ''{{lang|fr|5 à 7}}'' or 5@7. 

=== Quebec French === 
In [[Quebec French]], the term stands for a social gathering.  It may bring together friends or colleagues or may be organized around a specific event, such as a book launch or [[vernissage]].  Wine, beer, and cocktails are served along with finger foods and other [[hors d'oeuvres]]. Such a party held later may be named for the specific time (e.g. ''{{lang|fr|six à huit}}).''

A ''{{lang|fr|cinq à sept}}'' can be a formal gathering held in a wide range of public and private spaces, such as [[art galleries]], [[University]] campuses, and places of work, but it is also commonly used more informally as a promotion in [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s to attract patrons.&lt;ref&gt;http://montreal.about.com/od/montreal-words-expressions/qt/5-a-7-montreal-happy-hour-expressions-french-quebec-words.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The English equivalent might be a "wine and cheese" gathering in the more formal usage or "[[happy hour]]" in the informal usage.

=== In France ===
''{{lang|fr|Cinq à sept}}'' originally referred to a time for a [[wikt:tryst|tryst]], and consequently a [[metonymy]] for visit to one's mistress, an [[Extramarital sex|affair]], and the mistress (or lover) involved. It derived from the time of day French men would make such a visit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843018,00.html "Love in the Afternoon," Time Magazine, November 11, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; It is still commonly considered today as the moment of the day to meet one's mistress or lover, and the term is understood with a sexual content (as opposed to Quebec habit).

{{LGBT sidebar}}

'''''Closeted''''' and '''''in the closet''''' are adjectives for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transgender]] etc. ([[LGBTQ+]]) people who have not disclosed their [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]] and aspects thereof, including [[sexual orientation identity|sexual identity]] and [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]]. It can also be used to describe anyone who is hiding part of their identity because of social pressure.

==Background==
In late 20th-century America, the closet had become a central metaphor for grasping the history and social dynamics of gay life. The notion of the closet is inseparable from the concept of [[coming out]]. The closet narrative sets up an implicit dualism between being "in" or being "out". Those who are "in" are often stigmatized as living false, unhappy lives.&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, Meeks, and Traschen (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; However, though many people would prefer to be “out” of the closet, there are numerous social, economic, familial, and personal repercussions that lead to them remaining, whether consciously or unconsciously, “in” the closet. The decision to come out or remain in the closet is considered a deeply personal one, and [[outing]] remains controversial in today’s culture.

In the 21st century, the related concept of a "glass closet" emerged in LGBT discourse.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/2008/09/22/glass-closet|title=The Glass Closet|date=2008-09-23|website=www.out.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term describes public figures, such as entertainers or politicians, who are out of the closet in their personal lives and do not engage in the tactics (such as entering a [[lavender marriage]] or publicly dating a person of the opposite sex as a "beard") that were historically used by closeted celebrities to disguise their sexual identity, but have not formally disclosed their sexual orientation on the public record — and who, thus, are technically neither fully in the closet nor fully out of it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Effects==

In the early stages of the lesbian, gay or bisexual identity development process, people often feel confused and experience turmoil. In 1993, [[Michelangelo Signorile]] wrote ''Queer in America'', in which he explored the harm caused both to a closeted person and to society in general by being closeted.&lt;ref&gt;re-released in 2003 by University of Wisconsin Press, {{ISBN|0-299-19374-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seidman, Meeks, and Traschen (1999) argue that "the closet" may be becoming an antiquated metaphor in the lives of modern-day Americans for two reasons.
# Homosexuality is becoming increasingly normalized and the shame and secrecy often associated with it appear to be in decline.
# The metaphor of the closet hinges upon the notion that [[stigma management]] is a way of life. However, stigma management may actually be increasingly done situationally.

The closet, however, is difficult for any [[non-heterosexual]], non-[[cisgender]] identified person to fully come "out" of, whether or not that person desires to do so. Scholar [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], author of the ''[[Epistemology of the Closet]]'', discusses the difficulty with the closet: {{cquote|...the deadly elasticity of heterosexist presumption means that, like Wendy in [[Peter Pan]], people find new walls springing up around them even as they drowse: every encounter with a new classful of students, to say nothing of a new boss, social worker, loan officer, landlord, doctor, erects new closets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sedgwick|first=Eve Kosofsky|title=The Epistemology of the Closet}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Recent attention to bullying of LGBTQ youth and teens in the United States gives an indication that many youth and teens remain closeted throughout their educational years and beyond for fear of disapproval from parents, friends, teachers, and community members. To remain in the closet offers an individual a layer of protection against ridicule and bullying.{{cn|date=March 2012}} However to remain in the closet typically takes a toll on the mental health of the individual, especially in the adolescent years as reflected in suicide rates among LGBTQ youths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lambda.org/youth_suicide.htm|title=Generation Q Pride Store brought to you by LAMBDA GLBT Community Services|website=www.lambda.org|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to engineering, '''compartmentalization''' is the general technique of separating two or more parts of a system to prevent [[wikt:malfunction|malfunction]]s from spreading between or among them. This entails the breaking up of a project or problem into sub classes and sub categories, with the intention of simplifying the task at hand, or to efficiently distribute it amongst a number of teams or people.

[[File:Three_decades_x10.png|thumb|Three decades: One thousand 0.001s, one-hundred 0.01s, ten 0.1s, one 1.]]

One '''decade''' (symbol '''dec'''&lt;ref&gt;ISO 80000-3:2006 Quantities and Units – Space and time&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] for measuring [[interval ratio|frequency ratios]] on a [[logarithmic scale]], with one decade corresponding to a ratio of 10 between two frequencies (an [[order of magnitude]] difference).&lt;ref name="Levine"&gt;Levine, William S. (2010). ''The Control Handbook: Control System Fundamentals'', p. 9-29. {{ISBN|9781420073621}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perdikaris"&gt;Perdikaris, G. (1991). ''Computer Controlled Systems: Theory and Applications'', p.117. {{ISBN|9780792314226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially useful when referring to when describing [[frequency response]] of [[electronics|electronic systems]], such as [[audio amplifier]]s and [[electronic filter|filters]].

A closely related unit is the [[octave]], which corresponds to a ratio of 2 between two frequencies.

==Calculations==
The factor-of-ten in a decade can be in either direction: so one decade up from 100&amp;nbsp;Hz is 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz, and one decade down is 10&amp;nbsp;Hz.  The factor-of-ten is what is important, not the unit used, so 3.14&amp;nbsp;rad/s is one decade down from 31.4&amp;nbsp;rad/s.

To determine the number of decades between two frequencies (&lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; &amp; &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt;), use the [[logarithm]] of the ratio of the two values: 
*&lt;math&gt;\log_{10} (f_2/f_1)&lt;/math&gt; decades&lt;ref name="Levine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perdikaris"/&gt;
or, using [[natural logarithm]]s:
*&lt;math&gt;\ln f_2 - \ln f_1\over\ln 10&lt;/math&gt; decades&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Don and Patronis, Eugene (2012). ''Sound System Engineering'', p.13. {{ISBN|9780240808307}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:How many decades is it from 15&amp;nbsp;rad/s to 150,000&amp;nbsp;rad/s?
::&lt;math&gt;\log_{10} (150000/15) = 4&lt;/math&gt; dec
:How many decades is it from 3.2&amp;nbsp;GHz to 4.7&amp;nbsp;MHz?
::&lt;math&gt;\log_{10} (4.7\times10^6 / 3.2\times10^9 ) = -2.83&lt;/math&gt; dec
:How many decades is one octave?
::One octave is a factor of 2, so &lt;math&gt;\log_{10} (2) = 0.301&lt;/math&gt; decades per octave (decade = [[just major third]] + three octaves, 10/1 ({{audio|Decade on A.mid|Play}}) = 5/4)

To find out what frequency is a certain number of decades from the original frequency, multiply by appropriate powers of 10:
:What is 3 decades down from 220&amp;nbsp;Hz?
::&lt;math&gt;220 \times 10^{-3} = 0.22&lt;/math&gt; Hz
:What is 1.5 decades up from 10?
::&lt;math&gt;10 \times 10^{1.5} = 316.23&lt;/math&gt;

To find out the size of a step for a certain number of frequencies per decade, raise 10 to the power of the inverse of the number of steps:
:What is the step size for 30 steps per decade?
::&lt;math&gt; 10^{1/30} = 1.079775&lt;/math&gt; – or each step is 7.9775% larger than the last.

==Graphical representation and analysis==
[[Image:Decade vs Linear.svg|400px|1,10,100,1k,10k,100k using decades vs. 0,10,20,30,40,50 using linear scale]]

Decades on a logarithmic scale, rather than unit steps (steps of 1) or other [[linear]] scale, are commonly used on the horizontal axis when representing the frequency response of electronic circuits in graphical form, such as in [[Bode plot]]s, since depicting large frequency ranges on a linear scale is often not practical. For example, an [[audio amplifier]] will usually have a frequency band ranging from 20 Hz to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz and representing the entire band using a decade log scale is very convenient. Typically the graph for such a representation would begin at 1 Hz (10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) and go up to perhaps 100&amp;nbsp;kHz (10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;), to comfortably include the full audio band in a standard-sized [[graph paper]], as shown below.  Whereas in the same distance on a linear scale, with 10 as the major step-size, you might only get from 0 to 50.

[[Image:Butterworth filter bode plot.svg|350px|thumb|right|[[Bode plot]] showing the concept of a decade: each major division on the horizontal axis is one decade]]

Electronic frequency responses are often described in terms of "per decade".  The example Bode plot shows a slope of −20&amp;nbsp;[[Decibel|dB]]/dec in the stopband, which means that for every factor-of-ten increase in frequency (going from 10 rad/s to 100 rad/s in the figure), the gain decreases by 20&amp;nbsp;dB.

The '''Walk to Freedom''' was a mass march during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] on June 23, 1963 in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. It drew crowds of an estimated 125,000 or more and was known as "the largest civil rights demonstration in the nation's history" up to that date.  
 
Various ministers and leaders of local and national organizations including the Mayor of Detroit were in attendance and gave speeches. Among them was [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] who after the Walk to Freedom March gave an impassioned speech. It was a precursor to his famous "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech given weeks later in [[Washington, D.C.]]. The march itself was, to King and his supporters, partly a practice run of the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]].&lt;ref name=Sugrue&gt;{{cite book|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas J.|title=Sweet Land of Liberty: The Forgotten Struggle for Civil Rights in the North|year=2008|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780679643036|pages=298–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the greater size of the March on Washington, the Detroit Walk to Freedom has been somewhat lost to obscurity outside of local Detroit history.&lt;ref name="Freedom North"&gt;{{cite book|title=Freedom North: Black Freedom Struggles Outside the South, 1940-1980|year=2003|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780312294670|pages=166–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Dr. King called it "one of the most wonderful things that has happened in America."&lt;ref name=Reuther&gt;{{cite web|title=Detroit's Walk to Freedom|url=https://www.reuther.wayne.edu/node/7858|work=Walter P. Reuther Library|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

Reverend [[Clarence L. Franklin]] and Reverend [[Albert Cleage]] were Civil Rights leaders who, although they had very different viewpoints and methods of tackling injustice, came together and proposed the idea of having a large march or demonstration in Detroit.&lt;ref name=Joseph&gt;{{cite book|last=Joseph|first=Peniel E.|authorlink=Peniel E. Joseph|title=Waiting 'Til the Midnight Hour: A Narrative History of Black Power in America|year=2006|publisher=Henry Holt and Co.|isbn=9780805075397|pages=75–76, 81–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together along with other organizers, they formed the Detroit Council for Human Rights which would be the organization that would actually put on the Walk to Freedom march.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt; Cleage originally wanted the march to be all black and led by blacks only; however, the local Detroit branch of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) was prepared to not support the march and even boycott it if the DCHR did not include some local white leaders in the march.&lt;ref name="Freedom North" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sugrue /&gt;   Although the march was open to all, the vast majority that came to the march were African-American, but there were several prominent whites, such as the [[Mayor of Detroit, Michigan|Mayor of Detroit]] [[Jerome Cavanagh]], who joined in leading the march or otherwise showed their support.&lt;ref name=Sugrue /&gt;

== Purpose ==

The Walk to Freedom had two main purposes. The first and main purpose of the march "… was to speak out against segregation and the brutality that met civil rights activists in the South while at the same time addressing concerns of African Americans in the urban North: inequality in hiring practices, wages, education, and housing."&lt;ref name="Reuther"/&gt;  The second purpose of the march was to raise funds and awareness for the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), which was an organization that did civil rights work in the south.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt; The date that was picked to be when the march would take place, June 23, was to honor the 20th anniversary of [[Detroit race riot of 1943]] in which over two dozen people were killed and many more injured.&lt;ref name=Reuther /&gt;

== The March ==

=== Who Marched ===

Many prominent people, known locally and nationally, lead the Walk to Freedom. From the Detroit Council for Human Rights: Rev. C. L. Franklin, father of famous singer [[Aretha Franklin]] and was chairman of the DCHR;  Rev. Albert Cleage, who was a part of forming the DCHR; and Benjamin McFall, director of the DCHR. The former [[Governor of Michigan]] [[John Swainson]], who was governor from 1961-1962, joined with the Mayor of Detroit Jerome Cavanaugh, and Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;ref name=Garrett&gt;{{cite web|last=Garrett|first=Bob|title=Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Detroit Freedom Walk|url=http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-54463_19313_20652_19271_19357-205425--,00.html|work=michigan.gov|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also leading the march was [[Walter Reuther]], president of the [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW); [[Billie S. Farnum]], who was the State Auditor General.&lt;ref name=Garrett /&gt;  [[George W. Romney|George Romney]], then current Governor of Michigan, was unable to attend the march because it took place on a Sunday and conflicted with his religious practices; however, since Romney fully supported the march and the cause, he sent representatives to walk in his place.&lt;ref name=Romney&gt;{{cite web|title=George Romney — working with Martin Luther King, Jr. for Civil Rights|url=http://www.aboutmittromney.com/romney_and_king.htm|work=aboutMittRomney.com|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Route of the March ===

To generate interest in the Walk to Freedom, stickers, handbills, and other advertisements were spread around the city by event planners.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt;  The march itself started, at about 3pm, on [[Woodward Avenue]] and Adelaide, it continued on Woodward, and then onto Jefferson and concluded at [[Cobo Arena|Cobo Arena and Hall]].&lt;ref name=Reuther /&gt;  Songs were sung, such as "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]", and people carried banners and signs.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrett /&gt;   The whole march only lasted about an hour and a half, but afterwards there were speeches given. At least 125,000 people participated in the march and tens of thousands packed into Cobo Arena and the surrounding area to listen to the speeches.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt;

=== Speeches ===

Many of the leaders of the march gave speeches. Albert Cleage, Walter Reuther, Mayor Cavanagh, former Governor Swainson, Congressman Charles Diggs, a representative of Governor Romney, Martin Luther King Jr., and others all gave speeches to the eager crowds.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuther /&gt;&lt;ref name=Romney /&gt;    The speech spectators were looking forward to the most however was the one given by Martin Luther King Jr., and he obliged them by giving a speech that was as riveting as his speeches always were.

==== Martin Luther King Jr’s Speech ====

Some parts of his Detroit speech are similar to the one he gave in Washington. In particular, the end of his speech was a longer and more detailed version of the legendary "I Have a Dream" portion of his speech given two months later in Washington.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt;

For comparison certain parts of both speeches are alternated below, given on the left is the speech in Detroit at the Walk to Freedom, and given on the right is the speech in Washington.

One of the top record companies of the time, [[Motown]], had asked Martin Luther King Jr. if they could record some of his speeches.&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ward|first=Brian|title=Recording the Dream|year=1998|volume=48|issue=4|url=http://www.historytoday.com/brian-ward/recording-dream}}&lt;/ref&gt; They negotiated to record King’s speech after the Walk to Freedom when everyone gathered at Cobo Arena. King asked in the negotiations that the royalties from sales of the recording go not to him but to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;  That selfless act left a deep impression on [[Berry Gordy]], the founder of Motown, who had been negotiating with King.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;

== Different Names ==

Governor George Romney officially had the day of the Walk to Freedom declared "Freedom March Day in Michigan".&lt;ref name=Garrett /&gt;  There are several different variations of the title "Walk to Freedom" that have been used. Locally in Detroit, it has been known by the title, King’s Walk on Woodward, and the Great March.&lt;ref name=Sugrue /&gt;   Other variations of the title that have been used include, Walk to Freedom March,&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt;  Great March/Walk to Freedom, Walk for/to Freedom, Detroit Freedom Walk/March,&lt;ref name=Garrett /&gt;  and Great March on Detroit.&lt;ref name="Washington Speech" /&gt;

== After the March ==

Although Governor Romney had sent representatives in his place to march in the Walk to Freedom, he wanted to do more than that. A few days after the march, he joined a group of hundreds through [[Grosse Pointe]], a wealthy suburb of Detroit, to advocate for civil rights.&lt;ref name=Romney /&gt;  He was also involved with other marches, rallies, and demonstrations in Michigan and knew Martin Luther King well.&lt;ref name=Romney /&gt; 
The Walk to Freedom, however, did not have the huge impact on Detroit and on civil rights that the March on Washington had and the Detroit Council for Human Rights (DCHR) did not last. The DCHR tried to start up a Northern Christian Leadership Conference as a companion to the SCLC, but disagreements, particularly between Franklin and Cleage, kept the idea from becoming a permanent reality.&lt;ref name="Freedom North" /&gt;   Albert Cleage eventually left the DCHR and it seems that other differences and disagreements caused the DCHR to dissolve.&lt;ref name="Freedom North" /&gt;

== Anniversary ==

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Walk to Freedom a walk was held June 22 of 2013, organised by the Detroit branch of the NAACP and the United Auto Workers. Titled,"We Shall Not Default On Our Freedom!".&lt;ref name=Brand&gt;{{cite news|last=Brand-Williams|first=Oralandar|title=March to mark anniversary of MLK's 'Walk to Freedom'|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130226/METRO/302260349|accessdate=21 April 2013|newspaper=The Detroit News|date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands participated including Martin Luther King III, Detroit Mayor Dave Bing and the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. Unlike 1963's walk's conclusion indoors, the 2013 version concluded at Hart Plaza. Detroit NAACP President Wendell Anthony said the march "signifies that the work for freedom and justice must continue" in Detroit and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Martin Luther King's 1963 Detroit march remembered with walk|url=http://www.clickondetroit.com/community/martin-luther-kings-1963-detroit-march-remembered-with-walk|accessdate=13 July 2016|work=Click on Detroit|publisher=[[WDIV-TV]]|date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mandala of Vajradhatu.JPG|thumb|Tibetan painting of Vajradhatu]]
In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, the '''Diamond Realm''' ([[Sanskrit|Skt.]] वज्रधातु ''vajradhātu'', [[Japanese language|Jp.]] 金剛界 ''kongōkai'') is a metaphysical space inhabited by the [[Five Wisdom Buddhas]].  The Diamond Realm Mandala is based on an esoteric Buddhist [[sutra]] called the [[Vajrasekhara Sutra]].

The Diamond Realm is a very popular subject for [[mandala]]s, and along with the [[Womb Realm]] (''Garbhakosa'') Mandala forms the [[Mandala of the Two Realms]].  This mandala, along with the Womb Realm, form the core of Japanese esoteric, or [[Shingon]] Buddhist, rituals, including the initiation or [[abhisheka]] ritual. In this ritual, new initiates are blindfolded, and are asked to toss a flower upon a mandala. Where the flower lands helps decide which Buddhist figure the student should devote themselves to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hakeda | first = Yoshito S. | title = Kūkai and His Major Works | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-231-05933-7 | pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional [[Shingon]] Buddhist halls, the Diamond Realm Mandala is hung on the west wall symbolizing the final realization of [[Vairocana|Mahāvairocana]] Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hakeda | first = Yoshito S. | title = Kūkai and His Major Works | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-231-05933-7 | pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this setting, the Womb Realm Mandala is hung on the east wall, symbolizing the young stage of [[Vairocana|Mahāvairocana]] Buddha.

[[Image:Zinc-finger-dot-plot.png|thumb|right|upright=1.4|A [[DNA]] dot plot of a [[human]] [[zinc finger]] [[transcription factor]] (GenBank ID NM_002383), showing regional [[self-similarity]]. The main diagonal represents the [[sequence alignment|sequence's alignment]] with itself; lines off the main diagonal represent similar or repetitive patterns within the sequence.]]
In [[bioinformatics]] a '''dot plot''' is a graphical method for comparing two [[Sequence (biology)|biological sequences]] and identifying regions of close similarity. It is a type of [[recurrence plot]].

==History==
One way to visualize the similarity between two protein or nucleic acid sequences is to use a similarity matrix, known as a dot plot. These were introduced by Gibbs and McIntyre in 1970&lt;ref name="gibbs-mcintyre"/&gt; and are two-dimensional matrices that have the sequences of the proteins being compared along the vertical and horizontal axes. For a simple visual representation of the similarity between two sequences, individual cells in the matrix can be shaded black if residues are identical, so that matching sequence segments appear as runs of diagonal lines across the matrix.

== Interpretation ==
Some idea of the similarity of the two sequences can be gleaned from the number and length of matching segments shown in the matrix. Identical proteins will obviously have a diagonal line in the center of the matrix. Insertions and deletions between sequences give rise to disruptions in this diagonal. Regions of local similarity or repetitive sequences give rise to further diagonal matches in addition to the central diagonal. One way of reducing this noise is to only shade runs or '[[tuple]]s' of residues, e.g. a tuple of 3 corresponds to three residues in a row. This is effective because the probability of matching three residues in a row by chance is much lower than single-residue matches.

Dot plots compare two sequences by organizing one sequence on the x-axis, and another on the y-axis, of a plot. When the residues of both sequences match at the same location on the plot, a dot is drawn at the corresponding position. Note, that the sequences can be written backwards or forwards, however the sequences on both axes must be written in the same direction. Also note, that the direction of the sequences on the axes will determine the direction of the line on the dot plot. Once the dots have been plotted, they will combine to form lines. The closeness of the sequences in similarity will determine how close the diagonal line is to what a graph showing a curve demonstrating a [[direct relationship]] is. This relationship is affected by certain sequence features such as frame shifts, direct repeats, and inverted repeats. Frame shifts include insertions, deletions, and mutations. The presence of one of these features, or the presence of multiple features, will cause for multiple lines to be plotted in a various possibility of configurations, depending on the features present in the sequences. A feature that will cause a very different result on the dot plot is the presence of low-complexity region/regions. [[Low-complexity regions]] are regions in the sequence with only a few amino acids, which in turn, causes redundancy within that small or limited region. These regions are typically found around the diagonal, and may or may not have a square in the middle of the dot plot.

'''Arizona Proposition 203''', also known as '''English for the Children''', is a ballot initiative that was passed by 63% of Arizona voters on November 7, 2000. It limited the type of instruction available to English language learner (ELL) students. Before Proposition 203, schools were free in terms of ELL instruction to use bilingual or immersion methods. According to a cover letter from the Arizona Department of Education Superintendent of Public Instruction [[Lisa Graham Keegan]] to the Arizona Legislature, it was impossible to make a correct analysis regarding how many students were learning through English as a second language programs, as opposed to bilingual education. The school districts had submitted "conflicting information," and 40% had not submitted any data, in spite of three deadline extensions. &lt;ref&gt;Lisa Graham Keegan, "English Acquisition Services: A Summary of Bilingual Programs and English as a Second Language Programs for School Year 1997-8," ''Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction to the Arizona Legislature,'' January 1999, cover letter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposition 203, like the similar California Proposition 227, was named after its financial supporter Ron Unz, a [[Silicon Valley]] software entrepreneur.  61% of the voters had passed Proposition 227. Arizona, Massachusetts, and Colorado followed with similar campaigns directed by Unz. On November 5, 2002, Question 2 in Massachusetts was passed by 68% of the voters, but Amendment 31 in Colorado was rejected by 56% of the voters. Unz's goal was to replace bilingual education with structured or sheltered English immersion programs.  The book ''English for the Children: Mandated by the People, Skewed by Politicians and Special Interests'' by Johanna J. Haver (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education, 2013) reconstructs the politics surrounding Unz's movement and its effects on the education of ELLs.

==Content==
The actual text of the legislation begins with declarations regarding the importance of English and learning English. It goes on to state that immigrant parents want their children to acquire "a good knowledge of English," allowing them to "fully participate in the American dream." It explains that the government and Arizona public schools have a moral responsibility to "provide all of Arizona's children... with the skills necessary to become productive members of our society." It elaborates that public schools "currently do an inadequate job of educating immigrant children" by "experimental language programs whose failure over the past two decades is demonstrated by the current high drop-out rates and low English literacy levels of many immigrant children." It makes the point that "young immigrant children can easily acquire full fluency in a new language, such as English, if they are heavily exposed to that language in the classroom at an early age." &lt;ref&gt;Maria Mendoza and Hector Ayala, "English Language Education for Children in Public Schools, AZ Prop 203," January 6, 1999, English for the Children, www.onenation.org/aztext.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution states that "all children in Arizona public schools shall be taught English as rapidly and effectively as possible." ELLs should be educated in immersion programs during a temporary transition period "not normally intended to exceed one year." A parent may request for his or her child to be exempt if it can be determined that the child already knows English, the child is ten years old or older, or the child is identified as having special needs. However, for a child to claim to have special needs, it must be confirmed that education in English is not the best option for the child.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Mendoza and Hector Ayala, "English Language Education for Children in Public Schools, AZ Prop 203," January 6, 1999, English for the Children, www.onenation.org/aztext.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media coverage ==
[[The New York Times|The ''New York Times'']] ran a front-page story in August prior to the November 2000 election, showing that California's version of the initiative, Proposition 227, had been highly successful, with a rise in standardized test scores among English language learners after two years.&lt;ref&gt; Jacques Steinberg, "Increase in Test Scores Counters Dire Forecasts for Bilingual Ban," August 20, 2000, www.onenation.org/008/082000.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of noted bilingual education theorists' arguments, disputing the particulars of the article, the ''Times'' story is believed to have strongly affected public opinion and the passage of Arizona Proposition 203.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna J. Haver, ''English for the Children'' (Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education, 2013), 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Implementation of the policy was scheduled to occur at the beginning of the 2001-2002 school year. There was widespread confusion throughout the state because of differences of opinion regarding the language used in the text of the proposition. Following the implementation, some schools changed their approach to educating ELLs, but several districts obtained waivers for their ELL students and continued their bilingual education programs. For the most part, neither the bilingual nor the immersion programs were in compliance with the law. Fewer than 11% of the state's ELL students achieved proficiency in a year's time.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, K., Thompson, M., &amp; MacSwan, J. (2004).

Surveys of victims of crime have been undertaken in many cities and countries, using a common [[methodology]] to aid comparability, and have generally included questions on sexual violence. The [[United Nations]] has conducted extensive surveys to determine the level of sexual violence in different societies. According to these studies, the percentage of women reporting having been a victim of sexual assault ranges from less than 2% in places such as [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]] (1.4%), [[Gaborone]], [[Botswana]] (0.8%), [[Beijing]], [[China]] (1.6%), and [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] (0.3%), to 5% or more in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] (6.0%), [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] (5.8%), [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] (8.0%), and [[Bogota]], [[Colombia]] (5.0%).&lt;ref&gt;The international crime victim survey in countries in transition: national reports. Rome, United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victims of crime in the developing world. Rome, United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

No distinction has been made in these figures between rape by strangers and that by intimate partners. Surveys that fail to make this distinction or those that only examine rape by strangers usually underestimate substantially the prevalence of sexual violence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jewkes R, Abrahams N. The epidemiology of rape and sexual coercion in South Africa: an overview. Social Science and Medicine (in press).&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from crime surveys, there have been a small number of surveys, with representative samples, that have asked women about sexual violence. For instance, in a national survey conducted in the [[United States of America]], 14.8% of women over 17 years of age reported having been raped in their lifetime (with an additional 2.8% having experienced [[attempted rape]]) and 0.3% of the sample reported having been raped in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Tjaden P, Thoennes N.

of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, United States Department of Justice and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2000 (NCJ 183781).&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of a representative sample of women aged 18– 49 years in three provinces of South Africa found that in the previous year 1.3% of women had been forced, physically or by means of verbal threats, to have non-consensual sex.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In a survey of a representative sample of the general population over 15 years of age in the [[Czech Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weiss P, Zverina J | year = 1999 | title = Experiences with sexual aggression within the general population in the Czech Republic | doi = 10.1023/A:1018740527252 | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 265–269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 11.6% of women reported forced sexual contact in their lifetime, 3.4% reporting that this had occurred more than once. The most common form of contact was forced vaginal intercourse.

===Forced sexual initiation===
A growing number of studies, particularly from [[sub-Saharan Africa]], indicate that the first sexual experience of girls is sometimes unwanted and forced. In a case control study, for example, of 191 [[adolescent]] girls (mean age 16.3 years) attending an [[antenatal]] clinic in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], and 353 non [[pregnant]] adolescents matched for age and neighborhood
or school, 31.9% of the study cases and 18.1% of the controls reported that force was used during their sexual initiation. When asked about the consequences of refusing sex, 77.9% of the study cases and 72.1% of the controls said that they feared being beaten if they refused to have sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jewkes R | year = 2001 | title = Relationship dynamics and adolescent pregnancy in South Africa | url = | journal = Social Science and Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 733–744 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(00)00177-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced sexual initiation and coercion during adolescence have been reported in many studies of young women and men. Where studies have included both men and women in the sample, the prevalence of reported rape or sexual coercion has been higher among the women than the men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Matasha E | year = 1998 | title = Sexual and reproductive health among primary and secondary school pupils in Mwanza, Tanzania: need for intervention | url = | journal = AIDS Care | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 571–582 | doi=10.1080/09540129848433|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buga GA, Amoko DH, Ncayiyana DJ | year = 1996 | title = Sexual behaviour, contraceptive practice and reproductive health among school adolescents in rural Transkei | url = | journal = South African Medical Journal | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 523–527 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rwenge M.

A portrait of adolescent health in the Caribbean, 2000. Minneapolis, MN, University of Minnesota and Pan American Health Organization, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, nearly half of the sexually active adolescent women in a multi-country study in the [[Caribbean]] reported that their first sexual intercourse was forced, compared with one-third of the adolescent men.&lt;ref&gt;Halco´n L, Beuhring T, Blum R. A portrait of adolescent health in the Caribbean, 2000. Minneapolis,
MN, University of Minnesota and Pan American Health Organization, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lima]], [[Peru]], the percentage of young women reporting forced sexual initiation was almost four times that reported by the young men (40% against 11%, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Caceres CF, Vanoss M, Sid Hudes E | year = 2000 | title = Sexual coercion among youth and young adolescents in Lima, Peru | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 361–367 | doi=10.1016/s1054-139x(00)00096-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are not many studies of forced sexual initiation in the United States, and estimates from the studies that do exist vary widely. One study of 5,663 heterosexual women in the United States found that 12.5% had experienced forced sexual initiation. Of the women who were 15 years old or younger when they had their first sexual experience, 22% reported that those initiations were forced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Campbell|first = Jacquelyn C.|last2 = Lucea|first2 = Marguerite B.|last3 = Stockman|first3 = Jamila K.|last4 = Draughon|first4 = Jessica E.|date = 2013-02-01|title = Forced Sex and HIV Risk in Violent Relationships|journal = American Journal of Reproductive Immunology|language = en|volume = 69|pages = 41–44|doi = 10.1111/aji.12026|pmc = 3573255|pmid = 23066950}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1992 US National Health and Social Life Survey of over 3,400 adults, more than 4% of women reported coerced sexual initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://popcenter.uchicago.edu/data/nhsls.shtml|title=National Health and Social Life Survey {{!}} The University of Chicago|website=popcenter.uchicago.edu|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of over 24,000 women, the World Health Organization found the following rates of women reporting forced sexual initiation: 30% in a Bangladesh province, 24% in a Bangladesh city, 24% in a Peru province, 17% in an Ethiopia province, 17% in a United Republic of Tanzania province, 14% in a United Republic of Tanzania city, 8% in Samoa, 7% in a Peru city, 6% in a Namibia city, 5% in a Brazil province, 4% in a Thailand city, 3% in a Brazil city, 0.7% in a Serbia and Montenegro city, and 0.4% in a Japan city. In all of these sites except Ethiopia, the younger the woman was at the time of her first sexual experience, the more likely it was that that experience was forced sexual initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/67422|title=WHO IRIS: WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women|website=apps.who.int|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gang rape===
{{main article|Gang rape}}
Gang rape, or mass rape, occurs when a group of people participate in the rape of a single victim. Rape involving at least two or more perpetrators is widely reported to occur in many parts of the world.

===Sexual trafficking===
{{Main article|Human trafficking}}

Each year hundreds of thousands of women and girls throughout the world are bought and sold into [[prostitution]] or [[sexual slavery]].&lt;ref name="Migration Information Programme 1995"&gt;Migration Information Programme.

London, Virago Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, the most common destinations for victims of human trafficking are Thailand, Japan, Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Turkey and the United States, according to a report by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC).&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6497799.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in Kyrgyzstan has estimated that around 4,000 people were trafficked from the country in 1999, with the principal destinations being China, Germany, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Of those trafficked, 62% reported being forced to work without pay, while over 50% reported being physically abused or tortured by their employers.&lt;ref&gt;Chauzy JP. Kyrgyzstan Republic: trafficking. Geneva, International Organization for Migration, 20 January 2001 (Press briefing notes).&lt;/ref&gt;

A World Organization against Torture (OMCT) report suggested that more than 200,000 Bangladeshi women had been trafficked between 1990 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Benninger-Budel C et al. Violence against women: a
report. Geneva, World Organization Against Torture, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 200,000 Nepali girls have been trafficked to red light areas of India,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-02/15/content_10821971.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and trafficking of Thai women to Japan has also been reported.&lt;ref name="Dinan K 2000"/&gt; Trafficking of women also takes place internally within some countries, often from rural areas to cities.

In recent years, the problem of human trafficking has gotten very serious in Europe, where women from Eastern Europe, as well as from Asia, Africa and Latin America are trafficked to Western Europe. In Netherlands, it is estimated that there are from 1,000 to 7,000 trafficking victims a year. Most police investigations relate to legal sex businesses, with all sectors of prostitution being well represented, but with window brothels being particularly overrepresented.

All victims from Hungary were female and were forced into prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/local_news/Increase-in-human-trafficking-in-Netherlands_49349.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of all [[Amsterdam]]'s 8,000 to 11,000 prostitutes, more than 75% are from Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia, according to a former prostitute who produced a report about the sex trade in Amsterdam, in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5400641.ece Timesonline.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''Le Monde'' in 1997 found that 80% of prostitutes in the Netherlands were foreigners and 70% had no immigration papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/netherl.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002222727/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/netherl.htm |archivedate=2 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gvnet.com/humantrafficking/Netherlands.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the trafficking of women from Eastern Europe is often organized by people from that same region. The [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|German Federal Police Office]] (BKA) reported in 2006 a total of 357 completed investigations of human trafficking, with 775 victims. Thirty-five percent of the suspects were Germans born in Germany and 8% were German citizens born outside of Germany.&lt;ref name=bka&gt;[https://archive.is/20121217203414/http://www.bka.de/lageberichte/mh.html Reports on human trafficking], by the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]]. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North America is also an important destination for international trafficking. A study undertaken under the auspices of the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] estimated that 45,000 to 50,000 women and children are trafficked annually to the United States.&lt;ref name="Richard AO 1999"&gt;Richard AO. International trafficking in women to the United States: a contemporary manifestation of slavery and organized crime. Washington, DC, Center for the Study of Intelligence, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 150 cases of trafficking were prosecuted between 1996 and 1999 by the [[United States Department of Justice]].&lt;ref name="Richard AO 1999"/&gt; In 2004, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) estimated that 600-800 persons are trafficked into Canada annually and that additional 1,500-2,200 persons are trafficked through Canada into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gvnet.com/humantrafficking/Canada.htm Human Trafficking &amp; Modern-day Slavery - Canada&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
In Canada, foreign trafficking for prostitution is estimated to be worth $400 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unpac.ca/economy/g_migration.html Women &amp; The Economy - Globalization &amp; Migration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514045035/http://www.unpac.ca/economy/g_migration.html |date=14 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual violence against sex workers===
Whether trafficked or not, [[sex workers]] are at high risk for both physical and sexual violence, particularly where sex work is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barnard M | year = 1993 | title = Violence and vulnerability: conditions of work for streetworking prostitutes | url = | journal = Sociology of Health and Illness | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 683–705 | doi=10.1111/1467-9566.ep11434434}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of female sex workers in [[Leeds]], England, and [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, revealed that 30% had been slapped, punched or kicked by a client while working, 13% had been beaten, 11% had been raped and 22% had experienced an attempted rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Church S | year = 2001 | title = Violence by clients towards female prostitutes in different work settings: questionnaire survey | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 322 | issue = | pages = 524–525 | doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7285.524|display-authors=etal | pmid=11230067 | pmc=26557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 34% of those who had suffered violence at the hands of a client reported it to police.

A survey of sex workers in Bangladesh revealed that 49% of the women had been raped and 59% beaten by police in the previous year; the men reported much lower levels of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins C. Street sex workers in Dhaka: their clients and enemies. In:The Proceedings of the International Conference on Violence Against Women and Children, Dhaka, Bangladesh, June 1998. Dhaka, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ethiopia]], a study of sex workers also found high rates of physical and sexual violence from clients, especially against the child sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ayalew T, Berhane Y | year = 2000 | title = Child prostitution: magnitude and related problems | url = | journal = Ethiopian Medical Journal | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 153–163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual violence in schools, health care settings, armed conflicts and refugee settings==

===Schools===
For many young women, the most common place where sexual coercion and harassment are experienced is in school. In an extreme case of violence in 1991, 71 teenage girls were raped by their classmates and 19 others were killed at a boarding school in [[Meru, Kenya|Meru]], [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;Perlez J. For the oppressed sex: brave words to live by. New York Times, 6 June 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; While much of the research in this field comes from Africa, it is not clear whether this reflects a particularly high prevalence of the problem or simply the fact that the problem has had a greater visibility there than in other parts of the world.

Harassment of girls by boys is in all likelihood a global problem.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} In Canada, for example, 23% of girls had experienced sexual harassment while attending school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bagley C, Bolitho F, Bertrand L | year = 1997 | title = Sexual assault in school, mental health and suicidal behaviors in adolescent women in Canada | url = | journal = Adolescence | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 361–366 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research done in Africa, however, has highlighted the role of teachers there in facilitating or perpetrating sexual coercion. A report by Africa Rights &lt;ref&gt;Omaar R, de Waal A. Crimes without punishment: sexual harassment and violence against female students in schools and universities in Africa. African Rights, July 1994 (Discussion Paper No. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; found cases of schoolteachers attempting to gain sex, in return for good grades or for not failing pupils, in the Democratic [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]], [[Somalia]], [[South Africa]], [[Sudan]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. A recent national survey in [[South Africa]] that included questions about experience of rape before the age of 15 years found that schoolteachers were responsible for 32% of disclosed child rapes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In [[Zimbabwe]], a retrospective study of reported cases of child sexual abuse over an 8-year period (1990 to 1997) found high rates of sexual abuse committed by teachers in rural primary schools. Many of the victims were girls between 11 and 13 years of age and penetrative sex was the most prevalent type of sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bagley C, Bolitho F, Bertrand L | year = 1997 | title = Sexual assault in school, mental health and suicidal behaviors inadolescent women in Canada | url = | journal = Adolescence | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 361–366 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care settings===
Sexual violence against patients in health facilities has been reported in many places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fary T, Fisher N | year = 1992 | title = Sexual contact between doctors and patients: almost always harmful | url = | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 304 | issue = | pages = 1519–1520 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lamont JA, Woodward C | year = 1994 | title = Patient–physician sexual involvement: a Canadian survey of obstetriciangynecologists | url = | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 150 | issue = | pages = 1433–1439 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomasson GO | year = 1999 | title = Educating physicians to prevent sexrelated contact with patients | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 281 | issue = | pages = 419–420 | doi=10.1001/jama.281.5.419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dehlendorf CE, Wolfe SM 1998 1883–1888"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dehlendorf CE, Wolfe SM | year = 1998 | title = Physicians disciplined for sex-related offenses | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 279 | issue = | pages = 1883–1888 | doi=10.1001/jama.279.23.1883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McPhedran M | year = 1996 | title = Sexual abuse in the health professions: who's counting? | url = | journal = World Health Statistics Quarterly | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 154–157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silencio y complicidad: violencia contra las mujeres

In [[East Timor]], there were reports of extensive sexual violence against women by the Indonesian military.&lt;ref name="Pacific Women Against Violence 2000"&gt;Pacific Women Against Violence. Violence against East Timor women. Pacific Women’s Network Against Violence Against Women, 2000; 5:1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; A study in [[Monrovia]], [[Liberia]], found that women under 25 years were more likely than those aged 25 years and over to report experiencing attempted rape and sexual coercion during the conflict (18% compared with 4%).&lt;ref name="Swiss S et al. 1998 625–629"/&gt; Women who were forced to cook for a warring faction were at significantly higher risk.

Another inevitable consequence of armed conflicts is the ensuing economic and social disruption which can force large numbers of people into prostitution,&lt;ref name="Pacific Women Against Violence 2000"/&gt; an observation that applies equally to the situation of refugees, whether they are fleeing armed conflicts or natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes or powerful storms.

Refugees fleeing conflicts and other threatening conditions are often at risk of rape in their new setting. Data from the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], for instance, indicated that among the boat people who fled [[Vietnam]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 39% of the women were abducted or raped by pirates while at sea, a figure that is likely to be an underestimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mollica RF, Son L | year = 1989 | title = Cultural dimensions in the evaluation and treatment of sexual trauma: an overview | url = | journal = Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 363–379 | pmid = 2748443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Customary forms of sexual violence==

===Child marriage===
{{main article| Child marriage}}
Marriage is often used to legitimize a range of forms of sexual violence against women. The custom of marrying off young children, particularly girls, is found in many parts of the world. This practice is legal in many countries and is a form of sexual violence, since the children involved are unable to give or withhold their consent. The majority of them know little or nothing about sex
before they are married. They therefore frequently fear it&lt;ref&gt;George A. Sexual behavior and sexual negotiation among poor women and men in Mumbai: an exploratory study. Baroda, Sahaj Society for Health Alternatives, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and their first sexual encounters are
often forced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharma V, Sujay R, Sharma A | year = 1998 | title = Can married women say no to sex? Repercussions of the denial of the sexual act | url = | journal = Journal of Family Welfare | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 1–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early marriage is most common in Africa and South Asia, though it also occurs in the Middle East and parts of Latin America and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="London 2000"&gt;Early marriage: whose right to choose? London, Forum on Marriage and the Rights of Women and Girls, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"&gt;UNICEF Innocenti Research Center. Early marriage: child spouses. Innocenti Digest, 2001, No. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ethiopia]] and parts of West Africa, for instance, marriage at the age of 7 or 8 years is not uncommon. In [[Nigeria]], the mean age at first
marriage is 17 years, but in the [[Kebbi State]] of northern [[Nigeria]], the average age at first marriage is just over 11 years.&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/&gt; High rates of child
marriage have also been reported in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]] and [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name="London 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;100. UNICEF Innocenti Research Center. Early marriage: child spouses. Innocenti Digest, 2001, No. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Asia, child marriage is especially common in rural areas, but exists also in urban areas.&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed EM. Violence against women: the legal system and institutional responses. Lahore, AGHS Legal Aid Cell, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kumari R, Singh R, Dubey A. Growing up in rural India: problems and needs of adolescent girls. New Delhi, Radiant Publishers, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Nepal]], the average age at first marriage is 19 years. Seven per cent of girls, though, are married before the age of 10 years, and 40% by the age of 15 years.&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/&gt; In [[India]], the median age at first marriage for women is 16.4 years. A survey of 5000 women in the [[India]]n state of [[Rajasthan]] found that 56% of the women had
married before the age of 15 years, and of these, 17% were married before they were 10 years old. Another survey, conducted in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]], found that 14% of girls were married between the ages of 10 and 14 years.&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/&gt;

Elsewhere, in Latin America for instance, early age at first marriage has been reported in [[Cuba]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Mexico]] and [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref name="London 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2001"/&gt; In North America and Western Europe, less than 5% of marriages involve girls younger than 19 years of age (for example, 1% in [[Canada]],
[[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]], 2% in [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]], 3% in [[Spain]], and 4% in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Indicators on marriage and marital status. In: 1997 Demographic yearbook, 49th ed. New York, NY,
United Nations Statistics Division, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other customs leading to violence===
In many places, there are customs other than child marriage that result in sexual violence towards women. In [[Zimbabwe]], for instance, there is the custom of ''ngozi'', whereby a girl can be given to a family as [[Blood money (restitution)|compensation for a death]] of a man caused by a member of the girl's family. On reaching puberty the girl is expected to have sexual intercourse with the brother or father of the deceased person, so as to produce a son to replace the one who died. Another custom is ''[[chimutsa mapfiwa]]'', according to which, when a married woman dies, her sister is obliged to replace her in the matrimonial home. [[Widow inheritance]] is or was practised by many cultures; when a man died, his widow was forced to marry one of his brothers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2716">In [[mathematical logic]], '''formation rules''' are rules for describing which [[String (computer science)|strings]] of [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] formed from the [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] of a [[formal language]] are [[syntax (logic)|syntactically]] [[Validity (logic)|valid]] within the language. These rules only address the location and manipulation of the strings of the language. It does not describe anything else about a language, such as its [[semantics]] (i.e. what the strings mean). (See also [[formal grammar]]).

==Formal language==
{{Main|Formal language}}
A ''formal language'' is an organized [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[symbol]]s the essential feature being that it can be precisely defined in terms of just the shapes and locations of those symbols. Such a language can be defined, then, without any [[reference]] to any [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]s of any of its expressions; it can exist before any [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] is assigned to it—that is, before it has any meaning. A [[formal grammar]] determines which symbols and sets of symbols are [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formula]]s in a formal language.

== Formal systems ==
{{main|Formal system}}

A ''formal system'' (also called a ''logical calculus'', or a ''logical system'') consists of a formal language together with a [[deductive apparatus]] (also called a ''deductive system''). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of [[transformation rule]]s (also called ''inference rules'') or a set of [[axiom]]s, or have both. A formal system is used to [[Proof theory|derive]] one expression from one or more other expressions. Propositional and predicate calculi are examples of formal systems.

== Propositional and predicate logic ==
The formation rules of a [[propositional calculus]] may, for instance, take a form such that;

* if we take Φ to be a propositional formula we can also take {{not}}Φ to be a formula;
* if we take Φ and Ψ to be a propositional formulas we can also take (Φ {{and}}  Ψ), (Φ {{imp}}  Ψ), (Φ {{or-}}  Ψ) and (Φ {{eqv}}  Ψ) to also be formulas.

A [[predicate calculus]] will usually include all the same rules as a propositional calculus, with the addition of [[Quantifiers (logic)|quantifiers]] such that if we take Φ to be a formula of propositional logic and α as a [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] then we can take ({{all}}α)Φ and ({{exist}}α)Φ each to be formulas of our predicate calculus.

The '''''Führermuseum''''' ([[English language|English]], '''[[Führer|Leader's]] Museum'''), also referred to as the '''Linz art gallery''', was an unrealized [[art museum]] within a cultural complex planned by [[Adolf Hitler]] for his hometown, the [[Austria]]n city of [[Linz]], near his birthplace of [[Braunau am Inn|Braunau]]. Its purpose was to display a selection of the art bought, [[Nazi plunder|confiscated or stolen by the Nazis]] from throughout [[Europe]] during [[World War II]].  The cultural district was to be part of an overall plan to recreate Linz, turning it into a cultural capital of [[Nazi Germany]] and one of the greatest art centers of Europe, overshadowing [[Vienna]], for which Hitler had a personal distaste.  He wanted to make the city more beautiful than [[Budapest]], so it would be the most beautiful on the [[Danube River]], as well as an industrial powerhouse and a hub of trade; the museum was planned to be one of the greatest in Europe.&lt;ref name=spotts37778&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 377-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=table&gt;{{Cite book |title=[[Hitler's Table Talk|Hitler's Table Talk 1941-1944]] |last1=Hitler | first1=Adolf |authorlink1=Adolf Hitler |others= trans.

The expected completion date for the project was 1950, but neither the ''Führermuseum'' nor the cultural center it was to anchor were ever built.  The only part of the elaborate plan which was constructed was the Nibelungen Bridge, which is still extant.&lt;ref name=prerogative /&gt;

==History and design==
[[File:19091216 berlin kaiser friedrich museum.jpg|thumb|left|325px|The [[Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum]] &amp;ndash; now the Bode Museum &amp;ndash; seen here in 1909, may have influenced Hitler's original design for a "German National Gallery".]]

As early as 1925, Hitler had conceived of a "German National Gallery" to be built in Berlin&lt;ref name=spotts187 /&gt; with himself as director.  His plan, drawn out in a sketchbook, may have been influenced by the [[Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum]], and consisted of a building with two sections, one with 28 rooms and the other with 32.&lt;ref name=spotts187 /&gt; Hitler denoted which of his favorite 19th-century German artists were to be collected, and in what rooms their work would hang. Among his favorite painters were [[Hans Makart]], [[Franz Defregger]], Eduard Grützner, [[Franz von Stuck]], [[Franz von Lenbach]], [[Anselm Feuerbach]], Heinrich Zügel and [[Carl Spitzweg]],&lt;ref name=festface&gt;[[Joachim C. Fest|Fest, Joachim]] and Bullock, Michael (trans.) ''The Face of the Third Reich''. New York: Penguin Books, 1979. p. 97 &amp; p. 543 n.19 {{ISBN|978-0201407143}}.  Originally published 1970;&lt;/ref&gt; and he had extolled "Aryan art" by [[Moritz von Schwind]] and [[Arnold Böcklin]] in ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; At one time in his planning he dedicated five of the rooms in the museum to the work of [[Adolph von Menzel]] and three rooms to both Schwind and Böcklin. [[Carl Rottmann]], Edouard von Engerth, and [[Anton von Werner]] were to share a single room, as were Makart and [[Karl von Piloty]]; [[Wilhelm Trübner]] and [[Fritz von Uhde]]; Grützner and Defregger; and the artists of the [[Nazarene movement]]. Other painters who would enjoy their own room in Hitler's original plans were [[Peter von Cornelius]], [[Hans von Marées]], [[Bonaventura Genelli]], [[Anselm Feuerbach]] and [[Wilhelm Leibl]]. These choices reflected Hitler's taste at the time, which was a preference for sentimental 19th-century Germanic romantic painters,&lt;ref name=spotts194&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Bullock|Bullock, Alan]]. (1963) ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]'' London: Penguin. p. 386. {{ISBN|0-14-013564-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; including "both '[[schmaltz]]y' genre pictures ... [and] heroic, idyllic, allegorical. historical-patriotic themes, the visual equivalent of Wagner, without the genius."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Bullock|Bullock, Alan]]. (1991) ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]'' New York: Knopf. pp. 383-84 {{ISBN|0-394-58601-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was after the ''[[Anschluss]]'' with [[Austria]], with the [[House of German Art]] in Munich already completed, that Hitler conceived of having his dream museum not in any of the premiere cities in Germany, where it could be overshadowed, but in his "hometown" of Linz in Austria, and discussed his plans with the director of the local Provincial Museum, Theodor Kerschner, while visiting there.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 188-89&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, after a state trip to [[Rome]], [[Florence]] and [[Naples]] in 1938 &amp;ndash; between the ''Anschluss'' with Austria and the taking of the [[Sudetenland]] from [[Czechoslovakia]] &amp;ndash;  Hitler, "overwhelmed and challenged by the riches of the Italian museums"&lt;ref name=fest&gt;Fest (1975), pp. 530–531&lt;/ref&gt; expanded the conception of his planned gallery. It would now be the unsurpassed art gallery in all of Europe,&lt;ref name=stern /&gt; indeed "the greatest museum in the world",&lt;ref name=fest /&gt; featuring the finest of all European art.  He conceived that the best of Germanic art would have pride of place in the National Gallery in Berlin, while the new museum in Linz would feature the best of the art of the Mediterranean world, especially from the nineteenth-century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Percy Ernst Schramm|Schramm, Percy Ernst]] (1978) "The Anatomy of a Dictator" in ''Hitler: The Man and the Military Leader''. Detwiler, Donald S., ed. Malabar, Florida: Robert E. Kreiger Publishing Company. p. 64 {{isbn|0-89874-962-X}}; originally published as the introduction to [[Henry Picker|Picker, Henry]] (1963) ''Hitlers Tischgespräche im Führerhauptquarter'' ("[[Hitler's Table Talk]]"}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea and overall design concept for a new cultural district in Linz anchored by the ''Führermuseum'' was Hitler's own. He intended Linz to be one of the future cultural capitals of the Reich,&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; to have its own university,&lt;ref name=festface /&gt; and to overshadow [[Vienna]], a city in which he had spent some years as a struggling artist,&lt;ref name=plaut&gt;Plaut (1946)&lt;/ref&gt; and about which he felt considerable distaste,&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 33–36&lt;/ref&gt; not only because of the Jewish influence on the city, but because of his own failure to gain admission to the [[Vienna Academy of Fine Arts]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Hitler] envisaged Linz as the future seat of the new German ''Kultur'', and lavished all his limited pictorial talent and architectural training on a vast project which would realize this ambition.... [He] devoted a disproportionate amount of time and energy, for a chief of state, to the plans for Linz, personally creating the architectural scheme for an imposing array of public buildings, and setting the formula for an art collection which was to specialize heavily in his beloved, mawkish German school of the nineteenth century. His private library, discovered by the American Army deep in Austria, contained scores of completed architectural renderings for the Linz project...&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to one of Hitler's secretaries, he never tired of talking about his planned museum, and it was often the subject at his regular afternoon teas.  He would expound on how the paintings were to be hung: with plenty of space between them, in rooms decorated with furniture and furnishings appropriate to the period, and how they were to be lit.  No detail of the presentation of the artworks was too small for his consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; He said of the museum in 1942 "Anyone who wants to study nineteenth-century painting will sooner or later find it necessary to go to the Linz gallery, because only there will it be possible to find complete collections."&lt;ref name=spotts218&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and model===

In Autumn 1940, Hitler commissioned architect [[Hermann Giesler]], a devout Nazi,&lt;ref&gt;Sereny (1995), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; to be in overall charge of the rebuilding of Linz,&lt;ref name=kershaw777&gt;Kershaw (2000), pp. 777-778&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sereny (1995), pp. 138, 235&lt;/ref&gt; one of the five designated ''[[Führerstadt|Führerstädte]]'' ("Führer cities"), along with [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Nuremberg]] and [[Munich]], which were to be redeveloped drastically.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; Linz was to become a major cultural center, an art capital of Europe, a hub of trade and commerce, and the most beautiful city on the [[Danube River|Danube]], surpassing [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name=spotts37778 /&gt;&lt;ref name=table /&gt;  It would have a new City Hall, new Nazi Party headquarters and a new railway station, a stadium, a community hall, a technical university, an institute of metallurgy, a planetarium, a suspension bridge, and two new towers, one of them with a [[carillon]] and a [[mausoleum]] for Hitler's parents. The city would also have Hitler's own retirement residence, designed by Giesler. In addition to all this, the Vienna facilities of the Hermann-Göring-Werks steel plant were to be moved to Linz as well, over the objections of officials of the city, the architects, and [[Fritz Todt]], who thought the industrial facilities were incompatible with a city of art, architecture and culture. Hitler, though, wanted to provide the city with an ongoing means of income after he was dead and could no longer subsidize it.&lt;ref name=spotts37476&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 374–76&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural center at the heart of the redevelopment, the buildings for which were based on Hitler's ideas and rough designs, came to be referred to as the "European Culture Center". It included a monumental theatre, a concert hall, a library with over 250,000 volumes, an opera house as well as an operetta house, a cinema, a collection of armor and an Adolf Hitler Hotel, all surrounded by huge boulevards and a parade ground.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Citation|last=Bell|first=Bethany|title=Hitler’s Austrian ‘culture capital’|date=3 November 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7705552.stm|accessdate=13 December 2008 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spotts213&gt;Spotts (20020&lt; p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Located south of the historic section of Linz, the main buildings, including the ''Führermuseum'', were to be aligned along one main avenue, In den Lauben,&lt;ref name=spotts37476 /&gt; which after the war was called "a typical National Socialist axis street."&lt;ref name=prerogative /&gt;  It would be anchored at the other end by the new railway station.&lt;ref name=spotts37476 /&gt;

[[File:Bahnhof der Kaiserin-Elisabeth-Bahn - Linz.jpg|thumb|right|287px|Linz's original central [[station building]] where the ''Führermuseum'' was intended to be located; the station would be moved four miles south]]

The design of the many buildings of the cultural center were assigned to various architects Hitler favored.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 213-14; 343&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum itself was designed by [[Roderich Fick]]&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002) p. 214. Spotts refutes other sources, including [[Gitta Sereny]] (1995, p. 718), who report that [[Albert Speer]] was the designer, saying that "Speer had no role in Linz, despite desperate attempts to insert himself."&lt;/ref&gt; based closely on Hitler's sketches and specifications, modeled somewhat after [[Paul Ludwig Troost]]'s ''[[House of German Art|Haus der Deutschen Kunst]]'' ("House of German Art") in [[Munich]] &amp;ndash; itself strongly influenced by Hitler's participation in the design process&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; and would feature a colonnaded facade about 500 feet (150 meters) long. It would stand on the site of the [[Linz Hauptbahnhof|Linz railroad station]], which was to be moved four kilometers to the south.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;ref name="intelligent-TV"&gt;{{Citation|title= Hitler’s Museum|url= http://www.intelligenttelevision.com/index.php/site/production/hitlers-museum/| accessdate=13 December 2008|website=Intelligent Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Should the volume of German art bought, confiscated and plundered for the museum be such that expansion was needed, an additional building could easily be integrated into the planned district.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;

By January 1945, Hitler became obsessed with seeing a model of the planned cultural complex; he had his adjutants and [[Martin Bormann]], his personal secretary and head of the [[Nazi Party Chancellery]], call Giesler's office repeatedly, to ask when the Führer could view the model.  Giesler's office worked around the clock to finish it. The model was finally set up in the cellar of the new [[Reich Chancellery]], and was ready for viewing on 9 February,&lt;ref name=kershaw777 /&gt; when it was examined by Hitler, [[Robert Ley]], the Leader of the German Labor Front, and SS-''Oberguppenfūhrer'' [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], Chief of the Security Police, along with Hitler's personal photographer [[Walter Frentz]] and his valet, [[Heinz Lange]].&lt;ref name=lastdays84&gt;[[Anton Joachimsthaler|Joachimsthaler, Anton]] (1996) ''The Last Days of Hitler: The Legends, the Evidence, the Truth''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bent over the model, he viewed it from all angles, and in different kinds of lighting.  He asked for a seat.  He checked the proportions of the different buildings.  He asked about the details of the bridges.  He studied the model for a long time, apparently lost in thought.  While Geisler stayed in Berlin, Hitler accompanied him twice daily to view the model, in the afternoon and again during the night.  Others in his entourage were taken down to have his building plans explained to them as they pored over the model. Looking down on the model of a city which, he knew, would never be built, Hitler could fall in reverie, revisiting the fantasies of his youth, when he would dream with his friend Kubizek about rebuilding Linz.&lt;ref name=kershaw777 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hitler visited the model frequently during his time living in the bunker under the Reich Chancellery, spending many hours sitting silently in front of it.&lt;ref name=lastdays84 /&gt; The closer Germany came to military defeat, the more viewing the model became Hitler's only relief; being invited to view it with him was an indication of the Führer's esteem.&lt;ref name="spotts37778"/&gt;

Near the end of the war, when American forces overran Hitler's private library, which was hidden deep in Austria, it contained "scores" of plans and renderings for the museum and the complex. They also found ''The Future Economic Status of the City of Linz'' a 78-page bound volume prepared for Hitler by the  Economic and Research Section of the Oberdonau Department of the Interior, which outlined in detail how the revitalization of Linz would take place. The entire Linz project was treated as a state secret on Hitler's order.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;

==Collection==
The collection for the planned museum in Linz was accumulated through several methods.  Hitler himself sent [[Heinrich Heim]], one of Martin Bormann's adjutants who had expertise in paintings and graphics, on trips to Italy and France to buy artworks, which Hitler paid for with his own money, which came from sales of ''Mein Kampf'', real estate speculation on land in the area of [[Berghof (residence)|the ''Berghof'']], Hitler's mountain retreat on the [[Obersalzberg]], and royalties from Hitler's image used on postage stamps.&lt;ref&gt;Sereny (1995), p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, which was divided with his official photographer [[Heinrich Hoffmann (photographer)|Heinrich Hoffmann]], amounted to at least $75 million marks{{clarify|date=September 2018}} over the course of Hitler's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

This, however, was not the primary method used to build up the collection.

===Hitler's birthday===
In Nazi Germany, Hitler's birthday was celebrated nationally on April 20 beginning in 1933, the year Hitler became Chancellor, through 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Kershaw|Kershaw, Ian]]. ''The "Hitler Myth": Image and Reality in the Third Reich'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987. pp. 57-59, 64, 72, 79, 141, 151, 159, 197-98, 213-14. {{ISBN|0-19-282234-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his [[Adolf Hitler's 50th Birthday|50th birthday in 1939]], the day was declared a National Holiday. As part of these celebrations Hitler would receive numerous presents, among which were paintings and other art objects.  These were set aside for use in the planned ''Führermuseum'' in Linz.&lt;ref name=stern&gt;[[J. P. Stern|Stern, J. P.]] ''Hitler: The Führer and the People'' Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1992. p. 71.  {{ISBN|0-520-02952-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler's 56th birthday in 1945 was a private celebration held in the bunker under the Reich Chancellery in Berlin as the Soviet [[Red Army]] battled to take the city; even under those circumstances, Hitler would frequently spend hours in the basement of the Chancellery looking at the scale model of the proposed rebuilding of Linz, which centered on the cultural district around the ''Fŭhrermuseum''.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw (2000), pp. 777-78&lt;/ref&gt; Nine days after his birthday, Hitler married [[Eva Braun]], and they committed suicide together the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw (2000), pp. 820-1; 828&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Führer-Reserve''===

In the first weeks after the Anschluss in March 1938, which brought Austria into the German Reich, both the [[Gestapo]] and the [[Nazi Party]] confiscated numerous artworks for themselves.  In response, on 18 June 1938, Hitler issued a decree placing all artwork that had been seized in Austria under the personal prerogative of the Führer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As part of the seizure of assets hostile to the state– especially Jewish assets – in Austria, paintings and other artwork of great value, among other things, have been confiscated. The Führer requests that this artwork, for the most part from Jewish hands, be neither used as furnishings of administration offices or senior bureaucrats’ official residences nor purchased by leading state and party leaders. The Führer plans to personally decide on the use of the property after its seizure. He is considering putting artwork first and foremost at the disposal of small Austrian towns for their collections.&lt;ref&gt;Decree issued by Reich Minister and Head of the Chancellery of the Reich, June 18, 1938. Vienna, Federal Office for the Protection of Monuments, archive, restitution files, box 8/1, fascicle 1. As facsimile in: Theodor Brückler (publ.), Kunstraub, Kunstbergung und Restitution in Österreich 1938 bis heute, Vienna-Cologne-Weimar, 1999, at 157. quoted in [https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114537/http://www.artrestitution.at/F.prerogative.html "The Führer’s prerogative and the planned Führer Museum in Linz"] Art Database of the National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The intent of the order was to guarantee that Hitler would have first choice of the plundered art for his planned ''Führermuseum'' and for other museums in the Reich.&lt;ref name=prerogative&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114537/http://www.artrestitution.at/F.prerogative.html "The Führer’s prerogative and the planned Führer Museum in Linz"] Art Database of the National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz (2004), pp. 83-110.&lt;/ref&gt;  This later became a standard procedure for all purloined or confiscated art, and was known as the "''Führer-Reserve.''"&lt;ref name=spotts198&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sonderauftrag Linz''===

On 21 June 1939, Hitler set up the ''Sonderauftrag Linz'' ("Special Commission: Linz") in [[Dresden]] and appointed [[Hans Posse]], director of the ''[[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]]'' ("Dresden Painting Gallery"), as a special envoy. A few days later, on 26 June, Hitler signed a letter intended to give Posse the authority he would need to do this job.  He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I commission Dr. Hans Posse, Director of Dresden Gallery, to build up the new art museum for Linz Donau.  All Party and State services are ordered to assist Dr. Posse in fulfillment of his mission.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1994-006-28A, Dr. Hans Posse crop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|[[Hans Posse]] in 1938]]

Posse had a checkered relationship with the National Socialists. His wife had joined the Nazi Party in 1932, but when Posse himself tried to join in 1933, his application was rejected a year later. He was later accused of having promoted so-called "[[Degenerate art]]", and of having Jewish ancestry. In 1938 he was asked to resign as director &amp;ndash; a position he had held since 1910 from the age of 31 &amp;ndash; but refused, taking a leave of absence instead. He was nevertheless fired, only to be restored to the position on Hitler's orders, possibly through the influence of art dealer [[Karl Haberstock]].&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 189-191&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hitler had favored German and Austrian paintings from the 19th century, Posse's focus was on early German, Dutch, French, and Italian paintings.&lt;ref name=history&gt;Enderlein, Angelika; Flacke, Monika and Löhr, Hanns Christian. [http://www.dhm.de/datenbank/linzdb/einleitunge.html "Database on the Sonderauftrag Linz (Special Commission: Linz): History of the Linz collection] [[German Historical Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Posse wrote in his diary that Hitler intended the museum to hold "only the best of all periods from the prehistoric beginnings of art...to the nineteenth century and recent times." Hitler told Posse that he was only to answer to him.&lt;ref name=spotts187&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sonderauftrag'' not only collected art for the ''Führermuseum'', but also for other museums in the German Reich, especially in the eastern territories. The artworks would have been distributed to these museums after the war. The ''Sonderauftrag'' was located in Dresden had approximately 20 specialists attached to it: "curators of paintings, prints, coins, and armor, a librarian, an architect, an administrator, photographers, and restorers."&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; The staff included Robert Oertel and Gottfried Reimer of the Dresden Gallery, Friedrich Wolffhardt, an SS officer, as curator of books and autographs; Leopold Rupprecht of the ''[[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]'' as curator for armour, and Fritz Dworschak, also of that museum, as curator for coins.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 192-93; 212&lt;/ref&gt;

====Under Hans Posse====
On 24 July 1939, [[Martin Bormann]], Deputy Führer [[Rudolf Hess]]'s assistant, informed [[Josef Bürckel]], who Hitler had appointed to head the administration of Austria after the [[Anschluss]], that all artwork which was confiscated was to be made available for examination by Posse or by Hitler personally. Although the order did not originally include the artworks taken earlier from the Vienna [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]], by October Posse had managed to get those included in his remit as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans|Evans, Richard J.]] (2005) ''[[The Third Reich in Power]]''. New York: [[Penguin Books]]. p.662. {{isbn|0-14-303790-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late summer and autumn of that year, Posse traveled a number of times to Vienna to the Central Depot for confiscated art in the Neue Burg to pick out art pieces for the Linz museum,&lt;ref name=prerogative /&gt; and in October he gave to Bormann, for Hitler's approval, the list of artworks confiscated from the Rothschilds which Posse had selected for the museum.   These included works by [[Hans Holbein the Elder]], [[van Dyck]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Gerard ter Borch]] and [[Francesco Guardi]], among others.&lt;ref name=spotts198/&gt; These 182 pieces were also included in Posse's July 1940 list of 324 paintings he had chosen for the museum's collection.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;  

On 13 June 1940, Hitler authorized Posee to travel to Holland, where he had to compete with [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s ERR organization ([[#Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR)|see below]]), [[Kajetan Mǔhllman]], [[Herman Gõring]]'s art curator [[Walter Hofer|Walter Andres Hofer]] and Goring himself in claiming works by Dutch masters, many of which had been purloined, expropriated or confiscated by various Nazi agencies on a number of grounds.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;

Posse went to Poland around November 1940 to examine expropriated artworks there, some of which had been looted by the German Army from museums, palaces and country homes. All of the country's artworks in the German-occupied areas were then cataloged by SS officer and art historian [[Kajetan Mühlmann]], who had done the same previously in Vienna.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;  Posse selected works by [[Leonardo]], [[Raphael]], and [[Rembrandt]] for the museum in Linz, although these pieces never actually left the control of the [[General Government]], the Nazi-occupied rump of Poland left after Germany and the Soviet Union took the territory they wanted.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;

On 10 June 1940, Posse wrote to Bormann:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The special delegate for the safeguarding of art and cultural properties has just returned from Holland. He notified me today that there exists at the moment a particularly favorable opportunity to purchase valuable works of art from Dutch dealers and private owners in German currency. Even though a large number of important works have doubtless been removed recently from Holland, I believe that the trade still contains many objects which are desirable for the Führer's collection, and which may be acquired without foreign exchange.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a result of this, accounts of about 500,000 ''Reichsmarks'' were opened in Paris and Rome for Posse's personal use, and, around July 1940, he expanded the scope of the ''Sonderauftrag Linz'' into [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] when he established an office in [[The Hague]] as ''Referent für Sonderfragen'' (Adviser on "Special Questions"). Posse was able to report to Bormann that as of March 1941 he had spent 8,522,348 ''Reichsmarks'' on artworks for the ''Führermuseum''.  He later bought most of the Mannheimer Collection in 1944, including [[Rembrandt]]'s ''Jewish Doctor'' &amp;ndash; assisted by the threat of confiscation from the Nazi government of [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] &amp;ndash; with the remainder of the collection being purchased in the same manner in France later on.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; The collecting of the ''Sonderauftrag Linz'' includes many such cases of forced sale, using funds from sales of Hitler's book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' and stamps showing his portrait.  Members of the ''Sonderauftrag Linz'' made a considerable number of purchasing trips throughout Europe, acquiring a significant number of artworks, and also arranged purchases through art dealers.&lt;ref name=prerogative /&gt;&lt;ref name="museum-security"&gt;{{Citation|last=Lohr|first=Hanns|title=No Looted Art in Hitler's Museum in Linz|date=20 November 2000|url=http://www.museum-security.org/00/201.html|accessdate=13 December 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521155013/http://www.museum-security.org/00/201.html|archivedate=21 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{Cite news|last=DW Staff|title=The Mystery of Hitler's Lost Art Collection |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=24 August 2008 |url= http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1689856,00.html |accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler was pleased with Posse's work, and in 1940 awarded him the honorific of "Professor",&lt;ref name=spotts193&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; something the Führer did for many of his favorites in the arts, such as [[Leni Riefenstahl]], the actress and film director; architects [[Albert Speer]] and [[Hermann Giesler]]; sculptors [[Arno Breker]] and [[Josef Thorak]]; [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]], conductor of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]]; actor [[Emil Jannings]]; and photographer [[Heinrich Hoffmann (photographer)|Heinrich Hoffmann]]; among others.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anton Joachimsthaler|Joachimsthaler, Anton]] 'ü'The Last Days of Hitler: The Legends, the Evidence, the Truth''. (Helmut Bögler, trans) London: Brockhampton Press, 1999. p. 304 {{ISBN|978-1-86019-902-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1939, Hitler and [[Benito Mussolini]] had made an agreement that any Germanic artworks in public museums in the [[South Tyrol]] &amp;ndash; a traditionally German-speaking area which had been given to Italy after the First World War in return for entering the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente]] &amp;ndash; could be removed and returned to Germany, but when Posse attempted to do so, with the assistance of [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s ''[[Ahnenerbe]]'', the Italians managed to keep putting things off, and no repatriations ever took place.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

Posse died in December 1942 of cancer. His funeral was a high state event to which Hitler invited the directors of all art museums in the Reich; Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] delivered the eulogy, although there was no mention made of the Linz Museum project, since it was a state secret Posse had gathered more than 2500 artworks for the Linz museum in the three years he was head of the ''Sonderauftrag Linz''.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 191; 193&lt;/ref&gt;

====Under Hermann Voss====
In March 1943, [[:de:Hermann Voss (Kunsthistoriker)|Hermann Voss]], an art historian, director of the [[Wiesbaden]] Gallery and former deputy director of the [[Kaiser Friedrich Museum]] in Berlin&lt;ref name=prerogative /&gt; took over the Special Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Birgit. "Sonderauftrag Linz km und „Führermuseum“", in ''Ausst.-Kat. Raub und Restitution'', Berlin: [[Jüdisches Museum Berlin]], 2008. pp. 127–133. {{ISBN|978-3-8353-0361-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His appointment was considered odd by some, since he was known to be an anti-Nazi with a considerable number of Jewish friends and colleagues, but Hitler was known to overlook political factors when dealing with matters of art, and Voss's knowledge of southern German artwork, as well as French and Italian painting, may have decided the matter for him.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref name=spotts192&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Voss was not nearly as active or energetic as Posse had been, and was prone to send out agents rather than to travel himself to make purchases, or to make dealers bring works to him.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;ref name=spotts193 /&gt;

Hitler's relationship with Voss was not as warm as with Posse.  The two men met only on several occasions, and Voss was not given authority over books, armour and coins, as Posse had been.  Voss is said to have remarked after one meeting with the Führer, "He's even worse than I thought."  Voss attempted to mend his fences with Hitler with an elaborate gift for his birthday in 1944, accompanied by a list of his acquisitions in which he claimed to have bought 881 items, compared to 122 paintings that Posse had collected the year before.  Voss did indeed spend money more profligately than Posse had, and his budget was later reduced near the end of the war.&lt;ref name=spotts193/&gt; Under interrogation after the war he claimed to have acquired 3000 painting for the ''Führermuseum'' between 1943 and 1944, although the records do not support this figure, and many of the artworks were of distinctly secondary importance.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;

In April 1943, the German public first heard about the Linz project in a special edition of Heinrich Hoffmann's art magazine ''Kunst dem Volk'' ("Art to the People"). It revealed both the intention to build a great art gallery in Linz and the existence of the collection which had been amassed for it, although, of course, nothing was said about the methods used to acquire many of the pieces. The magazine featured colored plates of works in the collection by [[Rembrandt]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Pieter Breughel the Elder|Breughel]] and [[Vermeer]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002) pp. 193-94&lt;/ref&gt;  Up to that time, only two works which had been collected for the Linz museum had been seen by the public &amp;ndash; but without disclosure of where they were eventually designated to go &amp;ndash; the first was [[Myron]]'s sculpture ''Discobolus'' ("The Discus Thrower"), which Hitler obtained surreptitiously in 1938 through the Berlin State Museum, but ordered to be displayed at the ''Glyptothek'' in Munich, where he proudly told his invited guests at the unveiling "May you all then realize how glorious man already was back then in his physical beauty".  The other work was Makart's triptych ''The Plague in Florence'', which Hitler acquired as a gift from Mussolini, who, when the owners refused to sell it, seized their villa and confiscated the painting, which he presented to the Führer at the train station in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 21; 209&lt;/ref&gt;

====Results====
By December 1944, Posse and Voss had collectively spent 70 million Reichsmarks on accumulating the collection intended for the ''Fuhrermuseum''; although it should be noted that artworks bought in [[Vichy France]] were paid for with francs which were set by the Nazis at an artificially low exchange rate with the Reichmark. In 1945, the count of art items in the collection was over 8,000.&lt;ref name=evans&gt;[[Richard J. Evans|Evans, Richard J.]] (2008) ''[[The Third Reich at War]]''.

====Legal authority====
The legal authority for the collection of artworks for the ''Führermuseum'' began with Hitler himself, who, after the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], had the power to enact laws without involving the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]].  In effect, whatever Hitler directed to be done had the force of law.  It was his personal desire for the creation of a museum and the revitalization of Linz which began the collection program. Martin Bormann, who became chief of the Nazi Party Chancellery and also Hitler's private secretary, was also closely connected to the program from the beginning, in particular as a conduit through which to access Hitler.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; He acted as the Chief of Staff for the ''Sonderauftrag Linz''.&lt;ref name=spotts192 /&gt;

On the next level of hierarchy, Reichsminister [[Hans Lammers]], who was President of the [[Reich Chancellery]], and Helmut von Hummel, Bormann's Special Assistant and "a particularly viscious Nazi", actually drew up the directives which set out the policies and procedures which governed the collecting process, both for confiscations and purchases.  The financing and administration of the Linz program was their responsibility.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; von Hummel had replaced Kurt Hanssen.&lt;ref name=spotts192 /&gt;

Other Nazi officials involved in the confiscation of art, but not specifically with collection for the Linz museum, included the Reich Minister for Science, Education, and Culture, [[Bernhard Rust]]; the Governor General for Poland, [[Hans Frank]]; and Heinrich Himmler, chief of the SS.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

====Photograph albums====

Birgit Schwarz published in 2004 19 photograph albums as documents of the intended gallery holdings. These "Führer albums", which were created between autumn 1940 and autumn 1944, were presented to Hitler every Christmas and on his birthday, 20 April. Originally thirty-one volumes existed, but only nineteen have been preserved in Germany, and 11 are considered to be lost.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; The albums are documents of the intended gallery holdings and are the most important historical and visual sources relating to the gallery of the ''Führermuseum''.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Birgit. "Hitler's Museum", in ''Vitalizing Memory''. Washington: International Perspectives on Provenance Research, 2005, S. pp. 51-54&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the collection included three Rembrandts, ''La Danse'' by [[Watteau]], the Memling portrait by Corsini, the [[Rubens]] ''Ganymede'', and [[Vermeer]]'s ''The Artist in His Studio'', a forced sale at a knock-down price.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2005-0168, Alfred Rosenberg.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Alfred Rosenberg]]]]

===''Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg'' (ERR)===
In the "authoritarian anarchy"&lt;ref&gt;Fest (1975), p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; and "administrative chaos"&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw (2000), p. 569&lt;/ref&gt; that was typical of the way the Third Reich operated, the ''Sonderauftrag Linz'' was not the only Nazi agency collecting artworks. In France, as in [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|many other countries in Europe]], the office of ''[[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]]'' (Special Purposes Reich Leader Rosenberg) was the primary agency.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; On 5 November 1940, a directive from ''Reichsmarchall'' [[Hermann Göring]] to [[Alfred Rosenberg]], the head of the ERR, and to the Chief of Military Administration in Paris outlines the several categories of "ownerless" art confiscated from Jews for "safeguarding".  One of the categories were "Those art objects for the further disposition of which the Führer has reserved for himself the right of decision," while other categories were those works desired by Göring himself, those destined for German museums other than the ''Führermuseum''.  Although the directive was intended to be effective immediately, Göring indicates that he had yet to clear it with Hitler, but intended to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler then issued on 18 November his own directive, a ''Führerbefehl'' similar to the ones he had issued for Poland and Austria, announcing his prerogative over all confiscated art in the occupied Western territories. Rosenberg thus became a formal procurement agent for the ''Führermuseum'', except when Göring intervened.  This apparently brought about some internecine squabbling, as Dr. Posse had been given the authority to act on Hitler's behalf, and the German commanders of occupied countries were required to keep him regularly informed about their confiscations of artwork. Probably because of Göring's interference, Posse formally requested that the Reich Chancellery reiterate his power to act for the ''Führer''.  The result was a "general high-level directive" confirming Hitler's primacy through Posse, and a direction to Posse to review the ERR's inventory in regard to the needs of the planned museum in Linz.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;

On 20 March 1941, Rosenberg reported that his unit had proceeded to follow the directive, having "collected" over 4000 items; those personally selected by Göring had already been shipped by train to the air-raid shelters of the Führer Building in Munich.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt;  Several years later, on 16 April 1943, Rosenberg sent Hitler photographs of some of the more valuable paintings confiscated from the Western Occupied Territories, to add to the 53 photographs he had sent earlier.  Rosenberg asked for permission to see Hitler personally, to present a catalog of works seized, as well as 20 additional folders of photographs.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

By one conservative estimate, about 21,903 objects were confiscated from France.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Burleigh|Burleigh. Michael]] ''Moral Combay: Good and Evil in World War II'' New York: Harper, 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-06-058097-1}}. p.211&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, about 700 went to Göring. 53 were earmarked for the Führermuseum in Linz.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; Rosenberg kept the rest under his own control until 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.zikg.eu/forschung/redaktion-kunstchronik/inhaltsverzeichnisse/pdf/heft-1-januar-2016-1|title = Neufund, Ein neues Dokument zum "Sonderauftrag Linz|last = Loehr|first = Hanns Christian|date = 4 January 2016|journal = Kunstchronik|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[German Historic Museum]] of Berlin published a database&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhm.de/datenbank/linzdb/indexe.html "Database on the Sonderauftrag Linz (Special Commission: Linz)"] [[German Historic Museum|Deutsches Historisches Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; with paintings collected for the ''Führermuseum'' and for other museums in the German Reich.

====Wolff-Metternich, Jaujard and Valland====
The German occupation of [[Paris]] began on 14 June 1940, and on 30 June Hitler ordered that artworks in the French national collection be "safeguarded", and in particular "ownerless" art and historical documents &amp;ndash; meaning works which were the property of Jews and could therefore be confiscated from them &amp;ndash; be "protected" as well. Three days later, the German ambassador in France, [[Otto Abetz]], ordered the confiscation of the collections of the 15 most important art dealers in the city, most of whom were Jewish.  These pieces were then brought to the German Embassy.  Through the actions of Count Franz von Wolff-Metternich, the head of the ''[[Kunstschutz]]'' (Art Protection) &amp;ndash; an agency which dated from [[World War I]] and which had a mission which was superficially similar to that of the Allied [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] (MFAA) &amp;ndash; Nazi military authorities intervened and stopped Abetz from making any more confiscations.  Most of the artwork in the Embassy was then transferred for storage to the [[Louvre]], at the suggestion of [[Jacques Jaujard]], the Director of French National Museums.&lt;ref name=wolff&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 126-130&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolff-Metternich continued in his efforts to protect the artworks, which what he saw as the proper role of his agency.  In particular, he was able to fend off [[Joseph Goebbels]]' demand that almost a thousand pieces of "Germanic" art held in the collection of confiscated pieces be shipped immediately to Germany.  Wolff-Metternich did not disagree that the artworks properly belonged in the Reich, but did not think that sending them at the time was the correct course of action, and held off Goebbels with bureaucratic maneuvers and a strict interpretation of Hitler's directive, which specified that artwork in France should not be moved until a peace treaty between France and German had been signed, which had not as yet occurred.&lt;ref name=wolff /&gt;

The collection of artwork in the Louvre was destined to survive the war, and was not subjected to predation from the various Nazi entities confiscating and collecting artwork for shipment back to Germany, including those doing so for Hitler's planned museum in Linz.  Wolff-Metternich was eventually removed from his office, as he was not pliable enough to provide the veneer of legality that was wanted by the Nazi authorities.  Jaujard was fired as well after his vehement protest over the German theft of the [[Ghent Altarpiece]] in 1942, but when the staffs of every French museum resigned in protest over his dismissal, the Nazis were forced to restore him to his office, where he was able to continue to safeguard the French national collection, and provide assistance to the [[French Resistance|Resistance]].&lt;ref name=wolff /&gt;

Jaujard, however, could do very little to protect the private art collections of Paris and France from the predations of the ERR.  These collections &amp;ndash; those of the French [[Rothschilds]]; [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], the art dealer; [[Georges Wildenstein|Georges]] and [[Daniel Wildenstein]]; the investment banker [[Pierre David-Weill]]; [[Germain Seligman]], the art historian and dealer; [[Alphonse Kann]]; and the other great collectors of the time&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 158, 196&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; were systematically subjected to confiscations under various bureaucratically outlined pretenses of "protection", and were then brought to the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume|''Jeu de Paume'']] museum, where they were [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume#Nazi sroting house|cataloged and divided up]] for Hitler's collection &amp;ndash; Posse took 53 paintings,&lt;ref name=evans /&gt; for Göring's, for the use of Alfred Rosenberg's "scholarly" institutions which were attempting to prove the inferiority of Jews, as well as for other purposes.  Fortunately, [[Rose Valland]] &amp;ndash; at the time an unpaid museum employee, later the museum's ''attaché'' and ''Assistante'',&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 194, 201-202&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; was a member of the [[French resistance]], and had remained working at the museum on Jaujard's orders. Valland kept lists of all the works which came in, the secret storehouses where they were stockpiled when they left the museum, and the numbers of the train cars when the last of the paintings were shipped to Germany just before the Allied recapturing of Paris.  Using Valland's information, the Resistance was able to delay the train sufficiently so that it never reached Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 160-63, 177-189&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1979-089-22, Hermann Göring crop.jpg|thumb|left|167px|Hermann Göring in 1942]]

====Hermann Göring====
Although the ERR, in theory, was part of Alfred Rosenberg's Nazi empire, Rosenberg was an ideologue who had no interest in art, and did not appreciate the value to Germany of looting the patrimony of the occupied countries.  ''Reichsmarschall'' Hermann Göring, on the other hand, Hitler's anointed successor and the head of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', was an avid collector of confiscated artworks, with an unquenchable appetite for jewels and finery as well.  As a result, the ERR in France became in large part "Göring's personal looting organization."&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 197-201&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the war, Göring paid 20 visits to the ''Jeu de Paume'' in Paris to views the results of the ERR's confiscations.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), caption to 10th photograph between pp. 208-10&lt;/ref&gt;  At times Göring also utilized  [[Kajetan Mühlmann]], an Austrian art historian and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer, as his personal agent.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;

On occasion, Göring's desires conflicted with those of Hitler and Hitler's agents.  When this occurred, Göring gave way, not wanting to provoke trouble with the ''Führer''.  Several times, he also made "gifts" to the collection of the ''Führermuseum''.  He sent 53 pieces from the French Rothschild Collection, which had been confiscated in Paris for him by the ERR, to Munich to be held for the Linz museum,&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; including [[Vermeer]]'s [[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|''The Astronomer'']], sent in November 1940,&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; and which became Hitler's most cherished painting in his collection.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, in 1945, Göring gave Hitler 17 paintings and 4 bronzes from the [[Naples Museum]].  These had been confiscated by the Hermann Göring Panzer Division while they were being shipped to safety from [[Monte Cassino]] to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], and were later presented to the ''Reichsmarschall'' at [[Carinhall]],&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; his "hunting lodge/art gallery/imperial palace."&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

At its peak, Göring's art collection included 1,375 paintings, 250 sculptures and 168 tapestries.  Its value has been estimated at several hundred million marks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Burleigh|Burleigh, Michael]]. ''Moral Combat: Good and Evil in World War II'' New York: Harper, 2011.  {{ISBN|978-0-06-058097-1}}. p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Soviet Army was about to cross the [[Oder River]] into Germany in February 1945, threatening Carinhall, Göring began to evacuate his art collection by train, sending it to his other residences in the south of Germany.  A second trainload went out in March. and a third in April.  The contents of the shipments were personally chosen by Göring, who, at first, was inclined not to take the artwork he had acquired through the confiscations of the ERR, in case there might be questions of provenance in the future, but he was dissuaded from this course by Walter Andreas Hoffer, who was in charge of Göring's collection.  Even after the contents of three long trains had left, Carinhall still had a considerable amount of art left in it, statues buried around the grounds, and looted furniture still in the rooms. Göring had ''Luftwaffe'' demolition experts wire the estate for destruction, so the treasures he had left behind would not fall into the hands of the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 239-41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dealers and agents===

A number of art dealers and private individuals profited greatly from Hitler's campaign to stock his planned museum.  Primary among them was [[Karl Haberstock]], who operated a wide network of German agents in Paris, the south of France, the Netherlands and Switzerland, but also at least 75 French collaborators.  Haberstock declined to take a commission on the major purchases for the museum, but took his regular fee otherwise, amassing a fortune.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; Thanks to his relationships with Hans Posse and with Hitler, he sold over 100 paintings designated for the Linz collection.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;  When Posse went to France under Hitler's orders, he took the unscrupulous Haberstock with him, and the dealer, working through 82 local agents, purchased 62 pieces for the Linz collection, including works by [[Rembrandt]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Brueghel]], [[Watteau]] and [[Rubens]].&lt;ref name=spotts206&gt;Spotts (2002) p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wilhelm Trübner Karl Haberstock black and white.jpg|thumb|right|212px|[[Karl Haberstock]] in 1914]]

Maria Almas Dietrich was another art dealer who did well by the Nazi obsession with obtaining art.  An acquaintance of Hitler through his official photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann, Dietrich sold 80 paintings to the Linz museum collection, and a further 270 for Hitler's personal collection, as well as over 300 for other German museums and Nazi Party functionaries.  Prolific rather than knowledgeable, Dietrich still managed to make a considerable amount of money from the Linz program.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;  She also managed to avoid being sent to a concentration camp, despite having a Jewish father, bearing a child with her Jewish lover, and marrying a Jew from Turkey, although she renounced Judaism after divorcing him. Hitler, despite his rabid anti-Semitism, was frequently, but not consistently, an unconventional Nazi when it came to Jews involved in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 84; 202&lt;/ref&gt;  It may also have helped that Hitler's mistress Eva Braun was a friend of Dietrich's daughter.&lt;ref name=spotts203&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Dietrich, [[Sturmabteilung|SA]]-''[[Gruppenführer]]'' [[Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse|Prince Philipp of Hessen]] was a connoisseur of the arts and architecture and acted as Posse's principal agent in Italy, where he lived with his wife, a daughter of [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel]]. A grandson of the German Emperor [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]], and a great-grandson of [[Queen Victoria]], Philipp provided "a veneer of aristocratic elegance which facilitated important purchases from the Italian nobility."&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;  Philipp assisted Posse in purchasing 90 paintings from Italy, and bought several more for the Linz collection on his own account.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

Another dealer used by Hans Posse was [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], through whom he made expensive purchases of tapestries, paintings and drawings.&lt;ref name=spotts206 /&gt;

Other Nazi agents in the Linz program included [[Kajetan Mühlmann]], a high [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] official whose territories were Poland and the Netherlands; Baron Kurt von Behr, the head of the ERR in France; and Hitler's photographer Heinrich Hoffmann, an early art adviser who fell from Hitler's favor after 1941, due to Martin Bormann's dislike of him, but who had acted as an intermediary between some German art dealers and the Linz program, and possibly did the same in the Netherlands as well.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;

===Confiscated or bought?===
There is some debate about whether art for the ''Führermuseum'' was primarily stolen or purchased. Hanns Christian Löhr argues in ''Das Braune Haus der Kunst: Hitler und der "Sonderauftrag Linz"'' ("The Brown House of Art and the 'Sonderauftrag Linz'") that only a small portion of the collection – possibly 12 percent – came from seizures or expropriation. Moreover, another 2.5% was derived from forced sales.&lt;ref&gt;Löhr, Hanns Christian. ''Das Braune Haus der Kunst: Hitler und der "Sonderauftrag Linz"''. Berlin Akademie Verlag, 2005. {{ISBN|978-3-05-004156-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Jonathan Petropoulos]], a historian at [[Loyola University Maryland|Loyola College]] in [[Baltimore]] and an expert in wartime looting, argues that most of the purchases were not "[[Arm's length principle|arm's length]]" in nature.&lt;ref name="Boston Globe"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Robinson|first=Walter|date=25 November 1997|title=Sotheby's takes work tied to Nazis off| url=http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/paintings/112597.htm |accessdate=13 December 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030418024422/http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/paintings/112597.htm |archivedate = 18 April 2003 |work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:nl:Gerard Aalders|Gerard Aalders]], a Dutch historian, said those sales amounted to "technical looting," since the Netherlands and other occupied countries were forced to accept German ''Reichsmarks'' that ultimately proved worthless. Aalders argues that "If Hitler's or Goering's art agent stood on your doorstep and offered $10,000 for the painting instead of the $100,000 it was really worth, it was pretty hard to refuse." He adds that Nazis who encountered reluctant sellers threatened to confiscate the art or arrest the owner.&lt;ref name="Boston Globe"/&gt; Birgit Schwarz, an expert on the ''Führermuseum'', in her review of Löhr's book, pointed out that the author focused on the purchases which were held in the ''Führerbau'' in Munich and ignored the deposits of looted art in [[Upper Austria]] in Thürntal, [[Kremsmünster]] and Hohenfurt/[[Vyssi Brod]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Birgit. "Kampf der Zentauren daheim"  [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], (17 October 2005), p. 40; actually, Lohr treats these deposits on pages 135 and 136 of his book&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of purchases versus confiscations, Dr. Cris Whetton, the author of ''Hitler's Fortune''&lt;ref&gt;Whetton, Cris. ''Hitler's Fortune''. Barnsley: Pen and Sword (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had expected to find that [Hitler] was directly responsible for looting and stealing of paintings that he wanted for himself, and I couldn't find any evidence of it, I found evidence that he ''paid'' for them; sometimes at knock-down prices, but not direct theft in any way.  I was quite surprised by this, and I have to say in all honesty that's what I found.&lt;ref&gt;Interviewed on ''Hitler's Riches''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Dutch Advisory Committee on the Assessment of Restitution Applications for Items of Cultural Value and the Second World War assesses sales by Dutch Jews to the ''Sonderauftrag Linz''. At least two restitution claims were rejected because the Committee argued that there were not enough indications showing coercion as the cause of the sale. For example, in 2009 the Restitution Committee rejected the application for the restitution of 12 works sold by the Jewish art dealer [[Kurt Walter Bachstitz]] to the ''Sonderauftrag Linz'' between 1940 and 1941. The Committee argued that Bachstitz had been "undisturbed" in the first years of the occupation and said it had not found signs of coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title= Dutch Restitution Commission RC 1.78, Consideration 5 and 16|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/en/adviezen/advies_178.html/|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the Commission rejected a claim of the heirs of Benjamin and Nathan Katz, former Jewish art dealers in the Netherlands. The claim related ''inter alia'' to 64 works that the art dealership Katz sold to the ''Sonderauftrag Linz''. The Commission came to the conclusion that there were not enough indications demonstrating that the sales were made under duress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Dutch Restitution Commission RC 1.90 B, Consideration 21|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/en/files/advies_rc_190b_pdf.html/|accessdate=7 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408212855/http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/en/files/advies_rc_190b_pdf.html/|archivedate=8 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works which Hans Posse purchased in Vienna for the Linz collection included [[Vermeer]]'s ''[[The Artist in his Studio]]'', [[Titian]]'s ''[[The Toilet of Venus]]'', [[Antonio Canova]]'s ''Polyhymnia'', and several works by [[Rembrandt]].  Among the many paintings Karl Haberstock sold to the collection were two Rembrandts, one of which, ''Portrait of Hendrickje Stoffels'' is now thought to be from the Rembrandt workshop and not a work of the master.  Oddly, Hitler purchased these for an inflated price, despite the fact that seller was a partly Jewish woman and the paintings could have been confiscated.  Posse also purchased over 200 pieces which Jewish owners had managed to get into Switzerland, where they were safe from expropriation.  On the other hand, Posse did not shy away from confiscation either, particular in the former Czechoslovakia and Poland, where all property was subject to it, but also in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=spotts198plus&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 198-202&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hitler 20 April 1945.jpg|thumb|Hitler on 20 April 1945 in his last public appearance, in the garden of the [[Reich Chancellery]], ten days before he and [[Eva Braun]] committed suicide]]

===Size of the collection and Hitler's will===
It is not possible to determine with any accuracy the size of the collection which had been amassed for Hitler's planned museum in Linz, but Frederick Spotts suggests that something around 7,000 pieces had been confiscated, bought or purloined specifically for the ''Führermuseum'', and that others from the many other art repositories scattered around Germany would most probably have been added had Hitler won the war and he and his art experts had the opportunity to sort through the artworks and assign them to various museums.  According to Spotts the figure of 7,000 accords well with the data released by the Art Looting Investigation Unit.&lt;ref name=spotts2167&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 216–17&lt;/ref&gt;  Other experts quote higher figures of up to 8,500 for the ultimate size of the collection.&lt;ref name=barker&gt;Art historian [[Godfrey Barker]], interviewed on ''Hitler's Riches''&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its size, and the unprecedented access Hitler' agents had to artworks throughout Occupied Europe, the Linz collection had noticeable flaws.  According to Spotts, its "gaps" included [[English art]], [[Spanish art]] and art of the [[Northern Renaissance]]; major artists were missing from the [[Italian art|Italian]] part of the collection as well.&lt;ref name=spotts218 /&gt;

Whatever its size and quality, near the end of the war Hitler wanted it understood that he meant the collection to be for the public &amp;ndash; even though there were hundreds of artworks that were specifically marked for use in the ''[[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]]'', his mountain retreat, and for a castle in [[Poznań|Posen]] which Hitler intended as another residence.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Still, in the "Private Testament" he drew up the day before his death, he specified that the collection should go to the museum when it was built, writing that they were "never collected for private purposes, but always only for the expansion of a gallery in my hometown of Linz on the Danube."&lt;ref&gt;Fest (1975), p. 747&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=riches&gt;''Hitler's Riches''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw (2000), p. 821&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage and recovery==

===Repositories===
{{see also|Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program#Art repositories}}

The artworks collected for the ''Führermuseum'' were originally stored in a number of places. The purchases were mostly kept in the air raid shelters of the ''Führerbau'' in [[Munich]] &amp;ndash; one of a number of large buildings Hitler had built in the birthplace of the Nazi Party &amp;ndash; where they were under the control of the Nazi Party Chancellery; Hitler would often come to visit them and indulge in long discussions on art as one of the first tasks when coming to Munich, even during the war.&lt;ref name=fest /&gt; Confiscated artworks were stored in deposits in the area of Upper Austria, located in the middle of forests or in the mountains.  The ERR alone requisitioned six estates for storage, including [[Neuschwanstein Castle]] in the [[Bavarian Alps]], in which items from France were stored; the [[Benedictine monastery]] on the island of [[Frauenchiemsee]] in the [[Chiemsee]] lake, halfway between Munich and [[Salzburg]]; an estate in the [[Salzkammergut]] hills, which had been a summer residence for the Austrian royal family; and the [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]'s hunting lodge.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

Rose Valland eventually shared the trove of information she had gathered at the ''Jeu de Paume'' museum, while the Nazis were using it as a way-station for confiscated art, with 1st Lt. James Rorimer, one of the "Monuments Men" of the [[MFAA]], who would be attached to the U.S. Seventh Army. It would overrun the places in southern Germany &amp;ndash; [[Heilbronn]], Baxheim, [[Hohenschwangau]] and [[Neuschwanstein Castle]] &amp;ndash; which Valland was certain were the locations of the repositories of much of the ERR-looted art which had been shipped back to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 245-49&lt;/ref&gt;  Captain Walker Hancock, the Monuments officer for the U.S. First Army, learned the locations of 109 art repositories in Germany east of [[the Rhine]] from the former assistant of Count Wolff-Metternich of the ''Kunstschutz'', thereby doubling the number of repositories known at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 255-58&lt;/ref&gt; Additional information came to Monuments Men Captain Robert Posey and Private [[Lincoln Kirstein]], who were attached to the U.S. Third Army, from Hermann Bunjes, a corrupted art scholar and former SS Captain who had been deeply involved in the ERR's ''Jeu de Paume'' operation on behalf of Hermann Göring.  From Bunjes came the information that Göring had moved his collection out of Carinhall, and, most importantly, the revelation of the existence of a massive repository in the [[Altaussee|Altaussee salt mines]], which included much of Hitler's collection intended for the ''Fuhrermuseum'' in Linz.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 178, 263-69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StollenSalzbergwerkAltaussee.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A tunnel in the [[Altaussee]] salt mine]]

===Altaussee salt mines===
Despite the fact that the original storage locations, which had no military purpose and were culturally important in any case, would have been extremely unlikely to have been the subject of an Allied air attack, in 1943 Hitler ordered that these collections be moved. Beginning in February 1944, the artworks were relocated to the 14th-century Steinberg salt mines above the village of [[Altaussee]], code-named "Dora",&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;ref name="intelligent-TV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="museum-security"/&gt; in which the holdings of various Viennese museums had earlier been transferred.&lt;ref name=edsel303&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 303-306&lt;/ref&gt;  The transfer of Hitler's Linz collection from the repositories to the salt mine took 13 months to complete, and utilized both tanks and oxen when the trucks could not navigate the steep, narrow and winding roads because of the winter weather. The final convoy of purloined art arrived at the mine in April 1945, just weeks before [[V-E Day]].&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;

The labyrinthine salt mine has a single entrance, and a small gasoline-powered narrow-gauge engine pulling a flat car was utilized to navigate to the various caverns created by centuries of salt mining.  Into these spaces, workmen built storage rooms which boasted wooden floors, racks specifically designed to hold the paintings and other artworks, up-to-date lighting, and dehumidification equipment.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;  Despite the fact that the salt was mined using pipes and sluices through which flowed gravity-fed water from the mountain, which carried dissolved salt 17 miles away to [[Bad Ischl]], where the water was evaporated, leaving behind the salt,&lt;ref name=edsel303 /&gt; the mine was not naturally humid, as the salt in the mine's walls absorbed excess moisture, keeping the chambers at a constant 65% humidity, while the temperature only varied from a low of 4 degrees Celsius (40 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 8 degrees Celsius (47 degrees in the summer).  Mining operations continued as the artwork was loaded into the mines, with the miners occasionally dragooned into helping to unload.&lt;ref name=edsel303 /&gt;

According to James S. Plaut, who from November 1944 to April 1946 was Director of the Art Looting Investigation Unit of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), the salt mines held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;6755 old master paintings, of which 5350 were destined for Linz, 230 drawings, 1039 prints, 95 tapestries, 68 sculptures, 43 cases of objects d'art, and innumerable pieces of furniture; in addition, 119 cases of books from Hitler's library in Berlin, and 237 cases of books for the Linz library.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''Monuments Men'' Edsel gives a slightly different list, which had been prepared by Karl Sieber, the art restorer, and Max Eder, an engineer at the mine, and subsequently given to MFAA officer George Stout:
*6577 paintings
*230 drawings or watercolors
*954 prints
*137 pieces sculpture
*129 pieces arms and armor
*79 baskets of objects
*484 cases objects thought to be archives
*78 pieces furniture
*122 tapestries
*181 cases books
*1200-1700 cases apparently books or similar
*283 cases contents completely unknown

[[File:Bruegger Madonna Altaussee.jpg|thumb|right|325px|[[Michaelangelo]]'s ''[[Madonna of Bruges]]'' being removed from the mine]]

The noted [[Ghent Altarpiece]] &amp;ndash; the stealing of which had caused Jacques Jaujard to protest vehemently and temporarily lose his job &amp;ndash; arrived in the salt mine from [[Neuschwanstein]] in the autumn of 1944, and [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Bruges Madonna]]'' in October of that year.&lt;ref name=edsel303 /&gt; Detailed records were kept at [[Dresden]] and moved to [[Schloss Weißenstein]] at the end of the war, where they were confiscated by the Russians, but these were primarily of the paintings stored in Munich in the ''Fuhrerbau''.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

Also in the Altausee repository was ''The Plague in Florence'' by [[Hans Makart]], a favorite of Hitler's  It had been given to him by Mussolini after Hitler had asked for it numerous times.&lt;ref name=fest /&gt;

In April 1945, Supreme Allied Commander [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] gave up [[Berlin]] as a "prestige objective" that would not be worth the troops killed in order to take it &amp;ndash; the death toll was estimated at 100,000 &amp;ndash; and ordered the Third and Seventh Armies to turn south, towards what the Allies feared might be an "[[Alpine Redoubt]]" from which Hitler or fanatical Nazis could operate a harassing [[Werwolf|guerilla campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Shirer|Shirer, William L.]] ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1960.  pp. 1105-06&lt;/ref&gt; The area was known to have hidden caches of arms and supplies, and intelligence reports had told of SS units moving from Berlin into that area. This new strategy meant that Neuschwanstein and Altausee would be overrun, and the "Monuments Men" would be able to verify and recover the important art repositories that their information said were located in those places.&lt;ref name=edsel303 /&gt;

===Attempted destruction of the Altaussee repository===

As the Allied troops approached the salt mines, [[August Eigruber]], the ''[[Gauleiter]]'' of Upper Austria, gave orders to blow it up and destroy the artwork using the eight crates of 500-kilogram bombs he had stored in the mine on 10 and 13 April 1945.&lt;ref name=edsel303 /&gt; Hitler, through Martin Bormann, countermanded this order, and [[Albert Speer]], the Minister of Armaments and War Production, had "clarified" Hitler's [[scorched earth]] "[[Nero Decree]]", but Eigruber felt he knew what Hitler's actual intent was. He ignored the pleas from the managers of the mine that it be saved as a vital resource &amp;ndash; in Heilbronn another salt mine which was used to store art had been ordered to be blown up, but the miners refused to do so, as the mine was vital to their lives and livelihoods.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009) pp. 318-21&lt;/ref&gt; After the ''Führer'''s suicide, Eigruber ignored the conflicting and confusing orders coming from Berlin and again ordered the destruction of the mine and all the artwork in it.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 324-15&lt;/ref&gt; The managers of the mine attempted to remove the crates of bombs, but were headed off by Eigruber's adjutant, who placed armed guards loyal to the Gauleiter at the entrance.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 337&lt;/ref&gt; The bombs were then wired for detonation by a demolition team.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009). p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;

Eigruber fled with an elite SS bodyguard, fully expecting his order of destruction to be carried out. Nevertheless, this did not happen.  Instead, between 1 and 7 May 1945, before the arrival of U.S. Army troops on 8 May, the eight 500-kilogram bombs were removed from the mine, and the tunnels near the mine entrance were blown up, blocking the mine and protecting it from intrusion without doing damage to the irreplaceable and priceless art collection inside.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p.374-75&lt;/ref&gt;

Who, exactly, was responsible for saving the artwork took many years to determine, and was finally unravelled in the 1980s by Austrian historian Ernst Kubin. The plan was devised by Dr. Emmerich Pöchmüller, the general director of the mine, Eberhard Mayerhoffer, the technical director, and Otto Högler, the mine's foreman. It was sanctioned by Ernst Kaltenbrunner, an SS officer of high rank in the [[Gestapo]] who had grown up in the area, and was later convicted of mass-murder and hanged.  The plan was carried out by the miners,&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; with the tacit approval of Eigruber's guards, several of whom had been persuaded by Karl Sieber, an art restorer who had worked on paintings stored in the mine, that destroying the artwork and the mine was not a good idea. The entire operation took three weeks to implement.  On 5 May the signal was given, and six tons of explosives with 386 detonators and 502 timing switches were activated, causing 66 blasts which closed off 137 tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 374-81&lt;/ref&gt;  The blockages took about a month to clear away totally, although a hole big enough for a man to sidle through was completed by the miners overnight after the Americans arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 382-85&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to geo-political considerations, U.S. forces were ordered to pull back from the territory which included Altaussee, as it had been determined that it would be part of the Russian zone of occupation.  Because of this, the paintings and artworks in the mine were removed and transferred elsewhere in about two weeks, rather than the year which had originally been planned.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 385-87&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the approximately 12,000 pieces of art in the mine were recovered.&lt;ref name=riches /&gt; The Altaussee trove included both works meant specifically for the ''Führermuseum'' and other looted artwork as well.  Other caches of art not intended for Linz were recovered in places throughout the Reich; there were over 1000 repositories in southern Germany alone,.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; although some of the artworks in them came from the collections of German museums &amp;ndash; these were eventually returned. Much of Göring's collection from his estate at [[Carinhall]] was discovered in a cave at [[Berchtesgaden]], where he had a summer home near Hitler's Berghof retreat,&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; part of it was also left in his private train, which was found in Unterstein, and had been looted by the local residents.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

===Looting of the Munich repository===

Part of the collection designated for the Linz museum was stored in the air raid shelters of the Führer Building in Munich, part of the Nazi complex there.  The building was broken into by a mob before American troops arrived in the city, and most of the 723 paintings still there were looted, with others were taken by American soldiers.  Only 148 paintings were eventually recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 215-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war==
[[File:München Museum für Abgüsse klassischer Bildwerke (Gebäudefassade) crop.jpg|thumb|left|255px|The first building of the "Central Collecting Point" in Munich, which later became the [[Museum für Abgüsse Klassischer Bildwerke|Museum of Casts of Classical Statues]]; it had been an administrative building for the Nazi Party. Later, other buildings in the complex were used when this building was full.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 391-92&lt;/ref&gt;]]

After the war, the American [[Nazi plunder#Art Looting Investigation Unit|Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU)]] of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) made thirteen detailed reports on the Linz museum and the Nazi plundering of art.&lt;ref name="petropoulos"&gt;{{Citation|first=Prof. Jonathan |last=Petropolous|title = Linz: Hitler's Museum and Library: Consolidated Interrogation Report No. 4, 15 December 1945, The Reports of the Office of Strategic Services Art Looting Investigation Unit |url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/pcha/linztable.html | accessdate=13 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These reports were synthesised into four consolidated reports; the fourth of these was written by S. Lane Faison covering the ''Führermuseum''.&lt;ref name="petropoulos"/&gt; These reports focused on returning art to rightful owners.  The authority for this was the 1943 Declaration of London, which invalidated all German art purchases in the occupied territories.

Most of the paintings and other artworks were brought to the "Central Collecting Point" in Munich, a former Nazi Party administrative building, where they were registered and rephotographed if necessary. Restitutions occurred as early as autumn 1945.  The work was turned over to German authorities in September 1949. In 1962, the responsible agency was disbanded, and the remaining unreturnable artworks were assessed for their value as museum items. These were loaned to various museums, while other pieces are on loan to government agencies.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

Jacques Jaujard, the French Director of National Museums, was hailed as a national hero following the war for his part in saving the French national art collection.  He was made a Commander of the [[Legion of Honor]] and given the [[Medal of Resistance]].  [[Rose Valland]], who surreptitiously collected information on the looted artwork that passed through the ''Jeu de Paume'' museum, became a fine arts officer with the French First Army and assisted the MFAA in the collection of looted artwork. She was inducted into the French Legion of Honor and also received the Medal of Resistance, was awarded the [[Medal of Freedom (1945)|Medal of Freedom]] from the U.S. and the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit]] from [[West Germany]].  In 1953, she finally received the coveted title of "curator". Count Franz von Wolff-Metternich, the "good German" arts officer who helped to protect the French national art collection from Nazi predation worked with the Allies after the war, return artworks to their rightful owners, then joined the West German Foreign Office, where he tracked looted art.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 410-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the men of the Altaussee salt mine who were responsible for saving the artwork stored there by preventing the mine from being blown up did not fare well in the postwar period.  All members of the Nazi Party, as were most professionals at that time in order to be allowed to work, they were all affected to one degree or another by the post-war [[denazification]] efforts.  None of them received during their lifetimes the credit that was due to them for their acts in saving a significant portion of the art which had been looted by the Nazis from the Occupied Territories.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 406-10&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Eastern Europe]], Soviet premier [[Joseph Stalin]] tasked Mikhail Khrapchenko with taking many of the ''Führermuseum'' artworks to stock Soviet art galleries.&lt;ref name="intelligent-TV"/&gt; Khrapchenko said "it would now be possible to turn [[Moscow]]’s [[Pushkin Museum]] into one of the world’s great museums, like the [[British Museum]], the [[Louvre]], or the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]]."{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Stockpiled artwork was recovered by the Soviet "Trophy Brigades" from the two enormous flaktowers which had been built in Berlin to shelter people and supplies; many of the paintings in the Friedrichshain Flaktower were destroyed by fires.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 353-55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments===
In 1998, the Federal Republic of Germany and 43 other countries agreed to the "Washington Principles", which required them to closely inspect their art inventories to establish the provenance of works which had changed ownership between 1933 and 1945.  In particular, German, France, Austria and the Netherlands and other countries publicly disclosed what artworks from the ''Sonderauftrag Linz'' collection remained in their inventories. The work began in Germany in 2000, and artworks which are "shown by renewed research to involve a persecution-related deprivation of property during the National Socialist period are to be returned."&lt;ref name=history /&gt;  In his book ''Das Braune Haus der Kunst: Hitler und der "Sonderauftrag Linz"'' ("The Brown House of Art and the 'Sonderauftrag Linz'"), published in Germany in 2005, Hans Christian Löhr argued that 191 artworks were missing at that time, and that they may be hanging in museums or private collections.&lt;ref name="DW"/&gt;  This is discussed in the film documentary ''[[The Rape of Europa (book)|The Rape of Europa]]'' and in [[Noah Charney]]'s book ''The Ghent Altarpiece, Stealing the Mystic Lamb''.

As of 2010, a photo album that an American soldier took from the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]], Hitler's vacation home, which catalogued artwork Hitler desired for the museum, was to be returned to Germany. Of the photo albums created for Hitler, 39 of them were discovered by American armed forces at [[Neuschwanstein]], where they had been deposited for safekeeping in April 1945.  These were used as evidence in the [[Nuremberg trials]], and are now at the [[United States National Archives]], with two others donated by Robert Edsel in 2007 and c.2013.  Edsel is the author of the book ''The Monuments Men'' about the activities of the Allied [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] (MFAA), on which [[The Monuments Men|the film of the same name]] was loosely based, and also the founder of the Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art. He got the two albums from the heirs of an American soldier.  Nineteen other albums recovered from Berchtesgaden were in Germany on permanent loan from the [[German Federal Archives]] (''Bundesarchiv'') to the German Historical Museum as of 2010, and 11 albums are considered to be lost.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2009/dec/09/wwii-veteran-had-hitlers-art-book-on-bookshelf/ "WWII veteran had Hitler's art book on bookshelf"] ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' (December 9, 2009) Accessed: March 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2008/nr08-22.html "National Archives Announces Discovery of "Hitler Albums" Documenting Looted Art" (press release)] [[United States National Archives]] (November 1, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">In [[mathematics]], the concept of a '''generalised metric''' is a generalisation of that of a [[metric space|metric]], in which the distance is not a [[real number]] but taken from an arbitrary [[ordered field]].

In general, when we define [[metric space]] the distance function is taken to be a real-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]]. The real numbers form an ordered field which is [[archimedean property|Archimedean]] and [[complete ordered field|order complete]]. These metric spaces have some nice properties like: in a metric space [[compactness]], [[sequential compactness]] and [[countable compactness]] are equivalent etc. These properties may not, however, hold so easily if the distance function is taken in an arbitrary ordered field, instead of in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.

==Preliminary definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;(F,+,\cdot,&lt;)&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary ordered field, and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; a nonempty set; a function &lt;math&gt;d :M\times M\to F^+\cup\{0\}&lt;/math&gt; is called a metric on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, iff the following conditions hold:

# &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=0\Leftrightarrow x=y&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=d(y,x)&lt;/math&gt;, commutativity;
# &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)+d(y,z)\geq d(x,z)&lt;/math&gt;, triangle inequality.

It is not difficult to verify that the open balls &lt;math&gt;B(x,\delta)\;:=\{y\in M\;:d(x,y)&lt;\delta\}&lt;/math&gt; form a basis for a suitable topology, the latter called the  ''[[metric topology]]'' on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, with the metric in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

In view of the fact that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; in its [[order topology]] is [[monotonically normal]], we would expect &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to be at least [[Regular space|regular]].

== Further properties ==
However, under [[axiom of choice]], every general metric is [[monotonically normal]], for, given &lt;math&gt;x\in G&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is open, there is an open ball &lt;math&gt;B(x,\delta)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x\in B(x,\delta)\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt;. Take &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)=B(x,\delta/2)&lt;/math&gt;. Verify the conditions for Monotone Normality.

The matter of wonder is that, even without choice, general metrics are [[monotonically normal]].

''proof''.

Case I: ''F'' is an [[Archimedean field]].

Now, if ''x'' in  &lt;math&gt;G, G&lt;/math&gt; open, we may take &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G):= B(x,1/2n(x,G))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n(x,G):= \min\{n\in\mathbb N:B(x,1/n)\subseteq G\}&lt;/math&gt;, and the trick is done without choice.

Case II: F is a non-Archimedean field.

For given &lt;math&gt;x\in G&lt;/math&gt; where ''G'' is open, consider the set
&lt;math&gt;A(x,G):=\{a\in F\colon \forall n\in\mathbb N,B(x,n\cdot a)\subseteq G\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The  set ''A''(''x'', ''G'') is non-empty. For, as ''G'' is open, there is an open ball ''B''(''x'', ''k'') within ''G''. Now, as ''F'' is non-Archimdedean, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N_F&lt;/math&gt; is not bounded above, hence there is some &lt;math&gt;\xi\in F&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\forall n\in\mathbb N\colon n\cdot 1\le\xi&lt;/math&gt;. Putting &lt;math&gt;a=k\cdot (2\xi)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, we see that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is in ''A''(''x'', ''G'').

Now define &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)=\bigcup\{B(x,a)\colon a\in A(x,G)\}&lt;/math&gt;. We would show that with respect to this mu operator, the space is monotonically normal. Note that &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt;.

If ''y'' is not in ''G''(open set containing ''x'') and ''x'' is not in ''H''(open set containing ''y''), then we'd show that &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)\cap\mu(y,H)&lt;/math&gt; is empty. If not, say ''z'' is in the intersection. Then

: &lt;math&gt;\exists a\in A(x,G)\colon d(x,z)&lt;a;\;\;
\exists b\in A(y,H)\colon d(z,y)&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

From the above, we get that &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)\le d(x,z)+d(z,y)&lt;2\cdot\max\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt;, which is impossible since this would imply that either ''y'' belongs to &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt; or ''x'' belongs to &lt;math&gt;\mu(y,H)\subseteq H&lt;/math&gt;.

So we are done!

{{Governance}}
'''Governance''' comprises all of the processes of governing - whether undertaken by the [[government]] of a [[state (polity) | state]], by a [[market (economics) |market]] or by a [[social network| network]] - over a [[social system]] ([[family]], [[tribe]], [[formal organization |formal]] or [[informal organization]], a [[territory]] or across territories) and whether through the [[laws]], [[norm (social) |norm]]s, [[political power|power]] or [[language]] of an organized society.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite book |last= Bevir |first= Mark |title= Governance: A very short introduction |year= 2012 |publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford, UK | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ozjcWIfhoO8C | quote = Governance refers, therefore, to all processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government, market, or network, whether over a family, tribe, formal or informal organization, or territory, and whether through laws, norms, power or language. Governance differs from government in that it focuses less on the state and its institutions and more on social practices and activities. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It relates to "the processes of interaction and decision-making among the actors involved in a collective problem that lead to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of [[social norm]]s and [[institution]]s".&lt;ref name="Hufty 2011"&gt;

In lay terms, it could be described as the political processes that exist in and between formal institutions.

A variety of entities (known generically as '''governing bodies''') can govern. The most formal is a '''government''', a body whose sole responsibility and authority is to make binding decisions in a given [[geopolitical]] system (such as a [[sovereign state|state]]) by establishing [[law]]s. Other types of governing include an organization (such as a [[corporation]] recognized as a legal entity by a government), a socio-political group ([[chiefdom]], tribe, [[gang]], family, [[religious denomination]], etc.), or another, informal [[social group | group]] of people. In [[business sector | business]] and [[outsourcing]] relationships, [[Governance Frameworks|governance frameworks]] are built{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} into [[relational contract]]s that foster long-term collaboration and innovation.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Governance is the way rules, norms and actions are structured, sustained, regulated and held [[accountability |accountable]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} The degree of formality depends on the internal rules of a given [[organization]] and, externally, with its [[business partner]]s. As such, governance may take many forms, driven by many different motivations and with many different results. For instance, a government may operate as a [[democracy]] where citizens vote on who should govern and the [[public good]] is the goal, while a [[non-profit organization]] or a [[corporation]] may be governed by a small [[board of directors]] and pursue more specific aims.

In addition, a variety of external actors without decision-making power can influence the process of governing. These include [[lobbying |lobbies]], [[think tanks]], [[political parties]], [[non-government organizations]] , community and [[Media (communication) | media]].

==Origin of the word==
{{Disputed section|Origins of the word|date=August 2016}}
Like ''government'', the word ''governance'' derives, ultimately, from the Greek verb kubernaein [''kubernáo''] (meaning ''to steer'', the metaphorical sense first being attested in [[Plato]]). Its occasional use in English to refer to the specific activity of ruling a country can be traced to early modern England, when the phrase "governance of the realm" appears in works by [[William Tyndale]]&lt;ref name="TyndaleFrith1831"&gt;"When the king's grace came first to the right of the crown, and unto the governance of the realm young and unexpert..." {{cite book|author1=William Tyndale|author2=John Frith|title=The works of Tyndale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qoMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA452|year=1831|publisher=Ebenezer Palmer|page=452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in royal correspondence between [[James V of Scotland]] and [[Henry VIII of England]].&lt;ref&gt;"We have put all our confidence, has als actyflie with ye help of our derrest Modir takin on Ws ye governance of our Realme": {{cite book|title=State Papers: King Henry the Eighth; Part IV.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hs0_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA95|year=1836|publisher=Murray|page=95|chapter=Letter of James V to Henry VIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first usage in connection with institutional structures (as distinct from individual rule) is in [[Charles Plummer]]’s ''The Governance of England'' (an 1885 translation from a 15th-century Latin work by [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]], also known as ''The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy''). This usage of governance to refer to the arrangements of governing became orthodox including in [[Sidney Low]]’s seminal text of the same title in 1904 and among some later British constitutional historians.

However, the use of the term ''governance'' in its current broader sense, encompassing the activities of a wide range of public and private institutions, acquired general currency only as recently as the 1990s, when it was re-minted by economists and political scientists and disseminated by institutions such as the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/governance/docs/doc5_fr.pdf Étymologie du terme "gouvernance"], document prepared by the [[European Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the term has steadily gained increasing usage.

==Types==
Governance often refers to a particular 'level' of governance associated with a type of organization (including public governance, global governance, non-profit governance, corporate governance, and project governance), a particular 'field' of governance associated with a type of activity or outcome (including environmental governance, internet governance, and information technology governance), or a particular 'model' of governance, often derived as an empirical or normative theory (including regulatory governance, participatory governance, multilevel governance, metagovernance, and collaborative governance).

Governance can also define normative or practical agendas. Normative concepts of fair governance or good governance are common among [[Politics|political]], [[public sector]], [[Volunteering|voluntary]], and [[private sector]] organizations.

===Governance as process===
{{Unreferenced section|date = December 2013}}In its most abstract sense, governance is a theoretical concept referring to the actions and processes by which stable practices and organizations arise and persist. These actions and processes may operate in formal and informal organizations of any size; and they may function for any purpose, good or evil, for profit or not. Conceiving of governance in this way, one can apply the concept to [[State (polity)|states]], to [[corporation]]s, to [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]]s, to [[NGO]]s, to partnerships and other associations, to business relationships (especially complex [[outsourcing]] relationships), to [[project team]]s, and to any number of humans engaged in some purposeful activity.

Most theories of governance as process arose out of [[neoclassical economics]]. These theories build deductive models, based on the assumptions of modern economics, to show how rational actors may come to establish and sustain formal organizations, including firms and states, and informal organizations, such as networks and practices for governing the commons. Many of these theories draw on [[transaction cost]] economics.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E. (1979) "Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations," ''Journal of Law and Economics'': Vol. 22: No. 2, Article 3|accessible at: http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public governance===
{{main|Public administration}}
There is a distinction between the concepts of governance and [[politics]]. Politics involves processes by which a group of people (perhaps with divergent opinions or interests) reach collective decisions generally regarded as binding on the group, and enforced as common [[policy]]. Governance, on the other hand, conveys the [[Public administration|administrative]] and process-oriented elements of governing rather than its antagonistic ones.&lt;ref&gt;Offe, Claus, (2009) Governance: An “Empty Signifier”? ''Constellations,'' 16: 550–62. {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-8675.2009.00570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an argument continues to assume the possibility of the traditional separation between "politics" and "administration". Contemporary governance practice and theory sometimes questions this distinction, premising that both "governance" and "politics" involve aspects of [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[accountability]].

In general terms, public governance occurs in three broad ways:
* Through networks involving [[public-private partnership]]s (PPP) or with the collaboration of community organisations;
* Through the use of [[Market (economics)|market]] mechanisms whereby market principles of competition serve to allocate resources while operating under government regulation;
* Through top-down methods that primarily involve governments and the state [[bureaucracy]].

===Private governance===
Private governance occurs when non-governmental entities, including private organizations, [[dispute resolution organizations]], or other third party groups, make rules and/or standards which have a binding effect on the "quality of life and opportunities of the larger public."  Simply put, private—not public—entities are making [[public policy]]. For example, insurance companies exert a great societal impact, largely invisible and freely accepted, that is a private form of governance in society; in turn, reinsurers, as private companies, may exert similar private governance over their underlying carriers.&lt;ref&gt;Marcos Antonio Mendoza, "Reinsurance as Governance: Governmental Risk Management Pools as a Case Study in the Governance Role Played by Reinsurance Institutions", 21 Conn. Ins. L.J. 53, 68–70 (2014) http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2573253&lt;/ref&gt; The term "public policy" should not be exclusively associated with policy that is made by [[government]]. Public policy may be created by either the private sector or the public sector. If one wishes to refer only to public policy that is made by government, the best term to use is "governmental policy," which eliminates the ambiguity regarding the agent of the policy making.

===Global governance===
{{main|Global governance}}
Global governance is defined as "the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, right and obligations are established, and differences are mediated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thakur|first1=Ramesh|last2=Van Langenhove|first2=Luk|title=Enhancing Global Governance through Regional Integration|journal=Global Governance|date=2006|volume=12|issue=3 July, September|pages=233–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the traditional meaning of "governance", some authors like [[James Rosenau]] have used the term "global governance" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority.&lt;ref&gt;James N. Rosenau, "Toward an Ontology for Global Governance", in Martin Hewson and Thomas Sinclair, eds., ''Approaches to Global Governance Theory'', SUNY Press, Albany, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The best example of this is the international system or relationships between independent states. The term, however, can apply wherever a group of free equals needs to form a regular relationship.

===Governance Analytical Framework===
The Governance Analytical Framework (GAF) is a practical methodology for investigating governance processes, where various stakeholders interact and make decisions regarding collective issues, thus creating or reinforcing social norms and institutions. It is postulated that governance processes can be found in any society, and unlike other approaches, that these can be observed and analysed from a non-[[normative]] perspective. It proposes a methodology based on five main analytical units: problems, actors, norms, processes and "nodal points". These logically articulated analytical units make up a coherent methodology aimed at being used as a tool for empirical [[social policy]] research.&lt;ref name="Hufty 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hufty |first=Marc |title=Governance: Exploring four approaches and their relevance to research. In: Wiesmann, U., Hurni, H., et al. editors. Research for Sustainable Development: Foundations, Experiences, and Perspectives. |year=2011 |location=Bern |publisher=Geographica Bernensia: 165–183.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spear, Cornforth &amp; Aiken, 2009. The governance challenges of social enterprises: Evidence from a UK empirical study. Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 89(2): 247–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonprofit governance===
Nonprofit governance has a dual focus: achieving the organization's social mission and the ensuring the organization is viable. Both responsibilities relate to fiduciary responsibility that a board of trustees (sometimes called directors, or Board, or Management Committee—the terms are interchangeable) has with respect to the exercise of authority over the explicit actions the organization takes. Public trust and accountability is an essential aspect of organizational viability so it achieves the social mission in a way that is respected by those whom the organization serves and the society in which it is located.

===Corporate governance===
{{main|Corporate governance}}
[[Corporation|Corporate organizations]] often use the word ''governance'' to describe both:
# The manner in which [[Board of directors|board]]s or their like direct a corporation
# The laws and customs (rules) applying to that direction

Corporate governance consists of the set of processes, customs, policies, laws and institutions affecting the way people direct, administer or control a corporation. Corporate governance also includes the relationships among the many players involved (the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]) and the corporate [[goal]]s. The principal players include the [[shareholder]]s, [[management]], and the [[board of directors]]. Other stakeholders include employees, suppliers, customers, banks and other lenders, regulators, the environment and the community at large.

The first documented use of the word "corporate governance" is by Richard Eells (1960, p.&amp;nbsp;108) to denote "the structure and functioning of the corporate polity". The "corporate government" concept itself is older and was already used in finance textbooks at the beginning of the 20th century (Becht, Bolton, Röell 2004).

===Project governance===
{{main|Project governance}}
Project governance is the management framework within which project decisions are made.

===Environmental governance===
{{main|Environmental governance}}

===Land governance===
Land governance is concerned with issues of land ownership and tenure. It consists of the policies, processes and institutions by which decisions about the access to, use of and control over land are made, implemented and enforced; it is also about managing and reconciling competing claims on land. In developing countries, it is relevant as a tool to contribute to equitable and sustainable development, addressing the phenomenon that is known as ‘[[land grabbing]]’.&lt;ref&gt;Focus on Land in Africa (http://www.focusonland.com/property-rights-issues/land-governance-and-law-1/)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTARD/Resources/335807-1194987153844/UNHABITATFricska.ppt Policy Paper: Good Land Governance]. Global Land Tool Network, no date.&lt;/ref&gt; The operational dimension of land governance is [[land administration]].

Security of land tenure is considered to contribute to poverty reduction and food security, since it can enable farmers to fully participate in the economy. Without recognized property rights, it is hard for small entrepreneurs, farmers included, to obtain credit or sell their business&lt;ref&gt;[[Hernando de Soto Polar|De Soto, Hernando]]. [http://www.basicbooks.com/full-details?isbn=9780465016150 The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else]. New York: Basic Books. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; - hence the relevance of comprehensive land governance.

There is constant feedback between land tenure problems and land governance.  For instance, it has been argued that what is frequently called '[[land grabbing]]', was partly made possible by the [[Washington Consensus]]-inspired liberalization of land markets in developing countries. Many land acquisition deals were perceived to have negative consequences, and this in turn led to initiatives to improve land governance in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Mayke Kaag and Annelies Zoomers: [https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/the-global-land-grab/ The global land grab: beyond the hype], Zed Books, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of land governance depends on its practical implementation, which is known as [[land administration]]: ‘the way in which rules of land tenure are made operational’. And another factor is accountability:  the degree to which citizens and stakeholder groups are consulted and can hold to account their authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Mayke Kaag and Annelies Zoomers, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main international policy initiative to improve land governance is known as the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (VGGT),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/ VGGT]&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed by the [[Committee on World Food Security]] (CFS).

===Internet governance===
{{main|Internet governance}}

===Information technology governance===
{{main|Information technology governance}}
IT governance primarily deals with connections between business focus and IT management. The goal of clear governance is to assure the investment in IT generate business value and mitigate the risks that are associated with IT projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Smallwood | first= Deb | work= Tech Decision CIO Insights | title = IT Governance: A Simple Model | date = March 2009 | url = http://www.ebizq.net/blogs/insurance/2009/02/it_governance_a_simple_model.php
| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulatory governance===
{{main|Regulatory governance}}
Regulatory governance reflects the emergence of decentered and mutually adaptive policy regimes which rests on regulation rather than service provision or taxing and spending.&lt;ref&gt;David Levi-Faur, "Regulation &amp; Regulatory Governance", in David Levi-Faur, Handbook on the Politics of Regulation, Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, 2011, pp. 1–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The term captures the tendency of policy regimes to deal with complexity with delegated system of rules. It is likely to appear in arenas and nations which are more complex, more global, more contested and more liberally democratic.&lt;ref&gt;Braithwaite, John, Cary Coglianese, and David Levi‐Faur. "Can regulation and governance make a difference?." Regulation &amp; Governance 1.1 (2007): 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The term builds upon and extends the terms of the regulatory state on the one hand and governance on the other. While the term regulatory state marginalize non-state actors (NGOs and Business) in the domestic and global level, the term governance marginalizes regulation as a constitutive instrument of governance. The term regulatory governance therefore allows us to understand governance beyond the state and governance via regulation.

===Participatory governance===
Participatory governance focuses on deepening democratic engagement through the participation of citizens in the processes of governance with the state. The idea is that citizens should play a more direct roles in public decision-making or at least engage more deeply with political issues. Government officials should also be responsive to this kind of engagement. In practice, participatory governance can supplement the roles of citizens as voters or as watchdogs through more direct forms of involvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/publication/triumph-deficit-or-contestation-deepening-the-deepening-democracy-debate 'Triumph, Deficit or Contestation? Deepening the 'Deepening Democracy' Debate'] Institute of Development Studies (IDS) Working Paper 264 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contract governance===
(See also [[contract management]].) Emerging thinking about contract governance is focusing on creating a governance structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex contractual arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, flexible, and credible way.&lt;ref&gt;Unpacking Outsourcing Governance: How to Build a Sound Governance Structure to Drive Insight Versus Oversight|[http://www.vestedway.com/vested-library/]|2015|Vested Way|accessed 17 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson wrote that the governance structure for a contract is the “framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided.” Adding further that “because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction.”&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E. (1979) "Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations," Journal of Law and Economics: Vol. 22: No. 2, Article 3|accessible at: http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multilevel governance===
{{main|Multilevel governance}}

===Metagovernance===
"Metagovernance" is the "governing of governing".&lt;ref&gt;Kooiman, J. ''Governing as Governance''. Sage publications 2003. p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the established ethical principles, or 'norms', that shape and steer the entire governing process. It is important to note that there are no clearly defined settings within which metagoverning takes place, or particular persons who are responsible for it. While some{{Who|date=January 2012}} believe metagoverning to be the role of the state which is assumed to want to steer actors in a particular direction, it can "potentially be exercised by any resourceful actor"&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, E. Metagovernance: The Changing Role of Politicians in Processes of Democratic Governance. ''American Review of Public Administration.'' Volume 36 2006, pp. 98–114 (p. 103).&lt;/ref&gt; who wishes to influence the governing process. Examples of this include the publishing of codes of conduct at the highest level of international government,&lt;ref&gt;Onyango, P &amp; Jentoft, S. Assessing Poverty in small-scale fisheries in Lake Victoria, Tanzania.''Fish and Fisheries''. Volume 11 2010, pp. 250–63 (p. 258).&lt;/ref&gt; and media focus on specific issues&lt;ref name="evans"&gt;Evans, J. ''Environmental Governance''. Routledge 2012. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; at the socio-cultural level. Despite their different sources, both seek to establish values in such a way that they become accepted 'norms'. The fact that 'norms' can be established at any level and can then be used to shape the governance process as whole, means metagovernance is part of both the input and the output of the governing system.&lt;ref&gt;Kooiman, J. ''Governing as Governance''. Sage publications 2003. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborative governance===
{{See also|Collaborative governance}}
A collaborative governance framework uses a relationship management structure, joint performance and transformation management processes and an exit management plan as controlling mechanisms to encourage the organizations to make ethical, proactive changes for the mutual benefit of all the parties.&lt;ref name="Vitasek"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vitasek|first=Kate|display-authors=etal |title=The Vested Outsourcing Manual|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=0230112684|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security sector governance ===
{{See also|Security sector governance}}Security sector governance (SSG) is a subpart concept or framework of security governance that focuses specifically on decisions about [[security]] and their implementation within the [[National security|security sector]] of a single state. SSG applies the principles of [[good governance]] to the security sector in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dcaf.ch|title=Security Sector Governance|last=|first=|publisher=Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)|year=2015|isbn=|series=SSR Backgrounder Series|location=Geneva|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a normative concept==

===Fair governance===

When discussing governance in particular organizations, the quality of governance within the organization is often compared to a standard of [[good governance]]. In the case of a [[business]] or of a [[non-profit organization]], for example, good governance relates to consistent management, cohesive policies, guidance, processes and decision-rights for a given area of responsibility, and proper oversight and accountability. "Good governance" implies that mechanisms function in a way that allows the executives (the "agents") to respect the rights and interests of the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] (the "principals"), in a spirit of [[democracy]].

===Good governance===
{{Main|Good governance}}
Good governance is an indeterminate term used in international development literature to describe various normative accounts of how public institutions ought to conduct public affairs and manage public resources. These normative accounts are often justified on the grounds that they are thought to be conducive to economic ends, such as the eradication of poverty and successful economic development. Unsurprisingly different organizations have defined governance and good governance differently to promote different normative ends.

The [[World Bank]] defines governance as:
{{quote|the manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country's economic and social resources for development.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/03/07/000090341_20060307104630/Rendered/PDF/34899.pdf Managing Development – The Governance Dimension], 1991, Washington D.C., p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project of the World Bank defines governance as:
{{quote|the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/1740479-1150402582357/2661829-1158008871017/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This considers the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies and the respect of citizens and the state of the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them.

An alternate definition sees governance as:
{{quote|the use of institutions, structures of authority and even [[collaboration]] to allocate [[Resource (economics)|resources]] and coordinate or control activity in society or the economy''.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Stephen, 2002. Economic Governance and Institutional Dynamics, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s Regional Project on Local Governance for Latin America:

{{quote|Governance has been defined as the rules of the political system to solve conflicts between actors and adopt decision (legality). It has also been used to describe the "proper functioning of institutions and their acceptance by the public" (legitimacy). And it has been used to invoke the efficacy of government and the achievement of consensus by democratic means (participation).&lt;ref&gt;This is a very widely cited definition, as in [http://info.publicintelligence.net/ISAFgovernance.pdf Applebaugh, J. (rapporteur), "Governance Working Group", power-point presentation, National Defense University and ISAF, 2010, slide 22].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Measurement and assessment===

Since the early years of the 2000s (decade),{{When|date=January 2012}} efforts have been conducted in the research and international development community to assess and measure the quality of governance of countries all around the [[world]]. Measuring governance is inherently a controversial and somewhat political exercise. A distinction is therefore made between external assessments, peer assessments and self-assessments. Examples of external assessments are donor assessments or comparative indices produced by international non-governmental organizations. An example of a peer assessment is the [[African Peer Review Mechanism]]. Examples of self-assessments are [http://gaportal.org/country-initiatives country-led assessments] that can be led by government, civil society, researchers and/or other stakeholders at the national level.

One of these efforts to create an internationally comparable measure of governance and an example of an external assessment is the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project, developed by members of the World Bank and the [[World Bank Institute]]. The project reports aggregate and individual indicators for more than 200 countries for six dimensions of governance: voice and accountability, political stability and lack of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, [[rule of law]], control of corruption. To complement the macro-level cross-country Worldwide Governance Indicators, the World Bank Institute developed the [[World Bank Governance Surveys]], which are country-level governance assessment tools that operate at the micro or sub-national level and use information gathered from a country’s own citizens, business people and public sector workers to diagnose governance vulnerabilities and suggest concrete approaches for fighting corruption.

A Worldwide Governance Index (WGI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article469 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144807/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article469 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 4 October 2011 | year =  | title = World Governance Index 2009 Report | publisher = World Governance | accessdate = 3 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed in 2009 and is open for improvement through public participation. The following domains, in the form of indicators and composite indexes, were selected to achieve the development of the WGI: Peace and Security, Rule of Law, Human Rights and Participation, Sustainable Development, and Human Development. Additionally, in 2009 the Bertelsmann Foundation published the [[Sustainable Governance Indicators]] (SGI), which systematically measure the need for reform and the capacity for reform within the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) countries. The project examines to what extent governments can identify, formulate and implement effective reforms that render a society well-equipped to meet future challenges, and ensure their future viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl = http://www.sgi-network.de/index.php?page=mission  | accessdate = | last = Empter  | first1 = Stefan  | first2 = Josef | last2 = Janning  | chapter=Sustainable Governance Indicators 2009 – An Introduction | editor-first  = Bertelsmann | editor-last = Stiftung | year = 2009| title = Policy Performance and Executive Capacity in the OECD | location = Gütersloh | publisher = Verlag Bertelsmann Stiftung}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20160413110418/http://xml.fido.gov/stratml/references/PL111-532StratML.htm#SEC10 Section 10] of the [[Government Performance and Results Act]] (GPRA) Modernization Act requires U.S. federal agencies to publish their strategic and performance plans and reports in machine-readable format.

The International Budget Partnership (IBP) launched the [http://internationalbudget.org/what-we-do/major-ibp-initiatives/open-budget-initiative/ Open Budget Initiative] in 2006 with the release of the first [http://internationalbudget.org/what-we-do/open-budget-survey/ Open Budget Survey (OBS)]. The OBS is a comprehensive analysis and survey that evaluates whether central governments give the public access to budget documents and provide opportunities for public participation in the budget process. To measure the overall commitment to transparency, the IBP created [http://survey.internationalbudget.org/#rankings Open Budget Index] (OBI), which assigns a score to each country based on the results of the survey. While the OBS is released biannually, the IBP recently released a new [http://www.obstracker.org/ OBS Tracker], which serves as an online tool for civil society, the media, and other actors to monitor in real time whether governments are releasing eight key budget documents.

Publishing performance reports openly on the Web in a standard, machine-readable format is good practice for all organizations whose plans and reports should be matters of public record.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3773">The '''Heinz dilemma''' is a frequently used example in many ethics and morality classes. One well-known version of the dilemma, used in [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]'s [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]], is stated as follows:

A woman was on her deathbed. There was one drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to produce. He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about $1,000 which is half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said: “No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from it.” So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's laboratory to steal the drug for his wife. Should Heinz have broken into the laboratory to steal the drug for his wife? Why or why not?&lt;ref name="philmoral"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohlberg |first=Lawrence |title= Essays on Moral Development, Vol. I: The Philosophy of Moral Development |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=San Francisco, CA |year=1981 |isbn=0-06-064760-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a theoretical point of view, it is not important what the participant thinks that Heinz should ''do''. Kohlberg's theory holds that the justification the participant offers is what is significant, the ''form'' of their response. Below are some of many examples of possible arguments that belong to the six stages:

* Stage one (''obedience''): Heinz should not steal the medicine because he will consequently be put in prison which will mean he is a bad person. 
: Or: Heinz should steal the medicine because it is only worth $200 and not how much the druggist wanted for it; Heinz had even offered to pay for it and was not stealing anything else.
* Stage two (''self-interest''): Heinz should steal the medicine because he will be much happier if he saves his wife, even if he will have to serve a prison sentence.
: Or: Heinz should not steal the medicine because prison is an awful place, and he would more likely languish in a jail cell than over his wife's death.
* Stage three (''conformity''): Heinz should steal the medicine because his wife expects it; he wants to be a good husband.
: Or: Heinz should not steal the drug because stealing is bad and he is not a criminal; he has tried to do everything he can without breaking the law, you cannot blame him.
* Stage four (''law-and-order''): Heinz should not steal the medicine because the law prohibits stealing, making it illegal.
: Or: Heinz should steal the drug for his wife but also take the prescribed punishment for the crime as well as paying the druggist what he is owed. Criminals cannot just run around without regard for the law; actions have consequences.
* Stage five (''human rights''): Heinz should steal the medicine because everyone has a right to choose life, regardless of the law.
: Or: Heinz should not steal the medicine because the scientist has a right to fair compensation. Even if his wife is sick, it does not make his actions right.
* Stage six (''universal human ethics''): Heinz should steal the medicine, because saving a human life is a more fundamental value than the property rights of another person.
: Or: Heinz should not steal the medicine, because others may need the medicine just as badly, and their lives are equally significant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3284">'''Hermann Reinheimer''' (born, 1872) was a British [[biologist]] and early science writer who proposed [[Co-operation (evolution)|cooperation in evolution]] and [[symbiogenesis]].

==Biography==

Reinheimer was a critic of Darwinian view of [[struggle for existence]]. He was the author of ''Evolution by Cooperation'' (1913) and ''Symbiogenesis'' (1915) which were influential in developing the concept of [[symbiosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hankins, F. H. (1914). ''Evolution by Cooperation by Hermann Reinheimer''. ''[[The Journal of Race Development]]''. Vol. 5, No. 1. p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowler, Peter J. (2001). ''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain''. University of Chicago Press. p. 145. {{ISBN|0-226-06858-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to science historian [[Jan Sapp]] "Reinheimer is virtually unknown among contemporary biologists and historians."&lt;ref&gt;Sapp, Jan (1994). ''Evolution by Association : A History of Symbiosis: A History of Symbiosis''. Oxford University Press. pp. 60-61. {{ISBN|0-19-508821-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1915, Reinheimer was one of the first writers to discuss [[symbiogenesis]]. However, the term was used without reference to [[Konstantin Mereschkowski]] who had previously written on the subject, leading cell biologist Francisco Carrapiço to speculate that Reinheimer was unfamiliar with his work.&lt;ref name="Carrapiço 2015"&gt;Carrapiço, Francisco. (2015). ''Can We Understand Evolution Without Symbiogenesis?'' In Nathalie Gontier. ''Reticulate Evolution: Symbiogenesis, Lateral Gene Transfer, Hybridization and Infectious Heredity''. Springer. pp. 81-106. {{ISBN|978-3-319-16344-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reinheimer's views on symbiogenesis were seen as controversial during his time.&lt;ref&gt;Bio-Morality. Review of Symbiogenesis: The Universal Law Of Progressive Evolution by H. Reinheimer. ''[[The BMJ|The British Medical Journal]]''. Vol. 1, No. 2933. (Mar. 17, 1917), pp. 365-366.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, American zoologist [[William Lawrence Tower]] described his book ''Symbiogenesis'' as the "least logical, worst constructed, most inaccurate and irrational book upon evolution that has happened in a long time."&lt;ref&gt;Tower, William L. (1916). ''Symbiogenesis: The Universal Law of Progressive Evolution. by Hermann Reinheimer''. ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]''. Vol. 21, No. 5, pp. 695-696.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little about his life is known, he was described as living in [[Surbiton|Surbiton, London]] until the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Carrapiço 2015"/&gt;

'''Historicity''' in [[philosophy]] is the idea or fact that something has a historical origin and developed through history: concepts, practices, values. This is opposed to the belief that the same thing, in particular [[normative]] [[institution]]s or correlated [[ideology|ideologies]], are [[nature|natural]] or [[essence|essential]] and thus exist [[Cultural universal|universally]].

Historicity relates to the underlying concept of [[history]], or the intersection of [[teleology]] (the concept and study of progress and purpose), [[temporality]] (the concept of time), and [[historiography]] ([[semiotics]] and history of [[history]]). Varying conceptualizations of historicity emphasize linear progress or the repetition or modulation of past events.{{cn|date=October 2013}}

== Concepts of historicity ==
In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], historicity is the history of constitution of any [[intentionality|intentional]] object, both in the sense of history as [[tradition]] and in the sense where every individual has its own history. Of course, these two senses are often very similar: One individual's history is heavily influenced by the tradition the individual is formed in, but personal history can also produce an object that wouldn't be a part of any tradition. In addition, personal historicity doesn't develop in the same way as tradition.

[[Martin Heidegger]] argued in ''[[Being and Time]]'' that it is temporality that gives rise to history. All things have their place and time, and nothing past is outside of history. [[Ingo Farin]] agues that Heidegger appropriated the concept from [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and from [[Paul Yorck von Wartenburg]] &lt;ref&gt;Farin, Ingo. "Three levels of historical analysis in early Heidegger." The New Yearbook for Phenomenology and Phenomenological Philosophy XII XII (2013): 1-37.&lt;/ref&gt; and further clarifies Heidegger's meaning: 

: ''Heidegger calls authentic historicity the historical awareness that recognizes this whole range (i.e., the “simultaneity” of past, present, and future in the historical action one resolves to undertake).''

[[Francis Fukuyama]], in ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'', famously argued that the collapse of [[Soviet communism]] brought humanity to the "end of history" whereby the world's global dialectical machinations had been resolved with the triumph of liberal capitalism.

Before Fukuyama, [[Jean Baudrillard]] argued for a different concept of the "end of history". Baudrillard's most in-depth writings on the notion of historicity are found in the books ''Fatal Strategies'' and ''The Illusion of the End''. It is for these writings that he received a full-chapter denunciation from the physicist [[Alan Sokal]] (along with [[Jean Bricmont]]), due to his alleged misuse of physical concepts of linear time, space and stability. In contrast to Fukuyama's argument, Baudrillard maintained that the "end of history", in terms of a [[teleology|teleological]] goal, had always been an illusion brought about by modernity's will towards progress, civilisation and rational unification. And this was an illusion that to all intents and purposes vanished toward the end of the 20th century, brought about by the "speed" at which society moved, effectively "destabilising" the linear progression of history (it is these comments, specifically, that provoked Sokal's criticism). History was, so to speak, outpaced by its own spectacular realisation. As Baudrillard himself caustically put it:

:''The end of history is, alas, also the end of the dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for disposing of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. Where are we going to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history,'' this is because History itself has become a dustbin. ''It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.''&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baudrillard, ''The Illusion of the End'', 1994, p. 26; also in Jean Baudrillard, ''Selected Writings'', 2001, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach to history is what marks out Baudrillard's affinities with the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] philosophy of [[Jean-François Lyotard]]: the idea that society — and Western society in particular — has "dropped out" of the grand narratives of history (for example, the coming of Communism, or the triumph of civilised modern society). But Baudrillard has supplemented this argument by contending that, although this "dropping out" may have taken place, the global world (which in Baudrillard's writing is sharply distinct from a [[universal humanity]]) is, in accordance with its spectacular understanding of itself, condemned to "play out" this illusory ending in a hyper-teleological way — acting out the end of the end of the end, ''ad infinitum''. Thus Baudrillard argues that — in a manner similar to that of [[Giorgio Agamben]]'s book ''Means without Ends'' — Western society is subject to the political restriction of means that are justified by ends that do not exist.

[[Michel-Rolph Trouillot]] offers a different insight into the meaning and uses of historicity. Trouillot explains, "The ways in which what happened, and what is said to have happened are and are not the same may itself be historical".

'''''Sharaf''''' and '''''ird''''' are [[Bedouin]] honor codes. Along with [[hospitality]] and [[courage|courage/bravery]], it is one of the Bedouin aspects of [[ethics]].&lt;ref name = "patai"&gt;Patai, Raphael. ''[[The Arab Mind]]''. Charles Scribner's Sons: New York, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bedouin systems of justice]] are based on these [[honor code]]s, although the codes are falling into disuse as more Bedouins accept [[sharia]] or national [[penal code]]s as the means for dispensing justice.

==Ird==

''Ird'' is the Bedouin honor code for women. A woman is born with her ''ird'' intact, but sexual transgression can take her ''ird'' away. It is different from [[virginity]], as it is emotional and conceptual. Once lost, ''ird'' cannot be regained.&lt;ref name = "patai"/&gt; 

==Sharaf==
''Sharaf'' is the general Bedouin honor code for men. It can be acquired, augmented, lost, and regained. ''Sharaf'' involves protection of the ''ird'' of the women of the family, protection of [[property]], and maintenance of the honor of the tribe and protection of the village (if the tribe has [[human settlement|settled]]).&lt;ref name = "patai"/&gt;

==Diyafa==

'''''Diyafa''''' (hospitality) is a virtue closely linked to ''sharaf''. If required, even an enemy must be given shelter and fed for some days. [[Poverty]] does not exempt one from one's duties in this regard. [[Generosity]] is a related virtue, and in many Bedouin societies, gifts must be offered and cannot be declined. The destitute are looked after by the community, and [[tithe|tithing]] is mandatory in many Bedouin societies.&lt;ref name = "blake"&gt;Blake, Martha. ''[http://www.marthablake.com/ghinnawa.html The Ghinnawa: How Bedouin Women's Poetry Supplements Social Expression]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hamasa==

'''''Hamasa''''' (courage/bravery) is also closely linked to ''sharaf''. Bravery indicates the willingness to defend one's tribe for the purpose of '''''aṣabīya''''' (tribal solidarity and balance). It is closely related to '''''muruwa''''' ([[Masculinity|manliness]]). It usually entails the ability to withstand pain, including (male) [[circumcision]].&lt;ref name = "blake"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13149">{{for|the 1976 book|The Hunting Hypothesis}}
In [[paleoanthropology]], the '''hunting hypothesis''' is the hypothesis that [[human evolution]] was primarily influenced by the activity of [[hunting]] for relatively large and fast animals, and that the activity of  hunting  distinguished human ancestors from other [[hominins]].

While it is undisputed that early humans were hunters, the importance of this fact for the final steps in the emergence of the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' out of earlier [[australopithecines]], with its [[bipedalism]] and production of [[stone tool]]s (from about 2.5 million years ago), and eventually also [[control of fire]] (from about 1.5 million years ago), are emphasized in the "hunting hypothesis", and de-emphasized in scenarios that stress the [[omnivore]] status of humans as their recipe for success, and [[social interaction]], including [[mating|mating behaviour]] as essential in the emergence of language and culture.

Advocates of the hunting hypothesis tend to believe that [[tool]] use and toolmaking essential to effective hunting were an extremely important part of human evolution, and trace the  [[origin of language]] and [[prehistoric religion|religion]] to a hunting context.

As societal evidence Buss cites that modern tribal population deploy hunting as their primary way of acquiring food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buss|first1=David|title=Evolutionary Psychology: The new Science of the Mind.|date=1999|publisher=Needham Heights: Allyn &amp; Bacon.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aka people|Aka pygmies]] in the [[Central African Republic]] spend 56% of their quest for nourishment hunting, 27% gathering, and 17% processing food. Additionally, the [[!Kung]] in Botswana retain 40% of their calories from hunting and this percentage varies from 20% to 90% depending on the season.&lt;ref name="Buss"&gt;Buss, David M. Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2011. Print. 80&lt;/ref&gt;  For physical evidence Buss first looks to the guts of humans and apes.  The human gut consists mainly of the small [[intestines]], which are responsible for the rapid breakdown of proteins and absorption of nutrients. The ape’s gut is primarily [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], which indicates a vegetarian diet. This structural difference supports the hunting hypothesis in being an evolutionary branching point between modern humans and modern primates. Buss also cites human teeth in that fossilized human teeth have a thin enamel coating with very little heavy wear and tear that would result from a plant diet. The absence of thick enamel also indicates that historically humans have maintained a meat-heavy diet.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;  Buss notes that the bones of animals human ancestors killed found at Olduvai Gorge have cut marks at strategic points on the bones that indicate tool usage and provide evidence for ancestral butchers.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;

==Applications ==
===[[Sexual division of labor (evolutionary perspective)]]===
According to the hunting hypothesis, women are preoccupied with pregnancy and dependent children and so do not hunt because it is dangerous and less profitable. Gijsbert Stoet highlights the fact that men are more competent in throwing skills, focused attention, and spatial abilities. (Experiments 1 and 2).&lt;ref name = "Stoet"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = Gisbert | year = 2011 | title = Sex Differences in Search and Gathering Skills | url = | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 416–22 | doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2011.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible explanation for women gathering is their inherent prioritization of rearing offspring, which is difficult to uphold if women were hunting.&lt;ref name="Stoet"/&gt;

==Provisioning hypothesis==
===Parental investment===
Buss purports that the hunting hypothesis explains the high level of human male parental investment in offspring as compared to primates. Meat is an economical and condensed food resource in that it can be brought home to feed the young, however it is not efficient to carry low-calorie food across great distances. Thus, the act of hunting and the required transportation of the kill in order to feed offspring is a reasonable explanation for human male provisioning.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;

===Male coalitions===
Buss suggests that the Hunting hypothesis also explains the advent of strong male coalitions. Although chimpanzees form male-male coalitions, they tend to be temporary and opportunistic. Contrastingly, large game hunters require consistent and coordinated cooperation to succeed in large game hunting. Thus male coalitions were the result of working together to succeed in providing meat for the hunters themselves and their families.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; Kristen Hawkes suggests further that obtaining resources intended for community consumption increases a male’s fitness by appealing to the male’s society and thus being in the good favor of both males and females. The male relationship would improve hunting success and create alliances for future conflict and the female relationship would improve direct reproductive success.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; 
Buss proposes alternate explanations of emergence of the strong male coalitions. He suggests that male coalitions may have been the result of group-on-group aggression, defense, and in-group political alliances. This explanation does not support the relationship between male coalitions and hunting.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;

Hawkes proposes that hunters pursue large game and divide the kill across the group. Hunters compete to divvy up the kill to signal courage, power, generosity, prosocial intent, and dedication. By engaging in these activities, hunters receive reproductive benefits and respect.&lt;ref name = "Nolin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nolin | first1 = David A | year = 2010 | title = Food-Sharing Networks in Lamalera, Indonesia | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513811001188 | journal = Human Nature | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 243–68 | doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2011.11.003| pmc = 3398706 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These reproductive benefits lead to greater reproductive success in more skilled hunters.&lt;ref name = "Nolin"/&gt; Evidence of these hunting goals that do not only benefit the families of the hunters are in the [[Aché people|Ache]] and [[Hadza people|Hadza]] men. Hawkes notes that their hunting techniques are less efficient than alternative methods and are energetically costly, but the men place more importance on displaying their bravery, power, and prosocial intent than on hunting efficiency. This method is different as compared to other societies where hunters retain the control of their kills and signal their intent of sharing. This alternate method aligns with the coalition support hypothesis, in efforts to create and preserve political associations.&lt;ref name = "Nolin"/&gt;

===Reciprocal altruism===
The meat from successful large game hunts are more than what a single hunter can consume. Further, hunting success varies by week. One week a hunter may succeed in hunting large game and the next may return with no meat. In this situation Buss suggests that there are low costs to giving away meat that cannot be eaten by the individual hunter on his own and large benefits from the expectation of the returned favor in a week where his hunting is not successful.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; Hawkes calls this sharing “tolerated theft” and purports that the benefits of reciprocal altruism stem from the result that families will experience “lower daily variation and higher daily average” in their resources.&lt;ref name = "Hawkes"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkes | first1 = Kristen | year = 1991 | title = Showing Off Tests of an Hypothesis About Men's Foraging Goals | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016230959190011E | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 29–54 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(91)90011-E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provisioning may actually be a form of sexual competition between males for females.&lt;ref name = "Norton"&gt;Larsen, Clark S. "Early Hominid Origins and Evolution: The Roots of Humanity." Chapter 10:. W.W. Norton &amp; Company, n.d. Web. 15 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.wwnorton.com/college/anthro/our-origins2/ch/10/outline.aspx&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkes suggests that male provisioning is a particularly human behavior, which forges the nuclear family.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; The structure of familial provisioning determines a form of resource distribution. However, Hawkes does acknowledge inconsistencies across societies and contexts such as the fluctuating time courses dedicated to hunting and gathering, which are not directly correlated with return rates, the fact that nutrition value is often chosen over caloric count, and the fact that meat is a more widely spread resource than other resources.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt;

===The show-off hypothesis===
The show-off hypothesis is the concept that more successful men have better mate options. The idea relates back to the fact that meat, the result of hunting expeditions, is a distinct resource in that it comes in large quantities that more often than not the hunter’s own family is not able to consume in a timely manner so that the meat doesn’t go sour.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; Also the success of hunting is unpredictable whereas berries and fruits, unless there is a drought or a bad bush, are fairly consistent in seasonality. Kristen Hawkes argues that women favor neighbors opting for men who provide the advantageous, yet infrequent meat feasts.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; These women may profit from alliance and the resulting feasts, especially in times of shortage. Hawkes suggests that it would be beneficial for women to reward men who employ the “show-off strategy” by supporting them in a dispute, caring for their offspring, or providing sexual favors.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; The benefits women may gain from their alignment lie in favored treatment of the offspring spawned by the show-off from neighbors.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; Buss echoes and cites Hawke’s thoughts on the show-off’s benefits in sexual access, increased likelihood of having children, and the favorable treatment his children would receive from the other members of the society.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; Hawkes also suggests that show-offs are more likely to live in large groups and thus be less susceptible to predators.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; Show-offs gain more benefits from just sharing with their family (classical fitness) in the potential favorable treatment from the community and reciprocal altruism from other members of the community.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt;

Hawkes uses the Ache people of Paraguay as evidence for the Show-off hypothesis. Food acquired by men was more widely distributed across the community and inconsistent resources that came in large quantities when acquired were also more widely shared.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt;

While this is represented in the Ache according to Hawkes, Buss notes that this trend is contradicted in the Hadza who evenly distribute the meat across all members of their population and whose hunters have very little control over the distribution. In the Hadza the show-off hypothesis does not have to do with the resources that result from hunting, but from the prestige and risk that is involved in big game hunting. There are possible circuitous benefits such as protection and defense.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;  
&lt;!-- The following is not a sentence and does not carry a message - please complete if possible.
Why hunters forge male coalitions, even though the hunter’s personal return rate is lower and hunters eat less of their own kill than other family and community members.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt;--&gt;

== Imitative learning in animals ==
On the most basic level, research performed by A.L. Saggerson, David N. George, and R.C. Honey showed that [[Columbidae|pigeons]] were able to learn a basic process that would lead to the delivery of a reward by watching a demonstrator pigeon.&lt;ref&gt;Saggerson, George, &amp; Honey.  (2005).  Journal of Experimental Psychology Animal Behavior Processes, 31 (3), 289 –300.&lt;/ref&gt;  A demonstrator pigeon was trained to peck a panel in response to one [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] (e.g. a red light) and hop on the panel in response to a second stimulus (e.g. a green light).  After proficiency in this task was established in the demonstrator pigeon, other learner pigeons were placed in a video-monitored observation chamber.  After every second observed trial, these learner pigeons were then individually placed in the demonstrator pigeon's box and presented the same test.  The learner pigeons displayed competent performance on the task, and thus it was concluded that the learner pigeons had formed a response-outcome association while observing.  However, the researchers noted that an alternative interpretation of these results could be that the learner pigeons had instead acquired outcome-response associations that guided their behavior and that further testing was needed to establish if this was a valid alternative.

A '''leap of faith''', in its most commonly used meaning, is the act of [[belief|believing]] in or accepting something outside the boundaries of [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/leap-of-faith Leap of faith]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{see also|Jumping to conclusions}}
The phrase is commonly attributed to [[Søren Kierkegaard]]; however, he never used the term, as he referred to a ''qualitative leap''. A leap of faith according to Kierkegaard involves [[circular reasoning|circularity]] insofar as the leap is made ''by'' faith.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;Hannay, Alastair, and Gordon Marino. (eds.) ''The Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard''. Cambridge, {{ISBN|0-521-47719-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]'', he describes the core part of the leap of faith: the leap. “Thinking can turn toward itself in order to think about itself and [[skepticism]] can emerge. But this thinking about itself never accomplishes anything.” Kierkegaard says thinking should serve by thinking something. Kierkegaard wants to stop "[[Critique of Pure Reason|thinking's self-reflection]]" and that is the movement that constitutes a leap.&lt;ref&gt;Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Hong p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; He is against people thinking about religion all day without ever doing anything; but he is also against external shows and opinions about religion. Instead, Kierkegaard is in favor of the internal movement of faith.&lt;ref&gt;''Fear and Trembling/Repetition,'' 1843, Hong p. 68ff, ''Practice In Christianity'', Hong p. 133ff ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 607ff&lt;/ref&gt; He says, "where Christianity wants to have inwardness, worldly Christendom wants outwardness, and where [[Christianity]] wants outwardness, worldly [[Christendom]] wants inwardness."&lt;ref&gt;Works of Love, Hong p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; But, on the other hand, he also says: "The less externality, the more inwardness if it is truly there; but it is also the case that the less externality, the greater the possibility that the inwardness will entirely fail to come. The externality is the watchman who awakens the sleeper; the externality is the solicitous mother who calls one; the externality is the roll call that brings the soldier to his feet; the externality is the reveille that helps one to make the great effort; but the absence of the externality can mean that the inwardness itself calls inwardly to a person - alas - but it can also mean that the inwardness will fail to come."&lt;ref&gt;Concluding Postscript, p. 382, Hong translation&lt;/ref&gt;  The "most dreadful thing of all is a personal existence that cannot [[:wikt:coalesce|coalesce]] in a conclusion,"&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, Stages on Life's Way, Hong p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; according to Kierkegaard. He asked his contemporaries if any of them had reached a conclusion about anything or did every new [[premise]] change their convictions.

[[David F. Swenson (translator)|David F. Swenson]] described the leap in his 1916 article The Anti-Intellectualism of Kierkegaard using some of Kierkegaard's ideas. {{Quotation|H2 plus O becomes water, and water becomes ice, by a leap. The change from motion to rest, or vice versa, is a transition which cannot be logically construed; this is the basic principle of Zeno's dialectic, and is also expressed in Newton's laws of motion, since the external force by which such change is effected is not a consequence of the law, but is premised as external to the system with which we start. It is therefore transcendent and non-rational, and its coming into existence can only be apprehended as a leap. In the same manner, every causal system presupposes an external environment as the condition of change. Every transition from the detail of an empirical induction to the ideality and universality of law, is a leap. In the actual process of thinking, we have the leap by which we arrive at the understanding of an idea or an author.   The Anti-Intellectualism of Kierkegaard, by David F. Swenson, [https://archive.org/stream/philosophicalrev25cornuoft#page/576/mode/2up The Philosophical Review V. XXV 1916 p. 577-578]}}

This is how the leap was described in 1950 and then in 1960. {{Quotation|Kierkegaard agreed with Lessing, a German dynamist, that truth lies in the search for an object, not in the object sought. It is another case of “act accomplishing itself.” If God held truth in one hand and the eternal pursuit of it in the other, He would choose the second hand according to Lessing. Religious truth concerns the individual and the individual alone, and it is the personal mode of appropriation, the process of realization, the subjective dynamism that counts. Of Lessing, Kierkegaard writes approvingly. But if we are constantly occupied in the immanent striving of our own subjectivity, how are we to ascend to knowledge of a transcendent God whom traditional thought declares to be known even by reason. Lessing and Kierkegaard declare in typical fashion that there is no bridge between historical, finite knowledge and God’s existence and nature. This gap can only be crossed by a “leap.” Faith is a completely irrational experience, and yet it is, paradoxically, the highest duty of a Christian. Though as Thomte observes, it is not a spontaneous belief, faith is nevertheless something blind, immediate, and decisive. It has the character of an “act of resignation.” It is unmediated and a-intellectual, much like Kant’s proof for the existence of God. Nature makes no leaps, according to the maxim of Leibniz. But faith, according to Kierkegaard must do so in a radical way.  ''Idea-Men of Today'' by Vincent Edward Smith 1950 p. 254-255&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009946721 ''Idea-Men of Today'' by Vincent Edward Smith 1950]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{Quotation|Like Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, who plays an important role in the spiritual struggle for meaning on the part of the modern writer, cast off the bondage of logic and the tyranny of science. By means of the dialectic of "the leap," he attempted to transcend both the aesthetic and the ethical stages. Completely alone, cut off from his fellow-men, the individual realizes his own nothingness as the preliminary condition for embracing the truth of God. Only when man becomes aware of his own non-entity — an experience that is purely subjective and incommunicable — does he recover his real self and stand in the presence of God. This is the mystique which has been rediscovered by twentieth-century man, the leap from outwardness to inwardness, from rationalism to subjectivity, the revelation, that is ineffable, of the reality of the Absolute.  ''Literature and Religion: a Study in Conflict'' 1960 by Charles Irving Glicksberg p. 12&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/literaturereligi00glic Literature and religion: a study in conflict]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The leap into sin and into faith==
Kierkegaard describes "the leap" using the famous story of Adam and Eve, particularly Adam's qualitative ''leap'' into sin. Adam's leap signifies a change from one quality to another, mainly the quality of possessing no sin to the quality of possessing sin. Kierkegaard maintains that the transition from one quality to another can take place only by a "leap" (Thomte 232). When the transition happens, one moves directly from one state to the other, never possessing both qualities. "The moment is related to the transition of the one to the many, of the many to the one, of likeness to unlikeness, and that it is the moment in which there is neither one nor many, neither a being determined nor a being combined."(Thomte Note 82-85). "In the Moment man becomes conscious that he is born; for his antecedent state, to which he may not cling, was one of non-being. In the Moment man also becomes conscious of the new birth, for his antecedent state was one of non-being."&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, Philosophical Fragments p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mendelssohn-Lessing Kupferstich.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Johann Kaspar Lavater]] (right) trying to convert [[Moses Mendelssohn]] to Christianity as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] looks on.]]Kierkegaard felt that a leap of faith was vital in accepting [[Christianity]] due to the paradoxes that exist in Christianity. In his books, ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'' and ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]'', Kierkegaard delves deeply into the paradoxes that Christianity presents. Moses Mendelssohn did the same thing when Johann Kaspar Lavater demanded he discuss why he didn't want to become a Christian. Both Kierkegaard and Mendelssohn knew the difficulties involved when discussing religious topics: &lt;blockquote&gt;"As I so sedulously sought to avoid an explanation in my own apartment amidst a small number of worthy men, of whose good intentions I had every reason to be persuaded, it might have been reasonably inferred that a public one would be extremely repugnant to my disposition; and that I must have inevitably become the more embarrassed when the voice demanding it happened to be entitled to an answer at any rate." Moses Mendelssohn, Letter to J. C. Lavater,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/prosewritersofge00hedguoft#page/102/mode/1up Letter to Lavater]&lt;/ref&gt;  December 12, 1769&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kierkegaard's use of the term "leap" was in response to "Lessing's Ditch" which was discussed by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (1729–1781) in his theological writings.&lt;ref&gt;Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, "On the proof of the spirit and of power" (1777), in ''Philosophical and Theological Writings'', translated and edited by H. B. Nisbet, Cambridge University Press 2005, pp. 83-88. See ''Concluding Postscript'', Hong p. 61ff and 93ff; see also Benton 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard was indebted to Lessing's writings in many ways. Lessing tried to battle rational Christianity directly and, when that failed, he battled it indirectly through, what Kierkegaard called, "imaginary constructions".&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Vol I, Hong p. 114, 263-266, 381, 512, 617 See Lessing's [[Nathan the Wise]] [https://archive.org/details/nathanthewiseadr03820gut Nathan the Wise] Archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; Both may be indebted to [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

Rousseau used the idea in his 1762 book ''Emile'' like this: {{Quotation|If I relate the plain and simple tale of their innocent affections you will accuse me of frivolity, but you will be mistaken. Sufficient attention is not given to the effect which the first connection between man and woman is bound to produce on the future life of both. People do not see that a first impression so vivid as that of love, or the liking which takes the place of love, produces lasting effects whose influence continues till death. Works on education are crammed with wordy and unnecessary accounts of the imaginary duties of children; but there is not a word about the most important and most difficult part of their education, the crisis which forms the bridge between the child and the man. If any part of this work is really useful, it will be because I have dwelt at great length on this matter, so essential in itself and so neglected by other authors, and because I have not allowed myself to be discouraged either by false delicacy or by the difficulties of expression. The story of human nature is a fair romance. Am I to blame if it is not found elsewhere? I am trying to write the history of mankind. If my book is a romance, the fault lies with those who deprave mankind.

This is supported by another reason; we are not dealing with a youth given over from childhood to fear, greed, envy, pride, and all those passions which are the common tools of the schoolmaster; we have to do with a youth who is not only in love for the first time, but with one who is also experiencing his first passion of any kind; very likely it will be the only strong passion he will ever know, and upon it depends the final formation of his character. His mode of thought, his feelings, his tastes, determined by a lasting passion, are about to become so fixed that they will be incapable of further change.
 ''Emile'' by Jean Jacques Rousseau, Foxley translation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5427 ''Emile'' by Jean Jacques Rousseau, Foxley translation]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724-1804) used the term in his 1784 essay, ''[[Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?]]'' Kant wrote: {{Quotation|Dogmas and formulas, these mechanical tools designed for reasonable use--or rather abuse--of his natural gifts, are the fetters of an everlasting [[nonage]]. The man who casts them off would make an uncertain leap over the narrowest ditch, because he is not used to such free movement. That is why there are only a few men who walk firmly, and who have emerged from nonage by cultivating their own minds. It is more nearly possible, however, for the public to [[Age of Enlightenment|enlighten]] itself; indeed, if it is only given freedom, enlightenment is almost inevitable. There will always be a few independent thinkers, even among the self-appointed guardians of the multitude. Once such men have thrown off the yoke of nonage, they will spread about them the spirit of a reasonable appreciation of man's value and of his duty to think for himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/CCREAD/etscc/kant.html What is Enlightenment]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lessing said, "[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/accidental accidental] truths of history can never become the proof of necessary truths of reason." Kierkegaard points out that he also said, "[[contingent]] truths of history can never become the [[Scientific demonstration|demonstrations]] of [[Logical truth|necessary]] truths of [[reason]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Lessing's Theological Writings'', On the Proof of the Spirit and of Power, Chadwick, p. 53, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Vol 1 p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard liked Lessing because he "had a most uncommon gift of explaining what he himself had understood. With that he stopped; in our day people go further and explain more than they themselves have understood."&lt;ref&gt;Fear and Trembling, note p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quotation|We all believe that an Alexander lived who in a short time conquered almost all Asia. But who, on the basis of this belief, would risk anything of great permanent worth, the loss of which would be irreparable? Who, in consequence of this belief, would forswear for ever all knowledge that conflicted with this belief? Certainly not I. Now I have no objection to raise against Alexander and his victory: but it might still be possible that the story was founded on a mere poem of [[Choerilus of Samos|Choerilus]] just as the twenty year siege of Troy depends on no better [[authority]] than Homer's poetry. If on historical grounds I have no objection to the statement that Christ raised to life a dead man; must I therefore accept it as true that God has a Son who is the same essence as himself? ''On The Proof of the Spirit and of Power'', Lessing's Theological Writings, Chadwick p. 51-56&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.tcu.edu/grant/hhit/Lessing.pdf Lessing, ''On The Proof of the Spirit and of Power'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;}}  {{Quotation|Lessing opposes what I would call quantifying oneself into a qualitative decision; he contests the direct transition from historical reliability to a decision on an eternal happiness. He does not deny that what is said in the Scriptures about miracles and prophecies is just as reliable as other historical reports, in fact, is as reliable as historical reports in general can be. But now, if they are only as reliable as this why are they treated as if they were infinitely more reliable-precisely because one wants to base on them the acceptance of a doctrine that is the condition for an eternal happiness, that is, to base an eternal happiness on them. Like everyone else, Lessing is willing to believe that an Alexander who subjugated all of Asia did live once, but who, on the basis of this belief, would risk anything of great, permanent worth, the loss of which would be irreparable? Søren Kierkegaard ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 96, 130-131}}

Kierkegaard has [[Don Juan]] in ''[[Either/Or]]'' escort young girls "all in the dangerous age of being neither grown-up nor children" to "the other side of the ditch of life" as he, himself, "dances over the abyss" only to "instantly sink down into the depths."&lt;ref&gt;Either/Or Part I, Swenson p. 107, 128-129, 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; He has Don Juan "preach the gospel of pleasure" to Elvira and seduces her from the convent and wonders if there is a priest who can "preach the gospel of repentance and remorse" with the same power as Don Juan preached his gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Either/Or Part I, Swenson p. 191-197&lt;/ref&gt; Both Lessing and Kierkegaard are discussing the [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] one might use to base one's faith upon. Does history provide all the proofs necessary to cross that "ugly, broad ditch"?&lt;ref&gt;Lessing, Theological Writings p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Or is there "no direct and immediate transition to Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;Concluding Unscientific Postscript Vol I, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  Does one become a Christian "in the fulness of time" as Kierkegaard puts it&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Philosophical Fragments'' p. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; or is "there only one [[Historical Jesus|proof]] of spirit and that is the spirit’s proof within oneself. Whoever demands something else may get proofs in superabundance, but he is already characterized at spiritless."&lt;ref&gt;The Concept of Anxiety, Nichol, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

He also writes about this in his ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]'': {{Quotation|If naked dialectical deliberation shows that there is no approximation, that wanting to [[Quantification (science)|quantify]] oneself into faith along this path is a misunderstanding, a delusion, that wanting to concern oneself with such deliberations is a temptation for the believer, a temptation that he, keeping himself in the passion of faith, must resist with all his strength, lest it end with his succeeding in changing faith into something else, into another kind of certainty, in substituting probabilities and guarantees, which were rejected when he, himself beginning, made the [[Qualitative property|qualitative]] transition of the leap from unbeliever to believer - if this is so, then everyone who, not entirely unfamiliar with learned scientificity and not bereft of willingness to learn, has understood it this way must also have felt his hard-pressed position when he in admiration learned to think meanly of his own insignificance in the face of those distinguished by learning and acumen and deserved renown, so that, seeking the fault in himself, he time and again returned to them, and when in despondency he had to admit that he himself was in the right. .... When someone is to leap he must certainly do it alone and also be alone in properly understanding that it is an impossibility. … the leap is the [[Decision making|decision]]. .... I am charging the individual in question with not willing to stop the infinity of [[Human self-reflection|reflection]]. Am I requiring something of him, then? But on the other hand, in a genuinely [[Speculative reason|speculative]] way, I assume that reflection stops of its own accord. Why, then, do I require something of him? And what do I require of him? I require a [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/resolution resolution]. And in that I am right, for only in that way can reflection be stopped. But, on the other hand, it is never right for a [[philosopher]] to make sport of people and at one moment have reflection stop of its own accord in the absolute beginning, and at the next moment taunt someone who has only one flaw, that he is obtuse enough to believe the first, taunts him so as to help him in this fashion to the absolute beginning, which then occurs two ways. But if a resolution is required, presuppositionlessness is abandoned. The beginning can occur only when reflection is stopped, and reflection can be stopped only by something else, and this something else is something altogether different from the [[logic]]al, since it is a resolution. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'', Hong p. 11-12, 102, 113}}

[[File:Kierkegaard olavius.jpg|thumb|250px]]The implication of taking a ''leap of faith'' can, depending on the context, carry positive or negative connotations, as some feel it is a virtue to be able to believe in something without evidence while others feel it is foolishness. It is a hotly contested [[Theology|theological]] and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] concept. For instance, the association between "blind faith" and religion is disputed by those with [[Deism|deistic]] principles who argue that reason and logic, rather than revelation or tradition, should be the basis of the belief "that God has existed in human form, was born and grew up". Jesus is the "[[paradox]]", the "absolute paradox".&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Vol I, Hong see pages 208-225&lt;/ref&gt; When Christianity becomes a scholarly enterprise one tends to "[[Human self-reflection|reflect]] oneself into Christianity" but Kierkegaard says, one should "reflect oneself out of something else and become, more and more simply, a Christian."&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Point of View'', Lowrie p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kierkegaard portrait.jpg|thumb|left|250px]] Kierkegaard was concerned that individuals would spend all their lives trying to define Christianity, love, God, the Trinity, sin, et cetera, and never get to the business of "actually" making a decision in time to become a Christian who could then act on the basis of that decision. He discussed the inner and the outer relationship existing in belief. "Compared with the Hegelian notion that the outer is the inner and the inner the outer, it certainly is extremely original. But it would be even more original if the Hegelian axiom were not only admired by the present age but also had retroactive power to abolish, backward historically, the distinction between the visible and invisible Church. The invisible Church is not a historical phenomenon; as such it cannot be observed objectively at all, because it is only in subjectivity."&lt;ref&gt;Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Vol I p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; There has to be a balance between objective and subjective knowledge. Hegel went to the extreme objective side so Kierkegaard decided to go to the extreme subjective side.{{Quotation|The decision rests in the subject; the appropriation is the paradoxical inwardness that is specifically different from all other inwardness. Being a Christian is defined not by the “what” of Christianity but by the “how” of the Christian. This “how” can fit only one thing, the absolute paradox. Therefore there is no vague talk that being a Christian means to accept and accept, and accept altogether differently, to appropriate, to have faith, to appropriate in faith altogether differently (nothing but rhetorical and sham definitions); but to have faith is specifically qualified differently from all other appropriation and inwardness. Faith is the objective uncertainty with the repulsion of the absurd, held fast in the passion of inwardness, which is the relation of inwardness intensified to its highest. This formula fits only the one who has faith, no one else, not even a lover, or an enthusiast, or a thinker, but solely and only the one who has faith, who relates himself to the absolute paradox. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Vol I Hong p. 610-611}}

Even some theistic realms of thought do not agree with the implications that this phrase carries. For instance, [[C. S. Lewis]] argues against the idea that Christianity requires a "leap of faith," (as the term is most commonly understood). One of Lewis' arguments is that [[supernatural]]ism, a basic tenet of Christianity, can be logically inferred based on a [[teleological]] argument regarding the source of human reason. Nonetheless, some Christians are less critical of the term and do accept that religion requires a "leap of faith".

What is often missed is that Kierkegaard himself was an orthodox, Scandinavian Lutheran in conflict with the [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theological]] establishment of his day. His works built on one another and culminated with the orthodox [[Lutheran]] conception of a God that unconditionally accepts man, faith itself being a gift from God, and that the highest moral position is reached when a person realizes this and, no longer depending upon her or himself, takes the leap of faith into the arms of a loving God. In a Lutheran context, the leap of faith becomes much clearer.

{{Quotation|Suppose that [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]] himself has made the leap; suppose that with the aid of eloquence he manages to persuade a learner to want to do it. Then the learner has a direct relation to Jacobi and consequently does not himself come to make the leap. The direct relation between one human being and another is naturally much easier and gratifies one’s sympathies and one’s own need much more quickly and ostensibly more reliable. It is understood directly, and there is no need of that dialectic of the infinite to keep oneself infinitely resigned and infinitely enthusiastic in the sympathy of the infinite, whose secret is the renunciation of the fancy that in his God-relationship one human being is not the equal of another, which makes the presumed teacher a learner who attends to himself and makes all teaching a divine jest, because every human being is essentially taught solely by God. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Vol I Hong p. 610-611}}

Jacobi, Hegel, and C.S. Lewis wrote about Christianity in accordance with their understanding but Kierkegaard didn't want to do that. He felt that it was too dangerous to put in writing what was most holy to himself. He said, "Not even what I am writing here is my innermost meaning. I cannot entrust myself to paper in that way, even though I see it in what is written. Think what could happen! The paper could disappear; there could be a fire where I live and I could live in uncertainty about whether it was burned or still existed; I could die and thus leave it behind me; I could lose my mind and my innermost being could be in alien hands; I could go blind and not be able to find it myself, not know whether I stood with it in my hands without asking someone else, not know whether he lied, whether he was reading what was written there or something else in order to sound me out." Kierkegaard was of the opinion that faith is something different from other things: unexplainable and inexplicable. The more a person tries to explain personal faith to another, the more entangled that person becomes in language and [[semantics]] but "[[recollection]]"  is "''das Zugleich'', the all-at-once," that always brings him back to himself.&lt;ref&gt;(Stages on Life's Way, Hong p. 386)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The world has perhaps always had a lack of what could be called [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentic individualities]], decisive subjectivities, those artistically permeated with [[Human self-reflection|reflection]], the [[independent thinker]]s who differ from the bellowers and the didacticizers. The more objective the world and individual subjectivities become, the more difficult it becomes with the religious categories, which are precisely in the sphere of subjectivity. That is why it is almost an irreligious exaggeration to want to be world-historical, scholarly-scientific, and objective with regard to the religious. But I have not summoned Lessing in order to have someone to appeal to, because even wanting to be subjective enough to appeal to another subjectivity is already an attempt to become objective, is a first step toward getting the majority vote on one’s side and one’s God-relationship transformed into a speculative enterprise on the basis of probability and partnership and fellow shareholders is the first step toward becoming objective. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' p. 66}}

==The appropriation of faith==
Kierkegaard stuck to his concept of Christianity as an inner struggle where the single individual stands before God rather than before others. Because standing before God is where the decisive struggle occurs for each single individual. Each single individual who has an "interest" in becoming a Christian has a God-relationship which is different from any other individual. The more we look to "others" for our God-relationship, the more we have a simulated, mediated relationship with an idea. The idea, or [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]], isn't the [[Telos (philosophy)|highest]]. But getting the idea off the paper or the drawing board and putting it to use in life is the absolute for the Christian.  In [[Works of Love]] (1847) he wrote, "Love for the neighbor does not want to be sung about, it wants to be accomplished."&lt;ref&gt;Concluding Unscientific Postscript p.21, 105-106, 193-200, ''Works of Love'', Chapter II B You Shall Love the Neighbor.  P. 44ff&lt;/ref&gt; Christ didn't say one should think about loving the neighbor, he said, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Matthew 22.39) He put it this way in ''[[Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions]]'' (1845) in ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]'' (1846) in ''[[Sickness Unto Death]]'' (1849) and again in ''Works of Love'' (1847).  {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;Ah, it is much easier to look to the right and to the left than to look into oneself, much easier to haggle and bargain just as it is also much easier to underbid than to be silent-but the more difficult is still the one thing needful. Even in daily life everyone experiences that it is more difficult to stand directly before the person of distinction, directly before his royal majesty, than to move in the crowd; to stand alone and silent directly before the sharp expert is more difficult than to speak in a common harmony of equals-to say nothing of being alone directly before the Holy One and being silent. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'' p. 31&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Where is the boundary for the single individual in his concrete existence between what is lack of will and what is lack of ability; what is indolence and earthly selfishness and what is the limitation of finitude? For an existing person, when is the period of preparation over, when this question will not arise again in all its initial, troubled severity; when is the time in existence that is indeed a preparation? Let all the [[dialectic]]ians convene-they will not be able to decide this for a particular individual in ''concreto''. Søren Kierkegaard ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 490
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The lowest form of offense, humanly speaking the most innocent, is to leave the whole issue of Christ undecided, to pronounce in effect: 'I don't presume to judge the matter; I do not believe, but I pass no judgement." ..... The next form of offense is the negative, but passive form. Certainly it feels it cannot take no notice of Christ, leaving this business of Christ in abeyance and carrying on a busy life is something it is incapable of. But believing is something it cannot do either; so it stays staring at one and the same point, at the paradox. .... The final stage of offense is the positive form. It declares Christianity to be untruth and a lie. It denies Christ (that he has existed and that he is the one he claims to be) either [[Docetic]]ally or [[rationalism|rationalistically]], so that either Christ does not become a particular human being, but only appears to do so, or he becomes only a particular human being. Søren Kierkegaard ''The Sickness Unto Death'', Hannay p. 163-165&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;But when it is a duty to love, then no test is needed and no insulting foolhardiness of wanting to test, then love is higher than any test; it has already more than stood the test in the same sense as faith “more than conquers.” Testing is always related to possibility; it is always possible that what is being tested would not stand the test. Therefore, if someone wanted to test whether he has faith, or try to attain faith, this really means he will prevent himself from attaining faith; he will bring himself into the restlessness of craving where faith is never won, for “You shall believe.” ''Works of Love'', p. 33 &lt;/blockquote&gt;}}{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose that there were two men: a [[Double-mindedness|double-minded]] man, who believes he has gained faith in a loving Providence, because he had himself experienced having been helped, even though he had hardheartedly sent away a sufferer whom he could have helped; and another man whose life, by devoted love, was an instrument in the hand of [[Divine providence|Providence]], so that he helped many suffering ones, although the help he himself had wished continued to be denied him from year to year. Which of these two was in truth convinced that there is a loving Providence that cares for the suffering ones? Is it not a fair and a convincing conclusion: He that planted the ear, shall he not hear.(Psalms 94:9).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.cc/psalms/94-9.htm ''Psalm 94.9'' Bible]&lt;/ref&gt; But turn it around, and is the conclusion not equally fair and convincing: He whose life is sacrificing love shall he not trust that God is love? Yet in the press of busyness there is neither time nor quiet for the calm transparency which teaches equality, which teaches the willingness to pull in the same yoke with other men, that noble simplicity, that is in inner understanding with every man. There is neither time nor quiet to win such a conviction. Therefore, in the press of busyness even faith and hope and love and willing the Good become only loose words and double-mindedness. Or is it not double-mindedness to live without any conviction, or more rightly, to live in the constantly and continually changing fantasy that one has and that one has not a conviction!&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In this fashion feeling deceives the busy one into double-mindedness. Perhaps after the flaming up of the contrition of repentance, if this turns into emptiness, he had a conviction, at least so he believed, that there is a mercy that forgives sins. But even in the forgiveness he strongly denied any implication that he had been guilty of anything. Hence he had, so he thought, believed in a conviction that such a mercy exists, and yet in practice he denied its existence; in practice his attitude seemed designed to prove that it did not exist. Suppose that there were two men, that double-minded one, and then another man who would gladly forgive his debtor, if he himself might only find mercy. Which of these two was in truth convinced that such a mercy exists? The latter had indeed this proof that it exists, that he himself practices it, the former has no proof at all for himself, and only meets the contrary proof which he himself presents. Or the double-minded one perhaps had a feeling for right and wrong. It blazed strongly in him, especially if someone would describe in a poetical manner the zealous men, who by self-sacrifice in the service of truth, maintained righteousness and justice. Then some wrong happened to this man himself. And then it seemed to him as if there must appear some sign in heaven and upon earth since the world order could no more sleep than he until this wrong was put right again. And this was not [[self-love]] that inflamed him, but it was a feeling for [[justice]], so he thought. And when he obtained his [[rights]], no matter how much wrong it had cost those around him, then once again he praised the perfection of the world. Feeling had indeed carried him away, but also it had so enraptured him that he had forgotten the most important of all: to support righteousness and justice with self-sacrifice in the service of the truth. For which of these two is really convinced that justice exists in the world: the one that suffers wrong for doing the right, or the one that does wrong in order to obtain his right?  Søren Kierkegaard, (1846) ''Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing'', Steere p. 111-113&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

== Kierkegaard, Goethe, Marx, and Tolstoy ==
Kierkegaard questioned how a person changes. Some, like Hegel and Goethe, believed that an external event was required for a new epoch to begin. Kierkegaard disagreed because something might never happen in an external way that would cause a person to change and a possibility for a better life might be lost.  Marx followed after Hegel and Goethe but Tolstoy agreed more with Kierkegaard in his "view of life".&lt;ref&gt;''Either/Or'', Swenson, Preface&lt;/ref&gt;

Goethe may have been mocking the idea that the birth of Christ was what made him important or he may have seriously thought that his, Goethe's, own birth made him important.  Kierkegaard didn't believe that Christ had this "upside-downness that wanted to reap before it sowed or this kind of cowardliness that wanted to have certainty before it began."{{Sfn | Kierkgaard | 1993 | pp = 380–81}}  Goethe began his [[autobiography]] with the certainty that his life was going to have a great effect on the world stage.

Within the first twenty pages of his autobiography Goethe had pointed to the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] as another great life changing event in his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = von Goethe | first = Johann Wolfgang | author-link = Johann Wolfgang von Goethe | url = https://archive.org/stream/autogoethe00goetuoft#page/n31/mode/2up | type = autobiography | title = Truth and poetry, from my own life | year = 1848 | others = transl. [[John Oxenford]] | pages = 19–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Goethe's book was translated ''[[Truth]] and [[Poetry]]'' but was also translated ''Truth and [[Fiction]]''.  Both authors seemed to be against having a fictional existence. Goethe believed the existence of Christ was being fictionalized while Kierkegaard believed the existence Goethe wrote about in his own autobiography was fictional – and much of it was.
{{Quotation |On the 28th of August, 1749, at mid-day, as the clock struck twelve, I came into the world, at [[Frankfort-on-the-Maine]]. My horoscope was propitious: the sun stood in the sign of the Virgin, and had culminated for the day; Jupiter and Venus looked on him with a friendly eye, and Mercury not adversely; while Saturn and Mars kept themselves indifferent; the Moon alone, just full, exerted the power of her reflection all the more, as he had then reached her planetary hour. She opposed herself, therefore, to my birth, which could not be accomplished until this hour was passed. These good aspects, which the astrologers managed subsequently to reckon very auspicious for me, may have been the causes of my preservation; for, through the unskillfulness [sic] of the midwife, I came into the world as dead, and only after various efforts was I enabled to see the light. This event, which had put our household into straights, turned to the advantage of my fellow-citizens, inasmuch as my grandfather, the ''[[Schultheiß|Schultheiss]]'' (judge), John Wolfgang Textor, took occasion from it to have an ''accoucheur'' established, and to introduce or revive the tuition of midwives, which may have done some good to those who were born after me.{{Sfn | Goethe | 1848}}{{Page needed |date=January 2016}}}}

Count [[Leo Tolstoy]] said he found out "there was no God" in 1838 when he was 12 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, [https://archive.org/stream/completeworks09tols#page/n15/mode/2up  My Confession], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He had to work through this idea for the next 38 years until he could come away with a method by which he could believe, not only in God but in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, [[s:What I Believe (Tolstoy)|Wikisource, What I Believe.]] [http://librivox.org/what-i-believe-by-leo-tolstoy/ What I Believe.] Librivox.org&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard heard the same from Hegelian philosophers and worked through his doubt to belief but he opposed that method. His thought was to start with faith and proceed forward making positive steps rather than always falling back to start over after doubt had prevailed. He said, "False doubt doubts everything except itself; with the help of faith, the doubt that saves doubts only itself."&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Philosophical Fragments'', 1844, Swenson p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard didn't want to argue about his faith any more than he wanted to argue about why he may or may not get married or become a professor. He just wanted to make the movement from "possibility to actuality"&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Vol 1, p. 314-315 Hong translation&lt;/ref&gt; and knew that he would just be wasting time if he tried to explain himself.&lt;blockquote&gt;I think that, just as a Christian always ought to be able to explain his faith, so also a married man ought to be able to explain his marriage, not simply to anyone who deigns to ask, but to anyone he thinks worthy of it, or even if, as in this case, unworthy, he finds it propitious to do so. ''Either/Or Part II'', p. 88-89, Hong&lt;/blockquote&gt;Tolstoy tried to explain the method he used to come to grips with the Christian religion. He acted on his beliefs by freeing his [[serfs]], writing books to help them learn to read and giving them land to farm and live on. He didn't argue and reason with his neighbors; he just did what he set out to do.

[[File:Soeren kierkegaard 5627.jpg|Thumb|300px||right|Søren Kierkegaard]][[Karl Marx]] complained about [[Hegelian]] philosophers in [[Theses on Feuerbach]] in this way, "The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways: the point, however, is to change it." [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] changed the quote to reflect the Kierkegaardian difference in his 1959 book, ''From Shakespeare to Existentialism'': &lt;blockquote&gt;His [Kierkegaard's] relation to philosophy is best expressed by changing one small word in Marx's famous dictum: "The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways: the point, however, is to change"-not "it," as Marx said, but ourselves." p. 202  &lt;/blockquote&gt; Only in changing oneself is one equal with another, according to Kierkegaard because, in Christianity, all are equal before God. The world is too abstract to change; but the single individual, you yourself: that is something concrete.&lt;ref&gt;See Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' (1843-1844), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard put it this way in his ''Upbuilding Discourses'' of 1843-1844 and in his ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' of 1847: {{Quote | The idea so frequently stressed in Holy Scripture for the purpose of elevating the lowly and humbling the mighty, the idea that God does not respect the status of persons, this idea the apostle wants to bring to life in the single individual for application in his life. [...] In the hallowed places, in every upbuilding view of life, the thought arises in a person’s soul that help him to fight the good fight with flesh and blood, with principalities and powers, and in the fight to free himself for equality before God, whether this battle is more a war of aggression against the differences that want to encumber him with worldly favoritism or a defensive war against the differences that want to make him anxious in worldly perdition. Only in this way is equality the divine law, only in this way is the struggle the truth, only in this way does the victory have validity- only when the single individual fights for himself with himself within himself and does not unseasonably presume to help the whole world to obtain external equality, which is of very little benefit, all the less so because it never existed, if for no other reason than that everyone would come to thank him and become unequal before him, only in this way is equality the divine law.{{Sfn
| Kierkegaard | 1993 | pp. 141–43}}}}
{{Quote | Are you now living in such a way that you are aware as a single individual, that in every relationship in which you relate yourself outwardly you are aware that you are also relating yourself to yourself as a single individual, that even in the relationship we human beings so beautifully call the most intimate (marriage) you recollect that you have an even more intimate relationship, the relationship in which you as a single individual relate yourself to yourself before God?{{Sfn | Kierkegaard | 1993 | p = 129}}}}

The idea behind world history and constant quantification dehumanizes the quality known as the single individual and can produce "soul rot due to the monotony of self-concern and self-preoccupation" with anxiety about where you fit within the system. Language comes to the aid with copious quantities of words to explain everything. But Kierkegaard says: "the pathos of the ethical is to act."{{Sfn | Kierkgaard | 1993 | pp = 206–7, 389–90, 14–16, 24–25}}
{{Quotation |The observer stares numbly into the immense forest of the generations, and like someone who cannot see the forest for the trees, he sees only the forest, not a single tree. He hangs up curtains systematically and uses people and nations for that purpose - individual human beings are nothing to him; even eternity itself is draped with systematic surveys and ethical meaninglessness. Poetry squanders poetically, but, far from fasting itself, it does not dare to presuppose the divine frugality of the infinite that ethically-psychologically does not need many human beings but needs the idea all the more. No wonder, then, that one even admires the observer when he is noble, heroic, or perhaps more correctly, absentminded enough to forget that he, too, is a human being, an existing individual human being! By steadily staring into that world-historical drama, he dies and departs; nothing of him remains, or he himself remains like a ticket the usher holds in his hands as a sign that now the spectator has gone. If, however, becoming subjective is the highest task assigned to a human being, then everything turns out beautifully. From this it first follows that he no longer has anything to do with world history but in that respect leaves everything to the royal poet.  Second, there is not squandering, for even though individuals are as innumerable as the sands of the sea, the task of becoming subjective is indeed assigned to every person.  Finally, this does not deny the reality of the world-historical development, which, reserved for God and eternity, has both its time and its place.{{Sfn | Kierkgaard | 1993 | p = 159}}}}
{{Quotation|As a rule repentance is identified by one thing, that it acts. In our day, it perhaps is less subject to being misunderstood in this way.

==You are the one==
The difference between Kierkegaard and Marx is that one applied everything to himself while the other applied everything to someone else or to the whole world. Appropriating information or a [[life-view]] is difficult and it's more difficult the less one relies on the opinions of others. Abraham just heard God's promises and they were unreasonable but he had faith. This idea that the world has to be reasonable or respond to human reason is one that omits the world of the spirit. The world is abstract, the church is abstract, the world of the spirit is abstract but the single individual is concrete if one wills to be that. And the single individual relates himself or herself to the world, the church, the world of the spirit, the environment, the established order, the educational facilities in a unique way according to Kierkegaard. The leap means to stop relating yourself to a crowd or a race and then to the world, the church, the world of the spirit, the environment, etc. Once the individual chooses to do that, the leap is made, resolutions become possibilities and one's personality can be developed in freedom.{{Sfn | Kierkegaard | 1993 | p = 310 | ps =. He didn't want to just have a presupposition that God exists but he wanted to act with that presupposition in mind. He writes about his presupposition, his wish, his intelligence (sagacity).}}

[[File:NathanandDavid.JPG|Thumb|left|300px|David and Nathan]]Kierkegaard started out, in ''Either/Or'' Part 1, by saying, "“You know how the prophet Nathan dealt with King David when he presumed to understand the parable the prophet had told him but was unwilling to understand that it applied to him. Then to make sure, Nathan added: You are the man, O King. In the same way I also have continually tried to remind you that you are the one who is being discussed and you are the one who is spoken to.”&lt;ref&gt;Either/Or Part I, p. 5 Swenson [http://bible.cc/2_samuel/12-7.htm 2 Samuel 12.7]&lt;/ref&gt; He discussed this again in another way in ''Either/Or Part II'' where he begins: "The esthetic view also considers the [[Personality development|personality]] in relation to the surrounding world, and the expression for this is in its recurrence in the personality of enjoyment. But the esthetic expression for enjoyment in its relation to the personality is mood. That is, the personality is present in the mood, but it is dimly present. ... The [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] of the person who lives [[ethics|ethically]] is centralized. He is not in the mood, and he is not mood, but he has mood and has the mood within himself. What he works for is continuity, and this is always the master of mood. His life does not lack mood-indeed, it has a total mood. But this is acquired; it is what would be called ''aequale tempermentum'' [even [[disposition]]]. But this is no esthetic mood, and no person has it by nature or immediately."&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Either/Or'' 1843 II p. 229-230 Hong&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1845, he repeated the same point in ''Stages on Life's Way'' with a story about an individual with an [[addiction]] to gambling and another individual who was a gambler but wasn't in [[despair]] because of it: {{Quotation|A [[gambler]] comes to a standstill, repentance seizes him, he renounces all gambling. Although he has been standing on the brink of the abyss, repentance nevertheless hangs on to him, and it seems to be successful. Living withdrawn as he does now, possibly saved, he one day sees the body of a man drawn out on the [[Seine]]: a suicide, and this was a gambler just as he himself had been, and he knew that this gambler had struggled, had fought a desperate battle to resist his craving. My gambler had loved this man, not because he was a gambler, but because he was better than he was. What then? It is unnecessary to consult romances and novels, but even a religious speaker would very likely break off my story a little earlier and have it end with my gambler, shocked by the sight, going home and thanking God for his rescue. Stop. First of all we should have a little explanation, a judgment pronounced on the other gambler; every life that is not thoughtless ''eo ipso'' indirectly passes judgment. If the other gambler had been callous, then he could certainly conclude: He did not want to be saved. But this was not the case. No, my gambler is a man who has understood the old saying ''de te narratur fabula'' [ the tale is told to you]; he is no modern fool who believes that everyone should court the colossal task of being able to rattle off something that applies to the whole human race but not to himself. So what [[judgment]] shall he pass, and he cannot keep from doing it, for this ''de te'' is for him the most sacred law of life, because, it is the covenant of humanity.  Søren Kierkegaard ''Stages on Life's Way'' p. 477-478 Hong}} {{Quotation|The visible Church has suffered so broad an expansion that all the original relationships have been reversed. Just as it once required energy and determination to become a Christian, so now, though the renunciation be not praiseworthy, it requires courage and energy to renounce the Christian religion, while it needs only thoughtlessness to remain a nominal Christian. The baptism of children may nevertheless be defensible; no new custom needs to be introduced. But since the circumstances are so radically changed, the clergy should themselves be able to perceive that if it was once their duty, when only a very few were Christians, to win men for Christianity, their present task must rather be to win men by deterring them-for their misfortune is that they are already Christians of a sort. Everyone knows that the most difficult leap, even in the physical realm, is when a man leaps into the air from a standing position and comes down again on the same spot. The leap becomes easier in the degree to which some distance intervenes between the initial position and the place where the leap takes off. And so it is also with respect to a decisive movement in the realm of the spirit. The most difficult decisive action is not that in which the individual is far removed from the decision (as when a non-Christian is about to decide to become one), but when it is as if the matter were already decided. What is baptism without personal appropriation? It is an expression for the possibility that the baptized child may become a Christian, neither more nor less.

Throughout his writings Kierkegaard reiterated his emphasis on the single individual learning how to make a resolution. One example is the following prayer from his April 26, 1848 book ''[[Christian Discourses]]''.

{{Quotation|Father in heaven, Thy grace and mercy change not with the changing times, they grow not older with the course of years, as if, like a man, Thou wert more gracious one day than another, more gracious at first than at the last; Thy grace remains unchanged as Thou are unchangeable, it is ever the same, eternally young, new every day-for every day Thou sayest, ‘yet today’ ([http://www.biblestudytools.com/hebrews/3.html Hebrews 3:13]). Oh, but when one givest heed to this word, is impressed by it, and with a serious, holy resolution says to himself, ‘yet today’-then for him this means that this very day he desires to be changed, desires that this very day might become important to him above all other days, important because of renewed confirmation in the good he once chose, or perhaps even because of his first choosing of the good. It is an expression of Thy grace and mercy that every day Thou dost say, ‘yet today’, but it would be to forfeit Thy grace and mercy and the season of grace if a man were to say unchangeably from day to day, ‘yet today’; for it is Thou that bestowest the season of grace ‘yet today’, but it is man that must grasp the season of grace ‘yet today’. Thus it is we talk with Thee, O God; between us there is a difference of language, and yet we strive to make ourselves understood of Thee, and Thou doest not blush to be called our God. That word which when Thou, O God, dost utter it is the eternal expression of Thy unchangeable grace, that same word when a man repeats it with due understanding is the strongest expression of the deepest change and decision-yea, as if all were lost if this change and decision did not come to pass ‘yet today’. So do Thou grant to them that today are here assembled, to them that without external prompting, and hence the more inwardly, have resolved ‘yet today’ to seek reconciliation with Thee by the confession of their sins, to them do Thou grant that this day may be truly blessed to them, that they may hear His voice whom Thou didst send to the world, the voice of the Good Shepherd, that He may know them, and that they may follow Him.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Since [[Lévy flight]]s and walks can optimize search efficiencies, therefore natural selection should have led to adaptations for Lévy flight foraging.''&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==
The movement of animals closely resembles in many ways the [[Brownian motion|random walks of dust particles in a fluid]].&lt;ref name=buchanan&gt;{{cite journal | last=Buchanan | first=Mark | title=Ecological modelling: The mathematical mirror to animal nature | journal=Nature | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=453 | issue=7196 | date=5 June 2008 | issn=0028-0836 | doi=10.1038/453714a | pages=714–716 | pmid=18528368}}&lt;/ref&gt; This similarity led to interest in trying to understand how animals move via the analogy to Brownian motion. This conventional wisdom held until the early 1990s.  However, starting in the late 1980s, evidence began to accumulate that did not fit the theoretical predictions.&lt;ref name=buchanan/&gt;

In 1999, a theoretical investigation of the properties of [[Lévy flight]]s showed that an inverse square distribution of flight times or distances could optimize the search efficiency under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Viswanathan | first=G. M. | last2=Buldyrev | first2=Sergey V. | last3=Havlin | first3=Shlomo | last4=da Luz | first4=M. G. E. | last5=Raposo | first5=E. P. | last6=Stanley | first6=H.

The team of researchers, consisting of Gandhimohan M. Viswanathan, Sergey V. Buldyrev, Marcos Gomes E. da Luz, Shlomo Havlin, Ernesto P. Raposo and H. Eugene Stanley, published these results in 1999 in the journal ''Nature''.

There has been some controversy about the reality of Lévy flight foraging. Early studies were limited to a small range of movement, and thus the type of motion could not be unequivocally determined; and in 2007 flaws were found in a study of wandering albatrosses which was the first empirical example of such a strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Edwards | first=Andrew M. | last2=Phillips | first2=Richard A. | last3=Watkins | first3=Nicholas W. | last4=Freeman | first4=Mervyn P. | last5=Murphy | first5=Eugene J. | last6=Afanasyev | first6=Vsevolod | last7=Buldyrev | first7=Sergey V. | last8=da Luz | first8=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2844">The '''Mansion of Many Apartments''' is a metaphor that the [[poetry|poet]] [[John Keats]] expressed in a letter to [[John Hamilton Reynolds]] dated Sunday, 3 May 1818.&lt;blockquote&gt;

: I compare human life to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, the doors of the rest being as yet shut upon me - The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think - We remain there a long while, and notwithstanding the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by awakening of the thinking principle - within us - we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one's vision into the nature and heart of Man — of convincing one's nerves that the World is full of misery and Heartbreak, Pain, sickness and oppression — whereby This Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken'd and at the same time on all sides of it many doors are set open - but all dark - all leading to dark passages — We see not the balance of good and evil. We are in a Mist - We are now in that state — We feel the burden of the Mystery.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:F3KC-Gtbg_EJ:englishhistory.net/keats/letters/reynolds3May1818.html+keats+%22mansion+of+many+apartments%22&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk&amp;client=firefox-a John Keats, letter To J H Reynolds, 3 May 1818. see]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colvin, Sidney''John Keats: His Life and Poetry, His Friends, Critics and After-Fame'', Admant Media Corp 2006, p267   {{ISBN|1-113-43548-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here Keats suggests that people were capable of different levels of thought. Those who did not consider the [[world]] around them remained in the thoughtless chamber. Even though the door to move on to the next "[[apartment]]" was open, they had no desire to think any deeper and to go into that next apartment.

When you did move on into the next chamber, you would for the first time have a [[choice]] of direction, as from this apartment there were several different dark passages. Keats believed that he was at this point when he wrote the letter, as was [[William Wordsworth]] when he wrote ''[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Tintern Abbey]]''.

Keats expressed this idea in [[The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream]] (1819).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3923">The '''marginal revenue productivity theory of wages''' is a theory in [[neoclassical economics]] stating that [[wage]]s are paid at a level equal to the '''marginal revenue product''' of [[Labour (economics)|labor]], MRP (the value of the [[marginal product]] of labor), which is the increment to revenues caused by the increment to output produced by the last laborer employed.  In a model, this is justified by an assumption that the firm is profit-maximizing and thus would employ labor only up to the point that marginal labor costs equal the marginal revenue generated for the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel S. Hamermesh. 1986. The demand for labor in the long run. ''Handbook of Labor Economics'' (Orley Ashenfelter and Richard Layard, ed.) p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The marginal revenue product (MRP) of a worker is equal to the product of the marginal product of labour (MP) (the increment to output from an increment to labor used) and the marginal revenue (MR) (the increment to sales revenue from an increment to output): MRP = MP × MR. The theory states that workers will be hired up to the point when the marginal revenue product is equal to the wage rate. If the marginal revenue brought by the worker is less than the wage rate, then employing that laborer would cause a decrease in profit.

The idea that payments to factors of production equal their marginal productivity had been laid out by [[John Bates Clark]] and [[Knut Wicksell]], in simpler models. Much of the MRP theory stems from Wicksell's model.

==Mathematical relation==

The marginal revenue product of labour MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the increase in revenue per unit increase in the variable input =  ∆TR/∆L 

:MR = ∆TR/∆Q

:MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆Q/∆L

:MR x MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = (∆TR/∆Q) x (∆Q/∆L) = ∆TR/∆L

The change in output is not limited to that directly attributable to the additional worker. Assuming that the firm is operating with diminishing marginal returns then the addition of an extra worker reduces the average productivity of every other worker (and every other worker affects the marginal productivity of the additional worker).

As above noted the firm will continue to add units of labor until the MRP equals the wage rate ''w''&amp;mdash;mathematically until

:MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''

:MR(MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''w''

:MR = w/MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;

:MR = MC which is the profit maximizing rule.

==Marginal revenue product in a perfectly competitive market==

Under [[perfect competition]], marginal revenue product is equal to marginal physical product (extra unit produced as a result of a new employment) multiplied by price.

:&lt;math&gt;MRP = MPP \times \text{MR(=AR=D) as perfectly competitive labour market}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MRP = MPP \times \text{Price}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:
This is because the firm in [[perfect competition]] is a [[price taker]]. It does not have to lower the price in order to sell additional units of the good.

==MRP in monopoly or imperfect competition==

Firms operating as monopolies or in imperfect competition face downward-sloping [[demand curve]]s. To sell extra units of output, they would have to lower their output's price. Under such market conditions, marginal revenue product will not equal MPP×Price. This is because the firm is not able to sell output at a fixed price per unit. Thus the MRP curve of a firm in [[monopoly]] or in [[imperfect competition]] will slope downwards, when plotted against labor usage, at a faster rate than in perfect specific competition.

== Biography ==
Anwander was born in [[Bregenz]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She studied Theater, Film, and Media Science at the [[University of Vienna]], graduating in 2003.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She earned a degree from the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]] in Vienna in 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2013, Anwander stated that "my work mainly questions authenticity of artworks and the gap between the [[Art market|art-market]] and the artist as participator."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leoalmanac.org/vol19-no2-interview-statement-artwork-by-maria-anwander/|title=Leonardo Electronic Almanac – Interview, Statement, Artwork by Maria Anwander|website=www.leoalmanac.org|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She adds that "my latest works deal with issues of [[collecting]], [[ownership]] and [[authorship]]. Hereby I'm highly interested in the creation of notional images by removing other already existing images. The [[Dematerialization (art)|dematerialization]] and [[deconstruction]] of images into pure descriptions of themselves and vice versa is part of my deliberations."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Anwander currently lives and works in [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Works ==

=== ''My Most Favorite Art (2004–2011)'' ===
Anwander created an [[Installation art|installation]] of the exhibition labels she had stolen from art galleries and museums.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maria-anwander.net/work.php?id=16|title=maria anwander|website=www.maria-anwander.net|access-date=2016-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation is also intended as a travel diary and Anwander states that its purpose is to give the viewer "access to my innermost, to the works accompanying my artistic career."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== ''The World's Leading Art Magazine (2009–2013)'' ===
Anwander used tissues to remove the ink from the pages of an [[List of art magazines|art magazine]] which purported to be the world's leading art magazine, leaving only the blank magazine and the ink from the pages on the tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maria-anwander.net/work.php?id=24|title=maria anwander|website=www.maria-anwander.net|access-date=2016-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Analyzing (2010)'' ===
Anwander filmed a 32-minute video where she met with Adolfo Profumo, a [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], in [[New York City]] who attempts to tell her about her personality through looking through her portfolio.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== ''The Kiss (2010)'' ===
In 2010, Anwander entered the [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] as a regular visitor and, unauthorized, French-kissed a wall she had chosen.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.casino-luxembourg.lu/en/Artist-residencies/Been-Present|title=Casino Luxembourg ⋅ Artist residencies ⋅ Been Present|website=www.casino-luxembourg.lu|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wetheurban.com/post/72706219639/art-the-kiss-by-maria-anwander-the-kiss-was|title=WETHEURBAN|website=WETHEURBAN|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twoseriousladies.org/an-ongoing-conversation-with-maria-anwander-part-one/|title=An Ongoing Conversation with Maria Anwander, Part One {{!}} Two Serious Ladies|website=www.twoseriousladies.org|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then affixed a label identical to the labels used by [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]], explaining her rationale and explaining that she "uses art institutions as forums where hierarchical, social and economic models can be tested and reimagined. This piece is a part of a series of artworks and performances, which Anwander has developed since 2004, playing with the link between art institutions and market."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== ''Public Dancefloor (2012)'' ===
Anwander staged an intervention in a public space where a public dance floor was installed in the middle of a [[Urban park|public park]] in [[Innsbruck|Innsbruck, Austria]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.curators-network.eu/archiveuploads/items/867.pdf|title=Curators' Network|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A light switch, disco ball, loudspeaker, and lights were installed. When the light switch was pressed, lights turned on and music began to play for the duration of one song.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== ''The Present (2012)'' ===
In 2012, Anwander staged an intervention and placed a block of limestone weighing two tons in the city centre of [[Luxembourg]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.twoseriousladies.org/an-ongoing-conversation-with-maria-anwander-part-2/|title=An Ongoing Conversation with Maria Anwander, Part 2 {{!}} Two Serious Ladies|website=www.twoseriousladies.org|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Untitled (2012), in collaboration with Ruben Aubrecht'' ===
Anwander and Aubrecht created a 100 x 280&amp;nbsp;cm [[sculpture]] which read, "JUST ANOTHER WORK OF ART WHICH WILL NOT GO DOWN IN HISTORY."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== ''Untitled (2012), in collaboration with Ruben Aubrecht'' ===
In collaboration with Aubrecht, Anwander placed embroidered pillows with statistics about [[poverty]], [[malnutrition]] or [[Distribution of wealth|wealth distribution]] on couches in luxury apartments, hotel lobbies and exclusive restaurants in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The work was intended to be a response to the "increasing development of parallel societies."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

For off-the-field marketing activities, Suh signed with The Agency Sports Management &amp; Marketing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://theagencysports.com The Agency Sports Management &amp; Marketing]. Theagencysports.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-25.&lt;/ref&gt; where Russ Spielman served as lead agent.

Before the NFL draft, Suh signed with Maximum Sports Management and agent Roosevelt Barnes. This caused moderate concern for many teams who were hoping to draft him, as this was the same agent who represented [[Michael Crabtree]]. Crabtree was the longest [[2009 NFL Draft]] first round contract hold out, waiting over six weeks into the NFL season before signing with the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. Crabtree had even threatened to re-enter the [[2010 NFL Draft]].

Despite the concerns, Suh was selected second overall in the [[2010 NFL Draft]] by the Detroit Lions, becoming the first defensive lineman selected by the team in the first round since [[Luther Elliss]] in [[1995 NFL Draft|1995]]. Suh was the highest selected Cornhusker defender since [[Neil Smith (American football)|Neil Smith]] in [[1988 NFL Draft|1988]].

====2011 season====
[[File:Ndamukong Suh NFL.JPG|thumb|Suh in 2011.]]

During the third quarter of the Lions' [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving game]] against the [[Green Bay Packers]] on November 24, 2011, Suh pushed Packers' offensive lineman [[Evan Dietrich-Smith]]'s head into the ground three times, then stomped on his arm.  All of this took place after the whistle was blown. Suh was penalized for unnecessary roughness and ejected from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/48903/case-closed-on-ndamukong-suh|title=Case closed on Ndamukong Suh|author=Kevin Seifert|date=November 24, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-24|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting penalty gave the Packers an automatic first down. The Packers would score a touchdown two plays later, giving them a 14–0 lead and an eventual 27–15 victory.

Initially, Suh denied stomping on Dietrich-Smith, saying he was only trying to get his balance back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/34877/verbatim-ndamukong-suh|title=Verbatim: Ndamukong Suh|author=Kevin Seifert|date=November 24, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-26|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, on Friday morning, the Lions issued a statement calling Suh's actions "unacceptable".  Within hours, Suh wrote on his Facebook page that he'd "made a mistake" a day before and intended to learn from it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7278879/ndamukong-suh-detroit-lions-apologizes-stomp-says-learned-situation Ndamukong Suh apologizes for stomp]. [[ESPN]], 2011-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]] NFL [[rules analyst]] and former vice president of officiating [[Mike Pereira]] said that based on his knowledge of league discipline, "the question won’t be if the NFL will suspend Suh, but when—and for how many games".  He drew parallels between Suh's actions and those of [[Albert Haynesworth]], who drew a five-game suspension—the longest suspension for an on-field incident in modern NFL history—for stomping on [[Andre Gurode]]'s head in 2006.&lt;ref name=Pereira/&gt;

On November 29, the NFL suspended Suh for two games without pay which was $165,294 in lost wages.&lt;ref name="fine_list_2014" /&gt; In announcing the decision, [[Roger Goodell]] noted that it was the fifth time Suh had been disciplined for on-field conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/Ndamukong-Suh-Detroit-Lions-NFL-suspension-two-games-for-stomping-incident-112911|title=Lions' Suh appealing 2-game suspension|author=Jay Glazer|authorlink=Jay Glazer|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-29|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suh appealed the decision, and the NFL held an expedited hearing before former [[Oakland Raiders]] coach [[Art Shell]], so that a decision could be handed down before the Lions' next game, on December 4, against the [[New Orleans Saints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7293935/ndamukong-suh-detroit-lions-suspended-two-games-pay|title=Source: Ndamukong Suh appeals ban|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-29|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The appeal was turned down on December 2, forcing Suh to sit out the game against the Saints and the December 11 game against the [[Minnesota Vikings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7307624/detroit-lions-ndamukong-suh-appeal-denied-miss-two-games Ndamukong Suh's appeal denied].

http://www.detroitlions.com/news/lions-insider/article-1/Stafford-Suh-and-Delmas-named-Pro-Bowl-alternates/76971202-e7e6-41e4-9545-75656672329f|work=detroitlions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the 2011 season with 4 sacks, a pass defended, and 26 tackles.

====2012 season====
During a Thanksgiving game on November 22, 2012, Suh was involved in a play in which he kicked [[Houston Texans]] quarterback [[Matt Schaub]] in the groin. The incident resulted in a $30,000 fine from the league, nearly double the mandated fine for a second offense of "striking/kicking/kneeing" an opponent.&lt;ref name=McIntyre&gt;{{cite web|last=McIntyre|first=Brian|title=NFL fines Ndamukong Suh $30,000 for kick to Matt Schaub’s groin|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/nfl-fines-ndamukong-suh-30-000-kick-matt-213759804--nfl.html|date=November 28, 2012|work=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=December 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was speculation the size of the fine was recognition by the league of Suh's history of questionable on-field hits, while others viewed it as a "wishy-washy" and "cop-out" action by the league in issuing a large fine without a suspension.&lt;ref name=McIntyre/&gt;&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web|title=Ndamukong Suh fined $30K in wishy-washy decision by NFL|url=http://nfl.si.com/2012/11/28/ndamukong-suh-fined-30k-in-wishy-washy-decision-by-nfl/|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=December 30, 2012|date=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] said that "intent is something that’s very difficult for us to ever try to make a judgment on".&lt;ref name="SI" /&gt; Suh denied the kick was intentional, stating his foot inadvertently hit Schaub as he was being dragged to the ground.&lt;ref name="SI" /&gt; Suh finished 2012 with 8 sacks, 2 passes defended, and 25 tackles in 16 games (15 starts).

====2013 season====
In the Lions' Week 1 victory over the [[Minnesota Vikings]], 34–24, Suh low blocked [[John Sullivan (American football)|John Sullivan]] during a [[DeAndre Levy]] "[[Interception returned for touchdown|pick 6]]"; the resulting [[Personal foul (football)|personal foul]] nullified Levy's touchdown. Two days after the game, Suh was fined $100,000 for the hit—which, not counting lost pay for suspensions, is the largest fine ever issued to a player for on-the-field actions. He appealed the fine but the ruling was later upheld by the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ndamukong Suh loses appeal of $100,000 fine|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/12/ndamukong-suh-loses-appeal-of-100000-fine/|work=NBC|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Lions' Week 6 victory over the [[Cleveland Browns]], Suh tackled Browns QB [[Brandon Weeden]] in a questionable manner. Though not called for a penalty during the game, Suh was fined $31,500 by the NFL, but fine was later rescinded.&lt;ref name="fine_rescinded"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/blog/detroit-lions/post/_/id/14299/detroit-lions-catch-massive-break-with-reinstatement-of-ndamukong-suh | title=Detroit Lions catch massive break with Ndamukong Suh's appeal win | accessdate=October 30, 2015 | date=December 30, 2014 | publisher=ESPN | first=Michael | last=Rothstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a Thanksgiving game against the Packers on November 28, 2013, Suh sacked [[Matt Flynn]] in the end zone, forcing a safety for the first time of his career. On November 29, 2013, Suh was fined $7,875 for performing a throat slash gesture during a game against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].

====2014 season====
Suh racked up 53 tackles and 8.5 sacks in the 2014 season. In Week 17, against the [[Green Bay Packers]], Suh stepped on quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]]' calf. Suh received a one-game suspension, seemingly barring him from the Wild Card playoff game the following week against the [[Dallas Cowboys]]; but on appeal, arbitrator [[Ted Cottrell]] reversed the suspension, opting instead for another fine worth $70,000. Suh played in the Wild Card matchup against the Cowboys and sacked [[Tony Romo]] twice.

=== Miami Dolphins ===
====2015 season====
On March 11, 2015, the [[Miami Dolphins]] announced that they had signed Suh to a six-year, $114 million contract with $60 million guaranteed. The contract made him the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history, passing [[Houston Texans]] defensive end [[J. J. Watt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000477761/article/ndamukong-suh-miami-dolphins-strike-mega-deal |title=Ndamukong Suh, Miami Dolphins strike mega deal |work=[[National Football League]] |first=Kevin |last=Patra |date=March 11, 2015 |accessdate=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2015/03/11/ndamukong-suh-miami-dolphins-contract/70149468/ Suh signs with Dolphins, cites money as the reason] ''Detroit Free Press'', March 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=James|title=Ndamukong Suh signs record deal|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12462569/miami-dolphins-make-ndamukong-suh-top-paid-nfl-defensive-player|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a game against the Washington Redskins on September 13, 2015, as Redskins' running back [[Alfred Morris (American football)|Alfred Morris]] was still lying on the ground following a tackle, Suh appeared to knock Morris's helmet off with his leg. The next day, the NFL announced that they would not discipline him, as "Suh's action was not deemed a kick".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patra|first1=Kevin|title=Ndamukong Suh won't be punished for Morris incident|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000530418/article/ndamukong-suh-wont-be-punished-for-morris-incident|website=NFL.com|publisher=NFL|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suh started all 16 games in 2015, finishing the season with 61 tackles, six sacks, and five passes defended. He was ranked 40th on the [[NFL Top 100 Players of 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-top100-2016/0ap3000000669661/Top-100-Players-of-2016-No-40-Ndamukong-Suh NFL Top 100 Players of 2016 - No. 40 Ndamukong Suh]&lt;/ref&gt;

====2016 season====
In 2016, Suh started all 16 games with 72 tackles, 5 sacks, and 6 passes defended. He was ranked 55th by his peers on the [[NFL Top 100 Players of 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-top100-2017/0ap3000000810430/Top-100-Players-of-2017-No-55-Ndamukong-Suh NFL Top 100 Players of 2017 - No. 55 Ndamukong Suh]&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017 season====
During [[Thursday Night Football]] against the [[Baltimore Ravens]] in Week 8, Suh committed two unnecessary roughness penalties, including one moment where he attempted to choke [[Ryan Mallett]] and shove him out of reach. Suh claimed that his choke on Mallett was a self-defense, thinking that Mallett tried to attack him firsthand. The Dolphins were shut out as they lost 40-0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch: Dolphins' Ndamukong Suh Grabs Ravens Ryan Mallett's Throat|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2017/10/26/ndamukong-suh-grabs-ryan-mallett-throat|publisher=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nardone|first1=Joseph|title=Dolphins ready to release defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh|url=https://clutchpoints.com/dolphins-ready-release-defensive-lineman-ndamukong-suh/|publisher=Clutch Sports|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 14, 2018, Suh was released, to free up a large amount of salary cap, after serving three seasons with the Dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miami Dolphins release Ndamukong Suh, Julius Thomas|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000921289/article/miami-dolphins-cut-ndamukong-suh-julius-thomas|publisher=NFL|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Los Angeles Rams ===
On March 26, 2018, Suh signed a one-year, $14 million contract with the [[Los Angeles Rams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bergman|first1=Jeremy|title=Rams signing DT Ndamukong Suh to 1-year, $14M deal|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000923212/article/rams-signing-dt-ndamukong-suh-to-1year-14m-deal|website=NFL.com|date=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style of play===
Suh has been criticized in the media by other players and by the NFL for his aggressive style of play and has been fined a total of $216,875 by the league for four violations in the first four years in his career. In a poll of fellow players conducted by the ''[[Sporting News]]'', Suh was named "the dirtiest player" in the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxsportsdetroit.com/11/08/11/Suh-voted-dirtiest-player-by-his-peers/landing_lions.html?blockID=599388&amp;feedID=3862 Suh voted 'dirtiest player' by his peers].

==Personal life==
In 2015, [[Forbes]] estimated Suh's annual income at $38.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Forbes Profile |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/ndamukong-suh/ |year=2015 |accessdate=April 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donation and endowment===
On April 17, 2010, at the annual Husker Spring Game, Suh announced a $2.6 million donation to the University of Nebraska. Two million dollars of his gift will go to Nebraska Athletics for its Strength and Conditioning Program, and the remaining $600,000 will create an endowed scholarship for the UNL College of Engineering, from which he graduated in 2009 with a degree in [[construction management]].&lt;ref name="SuhDonation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&amp;ATCLID=204930543|work=huskers.com |title=Ndamukong Suh to Donate $2.6 Million to the University of Nebraska |date=April 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His gift is the largest single charitable contribution by any former player and occurred before Suh was taken with the second overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft.

'''Neglect''' is a form of [[abuse]] where the perpetrator, who is responsible for caring for someone who is unable to care for themselves, fails to do so. It can be a result of carelessness, indifference, or unwillingness. 

Neglect may include the failure to provide sufficient supervision, nourishment, or medical care, or the failure to fulfill other needs for which the victim cannot provide themselves. The term is also applied when necessary care is withheld by those responsible for providing it from animals, plants, and even inanimate objects. Neglect can carry on in a child's life falling into many long-term side effects such as: physical injuries, low [[self-esteem]], attention disorders, violent behavior, and can even cause death.&lt;ref name="Child Welfare Information Gateway"&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Abuse and Neglect|url = https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/can/|work = Long-term consequences of child Abuse and Neglect|accessdate = 30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal definition==
In [[English law]], ''neglect'' is a [[term of art]], identical to the (now deprecated) expression ''lack of care'' and different from the concept of ''[[negligence]]''. Its sole function is to qualify a verdict returned at an [[inquest (England and Wales)|inquest]] by finding that it was a factor that contributed to a death.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Mackay of Clashfern (ed.) (2006) ''Halsbury's Laws of England'', 4th ed. reissue, vol.9(2), "Coroners", '''1035. Lack of care, neglect and self-neglect'''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of neglect==
There are many different types of neglect but they all have consequences, whether it be physically or mentally. Neglect can affect the body physically by affecting a child's development and health, sometimes leading to chronic medical problems. [[Child neglect|Children experiencing neglect]] often suffer from [[malnutrition]], which causes abnormal patterns for development. Not being given the proper nutrients at certain growth periods can result in [[stunted growth]], and inadequate bone and muscle growth. Brain functioning and [[information processing]] may also be affected by neglect. This may lead to difficulty in understanding directions, poor understanding of social relationships, or the inability to complete academic tasks without assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pledge|first=Deanna|title=Neglect|url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Kau-Nu/Neglect.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neglected children or adults can have physical injuries like [[fractures]] or severe burns that go untreated, or [[infections]], [[lice]] and other signs of lack of care. There are many physical effects neglect can have on a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Depanfillis|first=Diane|title=Child Neglect: A Guide for Prevention, Assessment and Intervention.|url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/usermanuals/neglect/chapterthree.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only is neglect associated with physical problems; it also has an effect on a person mentally, ranging from poor peer relationships to violent behavior. Not only is behavior affected, but the way a person looks at themselves, which can lead to low self-esteem and the feeling of being unwanted. Neglect is more severe in younger children when it comes to psychological consequences. Parental detachment can harm the child's development of bonding and attachment to the parents, causing the child's expectations to be the same when they get older (furthering the [[cycle of violence|cycle of abuse]]). Too little parental availability can result in difficulties in [[problem solving]], [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with stressful situations and [[social relationships]]. Studies of neglected children show heightened levels of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[hopelessness]], and higher incidents of [[suicide attempts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Council|first=Panel on Research on Child Abuse and Neglect, Commission on Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, National Research|title=Understanding child abuse and neglect|year=1993|publisher=National Academy Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-585-02166-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK98799/ |title=Analysis of Elder Abuse and Neglect Definitions Under State Law|year=2003 |website= |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |access-date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30283">In [[quantum mechanics]], a '''parity transformation''' (also called '''parity inversion''') is the flip in the sign of ''one'' [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] [[coordinate]]. In three dimensions, it can also refer to the simultaneous flip in the sign of all three spatial coordinates (a [[point reflection]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}: \begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix} \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}-x\\-y\\-z\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

It can also be thought of as a test for [[Chirality (physics)|chirality]] of a physical phenomenon, in that a parity inversion transforms a phenomenon into its mirror image. All fundamental interactions of [[elementary particle]]s, with the exception of the [[weak interaction]], are symmetric under parity. The weak interaction is chiral and thus provides a means for probing chirality in physics. In interactions that are symmetric under parity, such as electromagnetism in atomic and molecular physics, parity serves as a powerful controlling principle underlying quantum transitions.

A matrix representation of '''P''' (in any number of dimensions) has [[determinant]] equal to −1, and hence is distinct from a [[rotation]], which has a determinant equal to 1. In a two-dimensional plane, a simultaneous flip of all coordinates in sign is ''not'' a parity transformation; it is the same as a 180°-[[rotation]].

In [[quantum mechanics]], wave functions which are unchanged by a parity transformation are described as [[Even and odd functions|even]] functions, while those which change sign under a parity transformation are odd functions.

==Simple symmetry relations==
Under [[rotation]]s, classical geometrical objects can be classified into [[scalar (physics)|scalars]], [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s, and [[tensor]]s of higher rank. In [[classical physics]], physical configurations need to transform under [[group representation|representation]]s of every symmetry group.

[[quantum mechanics|Quantum theory]] predicts that states in a [[Hilbert space]] do not need to transform under representations of the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of rotations, but only under [[projective representation]]s.  The word ''projective'' refers to the fact that if one projects out the phase of each state, where we recall that the overall phase of a quantum state is not an observable, then a projective representation reduces to an ordinary representation.  All representations are also projective representations, but the converse is not true, therefore the projective representation condition on quantum states is weaker than the representation condition on classical states.

The projective representations of any group are isomorphic to the ordinary representations of a [[Group extension#Central extension|central extension]] of the group.  For example, [[projective representation]]s of the 3-dimensional rotation group, which is the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(3), are ordinary representations of the [[special unitary group]] SU(2) (see [[Representation theory of SU(2)]]).  Projective representations of the rotation group that are not representations are called [[spinor]]s, and so quantum states may transform not only as tensors but also as spinors.

If one adds to this a classification by parity, these can be extended, for example, into notions of
*''scalars'' ({{nowrap|1=''P'' = +1}}) and ''[[pseudoscalar (physics)|pseudoscalar]]s'' ({{nowrap|1=''P'' = −1}}) which are rotationally invariant.
*''vectors'' ({{nowrap|1=''P'' = −1}}) and ''axial vectors'' (also called ''[[pseudovector]]s'') ({{nowrap|1=''P'' = +1}}) which both transform as vectors under rotation.

One can define '''reflections''' such as

:&lt;math&gt;V_x: \begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix} \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}-x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

which also have negative determinant and form a valid parity transformation. Then, combining them with rotations (or successively performing ''x''-, ''y''-, and ''z''-reflections) one can recover the particular parity transformation defined earlier. The first parity transformation given does not work in an even number of dimensions, though, because it results in a positive determinant. In odd number of dimensions only the latter example of a parity transformation (or any reflection of an odd number of coordinates) can be used.

Parity forms the [[abelian group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt; due to the relation &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal P}^2 = \hat{1}&lt;/math&gt;. All Abelian groups have only one-dimensional [[irreducible representations]]. For &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt;, there are two irreducible representations: one is even under parity, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal P}\phi = +\phi&lt;/math&gt;, the other is odd, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal P}\phi = -\phi&lt;/math&gt;. These are useful in [[quantum mechanics]].  However, as is elaborated below, in quantum mechanics states need not transform under actual representations of parity but only under projective representations and so in principle a parity transformation may rotate a state by any [[phase (waves)|phase]].

==Classical mechanics==

Newton's equation of motion &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}=m\,\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt; (if the mass is constant) equates two vectors, and hence is invariant under parity. The law of gravity also involves only vectors and is also, therefore, invariant under parity.

However, angular momentum &lt;math&gt;\vec{L}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[axial vector]],
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{L}=\vec{r}\times\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{P}\left(\vec{L}\right)=-\,\vec{r}\times-\,\vec{p} = \vec{L}&lt;/math&gt;.

In classical [[electrodynamics]], the charge density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar, the electric field, &lt;math&gt;\vec{E}&lt;/math&gt;, and current &lt;math&gt;\vec{j}&lt;/math&gt; are vectors, but the magnetic field, &lt;math&gt;\vec{H}&lt;/math&gt; is an axial vector. However, Maxwell's equations are invariant under parity because the curl of an axial vector is a vector.

==Effect of spatial inversion on some variables of classical physics==

===Even===
Classical variables, predominantly scalar quantities, which do not change upon spatial inversion include:
:&lt;math&gt;\ t&lt;/math&gt;, the [[time]] when an event occurs
:&lt;math&gt;\ m&lt;/math&gt;, the [[mass]] of a particle
:&lt;math&gt;\ E&lt;/math&gt;, the [[energy]] of the particle
:&lt;math&gt;\ P&lt;/math&gt;, [[Power (physics)|power]] (rate of [[work (physics)|work]] done)
:&lt;math&gt;\ \rho&lt;/math&gt;, the electric [[charge density]]
:&lt;math&gt;\ V&lt;/math&gt;, the [[electric potential]] ([[volt]]age)
:&lt;math&gt;\ \rho&lt;/math&gt;, [[energy density]] of the [[electromagnetic field]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf L&lt;/math&gt;, the [[angular momentum]] of a particle (both [[orbital motion|orbital]] and [[Spin (physics)|spin]])  (axial vector)
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf B&lt;/math&gt;, the [[magnetic field]] (axial vector)
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf H&lt;/math&gt;, the [[magnetic field#The Difference between B and H|auxiliary magnetic field]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf M&lt;/math&gt;, the [[magnetization]]
:&lt;math&gt;\ T_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; [[Maxwell stress tensor]].
:All masses, charges, coupling constants, and other physical constants, except those associated with the weak force

===Odd===
Classical variables, predominantly vector quantities, which have their sign flipped by spatial inversion include:
:&lt;math&gt;\ h&lt;/math&gt;, the [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]]
:&lt;math&gt;\ \Phi&lt;/math&gt;, the [[magnetic flux]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt;, the [[position (vector)|position]] of a particle in three-space
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf v&lt;/math&gt;, the [[velocity]] of a particle
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf a&lt;/math&gt;, the [[acceleration]] of the particle
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf p&lt;/math&gt;, the [[linear momentum]] of a particle
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt;, the [[force (physics)|force]] exerted on a particle
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf J&lt;/math&gt;, the electric [[current density]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E&lt;/math&gt;, the [[electric field]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf D&lt;/math&gt;, the [[electric displacement field]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf P&lt;/math&gt;, the [[electric polarization]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt;, the electromagnetic [[vector potential]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf S&lt;/math&gt;, [[Poynting vector]].

==Quantum mechanics==

===Possible eigenvalues===

[[Image:parity 1drep.png|thumb|200px|right|Two dimensional representations of parity are given by a pair of quantum states which go into each other under parity. However, this representation can always be reduced to linear combinations of states, each of which is either even or odd under parity. One says that all [[irreducible representation]]s of parity are one-dimensional.]]

In [[quantum mechanics]], spacetime transformations act on [[quantum states]]. The parity transformation, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal P}&lt;/math&gt;, is a [[unitary operator]], in general acting on a state &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; as follows: &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal P}\, \psi_{\left(r\right)} = e^{\frac{i\phi}{2}}\psi_{\left(-r\right)}&lt;/math&gt;.

One must then have &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal P}^2\, \psi_{\left(r\right)} = e^{i\phi}\psi_{\left(r\right)}&lt;/math&gt;, since an overall phase is unobservable. The operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal P}^2&lt;/math&gt;, which reverses the parity of a state twice, leaves the spacetime invariant, and so is an internal symmetry which rotates its eigenstates by phases &lt;math&gt;e^{i\phi}&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal P}^2&lt;/math&gt; is an element &lt;math&gt;e^{iQ}&lt;/math&gt; of a continuous U(1) symmetry group of phase rotations, then  &lt;math&gt;e^{-iQ}&lt;/math&gt;is part of this U(1) and so is also a symmetry.  In particular, we can define &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal P}' \equiv \hat{\mathcal P}\, e^{-\frac{iQ}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, which is also a symmetry, and so we can choose to call &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal P}'&lt;/math&gt; our parity operator, instead of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal P}^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that &lt;math&gt;{\hat{\mathcal P}'}^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal P}'&lt;/math&gt; has eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;. Wave functions with eigenvalue +1 under a parity transformation are [[even and odd functions|even functions]], while eigenvalue -1 corresponds to odd functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=Ira N. |date=1991 |title=Quantum Chemistry |edition=4th |publisher=Prentice-Hall |page=163 |isbn=0-205-12770-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when no such symmetry group exists, it may be that all parity transformations have some eigenvalues which are phases other than  &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;.

For electronic wavefunctions, even states are usually indicated by a subscript g for ''gerade'' (German: even) and odd states by a subscript u for ''ungerade'' (German: odd). For example, the lowest energy level of the hydrogen molecule ion (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is labelled &lt;math&gt;1\sigma_g&lt;/math&gt; and the next-closest (higher) energy level is labelled &lt;math&gt;1\sigma_u&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=Ira N. |date=1991 |title=Quantum Chemistry |edition=4th |publisher=Prentice-Hall |page=355 |isbn=0-205-12770-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wave functions of a particle moving into an external potential, which is [[Centrosymmetry|centrosymmetric]] (potential energy invariant with respect to a space inversion, symmetric to the origin), either remain invariable or change signs: these two possible states are called the even state or odd state of the wave functions.&lt;ref name ="Andrew, chapter 2" &gt;{{cite book|title= Atomic spectroscopy. Introduction of theory to Hyperfine Structure|language= en|first1= A. V.|last1= Andrew|date= 2006|p=274|ISBN= 978-0-387-25573-6|chapter= 2. [[Schrödinger equation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law of conservation of parity of particle (not true for the [[beta decay]] of nuclei&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|title= "Parity non-conservation in β-decay of nuclei: revisiting experiment and theory fifty years after. IV. Parity breaking models"|author= Mladen Georgiev |date= November 20, 2008 |p=26 |arxiv= 0811.3403}}&lt;/ref&gt;) states that, if an isolated ensemble of particles has a definite parity, then the parity  remains invariable in the process of ensemble evolution.

The parity of the states of a particle moving in a spherically symmetric external field is determined by the [[angular momentum operator|angular momentum]], and the particle state is defined by three quantum numbers: total energy, angular momentum and the projection of angular momentum.&lt;ref name= "Andrew, chapter 2" /&gt;

===Consequences of parity symmetry===

When parity generates the [[Abelian group]] ℤ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, one can always take linear combinations of quantum states such that they are either even or odd under parity (see the figure). Thus the parity of such states is ±1. The parity of a multiparticle state is the product of the parities of each state; in other words parity is a multiplicative quantum number.

In quantum mechanics, [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]s are [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] (symmetric) under a parity transformation if &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal{P}}&lt;/math&gt; [[commutator|commutes]] with the Hamiltonian. In non-relativistic [[quantum mechanics]], this happens for any potential which is scalar, i.e., &lt;math&gt; V = V{\left(r\right)}&lt;/math&gt;, hence the potential is spherically symmetric. The following facts can be easily proven:
*If &lt;math&gt;\left| \varphi \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \psi \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; have the same parity, then &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \varphi\right| \hat{X} \left|\psi \right\rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[position operator]].
*For a state &lt;math&gt;\left|\vec{L},L_z\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; of orbital angular momentum &lt;math&gt;\vec{L}&lt;/math&gt; with z-axis projection &lt;math&gt;L_z&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal{P}} \left|\vec{L},L_z\right\rangle = \left(-1\right)^{L} \left|\vec{L},L_z\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.
*If &lt;math&gt;\left[\hat{H},\hat{P}\right] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, then atomic dipole transitions only occur between states of opposite parity.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*If &lt;math&gt;\left[\hat{H},\hat{P}\right] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, then a non-degenerate eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt; is also an eigenstate of the parity operator; i.e., a non-degenerate eigenfunction of &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt; is either invariant to &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal{P}}&lt;/math&gt; or is changed in sign by &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal{P}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Some of the non-degenerate eigenfunctions of &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt; are unaffected (invariant) by parity &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal{P}}&lt;/math&gt; and the others will be merely reversed in sign when the Hamiltonian operator and the parity operator [[commutator|commute]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal{P}}\left| \psi \right\rangle = c \left| \psi \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, the [[eigenvalue]] of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal{P}}&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal{P}}^2\left| \psi \right\rangle = c\,\hat{\mathcal{P}}\left| \psi \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

==Many-particle systems: atoms, molecules, nuclei==

The overall parity of a many-particle system is the product of the parities of the one-particle states. It is -1 if an odd number of particles are in odd-parity states, and +1 otherwise. Different notations are in use to denote the parity of nuclei, atoms, and molecules.

===Atoms===
[[Atomic orbital]]s have parity (-1)&lt;sup&gt;ℓ&lt;/sup&gt;, where the exponent ℓ is the [[azimuthal quantum number]]. The parity is odd for orbitals p, f, ... with ℓ = 1, 3, ..., and an atomic state has odd parity if an odd number of electrons occupy these orbitals. For example, the ground state of the nitrogen atom has the electron configuration 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and is identified by the term symbol &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;, where the superscript o denotes odd parity. However the third excited term at about 83,300&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; above the ground state has electron configuration 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3s has even parity since there are only two 2p electrons, and its term symbol is &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;P (without an o superscript).&lt;ref name=NIST&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/levels_form.html NIST Atomic Spectrum Database] To read the nitrogen atom energy levels, type "N I" in the Spectrum box and click on Retrieve data.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecules===
Only some molecules have a centre of symmetry, including all homonuclear [[diatomic molecule]]s as well as certain symmetric molecules including [[ethylene]],  [[benzene]], [[xenon tetrafluoride]] and [[sulphur hexafluoride]]. For such centrosymmetric molecules, the parity each [[molecular orbital]] is either g (gerade or even) or u (ungerade or odd). An electronic state is u if and only if it contains an odd number of electrons in u orbitals.

For molecules with no centre of symmetry, including all heteronuclear diatomics as well as the majority of polyatomics, inversion is not a symmetry operation and the orbitals and states cannot be described as even or odd.

===Nuclei===
In atomic nuclei, the state of each nucleon (proton or neutron) has even or odd parity, and nucleon configurations can be predicted using the [[nuclear shell model]]. As for electrons in atoms, the nucleon state has odd overall parity if and only if the number of nucleons in odd-parity states is odd. The parity is usually written as a + (even) or – (odd) following the nuclear spin value. For example the [[isotopes of oxygen]] include &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O(5/2+), meaning that the spin is 5/2 and the parity is even. The shell model explains this because the first 16 nucleons are paired so that each pair has spin zero and even parity, and the last nucleon is in the 1d&lt;sub&gt;5/2&lt;/sub&gt; shell which has even parity since ℓ = 2 for a d orbital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cottingham |first1=W.N. |last2=Greenwood |first2=D.A. |date=1986 |title=An introduction to nuclear physics |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0 521 31960 9 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantum field theory==
:''The intrinsic parity assignments in this section are true for relativistic quantum mechanics as well as quantum field theory.''

If we can show that the [[vacuum state]] is invariant under parity, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal{P}}\left| 0 \right\rangle = \left| 0 \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, the Hamiltonian is parity invariant &lt;math&gt;\left[\hat{H},\hat{\mathcal{P}}\right]&lt;/math&gt; and the quantization conditions remain unchanged under parity, then it follows that every state has [[good quantum number|good]] parity, and this parity is conserved in any reaction.

To show that [[quantum electrodynamics]] is invariant under parity, we have to prove that the action is invariant and the quantization is also invariant. For simplicity we will assume that [[canonical quantization]] is used; the vacuum state is then invariant under parity by construction. The invariance of the action follows from the classical invariance of Maxwell's equations. The invariance of the canonical quantization procedure can be worked out, and turns out to depend on the transformation of the annihilation operator{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}:
:'''Pa'''('''p''', ±)'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−'''a'''(−'''p''', ±)
where '''p''' denotes the momentum of a photon and ± refers to its polarization state. This is equivalent to the statement that the photon has odd [[intrinsic parity]]. Similarly all [[vector boson]]s can be shown to have odd intrinsic parity, and all [[pseudovector meson|axial-vectors]] to have even intrinsic parity.

There is a straightforward extension of these arguments to scalar field theories which shows that scalars have even parity, since
:'''Pa'''('''p''')'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''a'''(−'''p''').
This is true even for a complex scalar field. (''Details of [[spinor]]s are dealt with in the article on the ''[[Dirac equation]]'', where it is shown that [[fermion]]s and antifermions have opposite intrinsic parity.'')

With [[fermion]]s, there is a slight complication because there is more than one [[spin group]].

==Parity in the standard model==

===Fixing the global symmetries===
{{See also|(−1)F|l1=(−1)&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;}}
In the [[Standard Model]] of fundamental interactions there are precisely three global internal [[U(1)]] symmetry groups available, with charges equal to the [[baryon]] number ''B'', the [[lepton]] number ''L'' and the [[electric charge]] ''Q''.  The product of the parity operator with any combination of these rotations is another parity operator.  It is conventional to choose one specific combination of these rotations to define a standard parity operator, and other parity operators are related to the standard one by internal rotations.  One way to fix a standard parity operator is to assign the parities of three particles with linearly independent charges ''B'', ''L'' and ''Q''.  In general one assigns the parity of the most common massive particles, the [[proton]], the [[neutron]] and the [[electron]], to be +1.

[[Steven Weinberg]] has shown that if {{nowrap|1='''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where ''F'' is the [[fermion]] [[number operator]], then, since the fermion number is the sum of the lepton number plus the baryon number, {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''B'' + ''L''}}, for all particles in the Standard Model and since lepton number and baryon number are charges ''Q'' of continuous symmetries ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''iQ''&lt;/sup&gt;, it is possible to redefine the parity operator so that {{nowrap|1='''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}.  However, if there exist [[Majorana fermion|Majorana]] [[neutrino]]s, which experimentalists today believe is possible, their fermion number is equal to one because they are neutrinos while their baryon and lepton numbers are zero because they are Majorana, and so (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt; would not be embedded in a continuous symmetry group.  Thus Majorana neutrinos would have parity ±''i''.

===Parity of the pion===
In 1954, a paper by William Chinowsky and [[Jack Steinberger]] demonstrated that the [[pion]] has negative parity.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They studied the decay of an "atom" made from a [[deuteron]] ({{nuclide|hydrogen|2|charge=+|link=yes}}) and a negatively charged pion ({{subatomic particle|pion-}}) in a state with zero orbital [[angular momentum]] &lt;math&gt;L=0&lt;/math&gt; into two [[neutron]]s (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;).

Neutrons are [[fermion]]s and so obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]], which implies that the final state is antisymmetric.  Using the fact that the deuteron has spin one and the pion spin zero together with the antisymmetry of the final state they concluded that the two neutrons must have orbital angular momentum &lt;math&gt;L=1&lt;/math&gt;.  The total parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the particles and the extrinsic parity of the spherical harmonic function &lt;math&gt;\left(-1\right)^L&lt;/math&gt;.  Since the orbital momentum changes from zero to one in this process,  if the process is to conserve the total parity then the products of the intrinsic parities of the initial and final particles must have opposite sign.  A deuteron nucleus is made from a proton and a neutron, and so using the aforementioned convention that protons and neutrons have intrinsic parities equal to &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt; they argued that the parity of the pion is equal to minus the product of the parities of the two neutrons divided by that of the proton and neutron in the deuteron, explicitly &lt;math&gt;\frac{(-1)(1)^2}{(1)^2} = -1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus they concluded that the pion is a [[pseudoscalar particle]].

Although parity is conserved in  [[electromagnetism]], [[strong interactions]] and [[gravity]], it turns out to be violated in [[weak interactions]]. The Standard Model incorporates '''parity violation''' by expressing the weak interaction as a [[chirality (physics)|chiral]] gauge interaction. Only the left-handed components of particles and right-handed components of antiparticles participate in weak interactions in the [[Standard Model]]. This implies that parity is not a symmetry of our universe, unless a [[Mirror matter|hidden mirror sector]] exists in which parity is violated in the opposite way.

By the mid-20th century, it had been suggested by several scientists that parity might not be conserved (in different contexts), but without solid evidence these suggestions were not considered important. Then, in 1956, a careful review and analysis by theoretical physicists [[T. D. Lee|Tsung Dao Lee]] and [[C. N. Yang|Chen Ning Yang]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; went further, showing that while parity conservation had been verified in decays by the [[strong force|strong]] or [[electromagnetic interaction]]s, it was untested in the [[weak interaction]]. They proposed several possible direct experimental tests. They were mostly ignored,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} but Lee was able to convince his Columbia colleague [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] to try it.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} She needed special [[cryogenic]] facilities and expertise, so the [[The Wu Experiment|experiment]] was done at the [[National Bureau of Standards]].

In 1957 Wu, [[Ernest Ambler|E. Ambler]], R. W. Hayward, D. D. Hoppes, and R. P. Hudson found a clear violation of parity conservation in the beta decay of [[cobalt-60]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the experiment was winding down, with double-checking in progress, Wu informed Lee and Yang of their positive results, and saying the results need further examination, she asked them not to publicize the results first. However, Lee revealed the results to his Columbia colleagues on 4 January 1957 at a "Friday Lunch" gathering of the Physics Department of Columbia.&lt;!--ref&gt;江才健 ''吳健雄: 物理科學的第一夫人'' p.216 時報文化出版企業股份有限公司 ISBN 957-13-2110-9&lt;/ref--&gt; Three of them, [[Richard Garwin|R.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They delayed publication of their results until after Wu's group was ready, and the two papers appeared back to back in the same physics journal.

After the fact, it was noted that an obscure 1928 experiment had in effect reported parity violation in [[weak decay]]s, but since the appropriate concepts had not yet been developed, those results had no impact.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of parity violation immediately explained the outstanding [[Kaon#Parity violation|τ–θ puzzle]] in the physics of [[kaon]]s.

In 2010, it was reported that physicists working with the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] (RHIC) had created a short-lived parity symmetry-breaking bubble in [[quark-gluon plasma]]s. An experiment conducted by several physicists including Yale's Jack Sandweiss as part of the STAR collaboration, suggested that parity may also be violated in the strong interaction.&lt;ref&gt;

===Intrinsic parity of hadrons===
To every particle one can assign an '''intrinsic parity''' as long as nature preserves parity. Although [[weak interaction]]s do not, one can still assign a parity to any [[hadron]] by examining the [[strong interaction]] reaction that produces it, or through decays not involving the [[weak interaction]], such as [[rho meson]] decay to [[pion]]s.

{{For|the film|Phenomenon (film)}}

A '''phenomenon''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: φαινόμενον, ''phainómenon'', from the verb ''phainein'', to show, shine, appear, to be manifest or manifest itself, plural '''phenomena''')&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/ashgtvd/phenomenon_phenomena |title=Phenomenon/Phenomena |publisher=Dictionary of Visual Discourse: A Dialectical Lexicon of Terms |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is any thing which manifests itself. Phenomena are often, but not always, understood as "things that appear" or "[[experience]]s" for a [[sentient]] being, or in principle may be so.

The term came into its modern philosophical usage through [[Immanuel Kant]], who contrasted it with the [[noumenon]]. In contrast to a phenomenon, a noumenon cannot be directly observed. Kant was heavily influenced by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in this part of his philosophy, in which phenomenon and noumenon serve as interrelated technical terms. Far predating this, the [[Ancient Greek Philosophy|ancient Greek]] [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] also used phenomenon and noumenon as interrelated technical terms.

[[File:Cloud chamber bionerd.jpg|thumb|[[Cloud chamber]] phenomena. Scientists use phenomena to refine some [[hypotheses]] and sometimes to disprove a [[theory]]. See also [[:Image:Cloud chamber ani bionerd.gif|animated version]].]]

==Modern philosophical usage==
In modern philosophical use, the term 'phenomena' has come to mean 'what is experienced is the basis of [[reality]]'.  In Immanuel Kant's ''Inaugural Dissertation, On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World'' (1770), Kant theorizes that the human mind is restricted to the logical world and thus can only interpret and understand occurrences according to their physical appearances.  He wrote that humans could infer only as much as their senses allowed, but not experience the actual object itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Kant's Inaugural Dissertation of 1770]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the term phenomenon refers to any incident deserving of inquiry and investigation, especially events that are particularly unusual or of distinctive importance.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; According to The Columbia Encyclopedia, "Modern philosophers have used 'phenomenon' to designate what is apprehended before judgment is applied."&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/columency/phenomenon |title=Phenomenon |publisher=The Columbia Encyclopedia |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may not be possible if observation is [[theory-ladenness|theory laden]].

==Scientific==
{{See also|Phenomenalism}}
[[File:Space Fire.jpg|thumb|right|A comparison between a candle flame on Earth (left) and in a [[microgravity]] environment, such as that found on the [[International Space Station]] (right).&lt;br&gt;
The same ''burning'' phenomenon is [[observation|observed]], but different flame ''shape'' and ''colouring'' phenomena are also observed.]]
[[File:Streichholz.jpg|thumb|upright|The combustion of a match is an observable occurrence, or event, and therefore a phenomenon.]]

In scientific usage, a phenomenon is any event that is observable, however common it might be, even if it requires the use of instrumentation to observe, record, or compile data concerning it. For example, in [[physics]], a phenomenon may be described by a system of [[information]] related to [[matter]], [[energy]], or [[spacetime]], such as [[Isaac Newton]]'s observations of the [[moon]]'s orbit and of [[universal gravitation|gravity]], or [[Galileo Galilei]]'s observations of the motion of a [[pendulum]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Bernstein, &lt;cite&gt;A Theory for Everything&lt;/cite&gt;, Copernicus, An imprint of Springer-Verlag, New York, 1996, hardback, {{ISBN|0-387-94700-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of scientific phenomena can be found in the experience of [[phantom limb]] sensations.  This occurrence, the sensation of feeling in amputated limbs, is reported by over 70% of amputees.  Although the limb is no longer present, they report still experiencing sensations. This is an extraordinary event that defies typical logic and has been a source of much curiosity within the medical and physiological fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Montoyaa | first1 = Pedro | last2 = Larbiga | first2 = Wolfgang | last3 = Grulkea | first3 = Norbert | last4 = Florb | first4 = Herta | last5 = Taubc | first5 = Edward | last6 = Birbaumera | first6 = Niels | year = 1997 | title = The Relationship of Phantom Limb Pain to Other Phantom Limb Phenomena in Upper Extremity Amputees | url = | journal = Pain | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 87–93 | doi=10.1016/s0304-3959(97)00004-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical==
A '''mechanical phenomenon''' is a physical phenomenon associated with the [[dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] or [[motion (physics)|motion]] of objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.audioenglish.net/dictionary/mechanical_phenomenon.htm  |title=Mechanical phenomenon |publisher=Audioenglish.net |accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples are [[Newton's cradle]], [[engine]]s, and [[double pendulum]]s.

==Group and social==
{{see also|Social phenomenon}}
Group phenomena concern the behavior of a particular group of individual entities, usually organisms and most especially people. The behavior of individuals often changes in a group setting in various ways, and a group may have its own behaviors not possible for an individual because of the [[herd mentality]].

Social phenomena apply especially to organisms and people in that subjective states are implicit in the term. Attitudes and events particular to a group may have effects beyond the group, and either be adapted by the larger society, or seen as aberrant, being punished or shunned.

==Popular usage==
In popular usage, a phenomenon often refers to an extraordinary [[Event (philosophy)|event]]. The term is most commonly used to refer to occurrences that at first defy explanation or baffle the observer. According to the ''Dictionary of Visual Discourse'', "In ordinary language 'phenomenon/phenomena' refer to any occurrence worthy of note and investigation, typically an untoward or unusual event, person or fact that is of special significance or otherwise notable."&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3909">'''Repetition blindness''' ('''RB''') is a phenomenon observed in [[rapid serial visual presentation]]. People are sometimes poor at recognizing when things happen twice. Repetition blindness is the failure to recognize a second happening of a visual display. The two displays are shortly shown usually for about 150 milliseconds, and then they are shown within 500 milliseconds of each other (Kanwisher, 1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanwisher|first=N|title=Repetition blindness: Type recognition without token individuation|journal=Cognition|year=1987|volume=27|pages=117–143|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90016-3|pmid=3691023}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Repetition blindness tasks usually are words in lists and in sentences. They are called phonologically similar items (Bavelier &amp; Potter, 1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bavelier|first=D|author2=Potter, M |title=Visual and phonological codes in repetition blindness|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also pictures, and words that include pictures. An example of this is a picture of the sun and the word sun (Bavelier, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bavelier|first=D|title=Repetition blindness between visually different items: The case of pictures and words|journal=Cognition|year=1994|issue=3|pages=199–236|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(94)90054-x|volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most popular task used to examine repetition blindness is to show words one after another on a screen fast in which participants must recall the words that they saw. This task is known as the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). Repetition blindness is present if missing the second word creates an inaccurate sentence. An example of this is "When she spilled the ink there was ink all over.” An RSVP sequence participants will recall seeing "When she spilled the ink there was all over." However, they are missing the second occurrence of "ink" (Kanwisher, 1987). This finding supports that people are "blind" for the second occurrence of a repetitive item in an RSVP series.  
For example, a subject's chances of correctly reporting both appearances of the word "cat" in the RSVP stream "dog mouse cat elephant cat snake" are lower than their chances of reporting the third and fifth words in the stream "dog mouse cat elephant pig snake".

The precise mechanism underlying RB has been extensively debated. [[Nancy Kanwisher]] has argued that it involves failure to [[tokenize]] the second appearance of a repeated stimulus, leading to the second appearance being dropped from short term memory before it can be reported.  However, Whittlesea and colleagues have argued that repetition blindness arises from a failure to properly reconstruct the list, both online and post list.  This failure to properly reconstruct the list arises from the poor encoding cues that are the result of the RSVP task.

'''Response bias''' is a general term for a wide range of tendencies for participants to respond inaccurately or falsely to questions. These biases are prevalent in research involving participant [[self-report study|self-report]], such as [[structured interview]]s or [[statistical survey|surveys]].&lt;ref name="Furnham"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(86)90014-0|title=Response bias, social desirability and dissimulation|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=7|issue=3|pages=385–400|year=1986|last1=Furnham|first1=Adrian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Response biases can have a large impact on the validity of [[questionnaire]]s or surveys.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nederhof"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420150303|title=Methods of coping with social desirability bias: A review|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=15|issue=3|pages=263–280|year=1985|last1=Nederhof|first1=Anton J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Response bias can be induced or caused by numerous factors, all relating to the idea that human subjects do not respond passively to [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]], but rather actively integrate multiple sources of information to generate a response in a given situation.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0043424|title=On the social psychology of the psychological experiment: With particular reference to demand characteristics and their implications|journal=American Psychologist|volume=17|issue=11|pages=776–783|year=1962|last1=Orne|first1=Martin T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, almost any aspect of an experimental condition may potentially bias a respondent. Examples include the phrasing of questions in surveys, the demeanor of the researcher, the way the experiment is conducted, or the desires of the participant to be a good experimental subject and to provide socially desirable responses may affect the response in some way.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalton|first1=Graham|last2=Schuman|first2=Howard|title=The Effect of the Question on Survey Responses: A Review|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series A (General)|date=1982|volume=145|issue=1|pages=42–73|doi=10.2307/2981421|jstor=2981421}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these "artifacts" of survey and self-report research may have the potential to damage the [[construct validity|validity]] of a measure or study.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; Compounding this issue is that surveys affected by response bias still often have high [[reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]], which can lure researchers into a false sense of security about the conclusions they draw.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2777936|pmid=889001|year=1977|author1=Gove|first1=W. R.|title=Response bias in surveys of mental health: An empirical investigation|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=82|issue=6|pages=1289–1317|last2=Geerken|first2=M. R.|doi=10.1086/226466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of response bias, it is possible that some study results are due to a systematic response bias rather than the [[Hypothesis|hypothesized]] effect, which can have a profound effect on [[Psychology|psychological]] and other types of research using questionnaires or surveys.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt; It is therefore important for researchers to be aware of response bias and the effect it can have on their research so that they can attempt to prevent it from impacting their findings in a negative manner.

==History of research==
Awareness of response bias has been present in [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] literature for some time because self-reporting features significantly in those fields of research. However, researchers were initially unwilling to admit the degree to which they impact, and potentially invalidate research utilizing these types of measures.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt; Some researchers believed that the biases present in a group of subjects cancel out when the group is large enough.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, H; 1954. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lj0OAQAAIAAJ ''Interviewing in Social Research.''] Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This would mean that the impact of response bias is random noise, which washes out if enough participants are included in the study.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt; However, at the time this argument was proposed, effective methodological tools that could test it were not available.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt; Once newer methodologies were developed, researchers began to investigate the impact of response bias.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt; From this renewed research, two opposing sides arose.

The first group supports Hyman's belief that although response bias exists, it often has minimal effect on participant response, and no large steps need to be taken to mitigate it.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clancy 1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clancy|first1=Kevin|last2=Gove|first2=Walter|title=Sex Differences in Mental Illness: An Analysis of Response Bias in Self-Reports|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=1974|volume=80|issue=1|pages=205–216|jstor=2776967|doi=10.1086/225767}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell 1976"&gt;Campbell, A. Converse, P. Rodgers; 1976. [https://books.google.com/books?id=h_QWAwAAQBAJ ''The Quality of American Life: Perceptions, Evaluations and Satisfaction.''] New York: Russell Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers hold that although there is significant literature identifying response bias as influencing the responses of study participants, these studies do not in fact provide [[empirical evidence]] that this is the case.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt; They subscribe to the idea that the effects of this bias wash out with large enough samples, and that it is not a systematic problem in [[mental health]] research.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clancy 1974"/&gt; These studies also call into question earlier research that investigated response bias on the basis of their [[List of psychological research methods|research methodologies]]. For example, they mention that many of the studies had very small [[Sample (statistics)|sample sizes]], or that in studies looking at [[Social desirability bias|social desirability]], a subtype of response bias, the researchers had no way to [[Quantification (science)|quantify]] the desirability of the statements used in the study.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt; Additionally, some have argued that what researchers may believe to be artifacts of response bias, such as differences in responding between men and women, may in fact be actual differences between the two groups.&lt;ref name="Clancy 1974"/&gt; Several other studies also found evidence that response bias is not as big of a problem as it may seem. The first found that when comparing the responses of participants, with and without controls for response bias, their answers to the surveys were not [[Statistical significance|different]].&lt;ref name="Clancy 1974"/&gt; Two other studies found that although the bias may be present, the effects are extremely small, having little to no impact towards dramatically changing or altering the responses of participants.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gove 1976"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0037-7856(76)90118-9|title=Response bias in community surveys of mental health: Systematic bias or random noise?|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=10|issue=9–10|pages=497–502|year=1976|last1=Gove|first1=Walter R.|last2=McCorkel|first2=James|last3=Fain|first3=Terry|last4=Hughes|first4=Michael D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second group argues against Hyman's point, saying that response bias has a significant effect, and that researchers need to take steps to reduce response bias in order to conduct sound research.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; They argue that the impact of response bias is a [[systematic error]] inherent to this type of research and that it needs to be addressed in order for studies to be able to produce accurate results. In psychology, there are many studies exploring the impact of response bias in many different settings and with many different [[Variable and attribute (research)|variables]]. For example, some studies have found effects of response bias in the reporting of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] in elderly patients.&lt;ref name="Knauper 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0022-3956(94)90026-4|pmid=7932277|title=Diagnosing major depression in the elderly: Evidence for response bias in standardized diagnostic interviews?|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|volume=28|issue=2|pages=147–164|year=1994|last1=Knäuper|first1=Bärbel|last2=Wittchen|first2=Hans-Ulrich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have found that there are serious issues when responses to a given survey or questionnaire have responses that may seem desirable or undesirable to report, and that a person's responses to certain questions can be biased by their culture.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0022022104264122|title=Standardization to Account for Cross-Cultural Response Bias: A Classification of Score Adjustment Procedures and Review of Research in JCCP|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|volume=35|issue=3|pages=263–282 |year=2004|last1=Fischer|first1=Ronald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is support for the idea that simply being part of an experiment can have dramatic effects on how participants act, thus biasing anything that they may do in a research or experimental setting when it comes to self-reporting.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt; One of the most influential studies was one which found that social desirability bias, a type of response bias, can account for as much as 10–70% of the [[variance]] in participant response.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; Essentially, because of several findings that illustrate the dramatic effects response bias has on the outcomes of self-report research, this side supports the idea that steps need to be taken to mitigate the effects of response bias to maintain the accuracy of research.

While both sides have support in the literature, there appears to be greater empirical support for the significance of response bias.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reese 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/jclp.21946|pmid=23349082|title=The Influence of Demand Characteristics and Social Desirability on Clients' Ratings of the Therapeutic Alliance|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|volume=69|issue=7|pages=696–709|year=2013|last1=Reese|first1=Robert J.|last2=Gillaspy|first2=J. Arthur|last3=Owen|first3=Jesse J.|last4=Flora|first4=Kevin L.|last5=Cunningham|first5=Linda C.|last6=Archie|first6=Danielle|last7=Marsden|first7=Troymichael}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cronbach"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0054677|title=Studies of acquiescence as a factor in the true-false test|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=33|issue=6|pages=401–415|year=1942|last1=Cronbach|first1=L. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To add strength to the claims of those who argue the importance of response bias, many of the studies that reject the significance of response bias report multiple methodological issues in their studies. For example, they have extremely small samples that are not representative of the population as a whole, they only considered a small subset of potential variables that could be affected by response bias, and their measurements were conducted over the phone with poorly worded statements.&lt;ref name="Gove 1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clancy 1974"/&gt;

==Types==

===Acquiescence bias===
{{Main|Acquiescence bias}}

Acquiescence bias, which is also referred to as "yea-saying", is a category of response bias in which respondents to a [[Sample survey|survey]] have a tendency to agree with all the questions in a [[Psychological testing|measure]].&lt;ref name="Watson"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0049124192021001003|title=Correcting for Acquiescent Response Bias in the Absence of a Balanced Scale: An Application to Class Consciousness|journal=Sociological Methods &amp; Research|volume=21|pages=52–88|year=1992|last1=Watson|first1=D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Psychlopedia"&gt;[http://www.psych-it.com.au/Psychlopedia/article.asp?id=154 Moss, Simon. (2008).  Acquiescence bias]&lt;/ref&gt; This bias in responding may represent a form of dishonest reporting because the participant automatically endorses any statements, even if the result is contradictory responses.&lt;ref name="Knowles 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1006/jrpe.1997.2180|title=Acquiescent Responding in Self-Reports: Cognitive Style or Social Concern?|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=31|issue=2|pages=293–301|year=1997|last1=Knowles|first1=Eric S.|last2=Nathan|first2=Kobi T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meisenberg 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2008.01.010|title=Are acquiescent and extreme response styles related to low intelligence and education?|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=44|issue=7|pages=1539–1550|year=2008|last1=Meisenberg|first1=Gerhard|last2=Williams|first2=Amandy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a [[Research participant|participant]] could be asked whether they endorse the following statement, "I prefer to spend time with others" but then later on in the survey also endorses "I prefer to spend time alone," which are contradictory statements. This is a distinct problem for self-report research because it does not allow a researcher to understand or gather accurate data from any type of question that asks for a participant to endorse or reject statements.&lt;ref name="Knowles 1997"/&gt; Researchers have approached this issue by thinking about the bias in two different ways. The first deals with the idea that participants are trying to be agreeable, in order to avoid the disapproval of the researcher.&lt;ref name="Knowles 1997"/&gt; A second cause for this type of bias was proposed by [[Lee Cronbach]], when he argued that it is likely due to a problem in the [[Cognition|cognitive processes]] of the participant, instead of the motivation to please the researcher.&lt;ref name="Cronbach"/&gt; He argues that it may be due to biases in memory where an individual recalls information that supports endorsement of the statement, and ignores contradicting information.&lt;ref name="Cronbach"/&gt;

Researchers have several methods to try and reduce this form of bias. Primarily, they attempt to make balanced response sets in a given measure, meaning that there are a balanced number of positively and negatively worded questions.&lt;ref name="Knowles 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Podsakoff 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879|pmid=14516251|title=Common method biases in behavioral research: A critical review of the literature and recommended remedies|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=88|issue=5|pages=879–903|year=2003|last1=Podsakoff|first1=Philip M.|last2=MacKenzie|first2=Scott B.|last3=Lee|first3=Jeong-Yeon|last4=Podsakoff|first4=Nathan P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that if a researcher was hoping to examine a certain trait with a given questionnaire, half of the questions would have a "yes" response to identify the trait, and the other half would have a "no" response to identify the trait.&lt;ref name="Podsakoff 2003"/&gt;

Nay-saying is the opposite form of this bias. It occurs when a participant always chooses to deny or not endorse any statements in a survey or measure. This has a similar effect of invalidating any kinds of endorsements that participants may make over the course of the experiment.

===Demand characteristics===
{{Main|Demand characteristics}}

Demand characteristics refer to a type of response bias where participants alter their response or behavior simply because they are part of an experiment.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt; This arises because participants are actively engaged in the experiment, and may try and figure out the purpose, or adopt certain [[Human behavior|behaviors]] they believe belong in an experimental setting. [[Martin Orne]] was one of the first to identify this type of bias, and has developed several theories to address their cause.&lt;ref&gt;Orne, Martin T. Demand Characteristics and the concept of Quasi-Controls. in [https://books.google.com/books?id=CBAYztKB-D0C&amp;pg=PA110 Artifacts in Behavioral Research: Robert Rosenthal and Ralph L. Rosnow's Classic Books, beginning with page 110]&lt;/ref&gt; His research points to the idea that participants enter a certain type of social interaction when engaging in an experiment, and this special social interaction drives participants to [[Consciousness|consciously]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]] alter their behaviors&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt; There are several ways that this bias can influence participants and their responses in an experimental setting. One of the most common relates to the motivations of the participant. Many people choose to volunteer to be in studies because they believe that experiments are important. This drives participants to be "good subjects" and fulfill their role in the experiment properly, because they believe that their proper participation is vital to the success of the study.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichols 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3200/GENP.135.2.151-166|pmid=18507315|title=The Good-Subject Effect: Investigating Participant Demand Characteristics|journal=The Journal of General Psychology|volume=135|issue=2|pages=151–165|year=2008|last1=Nichols|first1=Austin Lee|last2=Maner|first2=Jon K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in an attempt to productively participate, the subject may try to gain knowledge of the hypothesis being tested in the experiment and alter their behavior in an attempt to support that [[hypothesis]]. Orne conceptualized this change by saying that the experiment may appear to a participant as a problem, and it is his or her job to find the solution to that problem, which would be behaving in a way that would lend support to the experimenter's hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt; Alternatively, a participant may try to discover the hypothesis simply to provide faulty information and wreck the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Nichols 2008"/&gt; Both of these results are harmful because they prevent the experimenters from gathering accurate data and making sound conclusions.

Outside of participant motivation, there are other factors that influence the appearance of demand characteristics in a study. Many of these factors relate to the unique nature of the experimental setting itself. For example, participants in studies are more likely to put up with uncomfortable or tedious tasks simply because they are in an experiment.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt; Additionally, the [[Nonverbal communication|mannerisms]] of the experimenter, such as the way they greet the participant, or the way they interact with the participant during the course of the experiment may inadvertently bias how the participant responds during the course of the experiment.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook 1970" /&gt; Also, prior experiences of being in an experiment, or rumors of the experiment that participants may hear can greatly bias the way they respond.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichols 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook 1970" /&gt; Outside of an experiment, these types of past experiences and mannerisms may have significant effects on how patients rank the effectiveness of their [[Mental health professional|therapist]].&lt;ref name="Reese 2013"/&gt; Many of the ways therapists go about collecting client feedback involve self-reporting measures, which can be highly influenced by response bias.&lt;ref name="Reese 2013"/&gt; Participants may be biased if they fill out these measure in front of their therapist, or somehow feel compelled to answer in an affirmative matter because they believe their therapy should be working.&lt;ref name="Reese 2013"/&gt; In this case, the therapists would not be able to gain accurate feedback from their clients, and be unable to improve their therapy or accurately tailor further treatment to what the participants need.&lt;ref name="Reese 2013"/&gt;  All of these different examples may have significant effects on the responses of participants, driving them to respond in ways that do not reflect their actual beliefs or actual mindset, which negatively impact conclusions drawn from those surveys.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt;

While demand characteristics cannot be completely removed from an experiment, there are steps that researchers can take to minimize the impact they may have on the results.&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt; One way to mitigate response bias is to use deception to prevent the participant from discovering the true hypothesis of the experiment&lt;ref name="Cook 1970"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0028849|title=Demand characteristics and three conceptions of the frequently deceived subject|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=14|issue=3|pages=185–194|year=1970|last1=Cook|first1=Thomas D.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[Debriefing|debrief]] the participants.&lt;ref name="Cook 1970"/&gt; For example, research has demonstrated that repeated deception and debriefing is useful in preventing participants from becoming familiar with the experiment, and that participants do not significantly alter their behaviors after being deceived and debriefed multiple times.&lt;ref name="Cook 1970"/&gt; Another way that researchers attempt to reduce demand characteristics is by being as [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutral]] as possible, or training those conducting the experiment to be as neutral as possible.&lt;ref name="Nichols 2008"/&gt; For example, studies show that extensive one-on-one contact between the experimenter and the participant makes it more difficult to be neutral, and go on to suggest that this type of interaction should be limited when designing an experiment.&lt;ref name="Podsakoff 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichols 2008"/&gt; Another way to prevent demand characteristics is to use [[Blind experiment|blinded]] experiments with [[placebo]]s or [[Treatment and control groups|control groups]].&lt;ref name="Orne 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Podsakoff 2003"/&gt; This prevents the experimenter from biasing the participant, because the researcher does not know in which way the participant should respond. Although not perfect, these methods can significantly reduce the effect of demand characteristics on a study, thus making the conclusions drawn from the experiment more likely to accurately reflect what they were intended to measure.&lt;ref name="Nichols 2008"/&gt;

===Extreme responding===

Extreme responding is a form of response bias that drives respondents to only select the most extreme options or answers available.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meisenberg 2008"/&gt; For example, in a survey utilizing a [[Likert scale]] with potential responses ranging from one to five, the respondent may only give answers as ones or fives. Another example is if the participant only answered questionnaires with "strongly agree" or "strongly disagree" in a survey with that type of response style. There are several reasons for why this bias may take hold in a group of participants. One example ties the development of this type of bias in respondents to their cultural identity.&lt;ref name="Meisenberg 2008"/&gt; This explanation states that people from certain cultures are more likely to respond in an extreme manner as compared to others. For example, research has found that those from the Middle East and Latin America are more prone to be affected by extremity response, whereas those from East Asia and Western Europe are less likely to be affected.&lt;ref name="Meisenberg 2008"/&gt; A second explanation for this type of response bias relates to the education level of the participants.&lt;ref name="Meisenberg 2008"/&gt; Research has indicated that those with lower intelligence, measured by an analysis of [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] and school achievement, are more likely to be affected by extremity response.&lt;ref name="Meisenberg 2008"/&gt;  Another way that this bias can be introduced is through the wording of questions in a survey or questionnaire.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt; Certain topics or the wording of a question may drive participants to respond in an extreme manner, especially if it relates to the motivations or beliefs of the participant.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;

The opposite of this bias occurs when participants only select intermediate or mild responses as answers.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt; 

=== Question order bias ===
Question order bias, or "order effects bias", is a type of response bias where a respondent may react differently to questions based on the order in which questions appear in a survey or interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blankenship, A. . Journal Of Marketing, 6(4), 66-75.|first=Albert|date=April 1942|title=PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES IN MEASURING CONSUMER PREFERENCE|url=|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume= 6| issue = 4, p66-75|pages=9|via=Business Source Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Question order bias is different from "response order bias" that addresses specifically the order of the set of responses within a survey question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ISRAEL and TAYLOR|first=GLENN D. and C.L.|date=1990|title=Can Response Order Bias Evaluations?|url=|journal=Evaluation and Program Planning|volume=v13 n4 p365-71|pages=7|via=ERIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many ways that questionnaire items that appear earlier in a survey can affect responses to later questions. One way is when a question creates a "norm of reciprocity or fairness" as identified in the 1950 work of Herbert Hyman and Paul Sheatsley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyman and Sheatsley|first=Herbert Hiram and P. B.|date=1950|title=Current status of American Public Opnion|url=|journal=National Council for the Social Studies Yearbook|volume= 1950, p11-34|pages=24|via=Education Source}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their research they asked two questions. One was asked on whether the United States should allow reporters from communist countries to come to the U.S. and send back news as they saw it; and another question was asked on whether a communist country like Russia should let American newspaper reporters come in and send back news as they saw it to America. In the study, the percentage of “yes” responses to the question allowing communist reporters increased by 37 percentage points depending on the order. Similarly results for the American reporters item increased by 24 percentage points. When either of the items was asked second, the context for the item was changed as a result of the answer to the first, and the responses to the second were more in line with what would be considered fair, based on the previous response.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Survey Research Methods|last=Lavrakas|first=Paul J.|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|year=2008|isbn=9781412918084|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=664–665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way to alter the response towards questions based on order depends on the framing of the question. If a respondent is first asked about their general interest in a subject their response interest may be higher than if they are first posed technical or knowledge based questions about a subject.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Part-whole contrast effect is yet another ordering effect. When general and specific questions are asked in different orders, results for the specific item are generally unaffected, whereas those for the general item can change significantly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Question order biases occur primarily in survey or questionnaire settings. Some strategies to limit the effects of question order bias include randomization, grouping questions by topic to unfold in a logical order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/methodology/u-s-survey-research/questionnaire-design/|title=Questionnaire design|date=2015-01-29|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2017-11-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social desirability bias===
{{Main|Social desirability bias}}

Social desirability bias is a type of response bias that influences a participant to deny undesirable traits, and ascribe to themselves traits that are socially desirable.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; In essence, it is a bias that drives an individual to answer in a way that makes them look more favorable to the experimenter.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; This bias can take many forms. Some individuals may over-report good behavior, while others may under-report bad, or undesirable behavior.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt; A critical aspect of how this bias can come to affect the responses of participants relates to the norms of the society in which the research is taking place.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; For example, social desirability bias could play a large role if conducting research about an individual's tendency to use drugs. Those in a community where drug use is seen as acceptable or popular may exaggerate their own drug use, whereas those from a community where drug use is looked down upon may choose to under-report their own use. This type of bias is much more prevalent in questions that draw on a subject's opinion, like when asking a participant to evaluate or rate something, because there generally is not one correct answer, and the respondent has multiple ways they could answer the question.&lt;ref name="Kalton"/&gt; Overall, this bias can be very problematic for self-report researchers, especially if the topic they are looking at is controversial.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt; The distortions created by respondents answering in a socially desirable manner can have profound effects on the validity of self-report research.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; Without being able to control for or deal with this bias, researchers are unable to determine if the effects they are measuring are due to individual differences, or from a desire to [[Conformity|conform to the societal norms]] present in the population they are studying. Therefore, researchers strive to employ strategies aimed at mitigating social desirability bias so that they can draw valid conclusions from their research.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;

Several strategies exist to limit the effect of social desirability bias. In 1985, Anton Nederhof compiled a list of techniques and methodological strategies for researchers to use to mitigate the effects of social desirability bias in their studies.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; Most of these strategies involve deceiving the subject, or are related to the way questions in surveys and questionnaires are presented to those in a study. A condensed list of seven of the strategies are listed below:
*'''Ballot-box method''': This method allows a subject to anonymously self-complete a questionnaire and submit it to a locked "ballot box", thereby concealing their responses from an interviewer and affording the participant an additional layer of assured concealment from perceived social repercussion&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bova, C., Aswani, S., Farthing, M., Potts, W.|first=|date=2018|title=Limitations of the Random Response Technique and a Call to Implement the Ballot Box Method for Estimating Angler Compliance Using Surveys|url=|journal=Fisheries Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
*'''Forced-choice items''': This technique hopes to generate questions that are equal in desirability to prevent a socially desirable response in one direction or another.&lt;ref name="Nederhof" /&gt;
*'''Neutral questions''': The goal of this strategy is to use questions that are rated as neutral by a wide range of participants so that socially desirable responding does not apply.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;
*'''Randomized response technique''': This technique allows participants to answer a question that is randomly selected from a set of questions. The researcher in this technique does not know which question the subject responds to, so subjects are more likely to answer truthfully. Researchers can then use statistics to interpret the anonymous data.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;
*'''Self-administered questionnaires''': This strategy involves isolating the participant before they begin answering the survey or questionnaire to hopefully remove any social cues the researcher may present to the participant.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;
*'''Bogus-pipeline''': This technique involves a form of deception, where researchers convince a subject through a series of rigged demonstrations that a machine can accurately determine if a participant is being truthful when responding to certain questions. After the participant completes the survey or questionnaire, they are debriefed. This is a rare technique, and does not see much use because of the cost, time commitment and because it is a one-use only technique for each participant.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;
*'''Selection interviewers''': This strategy allows participants to select the person or persons who will be conducting the interview or presiding over the experiment. This, in the hope that with a higher degree of rapport, subjects will be more likely to answer honestly.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;
*'''Proxy subjects''': Instead of asking a person directly, this strategy questions someone who is close to or knows the target individual well. This technique is generally limited to questions about behavior, and is not adequate for asking about attitudes or beliefs.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt;

The degree of effectiveness for each of these techniques or strategies differs depending on the situation and the question asked.&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; In order to be the most successful in reducing social desirability bias in a wide range of situations, it has been suggested that researchers utilize a combination of these techniques to have the best chance at mitigating the effects of social desirability bias.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nederhof"/&gt; Validations are not made on a "more is better" assumption (higher stated prevalence of the behavior of interest) when selecting the best method for reducing SDB as this is a "weak validation" that does not always guarantee the best results. Instead, ground "truthed" comparisons of observed data to stated data should reveal the most accurate method&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

==Related terminology==

*[[Non-response bias]] is not the opposite of response bias and is not a type of cognitive bias: it occurs in a [[statistical survey]] if those who respond to the survey differ in the outcome variable.
*[[Response rate (survey)|Response rate]] is not a cognitive bias, but rather refers to a ratio of those who complete the survey and those who do not.

==Highly vulnerable areas==

Some areas or topics that are highly vulnerable to the various types of response bias include:
*alcoholism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.15288/jsa.1987.48.410|pmid=3312821|title=Verbal report methods in clinical research on alcoholism: Response bias and its minimization|journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol|volume=48|issue=5|pages=410–424|year=1987|last1=Babor|first1=T F|last2=Stephens|first2=R S|last3=Marlatt|first3=G A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.15288/jsa.1993.54.334|pmid=8487543|title=Validity and reliability of self-reported drinking behavior: Dealing with the problem of response bias|journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol|volume=54|issue=3|pages=334–344|year=1993|last1=Embree|first1=B G|last2=Whitehead|first2=P C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jainism}}
'''''Samvara'''''  (''saṃvara'') is one of the ''[[Tattva (Jainism)|tattva]]'' or the fundamental reality of the world as per the [[Jain philosophy]]. It means stoppage—the stoppage of the influx of the material karmas into the soul consciousness. The karmic process in Jainism is based on seven truths or fundamental principles (''tattva'') of Jainism which explain the human predicament.&lt;ref name=soni&gt;{{cite journal | last =Soni | first =Jayandra | editor =E. Craig | title =Jain Philosophy | journal =Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher =Routledge | location =London | year =1998 | url =http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/F005SECT1 | accessdate =2008-03-05 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060722002023/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/F005SECT1 | archivedate =22 July 2006 | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the seven, the four influxs (''[[asrava|āsrava]]''), bondage (''bandha''), stoppage (''saṃvara'')  and release (''[[nirjara|nirjarā]]'')—pertain to the [[Karma in Jainism|karmic process]].&lt;ref name=soni/&gt;

==Philosophical overview==
''Saṃvara'' is the first step in the destruction of accumulated harmful karmas. The world or the ''[[Samsara (Jainism)|samsara]]'' is often described as an ocean and the soul as a boat trying to cross it and reach the shores of liberation. The boat is leaking i.e. karmic particles are getting attached to the soul. Hence the first step is to stop the leak and prevent new water from entering the boat. This is ''saṃvara''. Jains assert that emancipation is not possible as long as the soul remains unreleased from the bondage of these karmas. Release is made possible by ''saṃvara''; that is, the stopping of inflow of new karmas, and ''nirjarā''; the shedding of existing harmful karma through conscious efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sanghvi | first =Sukhlal | title =Commentary on Tattvārthasūtra of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =L.

==Means of ''saṃvara''==
''Samvara'' or stoppage of karmic influx is achieved through practice of:
#Three ''guptis'' or three controls of mind, speech and body,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bhattacharya | first =H. S. | title =Jain Moral Doctrine | publisher =Jain Sahitya Vikas Mandal | year =1976 | location =Mumbai |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Ten ''dharmas'' or observation of good acts like – forgiveness, humility, straightforwardness, contentment, truthfulness, self-control, penance, renunciation, non-attachment and continence.&lt;ref name=hari46&gt;Bhattacharya, H. S. (1976) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;
#''[[Anupreksha]]s'' or meditation on the truths of this universe.&lt;ref name=hari46/&gt;
#''Pariṣahajaya'', that is, a man on moral path must develop a perfectly patient and unperturbed attitude in the midst of trying and difficult circumstances.&lt;ref name=hari46/&gt;
#''Cāritra'', that is, endeavour to remain in steady spiritual practices.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya, H. S. (1976) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual differentiation''' is the process of development of the differences between [[male]]s and [[female]]s from an undifferentiated [[zygote]]. As male and female individuals develop from zygotes into [[fetus]]es, into infants, children, adolescents, and eventually into adults, [[sex]] and [[gender]] differences at many levels develop: [[gene]]s, [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, [[hormone]]s, [[anatomy]], and [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].

[[Sex differences]] range greatly and include physiologically differentiating. Sex-dichotomous differences are developments which are wholly characteristic of one sex only. Examples of sex-dichotomous differences include aspects of the sex-specific genital organs such as [[ovary|ovaries]], a [[uterus]] or a phallic [[urethra]]. In contrast, [[sexual dimorphism|sex-dimorphic]] differences are matters of degree (e.g., size of [[Phallus#In physical anatomy|phallus]]). Some of these (e.g., [[height|stature]], behaviors) are mainly statistical, with much overlap between male and female populations.

Nevertheless, even the sex-dichotomous differences are not absolute in the human population, and there are individuals who are exceptions (e.g., XY males with a uterus; undeveloped testes), or [[XY gonadal dysgenesis|phenotypical females with an XY karyotype]] (undeveloped reproductive organs), or who exhibit biological and/or behavioral characteristics of both sexes.

Sex differences may be induced by specific [[genes]], by [[hormones]], by [[anatomy]], or by [[Social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]]. Some of the differences are entirely physical (e.g., presence of a uterus) and some differences are just as obviously purely a matter of social learning and custom (e.g., relative hair length). Many differences, though, such as [[gender identity]], appear to be influenced by both biological and social factors ([[nature versus nurture|"nature" and "nurture"]]).

The early stages of human differentiation appear to be quite similar to the same biological processes in other mammals and the interaction of genes, hormones and body structures is fairly well understood. In the first weeks of life, a [[fetus]] has no anatomic  or hormonal [[sex]], and only a [[karyotype]] distinguishes male from female. Specific genes induce [[gonad]]al differences, which produce hormonal differences, which cause anatomic differences, leading to psychological and behavioral differences, some of which are innate and some induced by the [[society|social environment]].

==Sex determination system==
{{main|Sex determination system}}

Humans, many mammals, insects and other animals have an [[XY sex-determination system]]. Humans have forty-six chromosomes, including two sex chromosomes, XX in females and [[XY sex-determination system|XY]] in males. The [[Y chromosome]] must carry at least one essential gene which determines [[testis|testicular]] formation (originally termed ''TDF''). A gene in the sex-determining region of the short arm of the Y, now referred to as ''[[SRY]]'', has been found to direct production of a protein, [[testis determining factor]], which binds to DNA, inducing differentiation of cells derived from the [[gonadal ridge|genital ridges]] into testes. In transgenic XX mice (and some human [[XX male syndrome|XX male]]s), ''SRY'' alone is sufficient to induce male differentiation.

==Humans==
{{main|Sexual differentiation in humans}}
{{Further |Defeminization}}
[[File:YChromShowingSRY2.png|thumb|200px|The Human Y Chromosome showing the SRY gene which codes for a protein regulating sexual differentiation.]]
Various processes are involved in the development of [[sex differences in humans]]. Sexual differentiation in humans includes development of different genitalia and the internal genital tracts, breasts, body hair, and plays a role in gender identification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gfmer.ch/Books/Reproductive_health/Human_sexual_differentiation.html{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of sexual differences begins with the [[XY sex-determination system]] that is present in humans, and complex mechanisms are responsible for the development of the phenotypic differences between [[male]] and [[female]] [[human]]s from an undifferentiated [[zygote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01726695 |title=Determination of sex chromosomal constitution and chromosomal origin of drumsticks, drumstick-like structures, and other nuclear bodies in human blood cells at interphase by fluorescence in situ hybridization |year=1990 |last1=Mukherjee |first1=Asit B. |last2=Parsa |first2=Nasser Z. |journal=Chromosoma |volume=99 |issue=6 |pages=432–5 |pmid=2176962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atypical sexual development, and ambiguous genitalia, can be a result of genetic and hormonal factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16160410 |year=2005 |last1=Kučinskas |first1=Laimutis |last2=Just |first2=Walter |title=Human male sex determination and sexual differentiation: Pathways, molecular interactions and genetic disorders |volume=41 |issue=8 |pages=633–40 |journal=Medicina |url=http://medicina.kmu.lt/0508/0508-01e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differentiation of other parts of the body than the [[sex organ]] creates the [[secondary sex characteristic]]s. Sexual dimorphism of skeletal structure develops during childhood, and becomes more pronounced at adolescence.  Sexual orientation has been demonstrated to correlate with skeletal characters that become dimorphic during early childhood (such as arm length to stature ratio) but not with characters that become dimorphic during puberty—such as shoulder width.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2003.07.003 |ref=harv |title=Anthropometric analysis of homosexuals and heterosexuals: Implications for early hormone exposure |year=2004 |last1=Martin |first1=James T |last2=Nguyen |first2=Duc Huu |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=45 |pages=31–9 |pmid=14733889 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humans and other animals==

===Brain differentiation===
{{Main|Neuroscience of sex differences}}

In most animals, differences of exposure of a fetal or infant [[brain]] to sex hormones produce significant differences of brain structure and function which correlate with adult reproductive behavior.

Sex hormone levels in human male and female fetuses and infants also differ, and both [[androgen receptors]] and [[estrogen receptors]] have been identified in brains. Several sex-specific genes not dependent on sex steroids are expressed differently in male and female human brains. Structural sex differences begin to be recognizable by 2 years of age, and in adult men and women include size and shape of [[corpus callosum]] (larger in women) and [[Nerve fascicle|fasciculae]] connecting each hemisphere internally (larger in men), certain [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] nuclei, and the [[gonadotropin]] feedback response to [[estradiol]].{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The absence of the genes that generate male genitalia do not single-handedly lead to a female brain.  The male brain requires more hormones, such as testosterone, in order to properly differentiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siiteri|first=PK|author2=Wilson, JD |title=Testosterone formation and metabolism during male sexual differentiation in the human embryo.|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism|date=Jan 1974|volume=38|issue=1|pages=113–25|pmid=4809636|doi=10.1210/jcem-38-1-113}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hormones are released due to a gene expressed during embryonic development.

The '''Smith chart''', invented by  [[Phillip Hagar Smith|Phillip H. Smith]] (1905–1987),&lt;ref&gt;Smith, P. H.; Transmission Line Calculator; Electronics, Vol. 12, No. 1, pp 29-31, January 1939&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, P. H.; An Improved Transmission Line Calculator; Electronics, Vol. 17, No. 1, p 130, January 1944&lt;/ref&gt; is a graphical aid or [[nomogram]] designed for [[electrical engineering|electrical and electronics engineers]] specializing in [[radio frequency]] (RF) engineering to assist in solving problems with [[transmission line]]s and [[impedance matching|matching]] circuits.&lt;ref&gt;Ramo, Whinnery and Van Duzer (1965); "Fields and Waves in Communications Electronics"; John Wiley &amp; Sons; pp 35-39. ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; The Smith chart can be used to simultaneously display multiple parameters including [[electrical impedance|impedances]], [[admittance]]s, [[reflection coefficient]]s, &lt;math&gt;S_{nn}\,&lt;/math&gt; [[scattering parameters]], [[noise figure]] circles, constant gain contours and regions for [[stability theory|unconditional stability]], including mechanical [[vibration]]s analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Pozar, David M. (2005); ''Microwave Engineering, Third Edition'' (Intl. Ed.); John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.; pp 64-71. {{ISBN|0-471-44878-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, Guillermo (1997); ''Microwave Transistor Amplifiers Analysis and Design, Second Edition''; Prentice Hall NJ; pp 93-103. {{ISBN|0-13-254335-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Smith chart is most frequently used at or within the [[1 (number)|unity]] [[radius]] region. However, the remainder is still mathematically relevant, being used, for example, in [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]] design and [[stability theory|stability]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, Guillermo (1997) (op. cit);pp 98-101&lt;/ref&gt;

While the use of paper Smith charts for solving the complex mathematics involved in matching problems has been largely replaced by software based methods, the Smith chart display is still the preferred method of displaying how RF parameters behave at one or more frequencies, an alternative to using [[table (information)|tabular]] information. 
Thus most RF circuit analysis software includes a Smith chart option for the display of results and all but the simplest impedance measuring instruments can display measured results on a Smith chart display.

[[Image:Smith chart gen.svg|thumbnail|250px|An impedance Smith chart (with no data plotted)]]

==Overview==
[[Image:NetworkAnalyzer.jpg|400px|thumb|A [[Network analyzer (electrical)|network analyzer]] ([[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] 8720A) showing a Smith chart.]]
The Smith chart is plotted on the [[complex number|complex]] [[reflection coefficient]] plane in [[dimension|two dimensions]] and is scaled in normalised [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] (the most common), normalised [[admittance]] or both, using different colours to distinguish between them. These are often known as the Z, Y and YZ Smith charts respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, Guillermo (1997) (op. cit);p 97&lt;/ref&gt; Normalised scaling allows the Smith chart to be used for problems involving any [[characteristic impedance|characteristic]] or system impedance which is represented by the center point of the chart. The most commonly used normalization impedance is 50 [[ohm]]s. Once an answer is obtained through the graphical constructions described below, it is straightforward to convert between normalised impedance (or normalised admittance) and the corresponding unnormalized value by multiplying by the characteristic impedance (admittance). Reflection coefficients can be read directly from the chart as they are unitless parameters.

The Smith chart has [[circumference|circumferential]] scaling in [[wavelengths]] and [[degree (angle)|degree]]s. The wavelengths scale is used in [[distributed element model|distributed component]] problems and represents the distance measured along the transmission line connected between the [[signal generator|generator]] or source and the load to the point under consideration. The degrees scale represents the angle of the voltage reflection coefficient at that point. The Smith chart may also be used for [[lumped element model|lumped element]] matching and analysis problems.

Use of the Smith chart and the interpretation of the results obtained using it requires a good understanding of [[alternating current|AC circuit theory]] and transmission line theory, both of which are pre-requisites for RF engineers.

As impedances and admittances change with frequency, problems using the Smith chart can only be solved manually using one [[frequency]] at a time, the result being represented by a [[point (geometry)|point]]. This is often adequate for [[frequency range|narrow band]] applications (typically up to about 5% to 10% [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]) but for wider bandwidths it is usually necessary to apply Smith chart techniques at more than one frequency across the operating frequency band. Provided the frequencies are sufficiently close, the resulting Smith chart points may be joined by straight lines to create a [[locus (mathematics)|locus]].

A locus of points on a Smith chart covering a range of frequencies can be used to visually represent:
*how [[capacitance|capacitive]] or how [[inductance|inductive]] a load is across the frequency range
*how difficult matching is likely to be at various frequencies
*how well matched a particular component is.

The accuracy of the Smith chart is reduced for problems involving a large locus of impedances or admittances, although the scaling can be magnified for individual areas to accommodate these.

==Mathematical basis==
[[File:Smith chart explanation.svg|thumb|500px|right|Most basic use of an impedance Smith chart. A wave travels down a [[transmission line]] of [[characteristic impedance]] ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, terminated at a load with [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and normalised impedance {{nowrap|1=''z''=''Z''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. There is a [[signal reflection]] with coefficient Γ. Each point on the Smith chart simultaneously represents both a value of ''z'' (bottom left), and the corresponding value of Γ (bottom right), related by {{nowrap|1=''z''=(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Γ)/(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;Γ).}}]]

===Actual and normalised impedance and admittance===
A transmission line with a characteristic impedance of &lt;math&gt;Z_0\,&lt;/math&gt; may be universally considered to have a [[characteristic admittance]] of &lt;math&gt;Y_0\,&lt;/math&gt; where
:&lt;math&gt;Y_0 = \frac{1}{Z_0}\,&lt;/math&gt;
Any impedance, &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{T}\,&lt;/math&gt; expressed in ohms, may be normalised by dividing it by the characteristic impedance, so the normalised impedance using the lower case ''z''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{T} = \frac{Z_\text{T}}{Z_0}\,&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, for normalised admittance
:&lt;math&gt;y_\text{T} = \frac{Y_\text{T}}{Y_0}\,&lt;/math&gt;
The [[International system of units|SI unit]] of [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is the [[ohm]] with the symbol of the upper case [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[omega]] (Ω) and the [[SI unit]] for [[admittance]] is the [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] with the symbol of an upper case letter S. Normalised impedance and normalised admittance are [[dimensionless]]. Actual impedances and admittances must be normalised before using them on a Smith chart. Once the result is obtained it may be de-normalised to obtain the actual result.

===The normalised impedance Smith chart===
[[File:Transmission_line_pulse_reflections.gif|thumb|right|300px|Transmission lines terminated by an open circuit (top) and a short circuit (bottom). A pulse reflects perfectly off both these terminations, but the sign of the reflected voltage is opposite in the two cases. Black dots represent electrons, and arrows show the electric field.]]
Using transmission line theory, if a transmission line is [[Electrical termination|terminated]] in an impedance (&lt;math&gt;Z_\text{T}\,&lt;/math&gt;) which differs from its characteristic impedance (&lt;math&gt;Z_0\,&lt;/math&gt;), a [[standing wave]] will be formed on the line comprising the [[resultant]] of both the incident or '''f'''orward (&lt;math&gt;V_\text{F}\,&lt;/math&gt;) and the '''r'''eflected or reversed (&lt;math&gt;V_\text{R}\,&lt;/math&gt;) waves. Using [[complex number|complex]] [[exponential function|exponential]] notation:
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{F} = A \exp(j \omega t)\exp(+\gamma \ell)~\,&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{R} = B \exp(j \omega t)\exp(-\gamma \ell)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where

:&lt;math&gt;\exp(j \omega t)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[time|temporal]] part of the wave
:&lt;math&gt;\exp(\pm\gamma \ell)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the spatial part of the wave and
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = 2 \pi f\,&lt;/math&gt; where
:&lt;math&gt;\omega\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] in [[radian]]s per [[second]] (rad/s)
:&lt;math&gt;f\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[frequency]] in [[hertz]] (Hz)
:&lt;math&gt;t\,&lt;/math&gt; is the time in seconds (s)
:&lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt; are [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]]s
:&lt;math&gt;\ell\,&lt;/math&gt; is the distance measured along the transmission line from the load toward the generator in metres (m)
Also
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \alpha + j \beta\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[propagation constant]] which has units 1/m
where
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[attenuation constant]] in [[neper]]s per metre (Np/m)
:&lt;math&gt;\beta\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[phase constant]] in [[radian]]s per metre (rad/m)
The Smith chart is used with one frequency (&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;) at a time, and only for one moment (&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;) at a time, so the temporal part of the phase (&lt;math&gt;\exp(j \omega t)\,&lt;/math&gt;) is fixed. All terms are actually multiplied by this to obtain the [[instantaneous phase]], but it is conventional and understood to omit it. Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{F} = A \exp(+\gamma \ell)\,&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{R} = B \exp(-\gamma \ell)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the forward and reverse voltage amplitudes at the load.

====The variation of complex reflection coefficient with position along the line====
[[File:SmithChartLineLength.svg|thumb|right|500px|Looking towards a load through a length &lt;math&gt;\ell\,&lt;/math&gt; of lossless transmission line, the impedance changes as &lt;math&gt;\ell\,&lt;/math&gt; increases, following the blue circle. (This impedance is characterized by its reflection coefficient &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{reflected}}/V_{\text{incident}}&lt;/math&gt;.) The blue circle, centered within the impedance Smith chart, is sometimes called an ''SWR circle'' (short for ''constant [[standing wave ratio]]'').]]
The complex voltage reflection coefficient &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the ratio of the reflected wave to the incident (or forward) wave. Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \frac{V_\text{R}}{V_\text{F}} = \frac{B \exp(-\gamma \ell)}{A \exp(+\gamma \ell)} = C \exp(-2 \gamma \ell)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''C''}} is also a constant.

For a uniform transmission line (in which &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,&lt;/math&gt; is constant), the complex reflection coefficient of a standing wave varies according to the position on the line. If the line is [[attenuation (electronics)|lossy]] (&lt;math&gt;\alpha\,&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero) this is represented on the Smith chart by a [[spiral]] path. In most Smith chart problems however, losses can be assumed negligible (&lt;math&gt;\alpha = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;) and the task of solving them is greatly simplified. For the loss free case therefore, the expression for complex reflection coefficient becomes 
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \Gamma_\text{L} \exp(-2 j \beta \ell)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_\text{L}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the reflection coefficient at the load, and &lt;math&gt;\ell\,&lt;/math&gt; is the line length from the load to the location where the reflection coefficient is measured. The phase constant &lt;math&gt;\beta\,&lt;/math&gt; may also be written as 
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength ''within the transmission line'' at the test frequency.

Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \Gamma_\text{L} \exp\left(\frac{-4 j \pi}{\lambda}\ell\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
This equation shows that, for a standing wave, the complex reflection coefficient and impedance repeats every half wavelength along the transmission line. The complex reflection coefficient is generally simply referred to as reflection coefficient. The outer circumferential scale of the Smith chart represents the distance from the generator to the load scaled in wavelengths and is therefore scaled from zero to 0.50&amp;nbsp;.

====The variation of normalised impedance with position along the line====
If &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I\,&lt;/math&gt; are the voltage across and the current entering the termination at the end of the transmission line respectively, then
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{F} + V_\text{R} = V\,&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{F} - V_\text{R} = Z_0 I\,&lt;/math&gt;.
By dividing these equations and substituting for both the voltage reflection coefficient
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma=\frac{V_\text{R}}{V_\text{F}}\,&lt;/math&gt;
and the normalised impedance of the termination represented by the lower case ''z'', subscript T
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{T}=\frac{V}{Z_0 I}\,&lt;/math&gt;
gives the result:
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{T}=\frac{1+\Gamma}{1-\Gamma}\,&lt;/math&gt;.
Alternatively, in terms of the reflection coefficient
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma=\frac{z_\text{T} - 1}{z_\text{T} + 1}\,&lt;/math&gt;
These are the equations which are used to construct the ''Z'' Smith chart. Mathematically speaking &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_\text{T}\, &lt;/math&gt; are related via a [[Möbius transformation]].

Both &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_\text{T}\,&lt;/math&gt; are expressed in [[complex numbers]] without any units. They both change with frequency so for any particular measurement, the frequency at which it was performed must be stated together with the characteristic impedance.

&lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,&lt;/math&gt; may be expressed in [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[angle]] on a [[complex plane|polar diagram]]. Any actual reflection coefficient must have a magnitude of less than or equal to [[1 (number)|unity]] so, at the test frequency, this may be expressed by a point inside a circle of unity radius. The Smith chart is actually constructed on such a polar diagram. The Smith chart scaling is designed in such a way that reflection coefficient can be converted to normalised impedance or vice versa. Using the Smith chart, the normalised impedance may be obtained with appreciable accuracy by plotting the point representing the reflection coefficient ''treating the Smith chart as a polar diagram'' and then reading its value directly using the characteristic Smith chart scaling. This technique is a graphical alternative to substituting the values in the equations.

By substituting the expression for how reflection coefficient changes along an unmatched loss free transmission line
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \frac{B \exp(-\gamma \ell)}{A \exp(\gamma \ell)} =\frac{B \exp(-j \beta \ell)}{A \exp(j \beta \ell)}\,&lt;/math&gt;
for the loss free case, into the equation for normalised impedance in terms of reflection coefficient
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{T}=\frac{1 + \Gamma}{1 - \Gamma}\,&lt;/math&gt;.
and using [[Euler's formula]]
:&lt;math&gt;\exp(j\theta) = \cos \theta + j \sin \theta\,&lt;/math&gt;
yields the impedance version transmission line equation for the loss free case:&lt;ref&gt;Hayt, William H Jr.; "Engineering Electromagnetics" Fourth Ed; McGraw-Hill International Book Company; pp 428–433. {{ISBN|0-07-027395-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;Z_\text{in} = Z_0 \frac{Z_\text{L} + j Z_0 \tan (\beta \ell)}{Z_0 + j Z_\text{L} \tan (\beta \ell)}\,&lt;/math&gt;
where
&lt;math&gt;Z_\text{in}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the impedance 'seen' at the input of a loss free transmission line of length &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, terminated with an impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{L}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Versions of the transmission line equation may be similarly derived for the admittance loss free case and for the impedance and admittance lossy cases.

The Smith chart graphical equivalent of using the transmission line equation is to normalise &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{L}\,&lt;/math&gt;, to plot the resulting point on a ''Z'' Smith chart and to draw a circle through that point centred at the Smith chart centre. The path along the arc of the circle represents how the impedance changes whilst moving along the transmission line. In this case the circumferential (wavelength) scaling must be used, remembering that this is the wavelength within the transmission line and may differ from the free space wavelength.

====Regions of the ''Z'' Smith chart====
If a polar diagram is mapped on to a [[cartesian coordinate system]] it is conventional to measure angles relative to the positive ''x''-axis using a [[counterclockwise]] direction for positive angles. The magnitude of a complex number is the length of a straight line drawn from the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] to the point representing it. The Smith chart uses the same convention, noting that, in the normalised impedance plane, the positive x-axis extends from the center of the Smith chart at &lt;math&gt;z_\text{T} = 1 \pm j 0\,&lt;/math&gt; to the point &lt;math&gt;z_\text{T} = \infty \pm j \infty\,&lt;/math&gt;. The region above the x-axis represents inductive impedances (positive imaginary parts) and the region below the {{math|''x''}}-axis represents capacitive impedances (negative imaginary parts).

If the termination is perfectly matched, the reflection coefficient will be zero, represented effectively by a circle of zero radius or in fact a point at the centre of the Smith chart. If the termination was a perfect open circuit or [[short circuit]] the magnitude of the reflection coefficient would be unity, all power would be reflected and the point would lie at some point on the unity circumference circle.

====Circles of constant normalised resistance and constant normalised reactance====
The normalised impedance Smith chart is composed of two families of circles: circles of constant normalised resistance and circles of constant normalised reactance. In the complex reflection coefficient plane the Smith chart occupies a circle of unity radius centred at the origin. In cartesian coordinates therefore the circle would pass through the points (+1,0) and (&amp;minus;1,0) on the ''x''-axis and the points (0,+1) and (0,&amp;minus;1) on the ''y''-axis.

Since both &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z\,&lt;/math&gt; are complex numbers, in general they may be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;z = a + j b\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = c + j d\,&lt;/math&gt;

with ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' real numbers.

Substituting these into the equation relating normalised impedance and complex reflection coefficient:
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma=\frac{z - 1}{z + 1}\,&lt;/math&gt;
gives the following result:
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = c + j d = \left[\frac{a^2 + b^2 - 1}{(a + 1)^2 + b^2}\right] + j \left[\frac{2b}{(a + 1)^2 + b^2}\right]\,&lt;/math&gt;.
This is the equation which describes how the complex reflection coefficient changes with the normalised impedance and may be used to construct both families of circles.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, C. W.;"Transmission Lines for Communications with CAD Programs";Macmillan; pp 80-85. {{ISBN|0-333-47398-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Y'' Smith chart===
The ''Y'' Smith chart is constructed in a similar way to the ''Z'' Smith chart case but by expressing values of voltage reflection coefficient in terms of normalised admittance instead of normalised impedance. The normalised admittance ''y''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is the reciprocal of the normalised impedance ''z''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, so
:&lt;math&gt;y_\text{T}=\frac{1}{z_\text{T}}\,&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore:
:&lt;math&gt;y_\text{T} = \frac{1-\Gamma}{1+\Gamma}\,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \frac{ 1 - y_\text{T} }{ 1 + y_\text{T} }\,&lt;/math&gt;
The ''Y'' Smith chart appears like the normalised impedance type but with the graphic scaling rotated through 180°, the numeric scaling remaining unchanged.

The region above the ''x''-axis represents capacitive admittances and the region below the ''x''-axis represents inductive admittances. Capacitive admittances have positive [[Imaginary number|imaginary]] parts and inductive admittances have negative imaginary parts.

Again, if the termination is perfectly matched the reflection coefficient will be zero, represented by a 'circle' of zero radius or in fact a point at the centre of the Smith chart. If the termination was a perfect open or short circuit the magnitude of the voltage reflection coefficient would be unity, all power would be reflected and the point would lie at some point on the unity circumference circle of the Smith chart.

===Practical examples===
[[Image:SmithEx2.png|thumbnail|Example points plotted on the normalised impedance Smith chart]]
A point with a reflection coefficient magnitude 0.63 and angle 60° represented in polar form as &lt;math&gt;0.63\angle60^\circ\,&lt;/math&gt;, is shown as point P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the Smith chart. To plot this, one may use the circumferential (reflection coefficient) angle scale to find the &lt;math&gt;\angle60^\circ\,&lt;/math&gt; graduation and a ruler to draw a line passing through this and the centre of the Smith chart. The length of the line would then be scaled to P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; assuming the Smith chart radius to be unity. For example, if the actual radius measured from the paper was 100&amp;nbsp;mm, the length OP&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; would be 63&amp;nbsp;mm.

The following table gives some similar examples of points which are plotted on the ''Z'' Smith chart. For each, the reflection coefficient is given in polar form together with the corresponding normalised impedance in rectangular form. The conversion may be read directly from the Smith chart or by substitution into the equation.

===Working with both the ''Z'' Smith chart and the ''Y'' Smith charts===
In RF circuit and matching problems sometimes it is more convenient to work with admittances (representing [[electrical conductance|conductances]] and [[susceptance]]s) and sometimes it is more convenient to work with impedances (representing [[Electrical resistance|resistances]] and [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]]s). Solving a typical matching problem will often require several changes between both types of Smith chart, using normalised impedance for [[series and parallel circuits|series]] elements and normalised admittances for [[series and parallel circuits|parallel]] elements. For these a dual (normalised) impedance and admittance Smith chart may be used. Alternatively, one type may be used and the scaling converted to the other when required. In order to change from normalised impedance to normalised admittance or vice versa, the point representing the value of reflection coefficient under consideration is moved through exactly 180 degrees at the same radius. For example, the point P1 in the example representing a reflection coefficient of &lt;math&gt;0.63\angle60^\circ\,&lt;/math&gt; has a normalised impedance of &lt;math&gt; z_P = 0.80 + j1.40\,&lt;/math&gt;. To graphically change this to the equivalent normalised admittance point, say Q1, a line is drawn with a ruler from P1 through the Smith chart centre to Q1, an equal radius in the opposite direction. This is equivalent to moving the point through a circular path of exactly 180 degrees. Reading the value from the Smith chart for Q1, remembering that the scaling is now in normalised admittance,  gives &lt;math&gt;y_P = 0.30 - j0.54\,&lt;/math&gt;. Performing the calculation
:&lt;math&gt;y_\text{T} = \frac{1}{ z_\text{T} }\,&lt;/math&gt;
manually will confirm this.

Once a [[transformation (mathematics)|transformation]] from impedance to admittance has been performed, the scaling changes to normalised admittance until a later transformation back to normalised impedance is performed.

The table below shows examples of normalised impedances and their equivalent normalised admittances obtained by rotation of the point through 180°. Again, these may be obtained either by calculation or using a Smith chart as shown, converting between the normalised impedance and normalised admittances planes.

|}
[[Image:SmithEx3.png|thumbnail|Values of complex reflection coefficient plotted on the normalised impedance Smith chart and their equivalents on the normalised admittance Smith chart]]

===Choice of Smith chart type and component type===
The choice of whether to use the ''Z'' Smith chart or the ''Y'' Smith chart for any particular calculation depends on which is more convenient. Impedances in series and admittances in parallel add while impedances in parallel and admittances in series are related by a reciprocal equation. If &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{TS} &lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent impedance of series impedances and &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{TP} &lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent impedance of parallel impedances, then
:&lt;math&gt;Z_\text{TS} = Z_1 + Z_2 + Z_3 + ... \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Z_\text{TP}} = \frac{1}{Z_1} + \frac{1}{Z_2} + \frac{1}{Z_3} + ... \,&lt;/math&gt;
For admittances the reverse is true, that is
:&lt;math&gt;Y_\text{TP} = Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3 + ... \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Y_\text{TS}} = \frac{1}{Y_1} + \frac{1}{Y_2} + \frac{1}{Y_3} + ... \,&lt;/math&gt;
Dealing with the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]], especially in complex numbers, is more time consuming and error-prone than using linear addition. In general therefore, most [[Radio frequency|RF]] engineers work in the plane where the [[circuit topography]] supports linear addition. The following table gives the complex expressions for impedance (real and normalised) and admittance (real and normalised) for each of the three basic [[passive components|passive circuit elements]]: resistance, inductance and capacitance. Using just the characteristic impedance (or characteristic admittance) and test frequency an [[equivalent circuit]] can be found and vice versa.

==Using the Smith chart to solve conjugate matching problems with distributed components==
Distributed matching becomes feasible and is sometimes required when the physical size of the matching components is more than about 5% of a wavelength at the operating frequency. Here the electrical behaviour of many lumped components becomes rather unpredictable. This occurs in microwave circuits and when high power requires large components in shortwave, FM and TV Broadcasting,

For distributed components the effects on reflection coefficient and impedance of moving along the transmission line must be allowed for using the outer circumferential scale of the Smith chart which is calibrated in wavelengths.

The following example shows how a transmission line, terminated with an arbitrary load, may be matched at one frequency either with a series or parallel reactive component in each case connected at precise positions.

[[Image:SmithEx4.png|thumbnail|Smith chart construction for some distributed transmission line matching]]
Supposing a loss-free air-spaced transmission line of characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_0 = 50 \ \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, operating at a frequency of 800&amp;nbsp;MHz, is terminated with a circuit comprising a 17.5 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; resistor in series with a 6.5 nanohenry (6.5 nH) inductor. How may the line be matched?

From the table above, the reactance of the inductor forming part of the termination at 800&amp;nbsp;MHz is
:&lt;math&gt;Z_L = j \omega L = j 2 \pi f L = j32.7 \ \Omega\,&lt;/math&gt;
so the impedance of the combination (&lt;math&gt;Z_T&lt;/math&gt;) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;Z_T = 17.5 + j32.7 \ \Omega\,&lt;/math&gt;
and the normalised impedance (&lt;math&gt;z_T&lt;/math&gt;) is
:&lt;math&gt;z_T = \frac{Z_T}{Z_0} = 0.35 + j0.65\,&lt;/math&gt;
This is plotted on the Z Smith chart at point P&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;. The line OP&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; is extended through to the wavelength scale where it intersects at the point &lt;math&gt;L_1 = 0.098 \lambda\,&lt;/math&gt;. As the transmission line is loss free, a circle centred at the centre of the Smith chart is drawn through the point P&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; to represent the path of the constant magnitude reflection coefficient due to the termination. At point P&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; the circle intersects with the unity circle of constant normalised resistance at 
:&lt;math&gt;z_{P21} = 1.00 + j1.52\,&lt;/math&gt;.
The extension of the line OP&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; intersects the wavelength scale at &lt;math&gt;L_2 = 0.177 \lambda\,&lt;/math&gt;, therefore the distance from the termination to this point on the line is given by
:&lt;math&gt;L_2 - L_1  = 0.177\lambda - 0.098\lambda = 0.079\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt;
Since the transmission line is air-spaced, the wavelength at 800&amp;nbsp;MHz in the line is the same as that in free space and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{c}{f}\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c\,&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of [[speed of light|electromagnetic radiation in free space]] and &lt;math&gt;f\,&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency in hertz. The result gives &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 375 \ \mathrm{mm}\,&lt;/math&gt;, making the position of the matching component 29.6&amp;nbsp;mm from the load.

The conjugate match for the impedance at P&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;math&gt;z_{match}\,&lt;/math&gt;) is 
:&lt;math&gt;z_{match} = - j (1.52),\!&lt;/math&gt;
As the Smith chart is still in the normalised impedance plane, from the table above a series capacitor &lt;math&gt;C_m\,&lt;/math&gt; is required where
:&lt;math&gt;z_{match} = - j 1.52 = \frac{-j}{\omega C_m Z_0} = \frac{-j}{2 \pi f C_m Z_0}\,&lt;/math&gt;
Rearranging, we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;C_m=\frac{1}{(1.52) \omega Z_0} = \frac{1}{(1.52)(2 \pi f) Z_0}&lt;/math&gt;.
Substitution of known values gives
:&lt;math&gt;C_m = 2.6 \ \mathrm{pF}\,&lt;/math&gt;
To match the termination at 800&amp;nbsp;MHz, a series capacitor of 2.6 pF must be placed in series with the transmission line at a distance of 29.6&amp;nbsp;mm from the termination.

An alternative shunt match could be calculated after performing a Smith chart transformation from normalised impedance to normalised admittance. Point Q&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; is the equivalent of P&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; but expressed as a normalised admittance. Reading from the Smith chart scaling, remembering that this is now a normalised admittance gives
:&lt;math&gt;y_{Q20} = 0.65 - j1.20\,&lt;/math&gt;
(In fact this value is not actually used). However, the extension of the line OQ&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; through to the wavelength scale gives &lt;math&gt;L_3 = 0.152 \lambda\,&lt;/math&gt;. The earliest point at which a shunt conjugate match could be introduced, moving towards the generator, would be at Q&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;, the same position as the previous P&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;, but this time representing a normalised admittance given by 
:&lt;math&gt;y_{Q21} = 1.00 + j1.52\,&lt;/math&gt;.
The distance along the transmission line is in this case 
:&lt;math&gt;L_2 + L_3  = 0.177\lambda + 0.152\lambda = 0.329\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt;
which converts to 123&amp;nbsp;mm.

The conjugate matching component is required to have a normalised admittance (&lt;math&gt;y_{match}&lt;/math&gt;) of
:&lt;math&gt;y_{match} = - j1.52\,&lt;/math&gt;.
From the table it can be seen that a negative admittance would require an inductor, connected in parallel with the transmission line. If its value is &lt;math&gt;L_m\,&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;-j1.52 = \frac{-j}{\omega L_m Y_0}= \frac{-jZ_0}{2\pi f L_m}\,&lt;/math&gt;
This gives the result 
:&lt;math&gt;L_m = 6.5 \ \mathrm{nH}\,&lt;/math&gt;
A suitable inductive shunt matching would therefore be a 6.5 nH inductor in parallel with the line positioned at 123&amp;nbsp;mm from the load.

==Using the Smith chart to analyze lumped element circuits==
The analysis of lumped element components assumes that the wavelength at the frequency of operation is much greater than the dimensions of the components themselves. The Smith chart may be used to analyze such circuits in which case the movements around the chart are generated by the (normalized) impedances and admittances of the components at the frequency of operation. In this case the wavelength scaling on the Smith chart circumference is not used. The following circuit will be analyzed using a Smith chart at an operating frequency of 100&amp;nbsp;MHz. At this frequency the free space wavelength is 3 m. The component dimensions themselves will be in the order of millimetres so the assumption of lumped components will be valid. Despite there being no transmission line as such, a system impedance must still be defined to enable normalization and de-normalization calculations and &lt;math&gt;Z_0 = 50 \ \Omega\,&lt;/math&gt; is a good choice here as &lt;math&gt;R_1 = 50 \ \Omega\,&lt;/math&gt;. If there were very different values of resistance present a value closer to these might be a better choice.

[[Image:SmithCctEx1.png|thumbnail|A lumped element circuit which may be analysed using a Smith chart]]
[[Image:SmithEx5.png|thumbnail|Smith chart with graphical construction for analysis of a lumped circuit]]
The analysis starts with a Z Smith chart looking into R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; only with no other components present. As &lt;math&gt;R_1 = 50 \ \Omega\,&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the system impedance, this is represented by a point at the centre of the Smith chart. The first transformation is OP&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; along the line of constant normalized resistance in this case the addition of a normalized reactance of -''j''0.80, corresponding to a series capacitor of 40 pF. Points with suffix P are in the ''Z'' plane and points with suffix Q are in the ''Y'' plane. Therefore, transformations ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are from the Z Smith chart to the Y Smith chart and transformation ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is from the Y Smith chart to the Z Smith chart. The following table shows the steps taken to work through the remaining components and transformations, returning eventually back to the centre of the Smith chart and a perfect 50 ohm match.

==3D Smith chart==
[[File:3D Smith Chart representation.jpg|thumb|100px|alt=3D Smith chart representation.|3D Smith chart representation]]
A generalized 3D Smith chart based on the extended complex plane ([[Riemann sphere]]) and [[inversive geometry]] was proposed in 2011. The chart unifies the passive and active circuit design on little and big circles on the surface of a unit sphere using the stereographic [[conformal map]] of the reflection coefficient's generalized plane. Considering the point at infinity, the space of the new chart includes all possible loads. The north pole is the perfect matching point, while the south pole is the perfect mismatch point.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Muller, Pablo Soto, D. Dascalu, D. Neculoiu, V.E.

A '''standard language''' or '''standard variety''' is either as a language [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] used by a population for public purposes, or a variety that has undergone standardization.{{sfn|Finegan|2007|p=14}}
Typically, varieties that become standardized are the local [[dialect]]s spoken in the centers of [[commerce]] and [[government]], where a need arises for a variety that will serve more than local needs.
Standardization typically involves a fixed orthography, codification in authoritative grammars and dictionaries and public acceptance of these standards.
A standard [[written language]] is sometimes termed by the [[German language|German]] word ''Schriftsprache''.

A [[pluricentric language]] has multiple interacting standard varieties.{{sfn|Stewart|1968|p=534}}{{sfn|Kloss|1967|p=31}}{{sfn|Clyne|1992|p=1}}
Examples include [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]],  [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].{{sfn|Clyne|1992|pp=1–3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Madelain |editor1-first=Anne |title=Au sud de l'Est |series=vol. 3 |publisher=Non Lieu |pages=71–78 |language=French |chapter=La langue croate, serbe, bosniaque et monténégrine |trans-chapter=Croatian, Serbian, Bosniakian, and Montenegrin |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |deadurl=no |location=Paris |year=2007 |isbn=978-2-35270-036-4 |oclc=182916790 |archivedate=4 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69f5WqGAx?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |accessdate=8 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Monocentric languages, such as [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], have only one standardized version.{{sfn|Clyne|1992|p=3}}

== Standardization ==

A standard variety is developed from a group of related varieties.
This may be done by elevating a single variety, such as the local variety of a center of government or culture.
Alternatively, a new variety may be defined as a selection of features from existing varieties.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=275}}
A fixed orthography is typically created for writing the variety.
It may be codified in normative [[dictionaries]] and [[linguistic description|grammar]]s, or by an agreed collection of exemplary texts.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=275}}
Whether these dictionaries and grammars are created by private individuals (like ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'') or by state institutions, they become standard if they are treated as authorities for correcting language.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=276}}
A fixed written form and subsequent codification make the standard variety more stable than purely spoken varieties, and provide a base for further development or ''[[ausbau]]''.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=275}}
This variety becomes the norm for writing, is used in broadcasting and for official purposes, and is the form taught to non-native learners.{{sfn|Trudgill|2006|p=119}}

Through this process, the standard variety acquires [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] and a greater functional importance than local varieties.{{sfn|Trudgill|2006|p=119}}
Those varieties are said to be dependent on, or [[autonomy and heteronomy (sociolinguistics)|heteronomous]] with respect to, the standard variety, because speakers read and write the standard, refer to it as an authority is such matters as specialist vocabulary, and any standardizing changes in their speech are towards that standard.{{sfn|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=9}}
In some cases, such as [[Standard English]], this process may take place over an extended period without government intervention.
In others it may be deliberately directed by official institutions, such as the [[Académie française]] or [[Royal Spanish Academy|Real Academia Española]], and can proceed much more quickly.{{sfn|Trudgill|2006|p=119}}

Language standardization is often linked to the formation, or attempted formation, of [[nation states]], as language is seen as the vehicle of a shared culture.{{sfn|Inoue|2006|p=122}}
Different national standards derived from a [[dialect continuum]] may be regarded as different languages, even if they are [[mutually intelligible]].{{sfn|Stewart|1968}}{{sfn|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=11}}
The [[North Germanic language|Scandinavian languages]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], are often cited as examples.{{sfn|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|pp=3–4}}

In other cases governments or neighbouring populations may seek to deny a standard independent status.{{sfn|Inoue|2006|pp=123–124}}
In response, developers of a standard may base it on more divergent varieties.
Thus after [[Norway]] became independent at the start of the 20th century, the [[Bokmål]] standard based on the speech of [[Oslo]] was felt to be too similar to [[Danish language|Danish]] by [[Ivar Aasen]], who developed a rival [[Nynorsk]] standard based on western varieties.
Similarly, when a standard was developed in the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Yugoslav republic of Macedonia]] from local varieties within a continuum with [[Serbia]] to the north and [[Bulgaria]] to the east, it was deliberately based on varieties from the west of the republic that were most different from standard [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].
Now known as [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], it is the national standard of the independent [[Republic of Macedonia]], but viewed by Bulgarians as a dialect of Bulgarian.{{sfn|Trudgill|1992|pp=173–174}}

==Examples==
{{see also|List of language regulators}}

===Chinese===
[[Chinese language|Chinese]] consists of hundreds of [[varieties of Chinese|local varieties]], many of which are not mutually intelligible, usually classified into seven to ten major groups, including [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Yue Chinese|Yue]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Min Chinese|Min]].
Before the 20th century, most Chinese spoke only their local variety.
For two millennia, formal writing had been done in [[Literary Chinese]] (or Classical Chinese), a style modelled on the [[Chinese classics|classics]] and far removed from any contemporary speech.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=108–109, 245}}
As a practical measure, officials of the late imperial dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|common language based on Mandarin varieties]], known as ''Guānhuà'' (literally "speech of officials").{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=133, 136}}

In the early 20th century, many Chinese intellectuals argued that the country needed a standardized language.
By the 1920s, Literary Chinese had been replaced as the written standard by [[written vernacular Chinese]], which was based on Mandarin dialects.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=133–134}}
In the 1930s, [[Standard Chinese]] was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the [[Beijing dialect]], but with vocabulary also drawn from other Mandarin varieties and its syntax based on the written vernacular.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=135}}
It is the official spoken language of the [[People's Republic of China]] (where it is called ''Pǔtōnghuà''  "common speech") and of the [[Republic of China]] governing Taiwan (as ''Guóyǔ'' "national language"), and one of the official languages of [[Singapore]] (as ''Huáyǔ'' "Chinese language").{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=136–137}}
Standard Chinese now dominates public life, and is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=247}}

===Dutch===
Dutch is a [[Pluricentric language|monocentric language]], with all speakers using the same [[standardization|standard form]] (authorized by the [[Dutch Language Union]]) based on a [[Dutch orthography]] employing the [[Latin alphabet]] when writing. A process of standardisation of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] started in the [[Middle Ages]], especially under the influence of the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] Ducal Court in Dijon ([[Brussels]] after 1477). Till then every region spoke a different [[Middle Dutch]] dialect. The dialects of the [[County of Flanders]] and the [[Duchy of Brabant]] were the most influential around this time. The process of standardisation became much stronger at the start of the 16th century, mainly based on the urban dialect of [[Antwerp]]. In 1585 Antwerp [[Fall of Antwerp (1584–1585)|fell]] to the Spanish army: many from the [[Southern Netherlands]] fled to the [[Dutch Republic|Northern Netherlands]] (that [[Act of Abjuration|declared itself independent]] from Spain), especially to the [[County of Holland|province of Holland]], where they influenced the urban dialects. In 1637, a further important step was made towards a unified language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ccjk.com/dutch-full-historical-junk/ | title=Dutch &amp; Other Languages|publisher=Ccjk.com|accessdate=2015-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Statenvertaling]], the first major Bible translation into Dutch, was created that people from all over the new republic could understand. It used elements from various dialects but was predominantly based on the urban dialects of Holland of post 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taal.phileon.nl/brabants.php |title=Taal in Nederland .:. Brabants |publisher=Taal.phileon.nl |accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English===
In [[British English]] the standard, known as [[Standard English]] (SE), is historically based on the language of the medieval English [[court of Chancery]].{{sfn|Smith|1996}} The late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw the establishment of this standard as the norm of "polite" society, that is to say of the [[upper class]]es.{{sfn|Blake|1996}} The spoken standard has come to be seen as a mark of good education and social prestige.{{sfn|Baugh|Cable|2002}} Although often associated with the [[Received Pronunciation|RP accent]], SE can be spoken with any accent, such as [[General American]], [[General Australian]], etc.{{sfn|Smith|1996}}

===Greek===
The standard form of [[Modern Greek]] is based on the [[Varieties of Modern Greek#Spoken dialects|Southern dialects]]; these dialects are spoken mainly in the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Ionian Islands]], [[Attica]], [[Crete]] and the [[Cyclades]].&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks, Geoffrey (1997): ''Greek: A history of the language and its speakers.'' London: Longman. Ch.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindi-Urdu===
Two standardised [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of the [[Hindustani language]] have legal status India: [[Standard Hindi]] (one of 23 co-official national languages) and [[Urdu]] ([[Pakistan]]’s official tongue), resultantly, Hindustani often called “Hindi-Urdu".&lt;ref name=Blum&gt;{{cite book|last=Blum |first=Daniel|year=2002 |language=German |title=Sprache und Politik : Sprachpolitik und Sprachnationalismus in der Republik Indien und dem sozialistischen Jugoslawien (1945-1991) |trans-title=Language and Policy: Language Policy and Linguistic Nationalism in the Republic of India and the Socialist Yugoslavia (1945-1991) |series=Beiträge zur Südasienforschung ; vol. 192 |location=Würzburg | publisher=Ergon | page=200 |isbn=3-89913-253-X |oclc=51961066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish===
{{main article|An Caighdeán Oifigiúil}}

===Italian===
Standard [[Italian language|Italian]] is derived from the [[Tuscan dialect]], specifically from its [[Florentine dialect|Florentine variety]] &amp;mdash; the Florentine influence upon early [[Italian literature]] established that dialect as base for the standard language of Italy. In particular, Italian became the language of culture for all the people of Italy, thanks to the prestige of the masterpieces of [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Francesco Petrarca]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], and [[Francesco Guicciardini]]. It would later become the official language of all the [[Historical states of Italy|Italian states]], and after the [[Italian unification]] it became the [[national language]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/ling450ch/reports/Italian2.html A Brief History of the Italian Language by Cory Crawford]. linguistics.byu.edu&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[Italian language|Standard Italian]]'s lexicon has been deeply influenced by almost all [[Languages of Italy|regional languages of Italy]] while its [[received pronunciation]] (known as ''Pronuncia Fiorentina Emendata'', Amended Florentine Pronunciation) is based on the [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] of [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]] ([[Rome|Roman dialect]]); these are the reasons why Standard Italian differs significantly from the [[Tuscan dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/pronuncia_(Enciclopedia_dell'Italiano)/ La pronuncia italiana (Italian)]. treccani.it&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin===
[[Classical Latin]] was the literary standard dialect of Latin spoken by higher socioeconomic classes, as opposed to the [[Vulgar Latin]] which is the generic term of the colloquial [[sociolect]]s of Latin spoken across the [[Roman Empire]] by uneducated and less-educated classes. The Latin brought by Roman soldiers to [[Gaul]], [[Hispania|Iberia]], or [[Dacia]] was not identical to the Latin of [[Cicero]], and differed from it in vocabulary, syntax, and grammar.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;L. R. Palmer The Latin Language (repr. Univ. Oklahoma 1988, {{ISBN|0-8061-2136-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portuguese===

In Brazil, actors and journalists usually adopt an unofficial, but de facto, spoken standard [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], originally derived from the middle-class dialect of [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]], but that now encompasses educated urban pronunciations from the different speech communities in the southeast. In that standard, {{angbr|s}} represents the phoneme {{IPA|/s/}} when it appears at the end of a syllable (whereas in Rio de Janeiro this represents {{IPA|/ʃ/}}) the [[rhotic consonant]] spelled {{angbr|r}} is pronounced {{IPA|[h]}} in the same situation (whereas in [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]] this is usually an [[alveolar flap]] or [[alveolar trill|trill]]). European and African dialects have differing realizations of {{IPA|/ʁ/}} than Brazilian dialects, with the former using {{IPA|[ʁ]}} and {{IPA|[r]}} and the latter using {{IPA|[x]}}, {{IPA|[h]}}, or {{IPA|[χ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mateus, Maria Helena &amp; d'Andrade, Ernesto (2000) ''The Phonology of Portuguese'' {{ISBN|0-19-823581-X}} [http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-823581-X.pdf (Excerpt from Google Books)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628065105/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-823581-X.pdf |date=2007-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serbo-Croatian===
Four standard variants of the [[Pluricentric language#Serbo-Croatian|pluricentric Serbo-Croatian]] are spoken in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Madelain |editor1-first=Anne |title=Au sud de l'Est |series=vol. 3 |publisher=Non Lieu |pages=71–78 |language=French |chapter=La langue croate, serbe, bosniaque et monténégrine |trans-chapter=Croatian, Serbian, Bosniakian, and Montenegrin |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |deadurl=no |location=Paris |year=2007 |isbn=978-2-35270-036-4 |oclc=182916790 |archivedate=4 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69f5WqGAx?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |accessdate=8 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They all have the [[Language secessionism#In Serbo-Croatian|same dialect]] basis ([[Shtokavian dialect|Štokavian]]).&lt;ref name=Blum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brozović |first=Dalibor |authorlink=Dalibor Brozović |editor1-last=Clyne |editor1-first=Michael G |title=Pluricentric Languages: Differing Norms in Different Nations |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |pages=347–380 |chapter=Serbo-Croatian as a pluricentric language |chapterurl=https://books.google.hr/books?id=wawGFWNuHiwC&amp;pg=PA347&amp;lpg=PA347&amp;dq=serbo-croatian+pluricentric&amp;hl=hr#v=onepage&amp;q=serbo-croatian%20pluricentric&amp;f=false |series=Contributions to the sociology of language 62 |location=Berlin &amp; New York |year=1992 |oclc=24668375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kristophson, Jürgen |title=Vom Widersinn der Dialektologie: Gedanken zum Štokavischen |trans-title=Dialectological Nonsense: Thoughts on Shtokavian |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift für Balkanologie |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=178–186 |year=2000 |issn=0044-2356 |id={{ZDB|201058-6}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; These variants do differ slightly, as is the case with other pluricentric languages&lt;ref name=Blum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Badurina |editor1-first=Lada |editor2-last=Pranjković |editor2-first=Ivo |editor2-link=Ivo Pranjković |editor3-last=Silić |editor3-first=Josip |title=Jezični varijeteti i nacionalni identiteti |publisher=Disput |pages=83–108 |language=Serbo-Croatian |chapter=Policentrični standardni jezik |trans-chapter=Polycentric Standard Language |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426269.POLICENTRICNI_STANDARDNI.PDF |deadurl=no |location=Zagreb |year=2009 |isbn=978-953-260-054-4 |oclc=437306433 |archivedate=4 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69f5Mtzox?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426269.POLICENTRICNI_STANDARDNI.PDF |accessdate=5 April 2013 |df= }} [http://data.onb.ac.at/rec/AC07252152 (ÖNB)].&lt;/ref&gt;, but not to a degree that would justify considering them as [[Language secessionism#In Serbo-Croatian|different languages]].

'''Straw-bale construction''' is a [[Building construction|building]] method that uses [[straw bale|bales of straw]] (commonly wheat, rice, rye and oats straw) as structural elements, [[building insulation]], or both. This construction method is commonly used in [[natural building]] or "brown" construction projects. Research has shown that straw-bale construction is a sustainable method for building, from the standpoint of both materials and energy needed for heating and cooling.&lt;ref&gt;Milutiene, Edita, et al. "increase in Buildings Sustainability Using Renewable materials and Energy." Clean Technologies &amp; Environmental policy 14.6 (2012): 1075-84.Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages of straw-bale construction over conventional building systems include the renewable nature of straw, cost, easy availability, naturally fire-retardant and high insulation value.&lt;ref&gt;Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.

==History==
Straw houses have been built on the African plains since the [[Paleolithic]] Era. Straw bales were used in construction 400 years ago in Germany; and straw-thatched roofs have long been used in northern Europe and Asia. When European Settlers came to North America, [[Tipi|teepees]] were insulated in winter with loose straw between the inner lining and outer cover.&lt;ref name=viable&gt;Marks, Leanne R.  (2005).

Straw-bale construction was greatly facilitated by the mechanical hay baler, which was invented in the 1850s and was widespread by the 1890s.&lt;ref name=viable /&gt;  It proved particularly useful in the [[Sand Hills (Nebraska)|Nebraska Sandhills]]. Pioneers seeking land under the 1862 [[Homestead Act]] and the 1904 [[Kinkaid Act]] found a dearth of trees over much of Nebraska. In many parts of the state, the soil was suitable for [[Dugout (shelter)|dugouts]] and [[sod house]]s.&lt;ref name=custersurvey&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/histpres/reports/custer_county.pdf Nebraska Historic Buildings Survey: Custer County]  [http://www.nebraskahistory.org/index.htm Nebraska State Historical Society.]  Retrieved 2010-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first documented use of hay bales in construction in Nebraska was a schoolhouse built in 1896 or 1897. Unfenced and unprotected by stucco or plaster, it was reported in 1902 as having been eaten by cows. To combat this, builders began plastering their bale structures; if cement or lime stucco was unavailable, locally obtained "gumbo mud" was employed.&lt;ref name=laststraw /&gt; Between 1896 and 1945, an estimated 70 straw-bale buildings, including houses, farm buildings, churches, schools, offices, and grocery stores had been built in the Sandhills.&lt;ref name=viable /&gt;  In 1990, nine surviving bale buildings were reported in [[Arthur County, Nebraska|Arthur]] and [[Logan County, Nebraska|Logan]] Counties,&lt;ref name=arthursurvey&gt;Kay, John, David Anthone, Robert Kay, and Christina Hugly (1990).

Since the 1990s straw-bale construction has been substantially revived, particularly in North America, Europe, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Hollis | first=Murray | year=2005 | title=Practical Straw Bale Building | publisher=Landlinks Press | location=Collingwood | isbn=0-643-06977-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revival is likely attributed to greater environmental awareness and the material's natural, non-toxic qualities, low [[embodied energy]], and relative affordability.  Straw-bale construction has encountered issues regarding building codes depending on the location of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Henderson

However, in the USA, the introduction of Appendices S and R in the 2015 International Residential Code has helped to legitimize and improve understanding of straw-bale construction. In France, the approval in 2012 of professional rules for straw-building recognized it as “common technology” et qualifies for standard-insurance programs&lt;ref&gt;http://rfcp.fr/les-regles-professionnelles/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Method==

Straw bale building typically consists of stacking rows of bales (often in [[Stretcher bond|running-bond]]) on a raised footing or [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]], with a moisture barrier or capillary break between the bales and their supporting platform.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Barbara|title=Building with Straw Bales: A Practical Guide for UK and Ireland|publisher=Green Books|location=Dartington, Totnes, Devon TQ9 6EB|year=2002|edition=2011|page=26|isbn=978-1-900322-51-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of straw-bales commonly used, those bound together with two strings and those with three.  The three string bale is the larger in all three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Keefe |first=Chris |title=Straw Bale Design - Choosing the Right Size Straw Bales |url=http://www.strawbale.com/straw-bale-design-choosing-your-bales/ |publisher=Strawbale.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bale walls can be tied together with pins of [[bamboo]] or [[wood]] (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then [[stucco]]ed or [[plaster]]ed, either with a lime-based formulation or earth/clay render. The bales may actually provide the structural support for the building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Malin |first=Nadav |title=Building With Straw Bale |publisher=.buildinggreen.com |date=1 May 1993 |accessdate=5 October 2013 |url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/1993/5/1/Building-with-Straw-Bales/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("[[load-bearing wall|load-bearing]]" or "Nebraska-style" technique), as was the case in the original examples from the late 19th century. The plastered bale assembly also can be designed to provide [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] and shear [[Support (structure)|support]] for wind and seismic loads.

[[File:Lehmverputztes Strohballenhaus.jpg|thumb|left|This straw bale house plastered with [[loam]] [[earthen plaster]] is located in [[Swalmen]], in the southeastern [[Netherlands]]]]
Alternatively, bale buildings can have a structural frame of other materials, usually lumber or timber-frame, with bales simply serving as insulation and plaster substrate, ("infill" or "non-loadbearing" technique), which is most often required in northern regions and/or in wet climates. In northern regions, the potential snow-loading can exceed the strength of the bale walls. In wet climates, the imperative for applying a vapor-permeable finish precludes the use of cement-based stucco. Additionally, the inclusion of a skeletal framework of wood or metal allows the erection of a roof prior to raising the bales, which can protect the bale wall during construction, when it is the most vulnerable to water damage in all but the most dependably arid climates. A combination of [[Framing (construction)|framing]] and load-bearing techniques may also be employed, referred to as "hybrid" straw bale construction.&lt;ref name=MacDonald&gt;{{cite book |last= Myhrman |first= Matts |author2=S.O. MacDonald  |title= Build it with Bales |publisher= Out on Bale |year= 1994 |isbn= 0-9642821-1-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Straw bale house03.jpg|thumb|right|Straw bale construction]]
Straw bales can also be used as part of a [[Spar and Membrane Structure]] (SMS) wall system in which lightly reinforced 5&amp;nbsp;- 8&amp;nbsp;cm (2 - 3") [[gunite]] or [[shotcrete]] skins are interconnected with extended "X" shaped light rebar in the head joints of the bales.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Gary, and Mannik, Henri, "Spar and Membrane Structure" The Last Straw journal, #17, Winter 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In this wall system the concrete skins provide structure, seismic reinforcing, and fireproofing, while the bales are used as leave-in [[formwork]] and insulation.

The [[University of Bath]] has completed a research programme which used ‘ModCell’ panels - pre-fabricated panels consisting of a wooden structural frame infilled with straw bales and rendered with a breathable lime-based system - to build 'BaleHaus', a straw bale construction on the university's campus. Monitoring work of the structure carried out by architectural researchers at the university has found that as well as reducing the environmental footprint, the construction offers other benefits, including healthier living through higher levels of thermal insulation and regulation of humidity levels. The group has published a number of research papers on its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BaleHaus: innovation in straw bale building|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/research/case-studies/balehaus-innovative-straw-bale-building|work=The University of Bath|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically "field bales" (bales created on farms with baling machines) have been used, but recently higher-density "precompressed" bales (or "straw-blocks") are increasing the loads that may be supported. Oryzatech out of Goleta, California has been developing rice straw compressed block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Alex |title=Lego Blocks from Straw |publisher=Buildinggreen.com |date=1 December 2009 |url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/2009/12/1/Lego-Blocks-from-Straw/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Field bales might support around 900&amp;nbsp;kg per linear meter of wall (600&amp;nbsp;lb./ lin. ft.), but the high density bales bear up to 6000&amp;nbsp;kg per linear meter of wall (4,000&amp;nbsp;lb./lin.ft.), and more. The basic bale-building method is now increasingly being extended to bound modules of other oft-recycled materials, including tire-bales, cardboard, paper, plastic, and used carpeting. The technique has also been extended to bags containing "bales" of wood chips or [[rice-hull bagwall construction|rice hulls]].&lt;ref name=Steen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Magwood /&gt;

Straw bales have also been used in very energy efficient high performance buildings such as the S-House&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hans-Peter Petek |url=http://www.s-house.at/presentations.htm |title=S-House |publisher=S-house.at |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Austria which meets the Passivhaus energy standard. In South Africa, a five-star lodge made from 10,000 strawbales has housed luminaries such as Nelson Mandela and Tony Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/five-star-didimala-lodge-is-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-strawbale-building/ |title=Five Star Didimala Lodge Is The World’s Largest Strawbale Building! |publisher=Inhabitat |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Swiss Alps, in the little village of [[Nax|Nax Mont-Noble]], construction works have begun in October 2011 for the first hotel in Europe built entirely with straw bales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mayaguesthouse.wordpress.com/ |title=Blog about the first hotel built with straw bales |publisher=Mayaguesthouse.wordpress.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harrison Vault,&lt;ref&gt;[http://skillful-means.com/pages/details.php?pid=14&amp;photonumber=1&amp;showphoto=vault01.jpg ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621161559/http://skillful-means.com/pages/details.php?pid=14&amp;photonumber=1&amp;showphoto=vault01.jpg |date=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Joshua Tree, California, is engineered to withstand the high seismic loads in that area using only the assembly consisting of bales, lath and plaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/a/tippingmar.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=dGlwcGluZ21hci5jb218dG0tcHVibGljLWRvY3VtZW50c3xneDo1OTU1YWQ2NWU1ODRjNDRj |title=Google Drive Viewer |publisher=Docs.google.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was used successfully for strawbale housing in rural China.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/a/tippingmar.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=dGlwcGluZ21hci5jb218dG0tcHVibGljLWRvY3VtZW50c3xneDozMTcyM2VlMTdlZDQ1MTQ |title=Google Drive Viewer |publisher=Docs.google.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straw bale domes along the Syrio-African rift at Kibbutz Lotan have an interior geodesic frame of steel pipes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kibbutzlotan.com/#!creative-ecology-eco-campus/cg14 EcoCampus, Center for Creative Ecology, Kibbutz Lotan]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another method to reap the benefits of straw is to incorporate straw-bale walls into a pre-existing structure.&lt;ref&gt;Whitty, Cadmon.

==Thermal Properties==
Compressed straw bales have a wide range of documented R-value. R-value is a measurement of a materials insulating quality, higher the number the more insulating.  The reported R-value ranges from 17-55 (in American units) or 3-9.6 (in SI) depending on the study, differing wall designs could be responsible for wide range in R-value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/1998/9/1/R-Value-of-Straw-Bales-Lower-Than-Previously-Reported/ |title=R-Value of Straw Bales Lower Than Previously Reported - EBN: 7:9 |publisher=Buildinggreen.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceee.org/proceedings-paper/ss98/panel01/paper04 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710075736/http://aceee.org/proceedings-paper/ss98/panel01/paper04 |date=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bale walls are typically coated with a thick layer of plaster, which provides a well-distributed [[thermal mass]], active on a short-term (diurnal) cycle. The combination of insulation and mass provide an excellent platform for [[passive solar building design]] for winter and summer.

Compressed and plastered straw bale walls are also resistant to fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecobuildnetwork.org/fire-test-video |title=Straw Bale Fire Test Video - Ecological Building Network |publisher=Ecobuildnetwork.org |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with straw-bale==
Two significant problems related to straw-bale construction are moisture and [[mold]]. During the construction phase, buildings need to be protected from rain and from water leakages into the body of the walls.&lt;ref&gt;http://thesustainablehome.net/do-straw-bale-buildings-last/&lt;/ref&gt; If exposed to water, compressed straw may expand due to absorption of moisture. In turn, this can cause more cracking through which more moisture can infiltrate. Further damage to the wall can be caused by mold releasing potentially toxic spores into the wall cavities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=145304|year=2003|author1=Kuhn|first1=D. M.|title=Indoor Mold, Toxigenic Fungi, and Stachybotrys chartarum: Infectious Disease Perspective|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|volume=16|issue=1|pages=144–172|last2=Ghannoum|first2=M. A.|doi=10.1128/CMR.16.1.144-172.2003|pmid=12525430}}&lt;/ref&gt; and into the air.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nachi.org/strawbalehomebasics2006.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In hot climates, where walls may have become internally dampened, internal temperatures may rise (due to decomposition of affected straw). While fire is generally considered a rare event, compressed straw or hay bales have the serious potential of undergoing spontaneous internal combustion.&lt;ref&gt;http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/agriculture/dairy/pastures-management/haystack-fires-spontaneous-combustion Vermin&lt;/ref&gt; Rats and mice can infiltrate straw bale homes during construction, so care must be taken to keep such animals out of the material. Other problems relate to straw dust which may cause breathing difficulties among people with allergies to straw or hay.&lt;ref&gt;http://envibuild.eu/archive/2014/proceedings2014/enviBUILD-2014-proceedings.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/298811-overview&lt;/ref&gt;

Several companies have developed prefabricated strawbale walls. A passive ecological house can easily be assembled with those panels.

In [[Newton's theory of gravitation]] and in various relativistic [[classical theories of gravitation]], such as [[general relativity]], the '''tidal tensor''' represents 
#''tidal accelerations'' of a cloud of (electrically neutral, nonspinning) [[test particle]]s,
#''tidal stresses'' in a small object immersed in an ambient gravitational field.

The tidal tensor represents the relative acceleration due to gravity of two test masses separated by an infinitesimal distance. The component &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{{a}{b}}&lt;/math&gt; represents the relative acceleration in the &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}&lt;/math&gt; direction produced a displacement in the &lt;math&gt;\hat{b}&lt;/math&gt; direction.

==Tidal tensor for a spherical body==
The most common example of tides is the tidal force around a spherical body (''e.g.'', a planet or a moon).
Here we compute the tidal tensor for the gravitational field outside an isolated spherically symmetric massive object.  According to Newton's gravitational law, the acceleration ''a'' at a distance ''r'' from a central mass ''m'' is 
:&lt;math&gt; a = -Gm/r^2&lt;/math&gt;
(to simplify the math, in the following derivations we use the convention of setting the [[gravitational constant]] G to one. To calculate the differential accelerations, the results are be multiplied by G.)

Let us adopt the [[frame field|frame]] in [[polar coordinates]] for our three-dimensional Euclidean space, and consider infinitesimal displacements in the radial and azimuthal directions, &lt;math&gt; \partial_r, \partial_\theta,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\partial_\phi&lt;/math&gt;, which are given the subscripts 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

:&lt;math&gt; \vec{\epsilon}_1 = \partial_r, \; \vec{\epsilon}_2 = \frac{1}{r} \, \partial_\theta, \; \vec{\epsilon}_3 = \frac{1}{r \sin \theta} \, \partial_\phi&lt;/math&gt;
We will directly compute each component of the tidal tensor, expressed in this frame.
First, compare the gravitational forces on two nearby objects lying on the same radial line at distances from the central body differing by a distance ''h'':
:&lt;math&gt; m/(r+h)^2 - m/r^2 = -2mh/r^3 + 3mh^2/r^4 + O(h^3) &lt;/math&gt;
Because in discussing tensors we are dealing with [[multilinear algebra]], we retain only first order terms, so &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{11} = -2m/r^3&lt;/math&gt;.  Since there is no acceleration in the &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; direction due to a displacement in the radial direction, the other radial terms are zero: &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{12} = \Phi_{13} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, we can compare the gravitational force on two nearby observers lying at the same radius &lt;math&gt;r = r_0&lt;/math&gt; but displaced by an (infinitesimal) distance ''h'' in the &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; direction.  Using some elementary trigonometry and the small angle approximation, we find that the force vectors differ by a vector tangent to the sphere which has magnitude
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{m}{r_0^2} \, \sin(\theta) \approx \frac{m}{r_0^2} \, \frac{h}{r_0} = \frac{m}{r_0^3} \, h&lt;/math&gt;
By using the small angle approximation, we have ignored all terms of order &lt;math&gt;O(h^2)&lt;/math&gt;, so the tangential components are &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{22} = \Phi_{33} = m/r^3&lt;/math&gt;.  Again, since there is no acceleration in the radial direction due to displacements in either of the azimuthal directions, the other azimuthal terms are zero: &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{21} = \Phi_{31} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Combining this information, we find that the tidal tensor is diagonal with frame components
&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\hat{a}\hat{b}} = \frac{m}{r^3}\operatorname{diag}(-2,1,1)&lt;/math&gt;
This is the ''Coulomb form'' characteristic of spherically symmetric central force fields in Newtonian physics.

==Hessian formulation==
In the more general case where the mass is not a single spherically symmetric central object, the tidal tensor can be derived from the [[gravitational potential]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, which obeys the [[Poisson equation]]:

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density of any matter present, and where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Laplace operator]].  Note that this equation implies that in a [[vacuum solution]], the potential is simply a [[harmonic function]].

The ''tidal tensor'' is given by the ''traceless part'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= |first= |author-link= |arxiv=1201.4827 |title=Evidence for Quadratic Tidal Tensor Bias from the Halo Bispectrum |journal= Physical Review D|volume= 86|issue= 8|date=13 January 2018 |last1= Baldauf|first1= Tobias|last2= Seljak|first2= Uros|last3= Desjacques|first3= Vincent|last4= McDonald|first4= Patrick|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.86.083540|bibcode= 2012PhRvD..86h3540B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

of the [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]]
:&lt;math&gt; J_{ab} = \frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial x^a \, \partial x^b}&lt;/math&gt;
where we are using the standard ''Cartesian chart'' for E&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, with the Euclidean [[metric tensor]]
:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2, \; -\infty &lt; x,y,z &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;
Using standard results in vector calculus, this is readily converted to expressions valid in other coordinate charts, such as the ''polar spherical chart''
:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = d\rho^2 + \rho^2 \, \left( d\theta^2 + \sin(\theta)^2 \, d\phi^2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; \rho &lt; \infty, \; 0 &lt; \theta &lt; \pi, \; -\pi &lt; \phi &lt; \pi&lt;/math&gt;

===Spherically symmetric field===

As an example, we can calculate the tidal tensor for a spherical body using the Hessian.  Next, let us plug the gravitational potential &lt;math&gt;U = -m/\rho&lt;/math&gt; into the Hessian.  We can convert the expression above to one valid in polar spherical coordinates, or we can convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates before plugging in.  Adopting the second course, we have &lt;math&gt;U = -m/\sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2)&lt;/math&gt;, which gives
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{ab} = \frac{m}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{5/2}} \, \left[ \begin{matrix} y^2+z^2-2x^2 &amp; -3xy &amp; -3xz \\ -3xy &amp; x^2+z^2-2y^2 &amp; -3yz \\ -3xz &amp; -3yz &amp; x^2+y^2-2z^2 \end{matrix} \right] &lt;/math&gt;
After a rotation of our frame, which is adapted to the polar spherical coordinates, this expression agrees with our previous result.  (The easiest way to see this is probably to set y,z to zero so that the off-diagonal terms vanish and &lt;math&gt;\rho=x&lt;/math&gt;, and then invoke the spherical symmetry.)

The '''Tocharian alphabet''' is a version of [[Brahmi script]] used to write the Central Asian Indo-European [[Tocharian languages]], mostly from the 8th century (with a few earlier ones) that were written on palm leaves, wooden tablets and Chinese [[paper]], preserved by the extremely dry climate of the [[Tarim Basin]]. Samples of the language have been discovered at sites in [[Kucha]] and [[Karasahr]], including many mural inscriptions.

Tocharian A and B are not [[mutually intelligible]]. Properly speaking, based on the tentative interpretation of ''twqry'' as related to ''Tokharoi'', only Tocharian A may be referred to as ''Tocharian'', while Tocharian B could be called ''Kuchean'' (its native name may have been ''kuśiññe''), but since their grammars are usually treated together in scholarly works, the terms A and B have proven useful. A common Proto-Tocharian language must precede the attested languages by several centuries, probably dating to the 1st millennium BC. Given the small geographical range of and the lack of secular texts in Tocharian A, it might alternatively have been a [[liturgical language]], the relationship between the two being similar to that between [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]. However, the lack of a secular corpus in Tocharian A is by no means definite, due to the fragmentary preservation of Tocharian texts in general.

The alphabet the [[Tocharians]] were using is derived from the [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]] alphabetic syllabary ([[abugida]]) and is referred to as ''slanting Brahmi''. It soon became apparent that a large proportion of the manuscripts were translations of known [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] works in [[Sanskrit]] and some of them were even bilingual, facilitating decipherment of the new language. Besides the Buddhist and [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] religious texts, there were also monastery correspondence and accounts, commercial documents, caravan permits, and medical and magical texts, and one love poem. Many Tocharians embraced Manichaean duality or Buddhism.

In 1998, Chinese linguist [[Ji Xianlin]] published a translation and analysis of fragments of a Tocharian [[Maitreyasamiti-Nataka]] discovered in 1974 in [[Yanqi Hui Autonomous County|Yanqi]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2008/01/29/fragments_of_the_tocharian/index.html Fragments of the Tocharian]", Andrew Leonard, ''How the World Works'', [[Salon.com]], January 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3107526 Review of 'Fragments of the Tocharian A Maitreyasamiti-Nataka of the Xinjiang Museum, China. In Collaboration with Werner Winter and Georges-Jean Pinault by Ji Xianlin']", J. C. Wright, ''[[Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]'', [[University of London]], Vol. 62, No. 2 (1999), pp. 367–370&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/3110149044 Fragments of the Tocharian a Maitreyasamiti-Nataka of the Zinjiang Museum, China]", Ji Xianlin, Werner Winter, Georges-Jean Pinault, ''Trends in Linguistics, Studies and Monographs''&lt;/ref&gt;

Tocharian script probably died out after 840, when the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] were expelled from Mongolia by the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], retreating to the Tarim Basin. This theory is supported by the discovery of translations of Tocharian texts into Uyghur. During Uyghur rule, the peoples mixed with the Uyghurs to produce much of the modern population of what is now [[Xinjiang]].

==The Tocharian Script==

The Tocharian script is based on Brahmi, where each consonant has an inherent vowel, which can be altered by adding a vowel mark, or removed with a special nullifying mark, the [[virama]]. Like Brahmi, Tocharian uses stacking for conjunct consonants, and has irregular conjunct forms of [[File:Tocharian letter ra.gif|30px]], ra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gippert|first=Jost|title=Tocharian Brahmi Script|url=http://titus.fkidg1.uni-frankfurt.de/didact/idg/toch/tochbr.htm|publisher=TITUS Didactica|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to describe the effect is the aphorism "the appetite grows by what it feeds on".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vernon |first=Richard |last2= |first2= |date=July 1987 |title= Citizenship and Employment in an Age of High Technology |url= |journal=British Journal of Industrial Relations |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |volume= 25 |issue=02 |pages=201–225  |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8543.1987.tb00709.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, after greater [[social justice]] is achieved, there may be more fervent opposition to even smaller social injustices than before.

The effect suggests a link between [[social equality]] or concessions by the regime and [[unintended consequences]], as social reforms can raise expectations that can't be matched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vernon |first=Ronald |last2= |first2= |date=February 1979 |title= Unintended Consequences |url= |journal=Political Theory |publisher=Sage Publications |volume= 07 |issue=01 |pages=57–73  |jstor=190824 |doi=10.1177/009059177900700104}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Tocqueville effect, a [[revolution]] is likely to occur after an improvement in social conditions in contrast to [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s theory of progressive immiseration of the proletariat (deterioration of conditions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elster |first=Jon |date=2011 |title=Tocqueville: The Ancien Régime and the French Revolution |url= |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=xv |isbn=1139498819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, political scientist [[James Chowning Davies]] has proposed a [[J curve#Political science (model of revolutions)|J curve of revolutions]] which contends that periods of wealth and advancement are followed by periods of worsening conditions, leading to a revolution. [[Ted Robert Gurr]] also used the term ''[[relative deprivation]]'' to put forth that revolutions happen when there is an expectation of improvement, and a harsh reality in contrast.&lt;ref name="Finkel and Gehlbach"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Finkel |first=Evgeny|last2=Gehlbach |first2=Scott |date=16 July 2018 |title= The Tocqueville Paradox: When Does Reform Provoke Rebellion? |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3202013 |journal= |publisher=Social Science Research Network |volume=  |issue=01 |pages=  |jstor= |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3202013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an increased chance of the Tocqueville paradox happening in centrally planned but locally implemented reforms, when local implementation falls short of the higher reference point.&lt;ref name="Finkel and Gehlbach" /&gt;

== Origin ==
Alexis de Tocqueville first described the phenomenon in his book ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1840):
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The hatred that men bear to privilege increases in proportion as privileges become fewer and less considerable, so that democratic passions would seem to burn most fiercely just when they have least fuel. I have already given the reason for this phenomenon. When all conditions are unequal, no inequality is so great as to offend the eye, whereas the slightest dissimilarity is odious in the midst of general uniformity; the more complete this uniformity is, the more insupportable the sight of such a difference becomes. Hence it is natural that the love of equality should constantly increase together with equality itself, and that it should grow by what it feeds on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Tocqueville |first= Alexis de |authorlink1= |title= Democracy in America|year= 1840 |publisher= Saunders and Otley |location= London | chapter = Chapter III: That the sentiments of democratic nations accord with their opinions in leading them to concentrate political power | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0EPSjMel_-kC&amp;pg=PA106 |page= 272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reform and revolution paradox was explained in his next book, ''[[The Old Regime and the Revolution]]'' (1856):&lt;ref name="Finkel and Gehlbach" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The regime that a revolution destroys is almost always better than the one that immediately preceded it, and experience teaches that the most dangerous time for a bad government is usually when it begins to reform.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18028">In the [[security engineering]] subspecialty of [[computer science]], a '''trusted system''' is a system that is relied upon to a specified extent to enforce a specified security policy. This is equivalent to saying that a trusted system is one whose failure would break a security policy (if a policy exists that the trusted system is trusted to enforce).

The meaning of the word "trust" is critical, as it does not carry the meaning that might be expected in everyday usage. A system trusted by a user, is one that the user feels safe to use, and trusts to do tasks without secretly executing harmful or unauthorised programs; while trusted computing refers to whether programs can trust the platform to be unmodified from that expected, whether or not those programs are innocent, [[malware|malicious]] or execute tasks that are undesired by the user.

==Trusted systems in classified information==

A subset of trusted systems ("Division B" and "Division A") implement [[mandatory access control]] (MAC) labels; as such, it is often assumed that they can be used for processing [[classified information]]. However, this is generally untrue. There are four modes in which one can operate a multilevel secure system: multilevel mode, compartmented mode, dedicated mode, and system-high mode. The National Computer Security Center's "Yellow Book" specifies that B3 and A1 systems can only be used for processing a strict subset of security labels, and only when operated according to a particularly strict configuration.

Central to the concept of [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]-style "trusted systems" is the notion of a "[[reference monitor]]", which is an entity that occupies the logical heart of the system and is responsible for all access control decisions. Ideally, the reference monitor is (a) tamper-proof, (b) always invoked, and (c) small enough to be subject to independent testing, the completeness of which can be assured. Per the U.S. [[National Security Agency]]'s 1983 [[Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria]] (TCSEC), or "Orange Book", a set of "evaluation classes" were defined that described the features and assurances that the user could expect from a trusted system.

Key to the provision of the highest levels of assurance (B3 and A1) is the dedication of significant system engineering toward minimization of the complexity (not ''size'', as often cited) of the [[trusted computing base]] (TCB), defined as that combination of hardware, software, and firmware that is responsible for enforcing the system's security policy.

An inherent engineering conflict would appear to arise in higher-assurance systems in that, the smaller the TCB, the larger the set of hardware, software, and firmware that lies outside the TCB and is, therefore, untrusted.  Although this may lead the more technically naive to sophists' arguments about the nature of trust, the argument confuses the issue of "correctness" with that of "trustworthiness".

In contrast to the TCSEC's precisely defined hierarchy of six evaluation classes&amp;mdash;the highest of which, A1, is featurally identical to B3, differing only in documentation standards&amp;mdash;the more recently introduced [[Common Criteria]] (CC)&amp;mdash;which derive from a blend of more or less technically mature standards from various [[NATO]] countries&amp;mdash;provide a more tenuous spectrum of seven "evaluation classes" that intermix features and assurances in an arguably non-hierarchical manner and lack the philosophic precision and mathematical stricture of the TCSEC. In particular, the CC tolerate very loose identification of the "target of evaluation" (TOE) and support&amp;mdash;even encourage&amp;mdash;an inter-mixture of security requirements culled from a variety of predefined "protection profiles." While a strong case can be made that even the more seemingly arbitrary components of the TCSEC contribute to a "chain of evidence" that a fielded system properly enforces its advertised security policy, not even the highest (E7) level of the CC can truly provide analogous consistency and stricture of evidentiary reasoning.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The mathematical notions of trusted systems for the protection of [[classified information]] derive from two independent but interrelated corpora of work. In 1974, David Bell and Leonard LaPadula of MITRE, working under the close technical guidance and economic sponsorship of Maj. Roger Schell, Ph.D., of the U.S. Army Electronic Systems Command (Ft. Hanscom, MA), devised what is known as the [[Bell-LaPadula model]], in which a more or less trustworthy computer system is modeled in terms of '''objects''' (passive repositories or destinations for data, such as files, disks, printers) and '''subjects''' (active entities&amp;mdash;perhaps users, or system processes or threads operating on behalf of those users&amp;mdash;that cause information to flow among objects). The entire operation of a computer system can indeed be regarded a "history" (in the serializability-theoretic sense) of pieces of information flowing from object to object in response to subjects' requests for such flows.

At the same time, Dorothy Denning at Purdue University was publishing her Ph.D. dissertation, which dealt with "lattice-based information flows" in computer systems. (A mathematical "lattice" is a partially ordered set, characterizable as a directed acyclic graph, in which the relationship between any two vertices is either "dominates," "is dominated by," or neither.) She defined a generalized notion of "labels"&amp;mdash;corresponding more or less to the full security markings one encounters on classified military documents, ''e.g.'', TOP SECRET WNINTEL TK DUMBO&amp;mdash;that are attached to entities.  Bell and LaPadula integrated Denning's concept into their landmark MITRE technical report&amp;mdash;entitled, ''Secure Computer System: Unified Exposition and Multics Interpretation''&amp;mdash;whereby labels attached to objects represented the sensitivity of data contained within the object (though there can be, and often is, a subtle semantic difference between the sensitivity of the data within the object and the sensitivity of the object itself), while labels attached to subjects represented the trustworthiness of the user executing the subject. The concepts are unified with two properties, the "simple security property" (a subject can only read from an object that it ''dominates'' [''is greater than'' is a close enough&amp;mdash;albeit mathematically imprecise&amp;mdash;interpretation]) and the "confinement property," or "*-property" (a subject can only write to an object that dominates it). (These properties are loosely referred to as "no-read-up" and "no-write-down," respectively.) Jointly enforced, these properties ensure that information cannot flow "downhill" to a repository whence insufficiently trustworthy recipients may discover it. By extension, assuming that the labels assigned to subjects are truly representative of their trustworthiness, then the  no-read-up and no-write-down rules rigidly enforced by the reference monitor are provably sufficient to constrain [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]], one of the most general classes of attack (''sciz.'', the popularly reported [[Computer worm|worms]] and [[viruses]] are specializations of the Trojan horse concept).

The Bell-LaPadula model technically only enforces "confidentiality," or "secrecy," controls, ''i.e.'', they address the problem of the sensitivity of objects and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately disclose it. The dual problem of "integrity"(i.e., the problem of accuracy, or even provenance of objects)  and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately modify or destroy it, is addressed by mathematically affine models; the most important of which is named for its creator, [[Biba_Model|K. J. Biba]]. Other integrity models include the [[Clark-Wilson model]] and Shockley and Schell's program integrity model, "The SeaView Model"&lt;ref&gt;Lunt, Teresa &amp; Denning, Dorothy &amp; R. Schell, Roger &amp; Heckman, Mark &amp; R. Shockley, William. (1990). The SeaView Security Model.. IEEE Trans. Software Eng.. 16. 593-607. 10.1109/SECPRI.1988.8114. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220071090_The_SeaView_Security_Model (Source)]&lt;/ref&gt;

An important feature of MACs, is that they are entirely beyond the control of any user. The TCB automatically attaches labels to any subjects executed on behalf of users and files they access or modify. In contrast, an additional class of controls, termed [[discretionary access control]]s(DACs), '''are''' under the direct control of the system users. Familiar protection mechanisms such as [[File_system_permissions#Numeric_notation|permission bits]] (supported by UNIX since the late 1960s and&amp;mdash;in a more flexible and powerful form&amp;mdash;by Multics since earlier still) and [[access control list|access control lists (ACLs)]] are familiar examples of DACs.

The behavior of a trusted system is often characterized in terms of a mathematical model&amp;mdash;which may be more or less rigorous depending upon applicable operational and administrative constraints&amp;mdash;that takes the form of a [[finite state machine]] (FSM) with state criteria, state [[transition constraint]]s, a set of "operations" that correspond to state transitions (usually, but not necessarily, one), and a [[Multiple_single-level#Cross-domain_solutions|descriptive top-level specification]] (DTLS) which entails a user-perceptible [[interface (computing)|interface]] (''e.g.'', an [[API]], a set of [[system call]]s [in [[UNIX]] parlance] or [[Exit_(system_call)|system exit]]s [in [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] parlance]); each element of which engenders one or more model operations.

==Trusted systems in trusted computing==

The [[Trusted Computing Group]] creates specifications that are meant to address particular requirements of trusted systems, including attestation of configuration and safe storage of sensitive information.

==Trusted systems in policy analysis==

Trusted systems in the context of [[national security|national]] or [[homeland security]], [[code enforcement|law enforcement]], or [[social control]] policy are systems in which some conditional [[prediction]] about the behavior of people or objects within the system has been determined prior to authorizing access to system resources.&lt;ref&gt;The concept of trusted systems described here is discussed in Taipale, K.A. (2005). [http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MIS.2005.89 The Trusted Systems Problem: Security Envelopes, Statistical Threat Analysis, and the Presumption of Innocence], Homeland Security - Trends and Controversies, IEEE Intelligent Systems, Vol. 20 No. 5, pp. 80-83 (Sept./Oct. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, trusted systems include the use of "security envelopes" in national security and counterterrorism applications, "[[trusted computing]]" initiatives in technical systems security, and the use of [[credit score|credit or identity scoring]] systems in financial and anti-fraud applications; in general, they include any system (i) in which probabilistic threat or [[Probabilistic risk assessment|risk analysis]] is used to assess "trust" for decision-making before authorizing access or for allocating resources against likely threats (including their use in the design of systems [[Integrity constraints|constraints]] to control behavior within the system), or (ii) in which [[deviation analysis (computing)|deviation analysis]] or systems [[surveillance]] is used to ensure that behavior within systems complies with expected or authorized parameters.

The widespread adoption of these authorization-based security strategies (where the default state is DEFAULT=DENY) for counterterrorism, anti-fraud, and other purposes is helping accelerate the ongoing transformation of modern societies from a notional Beccarian model of [[criminal justice]] based on accountability for deviant actions after they occur – see [[Cesare Beccaria]], On Crimes and Punishment (1764) – to a Foucauldian model based on authorization, preemption, and general social compliance through ubiquitous preventative [[surveillance]] and control through system constraints – see [[Michel Foucault]], ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975, [[Alan Sheridan]], tr., 1977, 1995).

In this emergent model, "security" is geared not towards [[policing]] but to [[risk management]] through [[surveillance]], exchange of information, [[auditing]], communication, and [[Categorization|classification]].  These developments have led to general concerns about individual [[privacy]] and [[civil liberty]] and to a broader [[philosophical]] debate about the appropriate forms of [[social control|social governance]] methodologies.

==Trusted systems in information theory==

Trusted systems in the context of [[information theory]] is based on the definition of trust as ''''Trust is that which is essential to a communication channel but cannot be transferred from a source to a destination using that channel'''' by Ed Gerck.&lt;ref name="Trust Points"&gt;Feghhi, J. and P. Williams (1998) ''Trust Points'', in Digital Certificates: Applied Internet Security. Addison-Wesley, {{ISBN|0-201-30980-7}}; [http://mcwg.org/mcg-mirror/trustdef.htm Toward Real-World Models of Trust: Reliance on Received Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Information Theory]], information has nothing to do with knowledge or meaning. In the context of Information Theory, information is simply that which is transferred from a source to a destination, using a communication channel. If, before transmission, the information is available at the destination then the transfer is zero. Information received by a party is that which the party does not expect—as measured by the uncertainty of the party as to what the message will be.

Likewise, trust as defined by Gerck has nothing to do with friendship, acquaintances, employee-employer relationships, loyalty, betrayal and other overly-variable concepts.  Trust is not taken  in the purely subjective sense either,  nor as a feeling or something purely personal or psychological—trust is understood as something potentially communicable. Further, this definition of trust is abstract, allowing different instances and observers in a trusted system  to communicate based on a common idea of trust (otherwise communication would be isolated in domains), where all necessarily different subjective and intersubjective realizations of trust in each subsystem (man and machines) may coexist.&lt;ref name="Trust as Qualified Reliance"&gt;[http://nma.com/papers/it-trust-part1.pdf Trust as Qualified Reliance on Information, Part I], The COOK Report on Internet, Volume X, No. 10, January 2002, {{ISSN|1071-6327}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together in the model of Information Theory, '''information is what you do not expect''' and '''trust is what you know'''. Linking both concepts, trust is seen as  '''qualified reliance on received information'''. In terms of trusted systems, an assertion of trust cannot be based on the record itself, but on information from other information channels.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, John D. (1997). [http://pages.ca.inter.net/~euclid1/call.html John D. Electronic Legal Records: Pretty Good Authentication?]&lt;/ref&gt; The deepening of these questions leads to complex conceptions of trust which have been thoroughly studied in the context of business relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Huemer, L. (1998). [http://www.borea.nu/index.asp?PAGE=1&amp;ARTICLE=1&amp;saID=78 Trust in business relations: Economic logic or social interaction?] Umeå: Boréa. {{ISBN|91-89140-02-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also leads to conceptions of information where the "quality" of information integrates trust or trustworthiness in the structure of the information itself and of the information system(s) in which it is conceived: higher quality in terms of particular definitions of accuracy and precision means higher trustworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kristo Ivanov|Ivanov, K.]]  (1972). [http://www.informatik.umu.se/~kivanov/diss-avh.html Quality-control of information: On the concept of accuracy of information in data banks and in management information systems].The University of Stockholm and The Royal Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

An introduction to the calculus of trust (Example: 'If I connect two trusted systems, are they more or less trusted when taken together?') is given in.&lt;ref name="Trust as Qualified Reliance" /&gt;

The [[IBM]] Federal Software Group &lt;ref name="Daly, Christopher"&gt;Daly, Christopher. (2004). A Trust Framework for the DoD Network-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Environment, IBM Corp., 2004. (Request from the IEEE Computer Society's [http://issaa.org/documents/ ISSAA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726192910/http://issaa.org/documents/ |date=2011-07-26 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that &lt;ref name="Trust Points" /&gt; provides the most useful definition of trust for application in an information technology environment, because it is related to other information theory concepts and provides a basis for measuring trust. In a network centric enterprise services environment, such notion of trust is considered &lt;ref name="Daly, Christopher" /&gt; to be requisite for achieving the desired collaborative, service-oriented architecture vision.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7123">'''Truth-seeking''' processes allow societies to examine and come to grips with past crimes and atrocities and prevent their future repetition. Truth-seeking often occurs in societies emerging from a period of prolonged conflict or authoritarian rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/truth-and-memory|title=Truth-seeking, Memory, and Memorials - ICTJ|date=25 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous example to date is the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], although many other examples also exist. Most commonly these are carried out by official [[truth and reconciliation commission]]s as a form of [[restorative justice]], but there are other mechanisms as well.

Through a truth-seeking process, actors in a country are able to investigate past abuses  and seek redress for victims and their families. Such investigations go beyond simply identifying guilty parties or individuals, but may investigate root causes, patterns of suffering, and social impact as well as events in individual cases, such as disappearances.

By seeking to investigate such questions with a high degree of professionalism and commitment, truth-seeking processes seek to create long-lasting public impact, often through the publication of a public report. Such reporting helps expose the facts of violations and suffering, which are often otherwise denied, and minimize possibilities of revisionism in the future.

Given that truth-seeking requires both considerable time and resources to properly tackle investigations and victims’ needs, local community and regional representatives, [[civil society]] organizations, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and aid agencies, and governmental and judicial entities play different roles in this process.

==The Right to Truth==
Many steps taken in a truth-seeking process are based on the premise of a right to truth. The right to truth entails that victims and communities affected by past crimes have the right to know the identity of suspected perpetrators consistent with the rights of the suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ictj.org/publication/ex-combatants-and-truth-commissions|title=Ex-Combatants and Truth Commissions|date=20 April 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]]: "Any person who has suffered atrocities has the unalienable right to know who is responsible; any family whose members have disappeared has the basic right discover their fate and whereabouts; every society where these crimes have taken place have the right to learn their history without lies or denial."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ictj.org/gallery-items/right-truth|title = Right to the Truth|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher = International Center for Transitional Justice|access-date = 9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to truth is an emerging principle in customary international law. It has been recognized in the United Nations Principles on Impunity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derechos.org/nizkor/impu/principles.html|title=Equipo Nizkor - Updated Set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity.|website=derechos.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent [[UN]] materials, and the UN has declared March 24 to be the "International Day for the Right to the Truth Concerning Gross Human Rights Violations and for the Dignity of Victims" in memory of Archbishop [[Óscar Romero|Oscar Romero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.un.org/en/events/righttotruthday/documents.shtml|title = International Day for the Right to the Truth Concerning Gross Human Rights Violations and for the Dignity of Victims|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher = United Nations|access-date = 9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to truth has also been proclaimedby regional  bodies such as the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], and in some national courts.

==Truth-seeking Mechanisms==
Frequently used tactics during truth-seeking include the protection of evidence, collection of extensive victim data and testimony, the opening and maintenance of state information and public archives, and the publication of comprehensive reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/truth-and-memory|title=Truth-seeking, Memory, and Memorials - ICTJ|date=25 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To implement such practices, [[truth commissions]] are often established to represent voices of victims. Such commissions are typically independent in nature and focus on accountability for past crimes, the root causes for the conflict and constructing historical narratives countering revisionism of the past. Policy recommendations issued by commissions often lead to a call for national reforms and further [[transitional justice]] initiatives, such as reparations, vetting and prosecutions.

Official truth commissions (often called truth and reconciliation commissions) have taken place in many countries, including [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|South Africa]], [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)|Peru]], [[Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor|Timor-Leste]], [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Liberia)|Liberia]], the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Solomon Islands)|Solomon Islands]], and [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Korea)|South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usip.org/resources-tools/latest?filter1=**ALL**&amp;filter0=**ALL**&amp;filter2=2222&amp;filter3=**ALL**&amp;filter4=&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently truth commissions have begun to be implemented in developed countries such as [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Canada]] and [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Germany)|Germany]].

==Unofficial or Local Truth-seeking==
Unofficial or local truth-seeking projects became popular in the 1980s and 1990s in Latin America, when community organizations such as churches and academic institutions documented human rights violations and issued reports following the end to military rule. Though unofficial, such efforts from civil society often serve to pave the way for or complement state- led transitional justice initiatives, and sometimes produce superior results, as in [[Historical Clarification Commission|Guatemala]]. Unofficial truth-seeking initiatives have also taken place more recently at the local level in Northern Ireland, the [[Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission|United States]], [[The Jeju 4.3 Committee|South Korea]], and elsewhere. Calls for truth-seeking processes continue to be debated in other countries, such as [[Truth and Reconciliation in Cambodia|Cambodia]] and [[Truth and Reconciliation in Colombia|Colombia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35142">The '''unconscious mind''' (or '''the unconscious''') consists of the processes in the [[mind]] which occur automatically and are not available to introspection, and include thought processes, memories, interests, and motivations.&lt;ref name="Westen1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Westen |first1=Drew |year=1999 |title=The Scientific Status of Unconscious Processes: Is Freud Really Dead? |journal=Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=1061–1106 |doi=10.1177/000306519904700404 |url=http://apa.sagepub.com/content/47/4/1061 |accessdate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though these processes exist well under the surface of [[Conscious mind|conscious]] awareness they are theorized to exert an impact on behavior. The term was coined by the 18th-century German [[Romantic philosophy|Romantic philosopher]] [[Friedrich Schelling]] and later introduced into English by the poet and essayist [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;ref name=Macmillan&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bynum |author2=Browne |author3=Porter |authorlink3=Roy Porter |title=The Macmillan Dictionary of the History of Science |location=London |year=1981 |page=292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;Christopher John Murray, ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004: {{ISBN|1-57958-422-5}}), pp. 1001–02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirical evidence suggests that unconscious phenomena include repressed feelings, automatic skills, subliminal perceptions, thoughts, habits, and automatic reactions,&lt;ref name="Westen1999" /&gt; and possibly also [[Complex (psychology)|complexes]], hidden phobias and desires.

The concept was popularized by the Austrian neurologist and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]. In [[psychoanalytic theory]], unconscious processes are understood to be directly represented in [[dream]]s, as well as in [[Freudian slip|slips of the tongue]] and [[joke]]s.

Thus the unconscious mind can be seen as the source of dreams and automatic thoughts (those that appear without any apparent cause), the repository of forgotten memories (that may still be accessible to consciousness at some later time), and the locus of implicit knowledge (the things that we have learned so well that we do them without thinking).

It has been argued that [[consciousness]] is influenced by other parts of the [[mind]]. These include unconsciousness as a [[habit (psychology)|personal habit]], [[self-awareness|being unaware]], and [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]]. Phenomena related to semi-consciousness include [[awake]]ning, [[implicit memory]], [[subliminal message]]s, [[trance]]s, [[hypnagogia]], and [[hypnosis]]. While [[sleep]], [[sleepwalking]], [[dream]]ing, [[delirium]], and [[coma]]s may signal the presence of unconscious processes, these processes are seen as symptoms rather than the unconscious mind itself.

Some critics have doubted the existence of the unconscious.&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stannard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Webster" /&gt;

==Historical overview==
The term "unconscious" ({{lang-de|Unbewusste}}) was coined by the 18th-century German Romantic philosopher Friedrich Schelling (in his ''[[System of Transcendental Idealism]]'', [http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Schelling,+Friedrich+Wilhelm+Joseph/System+des+transzendenten+Idealismus/6.+Hauptabschnitt.+Deduktion+eines+allgemeinen+Organs+der+Philosophie,+oder+Haupts%C3%A4tze+der+Philosophie+der+Kunst+nach+Grunds%C3%A4tzen+des+transzendentalen+Idealismus/%C2%A7+3.+Folges%C3%A4tze ch. 6, § 3]) and later introduced into English by the poet and essayist Samuel Taylor Coleridge (in his ''[[Biographia Literaria]]'').&lt;ref name=Macmillan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Murray /&gt; Some rare earlier instances of the term "unconsciousness" (''{{lang|De|Unbewußtseyn}}'') can be found in the work of the 18th-century German physician and philosopher [[Ernst Platner]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Platner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4748AAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=Unbewu%C3%9Ftseyn ''Philosophische Aphorismen nebst einigen Anleitungen zur philosophischen Geschichte''], Vol. 1 (Leipzig: Schwickertscher Verlag, 1793 [1776]), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angus Nicholls and Martin Liebscher, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Thinking_the_Unconscious.html?id=MCJzE-SxDUgC&amp;redir_esc=y ''Thinking the Unconscious: Nineteenth-Century German Thought''] (2010), Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influences on thinking that originate from outside of an individual's consciousness were reflected in the ancient ideas of temptation, divine inspiration, and the predominant role of the gods in affecting motives and actions. The idea of internalised unconscious processes in the mind was also instigated in antiquity and has been explored across a wide variety of [[cross-cultural communication|cultures]]. Unconscious aspects of mentality were referred to between 2500 and 600 BC in the Hindu texts known as the [[Vedas]], found today in [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, C. N. 1990.

==Psychology==

Psychologist Jacques Van Rillaer points out that, "the unconscious was not discovered by Freud. In 1890, when psychoanalysis was still unheard of, [[William James]], in his monumental treatise on psychology (''[[The Principles of Psychology]]''), examined the way [[Schopenhauer]], [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann|von Hartmann]], [[Pierre Janet|Janet]], [[Alfred Binet|Binet]] and others had used the term 'unconscious' and 'subconscious'".&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Catherine (edited by). ''Le livre noir de la psychanalyse: Vivre, penser et aller mieux sans Freud''. Paris: Les Arènes, 2005, p.217&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of psychology Mark Altschule observes that, "It is difficult—or perhaps impossible—to find a nineteenth-century psychologist or psychiatrist who did not recognize unconscious cerebration as not only real but of the highest importance."&lt;ref&gt;Altschule, Mark. ''Origins of Concepts in Human Behavior''. New York: Wiley, 1977, p.199&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Rilliaer could have also mentioned that [[Eduard von Hartmann]] published a book dedicated to this topic, ''Philosophy of the Unconscious,'' in 1869 -- long before anybody else.

Furthermore, 19th century German psychologists, [[Gustav Fechner]] and [[Wilhelm Wundt]], had begun to use the term in their experimental psychology, in the context of manifold, jumbled sense data that the mind organizes at an ''unconscious'' level before revealing it as a cogent totality in conscious form."&lt;ref&gt;Wozniak, Robert H. ''Mind and Body: Rene Déscartes to William James''. Washington DC: American Psychological Association, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
  
===Freud's view===
[[File:Structural-Iceberg.svg|thumb|right|240px|An iceberg is often (though misleadingly) used to provide a visual representation of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud's]] theory that most of the human mind operates unconsciously.]]
[[Sigmund Freud]] and his followers developed an account of the unconscious mind. It plays an important role in [[psychoanalysis]].

Freud divided the mind into the conscious mind (or the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]) and the unconscious mind. The latter was then further divided into the [[id, ego and superego|id]] (or [[instinct]]s and drive) and the [[superego]] (or [[conscience]]). In this theory, the unconscious refers to the mental processes of which individuals make themselves unaware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geraskov, Emil Asenov |title=The internal contradiction and the unconscious sources of activity |journal=Journal of Psychology |date=November 1, 1994 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16528826.html |quote=This article is an attempt to give new meaning to well-known experimental studies, analysis of which may allow us to discover unconscious behavior that has so far remained unnoticed by researchers. Those studies confirm many of the statements by Freud, but they also reveal new aspects of the unconscious psychic. The first global psychological concept of the internal contradiction as an unconscious factor influencing human behavior was developed by Sigmund Freud. In his opinion, this contradiction is expressed in the struggle between the biological instincts and the self. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425190957/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16528826.html |archivedate=April 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud proposed a vertical and [[hierarchical]] architecture of human consciousness: the [[conscious mind]], the [[preconscious]], and the unconscious [[mind]]—each lying beneath the other. He believed that significant psychic events take place "below the surface" in the unconscious mind,&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[dream]]ing: Freud called dream symbols the "royal road to the unconscious"&lt;/ref&gt; like hidden messages from the unconscious. He [[interpretation (logic)|interpreted]] such events as having both symbolic and actual significance.

In psychoanalytic terms, the unconscious does not include all that is not conscious, but rather what is actively repressed from conscious thought or what a person is averse to knowing consciously. Freud viewed the unconscious as a repository for socially unacceptable ideas, wishes or desires, traumatic memories, and painful emotions put out of mind by the mechanism of [[psychological repression]]. However, the contents did not necessarily have to be solely negative. In the psychoanalytic view, the unconscious is a force that can only be recognized by its effects—it expresses itself in the [[symptom]]. In a sense, this view places the conscious self as an adversary to its unconscious, warring to keep the unconscious hidden. Unconscious thoughts are not directly accessible to ordinary [[introspection]], but are supposed to be capable of being "tapped" and "interpreted" by special methods and techniques such as meditation, [[free association (psychology)|free association]] (a method largely introduced by Freud), dream analysis, and [[speech communication|verbal]] slips (commonly known as a [[Freudian slip]]), examined and conducted during [[psychoanalysis]]. Seeing as these unconscious thoughts are normally cryptic, psychoanalysts are considered experts in interpreting their messages.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Freud based his concept of the unconscious on a variety of observations. For example, he considered "slips of the tongue" to be related to the unconscious in that they often appeared to show a person's true feelings on a subject. For example, "I decided to take a summer curse". This example shows a slip of the word "course" where the speaker accidentally used the word curse which would show that they have negative feelings about having to do this. Freud noticed that also his patient's dreams expressed important feelings they were unaware of. After these observations, he came to the conclusion that psychological disturbances are largely caused by personal conflicts existing at the unconscious level. His psychoanalytic theory acts to explain personality, motivation and mental disorders by focusing on unconscious determinants of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wnr7vEjB7NAC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=After+these+observations,+he+came+to+the+conclusion+that+psychological+disturbances+are+largely+caused+by+personal+conflicts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NO9hC_TkTb&amp;sig=x-vc5BDhhYll9BZjtd-pCfqhmCo&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1zqjUdmeG-Kn4AT-9IC4CQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=After%20these%20observations%2C%20he%20came%20to%20the%20conclusion%20that%20psychological%20disturbances%20are%20largely%20caused%20by%20personal%20conflicts&amp;f=false | title=Psychology: Themes and Variations | publisher=Cengage Learning | author=Wayne Weiten | year=2011 | pages=6 | isbn=9780495813101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud later used his notion of the unconscious in order to explain certain kinds of [[neurosis|neurotic]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jung, Carl|title=Man and His Symbols |date=1964 |quote=Sigmund Freud was the pioneer who first tried to explore empirically the unconscious background of consciousness. He worked on the general assumption that dreams are not a matter of chance but are associated with conscious thoughts and problems. This assumption was not in the least arbitrary. It was based upon the conclusion of eminent neurologists (for instance, Pierre Janet) that neurotic symptoms are related to some conscious experience. They even appear to be split-off areas of the conscious mind, which, at another time and under different conditions, can be conscious.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of the unconscious was substantially transformed by later psychiatrists, among them [[Carl Jung]] and [[Jacques Lacan]].

In his 1932/1933 conferences, Freud "proposes to abandon the notion of the unconscious that ambiguous judge".&lt;ref&gt;'Une histoire des sciences humaines'', sous la direction de J.-F. Dortier, éditions Sciences humaines, 2006, {{ISBN|9782912601360}} - part : 1900-1950 "Le temps des fondations" ; chapter about Freud&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jung's view===
{{Main|Carl Jung|Collective unconscious}}
Carl Gustav Jung, a Swiss [[psychiatrist]], developed the concept further. He agreed with Freud that the unconscious is a determinant of personality, but he proposed that the unconscious be divided into two layers: the personal unconscious and the collective unconscious. The personal unconscious is a reservoir of material that was once conscious but has been forgotten or suppressed, much like Freud's notion. The collective unconscious, however, is the deepest level of the psyche, containing the accumulation of inherited psychic structures and [[archetypal]] experiences. Archetypes are not memories but images with universal meanings that are apparent in the culture's use of symbols. The collective unconscious is therefore said to be inherited and contain material of an entire species rather than of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;"collective unconscious (psychology) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia." Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia. N.p., n.d. Web. 4 Dec. 2011. &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/125572/collective-unconscious&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Every person shares the collective unconscious with the entire human species, as Jung puts it: [the] "whole spiritual heritage of mankind's evolution, born anew in the brain structure of every individual".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J. (1971). Hero with a thousand faces. New York, NY: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the structure of the unconscious, Jung differed from Freud in that he did not believe that sexuality was at the base of all unconscious thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;"Jung, Carl Gustav." The Columbia encyclopedia. 6th. ed. Columbia: Columbia University Press, 2000. 1490. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The notion that the unconscious mind exists at all has been disputed.

[[Franz Brentano]] rejected the concept of the unconscious in his 1874 book ''[[Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint]]'', although his rejection followed largely from his definitions of consciousness and unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="Vitz"&gt;{{cite book |author=Vitz, Paul C. |title=Sigmund Freud's Christian Unconscious |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year=1988 |pages=59-62;107ff |isbn=0-89862-673-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] offers a critique of Freud's theory of the unconscious in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', based on the claim that consciousness is essentially self-conscious. Sartre also argues that Freud's theory of repression is internally flawed. Philosopher [[Thomas Baldwin (philosopher)|Thomas Baldwin]] argues that Sartre's argument is based on a misunderstanding of Freud.&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas Baldwin |editor=Ted Honderich |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=792 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erich Fromm]] contends that, "The term 'the unconscious' is actually a mystification (even though one might use it for reasons of convenience, as I am guilty of doing in these pages). There is no such thing as ''the'' unconscious; there are only experiences of which we are aware, and others of which we are not aware, that is, ''of which we are unconscious''. If I hate a man because I am afraid of him, and if I am aware of my hate but not of my fear, we may say that my hate is conscious and that my fear is unconscious; still my fear does not lie in that mysterious place: 'the' unconscious."&lt;ref&gt;Fromm, Erich. ''Beyond the Chains of Illusion: My Encounter with Marx &amp; Freud''. London: Sphere Books, 1980, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Searle]] has offered a critique of the Freudian unconscious. He argues that the Freudian cases of shallow, consciously held mental states would be best characterized as 'repressed consciousness,' while the idea of more deeply unconscious mental states is more problematic. He contends that the very notion of a collection of "thoughts" that exist in a privileged region of the mind such that they are ''in principle never accessible'' to conscious awareness, is incoherent. This is not to imply that there are not "nonconscious" processes that form the basis of much of conscious life. Rather, Searle simply claims that to posit the existence of something that is like a "thought" in every way except for the fact that no one can ever be aware of it (can never, indeed, "think" it) is an incoherent concept. To speak of "something" as a "thought" either implies that it is being thought by a thinker or that it could be thought by a thinker. Processes that are not causally related to the phenomenon called thinking are more appropriately called the nonconscious processes of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John. ''The Rediscovery of the Mind''. MIT Press, 1994, pp. 151-173&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics of the Freudian unconscious include [[David Stannard]],&lt;ref name="Stannard"&gt;See "The Problem of Logic", Chapter 3 of ''Shrinking History: On Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory'', published by Oxford University Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]],&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;See "Exploring the Unconscious: Self-Analysis and Oedipus", Chapter 11 of ''Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis'', published by The Orwell Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethan Watters]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;See "A Profession in Crisis", Chapter 1 of ''Therapy's Delusions: The Myth of the Unconscious and the Exploitation of Today's Walking Worried'', published by Scribner, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Ofshe]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and Eric Thomas Weber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weber ET | year = 2012 | title = James's Critiques of the Freudian Unconscious – 25 Years Earlier | url = http://williamjamesstudies.org/9.1/weber.pdf | format = PDF | journal = William James Studies | volume = 9 | issue =  | pages = 94–119 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130928003719/http://williamjamesstudies.org/9.1/weber.pdf | archivedate = 2013-09-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the lack of evidence for many Freudian hypotheses, some scientific researchers proposed the existence of unconscious mechanisms that are very different from the Freudian ones. They speak of a "cognitive unconscious" ([[John Kihlstrom]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kihlstrom, J.F. |chapter=The unconscious |editor=Ramachandran, V.S. |title=Encyclopedia of the Human Brain |publisher=Academic |location=San Diego CA |year=2002 |pages=635–646 |volume=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kihlstrom, J.F. |author2=Beer, J.S. |author3=Klein, S.B. |chapter=Self and identity as memory |editor1=Leary, M.R. |editor2=Tangney, J. |title=Handbook of self and identity |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2002 |pages=68–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an "adaptive unconscious" ([[Timothy Wilson]]),&lt;ref&gt;Wilson T D Strangers to Ourselves Discovering the Adaptive Unconscious&lt;/ref&gt; or a "dumb unconscious" (Loftus &amp; Klinger),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Loftus EF, Klinger MR |title=Is the unconscious smart or dumb? |journal=Am Psychol |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=761–5 |date=June 1992 |pmid=1616173 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/amp/47/6/761 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.47.6.761}}&lt;/ref&gt; which executes automatic processes but lacks the complex mechanisms of repression and symbolic return of the repressed.

In modern cognitive psychology, many researchers have sought to strip the notion of the unconscious from its Freudian heritage, and alternative terms such as "implicit" or "automatic" have come into currency. These traditions emphasize the degree to which cognitive processing happens outside the scope of cognitive awareness, and show that things we are unaware of can nonetheless influence other cognitive processes as well as behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenwald AG, Draine SC, Abrams RL |title=Three cognitive markers of unconscious semantic activation |journal=Science |volume=273 |issue=5282 |pages=1699–702 |date=September 1996 |pmid=8781230 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/273/5282/1699.long |doi=10.1126/science.273.5282.1699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gaillard R, Del Cul A, Naccache L, Vinckier F, Cohen L, Dehaene S |title=Nonconscious semantic processing of emotional words modulates conscious access |journal=Proc.

==Dreams==

===Freud===
In terms of the unconscious, the purpose of dreams, as stated by [[Freud]], is to fulfill repressed wishes through the process of dreaming, since they cannot be fulfilled in real life. For example, if someone were to rob a store and to feel guilty about it, they might dream about a scenario in which their actions were justified and renders them blameless. Freud asserted that the wish-fulfilling aspect of the dream may be disguised due to the difficulty in distinguishing between manifest content and latent content. The [[Manifest Content and Latent Content|manifest content]] consists of the plot of a dream at the surface level. The [[Manifest Content and Latent Content|latent content]] refers to the hidden or disguised meaning of the events in the plot. The latent content of the dream is what supports the idea of wish fulfillment. It represents the intimate information in the dreamer's current issues and childhood conflict.&lt;ref name=Weiten166&gt;{{cite book | title=Psychology: Themes and Variations | publisher=Cengage Learning | author=Wayne Weiten | year=2011 | pages=166–167 | isbn=9780495813101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposing theories===
In response to Freud's theory on dreams, other psychologists have come up with theories to counter his argument. Theorist Rosalind Cartwright proposed that dreams provide people with the opportunity to act out and work through everyday problems and emotional issues in a non-real setting with no consequences. According to her [[cognitive]] problem solving view, a large amount of continuity exists between our waking thought and the thoughts that exist in dreams. Proponents of this view believe that dreams allow participation in creative thinking and alternate ways to handle situations when dealing with personal issues because dreams are not restrained by logic or realism.&lt;ref name=Weiten166/&gt;

In addition to this, [[Allan Hobson]] and colleagues came up with the [[activation-synthesis hypothesis]] which proposes that dreams are simply the side effects of the neural activity in the brain that produces [[beta brain wave]]s during [[REM sleep]] that are associated with wakefulness. According to this hypothesis, neurons fire periodically during sleep in the lower brain levels and thus send random signals to the [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]]. The cortex then synthesizes a dream in reaction to these signals in order to try to make sense of why the brain is sending them. However, the hypothesis does not state that dreams are meaningless, it just downplays the role that emotional factors play in determining dreams.&lt;ref name=Weiten166/&gt;

==Contemporary cognitive psychology==

===Research===
While, historically, the psychoanalytic research tradition was the first to focus on the phenomenon of unconscious mental activity, there is an extensive body of conclusive research and knowledge in contemporary [[cognitive psychology]] devoted to the mental activity that is not mediated by conscious awareness.

Most of that (cognitive) research on unconscious processes has been done in the mainstream, academic tradition of the information processing paradigm. As opposed to the psychoanalytic tradition, driven by the relatively speculative (in the sense of being hard to empirically verify) theoretical concepts such as the [[Oedipus complex]] or [[Electra complex]], the cognitive tradition of research on unconscious processes is based on relatively few theoretical assumptions and is very empirically oriented (i.e., it is mostly data driven). Cognitive research has revealed that automatically, and clearly outside of conscious awareness, individuals register and acquire more information than what they can experience through their conscious thoughts. (See Augusto, 2010, for a recent comprehensive survey.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Augusto, L.M. |title=Unconscious knowledge: A survey |journal=Advances in Cognitive Psychology |volume=6 |pages=116–141 |year=2010 |url=http://www.ac-psych.org/?id=2&amp;rok=2010 |doi=10.2478/v10053-008-0081-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unconscious processing of information about frequency===
For example, an extensive line of research conducted by Hasher and Zacks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hasher L, Zacks RT |title=Automatic processing of fundamental information: the case of frequency of occurrence |journal=Am Psychol |volume=39 |issue=12 |pages=1372–88 |date=December 1984 |pmid=6395744 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.39.12.1372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has demonstrated that individuals register information about the frequency of events automatically (i.e., outside of conscious awareness and without engaging conscious information processing resources). Moreover, perceivers do this unintentionally, truly "automatically," regardless of the instructions they receive, and regardless of the information processing goals they have. The ability to unconsciously and relatively accurately tally the frequency of events appears to have little or no relation to the individual's age,&lt;ref name=Connolly&gt;Connolly, Deborah Ann (1993). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/636/ A developmental evaluation of frequency information in lists, scripts, and stories]'' (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University&lt;/ref&gt; education, intelligence, or personality, thus it may represent one of the fundamental building blocks of human orientation in the environment and possibly the acquisition of [[procedural knowledge]] and experience, in general.

The '''War of Ideas''' is a clash of opposing ideals, [[ideologies]], or concepts through which nations or groups use strategic influence to promote their interests abroad. The "battle space" of this conflict is the target population's "[[Winning hearts and minds|hearts and minds]]", while the "weapons" can include, inter alia, [[think tanks]], TV programs, newspaper articles, the internet, blogs, official government policy papers, traditional as well as [[public diplomacy]], or radio broadcasts.

They are, indeed, genuine wars, even though the physical violence might be minimal, because they serve a political, socio-cultural, or economic purpose, and they involve hostile intentions or hostile acts. Wars of ideas can assume many forms, but they tend to fall into four general categories (though these are not necessarily exhaustive): (a) intellectual debates, (b) ideological wars, (c) wars over religious dogma, and (d) advertising campaigns. All of them are essentially about power and influence, just as with wars over territory and material resources, and their stakes can run very high indeed|Echevarria 2008 ''Wars of Ideas and the War of Ideas''|Strategic Studies Institute of the US Army War College (SSI)}}.

==History of the concept==

{{quote|The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed, the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.|John Maynard Keynes |''The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money''|1936), chapter xxiv}}

[[Richard M. Weaver]] published ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'' in 1948 by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. The book is largely a treatise on the harmful effects of [[nominalism]] on [[Western civilization]] since that doctrine gained prominence in the [[High Middle Ages]], followed by a prescription of a course of action through which Weaver believes the West might be rescued from its decline. Weaver attributes the beginning of the Western decline to the adoption of nominalism (or the rejection of the notion of [[absolute truth]]) in the late [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] period.

In 1993, Heritage Foundation analyst James A. Phillips used the term "war of ideas" in describing the pivotal role played by the [[National Endowment for Democracy]] (NED) in the ideological battle for the protection of democracy. Phillips defended the NED as "an important weapon in the war of ideas," &lt;ref name=NED1993&gt;{{cite report |author=James A. Phillips |title=The National Endowment for Democracy: An Important Weapon in the War of Ideas |series=Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum |publisher=Heritage Foundation |number=360 |date=July 8, 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; against communist dictatorships in control of China, Cuba, North Korea, and Vietnam. In a [[Cato Institute]] Foreign Policy brief, it was argued that there was no longer a need for the NED because "the democratic West has won the war of ideas against its communist adversaries." &lt;ref name=NED1993/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; commemorating the 10th anniversary of 9/11, a round table was held bringing together [[Paul Berman]], Scott Malcomson, [[James Traub]], [[David Rieff]], [[Ian Burama]] and [[Michael Ignatieff]]. Malcomson observed, 

{{quote|The American reaction to being attacked on September 11 was in many ways an intellectual one. President [[George W. Bush]] tended to frame it that way: the attack was on our "values," and the "war against terror" was a war of ideas meant to advance the idea of freedom|Scott Malcomson.

{{quote|Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was the administration's epistemologist, worrying over the question of knowability; Bernard Lewis was its historian, Paul Wolfowitz its moralist in arms. That America's actions (as opposed to precautions) after 9/11 almost all took place far from home, with a professional army, strengthened this sense of abstraction. The possibility of anything like victory over our enemies was discounted early on (by Rumsfeld). Little wonder that, unlike in earlier wars, we have talked so much about what this conflict means, rather than simply working to end it as soon as possible|Scott Malcomson|September 7, 2011|''New York Times Magazine''}}

==Intellectual debates as wars of ideas==
Intellectual debates spiral into wars of ideas when academic concepts of neutrality and objectivity are abandoned and issues devolve into embittered and divisive disputes. Echevarria argued (2008) that in the United States topics such as [[abortion]], "[[intelligent design]]" and [[evolution]] are wars of ideas.&lt;ref name=Echevarriawarsideas /&gt; When an intellectual debate devolves into a war of ideas

{{quote|... [o]pposing sides seldom change their positions based on the introduction of new evidence, or new ways of evaluating existing evidence. Thus, wars of ideas are rarely settled on the merits of the ideas themselves. Instead, they tend to drag on, unless an event occurs that causes the belligerents to focus their attention elsewhere (Echevarria).|Strategic Studies Institute of the US Army War College (SSI)}}

Echarria uses &lt;ref name=Echevarriawarsideas /&gt; Kuhn's controversial incommensurability thesis &lt;ref name=Kuhn1962&gt;{{cite book |year=1962 |title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a claim to relativism and therefore a defense of engagement in the war of ideas. [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] (1922–1996) who is one of the most influential twentieth century philosophers of science published ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962) one of the most cited publications, in which he developed the thesis of incommensurability thesis, where he argued that "theories from differing periods suffer from certain deep kinds of failure of comparability" In &lt;ref name=Kuhn1962&gt;{{cite book |year=1962 |title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The central idea is that the development of science is driven by adherence to paradigms. If a particular paradigm cannot solve an anomaly, a crisis in science may result. An existing paradigm may be superseded by a rival paradigm. There may be no common measure for assessing the competing scientific theories. They are 'incommensurable'.&lt;ref name=SEPKuhn&gt;{{cite web |title=Thomas Kuhn |author=Alexander Bird |year=2011 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common misinterpretation of paradigms is the belief that the discovery of [[paradigm shift]]s and the dynamic nature of science (with its many opportunities for subjective judgments by scientists) are a case for [[relativism]]:&lt;ref&gt;Sankey, Howard (1997) "Kuhn's ontological relativism," in ''Issues and Images in the Philosophy of Science: Scientific and Philosophical Essays in Honour of Azarya Polikarov'', edited by Dimitri Ginev and Robert S. Cohen. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1997. Boston studies in the philosophy of science, vol. 192, pp. 305-320. {{ISBN|0792344448}}&lt;/ref&gt; the view that all kinds of belief systems are equal.  Kuhn vehemently denies this interpretation and states that when a scientific paradigm is replaced by a new one, albeit through a complex social process, the new one is ''always better'', not just different.

These claims of [[relativism]] are, however, tied to another claim that Kuhn does at least somewhat endorse: that the language and theories of different paradigms cannot be translated into one another or rationally evaluated against one another &amp;mdash; that they are ''incommensurable''. This gave rise to much talk of different peoples and cultures having radically different worldviews or conceptual schemes &amp;mdash; so different that whether or not one was better, they could not be understood by one another. However, the [[philosopher]] [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] published a highly regarded essay in 1974, "On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme" (''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', Vol. 47, (1973-1974), pp.&amp;nbsp;5–20) arguing that the notion that any languages or theories could be incommensurable with one another was itself incoherent. If this is correct, Kuhn's claims must be taken in a weaker sense than they often are.  Furthermore, the hold of the Kuhnian analysis on [[social science]] has long been tenuous with the wide application of multi-paradigmatic approaches in order to understand complex human behaviour (see for example John Hassard, ''Sociology and Organization Theory: Positivism, Paradigm and Postmodernity''. Cambridge University Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0521350344}}.)

==In U.S. politics==

{{quote|The extreme and asymmetric partisan polarization that has evolved over several decades, initially reflecting increasing ideological differences but then extending well beyond issues that ordinarily divide the parties to advance strategic electoral interests, fits uneasily with a set of governing institutions that puts up substantial barriers to majority rule. To improve that fit—either by producing less polarized combatants or by making political institutions and practices more responsive to parliamentary-like parties—we as a people need to think about ambitious reforms of electoral rules and governing arrangements. The former can include, for example, focusing more on the demand side of campaign finance than on the supply side. |Thomas E. Mann and Norm Ornstein (2012)}}

==In US foreign policy==

There are two principal schools of thought on how to approach the war of ideas. The first approach advocates treating the conflict as a matter best addressed through [[public diplomacy]]—defined as the conveyance of information across a broad spectrum to include cultural affairs and political action. Accordingly, this view calls for revitalizing or transforming the [[U.S. Department of State]] and many of the traditional tools of [[Public relations|statecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=866 Dr. Antulio J. Echevarria, WARS OF IDEAS AND THE WAR OF IDEAS], p.26&lt;/ref&gt;  This school of thought contends that American public diplomacy declined after the Cold War, as evidenced by the demise of the [[U.S. Information Agency]] in 1999, and the reduction or elimination of [[Strategic Communication|strategic communications]] programs such as "[[Voice of America]]," and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]. The remedy, then, according to this view, is to re-engage the world, especially the Arab-Muslim world, by revitalizing both the form and content of U.S. public diplomacy and strategic communications, and by reinforcing those communications with concrete programs that invest in people, create opportunities for positive exchanges, and help build friendships. In fact, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and its Iraqi component, [[Radio Free Iraq]], and [[Al-Hurra]] TV are now actively participating in U.S. strategic communication efforts, though with debatable effectiveness; all this has occurred, in part, by taking resources from Voice of America.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Curtis, "Efforts to Deal with America's Image Abroad: Are They Working?" Testimony before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight, April 26, 2007, p. 6.[http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/35034.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In direct contrast, the second school of thought advocates treating the war of ideas as a "real war," wherein the objective is to destroy the influence and credibility of the opposing ideology, to include neutralizing its chief proponents. This approach sees [[public diplomacy]] as an essential, but insufficient tool because it requires too much time to achieve desired results, and does little to aid the immediate efforts of combat forces in the field. For this school of thought, the principal focus of the war of ideas ought to be how to use the ways and means of [[information warfare]] to eliminate terrorist groups.&lt;ref&gt;Walid Phares, "The War of Ideas: Jihadism against Democracy,"(New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007); Waller, "Fighting the War of Ideas"; Zeyno Baran, "Fighting the War of Ideas," Foreign Affairs,Vol. 84, No. 6, November/December 2005, pp. 68–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use during the Cold War==
[[File:Chile quema libros 1973.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Book burnings in Chile]] following the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|1973 coup]] that installed the [[Military government of Chile (1973–1990)|Pinochet regime]]. Note the painting with a [[Che Guevara]] portrait being burned.]]
According to Dr. John Lenczowski, former Director of European and Soviet Affairs for the National Security Council during the Reagan administration, 'The Cold War took many forms, including proxy wars, the arms race, nuclear blackmail, economic warfare, subversion, covert operations and the battle for men's minds.  While many of these forms had the trappings of traditional conflicts of national interests, there was a dimension to the Cold War that made it unique among wars: it centered around a war of ideas—a war between two alternative political philosophies.''&lt;ref&gt;Dr. John Lenczowski,[http://www.phillysoc.org/lenctex.htm ''Emboldening Domestic Resistance to Communism: Presidential Rhetoric and the War of Information and Ideas Against the Soviet Union'']&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], the United States and other Western powers developed a robust infrastructure for waging a ''war of ideas'' against the [[communist]] ideology being promulgated by the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies. During the Truman and Eisenhower administrations, the so-called golden age of U.S. propaganda, counterpropaganda, and public diplomacy operations, the U.S. government carried out a sophisticated program of overt and covert activities designed to shape public opinion behind the [[Iron Curtain]], within European intellectual and cultural circles, and across the developing world.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1131"&gt;William Rosenau,[http://www.rand.org/pubs/reprints/2006/RAND_RP1218.pdf The RAND Corporation, “Waging the “war of Ideas,”](The McGraw-Hill Homeland Security Handbook, Chapter 72, pp. 1131–1148, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The United States was able to reach as much as 50–70% of the populations behind the Iron Curtain during the 1950s through their international broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Gough,[http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/gough.pdf ‘‘The Evolution of Strategic Influence,’’] USAWC [U.S. Army War College] Strategy Research Project, Carlisle Barracks, Pa. (April 7, 2004), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; High-level interest in such operations waned during the 1970s, but received renewed emphasis under President Ronald Reagan, the ''Great Communicator,'' who, like Eisenhower, was a firm advocate of the informational component of America's Cold War strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Gough,[http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/gough.pdf ‘‘The Evolution of Strategic Influence,’’PP.20–24]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with the end of the Cold War official interest once again plummeted. During the 1990s, Congress and the executive branch disparaged informational activities as costly Cold War anachronisms. The budget for State Department informational programs was slashed, and [[USIA]], a quasi-independent body that reported to the secretary of state, was disestablished, and its responsibilities were transferred to a new undersecretary of state for public diplomacy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1131"/&gt;

==Use in the War on Terror==

Terrorism is a form of political and psychological warfare; it is protracted, high-intensity propaganda, aimed more at the hearts of the public and the minds of decision makers, and not at the physical victims.&lt;ref&gt;J. Michael Waller, Fighting the War of Ideas like a Real War (The Institute of World Politics Press,2007), p.20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; There is growing recognition among U.S. government officials, journalists, and analysts of terrorism that defeating al-Qaida— arguably the preeminent challenge to U.S. security—will require far more than ''neutralizing'' leaders, disrupting cells, and dismantling networks.&lt;ref&gt;William Rosenau,[http://www.rand.org/pubs/reprints/2006/RAND_RP1218.pdf The RAND Corporation, “Waging the “war of Ideas,”] (The McGraw-Hill Homeland Security Handbook, Chapter 72, pp. 1131–1148, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[9/11 Commission]] concluded in its final report, eliminating al-Qaida as a formidable danger ultimately requires ''prevailing in the longer term over the ideology that gives rise to Islamist terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States,[http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf The 9/11 Commission Report] (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 2004), p. 363.
&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Akbar Ahmed]], a Muslim scholar who holds the Chair of Islamic Studies at American University, explains: Properly understood, this is a war of ideas within Islam—some of them faithful to authentic Islam, but some of them clearly un-Islamic and even blasphemous toward the peaceful and compassionate Allah of the Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;J. Michael Waller, Fighting the War of Ideas like a Real War,  Washington, DC: The Institute of World Politics Press, 2007, p. 68. [http://jmw.typepad.com/political_warfare/files/War_of_Ideas_Waller.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Americans, in general, are fundamentally opposed waging what seems as a blatantly ideological struggle seems quite unnatural to Americans and other Westerners, who tend to downplay intangible factors such as ideas, history, and culture as political motivators, preferring instead to stress relatively more concrete driving forces such as personal security and physical well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Carnes Lord, ''The Psychological Dimension in National Strategy,'' in Frank R. Barnett and Carnes Lord (eds.), Political Warfare and Psychological Operations(Washington, D.C.: National Defense University Press, 1989): 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States military has recently begun incorporating a strategic communication into their overall battle operations in the [[War on Terror]], especially in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].  In addition to the military's traditional role of using force they are beginning to use political as well as [[ideological]] warfare against the enemy as a method of influencing the local populations into opposing say the [[Taliban]] or [[al Qa'ida]]. The ancient Chinese philosopher [[Sun Tzu]] once said that to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Sun Tzu, Art of War, http://suntzusaid.com/book/3&lt;/ref&gt; The War of Ideas attempts to  "break the enemy's resistance."

==Terrorists' use of mass media==

Users of terror tactics' strategic communications goals are aimed at legitimizing, propagating, and intimidating their audience. Their skilful use of the mass media and the internet has enabled them to keep generating new generations of followers.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Carsten Bockstette, "Jihadist Terrorist Use of Strategic Communication Management Techniques" http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/MCDocs/files/College/F_Publications/occPapers/occ-paper_20-en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaida's message, disseminated widely and effectively through all forms of mass media, including the Internet, has a powerful appeal in much of the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous [Michael Scheuer], Imperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror (Washington: Brassey's, 2004), pp. 209–12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, an al-Qaeda spokesman described Osama bin Laden's strategic [[influence of mass media]] in the Arab world:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sheikh Usama knows that the media war is not less important than the military war against America. That's why al-Qaeda has many media wars. The Sheikh has made al-Qaeda's media strategy something that all TV stations look for. There are certain criteria for the stations to be able to air our videos, foremost of which is that it has not taken a previous stand against the mujahedeen. That maybe explains why we prefer Al-Jazeera to the rest.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Gendron,[http://www.itac-ciem.gc.ca/pblctns/tc_prsnts/2007-2-eng.asp Trends in Terrorism Series: Al-Qaeda: Propaganda and Media Strategy](2007) ITAC Presents Vol. 2007-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Media and the internet enable terrorists to thrive in a cancerous manner in the freedom that democracies provide. The intensive, sometimes obsessive coverage in the media about a terrorist act generates the desired psychological effect. Terrorist actions are planned and organized in a manner that causes a strategically maximum communicative effect, while requiring minimal resources. The symbiotic relationship between terror events and the media is apparent: the perpetrators would have far less impact without media publicity and the media can hardly be expected to resist reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Elihu &amp; Liebes, Tamar, "'No More Peace!' How Disaster, Terror and War have Upstaged Media Events." International Journal of Communication (2007), 157–166.http://ijoc.org/ojs/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/44/23&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite TV and the internet offers terrorists expanded possibilities of influencing and manipulating audiences.

==Terrorist media publication companies==

Terrorist groups are utilizing mass media, particularly the internet, to win the "War of Ideas" because their inability to win a traditional head-to-head war against a military force.

==Methods==

For instance in the West's battle against jihadist terrorists:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ensuring one's own credibility while undermining the jihadists' credibility is one of the key elements to winning this battle. It is possible to counteract the three primary terroristic communication goals, the propagation and enlargement of their movement, the legitimization of their movement and the coercion and intimidation of their enemies. Next to eliminating root causes and alleviating the underlying conditions, motivators and enablers of terrorism, such as terrorists' physical bases, developing an effective counter strategic communication plan, which exploits weaknesses and contradictions in the jihadists' use of strategic communication techniques, is vital in winning the asymmetrical conflict with jihadist terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Carsten Bockstette |title=Jihadist Terrorist Use of Strategic Communication Management Techniques |page=5 |url=http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/MCDocs/files/College/F_Publications/occPapers/occ-paper_20-en.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2996">The '''Warsaw School''' was a group of [[Poland|Polish]] [[history of ideas|historians of ideas]] active in the late 1950s and the 1960s. It was headed by [[Bronisław Baczko]] and [[Leszek Kołakowski]] and also included scholars such as [[Andrzej Walicki]], [[Jerzy Szacki]] and [[Krzysztof Pomian]]. 

Members of the group had institutional ties with the PAN Institute of Philosophy and Sociology and the Department of History of Modern Philosophy of the [[University of Warsaw]] headed by Baczko and Kołakowski.&lt;ref name="Śpiewak"/&gt;{{rp|87}} Critical of orthodox Marxism and the policies of the [[Polish United Workers Party]] (which they both were members of), Baczko and Kołakowski became inconvenient figures for the Polish authorities. On 21 October 1966, Kołakowski and Krzysztof Pomian gave formal speeches at a debate at the Faculty of History of the University of Warsaw where they openly criticised the ten-year rule of the [[Władysław Gomułka|Gomułka cabinet]] for incompetence, restrictions placed on [[freedom of speech]], and the absence of democratic institutions in Poland. Pomian and Kołakowski were immediately expelled from the Communist party,&lt;ref name="Śpiewak"/&gt;{{rp|89}} followed by Baczko in 1968. The Warsaw School fully disintegrated in the wake of the [[1968 Polish political crisis|March 1968 political crisis]]. Members of the group were involved in supporting students affected by reprisals in the aftermath of the riots, and many emigrated to escape persecution.&lt;ref name="Śpiewak"/&gt;{{rp|104}}

==Ideas and methods==
The methods used by members of the Warsaw School were varied, and some have argued that it was more a social grouping of intellectuals than a school of thought. However, certain shared characteristics can be found in works written by the group's members. The School held a researcher is supposed to place himself outside of the investigated subject&lt;ref name="Śpiewak"/&gt;{{rp|42}} valued objectivity, pluralism and the political independence of science.&lt;ref name="Śpiewak"/&gt;{{rp|47}} Their methodology borrowed from [[Marxism]], [[hermeneutics]], German [[sociology of knowledge]], [[existentialism]] and elements of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]' [[structuralism]]&lt;ref name="Śpiewak"&gt;Śpiewak Paweł, "W pół drogi. Warszawska Szkoła Historyków Idei", ''Więź'' 1981, No. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40–43}} and aimed to describe historical phenomena without making statements about their truth or falsity. They believed ideologies (including, controversially, Marxism) to be the products of the historical conditions of their times, in contrast to the [[historical materialist]] idea that mental structure is solely a derivative of social class. They were also interested in individual, religious and group ideologies and emphasised that history was a product of individual humans.

'''World Kindness Day''' is an [[international observance]] on [[13 November]].  It was introduced in 1998 by the [[World Kindness Movement]], a coalition of nations' kindness [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]. It is observed in many countries, including [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[Nigeria]] and [[United Arab Emirates]]. In 2009, [[Singapore]] observed the day for the first time.  [[Italy]] and [[India]] also observed the day. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it is fronted by [[David Jamilly]], who co-founded [[Kindness Day UK]]. In 2010 at the request of Michael Lloyd-White, the NSW Federation Parents and Citizens Association wrote to the Minister of The NSW Department of Education to place World Kindness Day on the NSW School Calendar. In 2012 At the request of the Chairman of World Kindness Australia, World Kindness Day was placed on the Federal School Calendar and the then Minister of School Education, Early Childhood, and Youth. The Hon [[Peter Garrett]] provided a Declaration of Support for World Kindness Australia and placed World Kindness Day on the National School Calendar for over 9000 schools. Schools across the globe are now celebrating World Kindness Day and work with local NGOs such as the Be Kind People Project and [[Life Vest Inside]] In the USA. In 2012 in Australia, [[Marie Bashir]], Governor of NSW, hosted an event for the first time at [[Government House, Sydney|Government House]] to celebrate World Kindness Day and accepted a Cool To Be Kind Award from year 3&amp;4 students. Australian Councils representing over 1.3 million residents have also signed Declarations of Support for World Kindness Australia placing World Kindness Day on the Council Calendar of Events. Events include THE BIG HUG, handing out Kindness Cards, Global Flashmob, which was coordinated by [[Orly Wahba]] from USA which was held in 15 countries and 33 cities with its images of the event making the big screens in [[New York City]]. [[Canada]] celebrates with The Kindness Concert and in Singapore in 2009, 45,000 yellow [[flower]]s were given away. In 2017 World Kindness day was also celebrated in [[Slovenia]], organised by volunteering organisation Humanitarcek as part of their project Randomised Kindess.

World Kindness Day is to highlight good deeds in the community focusing on the positive power and the common thread of kindness which binds us. Kindness is a fundamental part of the [[human condition]] which bridges the divides of race religion, politics, gender and zip codes. Kindness Cards are also an ongoing activity which can either be passed on to recognize an act of kindness and or ask that an act of kindness be done. Approaches are being made to the [[United Nations]] by the peak global body, the World Kindness Movement, to have World Kindness Day officially recognized and its members unanimously sign a Declaration of Support for World Kindness.

According to [[Gulf News]], "it is a day that encourages individuals to overlook boundaries, race and religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/general/gulf-news-readers-celebrate-world-kindness-day-1.526824|title=Gulf News readers celebrate World Kindness Day|last=Al Theeb|first=Alia|date=November 13, 2009|work=Gulf News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
