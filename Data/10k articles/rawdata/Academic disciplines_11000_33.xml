The bar indicates 1 cm. Electrophoresis performed overnight at less than 10&amp;nbsp;V/cm. The analysis was performed early in the 1970s at the Protein Laboratory]]

'''Affinity electrophoresis''' is a general name for many analytical methods used in [[biochemistry]] and [[biotechnology]]. Both qualitative and quantitative information may be obtained through affinity electrophoresis. The methods include the so-called [[electrophoretic mobility shift assay]], charge shift electrophoresis and affinity [[capillary electrophoresis]]. The methods are based on changes in the [[electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] pattern of molecules (mainly [[macromolecules]]) through biospecific interaction or [[complex formation]]. The interaction or binding of a molecule, charged or uncharged, will normally change the electrophoretic properties of a molecule. Membrane proteins may be identified by a shift in mobility induced by a charged [[detergent]]. [[Nucleic acid]]s or nucleic acid fragments may be characterized by their affinity to other molecules. The methods have been used for estimation of [[binding constant]]s, as for instance in [[lectin]] affinity electrophoresis or characterization of molecules with specific features like [[glycan]] content or [[ligand]] binding. For enzymes and other ligand-binding proteins, one-dimensional electrophoresis similar to counter electrophoresis or to [[immunoelectrophoresis|"rocket immunoelectrophoresis"]], affinity electrophoresis may be used as an alternative quantification of the protein. Some of the methods are similar to [[affinity chromatography]] by use of immobilized [[ligands]].

== Types and methods ==
Currently, there is ongoing research in developing new ways of utilizing the knowledge already associated with affinity electrophoresis to improve its functionality and speed, as well as attempts to improve already established methods and tailor them towards performing specific tasks.

=== Agarose gel electrophoresis ===
[[File:Figure displaying gel electrophoresis.png|thumb|an example of an agarose gel after electrophoresis]]
A type of electrophoretic mobility shift assay (AMSA), agarose gel electrophoresis is used to separate protein-bound amino acid complexes from free amino acids. Using a low voltage (~10&amp;nbsp;V/cm) to minimize the risk for heat damage, electricity is run across an agarose gel.

=== Rapid agarose gel electrophoresis ===
This technique utilizes a high voltage ({{nowrap|≥ 20 V/cm}}) with a 0.5× Tris-borate buffer run across an agarose gel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Rapid agarose gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay for quantitating protein: RNA interactions
|vauthors=Ream JA, Lewis LK, Lewis KA|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=511|date=October 2016|pp=36–41|doi=10.1016/j.ab.2016.07.027|pmid=27495142|pmc=5002362}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method differs from the traditional agarose gel electrophoresis by utilizing a higher voltage to facilitate a shorter run time as well as yield a higher band resolution. Other factors included in developing the technique of rapid agarose gel electrophoresis are gel thickness, and the percentage of agarose within the gel.

=== Boronate affinity electrophoresis ===
Boronate affinity electrophoresis utilizes boronic acid infused acrylimide gels to purify NAD-RNA. This purification allows for researchers to easily measure the kinetic activity of NAD-RNA decapping enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Boronate affinity electrophoresis for the purification and analysis of cofactor-modified RNA|journal=Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affinity capillary electrophoresis ===
Affinity capillary electrophoresis utilizes a formulary approach in accordance with the theory of electromigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Affinity capillary electrophoresis: the theory of electromigration|vauthors=Dubský P, Dvořák M, Ansorge M|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry|volume=408|issue=30|pp=8623–8641|pmid=27558099|doi=10.1007/s00216-016-9799-y|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method utilizes the inter-molecular interactions found in a free solution. "Affinity probes" consisting of fluorophore-labeled molecules that will bind to target molecules are mixed with the sample being tested. This mixture and its subsequent complexes are then separated through capillary electrophoresis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aizpurua-Olaizola|first=Oier|last2=Sastre Torano|first2=Javier|last3=Pukin|first3=Aliaksei|last4=Fu|first4=Ou|last5=Boons|first5=Geert Jan|last6=de Jong|first6=Gerhardus J.|last7=Pieters|first7=Roland J.|title=Affinity capillary electrophoresis for the assessment of binding affinity of carbohydrate-based cholera toxin inhibitors|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/elps.201700207/abstract|journal=Electrophoresis|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1002/elps.201700207|issn=1522-2683}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle behind this type of electrophoresis is the mobility of the target molecules being altered by inter-molecular interactions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kinoshita|first=Eiji|last2=Kinoshita-Kikuta|first2=Emiko|last3=Koike|first3=Tohru|date=2015-03-18|title=The Cutting Edge of Affinity Electrophoresis Technology|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2227-7382/3/1/42|journal=Proteomes|volume=3|issue=1|pages=42–55|doi=10.3390/proteomes3010042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affinity-trap polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ===
Affinity-trap polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) has become one of the most popular methods of protein separation. This is not only due to its separation qualities, but also because it can be used in conjunction with a variety of other analytic methods, such as mass spectrometry, and western blotting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This method utilizes a two-step approach. First, a protein sample is run through a polyacrylamide gel using electrophoresis. Then, the sample is transferred to a different polyacrylamide gel (the affinity-trap gel) where affinity probes are immobilized. The proteins that do not have affinity for the affinity probes pass through the affinity-trap gel, and proteins with affinity for the probes will be "trapped" by the immobile affinity probes. These trapped proteins are then visualized and identified using mass spectrometry after in-gel digestion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Phosphate affinity electrophoresis ===
Phosphate affinity electrophoresis utilizes an affinity probe which consists of a molecule that binds specifically to divalent phosphate ions in neutral aqueous solution, known as a "Phos-Tag". This methods also utilizes a separation gel made of an acrylamide-pendent Phos-Tag monomer that is copolymerized. Phosphorylated proteins migrate slowly in the gel compared to non-phosphorylated proteins. This technique gives the researcher the ability to observe the differences in the phosphorylation states of any given protein.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Marxism|Variants}}

The '''Budapest School''' ({{lang-hu|Budapesti iskola}}; {{lang-de|Budapester Schule}}) was a [[school of thought]], originally of [[Marxist humanism]], but later of [[Post-Marxism]] and dissident [[Liberalism]] that emerged in [[Hungary]] in the early 1960s, belonging to so called Hungarian New Left. Its members were students or colleagues of [[Georg Lukács]]. The school was originally oriented towards developing Lukacs' later works on [[social ontology]] and [[aesthetics]], but quickly began to challenge the paradigm of Lukacsian-Marxism, thus reconstructing contemporary critical theory.  Most of the members later came to abandon [[Marxism]]. The School also critiqued the "dictatorship over needs" of the Soviet states. Most of the members were forced into exile by the pro-Soviet Hungarian government.

In a letter to the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' of February 15, 1971, Georg Lukács drew attention to “The Budapest School of Marxism,” and helped attract attention to the school from [[Western Marxism]].

Members of the school include [[Ágnes Heller]], [[Ferenc Fehér]] [[:hu:Fehér Ferenc (filozófus)|(hu)]], [[György Márkus]], [[István Mészáros (professor)|István Mészáros]], [[Mihály Vajda]] and [[Maria Márkus]], among others. The Budapest School's writings have been read and researched widely since the 1960s.

==History==
The [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] was one of the most important political events of Agnes Heller's life, for at this time she saw the effect of the academic freedoms of Marxist [[critical theory]] as dangerous to the entire political and social structure of Hungary. The uprising confirmed Heller’s ideas that what [[Karl Marx|Marx]] really intended is for the people to have political autonomy and collective determination of social life.

Lukács, Heller and other Marxist critical theorists emerged from the Revolution with the belief that Marxism and [[socialism]] needed to be applied to different nations in individual ways, effectively questioning the role of the [[History of the Soviet Union (1953-1985)|Soviet Union]] in Hungary’s future. These ideas set Heller on an ideological collision course with the new Moscow-supported government of [[János Kádár]]: Heller was again expelled from the Communist Party and she was dismissed from the University in 1958 for refusing to indict Lukács as a collaborator in the Revolution. She was not able to resume her research until 1963, when she was invited to join the Sociological Institute at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences|Hungarian Academy]] as a researcher (Tormey 4–18) (Grumley 5–15). 
   
From 1963 can be seen the emergence of what would later be called the “Budapest School”, a philosophical forum that was formed by Lukács to promote the renewal of Marxist criticism in the face of [[actually existing socialism]] and its theories. Other participants in the Budapest School included together with Heller her second husband Ferenc Fehér, György Márkus, Mihály Vajda and some other scholars with looser connections to the school (such as [[András Hegedüs]], [[István Eörsi]], [[János Kis]] and [[György Bence]]). The School emphasized the idea of the renaissance of Marxism, described by radical philosophy scholar [[Simon Tormey]] as "a flowering of the critical, oppositional potential they believed lay within Marxism and in particular within the ‘early Marx’ ... the Marxism of the individual ‘rich in needs,' of solidarity and self-governance ... they hoped to precipitate a crisis in those systems that had the temerity to call themselves 'socialist'."

Heller’s work from this period, concentrates on themes such as what Marx means to the character of modern societies; liberation theory as applied to the individual; the work of changing society and government from “the bottom up,” and affecting change through the level of the values, beliefs and customs of "everyday life". Since 1990, Heller has been more interested in the issues of aesthetics in ''The Concept of The Beautiful'' (1998), ''Time Is Out of Joint'' (2002), and ''Immortal Comedy'' (2005).

The Budapest School carried out research on the Political Economy of both the Soviet Union and Western Capitalism. The School accepted many of the critiques of Soviet planning and inefficiency from [[Neoclassical Economics]], as well as the connection between markets and freedom. The Soviet system was condemned as a dictatorship over needs. The school also analyzed the [[mixed economies]] of modern capitalism. Most traditional Marxist economics was jettisoned. [[Economy of Sweden|Sweden]] and the [[Nordic Model]] was held as a model of the mixed economy and managed capitalism. The School advocated Radical Democracy as a solution to the authoritarian and undemocratic features of the mixed economy.

==Ágnes Heller==

Heller was born in 1929. It is well known that she is the most prominent philosopher and aesthetician from Budapest School, and one of the most representative critical theorists from Eastern European Neo-Marxists. She has published more than forty books on social theory, the theory of history, the philosophy of ethics and moral and political philosophy. Since 1990s, she has been paying more attention to issues of aesthetics.

==Mihály Vajda==
Mihály András Vajda is a [[Széchenyi Prize]]-winning Hungarian philosopher, professor, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, full member. His work is primarily in the phenomenology of the 20th-century German philosophy and theory in totalitarian societies. Between 1996 and 2000 the Kossuth Lajos University Institute of Philosophy, 2005 to 2009, the Institute for Philosophical Research Director.

He graduated from high school in 1953, and began his tertiary studies at the Lenin Institute. He studied there until 1956, then from 1957 to 1960 he attended and graduated from the Eötvös Loránd University of Sciences, Faculty of Philosophy, German Philosophy faculty. György Lukács accepted among students, the School of Budapest belonged.

Upon completion of undergraduate studies he worked as a primary school teacher, and in 1961, became a scientific assistant at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Institute of Philosophy. In 1967 he defended his candidate's dissertation in the philosophy of science. Gradually departed from the Marxist eszmétől, and in 1973 the Budapest school's role in respect of political incompetence and szabadúszóvá dismissed from the institute became a translator and worked as a language teacher. In 1977, Bremen has been a visiting professor, he lectured until 1980. In the 1980s, more than once was in New York visiting professor. 1991-1992 in Siegen, Kassel in 1994 as a teacher.

In 1989, rehabilitated, and in 1990 the Kossuth Lajos University (now University of Debrecen), senior lecturer in the Department of Philosophy University professor was appointed. In 1992 he defended his doctoral thesis. In 1994, the MTA Representative Assembly, and in 2000 became chairman of the Committee of the Institute of Philosophy, and in 2001 he was elected to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, e-mail, and in 2007 a full member. Between 1999 and 2002 Széchenyi fellowship researched. 2005 emeritálták . Also in 2005, the Institute for Philosophical Research was appointed. The institute is headed by 2009.

Research areas at the beginning of his career, the 20th-century phenomenology, [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Max Scheler]]'s work, he later turned to social theory.
In this period of fascism until 1995, his book is not jelentethette Hungarian. In the 1970s, towards a critical Marxist written works, most of which are also not jelentethetett it. The regime, the possibility of post-modern philosophy, and the impossibility of questions employed. Furthermore, dealt with philosophy, history and political philosophy.
He published a work in which he compared [[Husserl]]'s theory of the sedimentation of the European sciences with Lukacs' concept of [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]].

More than eighty publications, they are mainly in Hungarian, English and German disclose to the public.

He is married with a son and a daughter.

==István Mészáros==

'''István Mészáros''' is a Hungarian [[Marxist]] philosopher, and [[Professor Emeritus]] at the [[University of Sussex]]. He held the Chair of Philosophy at Sussex for fifteen years and was earlier Professor of Philosophy and Social Science for four years at [[York University]].

He can be linked to the so-called "Budapest school", a group of Hungarian philosophers who were taught or influenced by Georg Lukács, including Ágnes Heller and György Márkus.

He left his native Hungary in 1956 after the [[Soviet invasion of Hungary|Soviet invasion]] and worked for a time in [[Turin]], [[Italy]] before settling in the [[UK]].

This in turn allows one to determine the distance to the star, by comparing its known luminosity to its observed brightness.

The term ''Cepheid'' originates from [[Delta Cephei]] in the constellation [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]], identified by [[John Goodricke]] in 1784, the first of its type to be so identified.

Cepheid variables are divided into two subclasses which exhibit markedly different masses, ages, and evolutionary histories: [[Classical Cepheid variable|classical Cepheid]]s and [[type II Cepheid]]s.  [[Delta Scuti variable]]s are A class stars on or near the main sequence at the lower end of the [[instability strip]] and were originally referred to as dwarf Cepheids.  [[RR Lyrae variable]]s have short periods and lie on the instability strip where it crosses the [[horizontal branch]].  Delta Scuti variables and RR Lyrae variables are not generally treated with Cepheid variables although their pulsations originate with the same helium ionisation [[kappa mechanism]].

===Classical Cepheids===
{{main|Classical Cepheid variable}}
Classical Cepheids (also known as Population I Cepheids, type I Cepheids, or Delta Cepheid variables) undergo pulsations with very regular periods on the order of days to months.  Classical Cepheids are [[Population I]] [[variable star]]s which are 4–20 times more massive than the Sun,&lt;ref name=turner96&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1996JRASC..90...82T |title=The Progenitors of Classical Cepheid Variables |author1=Turner, David G. |volume=90 |date=1996 |pages=82 |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up to 100,000 times more luminous.&lt;ref name=turner10&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=0912.4864 |bibcode=2010Ap&amp;SS.326..219T |doi=10.1007/s10509-009-0258-5 |title=The PL calibration for Milky Way Cepheids and its implications for the distance scale |date=2010 |last1=Turner |first1=David G. |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |volume=326 |issue=2 |pages=219–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Cepheids are yellow bright giants and supergiants of [[spectral classification|spectral class]] F6 – K2 and their radii change by (~25% for the longer-period [[HD 84810|I Carinae]]) millions of kilometers during a pulsation cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1957MNRAS.117...85R |title=Radius variation and population type of cepheid variables |author1=Rodgers, A.

A group of classical Cepheids with small amplitudes and [[sinusoidal]] light curves are often separated out as Small Amplitude Cepheids or s-Cepheids, many of them pulsating in the first overtone.

===Type II Cepheids===
{{main|Type II Cepheid}}
Type II Cepheids (also termed Population II Cepheids) are [[population II]] variable stars which pulsate with periods typically between 1 and 50 days.&lt;ref name=wallerstein02&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2002PASP..114..689W |doi=10.1086/341698 |title=The Cepheids of Population II and Related Stars |date=2002 |last1=Wallerstein |first1=George |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |volume=114 |issue=797 |pages=689–699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=so08&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=0811.3636 |bibcode=2008AcA....58..293S |title=The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment.

Type II Cepheids are divided into several subgroups by period.  Stars with periods between 1 and 4 days are of the [[BL Herculis variable|BL Her subclass]], 10–20 days belong to the [[W Virginis variable|W Virginis subclass]], and stars with periods greater than 20 days belong to the [[RV Tauri variable|RV Tauri subclass]].&lt;ref name=wallerstein02/&gt;&lt;ref name=so08/&gt;

===Anomalous Cepheids===
A group of pulsating stars on the instability strip have periods of less than 2 days, similar to [[RR Lyrae variable]]s but with higher luminosities.  Anomalous Cepheid variables have masses higher than type II Cepheids, RR Lyrae variables, and our sun.  It is unclear whether they are young stars on a "turned-back" [[horizontal branch]], [[blue straggler]]s formed through [[mass transfer]] in binary systems, or a mix of both.&lt;ref name=caputo&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2004A&amp;A...424..927C|title=Bright metal-poor variables: Why ''Anomalous'' Cepheids?|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=424|issue=3|pages=927|author1=Caputo|first1=F.|last2=Castellani|first2=V.|last3=Degl'Innocenti|first3=S.|last4=Fiorentino|first4=G.|last5=Marconi|first5=M.|year=2004|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20040307|arxiv = astro-ph/0405395 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sosznytski&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2008AcA....58..293S|title=The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment.

==History==
On September 10, 1784, [[Edward Pigott]] detected the variability of [[Eta Aquilae]], the first known representative of the class of classical Cepheid variables.  However, the eponymous star for classical Cepheids is [[Delta Cephei]], discovered to be variable by [[John Goodricke]] a few months later.

A relationship between the period and luminosity for classical Cepheids was discovered in 1908 by [[Henrietta Swan Leavitt]] in an investigation of thousands of variable stars in the [[Magellanic Clouds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1908AnHar..60...87L |title=1777 variables in the Magellanic Clouds |author1=Leavitt, Henrietta S. |volume=60 |date=1908 |pages=87 |journal=Annals of Harvard College Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt; She published it in 1912&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1912HarCi.173....1L |title=Periods of 25 Variable Stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud |author1=Leavitt, Henrietta S. |author2=Pickering, Edward C. |volume=173 |date=1912 |pages=1 |journal=Harvard College Observatory Circular}}&lt;/ref&gt; with further evidence.

In 1913, [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]] conducted research on Cepheids. His research would later require revision, however. In 1915, [[Harlow Shapley]] used Cepheids to place initial constraints on the size and shape of the [[Milky Way]], and of the placement of our Sun within it. In 1924, [[Edwin Hubble]] established the distance to classical Cepheid variables in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], until then known as the ''Andromeda'' [[Spiral galaxy#Spiral nebula|''Nebula'']], and showed that the variables were not members of the Milky Way.  Hubble's finding settled the question raised in the "[[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]]" of whether the Milky Way represented the entire Universe or was merely one of numerous [[Galaxy|galaxies]] in the Universe.&lt;ref name=hubble1925&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1925Obs....48..139H |title=Cepheids in spiral nebulae |author1=Hubble, E. P. |volume=48 |date=1925 |pages=139 |journal=The Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Hubble and [[Milton L. Humason]] formulated what is now known as [[Hubble's Law]] by combining Cepheid distances to several galaxies with [[Vesto Slipher]]'s measurements of the speed at which those galaxies recede from us. They discovered that the Universe is expanding (see the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the Universe]]).  However, the expansion of the Universe was posited several years before by [[Georges Lemaître]].&lt;ref name=lemaitre1927&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1927ASSB...47...49L|title=Un Univers homogène de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des nébuleuses extra-galactiques|journal=Annales de la Société Scientifique de  Bruxelles|volume=47|pages=49|author1=Lemaître|first1=G.|year=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 20th century, significant problems with the astronomical distance scale were resolved by dividing the Cepheids into different classes with very different properties.  In the 1940s, [[Wilhelm Heinrich Walter Baade|Walter Baade]] recognized two separate populations of Cepheids (classical and type II). Classical Cepheids are younger and more massive population I stars, whereas type II Cepheids are older fainter Population II stars.&lt;ref name="wallerstein02" /&gt; Classical Cepheids and type II Cepheids follow different period-luminosity relationships. The luminosity of type II Cepheids is, on average, less than classical Cepheids by about 1.5 [[Absolute magnitude|magnitudes]] (but still brighter than [[RR Lyrae variable|RR Lyrae]] stars).   Baade's seminal discovery led to a fourfold increase in the distance to [[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]], and the extragalactic distance scale.&lt;ref name=baade&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1958AJ.....63..207B|title=Problems in the determination of the distance of galaxies|journal=Astronomical Journal|volume=63|pages=207|author1=Baade|first1=W.|year=1958|doi=10.1086/107726}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RR Lyrae variable|RR Lyrae stars]], then known as Cluster Variables, were recognized fairly early as being a separate class of variable, due in part to their short periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1918CMWCI.153....1S|title=No. 153.

==Uncertainties in Cepheid determined distances==
Chief among the uncertainties tied to the classical and type II Cepheid distance scale are: the nature of the period-luminosity relation in various [[passband]]s, the impact of [[metallicity]] on both the zero-point and slope of those relations, and the effects of photometric contamination (blending) and a changing (typically unknown) extinction law on Cepheid distances.  All these topics are actively debated in the literature.&lt;ref name=tammannsandage2008&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=0806.3018 |bibcode=2008A&amp;ARv..15..289T |doi=10.1007/s00159-008-0012-y |title=The expansion field: the value of H 0 |date=2008 |last1=Tammann |first1=G.

==Dynamics of the pulsation==
The accepted explanation for the pulsation of Cepheids is called the '''Eddington valve''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=
	1984S&amp;T....68..519S|title=
	Eddington's Valve and Cepheid Pulsations|journal=Sky and Telescope|volume=
	68|pages=
	519|author1=
	Smith|first1=
	D. H.|year=
	1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''[[κ-mechanism]]''', where the Greek letter κ (kappa) denotes gas opacity.
[[Helium]] is the gas thought to be most active in the process. Doubly [[ionization|ionized]] helium (helium whose atoms are missing both electrons) is more opaque than singly ionized helium.  The more helium is heated, the more ionized it becomes. At the dimmest part of a Cepheid's cycle, the ionized gas in the outer layers of the star is opaque, and so is heated by the star's radiation, and due to the increased temperature, begins to expand. As it expands, it cools, and so becomes less ionized and therefore more transparent, allowing the radiation to escape. Then the expansion stops, and reverses due to the star's gravitational attraction. The process then repeats.

The mechanics of the pulsation as a heat-engine was proposed in 1917 by [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1917Obs....40..290E |title=The pulsation theory of Cepheid variables |author1=Eddington, A. S. |volume=40 |date=1917 |pages=290 |journal=The Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt; (who wrote at length on the dynamics of Cepheids), but it was not until 1953 that [[Sergei Alexandrovich Zhevakin|S. A. Zhevakin]] identified ionized helium&lt;ref&gt;Zhevakin, S. A., "К Теории Цефеид. I", ''Астрономический журнал'', 30 161–179 (1953)&lt;/ref&gt; as a likely valve for the engine.

Crossing the floor may be voting against the approved party lines, or changing to another party after being elected while a member of a first party. While these practices are legally permissible, crossing the floor can lead to controversy and media attention. As well, voting against party lines may lead to consequences such as losing a position (e.g., as minister or a portfolio critic) or being ejected from the party caucus.  [[Maldives]] and [[Bangladesh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/sections_detail.php?id=367&amp;sections_id=24624 |title= Article 70(b) of Constitution of People's Republic of Bangladesh}}&lt;/ref&gt; have laws which removes the member from parliament due to floor-crossing.

==Etymology==
The term originates from the [[British House of Commons]], which is configured with the Government and [[Parliamentary Opposition|Opposition]] facing each other on rows of benches. In consequence, an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] who switches from the governing party to one in opposition (or vice versa) also changes which side of the chamber they sit on. A notable example of this is [[Winston Churchill]], who crossed the floor from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] to the [[Liberal party (UK)|Liberals]] in 1904, before later crossing back in 1924.

==Voting against party lines==
The term has passed into general use in other [[Westminster System|Westminster]] parliamentary democracies (such as [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], [[Politics of Australia|Australia]], [[Politics of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Politics of South Africa|South Africa]]) even if many of these countries have semicircular or horseshoe-shaped debating chambers and mechanisms for voting without [[Members of Parliament]] leaving their seats. In most countries, it is most often used to describe members of the government party or parties who defect and vote with the opposition against some piece of government-sponsored legislation, but that usage is not widespread in Canada, where the term's usage is restricted to the original definition.

Most political parties let their members have a free vote on some matters of personal conscience.

In Australia, one of the major parties (the [[Australian Labor Party]]) requires its members to pledge their support for the collective decisions of the Caucus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22library%2Fprspub%2F31KH6%22 |title=Crossing the floor in the Federal Parliament 1950 – August 2004 |work=Research Note no. 11 2005–06 |publisher=Australian Parliament |date=October 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; which theoretically prohibits them from crossing the floor; however, in practice, some Labor members disregard this pledge despite the disciplinary action which may result. Among other parties, crossing the floor is rare although former Senator [[Barnaby Joyce]] of the [[National Party of Australia]] crossed the floor 19 times under the Howard coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/independently-inclined-20080530-2jzv.html?page=2 |title=Independently inclined |publisher=The Age |first=Penelope |last=Debelle |date=May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the record for crossing the floor in the Australian Parliament goes to Tasmanian Senator Sir [[Reg Wright]], who voted against his own party (the [[Liberal Party of Australia]]) on 150 occasions.

==Changing parties==
In the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries, the term is also used to describe leaving one's party entirely and joining another party, such as leaving an opposition party to support the government (or vice versa), or even leaving one opposition party to join another. In both Canada and the United Kingdom, the term carries only this meaning and is not used for a simple vote against the party line on a bill.

In April 2006, the premier of [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]], [[Gary Doer]] of the [[New Democratic Party of Manitoba]], proposed a ban on crossing the floor of the Manitoba legislature in response to "the concern some voters have expressed over the high-profile defections of three federal MPs from their parties in just over two years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/cityguides/reddeer/story.html?id=3d05619e-313e-4cce-a7a2-f5beed56b228&amp;k=3864 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323022203/http://www.canada.com/cityguides/reddeer/story.html?id=3d05619e-313e-4cce-a7a2-f5beed56b228&amp;k=3864 |archivedate=March 23, 2007|title=Proposed reforms would ban floor-crossing in Man. |first=Michelle |last=Macafee |publisher=Canadian Press |date=April 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting legislation, which amended the provincial ''Legislative Assembly Act'', mandated that Members of the Legislature who quit their political party must serve out the remainder of their term as independents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/2006/c01506ee.php |title=The Elections Reform Act - Schedule E |work=Statutes of Manitoba |publisher=Manitoba Laws |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extraordinary example occurred in Alberta, Canada in December 2014 when [[Danielle Smith]], the leader of the official opposition [[Wildrose Party]], and eight of her MLAs crossed the floor together to join the governing [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;http://globalnews.ca/news/1737886/danielle-smiths-move-to-pcs-unprecedented/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Divided consciousness''' is a term coined by [[Ernest Hilgard]] to define a psychological state in which one's [[consciousness]] is split into distinct components, possibly during [[hypnosis]].

== Origin(s) ==
The theory of a division of consciousness was touched upon by [[Carl Jung]] in 1935 when he stated, "The so-called unity of consciousness is an illusion... we like to think that we are one but we are not."&lt;ref&gt;(Review: Dissociationism Revived, Matthew Hugh Erdelyi, Science, New Series, Vol. 200, No. 4342 (May 12, 1978), pp. 654-655; Published by: American Association for the Advancement of Science)&lt;/ref&gt;  Ernest Hilgard believed that hypnosis causes a split in awareness and a vivid form of everyday mind splits.&lt;ref&gt;(Myers, David G. Psychology:  Eighth Edition in Modules. New York, NY: Worth Publishers, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;   Drawing themes from [[Pierre Janet]], Hilgard viewed hypnosis from this perspective as a willingness to divide the main systems of consciousness into different sectors.  He argued that this split in consciousness can not only help define the state of mind reached during hypnosis, but can also help to define a vast range of psychological issues such as [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]].

In Hilgard's ''Divided Consciousness Reconsidered'', he offers a great many examples of "[[dissociation (psychology)|dissociated]]" human behavior. With regard to theory, he does state that it is useful to assign two modes of consciousness, a receptive mode and an active mode—that is, a bimodal consciousness. In other places he mentions the concept of ''coconsciousness'', wherein two or more states of consciousness may be equally receptive or active, as, for example, in some types of multiple personality.&lt;ref&gt;Huebner, B. (1979). Distributing cognition: A defense of collective mentality,'' Journal of Psycholinguistic Research, 8 (6)'',591;  Retrieved from http://www.springerlink.com/content/h66jn31642t052j8/fulltext.pdf?page=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Many psychological studies assume a unity of consciousness. Doubt is cast on this assumption by psychophysical studies in normal subjects and those with [[blindsight]] showing the simultaneous dissociation of different modes of report of a sensation, and by clinical studies of [[anosognosia|anosognosic]] patients showing dissociations of awareness of their own states.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These and other phenomena are interpreted to imply two kinds of division of consciousness: the separation of phenomenal experience from reflexive consciousness and the non-unity of reflexive consciousness. Reflexive consciousness is taken to be necessary for report and is associated with the self as the subject of experience and agent of report. Reflexive consciousness is operative only when we attend to our own states. When we are involved in the world reflexivity intervenes less and our consciousness is more unified.&lt;ref&gt;Hebb, D, Juzyck, P, Klein R.,(1983). The Nature of Thought, '' Medical Research Council, Applied Psychology Unit, Cambridge, UK.'' Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?id=0cprqzSe6BkC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=By+Donald+Olding+Hebb,+Peter+W.+Jusczyk,+Raymond+M.+Klein&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N_f-8zNr2K&amp;sig=dBHDyYyDKSCTQ4YohMjalD85fxY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA32,M1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimentation ==
The theory has been tried and tested and some tests have proven that the theory makes some legitimate predictions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  Others, such as one performed on 169 undergraduate students, some of whom performed tasks in [[selective attention]] and divided attention conditions being correlated with scores on the [[Hypnotic susceptibility#Harvard Group Scale|Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility]] refute Hilgard’s findings.&lt;ref&gt;Some operationalizations of the neodissociation concept and their relationship to [[hypnotic susceptibility]]. Stava, Lawrence J.; Jaffa, Melvyn. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Vol 54(6), Jun 1988, 989-996.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

New trends in psychology and [[cognitive neuroscience]] suggest that applications of [[nonlinear dynamics]], chaos and [[self-organization]] seem to be particularly important for research of some fundamental problems regarding mind-brain relationship. Relevant problems among others are formations of memories during alterations of mental states and nature of a barrier that divides mental states, and leads to the process called [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]]. This process is related to a formation of groups of [[neuron]]s which often synchronize their firing patterns in a unique spatial manner. The central theme of this study is the relationship between level of moving and oscillating [[mental process]]es and their [[neurophysiological]] substrate. This presents a question about principles of organization of the conscious experience and how the experiences happen in the brain. Chaotic self-organization provides a unique theoretical and experimental tool for deeper understanding of dissociative phenomena and enables to study how dissociative phenomena can be linked to [[epilepsy|epileptiform]] discharges which are related to various forms of psychological and somatic manifestations. Organizing principles that constitute human consciousness and other mental phenomena from this point of view may be described by analysis and reconstruction of underlying dynamics of psychophysiological measures.&lt;ref&gt;Chaos, brain and divided consciousness.

'''Domestic drama''' expresses and focuses on the realistic everyday lives of [[middle-class|middle or lower classes]] in a certain society, generally referring to the post-[[Renaissance]] eras. According to the ''English Communications Syllabus'', domestic drama refers to a dramatic story containing an emphasis on its “characters' intimate relationships and their responses to [the] unfolding events in their lives.” The characters, their lives, and the events that occur within the show are usually classified as 'ordinary' events, lives, and characters, but this does not limit the extent of what domestic drama can represent. Domestic drama does, however, take the approach in which it “concerns people much like ourselves, taken from the lower and middle classes of society, who struggle with everyday problems such as poverty, sickness, crime, and family strife.” 

==Roots==
Domestic is derived from the Latin domus, or home. The word domestic is defined as “of or relating to the household.” [[Drama]] receives the definition of “A prose or verse composition, especially one telling a serious story, that is intended for representation by actors impersonating the characters and performing the dialogue and action,” and it is derived from the Greek word drao, to act or to take action. The combination of both domestic and drama provides a literal translation of “a serious story relating to the household,” clearly a synonymous definition to the given definition provided by the English Communications Syllab

==Development and History==
Dramatic works have nearly always contained a sense of domestic drama within its fundamental plot line.&lt;ref&gt;{{answers.com|drama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the early ages of [[Greek drama]], there has been a sense of ordinary people's struggles with their lives (though this cannot be classified as domestic drama due to the incorporation of the Greek gods interfering with the common people and the enabling of the common people to have “godlike” attributes). [[Medieval theatre]] tended to express religious themes within their shows with miracles and the creation of [[morality play]]s, in which the shows were used as religious allegories. Though not yet emphasizing the ordinary lives, the development of dramatic works is slowly working towards more realistic plot lines, one of the essential elements in domestic drama.
[[History of theatre#Renaissance theatre|Renaissance theatre]] marks the arrival of [[pastoral drama]], drama referring to the relationships of the [[peasant|rustics]]. Though this describes the events of 'ordinary people', the shows tended to stretch realism, focussed mainly on the [[romantic relationship]]s of the rustics, and were decorated with an emphasis on the [[comedic]] aspect of theater. Pastoral drama was considered to be more successful than the traditional [[comedy|comedies]] and [[tragedy|tragedies]], enforcing the further development into domestic drama.

Drama in the late seventeenth century consisted of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] comedies focusing on the comedic relationships within the [[upper class]]es. This era also consisted of the [[Restoration drama]] and placed an emphasis on the usage of [[poetry|poetic language]], “sensational incidents, and epic personages” within the show. These styles of shows are not considered domestic dramas because they focus on the relationships of the higher classes, as opposed to the middle or lower classes. This further develops into domestic drama as the plot lines become more realistic and centered around [[Fictional character|character]]s' relationships and their actions towards each other.

The eighteenth century marks the arrival of domestic drama as the shows start focusing on the problems of the ordinary people. The early eighteenth century playwrights used domestic drama to express the “trend toward sentimental [[bourgeois]] realism.” These new domestic dramas also incorporated realistic comedies of fairly sophisticated characterizations [with] middle-class [[morality]]. These early domestic dramas are classified as part of the Romantic era of all types of arts.

[[Image:Ibsen-Dresden01.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Portrait of a younger Henrik Ibsen, one of the first playwrights to adapt domestic drama into his works.]]Nineteenth century drama took the complete step in incorporating [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] into drama, thus resulting in more serious and [[philosophical]] drama. Characters and [[Setting (fiction)|setting]]s gradually developed into the realistic truths of the current society. Along with realism was [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]]: “selective realism emphasizing the more sordid and pessimistic aspects of life.” This movement of combined realism and naturalism gave way to the “slice-of-life” shows commonly synonymous with domestic drama. One outstanding playwright of this era was [[Henrik Ibsen]] of [[Norway]]. His frequent usage of realism within his shows “brought to a climax the realistic movement of the nineteenth century and also served as a bridge to twentieth century symbolism.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com, section 7 paragraph 5&lt;/ref&gt; Ibsen used middle-class characters dealing with his complex plots and “surpassed other such works” of his time. Playwrights such as Ibsen have drawn much attention to domestic drama and have brought this method to its high significant stature in modern theatrical works.

The twentieth century introduced [[symbol]]ism into the makings of domestic dramas, ultimately causing variations within domestic drama. Early twentieth century shows incorporated such [[psychological device]]s as “minimal scenery, telegraphic dialogue, talking machines, and characters portrayed as types rather than individuals.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com
section 8 paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic drama suddenly became a combination of [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], [[expressionism]], symbolism, and commonly used psychological affairs. The classification of domestic dramas became unclear as shows challenged new ideas and created a difficulty in determining the [[illusion]]s and [[Realism (arts)|realism]] of a show.

Modern dramas usually revolve around [[psychological]], [[social]], and [[political]] affairs, all of which seem to have their roots in domestic drama. Modern works also use interpretive ideas, such as “distinctive voice and vision, stark settings, austere language in spare dialog, meaningful silences, the projection of a powerful streak of menace, and outbursts of real or implied violence.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com section 8 paragraph 9&lt;/ref&gt;  The utensils of dramatic works have greatly expanded, but all still carry the roots of domestic drama. Domestic drama also carries the implications of current affairs with society: such as [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]], [[feminism]], and current political and sociological disputes. Current domestic drama itself tends to express the “war-at-home” style of theater, whereas twentieth century domestic drama could be classified as [[experimental theater]] or [[symbolic theater]].

==Audience Appeal==
Domestic drama tends to appeal to the audience because most of the audience can relate to the events within a domestic drama. The audience is appealed to this style of drama in four ways: empathy, humor, suspense, and resolution of the issues. This group of spectators can empathize with the domestic drama at hand because the domestic drama touches incidents that are common to the 'ordinary' people. Many playwright use the audience's empathy to manipulate the proposed expression of the show. David Williamson's “Brilliant Lies” uses “domestic unit battling” to create sympathy from the audience as they are confronted with the issue.
Humor provides the entertainment value within a domestic drama as these usually touch base with serious matters. The entertainment value of a show keeps the people engaged without having to continually use serious turns of events in order to maintain an audience's interest.
Suspense provides “dramatic irony” as the audience indulges itself within the characters' situation and privacy of their backgrounds. Suspense is used in a domestic drama in order for the audience to react with the characters of the show. This “[positions] the audience to feel privileged and therefore involved with the unfolding drama.”
As in all shows, an audience expects a resolution to the conflict within a show. Domestic dramas drive the show to its resolution to keep the audience desiring to reach the climax. Domestic dramas use such a technique that is very similar to the style of modern soap operas.

==Text==
The text of a domestic drama follows a specific guideline in order to stay within this genre: subject, structure, and language. By deviating from this guideline too excessively, the classification as a domestic drama becomes problematic.
The subject of a domestic drama must be that of the 'ordinary' people. The audience (generally 'ordinary') needs to connect with the characters of the domestic drama, and the plot must the following the “[[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]]” of “traditional families, urban family units, or domestic households.” The subject of the domestic drama could also imply to relationships at a workplace as this does relate to the 'ordinary' events of 'ordinary' people. The subjects of concern could vastly range from poverty to family strife, from civil rights to economic injustices. Due to the audience relationship with the material of the domestic drama, most domestic dramas are most successful in the society in which the plot is direct towards because the audience is most familiar with the culture of the show.
Domestic dramas follow a fairly linear structure and generally have a sort of patriarchal figure as a representative of the family. This patriarchal figure provides the guidelines of the everyday nature of the subjects of the show. Confrontations with the patriarchal figure are also a common structure within domestic dramas.
The language used in a domestic drama generally relates with the 'ordinary' subjects of a show to reinforce the “realistic impression” of the show onto and audience. The usage of a specific language enables a specific audience to further connect with the subjects of the domestic drama as language is an “intimate personal way of communicating.”

==Social expression==
Theater has been commonly used as a public expression of the humanitarian affairs of a certain era. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth era, drama expressed the ideals of the caste and court system, with nobility on high and rustics down low. This expression gave way to the public in order to see and understand how this system was to work within their society. Some might say that theater has played a very important role in the shaping of societies when used in this way. Nineteenth century induced the importance of the middle-class within drama and introduced the role of the bourgeois and the usage of aristocratic entertainment. The political aspects of a certain era were inevitably present within these shows, especially shows leading towards domestic drama. Theater was considered to have “good [socially] position” characters against the immoral acts of society, usually a sort of infringement against a certain code of behavior. Theater was the way to explain the rights and wrongs of a certain lifestyle in a society, especially if the characters were of the 'ordinary' people so that the audience could relate with the characters. Modern drama changed this aspect of theater as it was not directed towards any one class in society, but rather the collaboration of the artistic aspects within these classes. Such a combination created much difficulty in domestic drama as domestic drama appeals to a specific class.

[[File:Sickergrube.jpg|thumb|Old drywell.]]
A '''dry well''' or '''drywell''' is an underground structure that disposes of unwanted [[water]], most commonly [[surface runoff]] and [[stormwater]], and in some cases [[greywater]]. It is a covered, porous-walled chamber that allows water to slowly soak into the ground (that is, [[percolation|percolate]]), dissipating into the [[groundwater]]. Such structures are often called a '''soakaway''' in the United Kingdom, a '''soakwell''' in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Jacques|title=Environmentalist|url=http://www.soakwells.com/whatis.html|publisher=Perth Soakwells Pty Ltd|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a '''soak pit''' in India. 

A [[sump]] in a [[basement]] can be built in drywell form, allowing the [[sump pump]] to cycle less frequently (handling only occasional peak demand). A [[French drain]] can resemble a horizontal dry well that is not covered. A larger open pit or artificial [[swale (landform)|swale]] that receives storm water and dissipates it into the ground is called an [[infiltration basin]] or recharge basin. In places where the amount of water to be dispersed is not as large, a [[rain garden]] can be used instead. 

A dry well is a passive structure.  Water flows through it under the influence of gravity.  A dry well receives water from one or more entry pipes or channels at its top and discharges the same water through a number of small exit openings distributed over a larger surface area in the side(s) and bottom of the dry well.  When a dry well is above the [[water table]], most of its internal volume will contain air.  Such a dry well can accept an initial inrush of water very quickly, until the air is displaced.  After that, the dry well can only accept water as fast as it can dissipate water.  Some dry wells deliberately incorporate a large storage capacity, so that they can accept a large amount of water very quickly and then dissipate it gradually over time, a method that is compatible with the intermittent nature of [[rainfall]].  A dry well maintains the connection between its inflow and outflow openings by resisting collapse and resisting clogging.

Simple dry wells consist of a pit filled with [[gravel]], [[riprap]], [[rubble]], or other [[debris]]. Such pits resist collapse, but do not have much storage capacity because their interior volume is mostly filled by stone.  A more advanced dry well defines a large interior storage volume by a concrete or plastic chamber with perforated sides and bottom.  These dry wells are usually buried completely, so that they do not take up any land area.  The dry wells for a parking lot's storm drains are usually buried below the same parking lot.

A covered pit that disposes of the water component of sewage by the same principle as a dry well is called a [[cesspool]]. A [[septic drain field]] operates on the same slow-drain/large-area principle as an infiltration basin.

{{Economics sidebar}}

An '''economist''' is a practitioner in the [[social sciences|social science]] discipline of [[economics]].

The individual may also study, develop, and apply theories and concepts from economics and write about [[economic policy]]. Within this field there are many sub-fields, ranging from the broad [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[theory|theories]] to the focused study of minutiae within specific [[Market (economics)|market]]s, [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] analysis, [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] analysis or [[financial statement analysis]], involving analytical methods and tools such as [[econometrics]], [[statistics]], [[Computational economics|economics computational model]]s, [[financial economics]], [[mathematical finance]] and [[mathematical economics]].

==In academia==
The professionalization of economics, reflected in academia, has been described as "the main change in economics since around 1900."&lt;ref&gt;[[Orley Ashenfelter|O. Ashenfelter]] (2001), "Economics: Overview", The Profession of Economics, ''[[International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences]]'', v. 6, p. 4159.&lt;/ref&gt;  Economists debate the path they believe their profession should take.  It is, primarily, a debate between a scholastic orientation, focused on mathematical techniques, and a public discourse orientation, which is more focused on communicating to lay people pertinent economic principles as they relate to [[public policy]].  Surveys among economists indicate a preference for a shift toward the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first= William L. |title=Preference Falsification in the Economics Profession|date=August 2004|url=http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/DavisCharacterIssuesAugust2004.pdf|format=PDF|website=www.econjournalwatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most major universities have an economics faculty, school or department, where [[academic degree]]s are awarded in economics. Getting a PhD in economics takes six years, on average, with a median of 5.3 years.&lt;ref&gt;Siegried JF, Stock WA. (2001). [https://ideas.repec.org/p/van/wpaper/0037.html So You Want to Earn a Ph.D. in Economics: How Long Do You Think it Will Take?]. ''Journal of Human Resources''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]], established by [[Sveriges Riksbank]] in 1968, is a prize awarded to economists each year for outstanding intellectual contributions in the field of economics. The prize winners are announced in October every year. They receive their awards (a prize amount, a gold medal and a diploma) on December 10, the anniversary of [[Alfred Nobel]]'s death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/ |title=The Nobel Prize |accessdate=2008-03-14 |publisher=Nobel Web AB }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professions==
[[Image:Mvc-017x.jpg|thumb|[[Chairman of the Federal Reserve|Fed Chairman]] [[Alan Greenspan]] testifies before the [[U.S. House Committee on Financial Services]]]]
Economists work in many fields including academia, government and in the private sector, where they may also "...study data and statistics in order to spot trends in economic activity, economic confidence levels, and consumer attitudes. They assess this information using advanced methods in statistical analysis, mathematics, computer programming [and] they make recommendations about ways to improve the efficiency of a system or take advantage of trends as they begin."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonreview.com/cte/profiles/dayInLife.asp?careerID=56 Economist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to regulated professions such as engineering, law or medicine, there is not a legally required educational requirement or license for economists. In academia, to be called an economist requires a Ph.D. degree in Economics. In the US government, on the other hand, a person can be hired as an economist provided that they have a degree that included or was supplemented by 21 semester hours in economics and three hours in statistics, accounting, or calculus.&lt;ref name="http://www.opm.gov/qualifications/standards/IORs/gs0100/0110.htm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Economist Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A professional working inside of one of many fields of economics or having an academic degree in this subject is often considered to be an economist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/Life-Physical-and-Social-Science/Economists.htm|title=Economists :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bls.gov|publisher=|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to government and academia, economists are also employed in [[bank]]ing, [[finance]], [[accountancy]], [[commerce]], [[marketing]], [[management|business administration]], [[lobbying]] and non- or not-for profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ-jobs.com/|title=Economics Jobs and Economist Jobs - Econ-Jobs.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Politician]]s often consult economists before enacting economic [[policy]]. Many statesmen have academic degrees in economics.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==By country==
Economics [[Alumnus|graduate]]s are employable in varying degrees depending on the regional economic scenario and [[labour economics|labour market]] conditions at the time for a given country. Apart from the specific understanding of the subject, employers value the skills of numeracy and analysis, the ability to [[communication|communicate]] and the capacity to grasp broad issues which the graduates acquire at the [[university]] or [[college]]. Whilst only a few{{how many|date=July 2016}} economics graduates may be expected to become professional economists,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} many find it a base for entry into a career in [[finance]] – including accounting, insurance, tax and banking, or [[management]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} A number of economics graduates from around the world have been successful in obtaining employment in a variety of major national and international firms in the financial and commercial sectors, and in manufacturing, retailing and IT, as well as in the public sector – for example, in the health and education sectors, or in [[government]] and [[politics]]. Small numbers{{how many|date=July 2016}}{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} go on to undertake postgraduate studies, either in economics, research, teacher training or further qualifications in specialist areas.
===Brazil===
In Brazil, unlike most countries in the world where the profession is not regulated, the profession of Economist is regulated by Law. 1411 of August 13, 1951. The professional designation of economist, according to the said law, is exclusive to the bachelors in economics graduates in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Guia do mercado de trabalho do economista"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coreconrs.org.br/area-de-atuacao.html|title=Guia do mercado de trabalho do economista CORECON|accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Economists salary.png|thumb|300px|Economist salaries by educational attainment.&lt;ref name = "Pay Scale, US income of Economists"/&gt;]]
According to the [[United States Department of Labor]], there were about 15,000 non-academic economists in the United States in 2008, with a median salary of roughly $83,000 the top ten percent earning more than $147,040 annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos055.htm#earnings/ US Bureau of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430185238/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos055.htm#earnings/ |date=April 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 135 colleges and universities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AEA/gradstudents/Schools.htm|title=Subscription Application}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=June 2016}} grant around 900 new [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]s every year. Incomes are highest for those in the private sector, followed by the federal government, with academia paying the lowest incomes. As of January 2013, PayScale.com showed Ph.D. economists' salary ranges as follows: all Ph.D. economists, $61,000 to $160,000; Ph.D. corporate economists, $71,000 to $207,000; economics full professors, $89,000 to $137,000; economics associate professors, $59,000 to $156,000, and economics assistant professors, $72,000 to $100,000.&lt;ref name="Pay Scale, US income of Economists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Degree=Ph.D._Economics/Salary|title=Pay Scale, US income of Economists|accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The largest single professional grouping of economists in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] are the more than 1000 members of the [[Government Economic Service]], who work in 30 government departments and agencies.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Analysis of destination surveys for economics graduates from a number of selected top schools of economics in the United Kingdom (ranging from [[Newcastle University]] to the [[London School of Economics]]), shows nearly 80 percent in employment six months after graduation – with a wide range of roles and employers, including regional, national and international organisations, across many sectors.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} This figure compares very favourably with the national picture, with 64 percent of economics graduates in employment.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

'''Elephant hunting''', which used to be an accepted activity '''in Kenya''', was banned in 1973, as was the [[ivory trade]]. Illegal hunting continues, as there is still international demand for [[elephant tusks]]. [[Kenya]] pioneered the [[destruction of ivory]] as a way to combat this [[black market]]. [[Elephant]] [[poaching]] continues to pose a threat to the population.

==Colonial Kenya==
During colonial times, elephant hunting in Kenya was seen as a sport for noblemen and was exploited by the colonial governors.&lt;ref name="History1915"&gt;{{cite book|author=American Museum of Natural History|title=The American Museum journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=66seAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 May 2011|year=1915|publisher=American Museum of Natural History}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British East Africa]] was not unique in this: [[big-game hunting]] was popular in many parts of [[British Empire|the Empire]]. Among the [[white hunter]]s, the bull elephant was said to be the most exhilarating target. Small-bore [[rifle]]s appeared to be the preferred option and aiming at the brain instead of the heart was another preference. The motive was not always monetary. However, many hunters were indiscriminate in their choice of elephants to kill – young, old, male or female, it did not matter, as the primary purpose was ivory to sell and [[elephant meat]] to feed their hunting party.&lt;ref name="Steinhart2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinhart|first=Edward I.|title=Black poachers, white hunters: a social history of hunting in colonial Kenya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXaP-eY493cC&amp;pg=PA71|accessdate=6 May 2011|year=2006|publisher=James Currey|isbn=978-0-85255-960-4|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[East African Professional Hunter's Association]] was formed to regulate the industry and restrict its excesses. The Association, which came into being at the [[Fairmont The Norfolk Hotel|Norfolk Hotel]], Nairobi, stemmed from a desire to regulate hunting in the wake of technological developments like the safari vehicle, which had made accessing remote hunting areas much easier. During its existence it was able to accomplish much to conserve East African wildlife and become perhaps one of the most respected societies in the world of its kind.&lt;ref name=herne167&gt;{{cite book |title=White Hunters: The Golden Age of African Safaris |last=Herne |first=Brian |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1999 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company, LLC |location=New York |isbn= |page=167 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

One of the most prolific of the white hunters was the Scottish adventurer [[W. D. M. Bell]], who is reported to have killed over a thousand elephants, spread across several African countries. &lt;ref name="Barclay"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barclay|first=Edgar N|title=Big Game Shooting Records 1931|publisher=HF&amp;G Witherby|chapter=Chapter One - correspondence with WDM Bell and author}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the first of his memoirs, ''The Wanderings of an Elephant Hunter'' (1923), for more information. Some of the madness of the desire to shoot an elephant (albeit not in Kenya) is shown in ''[[White Hunter Black Heart]]'', a fictionalised version of what happened during the filming of the Hollywood classic ''[[The African Queen (film)|African Queen]]''.

In 1963, the [[History_of_Kenya#Independence|first year of independence]], the [[government of Kenya|Kenyan government]] issued 393 permits ([[hunting license]]s) for elephants.&lt;ref name="McNickle2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=McNickle|first=Dan|title=Teaching and Hunting in East Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zdSHVaGcCwsC&amp;pg=PT275|accessdate=6 May 2011|date=19 March 2004|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4120-1935-4|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1950s and 1960s, the Kenyan poacher received approximately Shs. 3-4/lb ($.79–1.05/kg); by the 1970s, it was Shs. 100/kg ($12.74/kg), increasing the black market value for the primary producer from about one-fifth to one-third of the real value.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas-Hamilton, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ban, and ivory smuggling==
According to the American hunter [[Craig Boddington]], elephant hunting was made illegal in Kenya in 1973 and all animal hunting without a permit in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsafield.com/notes-from-afield/africas-elephant-explosion|title=Africa's elephant explosion|publisher=Sportsafield|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the late 1970s, the elephant population was estimated around 275,000, dropping to 20,000 in 1989.&lt;ref name="ifaw.org2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifaw.org/Publications/Program_Publications/Elephants/asset_upload_file236_12046.pdf |title=Elephants on the High Street |date=March 2004 |publisher=International Fund for Animal Welfare |pages=18 |accessdate=9 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928081306/http://www.ifaw.org/Publications/Program_Publications/Elephants/asset_upload_file236_12046.pdf |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1970 and 1977, Kenya lost more than half of its elephants.&lt;ref name="savetheelephants.org1979"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:aVmYNQzzD6wJ:www.savetheelephants.org/files/pdf/publications/1979%2520Douglas-Hamilton%2520African%2520Elephant%2520Ivory%2520Trade%2520Study.pdf+kenya+elephant+ivory&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjXA_YT_db_nctmmbthPos3ND898AdycIwZxSwqAQrLb1EIJtiFy256vXYlu78njDGIelvBtUYi8MCWD2QDoME2zD-lemLDTFdcthjgS-0H2z4G-GbaepaVoeawZDsvloI2C8Ix&amp;sig=AHIEtbRtWTmA6gOHe3MIqyQSFH3bpPFppg|title=AFRICAN ELEPHANT IVORY TRADE STUDY  FINAL REPORT|first=I. |last=Douglas-Hamilton|date=August 1979|work=savetheelephants.org|pages=19|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s, [[Ngina Kenyatta]] (Mama Ngina), wife of then-President [[Jomo Kenyatta]], and other high-level government officials were allegedly involved in an ivory-smuggling ring that transported tusks out of the country in the state private aeroplane.&lt;ref name="Information1975"&gt;{{cite book|title=New Scientist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zE74f2fU1iwC&amp;pg=PA452|accessdate=8 May 2011|date=22 May 1975|publisher=Reed Business Information|page=452|issn=0262-4079}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonner1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonner|first=Raymond|title=At the hand of man: peril and hope for Africa's wildlife|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sXfwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 May 2011|year=1993|publisher=Knopf|isbn=978-0-679-40008-0|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Society1980"&gt;{{cite book|title=Animal kingdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oAEdAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 May 2011|year=1980|publisher=New York Zoological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wieland2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Munger1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Munger|first=Edwin S.|title=Touched by Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=06MMAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=8 May 2011|year=1983|publisher=Castle Press|isbn=978-0-934912-00-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''New Scientist'' claimed that there was now documentary proof that at least one member of "Kenya's royal family" (the Kenyatta) had shipped over six tons of ivory to China.&lt;ref name="Information1975"/&gt; 

In the 1970s, 1900 elephants were killed in Kenya for their ivory tusks, increasing to 8300 elephants in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Lowery1997" /&gt;

==The worldwide ban on ivory trade==

In 1989, as a dramatic gesture to persuade the world to halt the ivory trade, President [[Daniel arap Moi]] [[Destruction_of_ivory#Kenya_and_the_first_fire|ignited twelve tons of elephant tusks]].&lt;ref name="Perlez1989"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/19/world/kenya-in-gesture-burns-ivory-tusks.html|title=KENYA, IN GESTURE, BURNS IVORY TUSKS|last=Perlez|first=Jane|date=July 19, 1989|publisher=[[The New York Times]]  |accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1990s the widespread ban on commercial ivory trading reduced the industry to a fraction of what it had been and elephant populations have stabilised.&lt;ref name="Wieland2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wieland|first=Terry|title=A view from a tall hill: Robert Ruark in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CflNHBquJWAC&amp;pg=PA411|accessdate=6 May 2011|date=25 March 2004|publisher=Down East Enterprise Inc|isbn=978-0-89272-650-9|page=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; But illegal poaching and sale on the black market still poses a serious threat, as does government bribery. The largest poaching incident in Kenya since the ivory trade ban occurred in March 2002, when a family of ten elephants was killed.&lt;ref name="ifaw.org2004" /&gt;

Illegal elephant deaths decreased between 1990, when the [[CITES]] ban was issued, and 1997, when only 34 were illegally killed.&lt;ref name="Lowery1997"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/ted/ice/poach.htm|title=ICE Case Studies - CASE NUMBER: 33 - CASE MNEMONIC: POACH  - CASE NAME: Ivory Poaching |first=N. |last=Lowery |date=December 1997|publisher=[[American University]]|accessdate=9 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505054639/http://www1.american.edu/ted/ice/poach.htm |archive-date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivory seizures rose dramatically since 2006 with many illegal exports going to Asia.&lt;ref name="cnn.com2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-05-06/world/kenya.illegal.ivory_1_illegal-ivory-elephant-tusks-kenyan-elephants?_s=PM:WORLD |title=Kenya finds Illegal ivory in boxes disguised as diplomatic baggage |date=May 6, 2011 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=9 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513075330/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-05-06/world/kenya.illegal.ivory_1_illegal-ivory-elephant-tusks-kenyan-elephants?_s=PM%3AWORLD |archivedate=13 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poaching spiked seven-fold between 2007 and 2010.&lt;ref name="Straziuso2010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37167109/ns/world_news-world_environment/t/ivory-trade-threatens-african-elephant/|title=Ivory trade threatens African elephant |last=Straziuso|first=Jason |author2=Michael Casey |author3=William Foreman |date=2010-05-15|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Large scale tourism promotion picked up in Kenya following the imposed hunting ban in Kenya since 1977. It has been noted that "photographic tourism", or non-consumptive wildlife use, [[Tourism in Kenya|is contributing 12% of Kenya’s GDP]]. Hence, some groups have recommended that tourism be promoted rather than any kind of hunting or consumptive wildlife use, as it could divert the attention of the government of Kenya from the policy goal of wildlife preservation.&lt;ref name=sport&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bornfree.org.uk/campaigns/further-activities/trophy-hunting/|title=Shooting animals for ‘sport’|accessdate=8 May 2011|publisher=Bornfree.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Internet Archive Digital Library"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arkell-Hardwick|first1=Alfred|title=An ivory trader in North Kenia|date=1903|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co.|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/ivorytraderinnor00hard|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The current situation, including safari tourism==
[[File:Elephant576.JPG|thumb|An elephant skull with tusk removed by poachers near [[Voi]], [[Taita-Taveta District]].]]

Though elephant hunting has been banned for a 40-year period in Kenya, poaching has not reduced. Given the poverty of many of the people, and the high value of elephant tusks, they are shipped overseas and sold on the black market. Although Kenya has many national parks and reserves protecting wildlife, elephant populations are still at risk, a problem which is made worse by corruption and some officials supplementing their income with permitting poaching.&lt;ref name="AndersonGrove1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=David|last2=Grove|first2=Richard H.|title=Conservation in Africa: Peoples, Policies and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oclQ6rHRJAYC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=6 May 2011|date=25 May 1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-34990-1|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kenyan government has attempted to crack down on elephant poaching with the aid of multi-nationals but has often been too late in preventing the poaching of many elephants whose tusks have been seized ''en masse'' in cases at [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport|Nairobi Airport]] and in [[Suvarnabhumi Airport|Bangkok Airport]] where Kenyan tusks have often been imported.

Arrests continue at Nairobi's international airport, where 92 kilos{{clarify|reason=kilograms?|date=March 2014}} of raw ivory were seized in 2010, and 96 kilos{{clarify|reason=kilograms?|date=March 2014}} in 2011.&lt;ref name="voanews.com2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2011/04/29/kenya-seizes-traveler-carrying-elephant-ivory/ |title=Kenya Seizes Traveler Carrying Elephant Ivory |date=April 29, 2010 |publisher=Voice of America News |accessdate=9 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506152540/http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2011/04/29/kenya-seizes-traveler-carrying-elephant-ivory/ |archivedate=6 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual case that received publicity in 2014 was the death of [[Satao (elephant)|Satao]], one of the world's largest elephants, in the [[Tsavo Trust]]. Despite [[Kenya Wildlife Service]] guards, poachers managed to shoot the bull with a poisoned arrows and cut off his tusks.

==Possible trophy hunting in the future==
[[Trophy hunting]], purely as sport and as a conservation action, is now being considered for adoption in Kenya, as such a programme appears to have yielded positive results in Namibia and South Africa under a programme titled "Community-Based Natural Resource Management" (CBNRM). Under this programme, while cash was offered as an incentive for sport hunting, the basic aim was wildlife control on the communal land, providing benefits to the community as a whole.&lt;ref name=trophy&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conservationfinance.wordpress.com/2007/03/19/elephant-hunting/ |title=Elephant Hunting |accessdate=7 May 2011 |publisher=Conservation Finance |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813225940/http://conservationfinance.wordpress.com/2007/03/19/elephant-hunting/ |archivedate=13 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed{{By whom|date=October 2011}} that trophy hunting might attract elephant poachers into moving into legal hunting and leaving elephant trading.

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]'s (FAO) report states: "Trophy hunting is generally self-regulating because low off-take is required to ensure high trophy quality and marketability in future seasons. Trophy hunting creates crucial financial incentives for the development and/or retention of wildlife as a land use over large areas in Africa, including in areas where ecotourism is not viable. Hunting plays an important role in the rehabilitation of degraded wildlife areas by enabling the income generation from wildlife without affecting population growth of trophy species."&lt;ref name=hunting&gt;{{Cite web|url=fttp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/aj114e/aj114e09.pdf|format=pdf|title=Trophy Hunting In Sub Saharan Africa: Economic Scale and Conservation Significance|accessdate=7 May 2011|publisher=fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy of trophy hunting has been adopted in 23 sub-Saharan African countries. The income generated in total in Africa is quoted to be USD 201 million/year, derived from about 18,500 international hunting clients covering an area of 1.4 million km².&lt;ref name=hunting/&gt; Since there is a lack of consensus among the clients about the efficacy of this method of biodiversity conservation in Africa, a study carried out by the [[Africa Wildlife Conservation Fund]] indicates that if Kenya makes trophy hunting legal again, nearly 90% of the clients would be interested to pursue this activity in that country. In this context, the importance of effective regulation of hunting operators and clients has also been highlighted.&lt;ref name=fund&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.africanwildlifeconservationfund.org/Research_Team_at_African_Wildl/Romanach_Pubs/Potential%20of%20trophy%20hunting.pdf |format=pdf |title=Potential of trophy hunting to create incentives for wildlife conservation in Africa where alternative wildlife-based land uses may not be viable |pages=283, 286–287, 289 |accessdate=8 May 2011 |publisher=Africa Wildlife Conservation Fund |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517024606/http://www.africanwildlifeconservationfund.org/Research_Team_at_African_Wildl/Romanach_Pubs/Potential%20of%20trophy%20hunting.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the disadvantages of trophy hunting is the possible publicity backlash, such as [[Zimbabwe]] experienced with the [[killing of Cecil the lion]].

[[Image:LeafInsect.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A [[Phasmatodea|phasmid]], [[mimicry|mimicking]] a leaf]]
'''Entomology''' ({{ety|grc|''ἔντομον'' (entomon)|insect||''-λογία'' ([[wikt:-logia|-logia]])|study of}}&lt;ref name="Liddell 1980"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | isbn = 0-19-910207-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[science|scientific]] study of [[insect]]s, a branch of [[zoology]]. In the past the term "insect" was more vague, and historically the definition of entomology included the study of terrestrial [[animal]]s in other [[arthropod]] groups or other [[phylum|phyla]], such as [[arachnid]]s, [[myriapod]]s, [[earthworm]]s, [[land snail]]s, and [[slug]]s. This wider meaning may still be encountered in informal use.

Like several of the other fields that are categorized within [[zoology]], entomology is a [[taxon]]-based category; any form of scientific study in which there is a focus on insect-related inquiries is, by definition, entomology. Entomology therefore overlaps with a cross-section of topics as diverse as [[molecular genetics]], [[behavior]], [[biomechanics]], [[biochemistry]], [[systematics]], [[physiology]], [[developmental biology]], [[ecology]], [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], and [[paleontology]].

At some 1.3 million described [[species]], insects account for more than two-thirds of all known organisms,&lt;ref name="Chapman"&gt;{{cite book |author=Chapman, A. D. |year=2009 |edition=2 |title=Numbers of living species in Australia and the World |pages=60pp |publisher=Canberra: [[Australian Biological Resources Study]] |isbn=978-0-642-56850-2 |url=http://www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/publications/other/species-numbers/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; date back some 400 million years, and have many kinds of interactions with humans and other forms of life on earth.

==History==
[[File:TRES18481.jpg|thumb|Plate from ''Transactions of the Entomological Society'', 1848.]]
[[File:Compilation of 100 Trigonopterus species - 1742-9994-10-15-3.png|thumb|These 100 ''[[Trigonopterus]]'' species were described simultaneously using [[DNA barcoding]].]]
{{See also|Timeline of entomology}}

Entomology is rooted in nearly all human [[culture]]s from [[prehistoric]] times, primarily in the context of [[agriculture]] (especially [[biological control]] and [[beekeeping]]), but [[scientific]] study began only as recently as the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Saltini, ''Storia delle scienze agrarie'', 4 vols, Bologna 1984-89, {{ISBN|88-206-2412-5}}, {{ISBN|88-206-2413-3}}, {{ISBN|88-206-2414-1}}, {{ISBN|88-206-2415-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Kirby (entomologist)|William Kirby]] is widely considered as the father of Entomology. In collaboration with [[William Spence (entomologist)|William Spence]], he published a definitive entomological encyclopedia, ''Introduction to Entomology'', regarded as the subject's foundational text. He also helped to found the [[Royal Entomological Society]] in London in 1833, one of the earliest such societies in the world; earlier antecedents, such as the [[Aurelian (entomology)|Aurelian society]] date back to the 1740s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bq05ecMx-owC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27|title=Bugs and the Victorians|publisher=Yale University Press|author=Clark, John F.M.|year=2009|pages=26–27|isbn=0300150911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entomology developed rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries, and was studied by large numbers of people, including such notable figures as [[Charles Darwin]], [[Jean-Henri Fabre]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Karl von Frisch]] (winner of the 1973 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1973/frisch-lecture.html|title=Karl von Frisch - Nobel Lecture: Decoding the Language of the Bee|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two-time [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[E. O. Wilson]].

There has also been a history of people becoming entomologists through museum curation and research assistance,&lt;ref name="Starrs NMNH"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Starrs|first1=Siobhan|title=A Scientist and a Tinkerer – A Story in a Frame|url=http://nmnh.typepad.com/100years/2010/08/a-scientist-and-a-tinkerer-a-story-in-a-frame.html|website=National Museum of Natural History Unearthed|publisher=National Museum of Natural History|accessdate=19 March 2017|date=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Sophie Lutterlough]] at the Smithsonian [[National Museum of Natural History]]. Insect identification is an increasingly common hobby, with [[butterfly|butterflies]] and [[dragonfly|dragonflies]] being the most popular.

Most insects can easily be recognized to order such as Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants) or Coleoptera (beetles).  However, insects other than [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterflies]] and [[moth]]s) are typically identifiable to genus or species only through the use of [[Identification key]]s and [[Monograph]]s. Because the class [[Insecta]] contains a very large number of species (over 330,000 [[species]] of [[beetles]] alone) and the characteristics separating them are unfamiliar, and often subtle (or invisible without a [[microscope]]), this is often very difficult even for a specialist. This has led to the development of [[automated species identification]] systems targeted on insects, for example, [[Digital Automated Identification SYstem (DAISY)|Daisy]], ABIS, SPIDA and Draw-wing.

==In pest control==
In 1994, the Entomological Society of America launched a new [[professional certification]] program for the pest control industry called the Associate Certified Entomologist (ACE). To qualify as a "true entomologist" an individual would normally require an advanced degree, with most entomologists pursuing their PhD. While not true entomologists in the traditional sense, individuals who attain the ACE certification may be referred to as ACEs, Amateur Entomologists, or Associate Entomologists.

==Taxonomic specialization==
[[Image:Beetle collection.jpg|thumb|Part of a large [[beetle]] collection.]]

Many entomologists specialize in a single order or even a family of insects, and a number of these subspecialties are given their own informal names, typically (but not always) derived from the scientific name of the group:
* [[Coleopterology]] - [[beetle]]s
* [[Dipterology]] - [[flies]]
* [[Odonata|Odonatology]] - [[Odonata|dragonflies and damselflies]]
* [[Hemiptera|Hemipterology]] - [[Hemiptera|true bugs]]
* [[Isoptera|Isopterology]] - [[termite]]s
* [[Lepidoptera|Lepidopterology]] - [[moth]]s and [[butterfly|butterflies]]
* [[Melittology]] (or ''Apiology'') - [[bee]]s
* [[Myrmecology]] - [[ant]]s
* [[Orthopterology]] - [[grasshopper]]s, [[cricket (insect)|crickets]], etc.
* [[Trichoptera|Trichopterology]] - [[caddis flies]]
* [[Vespology]] - Social [[wasps]]

==Organizations==
Like other scientific specialties, entomologists have a number of local, national, and international organizations. There are also many organizations specializing in specific subareas.
* [[Amateur Entomologists' Society]]
* [[Deutsches Entomologisches Institut]]
* [[Entomological Society of America]]
* [[Entomological Society of Canada]]

An '''ethnoreligious group''' (or '''ethno-religious group''') is an [[ethnic group]] whose members are also unified by a common [[Religion|religious background]].

== Defining an ethnoreligious group ==

In general ethnoreligious communities define their ethnic identity not only by [[Ancestor|ancestral]] heritage nor simply by religious affiliation but normally through a combination of both. An ethnoreligious group has a shared history and a cultural tradition - which can be defined as religious - of its own. In many cases ethnoreligious groups are ethno-cultural groups with a traditional [[ethnic religion]]; in other cases ethnoreligious groups begin as communities united by a common faith which through [[endogamy]] developed cultural and ancestral ties.&lt;ref name="Yang and Ebaugh"&gt;Yang and Ebaugh, p.369: "Andrew Greeley (1971) identified three types of relationships in the United States: some religious people who do not hold an ethnic identity; some people who have an ethnic identity but are not religious; and cases in which religion and ethnicity are intertwined. Phillip Hammond and Kee Warner (1993), following Harold J. Abramson (1973), further explicated the “intertwining relationships” into a typology. First is “ethnic fusion,” where religion is the foundation of ethnicity, or, ethnicity equals religion, such as in the case of the Amish and Jews. The second pattern is that of “ethnic religion,” where religion is one of several foundations of ethnicity. The Greek or Russian Orthodox and the Dutch Reformed are examples of this type. In this pattern, ethnic identification can be claimed without claiming the religious identification but the reverse is rare. The third form, “religious ethnicity,” occurs where an ethnic group is linked to a religious tradition that is shared by other ethnic groups. The Irish, Italian, and Polish Catholics are such cases. In this pattern, religious identification can be claimed without claiming ethnic identification. Hammond and Warner also suggest that the relationship of religion and ethnicity is strongest in “ethnic fusion” and least strong in “religious ethnicity.” Recently, some scholars have argued that even Jews’ religion and culture (ethnicity) can be distinguished from each other and are separable (Chervyakov, Gitelman, and Shapiro 1997; Gans 1994)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammond and Warner"&gt;Hammond and Warner, p.59: "1. Religion is the major foundation of ethnicity, examples include the Amish, Hutterites, Jews, and Mormons. Ethnicity in this pattern, so to speak, equals religion, and if the religious identity is denied, so is the ethnic identity. [Footnote: In actuality, of course, there can be exceptions, as the labels "jack Mormon," "banned Amish," or "cultural Jew" suggest.] Let us call this pattern "ethnic fusion."&lt;br&gt;
2. Religion may be one of several foundations of ethnicity, the others commonly being language and territorial origin; examples are the Greek or Russian Orthodox and the Dutch Reformed. Ethnicity in this pattern extends beyond religion in the sense that ethnic identification can be claimed without claiming the religious identification, but the reverse is rare. Let us call this pattern "ethnic religion."&lt;br&gt;
3. An ethnic group may be linked to a religious tradition, but other ethnic groups will be linked to it, too. Examples include Irish, Italian, and Polish Catholics; Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish Lutherans. Religion in this pattern extends beyond ethnicity, reversing the previous pattern, and religious identification can be claimed without claiming the ethnic identification. Let us call this pattern "religious ethnicity""&lt;/ref&gt; The legal assignement what is an ethnoreligious group can differ from the above given definition.

Some ethnoreligious groups' identities are reinforced by the experience of living within a larger community as a distinct [[Minority group|minority]]. Ethnoreligious groups can be tied to [[ethnic nationalism]] if the ethnoreligious group possesses a historical base in a specific region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/84714/1/zef_dp72.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In many ethnoreligious groups emphasis is placed upon religious endogamy, and the concurrent discouragement of interfaith marriages or intercourse, as a means of preserving the stability and historical longevity of the community and culture.

=== The Jewish case ===
{{Main|Who is a Jew?|Beta Israel|Bene Israel}}

Prior to the [[Babylonian exile]] the [[Israelites]] had already emerged as an ethnoreligious group, probably before the time of [[Hosea]].&lt;ref name ="Sparks"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KztVonFGqcsC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=ethno+religious+israelites&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZ-feI6preAhWC24MKHfwtDLkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ethno%20religious%20israelites&amp;f=false | title = Ethnicity and Identity in Ancient Israel: Prolegomena to the Study of Ethnic Sentiments and Their Expression in the Hebrew Bible |author= Kenton L. Sparks|publisher =Eisenbrauns | year = 1998| pages = 146-148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 19th century [[Reform Judaism]] has adopted theology that differs from traditional Judaism, although in recent years the reform movement has readopted some traditional practices. By the end of the 20th century the reform movement had become dominant in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In the United States rising mixed marriage rates has lead to attempts to facilitate conversion of the spouse. Despite conversion in order to facilitate marriage being strongly discouraged by traditional Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/387726/jewish/Conversion-and-Marriage.htm&lt;/ref&gt; If the spouse does not convert the reform movement will recognize paternal descent. Traditional Jews only recognizes descent along the maternal line. Many children of mixed marriages do not identify as Jews and the reform movement only recognizes children of mixed marriages as Jewish if they "established through appropriate and timely public and formal acts of identification with the Jewish faith and people."&lt;ref&gt;https://reformjudaism.org/practice/ask-rabbi/how-does-reform-judaism-define-who-jew&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid 1960s Israeli national identity has become inexorably linked with Jewish identity.&lt;ref name ="Waxman"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oUHIAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=ethno+religious+jews&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3g_737JreAhUEnFkKHR-jAYwQ6wEIPjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=ethno%20religious%20jews&amp;f=false | title = The Pursuit of Peace and the Crisis of Israeli Identity: Defending/Defining the Nation | author= Waxman, Dov | publisher = Springer| year = 2006 | page = 115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title= Israelis Are Divided Over Whether They Are ‘Jewish’ Or ‘Israeli.’| url =https://forward.com/opinion/412732/israelis-are-conflicted-about-whether-they-are-jewish-or-israeli-heres/?attribution=home-top-story-1-headline | accessdate= 25 Oct 2018 | authors = Shlomo Fischer | magazine= Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years some [[anti-Zionist]]s have adopted a variety of theories intent on proving that contemporary Jews are descendants of converts. Which in their view would render [[Zionism]] a form of modern irrational racism. While at the same time severing Jewish ties to the Land of Israel.&lt;ref name ="Sharan"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1vdKDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT165&amp;dq=anti+zionist+deny+ethnic+shlomo+sand&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGptWZ8JreAhUkx1kKHY-JCb4Q6AEIVjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=anti%20zionist%20deny%20ethnic%20shlomo%20sand&amp;f=false | title = Crossovers: Anti-zionism and Anti-semitism |author= Shlomo Sharan, David Bukay |publisher = Routledge | year = 2017 | page = 161-163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel Jewish religious courts have authority over personal status matters which has lead to friction with secular Jews who sometimes find they must leave the country in order to marry or divorce. Particularly relating to the inherited status of [[mamzer]], the marriage of males from the priestly line, persons not recognized as Jewish by the rabbinate and [[Agunah|agunot]]. The Israeli rabbinate only recognizes certain approved Orthodox rabbis as legitimate which has lead to friction with Diaspora Jews who for centuries never had an overarching authority.

=== The Anabaptist case ===
{{Main|Ethnic Mennonite}}

Other classical examples for ethnoreligious groups are traditional [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] groups like the [[Amish|Old Order Amish]], the [[Hutterites]], the [[Old Order Mennonite]]s and traditional groups of [[Russian Mennonite|German speaking Mennonites from Russia]], like the [[Old Colony Mennonites]]. All these groups have a shared German background, a shared German dialect as their every day language ([[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]], [[Hutterite German|Hutterisch]], [[Plautdietsch]]) and a shared version of their Anabaptist faith, a shared history of several hundred years and they have accepted very few outsiders into their communities in the last 250 years. Modern proselytizing Mennonite groups, like e.g. the [[Evangelical Mennonite Conference]] whose members have lost their shared ancestry, their common ethnic language Plautdietsch, their traditional dress and other typical ethnic traditions, are not seen as ethnoreligious groups anymore.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Redekop: ''A People Apart: Ethnicity and the Mennonite Brethren'', 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Royden Loewen: ''The Poetics of Peoplehood: Ethnicity and Religion among Canada's Mennonites'' in Paul Bramadat, David  Seljak: Christianity and Ethnicity in Canada, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In [[Law of Australia|Australian law]], the [[Anti-Discrimination Act 1977]] of [[New South Wales]] defines "race" to include "ethnic, ethno-religious or national origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aa1977204/s4.html|title=Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 Section 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reference to "ethno-religious" was added by the Anti-Discrimination (Amendment) Act 1994 (NSW).&lt;ref name="Cunneen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Faces of hate: hate crime in Australia |last=Cunneen |first=Chris |author2=David Fraser |author3=Stephen Tomsen |year=1997 |publisher=Hawkins Press |isbn=1-876067-05-5 |page=223 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8nmw1wlgeUC |accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hannaford]], the NSW Attorney-General at the time, explained, "The effect of the latter amendment is to clarify that ethno-religious groups, such as Jews, Muslims and Sikhs, have access to the racial vilification and discrimination provisions of the Act.... extensions of the Anti-Discrimination Act to ethno-religious groups will not extend to discrimination on the ground of religion".&lt;ref name="Anti-Discrimination (Amendment Act 1994 Second Reading"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LA19940512044 |title=Anti-Discrimination (Amendment) Bill: Second Reading |date=2007-05-12 |publisher=Parliament of New South Wales |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedition"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/publications.nsf/0/57ba30f38d3c969cca25710f0023442f/$FILE/Sedition%20FINAL.pdf |title=Sedition, Incitement and Vilification: Issues in the Current Debate |author=Gareth Griffith |date=February 2006 |publisher=NSW Parliamentary Library Research Service |isbn=0-7313-1792-0 |page=52 |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Discrimination (Amendment) Act 1994 made reference to ''Mandla v Dowell-Lee'', which defined ethnic groups as:

# a long shared history, of which the group is conscious as distinguishing it from other groups, and the memory of which it keeps alive;
#a cultural tradition of its own, including family and social customs and manners, often but not necessarily associated with religious observance. In addition to those two essential characteristics the following characteristics are, in my opinion, relevant:
#either a common geographical origin, or descent from a small number of common ancestors;
#a common language, not necessarily peculiar to the group;
#a common literature peculiar to the group;
#a common religion different from that of neighbouring groups or from the general community surrounding it;
#being a minority or being an oppressed or dominant group within a larger community. For example, a conquered people (say, the inhabitants of England shortly after the [[Norman conquest]]) and their conquerors might both be ethnic groups.

The significance of the case was that groups like Sikhs and Jews could now be protected under the [[Race Relations Act 1976]].&lt;ref name="equalrightstrust.org"/&gt;

'''Europlanet''' is a network linking planetary scientists from across [[Europe]].  The aim of Europlanet is to promote collaboration and communication between partner institutions and to support missions to explore the [[Solar System]].

EuroPlaNet co-ordinates activities in Planetary Sciences in order to achieve a long-term integration of this discipline in Europe.

==Objectives==
The objectives are to:
# increase the productivity of planetary projects with European investment, with emphasis on major planetary exploration missions;
# initiate a long-term integration of the European [[planetary science]] community;
# improve European scientific competitiveness, develop and spread expertise in this research area,
# improve public understanding of planetary environments.

These objectives will be achieved by:
# maximizing synergies between different fields contributing to planetary sciences: space observations, earth-based observations, laboratory studies, numerical simulations, data base development;
# co-ordinating the design and development of an Integrated and Distributed Information Service (IDIS) providing access to the full set of data sources produced by these complementary fields. EuroPlaNet integrates most of the European planetary exploration work, with initial focus on the [[Cassini–Huygens]] mission to [[Saturn]] and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], operative between 2004 and 2008. The considerable involvement of the European science community in this mission, the broad diversity of its research objectives and the urgent need to achieve a balanced share of data analysis and its results with American colleagues make Cassini–Huygens an ideal test-bed for the development of activities and tools which will contribute to the optimal exploitation of subsequent planetary missions.

In addition to overall co-ordination, 6 further activities will be carried out over a 4-year period:
# discipline working groups;
# co-ordinate [[earth]]-based observations to support and complement space missions;
# develop an [[outreach]] strategy;
# exchange of personnel;
# EuroPlaNet-specific meetings and conferences;
# definition of the basic requirements for future implementation of IDIS for [[planetary sciences]].

: &lt;math&gt; \exists X_1 \cdots \exists X_n \, F(X_1,\dots, X_n), \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F(X_1,\dots X_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[quantifier-free formula]] involving equalities and inequalities of [[real number|real]] [[polynomial]]s.&lt;ref name="bpr06"&gt;{{citation|contribution=Existential theory of the reals|first1=Saugata|last1=Basu|first2=Richard|last2=Pollack|author2-link=Richard M.

The [[decision problem]] for the existential theory of the reals is the problem of finding an [[algorithm]] that decides, for each such formula, whether it is true or false.  Equivalently, it is the problem of testing whether a given [[semialgebraic set]] is non-empty.&lt;ref name="bpr06"/&gt; This decision problem is [[NP-hard]] and lies in [[PSPACE]].&lt;ref name="canny"&gt;{{citation

Many natural problems in [[geometric graph theory]], especially problems of recognizing geometric [[intersection graph]]s and straightening the edges of [[graph drawing]]s with [[crossing number (graph theory)|crossings]], may be solved by translating them into instances of the existential theory of the reals, and are [[Complete (complexity)|complete]] for this theory. The [[complexity class]] &lt;math&gt;\exists\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, which lies between [[NP (complexity)|NP]] and PSPACE, has been defined to describe this class of problems.&lt;ref name="s09"/&gt;

==Background==
In [[mathematical logic]], a [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] is a [[formal language]] consisting of a set of [[Sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] written using a fixed set of symbols. The [[List of first-order theories#Rings and fields|first-order theory of real closed fields]] has the following symbols:&lt;ref name="mat14"/&gt;
*the constants 0 and 1,
*a countable collection of variables &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;,
*the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and (optionally) division operations,
*symbols &lt;, ≤, =, ≥, &gt;, and ≠ for comparisons of real values,
*the [[logical connective]]s ∧, ∨, ¬, and ⇔,
*parentheses, and
*the [[universal quantifier]] ∀ and the [[existential quantifier]] ∃
A sequence of these symbols forms a sentence that belongs to the first-order theory of the reals if it is grammatically well formed, all its variables are properly quantified, and (when interpreted as a mathematical statement about the [[real number]]s) it is a true statement. As Tarski showed, this theory can be described by an [[axiom schema]] and a decision procedure that is complete and effective: for every fully quantified and grammatical sentence, either the sentence or its negation (but not both) can be derived from the axioms. The same theory describes every [[real closed field]], not just the real numbers.&lt;ref name="tarski"/&gt; However, there are other number systems that are not accurately described by these axioms; in particular, the theory defined in the same way for [[integer]]s instead of real numbers is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]], even for existential sentences ([[Diophantine equation]]s) by [[Diophantine_set#Matiyasevich's theorem|Matiyasevich's theorem]].&lt;ref name="mat14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The existential theory of the reals is the subset of the first-order theory consisting of sentences in which all the quantifiers are existential and they appear before any of the other symbols. That is, it is the set of all true sentences of the form
: &lt;math&gt; \exists X_1 \cdots \exists X_n \, F(X_1,\dots, X_n), \, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F(X_1,\dots X_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[quantifier-free formula]] involving equalities and inequalities of [[real number|real]] [[polynomial]]s. The [[decision problem]] for the existential theory of the reals is the algorithmic problem of testing whether a given sentence belongs to this theory; equivalently, for strings that pass the basic syntactical checks (they use the correct symbols with the correct syntax, and have no unquantified variables) it is the problem of testing whether the sentence is a true statement about the real numbers. The set of ''n''-tuples of real numbers &lt;math&gt;(X_1,\dots X_n)&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;F(X_1,\dots X_n)&lt;/math&gt; is true is called a [[semialgebraic set]], so the decision problem for the existential theory of the reals can equivalently be rephrased as testing whether a given semialgebraic set is nonempty.&lt;ref name="bpr06"/&gt;

In determining the [[time complexity]] of [[algorithm]]s for the decision problem for the existential theory of the reals, it is important to have a measure of the size of the input. The simplest measure of this type is the length of a sentence: that is, the number of symbols it contains.&lt;ref name="mat14"/&gt; However, in order to achieve a more precise analysis of the behavior of algorithms for this problem, it is convenient to break down the input size into several variables, separating out the number of variables to be quantified, the number of polynomials within the sentence, and the degree of these polynomials.&lt;ref name="hong"/&gt;

==Examples==
The [[golden ratio]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; may be defined as the [[Root of a polynomial|root]] of the [[polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;x^2-x-1&lt;/math&gt;. This polynomial has two roots, only one of which (the golden ratio) is greater than one. Thus, the existence of the golden ratio may be expressed by the sentence
:&lt;math&gt;\exists X_1(  X_1 &gt; 1 \wedge X_1\times X_1 - X_1 - 1 = 0).&lt;/math&gt;
Because the golden ratio does exist, this is a true sentence, and belongs to the existential theory of the reals. The answer to the decision problem for the existential theory of the reals, given this sentence as input, is the Boolean value true.

The [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]] states that, for every two non-negative numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, the following inequality holds:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x+y}{2}\ge \sqrt{xy}.&lt;/math&gt;
As stated above, it is a first-order sentence about the real numbers, but one with universal rather than existential quantifiers, and one that uses extra symbols for division, square roots, and the number 2 that are not allowed in the first-order theory of the reals. However, by squaring both sides it can be transformed into the following existential statement that can be interpreted as asking whether the inequality has any counterexamples:
:&lt;math&gt;\exists X_1 \exists X_2 \bigl( X_1\ge 0\wedge X_2\ge 0\wedge (X_1+X_2)\times (X_1+X_2)&lt; (1+1+1+1)\times X_1\times X_2\bigr).&lt;/math&gt;
The answer to the decision problem for the existential theory of the reals, given this sentence as input, is the Boolean value false: there are no counterexamples. Therefore, this sentence does not belong to the existential theory of the reals, despite being of the correct grammatical form.

==Algorithms==
[[Alfred Tarski]]'s method of [[quantifier elimination]] (1948) showed the existential theory of the reals (and more generally the first order theory of the reals) to be algorithmically solvable, but without an [[Elementary function|elementary]] bound on its complexity.&lt;ref name="30essays"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tarski"&gt;{{citation

In the meantime, in 1988, [[John Canny]] described another algorithm that also has exponential time dependence, but only polynomial space complexity; that is, he showed that the problem could be solved in [[PSPACE]].&lt;ref name="canny"/&gt;&lt;ref name="30essays"/&gt;

The [[asymptotic computational complexity]] of these algorithms may be misleading, because they can only be run on inputs of very small size. In a 1991 comparison, Hoon Hong estimated that Collins' doubly exponential procedure would be able to solve a problem whose size is described by setting all the above parameters to 2, in less than a second, whereas the algorithms of Grigoriev, Vorbjov, and Renegar would instead take more than a million years.&lt;ref name="hong"/&gt; In 1993, Joos, Roy, and Solernó suggested that it should be possible to make small modifications to the exponential-time procedures to make them faster in practice than cylindrical algebraic decision, as well as faster in theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Complete problems==
Several problems in computational complexity and [[geometric graph theory]] may be classified as [[Complete (complexity)|complete]] for the existential theory of the reals. That is, every problem in the existential theory of the reals has a [[polynomial-time reduction|polynomial-time many-one reduction]] to an instance of one of these problems, and in turn these problems are reducible to the existential theory of the reals.&lt;ref name="s09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cg62"/&gt;

A number of problems of this type concern the recognition of [[intersection graph]]s of a certain type. In these problems, the input is an [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|undirected graph]]; the goal is to determine whether geometric shapes from a certain class of shapes can be associated with the vertices of the graph in such a way that two vertices are adjacent in the graph if and only if their associated shapes have a non-empty intersection. Problems of this type that are complete for the existential theory of the reals include
recognition of [[intersection graph]]s of [[line segment]]s in the plane,&lt;ref name="s09"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

For graphs drawn in the plane without crossings, [[Fáry's theorem]] states that one gets the same class of [[planar graph]]s regardless of whether the edges of the graph are drawn as straight line segments or as arbitrary curves. But this equivalence does not hold true for other types of drawing. For instance, although the [[Crossing number (graph theory)|crossing number]] of a graph (the minimum number of crossings in a drawing with arbitrarily curved edges) may be determined in NP, it is complete for the existential theory of the reals to determine whether there exists a drawing achieving a given bound on the rectilinear crossing number (the minimum number of pairs of edges that cross in any drawing with edges drawn as straight line segments in the plane).&lt;ref name="s09"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The '''eyespot apparatus''' (or ''[[stigma (anatomy)|stigma]]'') is a photoreceptive [[organelle]] found in the flagellate or (motile) cells of [[green algae]] and other [[microorganism|unicellular]] [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms such as [[euglenid]]s. It allows the cells to sense [[light]] direction and intensity and respond to it by swimming either towards the light (positive [[phototaxis]]) or away from the light (negative phototaxis).  A related response ("photoshock" or photophobic response) occurs when cells are briefly exposed to high light intensity, causing the cell to stop, briefly swim backwards, then change swimming direction. Eyespot-mediated light perception helps the cells in finding an environment with optimal light conditions for photosynthesis. Eyespots are the simplest and most common "eyes" found in nature, composed of [[photoreceptor protein|photoreceptors]] and areas of bright orange-red pigment granules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kreimer | first1 = G.| title = The green algal eyespot apparatus: A primordial visual system and more? | doi = 10.1007/s00294-008-0224-8 | journal = [[Current Genetics]]| volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–43 | year = 2009| pmid =  19107486| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Signals relayed from the eyespot photoreceptors result in alteration of the beating pattern of the flagella, generating a phototactic response.&lt;ref name="Hegemann"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hegemann P |title=Vision in microalgae |journal=Planta |volume=203 |issue=3 |pages=265–74 |year=1997 |pmid=9431675 |doi=10.1007/s004250050191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microscopic structure==
Under the [[light microscope]], eyespots appear as dark, orange-reddish spots or ''stigmata''. They get their color from [[carotenoid]] pigments contained in bodies called pigment granules.  The photoreceptors are found in the [[plasma membrane]] overlaying the pigmented bodies.

The eyespot apparatus of ''[[Euglena]]'' comprises the paraflagellar body connecting the eyespot to the [[flagellum]]. In [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]], the eyespot apparatus appears as a highly ordered lamellar structure formed by membranous rods in a helical arrangement.&lt;ref name="Wolken"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolken J |title=Euglena: the photoreceptor system for phototaxis |journal=J Protozool |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=518–22 |year=1977 |pmid=413913 |doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.1977.tb01004.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'', the eyespot is part of the [[chloroplast]] and takes on the appearance of a membranous sandwich structure. It is assembled from [[chloroplast membrane]]s (outer, inner, and thylakoid membranes) and [[carotenoid]]-filled granules overlaid by [[plasma membrane]]. The stacks of granules act as a [[quarter-wave plate]], reflecting incoming photons back to the overlying photoreceptors, while shielding the photoreceptors from light coming from other directions.  It disassembles during [[cell division]] and reforms in the daughter cells in an asymmetric fashion in relation to the [[cytoskeleton]].  This asymmetric positioning of the eyespot in the cell is essential for proper phototaxis.&lt;ref name="Dieckmann"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dieckmann C |title=Eyespot placement and assembly in the green alga Chlamydomonas |journal=BioEssays |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=410–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12655648 |doi=10.1002/bies.10259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eyespot proteins==
The most critical eyespot proteins are the [[photoreceptor protein]]s that sense light. The photoreceptors found in unicellular organisms fall into two main groups: [[flavoprotein]]s and [[retinylidene protein]]s (rhodopsins). Flavoproteins are characterized by containing [[Flavin group|flavin]] molecules as [[chromophore]]s, whereas retinylidene proteins contain [[retinal]]. The photoreceptor protein in ''Euglena'' is likely a flavoprotein.&lt;ref name="Wolken"/&gt; In contrast, ''Chlamydomonas'' phototaxis is mediated by archaeal-type rhodopsins.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Suzuki T, Yamasaki K, Fujita S, Oda K, Iseki M, Yoshida K, Watanabe M, Daiyasu H, Toh H, Asamizu E, Tabata S, Miura K, Fukuzawa H, Nakamura S, Takahashi T |title=Archaeal-type rhodopsins in Chlamydomonas: model structure and intracellular localization |journal=Biochem Biophys Res Commun |volume=301 |issue=3 |pages=711–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12565839 |doi=10.1016/S0006-291X(02)03079-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides photoreceptor proteins, eyespots contain a large number of structural, metabolic and signaling proteins. The eyespot [[proteome]] of ''Chlamydomonas'' cells consists of roughly 200 different proteins.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmidt M, Gessner G, Luff M, Heiland I, Wagner V, Kaminski M, Geimer S, Eitzinger N, Reissenweber T, Voytsekh O, Fiedler M, Mittag M, Kreimer G |title=Proteomic analysis of the eyespot of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii provides novel insights into its components and tactic movements |journal=Plant Cell |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=1908–30 |year=2006 |pmid=16798888 |doi=10.1105/tpc.106.041749 |pmc=1533972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photoreception and signal transduction==
The ''Euglena'' photoreceptor was identified as a blue-light-activated [[adenylyl cyclase]].&lt;ref name="Iseki"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Iseki M, Matsunaga S, Murakami A, Ohno K, Shiga K, Yoshida K, Sugai M, Takahashi T, Hori T, Watanabe M |title=A blue-light-activated adenylyl cyclase mediates photoavoidance in Euglena gracilis |journal=Nature |volume=415 |issue=6875 |pages=1047–51 |year=2002 |pmid=11875575 |doi=10.1038/4151047a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excitation of this receptor protein results in the formation of [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP) as a [[second messenger system|second messenger]]. Chemical [[signal transduction]] ultimately triggers changes in flagellar beat patterns and cell movement.

The archaeal-type rhodopsins of ''Chlamydomonas'' contain an all-''trans'' retinylidene chromatophore which undergoes [[photoisomerization]] to a 13-''cis'' isomer. This activates a photoreceptor channel, leading to a change in [[membrane potential]] and cellular calcium ion concentration.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"/&gt; Photoelectric signal transduction ultimately triggers changes in flagellar strokes and thus cell movement.&lt;ref name="Hegemann"/&gt;

The '''Carl F. Eyring Science Center''' (ESC) is one of the science buildings on the [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) campus in [[Provo, Utah]].  It was built in 1950 and named after [[Carl F. Eyring]] in 1954.

The ESC houses the departments of Physics and Astronomy, Geology, and Food Science and Nutrition.  The Department of Chemistry has in the past been located at the ESC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=51304 | year=1991 | author1=Xie | first1=W.

In 1968 an underground physics research lab was added to the north end of the building.  Research on plasma, atomic processes, lasers, high-pressure physics, nanotechnology, [[acoustics]], and cold fusion have been conducted here. It is the home of two modern TEMs.

The [[Royden G. Derrick]] Planetarium is also in the building.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lds.org.uk/church_world_news.php?id=141&lt;/ref&gt; This 119-seat facility with a {{convert|39|ft|m|adj=on}} acoustically-treated dome was built in 2005 to replace the smaller, outdated Sarah Barrett Summerhays Planetarium.  In the summer of 2006 a new dome was installed on the ESC's observatory to better allow for astronomical study on campus. The building also has several acoustics labs including two [[anechoic chamber]]s and two [[reverberation chamber|reverberation chambers]] for performing acoustics research.

The 5th and 6th floors of the ESC constitute the [[Orson Pratt]] Observatory.&lt;ref&gt;http://astronomy.byu.edu/opo.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the ESC, [[James A. Jensen]]'s dinosaur displays were often in the lobby.  However, since the building of the [[BYU Earth Science Museum]], dinosaur displays are less common.

The main lobby of the building is noted for its [[Foucault pendulum]].  It also houses a student-run restaurant, the Pendulum Court, during the fall and winter semesters.

The ESC was the first building at BYU to have an elevator.

The cartridge was often used at radio stations until the late 1990s, when such formats as [[MiniDisc]] and computerized [[broadcast automation]] predominated.

== History ==
The Fidelipac cartridge was the first audio tape cartridge available commercially, based on the [[Endless tape cartridge|endless-loop tape cartridge]] design developed by [[Bernard Cousino]] in 1952, while Eash shared space in Cousino's electronics shop in the early 1950s.  Instead of manufacturing the Fidelipac format himself after developing it, Eash decided to license it for manufacture to Telepro Industries, in [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey]].  Telepro then manufactured and marketed the format under the Fidelipac brand name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0ZmjkJwxyWcC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=telepro+industries+cherry+hill,+nj&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b_nWaqr9qp&amp;sig=OhFvQVjnWml3xoORa-M_zIcZIU0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPmse4qerJAhWENSYKHcC7AaoQ6AEIJjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=telepro%20industries%20cherry%20hill%2C%20nj&amp;f=false Sound Recording: The Life Story of a Technology by David Morton @ Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tape format ==
Fidelipac was originally a {{convert|1/4|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} [[analog recording]] tape, two-track format. One of the tracks was used for monaural program audio, and the other being used for a cue track to control the player, where either a ''primary'' cue tone was recorded to automatically stop the cart, a ''secondary'' tone was recorded to automatically re-cue the cart to the beginning of the cart's program material (in some models, two secondary tones, one after the program material, and one before it, were recorded to have the cart machine automatically fast-forward through any leftover blank tape at the end of a cart's program), or a ''tertiary'' tone, which was used by some players to trigger another cart player or another form of external equipment. Later versions used three tracks, two for stereo audio, and the third for the cue track.

The standard tape speed for Fidelipac carts used in the radio broadcasting industry is 7.5 [[inches per second|ips]], although some cart players and recorders can be set to record at other speeds, such as 3.75 or 15 ips.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cqYBIuYBUvsC&amp;pg=PT490&amp;lpg=PT490&amp;dq=NAB+cartridge&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bvBYbu2XB-&amp;sig=n3a5IDc3yZ8O7VCh9QEe0Dz3l0k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result Audio Engineer's Reference Book By Michael Talbot-Smith @ Googlebooks]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cartridge format ==
Unlike the later consumer-marketed [[8-track tape|8-track cartridge]] developed later in 1964 by [[Bill Lear]] which had the [[pinch roller]] integrated in the cartridge, the Fidelipac cartridge had a hole in the right-hand bottom front corner of the cartridge, where the pinch roller, built into the player instead, would swing up into place to support the tape up against the [[Capstan (tape recorder)|capstan]]. While later machines from ATC, ITC, Harris, and others had machines where the pinch roller would automatically engage into the cartridge when the play button was pressed (the capstan motor was already running when the cart was inserted), early machines such as Sparta, Spot-matic, and others made the operator physically push or pull a lever to get the pinch roller in place before playback could begin. However, the 8-track was slower in speed ({{frac|3|3|4}} [[inches per second|ips]] compared to Fidelipac's {{frac|7|1|2}} ips) and did not have adequate tape support pads, and thus were not "broadcast quality." The lower speed and narrower tracks in 8-track cartridges led to higher noise and poorer frequency response. The 8-track design also lacked a cue track.

There were three sizes of Fidelipac carts available&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the 4-inch-wide A size (Fidelipac Model 300, 350 and MasterCart), which was a standard 8-track size cart with maximum {{frac|10|1|2}} minute playing time at 7.5 ips (this was the most common and widely used size of Fidelipac cart); the 6-inch-wide B size (Fidelipac Model 600), a larger cartridge designed for holding longer programs; and the even larger 8-inch-wide C size (Fidelipac Model 1200), often used for [[background music]] applications like the [[Rowe Customusic]].

The A size Fidelipac cartridge was later adapted by [[Earl "Madman" Muntz]] in partnership with George Eash in 1963 for his [[Stereo-Pak]] cartridge system (also known as a  [[4-track cartridge]]), which differed in two ways&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the number of tracks used (four in this case, with two played back at a time to provide a total of two programs of stereo audio), and the tape speed ({{frac|3|3|4}} ips—the same speed as 8-track cartridges, as opposed to Fidelipac's standard {{frac|7|1|2}} ips).  Unlike the Fidelipac players which used a stationary head, the Stereo-Pak system used a moving head to go between the two programs (much like the 8-track format, which also used a moving head to access its four stereo programs).

Saint John described the scene,
:before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal... round about... were four beasts full of eyes... The four and twenty elders fall down before him... and worship him that liveth for ever and ever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=1149&amp;tabview=work The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne: Description].

[[File:The Four and Twenty Elders (William Blake).jpg|thumb|''The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne'', c. 1803–5. [[William Blake]], [[Tate]]. 354 x 293 mm.]]

In the centre of a huge hall is placed a throne: round about the Throne are four and twenty seats on which sit four and twenty Elders, robed in white and wearing crowns of gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ienvr_jFYAEC|p=2902|title=Complete Evangelical Parallel Bible-PR-KJV/NKJV/NIV/NLT|isbn=9781598569506|author1=Bibles|first1=Hendrickson|date=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Assembly is introduced the Lamb that is to be initiated. In front of the Throne are four remarkable beasts ([[Living creatures (Bible)|living creatures]]): one of them is like a lion, another resembles an eagle, the third has the appearance of a calf, and the fourth has the face of a man. These beasts have six wings each, and are full of eyes all over; and they rest not night and day, but keep on blessing the One on the Throne.

== Interpretation ==
The word "Elder" in the majority of places where it is used in the Scriptures means the representative head of a city, family, tribe or nation, so the "Four and Twenty Elders" are representative of the redeemed human race. But why 24 Elders? Twenty-four is the number of the Priestly Courses as given in 1. Chron. 24:1-19. When David distributed the Priests into "Courses" he found there were 24 Heads of the Priestly families, and these 24 Heads he made representative of the WHOLE PRIESTHOOD. As the "Elders" are representative of both the Old and New Testament Saints, and the Old Testament Saints are represented by the Twelve Tribes of Israel, and the New Testament Saints' by the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, they together make up 24 representative characters. This distinction is clearly brought out in the description of the New Jerusalem, where the 12 Foundation Stones are named after the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, and the 12 Gates after the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Rev. 21:10-14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/tbr/tbr022.htm|title=The Book of Revelation: III. The Things Which Shall Be Hereafter: 3. The Four and Twenty Elders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Allegorical interpretation ==
[[Champat Rai Jain]], a 20th-century Jain writer claimed that the "Four and Twenty Elders" mentioned in the [[Christian Bible]] are "Twenty-four Jain ''[[Tirthankara]]s''".{{sfn|Jain|1930|p=78}} In his book, Jainism Christianity and Science, he wrote:{{quote|Briefly, the beasts represent the different kinds of souls that are embodied in the four elements (of matter), namely, the earth-bodied (represented by the lion, since he walks on earth), the air-bodied (represented by the eagle who flies in the air), the water-bodied (represented by the calf, which here is the young of the sea-mammals), and the fire-bodied (represented by the sun which is painted as the face of a man). Wings are a symbol for time, since it flies; and the number six is descriptive of the six ''aras'' (spokes) or a half-cycle in which four and twenty ''Tirthamkaras'' appear and preach the Truth. Plainly put, the significance of the secret teaching is only this that Life is Divine, and its divinity is manifested most perfectly and fully in the case of four and twenty ''Tirihamkaras'', who appear in a half-cycle of time, consisting of six aras, and preach the Noble Truth to and for the benefit of the souls embodied in material bodies.{{sfn|Jain|1930|p=78-79}}}}

'''Genetically engineered blood''' is blood that has been modified for therapeutic or other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Startup Says Engineered Blood Cells Can Deliver Drugs to the Body {{!}} MIT Technology Review|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/544281/turning-red-blood-cells-into-versatile-drug-carriers/|website = MIT Technology Review|last=Orcutt |first=Mike  |date=December 9, 2015|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

Genetically modifying red blood [[stem cells]] allows them to produce specific therapeutic proteins on the surface or inside the cell. The stem cells are taken from [[mammal]]ian [[bone marrow]] and are modified in culture. Before they become mature, mammalian red blood cells eject their genetic material. Culturing cells that produce a new protein of interest requires only a few weeks. Using the [[sortagging]] [[protein labeling]] technique, the researchers used the [[bacterial enzyme]] [[sortase A]] to establish a strong chemical bond between the surface protein and a substance of choice, such as a small-molecule therapeutic agent or an [[antibody]]. The modifications leave the cells and their surfaces otherwise intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Engineered red blood cells as carriers for systemic delivery of a wide array of functional probes|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/111/28/10131|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2014-07-15|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 4104923|pmid = 24982154|pages = 10131–10136|volume = 111|issue = 28|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1409861111|language = en|first = Jiahai|last = Shi|first2 = Lenka|last2 = Kundrat|first3 = Novalia|last3 = Pishesha|first4 = Angelina|last4 = Bilate|first5 = Chris|last5 = Theile|first6 = Takeshi|last6 = Maruyama|first7 = Stephanie K.|last7 = Dougan|first8 = Hidde L.|last8 = Ploegh|first9 = Harvey F.|last9 = Lodish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

One application is to engineer [[red blood cells]] into drug-delivery vehicles. Mature red cells carry no genetic material, potentially presenting fewer safety risks than other [[gene therapy|gene]] and [[cell therapies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home|url = http://www.rubiustx.com/|website = Rubius Therapeutics|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human red blood cells circulate for as long as four months, meaning they could potentially form the basis of long-term therapies. The cells move throughout body via the [[bloodstream]] and are unnoticed by the [[immune system]].

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[arbuscular mycorrhiza]]l species are terrestrial and widely distributed in soils worldwide where they form symbioses with the roots of the majority of plant species (&gt;80%). They can also be found in [[wetland]]s, including salt-marshes, and associated with epiphytic plants.

== Reproduction ==

The Glomeromycota have generally [[coenocyte|coenocytic]] (occasionally sparsely [[Hypha#Types|septate]]) [[mycelia]] and reproduce asexually through blastic development of the hyphal tip to produce [[spore]]s&lt;ref name=schuessler/&gt; (Glomerospores) with diameters of 80–500&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]].&lt;ref name=simon/&gt; In some, complex spores form within a terminal saccule.&lt;ref name=schuessler/&gt;  Recently it was shown that ''Glomus'' species contain 51 genes encoding all the tools necessary for meiosis.&lt;ref name="pmid21876220"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Halary S, Malik SB, Lildhar L, Slamovits CH, Hijri M, Corradi N |title=Conserved meiotic machinery in ''Glomus'' spp., a putatively ancient asexual fungal lineage |journal=Genome Biol Evol |volume=3 |issue= |pages=950–8 |year=2011 |pmid=21876220 |pmc=3184777 |doi=10.1093/gbe/evr089 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on these and related findings, it was suggested that ''Glomus'' species may have a cryptic sexual cycle.&lt;ref name="pmid21876220" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24260466"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Halary S, Daubois L, Terrat Y, Ellenberger S, Wöstemeyer J, Hijri M |title=Mating type gene homologues and putative sex pheromone-sensing pathway in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, a presumably asexual plant root symbiont |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=e80729 |year=2013 |pmid=24260466 |pmc=3834313 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0080729 |url=|bibcode=2013PLoSO...880729H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22075432"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sanders IR |title=Fungal sex: meiosis machinery in ancient symbiotic fungi |journal=Curr.

== Colonization ==

New colonization of AM fungi largely depends on the amount of [[inoculum]] present in the soil.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Zangaro, Waldemar, Leila Rostirola, Vergal Souza, Priscila Almeida Alves, Bochi Lescano, Ricardo Rondina, Luiz Nogueira, and Eduardo Carrenho. "Root Colonization and Spore Abundance of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi in Distinct Successional Stages from an Atlantic Rainforest Biome in Southern Brazil." Mycorrhiza 23.3 (2013): 221-33. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although pre-existing hyphae and infected root fragments have been shown to successfully colonize the roots of a host, germinating spores are considered to be the key players in new host establishment. [[Spore]]s are commonly dispersed by fungal and plant burrowing herbivore partners, but some air dispersal capabilities are also known.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith |first1=Sally E. |last2=Read|first2=David J.|date=2008 |title= Mycorrhizal symbiosis |publisher=Academic Press |edition=3 |isbn= 9780123705266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have shown that spore germination is specific to particular environmental conditions such as right amount of nutrients, temperature or host availability.  It has also been observed that the rate of root system colonization is directly correlated to spore density in the soil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, new data also suggests that AM fungi host plants also secrete chemical factors which attract and enhance the growth of developing spore hyphae towards the root system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The necessary components for the colonization of Glomeromycota include, the host's fine root system, proper development of intracellular arbuscular structures, and a well-established external fungal [[mycelium]].  Colonization is accomplished by the interactions between germinating spore hyphae and the root hairs of the host or by development of [[appressorium|appressoria]] between epidermal root cells.  The process is regulated by specialized chemical signaling and by changes in gene expression of both the host and AM fungi.  Intracellular hyphae extend up to the [[Cortex (botany)|cortical cells]] of the root and penetrate the cell walls, but not the inner cellular membrane creating an internal [[invagination]] .  The penetrating hyphae develop a highly branched structure called an [[arbuscular mycorrhizae|arbuscule]] which have low functional periods before degradation and absorption by host's root cells.   A fully developed arbuscular mycorrhizal structure facilitates the two-way movement of nutrients between the host and [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] fungal partner.  The [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] association allows the host plant to respond better to environment stresses, and the non-photosynthetic fungi to obtain carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Phylogeny ==

Initial studies of the Glomeromycota were based on the morphology of soil-borne sporocarps (spore clusters) found in or near colonized plant roots.&lt;ref&gt;

Fossil Glomeromycota are known back 2200 million years as [[Diskagma]], and also by Mesoproterozoic [[Horodyskia]] and Ordovician to Devonian [[Prototaxites]].

== Molecular biology ==
The biochemical and genetic characterization of the Glomeromycota has been hindered by their [[biotrophic]] nature, which impedes laboratory culturing. This obstacle was eventually surpassed with the use of root cultures. The first mycorrhizal gene to be sequenced was the small-subunit [[ribosomal RNA]] (SSU rRNA).&lt;ref&gt;

'''Groundcover''' or '''ground cover''' is any [[plant]] that grows over an area of ground. Groundcover provides [[soil protection|protection]] of the [[topsoil]] from [[erosion]] and [[drought]].

In an [[ecosystem]], the ground cover forms the layer of vegetation below the [[shrub layer]] known as the [[herbaceous layer]]. The most widespread ground covers are [[Poaceae|grasses]] of various types.

In [[ecology]], groundcover is a difficult subject to address because it is known by several different names and is classified in several different ways. The term groundcover could also be referring to “the herbaceous layer,” “regenerative layer", “ground flora” or even "step over."

In [[agriculture]], ground cover refers to anything that lies on top of the soil and protects it from erosion and inhibits weeds.  It can be anything from a low layer of [[grass]]es to a plastic material. The term ''ground cover'' can also specifically refer to [[landscaping fabric]] which is like a breathable tarp that allows water and gas exchange.

In [[gardening]] jargon, however, the term ''groundcover'' refers to plants that are used in place of [[weed]]s and improves appearance by concealing bare earth.

== Contributions to the environment ==
The herbaceous layer is often overlooked in most ecological analyses because it is so common and contributes the smallest amount of the environment’s overall [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. However, groundcover is crucial to the survival of many environments. The groundcover layer of a forest can contribute up to 90% of the ecosystem’s plant diversity. Additionally, the herbaceous layer ratio of biomass to contribution to plant productivity is disproportionate in many ecosystems. The herbaceous layer can constitute up to 4% of the overall [[Primary production|net primary productivity]] (NPP) of an ecosystem, four times its average biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://science.marshall.edu/gilliam/Chapter%2014.pdf|title=The Herbaceous Layer in Forests of North America|last=Gilliam|first=Frank|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|location=USA|chapter=The Dynamic Nature of the Herbaceous Layer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
Groundcover typically reproduces one of five ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.ext.vt.edu/426/426-609/426-609_pdf.pdf|title=Selecting Landscape Plants: Groundcovers|last=Niemiera|first=Alex|date=2012|website=Virginia State University|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lateral growth 
* Side growth: Branches on the side of the plant extend outwards upon contact with the soil.
* Base growth: New plants produced from the base of the origin plant.
* Under/Above Ground growth: Produced from [[rhizome]]s and [[stolon]]s
* Roots
Like most foliage, groundcover reacts to both natural and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] disturbances. These responses can be classified as legacy or active responses. Legacy responses occur during long-term changes to an environment, such as the conversion of a forest to agricultural land and back into forest. Active responses occur with sudden disturbances to the environment, such as tornadoes and forest fires.

Groundcover has also been known to influence the placement and growth of tree seedlings. All tree seedlings must first fall from their origin trees and then permeate the layer created by groundcover in order to reach the soil and germinate. The groundcover filters out a large amount seeds, but lets a smaller portion of seeds pass through and grow. This filtration provides ample amount of space between the seeds for future growth. In some areas, the groundcover can become so dense that no seeds can permeate the surface, and the forest is instead converted to shrubbery. Groundcover also inhibits the amount of light which reaches the floor of an ecosystem. An experiment conducted with the ''[[rhododendron maximum]]'' canopy in the southern [[Appalachian region]] concluded that 4 to 8% of total sunlight makes it to the herbaceous layer, whereas only about 1 to 2% reaches the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Herbaceous Layer in Forests of Eastern North America|last=Gilliam|first=Frank|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|location=USA|chapter=The Herbaceous Layer as a Filter Determining Spatial Pattern in Forest Tree Regeneration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variation===
Two common variations of groundcover are residency and transient species. Residency species typically reach a maximum of 1.5 meters in height, and are therefore permanently classified as herbaceous. Transient species are capable of growing past 1.5 meters, and are therefore only temporarily considered herbaceous. These height differences make ideal environments for a variety of animals, such as the [[reed warbler]], the [[Micromys minutus|harvest mouse]] and the [[wren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discoverwildlife.com/british-wildlife/how-identify-bird-and-mammal-nests|title=How to identify bird and mammal nests|last=Harris|first=Steve|date=2010-06-09|website=Discover Wildlife|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groundcover can also be classified in terms of its foliage. Groundcover that keeps its foliage for the entire year is known as [[evergreen]], whereas groundcover that loses its foliage in the winter months is known as [[deciduous]].

== In gardening ==
[[File:Microstegium vimineum.JPG|thumbnail|''[[Microstegium vimineum]]'', an invasive groundcover]]
Five general types of plants are commonly used as groundcovers in [[gardening]]:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pinterest.com/explore/ground-covering-plants/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegardenhelper.com/shadecovers.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.finegardening.com/covering-ground-creeping-plants&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vine]]s, which are [[woody plant]]s with slender, spreading stems
* [[Herbaceous]] plants, or non-woody plants
* [[Shrub]]s of low-growing, spreading species
* [[Moss]] of larger, coarser species
* [[Ornamental grass]]es, especially low-growing varieties

Of these types, some of the most common groundcovers include:

* [[Alfalfa]] (''Medicago sativa'')
* [[Clover]] (''Trifolium'')
* [[Dichondra]]
* [[Bacopa]] (''Bacopa'')
* [[Hedera|Ivy]] (''Hedera'')
* [[Gazania]] (''Gazania rigens'')
* [[Ground-elder]] (''Aegopodium podagraria'')
* [[Aizoaceae|Ice plant]]
* [[Japanese honeysuckle]] (''Lonicera japonica'')
* [[Juniper]]s of various low-growing types
* [[Lantana]], creeping species
* [[Liriope (plant)|Lilyturf]] (''[[Liriope muscari]]'' and ''[[Liriope spicata]]'')
* [[Mentha|Mint]] (''Mentha'')
* [[Tropaeolum majus|Nasturtium]] (''Tropaeolum majus'')
* [[Pachysandra]]
* [[Sagina|Pearlwort]] (''Sagina subulata'')
* [[Vinca|Periwinkle]] (''Vinca'')
* [[Leucanthemum × superbum|Shasta daisy]] (''Leucanthemum'')
* [[Soleirolia soleirolii|Soleirolia]] (''Soleirolia soleirolii'')
* [[Chlorophytum comosum|Spider plant]] (''Chlorophytum comosum'')

=== In roof gardens ===
Groundcover is a popular solution for difficult gardening issues because it is low maintenance, aesthetically pleasing and fast growing, minimizing the spread of weeds. For this reason, ground cover is also a common choice for roof gardens. Roofs take on the brunt of incoming weather, meaning any plants on a roof must be resistant to long-term exposure to sun, overwatering from rain and harsh winds. Groundcover plants are able to sustain themselves in such conditions while also providing lush vegetation to what would otherwise be unused space.

The '''HMS ''Investigator'' Anchors''' are the two [[anchor]]s that [[Matthew Flinders]] jettisoned from {{HMS|Investigator|1801|6}} on the morning of Saturday 21 May 1803 in order to avoid running aground on [[Middle Island (Western Australia)|Middle Island]] in the [[Archipelago of the Recherche]] on the south coast of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] (now [[Western Australia]]). In 1973, the anchors were located and recovered by members of the Underwater Explorers Club of South Australia (UEC). The recovered anchors became the subject of an ownership dispute between various governments, particularly those of [[Government of South Australia|South Australia]] and [[Government of Western Australia|Western Australia]] due to their historic significance as artefacts of a major voyage of European exploration. The dispute was resolved with the ownership of the anchors going to the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] who subsequently gifted one of the anchors to the South Australian Government. The pair of artefacts is also known as ''Flinders' Anchors''.

==Background==
The outfitting of HMS ''Investigator'' in early 1801 prior to her departure from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] for [[Terra Australis]] included five [[Anchor#Anchoring gear|bower]], two [[Anchor#Kedging|stream]] and two [[Anchor#Anchoring gear#kredging|kedge]] anchors. An additional bower anchor was included in stores sent to Port Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;Geeson, N.T. and Sexton, R.T.; (1970), 'H.M. Sloop Investigator', pages 293-294, in ''Mariner's Mirror'', v.56, no. 3, Society for Nautical Research, London, pages 275-298.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flinders01.jpg|thumb|left|Flinders around about this time.]]
HMS ''Investigator'' departed [[Kupang]] in [[West Timor|Timor]] on 8 April 1803 to sail to [[Port Jackson]] where she arrived on 9 June 1803. The object of the voyage was to seek medical aid for the members of the crew who were suffering from [[dysentery]] and fever, and seek repairs to the sloop. Flinders' intention was "to stop a day or two" at the Archipelago of the Recherche for "the purposes of procuring geese for our sick people, seal oil for our lamps, and a few casks of salt from the lake on Middle Island." HMS ''Investigator'' arrived on the evening of Tuesday 17 May 1803 and anchored on the north side of Middle Island between the island's north east point and Goose Island in the area known as Goose Island Bay.&lt;ref name=Flinders1803&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flinders|first1=Matthew|title=A voyage to Terra Australis undertaken for the purpose of completing the discovery of that vast country, and prosecuted in the years 1801, 1802 and 1803, in his majesty's ship the Investigator, and subsequently in the armed vessel Porpoise and Cumberland schooner.

The visit to Middle Island also allowed the burial of the sloop's boatswain, Charles Douglas, who died on Wednesday 18 May 1803 to take place on dry land.&lt;ref name=Log&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flinders|first1=Matthew|title=Log of the Investigator, ADM55, Log 76, 14 Mar 1803 to 10 Jan 1804|url=http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/browse/badc/corral/images/adm55/log076/adm55_log076_page032.jpg|publisher=British Atmospheric Data Centre|page=32|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Jeremy|last2=Souter|first2=Corioli|last3=Baker|first3=Patrick|title=Department of Maritime Archaeology Visit to Middle Island, Recherche Archipelago, Esperance, 29 April–4 May 2001, Report–Department of Maritime Archaeology Western Australian Maritime Museum No. 154|url=http://museum.wa.gov.au/maritime-archaeology-db/sites/default/files/no._154_middlei.pdf|publisher=Western Australian Maritime Museum|accessdate=27 February 2015|pages=2-3|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss==
Flinders discovered, on departure during the morning of Saturday 21 May 1803, that HMS ''Investigator'' was in danger of being driven aground on Middle Island by a freshening breeze before the sails could be loosed. This danger was mitigated by using the sloop's spare anchors to hold it in place. However, Flinders needed to abandon the best bower anchor, a stream anchor, and a quantity of cable in order to safely depart from the bay. Instead of recovering the two anchors, HMS ''Investigator'' continued towards Port Jackson with the intention of retrieving these at a later time.&lt;ref name=Log/&gt;

==The discovery and recovery==
Doug Seton, an information officer at the [[South Australian Museum]] found out about the loss of the anchors in 1969 during a conversation with Robert Sexton, a friend and a well-known South Australian maritime historian. Seton then commenced a four-year desktop study to identify the likely area in which the anchors could be found.&lt;ref name=Hooked&gt;{{cite news|title=Team of divers hooked on anchor|publisher=The Sunday Mail|date=24 December 1972|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Seton, a [[scuba diving]] enthusiast, planned an expedition to find and recover the anchors with the assistance of the following fellow members of the UEC - Terry &amp; Helen Drew, Peter &amp; Rosalie Koch and John Summers, the following residents of [[Esperance, Western Australia|Esperance]] - Don Gulvan, Don McKenzie and Tony Moore of Cape Arid Farm, and with the support of the following sponsors - [[BP]], a boating business known as ''Lawton Agencies'' and the [[Adelaide]] newspaper, the [[Sunday Mail (Adelaide)|''Sunday Mail'']].&lt;ref name=Hooked/&gt;&lt;ref name=Seton&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seton|first1=Doug|title=The search and recovery of the Investigator anchor'', a 4 page brochure whose publisher is not identified and which was viewed at the  State Library of South Australia, Call No. 909.096576 S439b|url=http://encore.slsa.sa.gov.au/iii/encore/record/C__Rb1081825__SSeton%2C+Doug__P0%2C1__Orightresult__X3?lang=eng&amp;suite=cobalt|accessdate=1 March 2015|date=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition departed Adelaide on 26 December 1972 for Esperance. Later that day, the expedition was postponed due to a vehicle accident north of [[Port Wakefield]] which resulted in Terry and Helen Drew being hospitalised, their vehicle being destroyed, their boat being damaged and the two occupants of the other vehicle being killed.&lt;ref&gt;'Three more killed: Holiday road toll now eight', ''The Advertiser'', 27 December 1972, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Terry &amp; Helen Drew would later re-join the expedition to witness the recovery of both anchors.&lt;ref name=SAgetsanchor&gt;{{cite news|title=SA gets anchor|publisher=The Advertiser|date=2 March 1974|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition resumed and arrived at Middle Island on 4 January 1973. After a week of rough weather, the search commenced on 11 January using a manta board constructed from driftwood and other materials. The best bower anchor was discovered by Peter Koch in 15m deep water on 14 January. After reviewing his desktop research, Seton re-organised the search and found the stream anchor about 9 metres away from the best bower anchor, several hours later.&lt;ref name=Seton/&gt; The news of the discovery was announced on 15 January.&lt;ref&gt;'SA divers trace old anchors', ''The Advertiser'', 16 January 1973, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As pre-arranged with the then Commonwealth Department of Shipping and Transport, the lighthouse supply tender, [[MV Cape Don|MV ''Cape Don'']], arrived on 19 January to lift both anchors off the seabed and conveyed them to Fremantle for conservation.&lt;ref&gt;'Anchors aweigh!, Must come to SA', ''The Sunday Mail'', 21 January 1973, page 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The return of Flinders anchors', ''BP Shield International'', October 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;’Flinders anchors’, Fremantle Cockburn News, 6 February 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispute over ownership==
As soon as the news of the discovery of the two anchors was announced, a dispute erupted over who was the owner of these artefacts. The protagonists were the governments of Australia, South Australia and Western Australia. The Australian Government argued that it was in the national interest for it to own the anchors, South Australia argued the significance of the anchors as a part of the sloop that charted most of its coastline, while Western Australia argued that the anchors were found in its waters. The dispute was resolved when the Australian government took ownership of both anchors in April 1973, with the best bower anchor being subsequently gifted to South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;’Keep Anchors here’, ''The Esperance Advertiser'', 12 January 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;’After 170 years the battle begins for Flinders’ anchors’, ''The Australian'', 16 March 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;’Let’s pull together to keep anchors’, ''The News'' (Adelaide), 26 March 1973, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=success&gt;{{cite news|title=SA succeeds in claim to anchor|publisher=The Advertiser|date=14 April 1973|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display==
In 1974, after completion of the conservation process at the [[Western Australian Museum]], the anchors were handed over to the Australian Government. The best bower anchor was officially presented to the South Australian Government on 1 March 1974 and was immediately placed on display at the [[Art Gallery of South Australia]].&lt;ref name=SAgetsanchor/&gt; In 1986, it was transferred to the collection of the then newly created [[South Australian Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;'Last 'voyage' for ship's anchor', ''The Advertiser'', 9 October 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stream anchor was retained by the Australian Government for the possible inclusion in the collection of a proposed national transport museum.&lt;ref name=success/&gt; This anchor was subsequently added to the collection of the [[National Museum of Australia]].&lt;ref name=NMA/&gt;

==Significance==
The Collection statement prepared by the South Australian Maritime Museum for the Best Bower Anchor advises the following:&lt;ref name=SAMM/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Matthew Flinders was the first to chart the then uncompleted coastline of South Australia and use the name [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] for the continent. The anchor is one of the few remaining physical relics linked to Flinders' exploration of the southern coastline and one of the earliest relics of European presence in South Australia.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Collection statement prepared by the National Museum of Australia for the Stream Anchor advises the following:&lt;ref name=NMA/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This collection highlights one of the important voyages of discovery and the naming of Australia by Matthew Flinders. Flinders circumnavigated Australia and confirmed its island status after many years of conjecture and uncertainty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftermath==
The positive public response to the successful UEC expedition was a major driver in the creation in 1974 by Seton and others of a dedicated amateur maritime archaeology organisation, the [[Society for Underwater Historical Research]] (SUHR).&lt;ref&gt;Brock, A.E., 1977, 'The Society for Underwater Historical Research of South Australia', In Green, J. (Ed.), 1977, ''Papers from the First Southern Hemisphere Conference on Maritime Archaeology'', Perth, Western Australia, Oceans Society of Australia, Australian Sports Publications, Melbourne, Victoria, pp. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, I.; (2001), 'Sport Diving on South Australian Shipwrecks', ''Soundings'' (2nd series), Vol. 2 No. 4 (October–December 2001), Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA, page 9. However, the founding year is stated as being 1975 rather than 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the approaches used by the UEC during the expedition such as seeking major corporate sponsorship, engagement with both political leaders and local communities, and the pro-active use of print and [[electronic media]] were continued in the work of the SUHR, particularly on projects concerning the ''[[Loch Vennachar]]'' and [[Water Witch (1835 cutter)|''Water Witch'']] shipwrecks.&lt;ref&gt;Marfleet, B. &amp; Hale, A.; (1977) 'Logistics of Loch Vennachar Expedition 1977', Annex A (4 pages) in ''Loch Vennachar Expedition Report'', Society for Underwater Historical Research, North Adelaide, SA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery, W.F., (1987), ''The Water Witch Wrecksite, A Report on the Identification, Survey &amp; Partial Recovery of the Wrecksite'', Department of Environment &amp; Planning, Adelaide SA, page xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The recovery of the anchors and their connection to the voyage of HMS ''Investigator'' is commemorated in the inclusion of the best bower anchor and the outline of the Australian continent on the SUHR emblem.&lt;ref&gt;'Second Annual Report, September 1976', pp.2, in Cowan, David (editor), (2007), ''The Society for Underwater Historical Research – Publications 1974-2004'', Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[HTTP]] Strict Transport Security''' ('''HSTS''') is a web security policy mechanism that helps to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and [[session hijacking|cookie hijacking]]. It allows web servers to declare that web browsers (or other complying user agents) should interact with it using only secure [[HTTPS]] connections,&lt;ref name="https"&gt;HTTPS refers to HTTP layered over [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS/SSL). Such secured HTTP connections are denoted by the [[Uniform resource identifier|URI]] [[URI scheme|scheme name]] of "https", and this protocol stack is often colloquially referred to as the "HTTPS protocol".&lt;/ref&gt; and never via the insecure HTTP protocol. HSTS is an [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] [[Internet standard|standards track]] protocol and is specified in RFC 6797.

The HSTS Policy is communicated by the server to the user agent via an [[HTTPS]] response [[List of HTTP header fields|header]] field named "&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Strict-Transport-Security&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;".&lt;ref name="mdn-security"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security|title=Strict-Transport-Security|website=[[MDN Web Docs]]|publisher=[[Mozilla]]|language=en-US|access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; HSTS Policy specifies a period of time during which the user agent should only access the server in a secure fashion.&lt;ref name="hsts-policy"&gt;{{Cite IETF|title=HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)|sectionname=HSTS Policy|rfc=6797|last1=Hodges|first1=Jeff|last2=Jackson|first2=Collin|last3=Barth|first3=Adam|date=November 2012|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]|section-url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-5.2|access-date=31 January 2018|doi=10.17487/RFC6797}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the HSTS HTTP Header is only recognized when sent over an HTTPS connection, websites can still allow users to interact with the website using HTTP, to allow compatibility with non-HTTPS user agents.

== Specification history ==
The HSTS specification was published as RFC 6797 on 19 November 2012 after being approved on 2 October 2012 by the [[IESG]] for publication as a [[Internet Standard#Proposed Standard|Proposed Standard]] [[Request for Comments|RFC]].&lt;ref name="hsts-ps-rfc-approval-iesg-msg"&gt;{{cite web
| url = https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/websec/current/msg01401.html

| date = 2 Oct 2012
| accessdate = 2 Oct 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The authors originally submitted it as an [[Internet-Draft]] on 17 June 2010. With the conversion to an Internet-Draft, the specification name was altered from "Strict Transport Security" (STS) to "HTTP Strict Transport Security", because the specification applies only to [[HTTP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = //www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hasmat/current/msg00025.html

| date = 30 June 2010
| accessdate = 22 July 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HTTP response header field defined in the HSTS specification however remains named "Strict-Transport-Security".

The last so-called "community version" of the then-named "STS" specification was published on 18 December 2009, with revisions based on community feedback.&lt;ref name="STS-draft-spec-2"&gt;{{cite web
| url = //lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2009Dec/att-0048/draft-hodges-strict-transport-sec-06.plain.html
| title = Strict Transport Security -06
| date = 18 December 2009
| accessdate = 23 December 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original draft specification by Jeff Hodges from [[PayPal]], Collin Jackson, and Adam Barth was published on 18 September 2009.&lt;ref name="draft-spec"&gt;{{cite web
| url = //lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2009Sep/att-0051/draft-hodges-strict-transport-sec-05.plain.html
| title = Strict Transport Security -05
| date = 18 September 2009
| accessdate = 19 November 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HSTS specification is based on original work by Jackson and Barth as described in their paper “ForceHTTPS: Protecting High-Security Web Sites from Network Attacks”.&lt;ref name="forcehttps-paper"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 19 November 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, HSTS is the realization of one facet of an overall vision for improving web security, put forward by Jeff Hodges and Andy Steingruebl in their 2010 paper ''The Need for Coherent Web Security Policy Framework(s)''.&lt;ref name="web-sec-policy-frmwk"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== HSTS mechanism overview ==
A server implements an HSTS policy by supplying a header over an HTTPS connection (HSTS headers over HTTP are ignored).&lt;ref name="mdn-security"/&gt; For example, a server could send a header such that future requests to the domain for the next year (max-age is specified in seconds; 31,536,000 is equal to one non-leap year) use only HTTPS: &lt;code&gt;Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000&lt;/code&gt;.

When a web application issues HSTS Policy to user agents, conformant user agents behave as follows (RFC 6797):&lt;ref name="hsts-mech"&gt;{{cite web
| url = https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-5
| title = Section 5. HSTS Mechanism Overview

| publisher = IETF

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Automatically turn any insecure links referencing the web application into secure links. (For instance, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://example.com/some/page/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will be modified to &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://example.com/some/page/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; ''before'' accessing the server.)
# If the security of the connection cannot be ensured (e.g. the server's [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] [[Public key certificate|certificate]] is not trusted), the user agent must terminate the connection (RFC 6797 section 8.4, Errors in Secure Transport Establishment) and should not allow the user to access the web application (section 12.1, No User Recourse).

The HSTS Policy helps protect web application users against some passive ([[eavesdropping]]) and active network [[Attack (computing)|attacks]].&lt;ref name="hsts-threats-addressed"&gt;{{cite web
| url = https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-2.3
| title = 2.3. Threat Model

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[man-in-the-middle attack]]er has a greatly reduced ability to intercept requests and responses between a user and a web application server while the user's browser has HSTS Policy in effect for that web application.

== Applicability ==
The most important security vulnerability that HSTS can fix is SSL-stripping [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s, first publicly introduced by [[Moxie Marlinspike]] in his 2009 BlackHat Federal talk "New Tricks For Defeating SSL In Practice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-09/Marlinspike/BlackHat-DC-09-Marlinspike-Defeating-SSL.pdf |title=New Tricks For Defeating SSL In Practice |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|MFol6IMbZ7Y|Defeating SSL Using Sslstrip}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSL (and [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]]) stripping attack works by transparently converting a secure [[HTTPS]] connection into a plain HTTP connection. The user can see that the connection is insecure, but crucially there is no way of knowing whether the connection ''should'' be secure. Many websites do not use TLS/SSL, therefore there is no way of knowing (without prior knowledge) whether the use of plain HTTP is due to an attack, or simply because the website hasn't implemented TLS/SSL. Additionally, no warnings are presented to the user during the downgrade process, making the attack fairly subtle to all but the most vigilant. Marlinspike's sslstrip tool fully automates the attack.

HSTS addresses this problem&lt;ref name="hsts-threats-addressed" /&gt; by informing the browser that connections to the site should always use TLS/SSL. The HSTS header can be stripped by the attacker if this is the user's first visit. [[Google Chrome]], [[Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]], [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Microsoft Edge]] attempt to limit this problem by including a "pre-loaded" list of HSTS sites.&lt;ref name=preloading_hsts_chromium&gt;{{cite web
| url = https://www.chromium.org/sts
| author = Adam Langley
| title = Strict Transport Security
| work = The Chromium Projects
| date = 8 July 2010
| accessdate = 22 July 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=preloading_hsts_mozillla&gt;{{cite web
| url = https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2012/11/01/preloading-hsts/
| author = David Keeler
| title = Preloading HSTS
| date = 1 November 2012
| accessdate = 6 February 2014
| work = Mozilla Security Blog
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iepreload" /&gt;
Unfortunately this solution cannot scale to include all websites on the internet. See [[HTTP Strict Transport Security#Limitations|limitations]], below.

HSTS can also help to prevent having one's [[HTTP cookie#Cookie theft and session hijacking|cookie-based website login credentials stolen]] by widely available tools such as [[Firesheep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://identitymeme.org/archives/2010/10/29/firesheep-and-hsts-http-strict-transport-security/
| author = Jeff Hodges
| title = Firesheep and HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
| date = 31 October 2010
| accessdate = 8 Mar 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because HSTS is time limited, it is sensitive to attacks involving shifting the victim's computer time e.g. using false [[Network Time Protocol|NTP]] packets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-14/materials/eu-14-Selvi-Bypassing-HTTP-Strict-Transport-Security.pdf | title=Bypassing HTTP Strict Transport Security | date=2014-10-17 | accessdate=2014-10-22 | author=Jose Selvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==

The initial request remains unprotected from active attacks if it uses an insecure protocol such as plain HTTP or if the [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] for the initial request was obtained over an [[insecure channel]].&lt;ref name="hsts-bootstrap-mitm"&gt;{{cite web
| url = https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-14.6
| title = Section 14.6. Bootstrap MITM Vulnerability
| work = RFC 6797
| publisher = IETF
| last = Hodges
| first = Jeff |author2=Jackson, Collin |author3=Barth, Adam
| date = November 2012
| accessdate = 21 November 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same applies to the first request after the activity period specified in the advertised HSTS Policy &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;max-age&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (sites should set a period of several days or months depending on user activity and behavior). [[Google Chrome]], [[Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]] and [[Internet Explorer]]/[[Microsoft Edge]] address this limitation by implementing a "HSTS preloaded list", which is a list that contains known sites supporting HSTS.&lt;ref name=preloading_hsts_chromium /&gt;&lt;ref name=preloading_hsts_mozillla /&gt;&lt;ref name="iepreload"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2015/02/16/http-strict-transport-security-comes-to-internet-explorer.aspx | title = HTTP Strict Transport Security comes to Internet Explorer | accessdate=16 February 2015 |author1=Bell, Mike |author2=Walp, David | date=February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list is distributed with the browser so that it uses HTTPS for the initial request to the listed sites as well. As previously mentioned, these pre-loaded lists cannot scale to cover the entire Web. A potential solution might be achieved by using [[Domain name system|DNS]] records to declare HSTS Policy, and accessing them securely via [[DNSSEC]], optionally with certificate fingerprints to ensure validity (which requires running a validating resolver to avoid [[last mile]] issues).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=HTTP Strict Transport Security | url=https://simon.butcher.name/archives/2011/09/11/HTTP-Strict-Transport-Security | author=Butcher, Simon | date=11 September 2011 | accessdate=27 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Junade Ali has noted that HSTS is often ineffective against the use of phony domains; by using DNS-based attacks, it is possible for a Man-in-the-Middle interceptor to serve traffic from an artificial domain which is not on the HSTS Preload list&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;, this is made possible by DNS Spoofing Attacks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maksutov|first1=A. A.|last2=Cherepanov|first2=I. A.|last3=Alekseev|first3=M.

Even with an "HSTS preloaded list", HSTS can't prevent advanced attacks against TLS itself, such as the [[BEAST (computer security)|BEAST]] or [[CRIME (security exploit)|CRIME]] attacks introduced by Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong. Attacks against TLS itself are [[Orthogonal#Computer science|orthogonal]] to HSTS policy enforcement.

See {{IETF RFC|6797}} for a discussion of overall HSTS security considerations.

=== Privacy issues ===

HSTS can be used to near-indelibly tag visiting browsers with recoverable identifying data ([[HTTP cookie#Supercookie|supercookies]]) which can persist in and out of browser "[[Privacy mode|incognito]]" privacy modes. By creating a web page that makes multiple HTTP requests to selected domains, for example if twenty browser requests to twenty different domains are used, theoretically over one million visitors can be distinguished (2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;) due to the resulting requests arriving via HTTP vs. HTTPS; the latter being the previously recorded binary "bits" established earlier via HSTS headers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/02/02/anatomy-of-a-browser-dilemma-how-hsts-supercookies-make-you-choose-between-privacy-or-security/|title=The HSTS super cookie forcing you to choose: "privacy or security?" -|work=sophos.com|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deployment best practices ==
Depending on the actual deployment there are certain threats (e.g. cookie injection attacks) that can be avoided by following best practices.

* HSTS hosts should declare HSTS policy at their top-level domain name. For example, an HSTS host at &lt;nowiki&gt;https://sub.example.com&lt;/nowiki&gt; should also answer with the HSTS header at &lt;nowiki&gt;https://example.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The header should specify the &lt;code&gt;includeSubDomains&lt;/code&gt; directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-websec-strict-transport-sec-14#page-16|title=HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) 6.1.2.|work=ietf.org|author=Hodges, et al.|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In addition to HSTS deployment, a host for &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.example.com&lt;/nowiki&gt; should include a request to a resource from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://example.com&lt;/nowiki&gt; to make sure that HSTS for the parent domain is set and protects the user from potential cookie injection attacks performed by a MITM that would inject a reference to the parent domain (or even &lt;nowiki&gt;http://nonexistentpeer.example.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;), which the attacker then would answer.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The '''Home Energy Resources Unit''' or Home Energy Recovery Unit (HERU) is a [[prototype]] [[kitchen appliance]] which is claimed to use [[household waste]] to generate [[energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-43643709 |title=New gadget turning waste into hot water |last=Gregory-Kumar |first=David |date=2018-04-04 |work=BBC News |access-date=2018-08-28 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Household waste, both organic and inorganic, is placed into a main chamber. Plastic and cardboard packaging as well as food waste can be inserted as fuel, and the waste does not need to be sorted or separated.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://uk.mobile.reuters.com/video/2018/07/02/machine-transforms-household-trash-into?videoId=441354971&amp;videoChannel=82|title=Machine transforms household trash into fuel|work=Reuters video|date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then goes through an eight-hour cycle. The chamber containing the waste is heated to 100° [[celsius]] to evaporate water and remove [[oxygen]]. The temperature is then increased and [[pyrolysis]] takes place. Oxygen is then re-introduced to allow [[incineration]] of the [[Pyrolysis#Coke, carbon, charcoals, and chars|pyrolised waste]] for [[water heating]]. After eight hours, a tankful of stored hot water is produced, and all plastic, cardboard and organic waste is reduced to [[gas]] and [[ash]]. The gas is then used in a domestic [[boiler]], and the ash can be flushed safely into an ordinary sewage system. Any glass or metal waste is left in a [[thermal cleaning|clean state]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-43643709|title=New kitchen appliance turning rubbish into hot water|website=BBC.co.uk|date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmodo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/04/personal-incinerators-are-one-mans-vision-of-the-future/|title=Personal Incinerators Are One Man's Vision of the Future|website=Gizmodo.co.uk|date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The invention won a grant from the [[UK Government]]'s [[Innovate UK]] Energy Game Changer Fund.&lt;ref name="utility"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://utilityweek.co.uk/worlds-first-efw-hybrid-boiler-gets-government-backing/|title=World’s first EFW hybrid boiler gets government backing|website=utilityweek.co.uk|date=16 March 2017|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology won the 2017 Environment and Sustainability Group Prize of the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]].&lt;ref name="eesg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imeche.org/careers-education/scholarships-and-awards/energy-environment-and-sustainability-group-prize|title=Energy, Environment and Sustainability Group Prize|website=Institution of Mechanical Engineers|date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to purely directive [[management]] efforts that attempt either to manage or direct outcomes, knowledge [[ecosystem]]s espouse that knowledge [[strategy|strategies]] should focus more on enabling [[self-organization]] in response to changing environments.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The suitability between knowledge and problems confronted defines the degree of "fitness" of a knowledge ecosystem. Articles discussing such ecological approaches typically incorporate elements of [[complex adaptive systems]] theory.

== Key elements ==

To understand knowledge ecology as a productive operation, it is helpful to focus on the knowledge ecosystem that lies at its core. Like natural ecosystems, these knowledge ecosystems have inputs, throughputs and outputs operating in open exchange relationship with their environments. Multiple layers and levels of systems may be integrated to form a complete ecosystem. These systems consist of interlinked knowledge resources, databases, human experts, and artificial knowledge agents that collectively provide an online knowledge for anywhere anytime performance of organizational tasks. The availability of knowledge on an anywhere-anytime basis blurs the line between learning and work performance. Both can occur simultaneously and sometimes interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;
Paul Shrivastava. [http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/shrivast/KnowledgeEcology.html Knowledge Ecology: Knowledge Ecosystems for Business Education and Training]. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Key elements of networked knowledge systems&lt;ref&gt;
Homa Bahrami,J. Stuart Evans (2005). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/j6478760q7066588/ The Research Laboratory: Silicon Valley's Knowledge Ecosystem], in [https://books.google.com/books?id=OlFUPUIcHoMC Super-Flexibility for Knowledge Enterprises]. Springer
&lt;/ref&gt; include:

# '''Core Technologies''':&lt;ref&gt;
Manzalini, A.   Stavdas, A. (2008). [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4545635 A Service and Knowledge Ecosystem for Telco3.0-Web3.0 Applications]
&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge ecosystems operate on two types of technological core – one dealing with the content or substantive knowledge of the industry, and the other involving computer hardware and software and telecommunications, that serve as the "procedural technology" of operations. These technologies provide knowledge management capabilities that are far beyond individual human capacity. In the business education and training context substantive technology would be knowledge of different business functions, tasks, processes products, R&amp;D, markets, finances and relations. Research, codification, documentation, publication and electronic sharing create this substantive knowledge. [[Communications]] between computers and among humans permit knowledge ecosystems to be interactive and responsive within the wider community and within its subsystems.
# '''Critical Interdependencies''':&lt;ref&gt;
Bray, David A., Croxson, Karen, Dutton, William H. and Konsynski, Benn, Sermo (2008). [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1016483 Sermo: A Community-Based, Knowledge Ecosystem]. Oll Distributed Problem-Solving Networks Conference, February 2008
&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational knowledge resides in a complex network of individuals, systems and procedures both inside and outside the organization. This network is established in the form of social and technological relationships. The relationships reflect vital interests and mutual histories. The elements of the network are dependent on each other for resources and mutual survival. Accessing and using this knowledge network involves understanding and maintaining the integrity of underlying relationships.
# '''Knowledge Engines and Agents''':&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This refers to the system of creating knowledge including the research and development processes, experts, operational managers/administrators, software systems, archival knowledge resources and databases.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational knowledge is converted into economic value through processes that involve action. These could be cognitive actions such as learning or deciding, or physical actions such as preparing a meal or writing a check, and social actions such as organizing or entertaining. Organizational tasks most often require all these and other types of actions to occur in a linked way for value to be created. They occur in the physical spaces, electronic spaces, economic transactions, and communicative exchanges of knowledge tasks. They contribute to achievement of organizational goals.

He received a master's degree in [[Near Eastern studies]] from the [[University of Chicago]]. However, as a response to the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s, Wang switched his interests to [[Asian American studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/fixers/reports/wangint.html|title=INTERVIEW WITH LING-CHI WANG, APRIL 1997 - The Fixers - FRONTLINE - PBS|website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[Wen Ho Lee]] spying allegations, Wang and an Asian American academic organization instituted a boycott of the two labs run by the [[University of California]], in [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]]. He also helped organize a [[class-action lawsuit]] against the labs in response to racial profiling allegations.

Wang led a movement expose the involvement of [[Republic of China (Taiwan)]]'s government role in the murder of [[Henry Liu]] in [[Daly City, California]] by [[Bamboo Union]] agents.

Below is a '''list of [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]] content in foods''', organised by food group and given in measurements of grams of protein per 100 grams of food portion.  Most natural foods are composed largely of water.  The reduction of water content has the greatest effect of increasing protein as a proportion of the overall mass of the foodstuff in question.  
It is to be noted that not all protein is equally digestible. Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score ([[PDCAAS]]) is a method of evaluating the protein quality based on the amino acid requirements of humans.

In [[semiotics]], a '''modality''' is a particular way in which [[information]] is to be [[Encode (semiotics)|encoded]] for presentation to humans, i.e. to the type of [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] and to the status of reality ascribed to or claimed by a sign, text, or genre. It is more closely associated with the semiotics of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]] (1839–1914) than [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913) because [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] is conceived as an effect of a set of signs. In the Peircean model, a reference is made to an ''object'' when the sign (or ''representamen'') is interpreted recursively by another sign (which becomes its ''[[interpretant]]''), a conception of meaning that does in fact imply a classification of sign types.

==Discussion of sign-type==
The [[psychology of perception]] suggests the existence of a common cognitive system that treats all or most sensorily conveyed meanings in the same way.{{fact | date = January 2017 | reason = Unclear and un-cited.}} If all signs must also be objects of perception, there is every reason to believe that their modality will determine at least part of their nature. Thus, the sensory modalities will be [[visual]], [[Hearing (sense)|auditory]], [[Touch|tactile]], [[olfactory]], [[gustatory]], [[kinesthetic]], etc. A list of sign types would include: [[writing]], [[symbol]], index, [[image]], [[map]], [[graphics|graph]], [[diagram]], etc. Some combinations of signs can be multi-modal, i.e. different types of signs grouped together for effect. But the distinction between a ''medium'' and a modality should be clarified: 
*''text'' is a medium for presenting the modality of natural language; 
*''image'' is both a medium and a modality;
*''music'' is a modality for the auditory media.
So, the ''modality'' refers to a certain type of information and/or the representation format in which information is stored. The ''medium'' is the means whereby this information is delivered to the senses of the interpreter. Natural language is the primary modality, having many invariant properties across the auditory media as spoken language, the visual media as written language, the tactile media as [[Braille]], and kinetic media as [[sign language]]. When meaning is conveyed by spoken language, it is converted into sound waves broadcast by the speaker and received by another's ears. Yet this [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] cannot be divorced from the visual evidence of the speaker's manner and [[gestures]], and the general awareness of the physical location and its possible [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] significance. Similarly, meaning that is contained in a visual form cannot be divorced from the [[iconicity]] and implications of the form. If handwritten, is the writing neat or does it evidence emotion in its style. What type of paper is used, what colour ink, what kind of writing instrument: all such questions are relevant to an interpretation of the significance of what is represented. But images are distinguishable from natural language. For [[Roland Barthes]] (1915–80), language functions with relatively determinate meanings whereas images "say" nothing. Nevertheless, there is a [[rhetoric]] for arranging the parts that are to signify, and an emerging, if not yet generally accepted, [[syntax]] that articulates their parts and binds them into an effective whole.  Rhetorician Thomas Rosteck defined rhetoric "as the use of language and other symbolic systems to make sense of our experiences, construct our personal and collective identities, produce meaning, and prompt action in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rhetorical Theory: An Introduction|last = Borchers|first = Timothy|publisher = |year = 2006|isbn = 978-1-57766-731-5|location = Belmont, CA|pages = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33407">'''Nutriepigenomics''' is the study of food [[nutrient]]s and their effects on human health through [[epigenetic]] modifications.  There is now considerable evidence that nutritional imbalances during [[gestation]] and [[lactation]] are linked to [[non-communicable disease]]s, such as [[obesity]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], and [[cancer]].  If metabolic disturbances occur during critical time windows of development, the resulting epigenetic alterations can lead to permanent changes in tissue and organ structure or function and predispose individuals to disease.&lt;ref name="Gallou"&gt;Gallou-Kabani C, Vige A, Gross MS, Junien C. Nutri-epigenomics: Lifelong remodelling of our epigenomes by nutritional and metabolic factors and beyond. Clin Chem Lab Med. 2007;45(3):321-7 {{DOI|10.1515/CCLM.2007.081}} {{PMID|17378726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[Epigenetics]] relates to heritable changes in [[gene]] function that occur independently of alterations in primary [[DNA]] sequence.  Two major epigenetic mechanisms implicated in nutriepigenomics are [[DNA methylation]] and [[histone]] modification.  DNA methylation in [[gene promoter]] regions usually results in [[gene silencing]] and influences gene expression.  While this form of gene silencing is extremely important in development and cellular differentiation, aberrant DNA methylation can be detrimental and has been linked to various disease processes, such as cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Berdasco M, Esteller M. Aberrant epigenetic landscape in cancer: How cellular identity goes awry. Dev Cell. 2010 Nov 16;19(5):698-711 {{DOI|10.1016/j.devcel.2010.10.005}} {{PMID|21074720}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The methyl groups used in DNA methylation are often derived from dietary sources, such as folate and [[choline]], and explains why diet can have a significant impact on methylation patterns and gene expression.&lt;ref name="Pozharny"&gt;Pozharny Y, Lambertini L, Clunie G, Ferrara L, Lee MJ. Epigenetics in women's health care. Mt Sinai J Med. 2010 Mar;77(2):225-35 {{DOI|10.1002/msj.20176}} {{PMID|20309920}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gene silencing can also be reinforced through the recruitment of [[histone deacetylases]] to decrease transcriptional activation.  Conversely, [[histone acetylation]] induces transcriptional activation to increase gene expression.  Dietary components can influence these epigenetic events, thereby altering gene expression and disturbing functions such as appetite control, metabolic balance and fuel utilization.&lt;ref name="Gallou"/&gt;

Various genetic sequences can be targeted for epigenetic modification.  A [[transcriptome]]-wide analysis in mice found that a protein-restricted (PR) diet during gestation resulted in differential gene expression in approximately 1% of the fetal genes analyzed (235/22,690).  Specifically, increased expression was seen in genes involved in the [[p53]] pathway, [[apoptosis]], negative regulators of cell metabolism, and genes related to epigenetic control.&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe CP, Goyal R, Holweger JD, Longo LD. Placental gene expression responses to maternal protein restriction in the mouse. Placenta. 2009 May;30(5):411-7 {{DOI|10.1016/j.placenta.2009.03.002}} {{PMID|19362366}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional studies have investigated the effect of a PR-diet in rats and found changes in promoter methylation of both the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] and [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor]] (PPAR).&lt;ref&gt;Lillycrop KA, Phillips ES, Torrens C, Hanson MA, Jackson AA, Burdge GC. Feeding pregnant rats a protein-restricted diet persistently alters the methylation of specific cytosines in the hepatic PPAR alpha promoter of the offspring. Br J Nutr. 2008 Aug;100(2):278-82 {{DOI|10.1017/S0007114507894438}} {{PMID|18186951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lillycrop KA, Slater-Jefferies JL, Hanson MA, Godfrey KM, Jackson AA, Burdge GC. Induction of altered epigenetic regulation of the hepatic glucocorticoid receptor in the offspring of rats fed a protein-restricted diet during pregnancy suggests that reduced DNA methyltransferase-1 expression is involved in impaired DNA methylation and changes in histone modifications. Br J Nutr. 2007 Jun;97(6):1064-73 {{DOI|10.1017/S000711450769196X}} {{PMID|17433129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altered expression of these receptors can result in elevated blood glucose levels and affect lipid and carbohydrate metabolism.&lt;ref name="Pozharny"/&gt; Feeding a PR-diet to pregnant and/or lactating mice also increased expression of [[glucokinase]], [[acetyl-CoA carboxylase]], [[PPARα]], and [[acyl-CoA oxidase]].&lt;ref name="Burdge"&gt;Burdge GC, Lillycrop KA. Nutrition, epigenetics, and developmental plasticity: Implications for understanding human disease. Annu Rev Nutr. 2010 Aug 21;30:315-39 {{DOI|10.1146/annurev.nutr.012809.104751}} {{PMID|20415585}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes in expression were reportedly due to epigenetic regulation of either the gene promoter itself, or promoters of transcription factors that regulate gene expression.  Additional genes that have been shown, either by [[in vitro]] or [[in vivo]] studies, to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms include [[leptin]], [[SOCS3]], [[glucose transporter]] (GLUT)-4, [[POMC]], [[Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2|11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2]] and [[Corticotrophin-releasing factor|corticotrophin releasing hormone]].  Epigenetic modification of these genes may lead to “metabolic programming” of the fetus and result in long-term changes in [[metabolism]] and energy homeostasis.&lt;ref name="Tamashiro"&gt;Tamashiro KL, Moran TH. Perinatal environment and its influences on metabolic programming of offspring. Physiol Behav. 2010 Jul 14;100(5):560-6 {{DOI|10.1016/j.physbeh.2010.04.008}} {{PMID|20394764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutriepigenomics and development==
The period of development in which the nutritional imbalance occurs is very important in determining which disease-related genes will be affected.  Different organs have critical developmental stages, and the time point at which they are compromised will predispose individuals to specific diseases.&lt;ref name="hanley"&gt;Hanley B, Dijane J, Fewtrell M, Grynberg A, Hummel S, Junien C, Koletzko B, Lewis S, Renz H, Symonds M, Gros M, Harthoorn L, Mace K, Samuels F, van Der Beek EM. Metabolic imprinting, programming and epigenetics - a review of present priorities and future opportunities. Br J Nutr. 2010 Jul;104 Suppl 1:S1-25 {{DOI|10.1017/S0007114510003338}} {{PMID|20929595}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Epigenetic modifications that occur during development may not be expressed until later in life depending on the function of the gene.&lt;ref name="Pozharny"/&gt; While the majority of studies implicate [[prenatal]] and [[perinatal]] periods as critical time windows, some research has shown that nutritional intake during [[adulthood]] can also affect the epigenome.

===Prenatal ===
[[Developmental plasticity]] is the process in which fetuses adapt to their environment.  Environmental cues, including dietary components, present in the [[in utero]] environment can induce significant changes in the expression of the genome through epigenetic modifications.&lt;ref name="Burdge"/&gt; Fetal developmental plastic responses can cause changes in lean body mass, endocrinology, blood flow and vascular loading, and lead to increased risk of various diseases in adulthood.

====Low Birth Weight ====
Fetal exposure to calcium, folate, magnesium, high or low protein, and zinc have all been associated with birth weight.&lt;ref name="hanley"/&gt; Numerous studies have investigated the link between birth weight and risk of disease and have found that low birth weight is significantly associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and type-2 diabetes.  Most importantly, these associations occurred after adjusting for lifestyle factors, implying a genetic basis for onset of disease.&lt;ref name = "Simmons"&gt;Simmons R. Epigenetics and maternal nutrition: Nature v. nurture. Proc Nutr Soc. 2010 Nov 29:1-9 {{PMID|21110912}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Impaired [[insulin]] secretion is associated with low birth weight and can lead to insulin resistance as babies accumulate body fat.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen CB, Storgaard H, Dela F, Holst JJ, Madsbad S, Vaag AA. Early differential defects of insulin secretion and action in 19-year-old caucasian men who had low birth weight. Diabetes. 2002 Apr;51(4):1271-80 {{PMID|11916955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies using intrauterine growth retarded (IUGR) rats have found that growth inhibition can lead to decreased expression of Pdx1 transcription factor, which is essential for differentiation and function of pancreatic beta cells.&lt;ref&gt;Park JH, Stoffers DA, Nicholls RD, Simmons RA. Development of type 2 diabetes following intrauterine growth retardation in rats is associated with progressive epigenetic silencing of Pdx1. J Clin Invest. 2008 Jun;118(6):2316-24 {{PMID|18464933}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Decreased histone acetylation at the proximal promoter of Pdx1 is responsible for reduced Pdx1 expression and subsequently results in a cascade of histone deacetylation and methylation events that can result in type-2 diabetes.
[[Image:Histones.jpg|thumb|alt=PDX1 is an essential transcription factor for proper development and function of pancreatic [[beta cells]].  Poor maternal nutrition is linked to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and low birth weight, and can result in decreased expression of PDX1 through decreased histone acetylation at the PDX1 proximal promoter.  Reduced expression of PDX1 may result in improper formation of beta cells and increase the risk of type-2 diabetes in the offspring.|Development of type 2 diabetes following intrauterine growth retardation in rats is associated with progressive epigenetic silencing of Pdx1]]

==== Obesity ====
Obesity during pregnancy and high-fat maternal diets both show strong associations with obesity in offspring.  As the number of overweight reproductive-age women increases, the number of overweight children and infants also increases.&lt;ref name="Simmons"/&gt;  It has been postulated that maternal obesity causes an accumulation of fat in fetal [[adipose tissue]] (adiposity) and predisposes babies for obesity in childhood and adulthood.&lt;ref name = "Simmons"/&gt;  Animal studies have shown that maternal overnutrition may impact brain development and cause disruptions to programming of the [[hypothalamus]].  Offspring that were exposed to a high-fat or high-caloric maternal diet had increased levels of insulin, glucose and leptin.  It is hypothesized that these elevations are due to disturbances in the complex neuronal network that includes the neuropeptide Y (NPY) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) pathways.&lt;ref name="Tamashiro"/&gt;  This altered neuronal signaling can consequently impact food-intake behavior and lead to diet-induced obesity in adulthood.  While epigenetic modifications are most likely involved in the development of obesity, the specific target genes have yet to be identified.  Genes involved in adipogenesis, such as fibroblast growth-factor-2, phosphatase and tensin homologue, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A and oestrogen receptor-alpha, possess multiple [[CpG islands]] in their promoter sites and may act as epigenetic targets.&lt;ref name="Campion"&gt;Campion J, Milagro FI, Martinez JA. Individuality and epigenetics in obesity. Obes Rev. 2009 Jul;10(4):383-92 {{DOI|10.1111/j.1467-789X.2009.00595.x}} {{PMID|19413700}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, it has been shown that prenatal exposure to a hypomethylating agent, such as [[bisphenol A]] (BPA), is associated with increased body weight and suggests modified DNA methylation as a mechanism for increasing susceptibility to obesity.&lt;ref name="Campion"/&gt;

==== Folate ====
It has long been realized that maternal folate intake during pregnancy is linked to fetal development and growth, and can reduce the risk of serious birth defects.  Folate is a source of [[S-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM), which is used to supply DNA methyltransferases with methyl groups.  Therefore, changes in folate supply have a substantial effect on DNA methylation patterns.  Low levels of folate are associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery, poor growth of the placenta and uterus, and intrauterine growth retardation.&lt;ref name="Pozharny"/&gt;  Several complex diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases and [[autism]] have also been linked to maternal folate status.  Based on animal studies it has been hypothesized that reduced folate intake could increase the risk of [[neural tube defects]] by reducing the amount of methylayed DNA during cranial neural tube closure.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlevy LP, Burren KA, Mills K, Chitty LS, Copp AJ, Greene ND. Integrity of the methylation cycle is essential for mammalian neural tube closure. Birth Defects Res A Clin Mol Teratol. 2006 Jul;76(7):544-52 {{DOI|10.1002/bdra.20286}} {{PMID|16933307}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently it was discovered that folate protection from congenital heart defects is linked to epigenetics and Wnt signaling.  Multiple environmental factors target the [[Wnt signaling pathway]] during embryogenesis and can cause misregulation of the pathway.  [[Folic acid]] metabolism generates SAM, thereby altering the methylation states of histones H3K9, H3K4, and H3K27 and genetically altering Wnt signaling.&lt;ref&gt;Linask KK, Huhta J. Folate protection from congenital heart defects linked with canonical wnt signaling and epigenetics. Curr Opin Pediatr. 2010 Oct;22(5):561-6 {{DOI|10.1097/MOP.0b013e32833e2723}} {{PMID|20844350}} .&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently a [[Blind experiment|double-blind]] placebo controlled trial of high dose [[Folinic acid|Folinic Acid]] (Leucovorin Calcium) demonstrated efficacy at improving verbal communication in children with [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frye|first=R. E.|last2=Slattery|first2=J.|last3=Delhey|first3=L.|last4=Furgerson|first4=B.|last5=Strickland|first5=T.|last6=Tippett|first6=M.|last7=Sailey|first7=A.|last8=Wynne|first8=R.|last9=Rose|first9=S.|date=2016-10-18|title=Folinic acid improves verbal communication in children with autism and language impairment: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial|url=http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/mp2016168a.html?cookies=accepted|journal=Molecular Psychiatry|language=en|doi=10.1038/mp.2016.168|issn=1476-5578|pmid=27752075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perinatal ===
Another critical developmental time window is the perinatal period, the time period immediately before and after birth.   It has been shown that maternal diet in late pregnancy and an infant’s diet in the beginning weeks can all have significant impacts on gene expression. Therefore, perinatal nutrition is both late-stage ''in utero'' nutrition and lactation.

==== Bone health ====
Bone mass and the development of [[osteoporosis]] have been studied in relation to perinatal nutrition.  An important factor to consider when investigating perinatal nutrition is whether the baby was [[breastfeeding|breast-fed]] or formula-fed.  Studies have shown that breast-fed babies have increased bone mass compared to those were not breast-fed, and that this small increase in bone mass during a period of critical development could potentially program the skeleton to continue along a “healthy” growth trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;Jones G, Dwyer T. Birth weight, birth length, and bone density in prepubertal children: Evidence for an association that may be mediated by genetic factors. Calcif Tissue Int. 2000 Oct;67(4):304-8 {{PMID|11000344}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been shown that maternal [[vitamin D]] insufficiency during late pregnancy is associated with reduced bone size and mineral mass in late childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Javaid MK, Crozier SR, Harvey NC, Gale CR, Dennison EM, Boucher BJ, Arden NK, Godfrey KM, Cooper C, Princess Anne Hospital Study Group. Maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy and childhood bone mass at age 9 years: A longitudinal study. Lancet. 2006 Jan 7;367(9504):36-43 {{PMID|16399151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peak bone mass has shown to be a good predictor of risk of fracture and osteoporosis, with even a small increase in peak bone mass resulting in a much lower risk of bone fracture.&lt;ref name="hanley"/&gt; Research shows that genetic markers explain only a small proportion of variation in bone mass and risk of fracture.  Therefore, healthy bone programming is most likely influenced by various epigenetic mechanisms, such as imprinting of the growth promoting genes IGF-2, or changes to the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA).&lt;ref&gt;Cooper C, Harvey N, Cole Z, Hanson M, Dennison E. Developmental origins of osteoporosis: The role of maternal nutrition. Adv Exp Med Biol. 2009;646:3h1-9 {{PMID|19536660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neurodevelopment ====
Imbalances in maternal nutrition can also have a significant effect on fetal [[neurodevelopment]].  Brain development occurs most rapidly during fetal development and infancy, and research has shown that exposure to certain environmental conditions can have long-lasting effects on [[cognition]].  Specifically, n-3 [[fatty acids]], [[iodine]], [[iron]] and [[choline]] have been shown to influence brain development and impact cognitive ability and behavior.  The greatest evidence for a link between nutrition and neurodevelopment comes from studies that show low birth weight associated with low IQ and increased risk of [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards M, Hardy R, Kuh D, Wadsworth ME. Birth weight and cognitive function in the british 1946 birth cohort: Longitudinal population based study. BMJ. 2001 Jan 27;322(7280):199-203 {{PMID|11159613}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gunnell D, Harrison G, Whitley E, Lewis G, Tynelius P, Rasmussen F. The association of fetal and childhood growth with risk of schizophrenia. cohort study of 720,000 swedish men and women. Schizophr Res. 2005 Nov 15;79(2-3):315-22 {{PMID|16125903}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies suggest that breast-feeding promotes long-term neurodevelopment by providing the nutrients necessary for proper brain development.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas A. Programming by early nutrition: An experimental approach. J Nutr. 1998 Feb;128(2 Suppl):401S-6S {{PMID|9478036}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study in mice showed that choline-deficient diets during the late gestation period impaired fetal brain development, including decreased cell proliferation and reduced visual-spatial and auditory memory.&lt;ref&gt;Mehedint MG, Niculescu MD, Craciunescu CN, Zeisel SH. Choline deficiency alters global histone methylation and epigenetic marking at the Re1 site of the calbindin 1 gene. FASEB J. 2010 Jan;24(1):184-95 {{PMID|19752176}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cognitive changes appeared to be due to altered histone and DNA methylation patterns in the fetal [[hippocampus]], thus providing a link between maternal nutrition, epigenetics, and early brain development.

==== Type-1 diabetes ====
It has been postulated that breast-feeding may also protect against type-1 diabetes, with research showing that formula-fed infants are at an increased risk of developing islet [[autoantibodies]].  Individuals with type-1 diabetes experience a pre-clinical diabetes phase characterized by [[autoimmunity]] against [[pancreatic islets]].&lt;ref&gt;Eisenbarth GS. Type I diabetes mellitus. A chronic autoimmune disease. N Engl J Med. 1986 May 22;314(21):1360-8 {{DOI|10.1056/NEJM198605223142106}} {{PMID|3517648}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction of certain foods in the first few months of life, such as berries and cereal, is significantly associated with increased risk of islet autoantibody development compared to babies who are exposed to solid foods later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler AG, Schmid S, Huber D, Hummel M, Bonifacio E. Early infant feeding and risk of developing type 1 diabetes-associated autoantibodies. JAMA. 2003 Oct 1;290(13):1721-8 {{DOI|10.1001/jama.290.13.1721}} {{PMID|14519706}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the pathogenesis behind development of autoantibodies remains largely unknown, it is very probable that an epigenetic link exists between perinatal diet and risk of type-1 diabetes.&lt;ref name="hanley"/&gt;

=== Adulthood ===
The majority of research in nutriepigenomics has focused on nutritional imbalances during gestation and lactation periods.  However, foods that are consumed during adulthood can also impact gene expression and disease pathogenesis.  Cancer is the disease most commonly associated with adult nutrition and epigenetic modifications. DNA hypomethelation promotes cancer progression by allowing increased gene transcription, while hypermethylation can silence tumor suppressor genes and further promote uncontrolled [[cell division]] and [[tumor]] formation.  Compounds found in foods, such as [[genistein]] and [[tea polyphenols]], are able to regulate DNA methyltransferases and histone acetylation in cultured cancer cells and may provide protection against certain types of cancer.&lt;ref name="Campion"/&gt;  Other dietary compounds, such as [[diallyl disulfide]] present in garlic and [[sulforaphane]] present in cruciferous vegetables, have been associated with cancer prevention in clinical trials.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Davis CD, Ross SA. Dietary components impact histone modifications and cancer risk. Nutr Rev. 2007 Feb;65(2):88-94 {{PMID|17345961}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be due to their ability to inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes and prevent silencing of important regulatory genes.

== Transgenerational effects ==
{{main|Transgenerational epigenetics}}

Many believe epigenetic regulation is cleared during the [[fertilization]] process, yet more evidence for transgenerational effects (TGEs) are being revealed.&lt;ref name="Gallou"/&gt; These TGEs take place when the epigenetic regulatory patterns are not sufficiently erased during fertilization, possibly due to nutrition levels in previous generations. Later generations may be affected from caloric and protein restriction, high-fat interventions and endocrine disruption in earlier generations.&lt;ref name="Gallou"/&gt;  Differences within the nutritional behavior of the maternal rat are believed to cause malprogramming in the F1 generation and may then be passed to subsequent generations.&lt;ref name="Gallou"/&gt;   
Maternal rats fed a PR-diet during the entire length of pregnancy led to metabolic-related problems in the F1 and F2 generations, even with normal nutrition during the F1 pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Martin JF, Johnston CR, Han CT, Benyshek DC. Nutritional origins of insulin resistance: a rat model for diabetes-prone human populations. 2000. J Nutr. 130:741-44 {{PMID|10736323}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zambrano E, Martinez-Samayoa PM, Bautista CJ, Deas M, Guillen L, Rodriguez-Gonzalez GL, Guzman C, Larrea F &amp; Nathanielsz PW. Sex differences in transgenerational alterations of growth and metabolism in progeny (F2) of female offspring (F1) of rats fed a low protein diet during pregnancy and lactation. 2005. J Physiol (Lond.) 566:225-36 {{PMID|15860532}}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects have also been seen in the F3 generation depending on the length of protein restriction.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison M &amp; Langley-Evans SC. Intergenerational programming of impaired nephrogenesis and hypertension in rats following maternal protein restriction during pregnancy. 2009. Br. J. Nutr. 101: 1020-30 {{PMID|18778527}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benyshek"&gt;Benyshek DC, Johnston CS &amp; Martin JF. Glucose metabolism is altered in the adequately-nourished grand-offspring (F3 generation) of rats malnourished during gestation and perinatal life. 2006. Diabetologia. 49: 1117-19 {{PMID|16557373}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If protein restriction occurred solely during pregnancy, the F1 and F2 offspring had higher systolic blood pressure and lower nephron numbers, possibly predisposing them to hypertension.&lt;ref name="Benyshek"/&gt; Altered glucose utilization was detected in the grand-offspring of maternal rats fed a PR-diet during pregnancy and lactation, potentially resulting in diabetes later on in life &lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt;

[[Image:Transgenerational ProteinRestrictdiet.jpg|thumb|alt=Protein-restricted (PR) diets fed to maternal mice leads to transgenerational effects in the offspring, up to the F3 generation depending on the length of protein restriction. All offspring are adequately fed, i.e. are not on a PR-diet. Grey mice represent wild-type phenotypes and pink mice represent offspring with either a genetic predisposition to hypertension (maternal rat fed PR-diet during pregnancy) or diabetes (maternal rat fed PR-diet during pregnancy and lactation). Mechanisms behind PR-diets are only proposed, as further research is needed to confirm their exact pathways|Transgenerational effects of maternal protein restriction]]

Protein-restriction in the F0 generation led to hypomethylation of promoters involved in metabolism in the F1 and F2 generations, even though the F1 pregnant rat was given a normal diet.&lt;ref&gt;Burdge GC, Slater-Jefferies J, Torrens C, Phillips ES, Hanson MA &amp; Lillycrop KA. Dietary protein restriction of pregnant rats in the F0 generation induces altered methylation of hepatic gene promoters in the adult male offspring in the F1 and F2 generations. 2007. Br J Nutr 97(3): 435-9 {{DOI|10.1017/S0007114507352392}} {{PMID|17313703}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exact mechanism of this situation has yet to be elucidated; however, direct transmission is a distinct possibility, meaning the epigenetic marks were preserved during [[spermatogenesis]] and [[oogenesis]], when they are normally erased.

== Models used in nutriepigenomic studies ==
Most research to date use common rodent models to investigate the role of nutrition on [[phenotype]].&lt;ref name="Simmons"/&gt; Popular areas to investigate include IUGR studies, whereby rodents, and sometimes sheep, are subjected to a variety of nutritional conditions.  A model for studying IUGR in rodent was developed by Simmons ''et al.'' (2010) and is used to investigate type II diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;Boloker J, Gertz SJ &amp; Simmons RA. Gestational diabetes leads to the development of diabetes in adulthood in the rat. 2002. Diabetes. 51(5): 1499-1506 {{PMID|11978648}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The maternal rats have their uterine arteries ligated, causing altered use of glucose and insulin in the fetus and can therefore serve as a model for diabetes. These growth-retarded rats were found to be highly similar to human fetuses, as they both display symptoms such as lowered glucose and insulin levels.  [[Gestational diabetes]] may also be studied through chemical induction using [[streptozotocin]] treatment of the pregnant rats.&lt;ref name="Fernandez"&gt;Fernandez-Twinn DS &amp; Ozanne SE. Early life nutrition and metabolic programming. Ann N Y Acad Sci. Epub ahead of print 2010 Nov 11 {{PMID|21070247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streptozotocin can cause destruction of the beta cells within the pancreas depending on the concentration given.

The predominant means of investigating nutriepigenetics involves varying the nutritional conditions to which a subject is exposed to and monitoring the effects thereafter.  Restricting caloric and protein intake are the two most common methods.&lt;ref name="Fernandez"/&gt; A pregnant rodent may have their caloric intake reduced up to 30-50% of normal intake.  Protein restricted rodents are given 8-9% [[casein]], as opposed to control rats that are fed 20% casein. Micronutrients, such as zinc and iron, may also be restricted to investigate the effects on offspring. Additionally, rats fed diets lacking or including methyl donors are often used to study the effects of diet on epigenomics, as variations within the methylation of DNA are common means of silencing or expressing genes.&lt;ref&gt;Niculescu, MD &amp; Zeisel, SH. Diet, methyl donors and DNA methylation: interactions between dietary folate, methionine and choline. 2002. J Nutr. 132, 23335-23355 {{PMID|12163687}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Supplementing maternal mice with folic acid, [[vitamin B12]], choline and [[betaine]] leads to increased levels of DNA methylation at CpG sites and causes a coat color change.&lt;ref&gt;Waterland, R. A. &amp; Jirtle, R. L. Transposable elements: targets for early nutritional effects on epigenetic gene regulation. 2003. Mol. Cell. Biol. 23, 5293–5300 {{DOI|10.1128/MCB.23.15.5293-5300.2003}} {{PMID|12861015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an example of epigenetically modifiable loci called a “metastable epiallele”, of which only a few have been identified.  The above is an example of the “agouti” gene locus, whereby the insertion of a [[transposable element]] upstream to the Agouti gene is hypermethylated from the supplementation and causes a change in the mice's coat color. Diets containing higher carbohydrate and fat content attempt to mimic typical Western-style diets may also be used in nutriepigenetic studies.&lt;ref name="Simmons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernandez"/&gt;  Another method used is “catch-up”, where offspring of rats born to mothers subjected to various diets are subsequently cross-fostered to mothers fed normal diets.&lt;ref name="Fernandez"/&gt;

== Future directions ==
The possibilities of utilizing nutriepigenomics for intervention are quite expansive.  This can include preventative therapies, such as providing an optimal regime for nutrition during pregnancy and lactation.&lt;ref name="Fernandez"/&gt;  It is already common place for pregnant mothers to supplement their diets with choline and folate to prevent the development of neurological disabilities in the fetus.

[[Image:FAS Choline.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The nutriepigenetic pathway of maternal choline-deficient diets helps to elucidate the development of fetal alcohol syndrome. Pregnant rodents fed diets low in choline were found to give rise to offspring with diminished neurological capacity. This is similar to pregnant rodents whom were fed ethanol and were found to have alterations in the metabolism of 1-carbon compounds. This leads to diminished levels of methyl donors available for methylating DNA; thus allowing for overexpression of normally silenced genes causing neurological defects in their offspring.|The nutriepigenetic pathway of maternal choline-deficient diets helps to elucidate the development of fetal alcohol syndrome]]

A highly specific diet, termed an "EpiG diet," may be employed for an individual believed to be at higher risk of developing a metabolic disorder.&lt;ref name="Gallou"/&gt; These diets may include supplementation with methyl donors, such as folate. There are also many other natural compounds, such as [[resveratrol]], [[curcumin]] and green tea that have been termed “epigenetic modifiers”, as they have anti-cancer capabilities in addition to being used as treatments for metabolic diseases.&lt;ref name="Sziv"&gt;Sziv KS, Ndlovu MN, Haegeman G &amp; Vanden Berghe W . Nature or nurture: let food be your epigenetic medicine in chronic inflammatory disorders. 2010. Biochem. Pharmacol. 80(12):1816-32 {{DOI|10.1016/j.bcp.2010.07.029}} {{PMID|20688047}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the functions of these compounds still require long-term studies to evaluate their effect over time.

There also exists potential for therapeutic treatments that may correct metabolic disorders, such as type II diabetes.&lt;ref name="Fernandez"/&gt;  Components of garlic and [[cruciferous vegetables]] are known to possess [[HDAC inhibitors]] that modify the acetylation of histone proteins and may contain a protection against cancer.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;  These same compounds have also been implicated in [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS) and [[colon cancer]], as they may modify the histones normally implicated in these diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett M, Bermingham E, McNabb W, Bassett S, Armstrong K, Rounce J &amp; Roy N. Investigating micronutrients and epigenetic mechanisms in relation to inflammatory bowel disease. 2010. Mutat Res. 690(1): 71-80 {{DOI|10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2010.02.006}} {{PMID|20188748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elucidation of disease pathways is another future direction for nutriepigenomic studies.  For example, choline-deficient diets and alcohol metabolism during pregnancy may have very similar metabolic pathways.&lt;ref&gt;Zeisel S. What Choline Metabolism Can Tell Us About the Underlying Mechanisms of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. 2011 Mol Neurobiol 2011 Jan 25 epub {{DOI|10.1007/s12035-011-8165-5}} {{PMID|21259123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, animal studies using choline-restricted diets may assist in investigations of [[fetal alcohol spectrum disorders]].

When compared to studies of maternal transmission, investigations into the role of paternal diets are lacking.  A review demonstrated the nutrition of both parents do in fact play a role in determining the health of their offspring.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;Ferguson-Smith, AC &amp; Patti, ME. You are what your dad ate. Cell Metab. 2011. 13(2):115-7 {{DOI|10.1016/j.cmet.2011.01.011}} {{PMID|21284975}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[germ-line]] study reported paternal rats fed a high-fat diet led to insulin dysfunction in the F1 offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, S.F., Lin, R.C., Laybutt, D.R., Barres, R., Owens, J.A., and Morris, M.J. Chronic high-fat diet in fathers programs β-cell dysfunction in female rat offspring. 2010. Nature 467, 963–966 {{DOI|10.1038/nature09491}} {{PMID|20962845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While this likely occurs via epigenetic modifications similar to those postulated in the maternal diets, the exact mechanism remains to be defined.  Assessing the role of epigenetic mechanisms may be easier using paternal inheritance, as sperm transmits epigenetic and genetic information, whereas the female cells also transmit [[mitochondrial DNA]].&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4886">'''Operational availability''' in [[systems engineering]] is a measurement of how long a system has been available to use when compared with how long it should have been available to be used.

==Definition==
Operational availability is a management concept that evaluates the following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doni.daps.dla.mil/OPNAV.aspx|title=Opnav Instruction 4790.7: Maintenance Policy for United States Navy Ships|publisher=US Navy Operations|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215134909/http://doni.daps.dla.mil/OPNAV.aspx|archivedate=2013-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Diagnostic down time
* Criticality
* Fault isolation down time
* Logistics delay down time
* Corrective maintenance down time

Any failed item that is not corrected will induce operational failure. &lt;math&gt;A_o&lt;/math&gt; is used to evaluate that risk. Operational failure is unacceptable in any situation where the following can occur.
* Capital equipment loss
* Injury or loss of life
* Sustained failure to accomplish mission

In military acquisition, operational availability is used as one of the [[Key Performance Parameters]] in requirements documents, to form the basis for decision support analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url =  https://doni.documentservices.dla.mil/Directives/03000%20Naval%20Operations%20and%20Readiness/03-00%20General%20Operations%20and%20Readiness%20Support/3000.12A.pdf

==History==

Aircraft systems, ship systems, missile systems, and space systems have a large number of failure modes that must be addressed with limited resources.

Formal reliability modeling during development is required to prioritize resource allocation before operation begins. Estimated failure rates and logistics delay are used to identify the number of forward positioned spare parts required to avoid excessive down time. This is also used to justify the expense associated with redundancy.

Formal availability measurement is used during operation to prioritize management decisions involving upgrade resource allocation, manpower allocation, and spare parts planning.

== Principle ==

Operational availability is used to evaluate the following performance characteristic.

For a system that is expected to be available constantly, the below operational availability figures translate to the system being unavailable for approximately the following lengths of time (when all outages during a year are added together):

:&lt;math&gt; A_o = 0.9 \approx 877 \ hours \ down \ time \ per \ year&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; A_o = 0.99 \approx 87 \ hours \ down \ time \ per \ year&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; A_o = 0.999 \approx 8 \ hours \ down \ time \ per \ year&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; A_o = 0.9999 \approx 52 \ minutes \ down \ time \ per \ year&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; A_o = 0.99999 \approx 5 \ minutes \ down \ time \ per \ year&lt;/math&gt;

The following data is collected for maintenance actions while in operation to prioritize corrective funding.
* Diagnostic down time is required to identify the amount of time spent perform maintenance when [[fault reporting]] does not support [[condition-based maintenance]].
* Criticality identifies level of risk associated with loss of mission, injury or loss of life, and capitol equipment.
* Fault isolation down time is required to identify the amount of time spent locating a failure.
* Logistics delay down time is required to identify the amount of time required to obtain replacement parts or software.
* Corrective maintenance down time is required to identify the amount of time required to install and reconfigure replacement parts and software.

This data is applied to the [[reliability block diagram]] to evaluate individual availability reduction contributions using the following formulas.

:&lt;math&gt;A_{o}^{D} = \left( \frac{ Total \ Time }{Total \ Time + Diagnostic \ Down \ Time } \right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_{o}^{FI} = \left( \frac{ Total \ Time }{Total \ Time + Fault \ Isolation \ Down \ Time } \right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_{o}^{L} = \left( \frac{ Total \ Time }{Total \ Time + Logistics \ Down \ Time } \right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_{o}^{C} = \left( \frac{ Total \ Time }{Total \ Time + Corrective \ Down \ Time } \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Redundant items do not contribute to availability reduction unless all of the redundant components fail simultaneously.

Operational availability is the overall availability considering each of these contributions.

:&lt;math&gt;A_o = A_{o}^{D} \times A_{o}^{FI} \times A_{o}^{L} \times A_{o}^{C}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Policy analysis''' is a technique used in [[public administration]] to enable [[civil servant]]s, [[Activism|activists]], and others to examine and evaluate the available options to implement the goals of laws and elected officials. The process is also used in the administration of large organizations with complex policies. It has been defined as the process of "determining which of various [[Policy|policies]] will achieve a given set of goals in light of the relations between the policies and the goals."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Policy analysis can be divided{{by whom|date=April 2016}} into two major fields:&lt;ref name="Bührs93"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bührs, Ton |author2=Bartlett, Robert V. |title=Environmental Policy in New Zealand.

* Analysis {{em|of}} existing policy, which is analytical and descriptive – it attempts to explain policies and their development 
* Analysis {{em|for}} new policy, which is prescriptive – it is involved with formulating policies and proposals (for example: to improve social welfare)

The areas of interest and the purpose of analysis determine what types of analysis are conducted. A combination of two kinds of policy analyses together with [[program evaluation]] is defined as ''[[policy studies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hambrick, Ralph Jr. |last2= Bardach |first2= Eugene |last3= Chelimsky |first3= Eleanor |last4= Shadish |first4= William R. |last5= Deleon |first5= Peter |last6= Fischer |first6= Frank |last7= MacRae |first7= Duncan |last8= Whittington |first8= Dale |title= Review: Building the Policy Studies Enterprise: A Work in Progress |journal= Public Administration Review |volume= 58 |issue= 6 |pages= 533–9 |date= November–December 1998 |doi= 10.2307/977580|jstor= 977580}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy analysis is frequently deployed in the [[public sector]], but is equally applicable elsewhere, such as [[nonprofit organization]]s and [[non-governmental organization]]s.

&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s.

==Approaches==
Various approaches to policy analysis exist. The analysis ''for'' policy (and analysis ''of'' policy) is the central approach in [[social science]] and educational policy studies. It is linked to two different traditions of policy analysis and research frameworks. The approach of analysis ''for'' policy refers to research conducted for actual policy development, often commissioned by policymakers inside the bureaucracy (e.g., senior civil servants) within which the policy is developed. Analysis ''of'' policy is more of an academic exercise, conducted by academic researchers, professors and [[think tank]] researchers, who are often seeking to understand why a particular policy was developed at a particular time and assess the effects, intended or otherwise, of that policy when it was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Khorsandi Taskoh, Ali. [http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3340&amp;context=etd A Critical Policy Analysis of Internationalization in Postsecondary Education: An Ontario Case Study], ''The University of Western Ontario'', October 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three approaches that can be distinguished: the analysis-centric, the policy process, and the meta-policy approach.&lt;ref name="Bührs93"/&gt;

===Analysis-centric===
The analysis-centric (or "analycentric") approach focuses on individual problems and their solutions. Its scope is the micro-scale and its problem interpretation or problem resolution usually involves a technical solution. The primary aim is to identify the most effective and efficient solution in technical and economic terms (e.g. the most efficient allocation of resources).

===Policy process===
The policy process approach puts its focal point onto political processes and involved [[stakeholder analysis|stakeholders]]; its scope is the broader meso-scale and it interprets problems using a political lens (i.e., the interests and goals of elected officials). It aims at determining what processes, means and policy instruments (e.g., [[regulation]], [[legislation]], [[subsidy]]) are used. As well, it tries to explain the role and influence of stakeholders within the policy process &lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2015).  Making policy connections across scales using nexus analysis. In F.M. Hult &amp; D.C Johnson (Eds.), &lt;i&gt;Research methods in language policy and planning: A practical guide&lt;/i&gt; (pp. 217-231). Malden, MA: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;. In the 2010s, ''stakeholders'' is defined broadly to include citizens, community groups, non-governmental organizations, businesses and even opposing political parties. By changing the relative power and influence of certain groups (e.g., enhancing public participation and consultation), solutions to problems may be identified that have more "buy in" from a wider group. One way of doing this followed a [[heuristic]] model called the ''[[Policy#Policy cycle|policy cycle]]''. In its simplest form, the policy cycle, which is often depicted visually as a loop or circle, starts with the identification of the problem, proceeds to an examination of the different policy tools that could be used to respond to that problem, then goes on to the implementation stage, in which one or more policies are put into practice (e.g., a new regulation or subsidy is set in place), and then finally, once the policy has been implemented and run for a certain period, the policy is evaluated. A number of different viewpoints can be used during evaluation, including looking at a policy's effectiveness, [[cost-effectiveness]], value for money, outcomes or outputs.

===Meta-policy===
The meta-policy approach is a systems and context approach; i.e., its scope is the macro-scale and its problem interpretation is usually of a structural nature. It aims at explaining the contextual factors of the policy process; i.e., what the political, economic and socio-cultural factors are that influence it. As problems may result because of structural factors (e.g., a certain economic system or political institution), solutions may entail changing the structure itself.

==Methodology==
Policy analysis uses both [[qualitative methods]] and [[quantitative methods]]. Qualitative research includes [[case studies]] and interviews with community members. Quantitative research includes [[survey research]], [[statistical analysis]] (also called ''data analysis'') and [[model building]]. A common practice is to define the problem and evaluation criteria; identify and evaluate alternatives; and recommend a certain policy accordingly. Promotion of the best agendas are the product of careful "back-room" analysis of policies by ''[[a priori knowledge|a priori]]'' assessment and ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' evaluation.

===Dimensions for analyzing policies===
There are six dimensions to policy analysis categorized as the effects and implementation of the policy across a period of time. Also collectively known as "Durability" of the policy, which means the capacity in content of the policy to produce visible effective compatible change or results over time with robustness.&lt;ref&gt;Salamon, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Effects'''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Effectiveness''' || What effects does the policy have on the targeted problem?
|-
| '''Unintended effects'''&lt;ref&gt;Rychetnik et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt; || What are the [[unintended effects]] of this policy?
|-
| '''Equity'''&lt;ref&gt;Potvin et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; || What are the effects of this policy on different population groups?
|}

'''Implementation'''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Cost''' || What is the financial cost of this policy (some analysts also include [[tax credit]]s in this analysis)?
|-
| '''Feasibility''' || Is the policy technically feasible?
|-
| '''Acceptability'''&lt;ref&gt;Peters, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; || Do the relevant policy stakeholders view the policy as acceptable?
|}

The strategic effects dimensions can pose certain limitations due to data collection. However the analytical dimensions of effects directly influences acceptability. The degree of acceptability is based upon the plausible definitions of actors involved in feasibility. If the feasibility dimension is compromised, it will put the implementation at risk, which will entail additional costs. Finally, implementation dimensions collectively influence a policy's ability to produce results or impacts.

===Five-E approach===
One model of policy analysis is the "five-E approach", which consists of examining a policy in terms of:&lt;ref name="Kirst-Ashman"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bHQcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |series=Empowerment Series |title=Introduction to Social Work &amp; Social Welfare: Critical Thinking Perspectives |first=Karen K. |last=Kirst-Ashman |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=January 1, 2016 |pages=234–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Effectiveness: How well does it work (or how well will it be predicted to work)?
;Efficiency: How much work does or will it entail? Are there significant costs associated with this solution, and are they worth it?
;[[Ethics|Ethical]] considerations: Is it ethically and morally sound?  Are there [[unintended consequences]]?
;Evaluations of alternatives: How good is it compared to other approaches?  Have all the relevant other approaches been considered?
;Establishment of recommendations for positive change: What can actually be implemented? Is it better to amend, replace, remove, or add a policy?

===Framework===
Policies are considered as frameworks that can optimize the general well-being. These are commonly analyzed by legislative bodies and lobbyists. Every policy analysis is intended to bring an evaluative outcome. A systemic policy analysis is meant for in depth study for addressing a social problem. Following are steps in a policy analysis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jillian Jimenez|author2=Eileen Mayers Pasztor|author3=Ruth M. Chambers |author4=Cheryl Pearlman Fujii |title=Social Policy and Social Change: Toward the Creation of Social and Economic Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hU0XBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|date=2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4833-2415-9|pages=25–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Defining the problem assessed by the policy.
# Assessing policy objectives and its target populations.
# Studying effects of the policy.
# Policy implications: distribution of resources, changes in services rights and statuses, tangible benefits. 
# Alternative policies: surveying existing and possible policy models that could have addressed the problem better or parts of it which could make it effective.

==Evidence based models==
Many models exist to analyze the development and implementation of [[public policy]]. Analysts use these models to identify important aspects of policy, as well as explain and predict policy and its consequences. Each of these models are based upon the types of policies.

===Types===
* Government (e.g. federal, provincial, municipal)
* Policies adopted within public institutions (e.g. hospitals, child care centers, schools)
* Workplace (e.g. policies that govern employees and employee-manager relations)&lt;ref&gt;Kim Bergeron, Florence Morestin et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evidence supported models are:

===Governments===

Public policy is determined by a range of political institutions, which give policy [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] to policy measures. In general, the government applies policy to all citizens and monopolizes the use of force in applying or implementing policy (through government control of [[law enforcement]], [[court]] systems, [[imprisonment]] and [[armed forces]]). The [[legislature]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[judicial]] branches of government are examples of institutions that give policy legitimacy. Many countries also have independent, quasi-independent or [[arm's length]] bodies which, while funded by government, are independent from elected officials and political leaders. These organizations may include government [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]s, [[tribunal]]s, [[regulation|regulatory agencies]] and electoral commissions.

====Process model====
{{See also|Policy#Policy cycle|l1=Policy cycle}}

Policy creation is a process that typically follows a sequence of steps or stages:
* Identification of a problem (also called "problem definition") and demand for government action. Different stakeholders may define the same issue as different problems. For example, if [[homelessness|homeless people]] are using [[illegal drug]]s such as [[heroin]] in a city park, some stakeholders may define this as a [[law enforcement]] issue (which, in their view, could be best solved if police presence in the park is stepped up and if the individuals using illegal drugs are arrested and punished); on the other hand, other stakeholders may view this as a [[poverty]] and [[public health]] issue (which, in their view, could be best solved if [[public health nurse]]s and government [[medical doctor]]s and [[substance abuse]] counsellors were sent to the park to do [[outreach]] with the drug-using individuals, and encourage them to voluntarily enter "[[detoxification]]" or [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] programs).
* Agenda setting
* Formulation of policy proposals by various parties (e.g., citizen groups, congressional committees, [[think tank]]s, [[interest group]]s, [[lobby group]]s, [[non-governmental organization]]s).
* Policy selection/adoption and legal enactment of a selected policy by elected officials and/or houses of representatives. At this stage, '''policy legitimation''' is conferred upon the selected policy solution(s).
* Policy implementation, which involves [[civil servant]]s putting the selected policy option into practice. Depending on the choice made by the executive or legislative branch, this could involve creating new [[regulation]] (or [[Deregulation|removing existing regulations]]), creating new laws, creating a new government program or service, creating a new [[subsidy]] or [[grant (money)|grant]], etc.
* Policy [[evaluation]]. After the policy has been in place for a year or several years, [[civil servant]]s or an independent [[consulting firm]] assesses the policy, to see if the goals were achieved, if the policy was implemented effectively, etc.

This model, however, has been criticized for being overly linear and simplistic.&lt;ref&gt;Young, John and Enrique Mendizabal. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1127&amp;title=become-policy-entrepreneur-roma Helping researchers become policy entrepreneurs], [[Overseas Development Institute]], London, September 2009. &lt;!--accessed 07 October 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, stages of the policy process may overlap or never happen. Also, this model fails to take into account the multiple factors attempting to influence the process itself as well as each other, and the complexity this entails.

===For public institutions===

One of the most widely used model for public institutions are of [[Herbert A. Simon]], the father of rational models. It is also used by private corporations. However, many criticise the model due to characteristics of the model being impractical and relying on unrealistic assumptions. For instance, it is a difficult model to apply in the public sector because social problems can be very complex, ill-defined and interdependent. The problem lies in the thinking procedure implied by the model which is linear and can face difficulties in extraordinary problems or social problems which have no sequences of happenings.

====Rational model====
:''See [[Rational planning model]] for a fuller discussion''

The rational model of decision-making is a process for making sound decisions in policy-making in the public sector. Rationality is defined as “a style of behavior that is appropriate to the achievement of given goals, within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Herbert, Simon |title=[[Administrative Behavior]] |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |year=1976 |edition=3rd |isbn=0-684-83582-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note the model makes a series of assumptions, such as: 'The model must be applied in a system that is stable'; 'The government is a rational and unitary actor and that its actions are perceived as rational choices'; 'The policy problem is unambiguous'; 'There are no limitations of time or cost'.

Furthermore, in the context of the public sector policy models are intended to achieve maximum social gain. Simon identifies an outline of a step by step mode of analysis to achieve rational decisions. Ian Thomas describes Simon's steps as follows:

#Intelligence gathering — A comprehensive organization of data; potential problems and opportunities are identified, collected and analyzed.
#Identifying problems — Accounting for relevant factors.
#Assessing the consequences of all options — Listing possible consequences and alternatives that could resolve the problem and ranking the probability that each potential factor could materialize in order to give a correct priority to said factor in the analysis.
#Relating consequences to values — With all policies there will be a set of relevant dimensional values (for example, economic feasibility and environmental protection) and a set of criteria for appropriateness, against which performance (or consequences) of each option being responsive can be judged.
#Choosing the preferred option — The policy is brought through from fully understanding the problems, opportunities, all the consequences &amp; the criteria of the tentative options and by selecting an optimal alternative with consensus of involved actors.&lt;ref name=Thomas07&gt;{{cite book |editor=Thomas, Ian |title=Environmental Policy: Australian Practice in the Context of Theory |publisher=Federation Press |location=Sydney |year=2007 |isbn=1-86287-603-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model of rational decision-making has also proven to be very useful to several decision making processes in industries outside the public sphere. Nonetheless, there are some who criticize the rational model due to the major problems which can be faced &amp; which tend to arise in practice because social and environmental values can be difficult to quantify and forge consensus around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1005469411776 |author1=Morgan M.G. |author2=Kandlikar M. |author3=Risbey J. |author4=Dowlatabadi H. |title=Why Conventional Tools for Policy Analysis Are Often Inadequate for Problems of Global Change |journal=Climatic Change |volume=41 |issue=3-4 |pages=271–281 |date=19 March 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the assumptions stated by Simon are never fully valid in a real world context.

Further criticism of the rational model include: leaving a gap between planning and implementation, ignoring of the role of people, entrepreneurs, leadership, etc., the insufficiency of technical competence (i.e. ignoring the human factor), reflecting too mechanical an approach (i.e. the organic nature of organizations), requiring of multidimensional and complex models, generation of predictions which are often wrong (i.e. simple solutions may be overlooked), &amp; incurring of cost (i.e. costs of rational-comprehensive planning may outweigh the cost savings of the policy).

However, Thomas R. Dye, the president of the Lincoln Center for Public Service, states the rational model provides a good perspective since in modern society rationality plays a central role and everything that is rational tends to be prized. Thus, it does not seem strange that “we ought to be trying for rational decision-making”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dye, Thomas R. |title=Understanding Public Policy |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=12th |year=2007 |isbn=0-13-936948-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Incremental policy====
{{More|Incrementalism}}
An incremental policy model relies on features of incremental decision-making such as: satisfying, organizational drift, bounded rationality, and limited cognition, among others. Such policies are often called "muddling through" &amp; represent a conservative tendency: new policies are only slightly different from old policies. Policy-makers are too short on time, resources, and brains to make totally new policies; as such, past policies are accepted as having some legitimacy. When existing policies have sunk costs which discourage innovation, incrementalism is an easier approach than rationalism, and the policies are more politically expedient because they don't necessitate any radical redistribution of values. Such models necessarily struggle to improve the acceptability of public policy.

Criticisms of such a policy approach include: challenges to bargaining (i.e. not successful with limited resources), downplaying useful quantitative information, obscuring real relationships between political entities, an anti-intellectual approach to problems (i.e. the preclusion of imagination), and a bias towards conservatism (i.e. bias against far-reaching solutions).

===For workplaces===
There are many contemporary policies relevant to gender and workplace issues. Actors analyze contemporary gender-related employment issues ranging from parental leave and maternity programs, sexual harassment, and work/life balance to gender mainstreaming. It is by the juxtaposition of a variety of research methodologies focused on a common theme the richness of understanding is gained. This integrates what are usually separate bodies of evaluation on the role of gender in welfare state developments, employment transformations, workplace policies, and work experience.

====Group model====
This policy is formed as a result of forces and pressures from influential groups. Pressure groups are informally co-opted into the policy making process. Regulatory agencies are captured by those they are supposed to regulate. No one group is dominant all the time on all issues. The group is the bridge between the individual and the administration. The executive is thus pressured by interest groups.

The task of the system is to:
* Establish the rules of the game
* Arrange compromises and balance interests
* Enact compromises in policy
* Enforce these compromises.

====Other====
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
There are several other major types of policy analysis, broadly groupable into competing approaches:

*Empirical versus normative policy analyses
*Retrospective versus prospective analyses
*Prescriptive versus descriptive analyses.

===Techniques used in policy analysis===
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
*Cost–benefit analysis
*[[Management by objectives]] (MBO)
*Operations research
*Decision-making based on analytics
*[[Program evaluation and review technique]] (PERT)
*[[Critical path method]] (CPM).

==Evaluation==
The success of a policy can be measured by changes in the behavior of the target population and active support from various actors and institutions involved. A public policy is an authoritative communication prescribing an unambiguous course of action for specified individuals or groups in certain situations. There must be an authority or leader charged with the implementation and monitoring of the policy with a sound social theory underlying the program and the target group. Evaluations can help estimate what effects will be produced by program objectives/alternatives.  However, [[Correlation does not imply causation|claims of causality]] can only be made with [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized control trials]] in which the policy change is applied to one group and not applied to a control group and individuals are randomly assigned to these groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Social and Behavioral Sciences Team 2016 Annual Report|journal=Executive Office of the President National Science and Technology Council|date=2016|url=https://sbst.gov/download/2016%20SBST%20Annual%20Report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haynes|first1=Laura|title=Test, Learn, Adapt: Developing Public Policy with Randomized Controlled Trials|journal=United Kingdom Cabinet Office Behavioral Insights Team|date=2012|url=http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/201256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Randomized Control Trials to Evaluate Public Policy|url=https://innovation.govspace.gov.au/using-randomised-control-trials-evaluate-public-policy|publisher=Australian Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To obtain compliance of the actors involved, the government can resort to positive sanctions, such as favorable publicity, price supports, tax credits, grants-in-aid, direct services or benefits; declarations; rewards; voluntary standards; mediation; education; demonstration programs; training, contracts; subsidies; loans; general expenditures; informal procedures, bargaining; franchises; sole-source provider awards...etc.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle A. Saint-Germain, California State University&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steps for conducting a policy evaluation===
Policy evaluation is used to examine content, implementation or impact of the policy, which helps to understand the merit, worth and the utility of the policy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7504">The '''political science of religion''' (also referred to as politicology of religion or politology of religion) is one of the youngest disciplines in the [[political science]]s that deals with a study of influence that [[religion]] has on [[politics]] and vice versa with a focus on the relationship between the subjects ([[Actor (policy debate)|actors]]) in politics in the narrow sense: [[government]], [[political parties]], [[pressure group]]s, and [[religious communities]]. It was established in the last decades of the twentieth century.

==Research areas==
The basic research areas of the political science of religion are:
* All aspects of [[religion|religious]] teachings and practices that have direct political contents and messages, such as religious understanding of government, [[Power (sociology)|power]], political [[authority]], [[State (polity)|state]], political organizing, [[war]], [[peace]], etc.;
* All aspects of religious behavior and practice that don’t have direct political contents and messages but do have direct political consequences, such as building of [[Religious architecture|religious edifices]], [[pilgrimage]]s, etc.;
* Attitudes and positions of political subjects in the narrow sense towards religion and religious communities, such as that of [[political party|political parties]] and pressure groups towards religion and religious communities;
* Everything within apparently completely [[secular]] public behavior with no religious motives that causes religious consequences, such as an economic [[monopoly]] achieved by a religious group within a multi-confessional society – it cannot but cause political consequences.

These fields of research are in constant development. The newest area of research in political science of religion is on the subject of religion and international relations.

==History==
The political science of religion or politology of religion was established as an [[academic discipline]] in 1993 at the Faculty of Political Science of the [[University of Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/eng/pages/p_id1/o_p.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210043816/http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/eng/pages/p_id1/o_p.html |archivedate=2010-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The  founder of this discipline is Dr Miroljub Jevtic; http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/en/undergraduate-studies/political-department/third-year/ . In 2006, [[Georgetown University]] established the [[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] as one of the first American university research centers devoted to issues surrounding the political science of religion.

The ''Politics and Religion Journal'' was founded by the Center for Study of Religion and Religious Tolerance in [[Belgrade, Serbia]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politicsandreligionjournal.com/english/english.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028171212/http://www.politicsandreligionjournal.com/english/english.htm |archivedate=2008-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its ''spiritus movens'' and [[editor in chief]] is [[Miroljub Jevtić]], professor at the Faculty of Political Science, University of Belgrade, Serbia. The journal ''Politics and Religion'', produced by Cambridge Journals, published its first volume in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=RAP Politics and Religion]&lt;/ref&gt;

The political science of religion is studied at almost all universities and political science departments in the United States. The [[American Political Science Association]] has a religion and politics section.&lt;ref&gt;[https://connect.apsanet.org/s11/home/ “Religion and Politics”]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postgraduate research''' represents a formal area of study that is recognized by a university or institute of higher learning. By definition, the notion of “postgraduate” ([[United States]]) carries the implication that the candidate undertaking such research has already completed a formal [[Master's degree]] and at some instances the [[Doctor of Philosophy |PhD]], at an accredited university or tertiary institution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniguru.co.in/studyabroad/postgraduate/us-usa/all-university-courses/harvard-university-courses/72040/1/programs.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting qualifications arising from postgraduate research leads to Post ([[Doctorate]]s).&lt;ref&gt;http://cambridge.net/us/harvard-academics-courses-research/&lt;/ref&gt;
  
==Structure==
The structure of postgraduate research programs can vary significantly from one country to another.  To enter into a PhD program in the United States, students generally must have some form of prerequisite study beyond their basic graduate qualification. This may be a Master’s coursework program, which acts as a qualifier for entry.  In other countries, entry to Doctoral or Master’s research programs is based on the academic track record of the candidates in their undergraduate degrees.

Many students confuse the notion of postgraduate research with “invention” and “discovery”.  Postgraduate research ultimately represents an apprenticeship in the field of research.  In his textbook,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doctortee.net/KeyFactors.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''Key Factors in Postgraduate Research – A Guide for Students''. Dario Toncich explains that the objective of postgraduate research is not necessarily to make a breakthrough invention or, indeed, a major scientific discovery.  

It is, rather, a mechanism by which graduate students learn how to undertake a systematic investigation, founded upon the work built by peers in the field, and then to extend the current state of knowledge.  In the context of assessing a postgraduate research program, it is generally the systematic process of research and investigation that is given more attention than the level to which knowledge is extended.  The title "doctor" emanates from the Latin word ''docera''&amp;mdash;to teach.  Hence there is an expectation that the recipient of a doctorate would go on to become some form of "teacher" in the broad sense of the word.&lt;ref&gt;http://icmr.nic.in/ifc_research.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 19th century, postgraduate research was a rarity, with countries such as the United States only having a small number of candidates across their university spectrum.  However, by the start of the 21st century, postgraduate research, and postgraduate qualifications, had become commonplace.  In any one year, at a global level, there are hundreds of thousands of candidates undertaking postgraduate research programs.  For this reason the nature of postgraduate research has also changed.  

At Doctoral level, there is some recognition that it is no longer reasonable to expect major research breakthroughs as part of a postgraduate research program.  To this end, Doctoral research more commonly now represents an extension of knowledge, rather than some form of breakthrough.  There is also some recognition that modern postgraduate research programs now have to be conducted in the light of massive amounts of previously published work, and hence the [[literature review]] process has become significantly more complex.

The nomenclature associated with titles arising from postgraduate research vary from one institution to another and one country to another. Postgraduate research programs generally result in a thesis/dissertation, which is assessed by independent experts in the field.  The specific nature of the thesis varies from one discipline to another and from one country to another.  In addition, some universities insist that students also undertake a ''viva-voce'' oral examination in which they can defend their research and processes before an expert panel.

In [[India]], generally, the higher the level of the research degree the less association it has with a specific discipline.  For example, at Bachelor's level, it would be common to receive a [[Bachelor of Science |BS]]c(Chemistry).  At Master's level, the corresponding degree would be an MSc (without the specific subdiscipline).  At Doctoral level, the degree would be simply PhD with no discipline stated.  This is intended to show that the recipient of the award has mastered techniques that are more generic than those encapsulated in a specific discipline or subdiscipline.  There are some exceptions to this.  In a professional Doctorate, where the objective is to demonstrate an in-depth research knowledge of a particular area, the discipline is usually included (e.g., Doctor of Business).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isb.edu/fpm/ProgrammeStructure.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In some universities, it is also possible for candidates to achieve what is referred to as a "higher doctorate".  This is generally an award bestowed upon people who have made a substantial contribution to their discipline through their research.  Higher doctorates would normally be awarded after a significant research career and therefore those who receive such awards generally already have a basic PhD to begin with.  Like professional doctorates, higher doctorates generally carry the title of the discipline to which the research contributions have been made&amp;mdash;for example, Doctor of Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.be.seas.upenn.edu/prospective-students/doctoral/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Qatar Computing Research Institute''' (QCRI) in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], is a nonprofit multidisciplinary computing research institute founded by the [[Qatar Foundation]] (QF) for Education, Science and Community Development in 2010. It is primarily funded by the Qatar Foundation, a private, non-profit organization that is supporting Qatar on its journey from carbon economy to [[knowledge economy]]. 

==Background==
QCRI is one of the three national research institutes under Qatar Foundation and specializes in applied computing research. Its research fall into two main categories: core computing and multidisciplinary computing. Within core computing, QCRI specializes in internet computing (with an emphasis on cloud computing and social networking), data analysis, and advanced computer hardware design. Within multidisciplinary computing, QCRI is focused on Arabic language technologies, high performance computing, and bioinformatics.

QCRI has offices in the [[Hamad Bin Khalifa University|HBKU]] Research Complex, in [[Doha]]'s [[Education City]].  QCRI has a staff of 90+ employees.

==Origins==
QCRI grew out of a series of meetings held by the Qatari Arab Joint Committee (QAJC) analyzing the needs of Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;"Qatar Computing Research Institute looks to 'shake computer science'". Business Intelligence Middle East. 18 August 2010. http://www.bi-me.com/main.php?c=3&amp;cg=3&amp;t=1&amp;id=47875 Retrieved 8 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The group found that Qatar Foundation funded basic computing research at academic institutions worldwide through [[Qatar National Research Fund]] (QNRF) and that it incubated the development of new commercial computing products through Qatar Science and Technology Park (QSTP), but it lacked a research organization focused on computing grand challenges that address national priorities for growth and development.

QCRI was established in 2010 with a mandate to tackle large-scale computing challenges relevant to the needs of Qatari stakeholders.  The stakeholders include Qatari industry, Qatar’s government, and Qatari society.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;"Main Customers and Stakeholders". Qatar Computing Research Institute. 1 March 2011. https://www.qcri.org/about-qcri{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 8 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, QCRI’s customers include the petroleum industry, the telecommunications industry, the healthcare industry, and the media industry. The petroleum industry needs advanced computer modeling to assist in the extraction and movement of petroleum products. The telecommunications and datacenter industries need the most advanced research in computing networks, broadband, and other forms of advanced computing infrastructure. The healthcare industry needs efficient and secure management of electronic patient records, clinical information systems, and data interoperability protocols for the exchange and sharing of data. The media industry needs solutions for the cataloging and retrieval of vast amounts of content generated through audio and video, and it needs Arabic language technology solutions to digitize and publish the vast Arabic language corpora.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; QCRI also works closely with both the basic research institutes in Qatar, including the [[Education City]] Universities on their most promising basic research findings. It also will work closely with [[QSTP]] to identify the most viable commercial applications of QCRI’s research.

==Activities==
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2015}}
Research topics investigated by the QCRI include Arabic language computer technologies, [[computer security]] and [[data analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/about/articles/2014/QCRI_connection.html|title=Karem Sakallah Continues Commitment to Qatar Computing Research Institute|publisher=Computer Science and Engineering School, University of Michigan|date=3 February 2014|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic Language Technology Ecosystem Grand Challenge is to have an Arabic Language Technology research community in the Arab world of 100 specialized researchers, research engineers, and developers. The Arabic Machine Translation Grand Challenge hopes to realize machine translation for translating text or speech for 20 languages to and from Arabic. The Arabic Intelligent Support System Grand Challenge is a campaign to provide seamless multimodal Arabic content access and processing in 25% of newly authored software that handle Arabic in the Middle East. The Arabic Automated Language Tutor Grand Challenge assists in Arabic language learning for 1 million students via an interactive Arabic language tutor that teaches literacy, phonics, and grammar. The Seamless Arabic Dialogue System Grand Challenge is to transform 50% of automated commercial customer facing in Qatar to Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems. The Arabic Content and Search Grand Challenge will try to make Arabic a tier 1 language on the web and in the enterprise in terms content, search, and services.

== Sponsors and partners ==
QCRI's principal sponsor is the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development. QCRI conducts research and development in collaboration with various organizations, including [[Qatari Diar]], [[Aljazeera| Aljazeera Network]], Microsoft Research, and Yahoo! QCRI also collaborates with other computing research institutes, including [[MIT]], [[Columbia University]], [[University of Waterloo]], and [[Purdue University]].

==Directors==
The inaugural Executive Director of QCRI is [[Ahmed K. Elmagarmid]], who was appointed by the executive board of Qatar Foundation in 2010. Its managing director is Abdellatif Saoudi. The QCRI Executive Director is supported by an executive team consisting of the Managing Director, a Chief Scientist and the Research Directors within the institute consisting of Stephan Vogel, Sanjay Chawla, Ashraf Aboulnaga, Ting Yu and [[Ingmar Weber]].

'''Rehabilitation engineering''' is the systematic application of [[engineering|engineering sciences]] to design, develop, adapt, test, evaluate, apply, and distribute technological solutions to problems confronted by individuals with disabilities.  These individuals may have experienced a spinal cord injury, brain trauma, or any other debilitating injury or disease (such as Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's, West Nile, ALS, etc.). Functional areas addressed through rehabilitation engineering may include mobility, communications, hearing, vision, and cognition, and activities associated with employment, independent living, education, and integration into the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rehabengineer.homestead.com/ |title=RehabEngineer: Assistive Technology Resources for People with Disabilities |publisher=Rehabengineer.homestead.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Improving web access is also a field of interest.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} [[Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America]], the association and certifying organization of professionals within the field of Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology, defines the role of a Rehabilitation Engineer as well as the role of a Rehabilitation Technician, Assistive Technologist, and Rehabiltiation Technologist (not all the same) in the 2017 approved [http://www.resna.org/sites/default/files/legacy/Position-Papers/Rehabilitaiton%20Engineering%20Professionals%20-%20White%20Paper%20-%20RESNA%202017%20-%20Final%20-%20Approved.pdf White Paper] available online on their [http://www.resna.org/knowledge-center/position-papers-white-papers-and-provision-guides website].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The [[Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America]], whose mission is to "improve the potential of people with disabilities to achieve their goals through the use of technology", is one of the main professional societies for rehabilitation engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resna.org/ |title=RESNA Home Page |publisher=Resna.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supportive devices==

The rehabilitation process for [[people with disabilities]] often entails the design of assistive devices such as [[Walking aids]] intended to promote inclusion of their users into the mainstream of society, commerce, and recreation.

Within the [[National Health Service]] of the United Kingdom Rehabilitation Engineers are commonly involved with assessment and provision of wheelchairs and seating to promote good posture and independent mobility. This includes electrically powered wheelchairs, active user (lightweight) manual wheelchairs, and in more advanced clinics this may include assessments for specialist wheelchair control systems and/or bespoke seating solutions.

The [[Mind Controlled Wheelchair|A-SET Mind Controlled Wheelchair]] has been invented by [[Diwakar Vaish]], the head of Robotics and Research at A-SET Training and Research Institutes, India. It is of great importance to patients suffering from [[locked-in syndrome]], it uses neural signals to command the wheelchair. This is the world's first in production neurally controlled wheelchair.

==Ongoing research==

Rehabilitation Engineering Research Centers conduct research in the rehabilitation engineering, each focusing on one general area or aspect of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/programs/rerc/index.html |title=Rehabilitation Engineering Research Centers |publisher=Ed.gov |date=2012-06-13 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute]] conducts research for the [[blindness|blind]] and [[visual impairment|visually impaired]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ski.org/Rehab/index.html |title=The Smith-Kettlewell Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center |publisher=Ski.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017173332/http://www.ski.org/Rehab/index.html |archivedate=2014-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] Rehabilitation Research &amp; Development Centers conduct rehabilitation engineering research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vard.org/cent/centers.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=July 2012}}
In [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], '''reusability''' is the use of existing ''assets'' in some form within the [[Software development process|software product development process]]; these ''assets'' are products and by-products of the software development life cycle and include code, software components, test suites, designs and documentation. The opposite concept of ''reusability'' is '''leverage''', which modifies existing assets as needed to meet specific system requirements. Because reuse implies the creation of a {{clarify inline|text=separately maintained version of the assets|date=July 2015}}, it is preferred over leverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lombard Hill Group|title=What is Software Reuse|url=http://lombardhill.com/What_Reuse.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022010101/http://lombardhill.com/What_Reuse.htm|website=http://www.lombardhill.com|publisher=Lombard Hill Group|accessdate=22 October 2014|archivedate=2014-10-22|dead-url=yes|date=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Subroutine]]s or [[Function (programming)|function]]s are the simplest form of reuse. A chunk of code is regularly organized using [[Modular programming|modules]] or [[namespace]]s into [[Layer element|layer]]s. Proponents claim that [[Object (computer science)|object]]s and [[software component]]s offer a more advanced form of reusability, although it has been tough to objectively measure and define levels or scores of reusability.

The ability to reuse relies in an essential way on the ability to build larger things from smaller parts, and being able to identify [[commonality|commonalities]] among those parts. Reusability is often a required characteristic of [[platform (computing)|platform]] software. Reusability brings several aspects to [[software development]] that do not need to be considered when reusability is not required.

Reusability implies some explicit management of [[software build|build]], [[packaging]], [[distribution (business)|distribution]], [[installation (computer programs)|installation]], [[computer configuration|configuration]], [[Software deployment|deployment]], [[Software maintenance|maintenance]] and [[upgrade]] issues. If these issues are not considered, software may appear to be reusable from [[software design|design]] point of view, but will not be reused in practice.

Software reusability more specifically refers to design features of a software element (or collection of software elements) that enhance its suitability for reuse.

Many reuse design principles were developed at the WISR workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~ftp/wisr/SEN-pap/node1.html |title=Design for Reuse and Object Oriented Reuse Methods |publisher=Umcs.maine.edu |date=1995-01-20 |accessdate=2012-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970715093310/http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~ftp/wisr/SEN-pap/node1.html |archivedate=1997-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidate design features for software reuse include:
* [[Adaptability|Adaptable]]
* Brief: small size
* [[Consistency]]
* [[Correctness (computer science)|Correctness]]
* [[Extensibility]]
* [[Speed|Fast]]
* Flexible
* [[Generic programming|Generic]]
* Localization of volatile ([[Changeable design|changeable]]) design assumptions ([[David Parnas]])
* [[Modularity (programming)|Modularity]]
* [[Orthogonality]]
* [[Parameterization]]
* Simple: low [[Complexity (disambiguation)|complexity]]
* [[Stability Model|Stability]] under changing [[requirements]]

Consensus has not yet been reached on this list on the relative importance of the entries nor on the issues which make each one important for a particular class of applications.

'''Revision''' is the stage in the [[writing process]] where the [[author]] reviews, alters, and amends their message, according to what has been written in the [[Draft document|draft]]. Revision follows drafting and precedes [[editing]]. Drafting and revising often form a loop as a work moves back and forth between the two stages. It is not uncommon for professional writers to go through many drafts and revisions before successfully creating a written piece that is ready for the next stage: editing. Revision itself is not indicative of the quality of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Revision Cognitive and Instructional Processes: Cognitive and Instructional Processes|last=Allal|first=Linda|last2=Chanquoy|first2=L.|last3=Largy|first3=Pierre|publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC|year=2004|isbn=9789401037761|location=New York|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their seminal book, ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', [[William Strunk, Jr.]] and [[E.B. White]] acknowledge the need for revision in the writing process: “Few writers are so expert that they can produce what they are after on the first try. Quite often you will discover, on examining the completed work, that there are serious flaws in the arrangement of the material, calling for [[:wikt:transpose|transposition]]s... do not be afraid to experiment with your text.”

For an essay, a successful revision involves:

'''Identification of thesis'''. The purpose of the essay should be re-considered based on what has been written in the draft. If this purpose differs from the original [[thesis]], the author must decide from which thesis to continue writing.

'''Consideration of structure'''. The author should identify the strengths of the draft, then re-consider the order of those strengths, adjusting their placement as necessary so the work can build with [[Auxesis (figure of speech)|auxesis]] to a [[crescendo]].

'''Uncovering weakness in argument or presentation'''. Once the strengths of the draft have been identified and placed in the strongest order, the author can re-examine the work for weaknesses in argument or presentation. Faulty [[logic]], missing [[Transition words|transitions]], and unsupported  or poorly supported assertions are common weaknesses. Identifying these weaknesses during revision will inform the next draft.

In general, revision of written work can be guided by the following questions:

* Is the writing clear? Does it make sense?
* Is there enough information to describe ideas?
* Is there too much information so that the writing wanders off topic?
* Are the ideas or the narrative flow in a logical order?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beginning Writing Lab|last=Atlee|first=Nancy|publisher=Prufrock Press Inc.|year=1998|isbn=1883055296|location=San Luis, CA|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful revision is not improving [[grammar]] or [[diction]]. Those will be the focus of later editing. However, there are instances when the writer or the author employs a strategy that involves a reviewing process. There are scholarship and theories citing this particular theme such as the case of the three-component model identified by Hayes and Flower&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Effective Learning and Teaching of Writing: A Handbook of Writing in Education|last=Rijlaarsdam|first=|last2=Bergh|first2=Huub|last3=Couzijn|first3=Michel|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|year=2007|isbn=1402027249|location=New York|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the James Britton's model of the writing process as a series of stages described in metaphors of linear growth, conception - incubation - production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Landmark Essays on Writing Process|last=Perl|first=Sondra|publisher=Hermagoras Press|year=1994|isbn=1880393131|location=Davis, CA|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, a review by the writer or a third party, which often entails corrective annotations, is part of the process that leads to the revision stage. Recently, due to the collaborative capabilities offered by the [[Internet]], there are writers who "[[Crowdsourcing|crowdsource]]" reviews from several people, who contribute digital annotations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Roger Searle Payne''' (born January 29, 1935) is an [[United States|American]] [[biologist]] and [[environmentalist]] famous for the 1967 discovery (with Scott McVay) of [[whale song]] among [[humpback whales]]. Payne later became an important figure in the worldwide campaign to end [[whaling|commercial whaling]].

==History==
Payne was born in [[New York, New York]], and received his BA degree at [[Harvard University]] and his Ph.D. at [[Cornell]]. He spent the early years of his career studying [[animal echolocation#Bats|echolocation]] in [[bat]]s (and how their food, [[moth]]s, avoid them) and [[Sound localization|auditory localization]] in [[owls]]. Desiring to work with something more directly linked to conservation he later focused his research on [[whales]] where, together with researcher Scott McVay, in 1967 they discovered the complex sonic arrangements performed by the male humpback whales during the [[breeding season]].

Payne describes the whale songs as "exuberant, uninterrupted rivers of sound" with long repeated "themes", each song lasting up to 30 minutes and sung by an entire group of male humpbacks at once. The songs would be varied slightly between each breeding season, with a few new phrases added on and a few others dropped.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whaletrust.org/what-we-do/humpback-whale-research/whale-song/song-structure/&lt;/ref&gt;  Payne has led many expeditions on the world's oceans studying whales, their migrations, cultures and vocalizations.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;https://www.pbs.org/odyssey/odyssey/roger_payne.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Payne was also the first to suggest [[fin whale]]s and [[blue whale]]s can communicate with sound across whole oceans, a theory since confirmed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Some of Payne's recordings were released in 1970 as an [[LP album|LP]] called ''[[Songs of the Humpback Whale (album)|Songs of the Humpback Whale]]'' (still the best-selling nature sound record of all time&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;) which helped to gain momentum for the Save the Whales movement seeking to end [[commercial whaling]], which at the time was pushing many species dangerously close to [[extinction]]. Commercial whaling was finally banned by the [[International Whaling Commission]] in 1986.

In 1975 a second LP was released, and in 1987 Payne collaborated with musician [[Paul Winter]] putting whalesong to human music.

Whale recordings by Frank Watlington (with commentary by Roger Payne) were released on a [[Flexi disc]] soundsheet inside the January 1979 ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine. This issue, at 10.5 million copies, became the largest single press run of any record at the time.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/radiox/humpback/hw_archive.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723011927/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/radiox/humpback/hw_archive.html |archivedate=2015-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to whale recordings Payne has also published books and worked with film crews on many [[television]] [[documentary]] productions and on the [[IMAX]] [[movie]] ''Whales: An Unforgettable Journey''.

In 1971, Payne founded [[Ocean Alliance]], a [[501(c)3]] organization working with whale and ocean conservation. It is based in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]].  He still heads the organization.  He was also an [[assistant professor]] of [[biology]] at [[Rockefeller University]] and, concurrently, a research [[zoologist]] at the Institute for Research in Animal Behavior, run by [[Rockefeller University]] and the [[New York Zoological Society]].&lt;ref name=WhoWho&gt;"Roger Searle Payne."

From 1960-1985 Roger Payne was married to noted elephant researcher [[Katharine Payne]], who performed similar research on the vocalizations of elephants (and Humpbacks).&lt;ref&gt;http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/8903200609/rap-songs-from-deep&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural influence==
*Singer [[Judy Collins]] released her best-selling album ''[[Whales &amp; Nightingales]]'' in 1970, which featured some of Roger's whale recordings on the track "Farewell to Tarwathie."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richieunterberger.com/whales.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Also in 1970 composer [[Alan Hovhaness]] composed [[And God Created Great Whales]], the score for which calls for excerpts from Payne's recordings
*In 1977 Roger Payne's [[Whale vocalization|recordings of Humpback whales]] were included in the [[Voyager Golden Record]] carried aboard the [[Voyager program]] spacecraft, the first human artifacts to leave our [[Solar System]].
*Singer [[Kate Bush]]'s debut album ''[[The Kick Inside]]'' in 1978 features a portion of 'slowed-down solo whale' (from ''[[Songs of the Humpback Whale (album)|Songs of the Humpback Whale]]'') as an intro to the opening track "[[Moving (Kate Bush song)|Moving]]".
*[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]] (1986) features Payne's recordings, in a plot about rescuing Humpback whales from extinction by moving a breeding pair from 1986 to three hundred years in the future.
*In 2010, the band [[Glass Wave]] included Payne's whale recordings in the first track ("Balena") and last track ("Moby Dick") of their album.

== Works ==
*Producer, ''[[Songs of the Humpback Whale (album)|Songs of the Humpback Whale]]'', a 1970 LP (and later CD)
*Producer, ''Deep Voices'', a 1975 LP of more Humpback songs as well as [[Blue whale|blue]] and [[Fin whale]]s

The '''Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies''' ("SCJS"), founded in August 1990 by Rabbi Joshua Stampfer of [[Portland, Oregon]], and Dr. Stanley Hordes of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], is the major academic organization conducting and encouraging research on the [[Crypto-Jews]]{{ref|1}} of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] and their descendants today. This also involves significant attention being given to the [[Inquisition]] and to its ramifications for [[Sephardic Jews]] as well as for the general [[Jewish]] community. 

Membership in the SCJS is composed of scholars interested in crypto-Jews, descendants of crypto-Jews, and others interested in the topic from a historical, sociological, anthropological, religious, ethnic, literary, philosophical, or other perspective. The Society is nonreligious, and membership is open to all. Today, there is much interest, both academic and personal, in the history and contemporary status of crypto-Jews, and a number of distinguished scholars have published in the area. Especially in recent years, a number of people, especially, but not limited to, [[Hispanics]], have returned or converted to Judaism, frequently in part because of knowledge of a previously-suppressed Jewish heritage. [[New Mexico]], [[Texas]], [[Arizona]], and [[California]] are major areas of interest, but significant interest also is found in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], [[Orlando, Florida]], [[New York City]], [[Portland, Oregon]], and other areas with large numbers of [[Hispanic]]s. This contemporary phenomenon of returning/converting also is of specific interest to some academic researchers.

The SCJS publishes ''HaLapid'': The Journal of the Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies, a combination newsletter and journal. Published four times per year, ''HaLapid'' (Hebrew for The Torch) mostly includes refereed academic research articles, personal stories by descendants of crypto-Jews, and news items, but also includes occasional poetry, links for related websites, and other items of interest. The SCJC also hosts a website, and helps answer questions and make referrals for interested persons.

The Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies meets annually for a three-day conference which includes a keynote speaker, sessions on recent research findings, personal stories of returnees, business sessions, and various forms of entertainment. At the 2003 annual conference in San Antonio, Texas, the keynote speaker was retired Rabbi Samuel Lerer who spent much of his 51-year career working with anusim in Mexico. The SCJS has taken a lead in interest in [[DNA]] studies, especially as it applies to crypto-Jews, other Sephardim, and the Jewish community in general.

* Janet Liebman Jacobs, ''Hidden Heritage: The Legacy of the Crypto-Jews'' (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;13.
* {{note|1}} The well-known Judaica author [[Cecil Roth]] popularized the term [[marranos]] in his 1932 book ''A History of the Marranos'', but, because of the negative meaning attached to the word marrano by supporters of the Inquisition, today the term preferred by descendants and scholars is Crypto-Jews (i.e., Secret Jews), or [[anusim]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for forced ones)

'''Transilvania University of Brașov''' ({{lang-ro|Universitatea Transilvania din Brașov}}; '''UniTBv''') is a public institution of higher education in [[Brașov]], [[Romania]], founded in 1971. It has eighteen faculties, a total of over 19,000 students, and more than 700 academic staff. The University offers 105 days license areas, 12 areas for distance education, and 5 areas for higher reduced frequency, as well as 73 graduate programs and 18 doctoral programs.

==History==
University level education came to be and evolved through the city of Brașov's strong cultural tradition and climate. Early notable cultural nuclei include the [[First Romanian School]], the first printing press (introduced by Deacon Coresi), the [[Johannes Honterus]] High School, the activity centered on the newspaper '[[Gazeta de Transilvania]]' (founded by [[George Baritiu|George Barițiu]]), and many others.

The first higher education school in Brașov was founded in 1940 in the form of the 'Academy of Commercial and Industrial Studies', followed by the 'Institute of Forestry' and the 'Institute of Mechanics' in 1948 and 49 respectively. Following 1953, these merge into the 'Polytechnic Institute of Brașov', while 1960 sees the establishment of another institute, with departments of [[Mathematics]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]] and [[Biology]], followed by the founding of a department of Music in 1969.

In 1971 the 'University of Brașov' is founded by the merger of all higher education institutes through the [[Romanian Communist Party|Council of Ministers]]' Decision no. 1285/15 October. There were eight departments at the time: Faculty of [[Mechanical Engineering]], Faculty of Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of [[Forestry]], Faculty of Wood Industry, Faculty of Mathematics and [[Computer Science]], Faculty of [[Physics]]–[[Chemistry]], Faculty of Natural and [[Agricultural Science]] and the Faculty of Music.

Following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], the university changed its name to that of today, the '"Transilvania" University of Brașov'.

Since then, a number of other departments have been set up: [[Electrical Engineering]], [[Economics]] (both in 1990), [[Medicine]] (1991), [[Psychology]] &amp; [[Methodology]] (1995). In 1995, the Faculty of Manufacturing Engineering was split into the Faculty of Technologic Engineering and the Faculty of the Science and Engineering of Materials. Two colleges were also founded that year, that of Forestry and that of 'Economics and Computer Science'.

In 2001, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering expanded its array of specializations; thus it had its name changed to the 'Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science'.

In 2008 Transilvania University celebrated 60 years of existence, crowned with a spot at the top of the Romanian academic space.

Starting with the academic year 2005-2006, courses are organized to correspond with the [[Bologna Process]].

==Ranking==
According to the [[Scimago Lab]], based on data collected between 2007 and 2011, Transilvania University of Brașov ranked 1710 in the World, 113 regionally and 11 in the country by publication output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scimagoir.com/ Scimago Institutions Rankings]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of New Hampshire''' ('''UNH''') is a [[public research university]] in the [[University System of New Hampshire]], in the United States. The university's [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]] campus, comprising six colleges, is located in the [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|Seacoast region]] of the state. A seventh college, the [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]], occupies the university's campus in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], the state's largest city. The [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]], known as the [[Franklin Pierce Law Center]] until 2010, is located in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], the state's capital.

The University of New Hampshire was founded and incorporated in 1866, as a [[land grant college]]  in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]] in connection with [[Dartmouth College]]. In 1893, UNH moved to [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]].

With over 15,000 students between its Durham, Manchester, and Concord campuses, UNH is the largest university in the state. UNH is one of only a few universities that is designated a [[Land-grant university|land-]], [[Sea grant colleges|sea-]], and [[Space grant college|space-grant]] institution. The university's current President is [[James W. Dean Jr.]], the 20th President of the University, who took over from [[Mark Huddleston]] on June 30, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/news/release/2018/04/04/james-w-dean-jr-named-20th-president-university-new-hampshire|title=James W.

== History ==
[[File:Thompson Hall, UNH Sunset.jpg|thumb|[[Thompson Hall (University of New Hampshire)|Thompson Hall]], built in 1892, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]] 
[[File:Morrill Hall, UNH.jpg|thumb|right|Morrill Hall c. 1920]]
[[File:Durham NH 001.jpg|thumb|Pettee Hall c. 2005]]
The [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 granted federal lands to New Hampshire for the establishment of an agricultural-mechanical college. In 1866, the university was first incorporated as the '''[[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]]''' in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], in association with [[Dartmouth College]]. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth College and was directed by Dartmouth's president. Durham resident [[Benjamin Thompson (farmer)|Benjamin Thompson]] left his farm and assets to the state for the establishment of an agricultural college. On January 30, 1890, Benjamin Thompson died and his will became public. On March 5, 1891 Gov. Hiram Americus Tuttle signed an act accepting the conditions of Thompson's will. On April 10, 1891, Gov. Tuttle signed a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] authorizing the college's move to [[Durham, New Hampshire]].

In 1892, the Board of Trustees hired [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]] to draw a site plan for the first five campus buildings: Thompson, Conant, Nesmith, and Hewitt Shops (now called Halls) and the Dairy Barn. Eliot visited Durham and worked for three months to create a plan prior to the move to Durham. The Class of 1892, excited about the pending move to Durham, held commencement exercises in an unfinished barn on the Durham campus. On April 18, 1892, the Board of Trustees voted to "authorize the faculty to make all the arrangements for the packing and removal of college property at Hanover to Durham." The Class of 1893, followed the previous class and held commencement exercises in unfinished [[Thompson Hall (University of New Hampshire)|Thompson Hall]], the [[Romanesque Revival]] campus centerpiece designed by the prominent [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] architectural firm of [[Edward Dow (architect)|Dow &amp; Randlett]].

In fall 1893, classes officially began in Durham with 51 [[First year|freshmen]] and 13 upperclassmen, which was three times the projected enrollment. Graduate study was also established in fall 1893 for the first time. The number of students and the lack of state funds for dormitories caused a housing crunch and forced students to find housing in town. The lack of housing caused difficulty for attracting women to the university. In 1908, construction on Smith Hall, the first women's dorm, was completed using private and state funds. Prior to the construction of Fairchild Hall in 1915 for male students, 50 freshmen lived in the basement of DeMerritt Hall. With the continuing housing shortage for men, the administration encouraged the growth of the UNH [[Greek system]]. From the late 1910s through the 1930s, the fraternity system expanded and provided room and board for male students.

In 1923, Gov. Fred Herbert Brown signed a bill changing the name of the college to '''University of New Hampshire'''.

In the spring of 2015, the university was given $4 million from the estate of [[Robert Morin (librarian)|Robert Morin]], who had been a librarian at the university for almost 50 years. Having lived a frugal and secluded life, he allowed for his life's savings to be given to the university without restraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/news/release/2016/08/30/long-time-librarian-surprises-unh-4-million-gift|title=Long-Time Librarian Surprises UNH with $4 Million Gift|date=August 30, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the news that the university was spending $1 million on a new video screen for the football stadium provoked criticism, on and off-campus, with critics noting that the difference between that amount and the $100,000 the university transferred to the library was jarring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/15/494134464/-1-million-of-frugal-librarians-bequest-to-n-h-school-goes-to-football-scoreboar|title=$1 Million Of Frugal Librarian's Bequest To N.H.

If an out-of-state student's home state school does not offer a certain degree program offered by UNH, that student can receive the in-state tuition rate, plus 75 percent if enrolled in the program.

The Thompson School of [[Applied Science]] (TSAS), first established in 1895 and now a division of COLSA, confers an [[associate degree]] in applied science in seven different programs: Applied Animal Science, Applied Business Management, Civil Technology, Community Leadership, Food Service Management, Forest Technology, and Horticultural Technology.

The coastal proximity of the university affords excellent programs in [[marine biology]] and [[oceanography]]. Facilities include the Jackson Estuarine Laboratory at Adams Point in Durham, and the [[Shoals Marine Laboratory]] jointly operated with [[Cornell University]] on [[Appledore Island]] in the [[Isles of Shoals]].

The [[University of New Hampshire Observatory]] is operated by the Department of Physics for educational purposes.

There are three main university-wide undergraduate research programs: Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF), and International Research Opportunities Program (IROP).

The university offers many opportunities for students to study abroad through managed programs, exchange programs and approved programs. As of fall 2004, there were 561 students (4 percent of the student body) studying in 38 different countries.

== Presidential commissions ==

As with many other universities, the office of the President at UNH has tasked several commissions to gather facts and propose solutions to various issues on campus. Many of these commissions deal with social issues on campus, such as the status of People of Color, People with Disabilities, and LGBTQ. These various commissions are staffed by administrators, faculty, and community members. The commissions meet monthly and report to the President, providing updates on the campus environment, suggesting and improving programs, and working with students, faculty, and outside organizations to improve the quality of life on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unh.edu/inclusive/presidents-commissions/wc|title=Status of Women|date=2017-07-13|work=Community, Equity and Diversity|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326022216/https://www.unh.edu/inclusive/presidents-commissions/wc|archive-date=March 26, 2018|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underrepresented students==
===Diversity Support Coalition===

The student led Diversity Support Coalition (DSC) mission aims to offer resources to groups “affected by institutionalized oppression based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity and expression, age, ability, native language, national origin, and/or religion at UNH”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diversity Support Coalition|url=https://wildcatlink.unh.edu/organization/DSC|website=WildcatLink|access-date=April 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427044531/https://wildcatlink.unh.edu/organization/DSC|archive-date=April 27, 2018|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSC promotes, educates, and supports multiculturalism, diversity, and equality at UNH through programming efforts and support of the six student organizations within the DSC. The six member groups are Alliance, The Black Student Union, Hillel, Mosaico, The Native American Cultural Association, and The United Asian Coalition. Participation in the DSC is open to all UNH students. The DSC encourages student organizations with similar needs be recognized under the Diversity Support Coalition and may due so by submitting a petition within the guidelines for the DSC constitution. The total membership of the DSC is 200 individuals.

In addition to the six organizations within the DSC, UNH students run over a dozen groups for the purpose of multiculturalism and peer reference groups. Groups include women in professional fields, country or geographic specific cultural clubs, and international student clubs.

=== Women ===

Multiple organizations on campus are focused on providing women in professional fields access to relational and ideational resources promoting success. Women focused groups on campus include Her Campus, UNH Data Driven Women, Women in Business, Society of Woman Engineers, and Women in Science.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unh.edu/career/career-resources-women&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural clubs ===

Culturally focused groups on campus include Desi Student Association, Japanese Cultural Club, Indonesian Student Association, International Student Organization Middle Eastern Cultural Association, Russian Cultural Club and Vietnamese Student Association. These groups often host events to educate the student body on their cultures and to welcome experts of ancestral crafts. Conversely, the Committee on Rights and Justice (CORAJ) partners UNH student's with local immigrant families, helping them with the naturalization process.

=== International students ===

The University instituted the [[Navitas Group|Navitas program]] in 2011 to expand the amount of international students at the school. This expanded over the years into the Global Student Success Program (GSSP). The GSSP, in cooperation with the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), gives students the support to “help discover opportunities at UNH to immerse in American culture and share your own traditions with others from the U.S. and from around the globe”.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unh.edu/global/international-students&lt;/ref&gt; The programs guide students through the application process and the extent of their career.

During Fall 2015, UNH enrolled 298 Students from 34 different countries. The most common countries of origin are the People's Republic of China, Canada, and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Undergraduate Profile|url=https://admissions.unh.edu/sites/default/files/media/pdf/unh_2016_profile_with_2015-2016_tuition_3.pdf|website=University of New Hampshire Office of Admissions|publisher=University of New Hampshire|accessdate=1 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810024821/http://admissions.unh.edu/sites/default/files/media/pdf/unh_2016_profile_with_2015-2016_tuition_3.pdf|archive-date=August 10, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school also offers intensive English language education for students through the ESL Institute. As well as advancing student’s knowledge of English as a second-language one of the goals of the ESL Institute is to “to provide students with the cultural knowledge and awareness needed to function satisfactorily, both academically and socially, in the United States”.&lt;ref&gt;https://cola.unh.edu/esl-institute/mission-statement&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2015 year the university had almost 300 students representing the school from over 30 countries.

===First-generation college students===
Begun in 1994, UNH Connect is a program where FGCS (and multicultural students) are given a jump-start to the experiences of college life with a summer pre-orientation program aimed at social connection and comfortability with college life. Each student is assigned a peer mentor who helps with the transition to their freshman year. The program, with 100 students in 2014, also gives FGCS an opportunity to meet people in similar situations prior to the beginning of college.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unh.edu/orientation/connect/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center For Academic Resources (CFAR) also offers a program called TRIO that is partially funded by the US Department of Education. TRIO is intended for students who are FGCS, have a disability, or are in extreme financial need. Through the TRIO program you can receive services to help understand options for future careers as well as advice with financial aspects of college most FGCS would not have home support with. These include academic tutoring, assistance with student loans, scholarship advise, individual counseling, career planning, and many more. In the 2017-18 school year the UNH TRIO program was funded for 200 students.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unh.edu/cfar/triostudent-support-services&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The University of New Hampshire offers two undergraduate degree programs: the Bachelor of Arts in music and the Bachelor of Music; and two graduate degree programs: the Master of Arts in music (concentrations in composition, conducting, and musicology), and the Master of Arts in teaching.

==Athletics==
{{main|New Hampshire Wildcats}}
[[File:Whittemore Center, UNH 2.jpg|thumb|Whittemore Center]]
The school's athletic teams are the [[University of New Hampshire Wildcats|Wildcats]], and they compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]]. New Hampshire is a member of the [[America East Conference]] for [[basketball]], [[Cross country running|cross country]], [[track and field]], [[soccer]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] &amp; [[Diving (sport)|diving]] and [[tennis]]; and women's [[lacrosse]], [[crew]], [[field hockey]], and [[volleyball]]. The women's gymnastics&lt;ref&gt;[http://unhwildcats.com/index.aspx?path=wgym women's gymnastics]&lt;/ref&gt; program competes in the Eastern Atlantic Gymnastics League at the Division I level. They also compete in [[Hockey East]] in men's and women's [[ice hockey]], Eastern Collegiate Ski Association for skiing, as well as the [[Colonial Athletic Association]] for [[American football|football]] at the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS, formerly known as [[Division I-AA]]) level.

In the 2006 academic year the university cut women's crew, men's swimming &amp; diving, and men's and women's tennis at the varsity level, and trimmed the size of the men's ski team from 27 to 12. Luckily the UNH men's ski team was not cut, as they remain one of the top powerhouse teams in the nation. In 2013, the men's alpine team placed second  at the NCAA championships. The reason given was that the athletic department would save $500,000 towards a $1 million budget shortfall and be in compliance with [[Title IX]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhwildcats.com/pres0506/013106.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219141044/http://www.unhwildcats.com/pres0506/013106.shtml|date=February 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the university cut baseball, softball, men's and women's golf, and men's lacrosse.

In addition to varsity athletics, the university offers many club sports through the Department of Campus Recreation, including [[aikido]], [[archery]], [[baseball]], [[crew]], [[cycling]], [[dance]], [[fencing (sport)|fencing]], [[figure skating]], [[golf]], men's [[lacrosse]], [[Nordic skiing]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[sailing]], [[softball]], [[tennis]], [[taekwondo]], men and women's Ultimate Frisbee,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://thenewhampshire.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/ultimate-frisbee-sisters-of-oriza-a-look-inside-womens-ultimate| last1=Johnson| first1=Cameron| title=Ultimate Frisbee: Sisters of Oriza: A look inside women's Ultimate| work=[[The New Hampshire]]| date=November 7, 2014| accessdate=November 12, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012085115/https://thenewhampshire.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/ultimate-frisbee-sisters-of-oriza-a-look-inside-womens-ultimate/| archive-date=October 12, 2015| dead-url=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]], and the Woodsmen Club. Many of these clubs compete either on an intercollegiate basis with New England teams, or sponsor university tournaments and frequently participate in national championships. UNH also offers horseback riding as a recreation. Many students can take horseback riding lessons with instructors, on their horse or the schools. UNH holds many events each year, for they have a large cross country course. UNH also has a [[dressage]] team and a hunt seat team that competes yearly.

The school's official colors are [[blue]] and [[white]]. The school's official mascot is the [[Bobcat|wildcat]] and its uniformed mascot is known as "[[Wild E. Cat]]".

The recognized [[fight song]] of UNH is "[[On to Victory (song)|On to Victory]]", the most current version of which was arranged by Tom Keck, Director of Athletic Bands from 1998–2003. In 2003, "UNH Cheer" (originally titled "Cheer Boys") was resurrected from the university archives by Erika Svanoe, Director of Athletic Bands from 2003-2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.erikasvanoe.com/conducting.html| title=Professional Experience| publisher=ErikaSvanoe.com| accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the school song "Old New Hampshire", not to be confused with the [[Old New Hampshire|New Hampshire state song]] of the same name, "UNH Cheer" currently serves as a secondary fight song and is often performed immediately following "On to Victory".

On October 7, 2006, Wildcats [[wide receiver]] [[David Ball (wide receiver)|David Ball]] tallied the 51st receiving [[touchdown]] of his career to displace [[Jerry Rice]] of [[Mississippi Valley State University]], who was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] a month earlier, atop the ranking of NCAA Division I and I-AA players by career receiving touchdowns. He later signed as a [[rookie]] [[free agent]] with the [[Chicago Bears]] and played with well-known college football players [[Chris Leak]] and [[Darius Walker]].

==Durham campus==
[[File:CongreveAcrossTHall.JPG|thumb|left|Congreve Hall]]The University of New Hampshire is located in the town of [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]], and is a "traditional New England campus." The Durham campus is {{convert|1100|acre|km2}}, with {{convert|300|acre|km2}} in the "campus core" and {{convert|800|acre|km2}} of open land on the west edge of campus. The campus core is considered to be the university property within a 10-minute walk from Thompson Hall, the symbolic and near-geographic center of campus. The campus core contains many of the academic and residential buildings, while the outer campus contains much of the agriculture land and buildings. The university owns a total of {{convert|2600|acre|km2}} of land.

===Housing===
[[File:Smith Hall, UNH.jpg|thumb|right|Smith Hall c. 1915]]
[[File:Mills Hall.jpg|thumb|right|alt=alt text|Mills Hall - suites]]
[[File:Durham NH 011.jpg|thumb|left|Babcock Hall]]
The university offers all underclassmen the opportunity to live in university housing. As of 2006, the university housed 55% of all undergraduate students. While not required to live on campus freshman year, students are strongly encouraged to; as of the fall 2009 semester over 99% of incoming freshmen chose to live on campus, and over 70% of returning sophomores did as well.

The university offers students a choice of traditional dorm rooms, suites, and on-campus apartments. The university's Campus Master Plan envisions housing about 60% of undergraduates, requiring an addition of 1700 beds. However, the state of New Hampshire does not provide funding for non-academically related buildings, including dormitories.

Undergraduate housing is divided into three areas: The Hills, The Valley and The Timbers (formerly Area I, Area II and Area III, respectively). There are also two undergraduate apartment complexes, The Gables and Woodside Apartments. The university offers family housing in the Forest Park apartments and graduate housing in Babcock Hall. The second oldest dorm on campus is Hetzel Hall, named after the university's former president [[Ralph D. Hetzel]]. Built in 1925, it is located near downtown Durham.

For the fall 2006 semester, two new buildings at The Gables ("North" and "South") were opened, providing an additional 400 beds. In summer 2006, one-half of Forest Park was demolished to make way for two new buildings (A &amp; B) of the Southeast Residential Community (SERC). Buildings SERC A and SERC B have provided housing for 492 students since fall 2007. Two existing mini-dorms were demolished during summer 2007 (leaving four more mini-dorms) to construct a third building, SERC C, which has provided housing for 235 students since fall 2008. SERC A, B, and C are now referred to as Handler, Peterson, and Haaland Hall. Plans exist to provide 781 new beds by demolishing the remaining 9 buildings (98 units) in Forest Park. Later plans call for the construction of a new 170-unit graduate housing facility at a location to be determined.

Due to the over-enrollment of the 2006–2007 academic year, the university offered students who intended to live in campus housing a free parking pass for the academic year, credit in UNH "Dining Dollars" and a refund of the housing deposit given that the student withdrew their intentions to live on campus. The incentive was designed to free up space for the large incoming freshman class.

Stoke Hall is the largest residence building on campus. It houses a little over 700 undergraduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.unh.edu/housing/facility/stoke-hall| title=Stoke Hall| publisher=University of New Hampshire Housing &amp; Residential Life| accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, UNH installed life-saving [[automated external defibrillator]]s in two fraternity houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = UNH installs AEDs in fraternity houses| url = http://www.wmur.com/news/unh-installs-aeds-in-fraternity-houses/36336182| publisher = [[WMUR]]| accessdate = November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themed housing===
The University of New Hampshire offers themed housing options for students interested in choosing a living environment that best suits their personality. Common themes include: first year, leadership, green living, multi-cultural, honors, chem-free, alcohol and drug-free and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.residential-life.unh.edu/living/hallsandthemes.html |title=Living on Campus – Theme Living Communities |publisher=University of New Hampshire Housing &amp; Residential Life |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housing is guaranteed to all new first-year students, with many of them housed in Christensen Hall and [[Williamson Hall]], the two largest first-year-only halls. Alexander Hall is also an all first-year student hall, specifically for students in the College of Liberal Arts who have not declared a major yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Alexander Hall| url=http://www.unh.edu/housing/facility/alexander-hall| publisher=University of New Hampshire Housing &amp; Residential Life| accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These halls offer a living environment of commonality, where all are new to the university. The university guarantees students who live on-campus the ability to live on campus all four years. However, students who move off campus (with the exception of students studying abroad) lose this guarantee, and must complete a housing wait-list application each semester in order to be considered for on-campus housing the following semester.&lt;ref name=wait-list&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unh.edu/housing/process/waitlist.html |title=UNH Housing Waitlist Process |publisher=Unh.edu |date=February 29, 2012 |accessdate=July 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701173600/http://unh.edu/housing/process/waitlist.html |archive-date=July 1, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transfer students can generally get on campus housing if transferring to UNH for the spring semester (but must submit a completed housing wait-list application prior to transferring);&lt;ref name=wait-list/&gt; however, transfer students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://admissions.unh.edu/transfer|title=Transfer Students|date=2016-02-03|work=Undergraduate Admissions|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; transferring for the fall semester have a relatively low chance of getting on campus housing due to the high demand of returning students, and the incoming freshman class. Transfer students are also not guaranteed housing, unless transferring from a community college after graduating with their associates.&lt;ref name=wait-list/&gt;

==Manchester campus==
[[File:Manch-mills-westside.jpg|thumb|right|The north end of the Amoskeag Millyard, on the [[Merrimack River]]]]
[[File:Manch-DownTown.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown [[Manchester, NH|Manchester]], looking south along Elm Street]]
As of March 2015, [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]] is located in the {{convert|110000|sqft|adj=on}} Pandora Mill at 88 Commercial Street, on the banks of the [[Merrimack River]] in Manchester's historic [[Amoskeag Manufacturing Company|Amoskeag Millyard]]. The move to 88 Commercial Street increased the physical plant of the college by almost 50%, as from 2001 to 2014 the school was located in the {{convert|75000|sqft|adj=on}} University Center building at 400 Commercial Street.

==National Historic Chemical Landmark==
Conant Hall was dedicated as a [[ACS National Historical Chemical Landmarks|National Historical Chemical Landmark]]—the first in New Hampshire. Conant Hall was the first chemistry building on the Durham campus, and it was the headquarters of the [[American Chemical Society]] from 1907–1911, when Charles Parsons was the society’s secretary. In addition, from 1906–1928, the hall housed the laboratories of Charles James, who was an innovative developer of separation and analytical methods for compounds of rare earth elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=PP_ARTICLEMAIN&amp;node_id=925&amp;content_id=CTP_004295&amp;use_sec=true&amp;sec_url_var=region1&amp;__uuid=7645e5b7-59c9-4b73-afa0-fd8a2804bfeb  ACS National Historic Chemical Landmark], Separation of Rare Earth Elements (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; James Hall, the second chemistry building on campus, was named for Charles James.

'''Worst case analysis''' was, from 1978 until 1986, a doctrine under {{USC|40|1502.22}} which mandated that an [[environmental impact statement]] include such an analysis:&lt;ref&gt;19 [[Environmental Law Reporter|ELR]] 10026: [https://elr.info/sites/default/files/articles/19.10026.htm "Worst Case Analysis: The Final Chapter?"], by Vicki O'Meara Masterman&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|
When an agency is evaluating [[significant adverse effects]] on the human environment in an environmental impact statement and there are gaps in relevant information or scientific uncertainty, the agency shall always make clear that such information is lacking or that uncertainty exists.

(a) If the information relevant to [[adverse impacts]] is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives and is not known and the overall costs of obtaining it are not exorbitant, the agency shall include the information in the environmental impact statement.

(b) If (1) the information relevant to adverse impacts is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives and is not known and the overall costs of obtaining it are exorbitant or (2) the information is relevant to adverse impacts, is important to the decision and the means to obtain it are not known (e.g., the means for obtaining it are beyond the state of the art) the agency shall weigh the need for the action against the risk and severity of possible adverse impacts were the action to proceed in the face of uncertainty. If the agency proceeds, it shall include a '''worst case analysis''' and an indication of the probability or improbability of its occurrence.

'''Zoltán Gárdonyi''' (25 April 1906 – 27 June 1986) was a Hungarian [[composer]] and [[musicologist]]. He taught at the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]] for 26 years.

== Life and work ==
Gárdonyi was born in [[Budapest]]. His mother, the pianist Maria Weigl, studied at the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]] with [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s pupil, [[István Thomán]], at the same time and in the same class as [[Béla Bartók]]. At the age of 17, Gárdonyi began his studies in composition with [[Zoltán Kodály]] at the Liszt Academy in Budapest.{{r|bio}} After studying with [[Paul Hindemith]] and [[Arnold Schering]] in Berlin, he taught as a professor at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest from 1941 until 1967.{{r|bio}} He also led the faculty for Protestant sacred music until it was closed by the communists in 1949.{{r|augsburg}}

His oeuvre includes sacred music, orchestral works and chamber music.{{r|bio}} Three of his motets for choir [[a cappella]] were published in German by [[Schott Music|Schott]], "Finnisches Busslied", "Der Herr ist mein Hirte" ([[Psalm 23]]) and "Singet dem Herren" ([[Psalm 96]]).{{r|schott}} Gárdonyi's musicological research yielded findings related to [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]. His works were published in Germany, Sweden and the United States. Gárdonyi lived in Germany with his family beginning in 1972. He died in Westfalian [[Herford]] a few weeks after his 80th birthday.{{r|bio}}

His son is the composer and concert [[Organ (music)|organist]] [[Zsolt Gárdonyi]].

== Performances and recordings ==
Some of Gárdonyi's works were recorded, including his three organ sonatas and the ''Partita sopra Veni Creator Spiritus'', played by Dezső Karasszon, as well as several further organ works and German motets.{{r|Naxos}} The ''Partita'' is a symphonic organ composition, consisting of the following mouvements: introduction (Largo), theme (Lento), four variations and finale (Allegro maestoso), based on [[Martin Luther]]'s [[hymn]] for [[Pentecost]] "{{lang|de|[[Komm, Gott Schöpfer, Heiliger Geist]]}}".{{r|hannover}}

The '''École Nationale Supérieure de Chimie de Montpellier''', or '''ENSCM''', is one of the [[France|French]] ''[[Grandes Ecoles]]'', situated in [[Montpellier]]. Although it may share academic staff and research activities with the [[University]] as well as research bodies such as [[CNRS]], the ENSCM has a particular status as an independent body with its own research laboratories.

Teaching chemistry in Montpellier started in 1676 with the creation of the first chair of [[chemistry]] at the University of [[Medicine]]. Later on, in 1803 the School of [[Pharmacy]] was established with a chair of Chemistry and then the Faculty of Science in 1809. The original Institute of Chemistry was founded in 1889 in order to gather the professors who were teaching the same subjects in different Faculties. In 1934, it left the old historic centre to settle in larger and more functional new buildings.

The ENSCM is still in the same buildings - a few minutes' walk from the old historic city center - which were renovated and enlarged. It also acquired new facilities on a second site, 3 kilometers away from the main one, called "La Galéra", which is equipped with a kilo-lab and on a third site, close to Université Montpellier II : the "Institut Européen des Membranes".

The ENSCM provides high level training for engineers and researchers in Chemistry and is renowned for its research activities in the following fields:

* Macromolecular Chemistry (particularly Heterochemistry)
* Soft Chemistry
* Design and development of solids (macromolecules, hybrid materials, catalytic materials and membranes), study of the properties and uses of these materials.

Research is carried out ( in partnership with CNRS, Universités Monpellier I et II) in “Unités Mixtes de Recherche” (Mixed Research Units)
* UMR 5076 : Molecular and Macromolecular Heterochemistry
* UMR 5618 : Catalytic Materials and Catalysis in Organic Chemistry
* UMR 5635 : Institut Européen des Membranes.

Some ENSCM Professors and researchers are members of a team carrying out research in the field of Biology and Health. : UMR 5160 : Health Pharmacology and Biotechnologies Centre, CNRS, Université Montpellier II, Université Montpellier 1.

The ENSCM is also a member of the “Fédération Gay Lussac” – network of “Grandes Ecoles” gathering 17 Schools of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. Within this network, the ENSCM ranks very high both by the level of the student it recruits and the importance of the research activities carried out in its internationally renowned laboratories.
