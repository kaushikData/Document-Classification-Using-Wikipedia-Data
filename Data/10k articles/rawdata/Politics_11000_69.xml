The '''Conference of Communist and Workers Parties of Europe''' was an international meeting of [[communist party|communist parties]], held in the city of [[East Berlin]], capital of the communist-governed [[East Germany]], on 29–30 June 1976.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BKXsAAAAMAAJ Comparative communist foreign policy, 1965-1976]''. Rand Corporation, 1976. p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loeber, Dietrich André. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=69woVmAqZfgC&amp;pg=PA226 Ruling Communist Parties and Their Status Under Law]''. Dordrecht [u.a.]: Nijhoff, 1986. p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; In all, 29 parties from all [[Europe]] (except [[Albania]], [[Iceland]] and some [[European microstates|microstates]]) participated in the conference.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, Aurel. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=AzFpAAAAMAAJ Romanian Foreign Policy Since 1965: The Political and Military Limits of Autonomy]''. New York: Praeger, 1978. p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference highlighted several important changes in the European communist movement. It exhibited the declining influence of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and a widening gap between the independent and orthodox camps amongst European communist parties, with the ascent of a new political trend, [[Eurocommunism]].&lt;ref name="a"&gt;Sharma, Prem Mohan. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=C4sx5JYpR_IC&amp;pg=PA106 Politics of Peace and UN General Assembly]''. New Delhi: Abhinav Publications, 1977. p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="d"/&gt;

==Background==
Held in [[Moscow]], the [[1969 International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties]] was a debacle for its [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] hosts, as several parties (most notably the [[Workers Party of Korea]] and the [[Workers Party of Vietnam]]), had boycotted the event, whilst others had used the meeting as a platform to condemn the Soviet Union's [[Prague Spring|1968 military intervention in Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="i1"&gt;Shore, Cris. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BliKAAAAMAAJ Italian Communism: The Escape from Leninism : an Anthropological Perspective]''. London: Pluto Press, 1990. p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 1969 colloquium, proposals were put forward for another international conference, with the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] hoping to regain its lost prestige through such an event.&lt;ref name="i1"/&gt; However, many constituents of the world communist movement, primarily in Asia but also in Europe, were opposed to the holding of another international conference.&lt;ref name="l"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m1"&gt;Wishnick, Elizabeth. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pq0P8G4O8M8C&amp;pg=PA52 Mending Fences: The Evolution of Moscow's China Policy from Brezhnev to Yeltsin]''. Seattle [u.a.]: University of Washington Press, 2001. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than holding a meeting representing the global communist movement, by the mid-1970s, most of the main communist parties in Europe had expressed an interest in holding a specifically European conference instead.&lt;ref name="l"/&gt; During that decade, several political changes had occurred in Western Europe that various communist parties wanted to take advantage of; notably, Spain and Portugal had overseen the transition from right-wing military juntas to [[representative democracy|representative democracies]], while the parliamentary isolation faced by the French and Italian communist parties had come to an end.&lt;ref name="s2"&gt;Bracke, Maud. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hZYCNkngLe8C&amp;pg=PA347 Which Socialism, Whose Détente?: West European Communism and the Czechoslovak Crisis, 1968]''. Budapest: Central European University Press, 2007. p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, a new theoretical trend had emerged in several Western European communist parties that came to be known as [[Eurocommunism]]. Rejecting the domination of the Soviet Communist Party, it emphasized the development of theories and practices that were more applicable to Western Europe. The Soviet government disliked this Eurocommunist trend, and hoped that through holding a conference, they could achieve a document constituting a ''de facto'' charter of the European communist movement which would maintain their dominant role. Soviet discourse did at the time emphasize the importance of a united communist movement across the continent, denying differences between parties and labelling the distinction between Eastern and Western Europe as artificial.&lt;ref name="eu1"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=d2STAAAAIAAJ Eurocommunism between East and West]''. Bloomington: Indiana University press, 1980. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparations==
There was a prolonged process of preparation before the conference convened. Intense negotiations took place between October 1974 and June 1976, although accounts vary as to how many meetings actually took place, with claims ranging from 12 to 16.&lt;ref name="v"/&gt; The first preparatory meeting was held in [[Warsaw]], capital of [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="l"/&gt; Throughout the preparatory process, the Spanish, Italian, French, Romanian and Yugoslav parties pressed for recognition of the autonomy of each party, whilst the Czechoslovaks, Polish, Hungarians, Bulgarians and East Germans rallied to the defense of Soviet positions.&lt;ref name="v"&gt;Valdez, Jonathan C. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vXS9iL543D8C&amp;pg=PA71 Internationalism and the Ideology of Soviet Influence in Eastern Europe]''. Cambridge u.a: Cambridge University Press, 1993. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, James E., and Diane K. Pfaltzgraff. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OlQYAAAAIAAJ Eurocommunism and the Atlantic Alliance]''. Cambridge, Mass: Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis, 1977. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The disagreements during the preparatory process delayed the conference for a year.&lt;ref name="o1"/&gt;

At an early stage, an agreement was reached that any document approved by the conference would have to be adopted by consensus. Another agreement was that the agenda of the conference would be limited to themes relating to peace, security, disarmament and the struggle for social progress.&lt;ref name="l"/&gt; The last two editorial meetings for the drafting of the conference resolution were held in East Berlin on June 10–11 and June 24, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Leonhard, Wolfgang. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1NwEAQAAIAAJ Eurocommunism: Challenge for East and West]''. New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1978. p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the previous International Meetings of Communist and Workers Parties, the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] participated in the preparations and the conference (however, the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] did not participate).&lt;ref name="l"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bSJtQwAACAAJ Europas väg till socialismen]''. Stockholm: Arbetarkultur, 1980. pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Communist Party of Greece (Interior)]], a Eurocommunist splinter group, was barred from participating in the conference.&lt;ref&gt;Clogg, Richard. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kXm-cEJkvy4C&amp;pg=PA178 Parties and Elections in Greece: The Search for Legitimacy]''. Durham: Duke University Press, 1987. p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; The Icelandic [[People's Alliance (Iceland)|People's Alliance]] boycotted the conference.&lt;ref&gt;Tannahill, R. Neal. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=teYEAQAAIAAJ The Communist Parties of Western Europe: A Comparative Study]''. Westport: Greenwood Press, 1978. p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel to the conference preparations, the [[Italian Communist Party]] organized two bilateral events with its two main Eurocommunist counterparts; a meeting with the [[Communist Party of Spain]] in [[Livorno]] in July 1975 and a summit with the [[French Communist Party]] in Rome in the summer 1976.&lt;ref name="r26"&gt;Dunphy, Richard. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ILv-HBTlf8C&amp;pg=PA26 Contesting Capitalism?: Left Parties and European Integration]''. Manchester [u.a.]: Manchester University Press, 2004. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The Eurocommunists were not a solid bloc, and sharp differences between the parties were manifested during the preparatory process. The French party, whilst criticizing the lack of civil liberties in the Soviet Union, was hesitant to give up [[proletarian internationalism]] for the concept of international solidarity proposed by the Italians.&lt;ref name="ma1"&gt;Machin, Howard. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6-8NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA95 National communism in Western Europe]''. London: Methuen, 1983. p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Differences on how to analyze the situation in Portugal following the [[Carnation Revolution]] divided the French and Italian parties. The French voiced their support for the strategy of the Portuguese Communist Party whilst the Italians publicly criticized the Portuguese party.&lt;ref name="s1"&gt;Bracke, Maud. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hZYCNkngLe8C&amp;pg=PA347 Which Socialism, Whose Détente?: West European Communism and the Czechoslovak Crisis, 1968]''. Budapest: Central European University Press, 2007. p. 347&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates and document==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R0629-0114, Berlin, Alexanderplatz, Hotel "Stadt Berlin".jpg|thumb|300px|The venue of the conference, the [[Park Inn Berlin|Interhotel Stadt Berlin]]]]Albeit without direct polemical exchanges, the speeches made at the conference showed diversity between positions the communist parties present.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bg"/&gt; In their speeches, [[Santiago Carrillo]], [[Enrico Berlinguer]] and [[George Marchais]] decried aspects of the Soviet political system.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; Berlinguer stated that West European communists favoured a democratic state, political pluralism, freedom of expression, free [[trade unions]] and religious freedoms.&lt;ref name="o1"&gt;Ouimet, Matthew J. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aFSwrUcuDWsC&amp;pg=PA85 The Rise and Fall of the Brezhnev Doctrine in Soviet Foreign Policy]''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003. pp. 85-87&lt;/ref&gt; In his address to the assembled delegates, the Yugoslav leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] stated that "[c]ommunists must accept different roads in the struggle for socialism, independence, equality and non-interference in internal affairs".&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; The Romanian leader [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] also voiced support for principles of independence of individual parties and non-interference.&lt;ref name="v75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="w1"&gt;Leonhard, Wolfgang. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1NwEAQAAIAAJ Eurocommunism: Challenge for East and West]''. New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1978. pp. 146-147&lt;/ref&gt; Other participants that argued for the Eurocommunist cause at the conference were [[Lars Werner]] from Sweden, [[Gordon McLennan (politician)|Gordon McLennan]] from Britain, [[Ermenegildo Gasperoni]] from San Marino and, to a lesser extent, the Finnish Communist Party chief [[Aarne Saarinen]].&lt;ref name="w1"/&gt;

On the other hand, there were also interventions from other delegates whom re-affirmed their adherence to the line of the Soviet party.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; The Bulgarian communist leader [[Todor Zhivkov]], in his intervention, took a firmer stand than the Soviets in upholding the notion of general laws of socialist development (as opposed to the idea that each party should develop its own way of building socialism), denouncing [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]] and underlining the dual responsibility of the individual communist party (both to its own people and the world communist movement).&lt;ref name="v75"/&gt; [[Gustáv Husák]] of Czechoslovakia and the East German host, [[Erich Honecker]], were also amongst the prominent spokespersons of the orthodox camp. Other parties that voiced their support for the Soviets, in varying degrees, were the Greek, Portuguese, West German, Luxembourgish, Danish, West Berlin, Turkish, Norwegian and Austrian parties.&lt;ref name="w1"/&gt;

[[File:Positions of European Communist Parties at the 1976 Berlin Conference.png|thumb|left|300px|Positions of the European communist parties at the 1976 Berlin Conference:&lt;br /&gt;Red = Orthodox or Pro-Soviet camp&lt;br /&gt;Green = Eurocommunist or Independent camp&lt;br /&gt;Blue = Neutral group&lt;br /&gt;Grey = Boycott]]

The Soviet party leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] adopted a more conciliatory tone than his orthodox colleagues. He urged the conference to reaffirmation its commitment to [[proletarian internationalism]], but without references to dual responsibility and mutual assistance (which had been cornerstones of Soviet discourse on the subject).&lt;ref name="v75"&gt;Valdez, Jonathan C. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vXS9iL543D8C&amp;pg=PA75 Internationalism and the Ideology of Soviet Influence in Eastern Europe]''. Cambridge u.a: Cambridge University Press, 1993. pp. 75-77&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Gierek]] of Poland and [[János Kádár]] of Hungary also placed themselves within the orthodox camp in their speeches to the conference, but kept a lower profile and expressed certain individual nuances.&lt;ref name="w1"/&gt;

Apart from the main antagonists at the Berlin meeting, there was also a grouping of parties that were reluctant to choose either the Eurocommunist or the orthodox side. This grouping included the Cypriot, Belgian, Dutch, Irish and Swiss delegates.&lt;ref name="w1"/&gt;

The final document of the conference was titled "For Peace, Security, Cooperation and Social Progress in Europe".&lt;ref name="f1"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=UqrS4U6VfYEC&amp;pg=PA9 The Language of Foreign Affairs]''. Department of State Library, 1978. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The document contained several novelties compared to previous practices in the world communist movement.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; One of the most prominent features of the document was the recognition of the principle of "equality and independence of all communist parties and their right to decide their own policies without external interference".&lt;ref name="f1"/&gt; The Soviet party had thus, at least in theory, conceded to the Eurocommunist demands for the principle of non-interference in the affairs of other parties.&lt;ref name="r26"/&gt; The document carried no mention of [[Marxism-Leninism]], instead there was a reference to the 'great ideas' of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[V. I. Lenin]].&lt;ref name="bg"/&gt; References to 'proletarian internationalism' were substituted with the term 'international solidarity'. Moreover, the document stated that fraternal criticism between communist parties would not constitute anti-communism (implying that criticism of Soviet policies would not be considered as 'anti-Sovietism', as the official Soviet discourse had argued).&lt;ref name="b"&gt;Urban, Joan Barth. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8HDEhJQON1AC&amp;pg=PA275 Moscow and the Italian Communist Party: From Togliatti to Berlinguer]''. London: Tauris, 1986. p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; The document was not approved through signature or a vote, it was simply issued, a fact later criticized by the Yugoslavs.&lt;ref name="v75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="f1"/&gt;

The conference also endorsed the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki process]] and [[International human rights instruments|international human rights covenants]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Daniel Charles. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=UPym2WAzDuEC&amp;pg=PA182 The Helsinki Effect: International Norms, Human Rights, and the Demise of Communism]''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001. p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the declaration of the 1969 meeting, the Berlin conference document did not contain any condemnation of China.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt; The Soviets had pushed for a condemnation of China ahead of the conference, but the Yugoslavs, the French and the Italians resisted these moves.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, George. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QpRVV071D0wC&amp;pg=PA251 Workers and Communists in France: From Popular Front to Eurocommunism]''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1982. p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kapur, Harish. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wmDEYFCU03QC&amp;pg=PA210 The End of Isolation: China After Mao]''. Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff, 1985. p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Berlin conference, the French Communist Party rejected the possibility of holding future conferences on the same lines.&lt;ref name="ma1"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The verbatim of the speeches at the conference were presented in full in ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'', the central organ of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, whilst the more critical aspects were censored out in the reports in the Soviet newspaper ''[[Pravda]]''.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; In particular the speech of Carrillo was very difficult for the Soviets to digest.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In his speech to the conference, Carrillo stated that "The past and present sufferings of our parties and the time spent in the catacombs have created among our rank and file an alloy made out of scientific socialism and a kind of mysticism based on sacrifice and a sense of predestination. We have built a new kind of church with our own martyrs and prophets. Moscow, where our dreams first began to come true, was for a long time a kind of Rome for us. We spoke of the Great October Socialist Revolution as if it were our Christmas. This was the period of our infancy. Today we have grown up." See East, Roger. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IHsEAQAAIAAJ Communist and Marxist Parties of the World]'' (Harlow, Essex: Longman [u.a.], 1990. p. 559).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pravda'' sought to portray the conference as a victory for proletarian internationalism and communist unity, downplaying the divisions that had appeared at the meeting.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; Other Socialist Bloc newspapers also censored the speeches from the conference.&lt;ref name="w1"/&gt;

Following the Berlin conference the Eurocommunists would step up their critiques of Soviet policies further.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="u2"/&gt; They began to foster relations with dissidents inside the Socialist Bloc and, occasionally, defended them against state repression.&lt;ref name="o1"/&gt;

Soviet party at times responded in kind to Eurocommunist critiques through veiled ideological counter-accusations.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bg"&gt;Boggs, Carl, and David Plotke. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YLpeehsfuMwC&amp;pg=PA33 The Politics of Eurocommunism: Eclipse of the Bolshevik Legacy in the West]''. Montreal: Black Rose Books, 1980. pp. 33, 313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="u2"&gt;Urban, Joan Barth. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8HDEhJQON1AC&amp;pg=PA283 Moscow and the Italian Communist Party: From Togliatti to Berlinguer]''. London: Tauris, 1986. p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; A notable counter-attack by the orthodox camp was an article by Zhivkov in ''[[Problems of Peace and Socialism]]'' in December 1976, which decried Eurocommunism as an anti-Soviet 'subversion against proletarian internationalism'.&lt;ref name="d"&gt;Garthoff, Raymond L. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGG-x_tuNUcC&amp;pg=PA546 Détente and Confrontation: American-Soviet Relations from Nixon to Reagan]''. Washington, D.C.: Brookings Inst, 1994. p. 546&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yugoslav party on its side claimed that the Soviets had corrupted the conference documentation, that the Soviets had tried to portray a greater degree of unity between the parties than what had actually been the case at the conference.&lt;ref name="v75"/&gt;

In April 1980 a new European conference was held in [[Paris]], but under different terms. The principle of consensus was gone at the Paris conference, and the Italian, Romanian, Spanish, Yugoslav, Icelandic, British, Dutch and Sammarinese communist parties boycotted the event.&lt;ref name="ma4"&gt;Machin, Howard. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6-8NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA36 National communism in Western Europe]''. London: Methuen, 1983. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urban, Joan Barth. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8HDEhJQON1AC&amp;pg=PA311 Moscow and the Italian Communist Party: From Togliatti to Berlinguer]''. London: Tauris, 1986. p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; The French Communist Party, co-sponsors of the meeting together with the Polish United Workers Party, rejected the notion that the Paris meeting would have been of a similar kind as the Berlin conference as no common positions on strategy had been approved.&lt;ref name="ma2"&gt;Machin, Howard. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6-8NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA104 National communism in Western Europe]''. London: Methuen, 1983. p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

The percentage of party members in comparison with the total population is calculated on the basis of Carlberg's numbers and population figures as per 1976 encountered in the 1978 ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=S2W9jZcp6M0C&amp;pg=PA21 World Development report]'' (World Bank, 1978. pp. 21, 28), the ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=M9QYndAPmuQC&amp;pg=PA555 Regional Survey of the World: Western Europe 2003]'' (London: Europa Publications, 2002. p. 555, in the case of San Marino), ''[http://www.nisra.gov.uk/archive/demography/population/midyear/NI_Home_Pop_sya(1961-%202010).xls Home Population by sex &amp; single year of age 1961-2010]'' (Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, used for Northern Ireland) and ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8AvsAAAAMAAJ Wochenbericht, Vol. 64]'' (Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung, 1997. p. 765, used for West Berlin). Thus neither the presented membership figures nor calculated percentages of populations are exact, but the presentation does provide an overview of the relative strengths of the different parties during this period.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[vote of no confidence]] in the Spanish [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] [[Rajoy government#Second Rajoy government (2016–present)|Government]] of [[Mariano Rajoy]] was announced on 27 April 2017 and held on 13–14 June. The motion of no confidence was formally registered on 19 May by [[Unidos Podemos]] after a massive corruption case involving high-ranking PP officials unveiled maneuvers from the Rajoy government to influence the [[judicial system]] in order to cover-up the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Torres |first=Diego |date=18 May 2017 |title=Spain’s never-ending corruption problem |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/spain-corruption-pp-rajoy-never-ending-problem-graft-ignacio-gonzalez/ |work=Politico |location=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |access-date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Riveiro |first=Aitor |date=19 May 2017 |title=Irene Montero: "Las fuerzas que voten 'no' a la moción de censura estarán sosteniendo al Gobierno" |url=http://www.eldiario.es/politica/Irene-Montero-censura-sosteniendo-Gobierno_0_645335722.html |language=Spanish |work=eldiario.es |location=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |access-date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the third vote of no confidence held in Spain since the country's [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition to democracy]], after the unsuccessful 1980 and 1987 no confidence votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rodríguez Arroyo |first=Jorge |date=27 April 2017 |title=La moción de censura de Podemos, la tercera de la democracia |url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2017/04/27/actualidad/1493288931_051672.html |language=Spanish |work=El País |location=Madrid |access-date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Votes of no confidence in Spain are [[Constructive vote of no confidence|constructive]], meaning that confidence from a [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] may only be withdrawn if a positive majority for a prospective successor exists.

The motion was defeated on 14 June 2017, gathering the support of Unidos Podemos, [[Coalició Compromís|Compromís]], [[Republican Left of Catalonia|ERC]] and [[EH Bildu]] (for a total of 82 favourable votes), the opposition of PP, Ciudadanos, [[Navarrese People's Union|UPN]], [[Canarian Coalition|CCa]] and [[Asturias Forum|FAC]] (170 votes against) and the abstentions of PSOE, [[Catalan European Democratic Party|PDeCAT]], PNV and [[New Canaries|NCa]] (97).&lt;ref name="MotionResult"/&gt;

This was the first motion of no confidence to be registered in Spain by a parliamentary group different than one of the two largest ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rodríguez-Pina |first=Gloria |date=27 April 2017 |title=Qué es una moción de censura y por qué no prosperará la de Podemos |url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2017/04/27/actualidad/1493288856_961028.html |language=Spanish |work=El País |location=Madrid |access-date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:(Mariano Rajoy) Copa de Navidad PP Madrid (39257644232) (cropped).jpg|175px|thumb|upright|The motion of no confidence was tabled after a massive string of scandals shook [[Mariano Rajoy]]'s [[People's Party (Spain)|party]] and [[Second Rajoy Government|government]].]]
The [[Second Rajoy Government]] was sworn into office on 31 October 2016, after a [[2015–16 Spanish government formation|ten-month political deadlock and two general elections]] and the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]]'s (PSOE) decision not to block [[Mariano Rajoy]]'s investiture bid. However, the resulting government was a [[Minority government|minority]] one, and throughout the ensuing months it struggled to get its bills passed into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=16 March 2017 |title=El Congreso tumba por primera vez un decreto ley del PP al derribar la reforma de la estiba |url=http://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-congreso-tumba-primera-vez-decreto-ley-pp-derribar-reforma-estiba-20170316131658.html |language=Spanish |work=Europa Press |location=Madrid |access-date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the ruling [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) came under increasing political pressure after a political scandal in [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] forced [[President of the Region of Murcia|regional President]] [[Pedro Antonio Sánchez]] to resign, having been accused of several corruption crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=García |first=Luis |date=4 April 2017 |title=Dimite el presidente de Murcia Pedro Antonio Sánchez |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20170404/421442385580/pedro-antonio-sanchez-presidente-de-murcia-dimision.html |language=Spanish |work=La Vanguardia |location=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, after only five months into its term, the PP was shaken by a succession of events that smashed attempts to relaunch the party's image. Just as Prime Minister Rajoy was called to testify as witness at the [[Gürtel case|Gürtel graft trial]], a new, massive case of alleged corruption was unveiled (dubbed as "Lezo"), joining the already ongoing investigations into the Púnica and Gürtel scandals. Operation Lezo resulted in the arrest of former [[President of the Community of Madrid]] [[Ignacio González González|Ignacio González]], who was accused of diverting millions of euros from the public treasury into tax havens and to pay off his party's debts during his tenure as regional premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Casqueiro |first=Javier |date=20 April 2017 |title=Spanish PM Rajoy on the ropes as corruption scandals hit ruling party |url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2017/04/20/inenglish/1492671101_227503.html |work=El País |location=Madrid |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Recuero |first=Marisa |date=21 April 2017 |title=La trama de González desvió 23,3 millones de "dinero madrileño" a cuentas en paraísos fiscales |url=http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2017/04/21/58f9fa8de5fdea26658b463a.html |language=Spanish |work=El Mundo |location=Madrid |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Urreiztieta |first=Esteban |date=22 April 2017 |title=Ignacio González "saneó" el PP con dinero público coincidiendo con su llegada a la Presidencia en Madrid |url=http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2017/04/22/58fb621ce5fdea8a028b458c.html |language=Spanish |work=El Mundo |location=Madrid |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of the new scandal reached heights never seen in Spanish politics before.

The leaking of a series of recordings that involved González and various high-ranking PP and government officials—including former [[President of the Valencian Government]] [[Eduardo Zaplana]] and [[Ministry of Justice (Spain)|Justice Minister]] [[Rafael Catalá]]—unveiled a plot from the [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Interior]] and Justice ministries [[Obstruction of justice|to cover-up the scandal]], seriously putting [[judicial independence]] in Spain into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Águeda |first=Pedro |date=25 April 2017 |title=Las grabaciones a Ignacio González evidencian las maniobras del PP para quitar y poner jueces y fiscales |url=http://www.eldiario.es/politica/Ignacio-Gonzalez-evidencian-maniobras-PP_0_636937525.html |language=Spanish |work=eldiario.es |location=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Npt stated--&gt; |date=25 April 2017 |title=El SMS de Rafael Catalá a Ignacio González en 2016: "Ojalá se cierren pronto los líos" |url=http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2017/04/25/58ff2a07e5fdea34438b4615.html |language=Spanish |work=El Mundo |location=Madrid |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hernández |first=Marisol |date=25 April 2017 |title=El ministro del Interior revela que Ignacio González le telefoneó y le pidió tomarse un café |url=http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2017/04/25/58ff87d0ca47413d3d8b4630.html |language=Spanish |work=El Mundo |location=Madrid |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the leaked recordings, González pointed to a tape that would allegedly show Rajoy receiving bribes from a businessman, and that this would have been used by [[Intereconomía TV|Intereconomía]] CEO [[Julio Ariza]] in the past to blackmail him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=12 May 2017 |title=Rajoy habría sufrido un chantaje: así lo revelan las conversaciones entre Ignacio González y Zaplana del caso Lezo |url=http://www.lasexta.com/noticias/nacional/rajoy-habria-sufrido-un-chantaje-asi-lo-revelan-las-conversaciones-entre-ignacio-gonzalez-y-zaplana-del-caso-lezo_20170512591581940cf2a1da482d1494.html |language=Spanish |work=laSexta |location=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, the anti-corruption chief prosecutor, Manuel Moix—revealed by police wiretaps to have been favoured for the job by Ignacio González before his appointment in February 2017—was accused of trying to stop investigations into the PP graft accusations.&lt;ref name="censure2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Jones |first=Sam |date=1 May 2017 |title=Podemos to table no-confidence vote against Mariano Rajoy amid corruption scandal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/01/podemos-press-no-confidence-vote-mariano-rajoy-spain |work=The Guardian |location=Madrid |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Keeley |first=Graham |date=2 May 2017 |title=Anti-corruption chief got top job after fraud suspect put in a good word |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/anti-corruption-chief-got-top-job-after-fraud-suspect-put-in-a-good-word-7v6f5wjvd |work=The Times |location=Madrid |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; José Antonio Nieto, Secretary of State for Security—[[Juan Ignacio Zoido]]'s deputy in the Interior Ministry—came under pressure after he was accused of revealing details of the ongoing investigations to González's brother in a private meeting held on 8 March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vázquez |first=Ángeles |date=22 April 2017 |title=El hermano de Ignacio González se reunió con el número dos de Interior tras saberse investigado |url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/politica/hermano-ignacio-gonzalez-reunion-numero-dos-interior-investigacion-5989895 |language=Spanish |work=El Periódico de Catalunya |location=Madrid |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vázquez |first=Ángeles |date=9 May 2017 |title=La fiscalía sospecha de Interior en el chivatazo a Ignacio González |url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/politica/anticorrupcion-apunta-chivada-secretario-estado-seguridad-expresidente-madrileno-6026264 |language=Spanish |work=El Periódico de Catalunya |location=Madrid |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-May, the string of scandals had splattered [[Cristina Cifuentes]], incumbent President of Madrid, who was accused by the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] of having been involved in the contract awarding procedures that led to her party's illegal financing between 2007 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Águeda |first=Pedro |last2=Pinheiro |first2=Marcos |last3=Precedo |first3=José |date=16 May 2017 |title=La Guardia Civil implica a Cifuentes en la financiación irregular del PP de Madrid |url=http://www.eldiario.es/politica/Guardia-Civil-Cifuentes-PP-Madrid_0_644286065.html |language=Spanish |work=eldiario.es |location=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, it was also concluded that Esperanza Aguirre had won the [[Madrilenian regional election, 2007|2007]] and [[Madrilenian regional election, 2011|2011]] regional elections unfairly, with her campaign budgets well above those legally declared, through a system that "hurted political pluralism".

As a result of the scandals, and Rajoy's refusal to take any action despite opposition calls, [[Unidos Podemos]] members—comprising [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]], [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]], [[En Comú Podem]] and [[En Marea]]—announced that they would table a motion of no confidence and would request support from PSOE and other parties.&lt;ref name="censure1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="censure2"/&gt; The rivalries between the opposition parties, however, meant that the initiative was unlikely to succeed: PSOE rejected to support the motion and accused Podemos leader [[Pablo Iglesias Turrión|Pablo Iglesias]] of "bad faith" and of interfering within the party's ongoing [[39th PSOE Federal Congress|leadership primary election]], whereas [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Ciudadanos]]—on which the Rajoy government relied for [[confidence and supply]] support—labeled the move as "circus". The [[Basque Nationalist Party]] also voiced its opposition to the maneuver.&lt;ref name="oppositiontocensure"/&gt; Nonetheless, the Socialists were put in a difficult situation, as opposing the motion would see them rallying behind Rajoy's government amid the ongoing scandals and at a time when they were still without a leader, after the [[2016 PSOE crisis|party crisis]] that led to [[Pedro Sánchez (Spanish politician)|Pedro Sánchez]]'s resignation and Rajoy's investiture in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Buck |first=Tobias |date=27 April 2017 |title=Spain’s far-left opposition calls no-confidence vote in PM Rajoy |url=https://www.ft.com/content/c7af3dc6-2b3e-11e7-9ec8-168383da43b7 |work=Financial Times |location=Madrid |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motion==
===Registration===
[[File:2017MotionPodemosLogo.png|150px|thumb|upright|Logo used by [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] to promote the motion.]]
The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] required for motions of no confidence to be proposed by, at least, "one tenth of deputies"—35 out of 350—and to include "a candidate for the Presidency of the Government". For a motion of no confidence to be successful, it had to be voted favourably by at least an absolute majority (176) in the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]]. The vote could not be held until at least five days after the motion's registration, but the law allowed for other parties to fill in alternative motions within the first two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=27 April 2017 |title=¿Cómo funciona una moción de censura en España? |url=http://www.lasexta.com/programas/al-rojo-vivo/te-explicamos/como-funciona-una-mocion-de-censura-en-espana_201704275901c5dd0cf2461b6deb3557.html |language=Spanish |work=laSexta |location=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=27 April 2017 |title=Así funciona una moción de censura en España |url=http://www.antena3.com/noticias/espana/asi-funciona-mocion-censura-espana_201704275901d6070cf2461b6deb4f2c.html |language=Spanish |work=Antena 3 |location=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2017, [[Unidos Podemos]] formally registered a no confidence motion against Mariano Rajoy, moved by the group's spokesperson in Congress, [[Irene Montero]], and 36 other deputies, with [[Pablo Iglesias Turrión|Pablo Iglesias]] as the party's candidate. The text of the motion opened with the following considerations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=19 May 2017 |title=DOCUMENTO - La moción de censura de Unidos Podemos a Mariano Rajoy |url=http://www.eldiario.es/politica/DOCUMENTO-Unidos-Podemos-Mariano-Rajoy_0_645335685.html |language=Spanish |work=eldiario.es |location=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The Spanish Constitution establishes, in its article 113, that the Congress of Deputies may demand political accountability from the Government through the adoption of a motion of no confidence. The circumstances of exceptionality and democratic emergency experienced by Spain as a result of the ''parasitization'' of state institutions by the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) demand for us to make use of this democratic mechanism provided for in our Constitution.

The [[Government of Spain]], in the hands of the People's Party, has left citizens on their own by hijacking the institutions and placing them at the service of the defense of their party and of looters of the public treasury. There is no doubt that, from the Government, the PP does not respect the [[separation of powers]] and makes use of the institutions in their own interest. The credibility of Spanish democracy is at stake, both within our country, in Europe and in the rest of the world. A government that acts against the minimum rules of democracy does not represent our people.}}

Podemos candidate Pablo Iglesias invited the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] to an agreement, but acknowledged that the initiative was likely going to be defeated. Iglesias claimed that he knew he would not "come out as Prime Minister from this vote of no confidence, but it is my responsibility" and reported that "this motion will serve to mark a before and an after and to demonstrate that there is a real alternative to the PP".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gil |first1=Andrés |last2=Riveiro |first2=Aitor |date=19 May 2017 |title=Entrevista - Pablo Iglesias: "No nos da miedo el PP.

On 21 May, after [[Pedro Sánchez (Spanish politician)|Pedro Sánchez]]'s sudden re-election as PSOE leader, a new political scenario arose.

The debate on the motion of no confidence started on 13 June at 9:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] with a two-hour-long speech by [[Unidos Podemos]] spokesperson, Irene Montero, and was followed by a surprise intervention from [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] [[Mariano Rajoy]], who had been widely expected not to participate in the debate. [[Pablo Iglesias Turrión|Pablo Iglesias]]' speech as candidate followed shortly thereafter, with both Rajoy and Iglesias staging a parliamentary duel which lasted for hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Juliana |first=Enric |date=13 June 2017 |title=Podemos se eleva, Rajoy acepta el envite |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20170613/423375443512/podemos-eleva-rajoy-acepta-envite.html |language=Spanish |work=La Vanguardia |location=Madrid |access-date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Moreno |first1=José Manuel |last2=Cardenal |first2=Alfonso |date=13 June 2017 |title=Rajoy se ve legitimado por las urnas frente a la España corrupta que dibuja Podemos |url=http://cadenaser.com/ser/2017/06/13/politica/1497380875_264339.html |language=Spanish |work=Cadena SER |location=Madrid |access-date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajoy claimed that "a government of Iglesias would be a punishment for Spain",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mayor Ortega |first=Leonor |date=13 June 2017 |title=Rajoy: "Un gobierno de Iglesias sería un castigo para España" |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20170613/423373711154/mocion-de-censura-rajoy-gobierno-iglesias-castigo.html |language=Spanish |work=La Vanguardia |location=Madrid |access-date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Iglesias reminded the PP about their corruption scandals and offered the PSOE an alliance in the future to bring the PP government down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mayor Ortega |first=Leonor |date=13 June 2017 |title=Pablo Iglesias tiende la mano al PSOE para "sacar del Gobierno al PP" |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20170613/423371689029/pablo-iglesias-tiende-mano-psoe-sacar-gobierno-pp.html |language=Spanish |work=La Vanguardia |location=Madrid |access-date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new PSOE spokesperson, [[José Luís Ábalos Meco|José Luis Ábalos]], announced that the PSOE would abstain and that the motion "would not succeed" because "numbers don't add up".

==Aftermath==
As expected, the motion was defeated on 14 June 2017, having gathered the support of [[Unidos Podemos]], [[Coalició Compromís|Compromís]], [[Republican Left of Catalonia|ERC]] and [[EH Bildu]] for a total of 82 favourable votes and 170 against.&lt;ref name="MotionResult"&gt;{{cite news |last=Garea |first=Fernando |date=14 June 2017 |title=Iglesias pierde la moción de censura y solo suma a ERC, Bildu y Compromís |url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2017/06/14/actualidad/1497424691_376661.html |language=Spanish |work=El País |location=Madrid |access-date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the debate both Unidos Podemos and PSOE hinted at the possibility of a future understanding that could see them both working in a joint motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cortizo |first=Gonzalo |date=14 June 2017 |title=Fracasa la moción de censura contra Rajoy mientras Iglesias piensa ya en la siguiente |url=http://www.eldiario.es/politica/Fracasa-censura-Rajoy-Iglesias-siguiente_0_654434940.html |language=Spanish |work=eldiario.es |location=&lt;!-- Not stated --&gt; |access-date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an invitation was offered by Iglesias who, during a reply to PSOE's spokesperson José Luis Ábalos, stated that Podemos would "commit [themselves] with the new PSOE in search of an alternative majority" and urged the Socialists to "work together during the summer to negotiate a motion of no confidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Riveiro |first=Aitor |date=14 June 2017 |title=Pablo Iglesias emplaza al PSOE a "trabajar una moción de censura en verano" para echar al PP |url=http://www.eldiario.es/politica/Pablo-Iglesias-responde-Abalos_0_654434811.html |language=Spanish |work=eldiario.es |location=&lt;!-- Not stated --&gt; |access-date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Abidjan Peace Accord''' was a treaty signed in [[Abidjan]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]] on 30 November 1996 to try to bring an end to the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] (1991–2002).&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://peacemaker.un.org/sierraleone-peace-agreement-RUF96 |title=Peace Agreement between the Governement ''(sic)'' of the Republic of Sierra Leone and the RUF/SL (Abidjan Peace Agreement) |publisher=[[UN Peacemaker]]}} (document download required)&lt;/ref&gt; The two main signatories were President [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]] of [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Foday Sankoh]], leader of the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF) rebel group.&lt;ref name=APA/&gt; However, Sankoh refused to honour the terms of the agreement, and Kabbah was forced into exile by a May 1997 military coup (though he regained power the following year), so the Accord failed to bring about peace.&lt;ref name=Bangura&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bangura |first1=Yusuf |year=1997 |title=Reflections on the Abidjan Peace Accord |journal=[[Africa Development]] |publisher= |volume=XXII |issue=3/4 |pages= |jstor=43658010|doi= }}  Full text available [http://reliefweb.int/report/sierra-leone/unrisd-reflections-1996-sierra-leone-peace-accord here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The civil war began on 23 March 1991, when the RUF attempted to overthrow the government of President [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]]. A [[1992 Sierra Leonean coup d'état|1992 military coup]] saw Captain [[Valentine Strasser]], barely 25 years old, seize power, but the fighting continued. Strasser himself would be ousted by [[Julius Maada Bio]] in 1996. Peace negotiations were pursued intermittently through the regime changes.&lt;ref name=Gberie&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.c-r.org/downloads/Accord%2009_4First%20stages%20on%20the%20road%20to%20peace_2000_ENG.pdf |title=First stages on the road to peace: the Abidjan process (1995–96) |author=Lansana Gberie |publisher=[[Conciliation Resources]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 February 1996, delegations from both sides, along with United Nations Special Envoy [[Berhanu Dinka]] and representatives of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], met in Abidjan for four days.&lt;ref name=Gberie/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mutwol&gt;{{cite book |title=Peace Agreements and Civil Wars in Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vcVq5_LRLsUC&amp;pg=PA219 |publisher=Cambria Press |last=Mutwol |first=Julius |isbn=9781621968542 |pages=219–}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25–26 March, Bio and Sankoh met face-to-face for talks in [[Yamoussoukro]], [[Ivory Coast]], under the auspices of that country's president, [[Henri Konan Bédié]].&lt;ref name=Gberie/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mutwol/&gt; Days later, [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]] was elected President of Sierra Leone. Kabba and Sankoh met on 22–23 April in Yamoussoukro and agreed to a [[ceasefire]].&lt;ref name=Gberie/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mutwol/&gt; Talks continued, though both sides accused the other of breaching the ceasefire.&lt;ref name=Gberie/&gt; In October or November, Kabba again met with Sankoh, this time in Abidjan.&lt;ref name=Gberie/&gt; Finally, on 22 November, the Abidjan Peace Accord was signed, the government having made concessions and the RUF having suffered severe military defeats.&lt;ref name=Bangura/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mutwol/&gt;

==Goals==
The accord had a broad range of goals, the main ones being:&lt;ref name=APA/&gt;
* The armed conflict between the two main signatories was to end "with immediate effect." 
* A National Commission for the Consolidation of Peace was to be established within two weeks of the signing.
* A Neutral Monitoring Group would consist of monitors drawn from the "international community".
* All RUF combatants would disarm, and amnesty would be granted them.
* Efforts would be made to reintegrate RUF rebels into society.
* The government-hired [[Executive Outcomes]] and other foreign troops would leave the country after the establishment of the monitoring group.

==Signatories==
*Alhaji Dr. Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, President of the Republic of [[Sierra Leone]]
*Corporal Foday Saybana Sankoh, leader of the Revolutionary United Front
*[[Henri Konan Bédié]], President of the Republic of [[Côte d'Ivoire]]
*[[Berhanu Dinka]], Special Envoy of the [[United Nations]] Secretary-General for Sierra Leone
*Adwoa Coleman, representative of the [[Organization of African Unity]]
*Moses Anafu, representative of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth Organization]]&lt;ref name=APA/&gt;

==Results==
The National Commission for the Consolidation of Peace was set up, but accomplished little or nothing.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ayissi |first1=Anatole N. |last2=Poulton |first2=Robin |title=Bound to Cooperate: Conflict, Peace and People in Sierra Leone |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3plcSNSqLUC&amp;pg=PA39|year=2006 |publisher=United Nations Publications UNIDIR |isbn=9789290451839 |pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Neutral Monitoring Group was supposed to number 700, but the RUF objected, proposing it consist of only 120 monitors, and agreement could not be reached.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; Then RUF spokesmen and supporters of the Commission for the Consolidation of Peace, Fayia Musa, Ibrahim Deen-Jalloh and Philip Palmer, attempted to overthrow Sankoh as leader of the RUF&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; after Sankoh was arrested in Nigeria.&lt;ref name=Hirsch&gt;{{cite book |last=Hirsch |first=John L. |title=Sierra Leone: Diamonds and the Struggle for Democracy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxyVr8dEUlwC&amp;pg=PA54 |year=2001 |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers |isbn=9781555876982 |pages=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three were captured by RUF forces, and Sankoh consolidated power in the RUF.&lt;ref name=Hirsch/&gt;  A military coup on 25 May 1997 by [[Johnny Paul Koroma]], leader of the newly formed [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council]], resulted in an alliance with the RUF.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; This was certainly the death knell for any hope of peace stemming from the Abidjan Accord.

[[File:Col Younghusband and Amban.JPG|thumb|[[Youtai]], the Amban of [[Lhasa]], and Colonel [[Francis Younghusband]]]]
[[File:49. T'ang Ta-Jên, military Amban of Khotan, with his children and attendants.png|thumb|T'ang Ta-Jên, military Amban of [[Khotan]], with his children and attendants]]
'''Amban''' ([[Manchurian language|Manchu]]:{{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠠᠮᠪᠠᠨ}}''Amban'', [[Mongolian language|Mongol]]:{{MongolUnicode|lang=mn|ᠠᠮᠪᠠᠨ}}   Амбан, [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]:ཨམ་བན་''am ben'', [[Uyghur language|Uighur]]:ئامبان་''am ben'') is a Manchu language word meaning "high official," which corresponds to a number of different [[Qing#Bureaucracy|official titles]] in the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] imperial government. For instance, members of the [[Grand Council (Qing dynasty)|Grand Council]] were called ''Coohai nashūn-i amban'' ([[File:coohai1.png|50px]]) in Manchu and Qing [[Governor-General (China)|governor-generals]] were called ''Uheri kadalara amban'' ([[File:Uheri kadalara amban.png|60px]]).

The word ''amban'' was transcribed into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] as {{lang|zh|昂邦}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|ángbāng}}).

By far the most known ambans were the Qing imperial residents (Manchurian: [[File:Seremšeme tehe amban.png|60px]] ''Seremšeme tehe amban''; {{zh|t=駐紮大臣}} {{lang|zh-Latn|Zhùzhá Dàchén}}; and Tibetan: ''Ngang pai'') in [[Tibet]], [[Qinghai]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Xinjiang]], which recognized Qing authority, but were not governed as regular provinces and retained many of their existing institutions.
 
The Qing imperial residents can be roughly compared to a European [[Resident (title)|resident]] in a [[protectorate]] (e.g. a British Indian [[princely state]]), the real rapport depending on historical circumstances rather than a general job description for every amban, while his authority often was very extensive, rather like a provincial governor.

==Tibet==
{{see also|List of Qing Imperial Residents in Tibet}}
The Qing Emperor appointed an amban in [[Tibet]] ({{zh|p=Zhùzàng Dàchén |t=駐藏大臣}}), who represented Qing authority over the Buddhist theocracy of Tibet, and commanded over 2,000 troops stationed in [[Lhasa]]{{Citation needed|reason=source and time period needed for this statement|date=July 2017}}. The chief amban was aided by an  assistant amban ({{zh|labels=no |p=Bāngbàn Dàchén |t=幫辦大臣}}) and both of them reported to the Qing '''[[Lifan Yuan]]'''. Their duties included acting as intermediary between China and the Hindu kingdom of [[Nepal]] (Ghorkhas Country); a secretary ({{zh|labels=no |p=Yíqíng zhāngjīng |c=夷情章京}}) dealt with native affairs. Three Chinese commissioners ({{zh|labels=no |p=liángtái |c=糧台}}), of the class of sub-prefects, were stationed at Lhasa, Tashilumbo and Ngari. 
 
The Qing imperial resident in Tibet was introduced in 1727 and most ambasa were appointed from the Manchu [[Eight Banners]], a few were Han Chinese or Mongol. The Emperors used ambasa to supervise Tibetan politics, and the [[Qianlong Emperor|Qianlong]], [[Jiaqing Emperor|Jiaqing]] and [[Daoguang Emperor|Daoguang]] Emperors each decreed that the [[Dalai Lama]] and [[Panchen Lama]] were bound to follow the leadership or guidance of the ambasa in carrying out the administration of Tibet.

[[Zhao Erfeng]], a Han Chinese [[Eight Banners|Bannerman]], was appointed as Amban of Tibet by the Qing government. He was killed during the [[Xinhai Revolution]] by Chinese Republican Revolutionary forces intent on overthrowing the Qing dynasty. After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, the Manchu Amban Lien Yu  and his Chinese soldiers were expelled from Lhasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un88AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=atuntze+behead&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=v-gMTrXYAeHr0gH9teCSDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=chinese%20chao's%20indefatigable%20spirit%201906&amp;f=false|title=travels of a consular officer in eastern tibet|author=|year=|publisher=CUP Archive|edition=|location=|page=22|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Altishahr]], meaning six cities, consisted of [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] cities of Yarkand, Kashgar, Khotan, Kuche, Aksu, and Yangi Hisar (or Ush-Turfan).&lt;ref name=ssrcglossary&gt;{{cite web|title=Altishahr |url=http://onlinehistories.ssrc.org/centralasia/glossary/default.aspx |work=On-line Histories of Central Asia |publisher=The Eurasia Program, Social Science Research Council |accessdate=17 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322030513/http://onlinehistories.ssrc.org/centralasia/glossary/default.aspx |archivedate=22 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qing dynasty's wars with the [[Zunghar Khanate]] pushed them into the area and by 1759 they had obtained control of this region.&lt;ref name="ssrcglossary" /&gt; After the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|rebellion]] of [[Yakub Beg]], Altishahr was incorporated into the administration of Xinjiang, which became a formal province in the Qing empire in 1884. Between 1761 and 1865, the [[Qing]] Empire appointed an imperial resident (Manchu: [[File:h amban1.png|35px]] ''hebei amban''; Chinese: ''zǒnglǐ huíjiāng shìwù cānzàn dàchén'' 總理回疆事務參贊大臣) to Altishahr, which today forms part of southern [[Xinjiang]]. The imperial resident, who resided in [[Kashgar]], [[Aksu Prefecture|Ush Turfan]] or [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] and exercised Qing authority over the region. The imperial resident was controlled with local imperial agents (Manchu: [[File:b amban1.png|60px]] ''Baita icihiyara amban''; Chinese: ''Bànshì dàchén'' 辦事大臣), who were sent to most important cities in the region, where they ruled in conjunction with the local officials (Uighur:ھاكىمبەگ ''hakim beg'', Chinese: 阿奇木伯克), who were given ranks in the Qing civil service and were ultimately accountable to the imperial agent.

==Urga ==
In the holy city of [[Ulan Bator|Urga]], an amban (Mongol: {{MongolUnicode|lang=mn|ᠬᠦᠷᠢᠶᠡᠨ ᠦ&lt;br/&gt;ᠠᠮᠪᠠᠨ&lt;br/&gt;ᠨᠣᠶᠠᠨ}} Хүрээний амбан ноён, Chinese: 庫倫辦事大臣 ''Kùlún bànshì dàchén'') was stationed in order to assert Qing control over the [[Mongolia|Mongol]] dependencies. He controlled all temporal matters, and was specially charged with the control of the frontier town of [[Kiakhta]] and the trade conducted there with the Russians. Urga was also the residence of the [[Jebtsundamba Khutuktu]], who was the [[Buddhism in Mongolia|spiritual head]] of the Mongol [[Khalkha]] tribes. The Khutuktu ranked third in degree of veneration among the dignitaries in the [[Tibetan Buddhism]], after the [[Dalai Lama]] and [[Panchen Lama]]. He resided in a sacred quarter on the western side of the town and acted as a spiritual counterpart of the Qing amban.

After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, the Manchu amban was expelled by Mongol forces, fleeing to [[China proper]] via Russia.

==Manchuria==
In the early Qing, the word ''amban'' was also used in the title of the military governors  (昂邦章京, ''angbang-zhangjing'', which is a transcription of the Manchu ''amban-jianggin''; R.L.

The '''Anti-Nazi Boycott of 1933''' was a [[boycott]] of German products by foreign critics of the [[Nazi Party]] in response to an organized campaign of violence and boycotting undertaken by [[Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Party]] against the Jews of Germany following his appointment as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]] on January 30, 1933. Those in the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]]  and other places worldwide who opposed Hitler's [[antisemitic]] policies developed the boycott and its accompanying protests to encourage Nazi Germany to end the regime's often-expressed anti-Jewish attitude.

==Events in Germany==
Following Adolf Hitler's appointment as German Chancellor in January 1933, an organized campaign of violence and boycotting which was undertaken by Hitler's Nazi Party against the [[Jews of Germany]], to which critics responded with worldwide calls for protest and boycotting.

However, the [[Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens|Central Jewish Association of Germany]] was of the opinion that the Nazi government was not deliberately provoking anti-Jewish [[pogroms]]. It issued a statement of support for the regime and held that "the responsible government authorities [i.e. the Hitler regime] are unaware of the threatening situation," saying, "we do not believe our German fellow citizens will let themselves be carried away into committing excesses against the Jews."&lt;ref name="jvl1"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Policy During World War II: The Anti-Nazi Boycott|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/The_Anti-Nazi_Boycott.html|website=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, even though vandalism of Jewish businesses and property across Germany was already occurring, prominent Jewish business leaders wrote letters in support of the Nazi regime calling on officials in the Jewish community in Palestine, as well as Jewish organizations abroad, to drop their efforts in organizing an economic boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-1.652576|title=The Jews Who Opposed Boycotting Nazi Germany|author=|date=|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In point of fact, the Nazi anti-Jewish boycott was supported by the regime, with [[Hermann Göring]] stating that "I shall employ the police, and without mercy, wherever German people are hurt, but I refuse to turn the police into a guard for Jewish stores".&lt;ref name=AJHS&gt;Staff.

Accessed January 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1933, the international critics, transformed their verbal protests into a worldwide, organized economic boycott against German goods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090116052255/http://www.ajhs.org/publications/chapters/chapter.cfm?documentID=230 The Anti-Nazi Boycott of 1933], [[American Jewish Historical Society]]. Accessed January 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  

On March 24, 1933, The [[London]] [[tabloid newspaper]] ''[[The Daily Express]]'' printed an issue with the headline "Judea Declares War on Germany" detailing the Jewish boycott of German goods.  Because of the wording of the headline, [[Holocaust deniers]] have exploited the article in order to claim the Jews declared a ''literal'' war on Germany, when in fact what was described was an economic boycott.&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Alexander|title=The Holocaust: History and the War of Ideas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hoiOPKHQwGAC&amp;pg=PA190|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-3722-4|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events in the United States==

===Watchful waiting===
After seeing no improvement in the situation in the weeks following the first protests, representatives of the [[American Jewish Committee]], [[American Jewish Congress]] and [[B'nai B'rith]] met in [[New York City]] and established a joint committee to monitor the plight of German Jewry. At that point they were in agreement that any current public protests might well further harm the Jews of Germany.&lt;ref name=AJHS/&gt;

===Mass meetings===
The boycott began in March 1933 in both Europe and the US.&lt;ref name="Lang_p132"&gt;Berel Lang, ''Philosophical Witnessing: The Holocaust as Presence'', p.132&lt;/ref&gt; It continued until the entry of the US into the war.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Dollinger, ''Quest for Inclusion: Jews and Liberalism in Modern America'' (Princeton University Press, 2000), p.48. {{ISBN|9780691005096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unrelenting Nazi abuse of Jews in Germany in the subsequent weeks led the American Jewish Congress to reconsider its opposition to public protests. In a contentious four-hour meeting held at the [[Hotel Astor]] in New York City on March 20, 1933, 1,500 representatives of various Jewish organizations met to consider a proposal by the American Jewish Congress to hold a protest meeting at [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] on March 27, 1933, as an additional 1,000 people attempting to enter the meeting were held back by police.  [[New York Supreme Court]] Justice [[Joseph M. Proskauer]] and [[James N. Rosenberg]] spoke out against a proposed boycott of German goods that had been introduced by [[J. George Freedman]] of the [[Jewish War Veterans]]. Proskauer expressed his concerns against "causing more trouble for the Jews in Germany by unintelligent action", protesting against plans for mass meetings and reading a letter from Judge [[Irving Lehman]] that warned that "the meeting may add to the terrible dangers of the Jews in Germany".  Honorary president [[Rabbi]] [[Stephen Samuel Wise]] delivered a rejoinder to Proskauer and Rosenberg, criticizing their failure to attend previous AJCongress meetings and insisting that "no attention would be paid to the edict" if mass protests had been rejected by the group. Wise noted that "The time for prudence and caution is past. We must speak up like men. How can we ask our Christian friends to lift their voices in protest against the wrongs suffered by Jews if we keep silent? … What is happening in Germany today may happen tomorrow in any other land on earth unless its is challenged and rebuked. It is not the German Jews who are being attacked. It is the Jews." The group voted to go ahead with the meeting at Madison Square Garden.&lt;ref name=AJHS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

In a meeting held at the Hotel Knickerbocker on March 21 by the [[Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America]], former congressman [[William W. Cohen]] advocated in support of a strict boycott of German goods, stating that "Any Jew buying one penny's worth of merchandise made in Germany is a traitor to his people." The Jewish War Veterans planned a protest march in Manhattan from [[Cooper Square]] to [[New York City Hall]], in which 20,000 would participate, including Jewish veterans in uniform, with no banners or placards allowed other than American and Jewish flags.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

A series of protest rallies were held on March 27, 1933, with the New York City rally held at Madison Square Garden with an overflow crowd of 55,000 inside and outside the arena and parallel events held in [[Baltimore]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[Philadelphia]] and 70 other locations, with the proceedings at the New York rally broadcast worldwide. Speakers at the Garden included [[American Federation of Labor]] president [[William Green (labor leader)|William Green]], Senator [[Robert F.

==Nazi counter-boycott==

The Nazis and some outside Germany portrayed the boycott as an act of aggression, with the British newspaper the ''[[Daily Express]]'' using the headline: "Judea Declares War on Germany" on March 24, 1933.&lt;ref name="Lang_p132"/&gt; Nazi officials countered the protests as slanders against the Nazis perpetrated by "Jews of German origin", with their [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] proclaiming that a series of "sharp countermeasures" would be taken against the Jews of Germany in response to the protests of American Jews. Goebbels announced a one-day [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|boycott of Jewish businesses in Germany]] of his own to commence on April 1, 1933 that Aryan Germans would aim against Jewish-owned businesses, which would be lifted if anti-Nazi protests were suspended.&lt;ref name="Lang_p132"/&gt; This was the German government's first officially sanctioned anti-Jewish boycott. If the protests did not cease, Goebbels warned that "the boycott will be resumed... until German Jewry has been annihilated".&lt;ref name=AJHS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, Edwin L. [https://www.nytimes.com/1933/04/02/archives/the-nazis-begin-to-dodge-antisemitic-boomerang-hitlerites-weaken-on.html "THE NAZIS BEGIN TO DODGE ANTI-SEMITIC BOOMERANG; Hitlerites Weaken on Jewish Boycott in Face of World-Wide Protests and Peril to German Trade.

The [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses]] threatened by Goebbels occurred. [[Sturmabteilung|Brownshirts of the SA]] were placed outside Jewish-owned department stores, retail establishments and professional offices. The Star of David was painted in yellow and black on retail entrances and windows, and posters asserting "Don't Buy from Jews!" (''Kauf nicht bei Juden!'') and "The Jews Are Our Misfortune!" (''Die Juden sind unser Unglück!'') were pasted around. Physical violence against Jews and vandalism of Jewish-owned property took place, but the police intervened only rarely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005678 "BOYCOTT OF JEWISH BUSINESSES"], [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]''. Accessed January 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The [[Association of German National Jews]], a marginal group that had supported Hitler in his early years, had fought against the Jewish boycott of German goods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,757240-1,00.html "Books: Vicious Circle. Robert Gessner, Some Of My Best Friends Are Jews (Farrar &amp; Rinehart)"] ''[[Time (magazine)]]'', December 21, 1936. Accessed December 26, 2016. "''But after he visited a famed rabbi in Munich, wandered through the ghetto in Berlin, talked with Zionists, Jewish workers, capitalists, he found himself appalled at the conduct of the Association of German National Jews. This organization supports Hitler, fights the Jewish boycott of German goods.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon47"&gt;Sarah Ann Gordon, ''Hitler, Germans, and the "Jewish question"'', p.47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pegelow Kaplan.

September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Haavara Agreement]], together with lessened dependence on trade with the West, had by 1937 largely negated the effects of the Jewish boycott on Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Nicosia, Francis R. ''The Third Reich and the Palestine Question '', p.150&lt;/ref&gt; 

The boycott (which lasted until the entrance of the United States into World War II) did nothing to stop the harassment of Jews in Germany. Rabbi Wise characterized the boycott as morally imperative expression, stating, "We must speak out," and "if that is unavailing, at least we shall have spoken."&lt;ref name=AJHS/&gt;

{{Antisemitism}}
The modern [[Olympic Games]] or Olympics, are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and [[Winter Games]] alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/Olympic-Games|title=Olympic Games|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Olympic Games during the years, although its approach of "peace through sport", there have been many expressions of [[antisemitism]], and at least in 1972, which ended in the death of eleven Israeli athletes. Because Israel is the only Jewish state, most of the manifestations of antisemitism have taken anti-Israel forms.

A '''carbon credit''' is a  generic term for any tradable certificate or permit representing the right to emit one [[tonne]] of carbon dioxide or the mass of another [[greenhouse gas]] with a [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] (tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e) equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name="ced"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epav"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.vic.gov.au/climate-change/glossary.asp#CAM |title=Climate change glossary |work=Carbon credit  |publisher=Environment Protection Authority Victoria |date=2008-09-02 |accessdate=2010-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912151614/http://www.epa.vic.gov.au/climate-change/glossary.asp |archivedate=2010-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="id"/&gt;

Carbon credits and carbon markets are a component of national and international attempts to mitigate the growth in concentrations of [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHGs). One carbon credit is equal to one tonne of carbon dioxide, or in some markets, carbon dioxide equivalent gases. Carbon trading is an application of an [[emissions trading]] approach.  Greenhouse gas emissions are capped and then [[market (economics)|market]]s are used to allocate the emissions among the group of regulated sources.

The goal is to allow market mechanisms to drive industrial and commercial processes in the direction of low emissions or less carbon intensive approaches than those used when there is no cost to emitting [[carbon dioxide]] and other GHGs into the atmosphere. Since GHG mitigation projects generate credits, this approach can be used to finance [[carbon project|carbon reduction schemes]] between trading partners and around the world.

There are also many companies that sell carbon credits to commercial and individual customers who are interested in lowering their [[carbon footprint]] on a voluntary basis. These [[carbon offset]]ters purchase the credits from an investment fund or a carbon development company that has aggregated the credits from individual projects.  Buyers and sellers can also use an exchange platform to trade, which is like a stock exchange for carbon credits.  The quality of the credits is based in part on the validation process and sophistication of the fund or development company that acted as the sponsor to the [[carbon project]]. This is reflected in their price; voluntary units typically have less value than the units sold through the rigorously validated [[Clean Development Mechanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unfccc.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/071120_pressconference07/templ/ply_unfccc.php?id_kongresssession=806&amp;player_mode=isdn_real |title=Making Kyoto work:data, policies, infrastructures |publisher=UNFCCC press briefing |date=2007-11-20|accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The Collins English Dictionary defines a carbon credit as “''a certificate showing that a government or company has paid to have a certain amount of carbon dioxide removed from the environment''”.&lt;ref name="ced"&gt;{{cite web |title=Carbon Credit|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/carbon-credit |publisher=Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved October 04, 2012 from CollinsDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Environment Protection Authority of Victoria defines a carbon credit as a “''generic term to assign a value to a reduction or offset of greenhouse gas emissions.. usually equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent  (CO2-e).''”&lt;ref name="epav"/&gt;

The [[Investopedia]] Inc investment dictionary defines a carbon credit as a “''permit that allows the holder to emit one ton of carbon dioxide''”..which “''can be traded in the international market at their current market price''”.&lt;ref name="id"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carbon_credit.asp |title=Investment Dictionary |work=Carbon Credit Definition |publisher=Investopedia Inc |accessdate=2010-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are two main markets for carbon credits;
Compliance Market credits
Secondary / Verified Market credits (VERs) &lt;ref name="Advanced Global Trading" &gt;[[Advanced Global Trading]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The burning of fossil fuels is a major source of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially for power, cement, steel, textile, fertilizer and many other industries which rely on fossil fuels (coal, electricity derived from coal, natural gas and oil). The major greenhouse gases emitted by these industries are [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], [[nitrous oxide]], [[Fluorocarbon#Chlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons|hydrofluorocarbons]] (HFCs), etc., all of which increase the atmosphere's ability to trap infrared energy and thus affect the [[Climate Change|climate]].

The concept of carbon credits came into existence as a result of increasing awareness of the need for controlling emissions. The IPCC ([[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]) has observed&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.mnp.nl/ipcc/docs/FAR/Approved%20SPM%20WGIII_0705rev5.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Policies that provide a real or implicit price of carbon could create incentives for producers and consumers to significantly invest in low-GHG products, technologies and processes. Such policies could include economic instruments, government funding and regulation'',
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
while noting that a tradable permit system is one of the policy instruments that has been shown to be environmentally effective in the industrial sector, as long as there are reasonable levels of predictability over the initial allocation mechanism and long-term price.

The mechanism was formalized in the [[Kyoto Protocol]], an international agreement between more than 170 countries, and the market mechanisms were agreed through the subsequent [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#2001 – COP 7, Marrakech, Morocco|Marrakesh Accords]].
The mechanism adopted was similar to the successful US [[Acid Rain Program]] to reduce some industrial pollutants.

=== Emission allowances ===
Under the [[Kyoto Protocol]], the 'caps' or [[wikt:quota|quotas]] for [[Greenhouse gases]] for the developed [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I countries|Annex 1]] countries are known as '''Assigned Amounts''' and are listed in Annex B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/3145.php |title=Kyoto Protocol Targets|publisher=UNFCCC |accessdate = 2010-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The quantity of the initial assigned amount is denominated in individual units, called [[Assigned amount units]] (AAUs), each of which represents an allowance to emit one metric tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, and these are entered into the country's national registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/publications/08_unfccc_kp_ref_manual.pdf |title=Kyoto Protocol Reference Manual On Accounting of Emissions and Assigned Amount |publisher=UNFCCC |accessdate=2010-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, these countries set quotas on the emissions of installations run by local business and other organizations, generically termed 'operators'. Countries manage this through their national registries, which are required to be validated and monitored for compliance by the [[UNFCCC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/compliance/items/2875.php |title=UNFCCC Compliance under the Kyoto Protocol |publisher=UNFCCC|accessdate = 2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each operator has an allowance of credits, where each unit gives the owner the right to emit one metric tonne of [[carbon dioxide]] or other equivalent [[greenhouse gas]]. Operators that have not used up their quotas can sell their unused allowances as carbon credits, while businesses that are about to exceed their quotas can buy the extra allowances as credits, privately or on the open market.
As demand for energy grows over time, the total emissions must still stay within the cap, but it allows industry some flexibility and predictability in its planning to accommodate this.

By permitting allowances to be bought and sold, an operator can seek out the most cost-effective way of reducing its emissions, either by investing in 'cleaner' machinery and practices or by purchasing emissions from another operator who already has excess 'capacity'.

Since 2005, the Kyoto mechanism has been adopted for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; trading by all the countries within the [[European Union]] under its [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|European Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS) with the [[European Commission]] as its validating authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/469&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=1&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=EU climate change policies: Commission asks member states to fulfill their obligations |publisher=EUROPA - Press Releases |date=2006-04-06  |accessdate=2010-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2008, EU participants must link with [[List of Kyoto Protocol signatories|the other developed countries]] who [[ratification|ratified]] [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I countries|Annex I]] of the protocol, and trade the six most significant [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] greenhouse gases.  In the [[United States]], which has not ratified Kyoto, and [[Australia]], whose ratification came into force in March 2008, similar schemes are being considered.

=== Kyoto's 'Flexible mechanisms' ===
A tradable credit can be an emissions allowance or an [[Assigned amount units|assigned amount unit]] which was originally allocated or auctioned by the national administrators of a Kyoto-compliant cap-and-trade scheme, or it can be an [[carbon offset|offset]] of emissions. Such offsetting and mitigating activities can occur in any developing country which has ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and has a national agreement in place to validate its [[carbon project]] through one of the [[UNFCCC]]'s approved mechanisms. Once approved, these units are termed [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s, or CERs. The Protocol allows these projects to be constructed and credited in advance of the Kyoto trading period.

The Kyoto Protocol provides for three mechanisms that enable countries or operators in developed countries to acquire greenhouse gas reduction credits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/items/1673.php  |title=The Mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol |publisher=UNFCCC |accessdate=2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Under [[Joint Implementation]] (JI) a developed country with relatively high costs of domestic greenhouse reduction would set up a project in another developed country.
* Under the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) a developed country can 'sponsor' a greenhouse gas reduction project in a developing country where the cost of greenhouse gas reduction project activities is usually much lower, but the atmospheric effect is globally equivalent. The developed country would be given credits for meeting its emission reduction targets, while the developing country would receive the capital investment and [[clean technology]] or beneficial [[Land use, land-use change and forestry|change in land use]].
* Under International [[Emissions Trading]] (IET) countries can trade in the international carbon credit market to cover their shortfall in [[Assigned amount units]]. Countries with surplus units can sell them to countries that are exceeding their emission targets under Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol.

These [[carbon project]]s can be created by a national government or by an operator within the country.
In reality, most of the transactions are not performed by national governments directly, but by operators who have been set quotas by their country.

=== Emission markets ===
For trading purposes, one allowance or CER is considered equivalent to one [[metric ton]] of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. These allowances can be sold privately or in the international market at the prevailing market price.  These trade and [[Settlement (finance)|settle]] internationally and hence allow allowances to be transferred between countries. Each international transfer is validated by the [[UNFCCC]]. Each transfer of ownership within the European Union is additionally validated by the European Commission.

Climate exchanges have been established to provide a [[spot market]] in allowances, as well as [[Futures market|futures]] and [[Option (finance)|options]] [[Futures exchange|market]] to help discover a market price and maintain [[market liquidity|liquidity]]. Carbon prices are normally quoted in [[Euro]]s per tonne of carbon dioxide or its equivalent (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e). Other greenhouse gasses can also be traded, but are quoted as standard multiples of carbon dioxide with respect to their [[global warming potential]].  These features reduce the quota's financial impact on business, while ensuring that the quotas are met at a national and international level.

Currently there are five exchanges trading in carbon allowances: the [[European Climate Exchange]], [[NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe]], [[Powernext|PowerNext]], [[Commodity Exchange Bratislava]] and the [[European Energy Exchange]].  NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe listed a contract to trade offsets generated by a CDM [[carbon project]] called Certified Emission Reductions (CERs). Many companies now engage in emissions abatement, offsetting, and sequestration programs to generate credits that can be sold on one of the exchanges. At least one [[private electronic market]] has been established in 2008: CantorCO2e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-184638199.html |title=CantorCO2e Launches First Internet CER Auction  |publisher=CantorCO2e |date=2008-09-09 |accessdate=2010-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon credits at Commodity Exchange Bratislava are traded at special platform - Carbon place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carbonplace.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

Managing emissions is one of the fastest-growing segments in financial services in the [[City of London]] with a market estimated to be worth about €30 billion in 2007. Louis Redshaw, head of environmental markets at [[Barclays Capital]] predicts that "Carbon will be the world's biggest commodity market, and it could become the world's biggest market overall."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kanter |first=James |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/20/business/worldbusiness/20iht-money.4.6234700.html?_r=1 |title=Carbon trading: Where greed is green |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2007-06-20 |accessdate=2010-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Setting a market price for carbon ===
{{More footnotes|section|date=August 2008}}
Unchecked, energy use and hence emission levels are predicted to keep rising over time. Thus the number of companies needing to buy credits will increase, and the rules of [[supply and demand]] will [[Elasticity (economics)|push up the market price]], encouraging more groups to undertake environmentally friendly activities that create carbon credits to sell.
 
An individual allowance, such as an [[Assigned amount units|Assigned amount unit]] (AAU) or its near-equivalent European Union Allowance (EUA), may have a different market value to an offset such as a CER.  This is due to the lack of a developed secondary market for CERs, a lack of homogeneity between projects which causes difficulty in pricing, as well as questions due to the principle of [[supplementarity]] and its lifetime.  Additionally, offsets generated by a [[carbon project]] under the Clean Development Mechanism are potentially limited in value because operators in the EU ETS are restricted as to what percentage of their allowance can be met through these flexible mechanisms.

Yale University economics professor [[William Nordhaus]] argues that the price of carbon needs to be high enough to motivate the changes in behavior and changes in economic production systems necessary to effectively limit emissions of [[greenhouse gases]]. &lt;blockquote&gt;
Raising the price of carbon will achieve four goals. First, it will provide signals to consumers about what goods and services are high-carbon ones and should therefore be used more sparingly. Second, it will provide signals to producers about which inputs use more carbon (such as coal and oil) and which use less or none (such as natural gas or nuclear power), thereby inducing firms to substitute low-carbon inputs. Third, it will give market incentives for inventors and innovators to develop and introduce low-carbon products and processes that can replace the current generation of technologies. Fourth, and most important, a high carbon price will economize on the information that is required to do all three of these tasks. Through the market mechanism, a high carbon price will raise the price of products according to their carbon content. Ethical consumers today, hoping to minimize their “carbon footprint,” have little chance of making an accurate calculation of the relative carbon use in, say, driving 250 miles as compared with flying 250 miles. A harmonized carbon tax would raise the price of a good proportionately to exactly the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is emitted in all the stages of production that are involved in producing that good. If 0.01 of a ton of carbon emissions results from the wheat growing and the milling and the trucking and the baking of a loaf of bread, then a tax of $30 per ton carbon will raise the price of bread by $0.30. The “carbon footprint” is automatically calculated by the price system. Consumers would still not know how much of the price is due to carbon emissions, but they could make their decisions confident that they are paying for the social cost of their carbon footprint.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Nordhaus has suggested, based on the social cost of carbon emissions, that an optimal price of carbon is around $30(US) per ton and will need to increase with inflation.&lt;blockquote&gt;
The social cost of carbon is the additional damage caused by an additional ton of carbon emissions. ... The optimal carbon price, or optimal carbon tax, is the market price (or carbon tax) on carbon emissions that balances the incremental costs of reducing carbon emissions with the incremental benefits of reducing climate damages. ... [I]f a country wished to impose a carbon tax of $30 per ton of carbon, this would involve a tax on gasoline of about 9 cents per gallon. Similarly, the tax on coal-generated electricity would be about 1 cent per kWh, or 10 percent of the current retail price. At current levels of carbon emissions in the United States, a tax of $30 per ton of carbon would generate $50 billion of revenue per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=William |last=Nordhaus, |year=2008 |url=http://nordhaus.econ.yale.edu/Balance_2nd_proofs.pdf |title=A Question of Balance - Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies |publisher=Yale University Press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910214411/http://nordhaus.econ.yale.edu/Balance_2nd_proofs.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==How buying carbon credits can reduce emissions==
{{No footnotes|section|date=August 2011}}
{{See also|Economics of global warming}}

Carbon credits create a market for reducing greenhouse emissions by giving a monetary value to the cost of polluting the air. Emissions become an internal cost of doing business and are visible on the [[balance sheet]] alongside [[raw materials]] and other [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] or [[assets]].

For example, consider a business that owns a factory putting out 100,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in a year.  Its government is an Annex I country that enacts a law to limit the emissions that the business can produce. So the factory is given a quota of say 80,000 tonnes per year. The factory either reduces its emissions to 80,000 tonnes or is required to purchase carbon credits to offset the excess. After costing up alternatives the business may decide that it is uneconomical or infeasible to invest in new machinery for that year. Instead it may choose to buy carbon credits on the open market from organizations that have been approved as being able to sell legitimate carbon credits.

We should consider the impact of manufacturing alternative energy sources. For example, the energy consumed and the Carbon emitted in the manufacture and transportation of a large wind turbine would prohibit a credit being issued for a predetermined period of time.

* One seller might be a company that will offer to [[carbon offset|offset emissions]] through a project in the developing world, such as recovering methane from a swine farm to feed a power station that previously would use fossil fuel. So although the factory continues to emit gases, it would pay another group to reduce the equivalent of 20,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere for that year.
* Another seller may have already invested in new low-emission machinery and have a surplus of allowances as a result. The factory could make up for its emissions by buying 20,000 tonnes of allowances from them. The cost of the seller's new machinery would be subsidized by the sale of allowances. Both the buyer and the seller would submit accounts for their emissions to prove that their allowances were met correctly.

=== Credits versus taxes ===
Carbon credits and carbon taxes each have their advantages and disadvantages. Credits were chosen by the signatories to the Kyoto Protocol as an alternative to [[Carbon tax]]es. A criticism of tax-raising schemes is that they are frequently not [[hypothecation (taxation)|hypothecated]], and so some or all of the taxation raised by a government would be applied based on what the particular nation's government deems most fitting.  However, some would argue that carbon trading is based around creating a lucrative artificial market, and, handled by free market enterprises as it is, carbon trading is not necessarily a focused or easily regulated solution.

By treating emissions as a market [[commodity]] some proponents insist it becomes easier for businesses to understand and manage their activities, while economists and traders can attempt to predict future pricing using market theories. Thus the main advantages of a tradeable carbon credit over a carbon tax are argued to be:
* the price may be more likely to be perceived as fair by those paying it.  Investors in credits may have more control over their own costs.
* the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol help to ensure that all investment goes into genuine sustainable carbon reduction schemes through an internationally agreed validation process.
* some proponents state that if correctly implemented a target level of emission reductions may somehow be achieved with more certainty, while under a tax the actual emissions might vary over time.
* it may provide a framework for rewarding people or companies who plant trees or otherwise meet standards exclusively recognized as "green."

The advantages of a carbon tax are argued to be:
* possibly less complex, expensive, and time-consuming to implement.  This advantage is especially great when applied to markets like gasoline or home heating oil.
* perhaps some reduced risk of certain types of cheating, though under both credits and taxes, emissions must be verified.
* reduced incentives for companies to delay efficiency improvements prior to the establishment of the baseline if credits are distributed in proportion to past emissions.
* when credits are grandfathered, this puts new or growing companies at a disadvantage relative to more established companies.
* allows for more centralized handling of acquired gains
* worth of carbon is stabilized by government regulation rather than market fluctuations. Poor market conditions and weak investor interest have a lessened impact on taxation as opposed to carbon trading.

== Creating carbon credits ==
The principle of [[Supplementarity]] within the Kyoto Protocol means that internal abatement of emissions should take precedence before a country buys in carbon credits. However it also established the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] as a Flexible Mechanism by which capped entities could develop measurable and permanent emissions reductions voluntarily in sectors outside the cap.  Many criticisms of carbon credits stem from the fact that establishing that an emission of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalent greenhouse gas has truly been reduced involves a complex process.  This process has evolved as the concept of a [[carbon project]] has been refined over the past 10 years.

The first step in determining whether or not a [[carbon project]] has legitimately led to the reduction of measurable and permanent emissions is understanding the CDM methodology process.  This is the process by which project sponsors submit, through a Designated Operational Entity (DOE), their concepts for emissions reduction creation.  The CDM Executive Board, with the CDM Methodology Panel and their expert advisors, review each project and decide how and if they do indeed result in reductions that are additional&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdm.unfccc.int UNFCCC CDM project database]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Additionality and its importance === &lt;!-- This section is linked from redirect "[[Additionality]]" --&gt;
{{No footnotes|section|date=August 2008}}
It is also important for any carbon credit (offset) to prove a concept called [[additionality]]. The concept of [[additionality]] addresses the question of whether the project would have happened in the absence of an intervention in the form of the price signal of carbon credits. Only projects with emissions below their baseline level, defined as emissions under a scenario without this price signal (holding all other factors constant), represent a net environmental benefit. Carbon projects that yield strong financial returns even in the absence of revenue from carbon credits; or that are compelled by regulations; or that represent common practice in an industry; are usually not considered additional. A full determination of additionality requires a careful investigation of proposed carbon offset projects.

It is generally agreed that voluntary carbon offset projects must demonstrate [[additionality]] to ensure the legitimacy of the environmental stewardship claims resulting from the retirement of carbon credits (offsets).

=== Criticisms ===
The Kyoto mechanism is the only internationally agreed mechanism for regulating carbon credit activities,  and, crucially, includes checks for additionality and overall effectiveness. Its supporting organisation, the UNFCCC, is the only organisation with a global mandate on the overall effectiveness of emission control systems, although enforcement of decisions relies on national co-operation. The Kyoto trading period only applies for five years between 2008 and 2012. The first phase of the EU ETS system started before then, and is expected to continue in a third phase afterwards, and may co-ordinate with whatever is internationally agreed at but there is general uncertainty as to what will be agreed in [[Post–Kyoto Protocol negotiations on greenhouse gas emissions]]. As business investment often operates over decades, this adds risk and uncertainty to their plans. As several countries responsible for a large proportion of global emissions (notably USA, India, China) have avoided mandatory caps, this also means that businesses in capped countries may perceive themselves to be working at a competitive disadvantage against those in uncapped countries as they are now paying for their carbon costs directly.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

A key concept behind the cap and trade system is that national quotas should be chosen to represent genuine and meaningful reductions in national output of emissions. Not only does this ensure that overall emissions are reduced but also that the costs of emissions trading are  carried fairly across all parties to the trading system. However, governments of capped countries may seek to unilaterally weaken their commitments, as evidenced by the 2006 and 2007 [[National Allocation Plan]]s for several countries in the EU ETS, which were submitted late and then were initially rejected by the [[European Commission]] for being too lax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L12929039.htm |title=France and Italy seek to avoid EU carbon clash |publisher=Reuters AlertNet - www.alertnet.org |date=2006-12-13 |accessdate=2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A question has been raised over the [[grandfathering]] of allowances. Countries within the EU ETS have granted their incumbent businesses most or all of their allowances for free. This can sometimes be perceived as a protectionist obstacle to new entrants into their markets. There have also been accusations of power generators getting a 'windfall' profit by passing on these emissions 'charges' to their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Carr |first=Mathew |last2=Kishan |first2=Saijel  |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=awS1xfKpVRs8&amp;refer=home |title=Europe Fails Kyoto Standards as Trading Scheme Helps Polluters |publisher=Bloomberg.com |accessdate=2010-01-27 |date=2006-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the EU ETS moves into its second phase and joins up with Kyoto, it seems likely that these problems will be reduced as more allowances will be auctioned. 

Some sources &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/897fc1b4-4219-11dd-a5e8-0000779fd2ac&lt;/ref&gt; shows that UK financial service wins a lot from Carbon credit trade. The profit is evident if one check the statistics: London has 
secured dominance on the global carbon trading market, with net value $64bn in 2007, according to the report by [[International Financial Services London]]. London controlled about 90% of the exchange market (Carbon credit vs money) in 2007. London-based companies made about 59% of the purchases of Carbon credits issued by the [[UN]]. And some of the  Carbon credit's system creators are from UK, for example, the economist, former Senior Vice-President of the [[World Bank]] and government economic advisor in the United Kingdom [[Nicholas Stern, Baron Stern of Brentford]] who has founded a consultancy-trading agency "The Carbon Rating Agency (CRA)" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.carbonratingsagency.com/cra/about-us/advisory-board.htm&lt;/ref&gt; on the Isle-of-Man (controlled by firm IDEAglobal Group &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ideaglobal.com/corporate/advisory.html&lt;/ref&gt; there Stern was a Vice Chairman at that time &lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/sir-nicholas-stern-to-join-ideaglobal-group-as-vice-chairman-153720615.html&lt;/ref&gt;) for Carbon credit evaluation and firm's rating and making money on that. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/897fc1b4-4219-11dd-a5e8-0000779fd2ac&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Crusader Kings II: Sons of Abraham''''' is an [[downloadable content]] pack developed by [[Paradox Development Studio]] and published by [[Paradox Interactive]] for the [[grand strategy wargame]] ''[[Crusader Kings II]]''. The [[expansion pack]] created more events and interactions with the [[Christian]], [[Islamic]] and [[Jewish]] religions within the game. There were concerns by the production staff that elements included such as the ability to expel Jews from the player-held lands and the ability to create the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] could lead to criticism. Game critics were mostly positive of the game, with praise directed at the new gameplay elements introduced.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Expulsion judios-en.svg|thumb|right|The real-world expulsions of Jews in Europe from 1100 to 1600]]
The ''Sons of Abraham'' expansion increased the events and interactions with religion in ''[[Crusader Kings 2]]''.&lt;ref name=announced/&gt; While the previous expansion pack to the game, entitled ''The Old Gods'', was primarily about paganism, ''Sons of Abraham'' was intended to expand on [[Judaism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]]. For example, the [[Catholic]] religion is expanded by introducing the [[College of Cardinals]], thereby increasing the interaction between the player's ruler character and the reigning [[Pope]]. It allows the Pope to choose who is admitted to become one of the nine standing [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]s based on a number of attributes, with a preference for members of the Italian culture.&lt;ref name=gsann/&gt; Jewish characters are playable for the first time and allows the player to restore the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]], build the [[Third Temple]] and bring back the [[Priesthood (Ancient Israel)|Priesthood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ben-Gedalyahu|first1=Tzvi|title=New Crusader Kings II ‘Sons of Abraham’ Lets Jews Rebuild Temple|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/new-crusader-kings-ii-sons-of-abraham-lets-jews-rebuild-temple/2013/10/25/|accessdate=February 21, 2015|work=The Jewish Press|date=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Islamic characters can choose to become members of the [[Mu`tazila]] or [[Ash'ari]] [[Islamic theology|theologies]], with penalties being suffered towards members of the other theology.&lt;ref name=gsann&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaston|first1=Martin|title=Crusader Kings II gets Sons of Abraham expansion this November|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/crusader-kings-ii-gets-sons-of-abraham-expansion-this-november/1100-6415727/|publisher=GameSpot|date=October 23, 2013|accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion modifies the economy in ''[[Crusader Kings II]]'' to require greater financial upkeep. This is balanced by the ability to borrow money from either a number of [[Military order (monastic society)|holy military orders]] or [[Jewish]] lenders. As with the real-world [[Alhambra Decree]], in which the joint [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Spain, [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], the game allows the player to expel the Jewish population from their held lands. This will remove all Jewish characters, default on any debts owed to Jewish money lenders, and prevent the player from borrowing any further money from those Jewish lenders in the future.&lt;ref name=zacny/&gt;

Religious [[Heresy|heresies]] have been expanded to receive individual powers other than those held by the main religion in each case. For example, [[Catharism]] allows its followers to appoint women as [[bishop]]s. Also, once a heresy increases in power sufficient to outnumber the orthodoxy, then the former orthodoxy becomes the heresy and vice versa. When this happens, any holy military orders which previously followed the old orthodox religion will switch to follow the former heresy. Those holy orders can also gain lands of their own, and may build castles in empty provinces in other territories.&lt;ref name=zacny/&gt;

==Development and release==
The expansion pack was announced via Paradox Interactive's [[twitch.tv]] stream at 6pm [[GMT]] on October 22, 2013. It is the fifth major expansion pack for the game.&lt;ref name=announced/&gt; The lead designer on ''Sons of Abraham'' was [[Henrik Fåhraeus]], who said that the production team were careful about how they introduced interactions with the Jewish faith. He explained that while elements of the game were already dark, but "you do some things that you can’t do in other games, so we felt that it could be done."&lt;ref name=zacny&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zacny|first1=Rob|title=Sons of Abraham expansion takes Crusader Kings 2 into fraught territory|url=http://www.pcgamesn.com/sons-abraham-expansion-takes-crusader-kings-2-fraught-territory|publisher=PCGamesN|accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the ability to expel the Jewish population, Fåhraeus said that the mechanic was designed to hurt the player in the long run.&lt;ref name=zacny/&gt;

The ability to play as a Jewish character was not previously available in the game as the production team didn't consider that there were any significant Jewish rulers from 1066 onwards, but with the earlier setting beginning in ''The Old Gods'', the [[Khazars|Khazar Khanate]] was changed from following [[Tengrism]] to Judaism. This reflects the historical record of the 8th century. Fåhraeus did not fear any backlash to the inclusion of the reformation of the Kingdom of Israel,&lt;ref name=allconq/&gt; and compared it to earlier expansions where the player could reform the [[Roman Empire]] as the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] or [[Zoroastrian]] characters reforming the [[Persian Empire]].&lt;ref name=allconq/&gt;

While writing for [[IGN]] in Italy, Di Claudio Chianese described ''Sons of Abraham'' as building on the solid foundation formed by the original game. But he felt like it didn't go far enough in the expansion of the religions, and missed out on the chance to play as the Pope. But he felt that it would be well received by experienced gamers of ''Crusader Kings II''.&lt;ref name=italianign/&gt;

Luke Plunkett, in a preview piece for [[Kotaku]], described Paradox Interactive as having "brass balls" due to the inclusion of Israel within the game.&lt;ref name=allconq&gt;{{cite web|last1=Plunkett|first1=Luke|title=PC Game Lets You Play As The Mighty Conquering Jews|url=http://kotaku.com/pc-game-lets-you-play-as-the-mighty-conquering-jews-1451086958|publisher=Kotaku|date=October 24, 2013|accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the expansion by ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' magazine likened the experience of trying to rule as the Jewish Khazars as repetitive as the main character from the film ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'' trying to save an old man. This is because in their experience, playing as [[Isaac (Khazar)|Isaac]] of the Khazars often ended with the character dying after a few years without issue, ending the game quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crusader Kings II: wilful obscurantism as a design ethos|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/crusader-kings-ii-wilful-obscurantism-as-a-design-ethos/|accessdate=February 21, 2015|work=Edge|date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Youth rights sidebar}}

A '''curfew''' is an order specifying a time during which certain regulations apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/curfew|title=curfew - definition of curfew in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/curfew|title=Curfew - Define Curfew at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically it refers to the time when individuals are required to return to and stay in their homes. Such an order may be issued by public authorities but also by the head of a household to those living in the household. For instance, an [[au pair|au pair ]] is typically given a curfew, which regulates when they must return to the host family's home in the evening.

== Etymology ==
The word "curfew" comes from the [[French language|French]] phrase "''couvre-feu''", which means "fire cover". It was later adopted into [[Middle English]]  as "curfeu", which later became the modern "curfew".&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|curfew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its original meaning refers to a law made by [[William The Conqueror]] that all lights and fires should be covered at the ringing of an eight o'clock bell to prevent the spread of destructive fire within communities in timber buildings.&lt;ref&gt;''Bailey's Dictionary'', fifth edition 1731&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
# An order issued by the public authorities or military forces requiring everyone or certain people to be indoors at certain times, often at night. It can be imposed to maintain public order (such as those after the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003]], the [[2005 civil unrest in France]], the [[2010 Chile earthquake]], the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]], and the [[2014 Ferguson unrest]]), or suppress targeted groups. Curfews have long been directed at certain groups in many cities or states, such as [[Japanese-American]] university students on the [[West Coast of the United States]] during [[World War II]], [[African-American]]s in many towns during the time of [[Jim Crow laws]], or people younger than a certain age (usually within a few years either side of 18) in many towns of the [[United States]] since the 1980s; see below.
# An order by the [[legal guardian]]s of a teenager to return home by a specific time, usually in the evening or night. This may apply daily, or vary with the day of the week, e.g., if the minor has to go to school the next day.
# An order by the head of household to a domestic assistant such as an au pair or [[nanny]]. The domestic assistant must then return home by a specific time.
# A daily requirement for guests to return to their [[hostel]] before a specified time, usually in the evening or night.
# In [[baseball]], a time after which a game must end, or play be suspended. For example, in the [[American League]] the curfew rule for many years decreed that no [[innings|inning]] could begin after 1 am local time (with the exception of international games).
# In aeronautics, [[night flying restrictions]] may restrict aircraft operations over a defined period in the nighttime, to limit the disruption of [[aircraft noise]] on the sleep of nearby residents. Notable examples are the [[London]] airports of [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]], which operate under the [[Quota Count system]].
# In a few locations in the UK patrons of licensed premises may not enter after a "curfew" time. In [[Inverclyde]] for example this is currently set at 12:00 am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/news/greenock/articles/2010/02/26/397551-pub-and-club-curfew-extended|title=Pub and club curfew extended|work=Greenock Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
On 28 January 2011, and following the collapse of the police system, President [[Hosni Mubarak]] declared a country-wide military enforced curfew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/28/egypt-protests-mubarak-army-curfew | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Jack | last1=Shenker | first2=Peter | last2=Beaumont | first3=Sam | last3=Jones | title=Egypt (News),Middle East and North Africa (News) MENA,World news,Hosni Mubarak,Mohamed ElBaradei,Africa (News) | date=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was ignored by demonstrators who continued their sit-in in Tahrir Square. Concerned residents formed neighborhood vigilante groups to defend their communities against looters and the newly escaped prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/29/egypt-jail-break-700-prisoners-escape_n_815872.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Cara | last=Parks | title=Massive Egyptian Prison Break Frees 700 Inmates | date=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second anniversary of the revolution, January 2013, a wave of demonstrations swept the country against President [[Mohamed Morsi]] who declared a curfew in [[Port Said]], [[Ismaïlia]], and [[Suez]], three cities where deadly street clashes had occurred. In defiance, the locals took to the streets during the curfew,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/63539.aspx|title=Suez Canal residents defy President Morsi's curfew|work=ahram.org.eg}}&lt;/ref&gt; organizing football tournaments and street festivals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323375204578269700878491978|title=Egyptians Defy President's Curfew, as Unrest Spreads|author=Matt Bradley|date=29 January 2013|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibiting police and military forces from enforcing the curfew.

===Iceland===
Under [[Iceland|Iceland's]] Child Protection Act (no. 80/2002 Art. 92)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/2002080.html "Child Protection",
2002 no. 80 May 10th&lt;/ref&gt;, children aged 12 and under may not be outdoors after 20:00 (8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.) unless accompanied by an adult. Children aged 13 to 16 may not be outdoors after 22:00 (10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.), unless on their way home from a recognized event organized by a school, sports organization or youth club. During the period 1 May to 1 September, children may be outdoors for two hours longer.

Children and teenagers that break curfew are taken to the local police station and police officers inform their parents to get them. The age limits stated here shall be based upon year of birth, not date of birth. If a parent cannot be reached, the child or teenager is taken to a shelter.

===Sri Lanka===
In [[Sri Lanka]], the [[Sri Lanka Police]] are empowered to declare and enforce a ''Police Curfew'' in any [[police station|police area]] for any particular period to maintain the peace, law and order. Under the [[State_of_emergency#Sri_Lanka|emergency regulations]] of the ''Public Security Ordinance'', the President may declare a curfew over the whole or over any part of the country. Travel is restricted, during a curfew, to authorised persons such as police, armed forces personal and public officers. Civilians may gain a [[Curfew Pass]] from a police station to travel during a curfew.

===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] 2003 Anti-Social Behaviour Act created zones that allow police from 9 PM to 6 AM to hold and escort home unaccompanied minors under the age of 16, whether badly behaved or not. Although hailed as a success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/5405822.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - England - Wear - Late night youth curfew a success|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ruled in one particular case that the law did not give the police a power of arrest, and officers could not force someone to come with them. On appeal the court of appeal held that the act gave police powers to escort minors home only if they are involved in, or at risk from, actual or imminently anticipated bad behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/media/press/2006/court-judgment-on-governments-anti-yob-anti-child-policy.php|title=Court Judgment on Government’s ‘Anti-Yob’/ Anti-Child Policy|work=liberty-human-rights.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few towns in the United Kingdom, the [[curfew bell]] is still rung as a continuation of the medieval tradition where the bell used to be rung from the [[parish church]] to guide travelers safely towards a town or village as darkness fell, or when bad weather made it difficult to follow trackways and for the villagers to extinguish their lights and fires as a safety measure to combat accidental fires. Until 1100 it was against the law to burn any lights after the ringing of the curfew bell. In Morpeth, the curfew is rung each night at 8pm from [[Morpeth Clock Tower]]. In [[Chertsey]], it is rung at 8pm, from [[Michaelmas]] to [[Lady Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stpeterschertsey.org.uk/bells/curfew.htm|title=St. Peter's Shared Church Chertsey|work=stpeterschertsey.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short story concerning the Chertsey curfew, set in 1471, and entitled "[[Blanche Heriot]]. A legend of old [[Chertsey]] Church" was published by Albert Richard Smith in 1843, and formed a basis for the poem "[[Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight]]". At Castleton in the Peak District, the curfew is rung from Michaelmas to Shrove Tuesday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peaklandheritage.org.uk/index.asp?peakkey=31002121|title=peak district local history, customs, wildlife, transport - Peakland Heritage|work=peaklandheritage.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Wallingford in Oxfordshire, the curfew bell continues to be rung at 9pm rather than 8pm which is a one-hour extension granted by William The Conqueror as the Lord of the town was a Norman sympathiser. However, none of these curfew bells serve their original function.

===United States of America===

====Juvenile curfews====
Curfew law in the [[United States]] is usually a matter of [[local ordinance]] (mainly applied by a municipality or county), rather than federal law. However, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] guarantees certain rights, which have been applied to the states through the 14th Amendment. Hence, any curfew law may be overruled and struck down if, for example, it violates a juvenile's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st]], [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th]], [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] or [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] rights.
Nonetheless, curfews are set by state and local governments. They vary by state&lt;ref&gt;[http://411newyork.org/guide/2009/08/14/curfews-in-new-york/ Curfews in the State of New York]&lt;/ref&gt; and even by county or municipality. In some cities there are curfews for persons under the age of 18. American military curfews are a tool used by commanders at various installations to shape the behavior of soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url= http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/korea/curfew-put-in-place-for-all-u-s-troops-in-south-korea-1.157192
|title=Curfew put in place for all US troops in South Korea |publisher=Stars and Stripes|year=2011|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated purpose of such laws is generally to deter disorderly behavior and crime, while others can include to protect youth from victimization and to strengthen parental responsibility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecode360.com/14324463|title=Town of Myersville, MD Curfew|work=ecode360.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their effectiveness is subject to debate. Generally, curfews attempt to address [[vandalism]], [[shooting]]s, and [[property crime]]s, which are believed to happen mostly at night, but are less commonly used to address [[Legal drinking age|underage drinking]], [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]] and [[teenage pregnancy]]. Parents can be fined, [[criminal charge|charged]] or ordered to take parenting classes for willingly, or through insufficient control or supervision, permitting the child to violate the curfew. Many local curfew laws were enacted in the 1950s and 1960s to attack the "juvenile delinquent" problem of youth gangs. Most curfew exceptions include:
*accompanied by a parent or an adult appointed by the parent;
*going to or coming home from work, school, religious, or recreational activity;
*engaging in a lawful employment activity or;
*involved in an emergency;
Some cities make it illegal for a business owner, operator, or any employee to knowingly allow a minor to remain in the establishment during curfew hours. A business owner, operator, or any employee may be also subject to fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faribault.org/departments/police/curfews|title=Curfews » City of Faribault, MN|work=faribault.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509034013/http://www.faribault.org/departments/police/curfews|archivedate=2012-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 UC-Berkeley study looked at the 54 larger U.S. cities that enacted youth curfews between 1985 and 2002 and found that arrests of youths affected by curfew restrictions dropped almost 15% in the first year and approximately 10% in following years.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/juvenile-curfew-laws-arrests/|title="Impact of Juvenile Curfew Laws on Arrests of Youth and Adults" at Journalist's Resource.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all studies agree with the conclusion that youth curfew laws actually reduce crime, and many studies find no benefit or sometimes even the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;https://jjie.org/2013/10/14/op-ed-why-dont-youth-curfews-work/ OP-ED: Why Don’t Youth Curfews Work?, Mike Males | October 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/repealing-juvenile-curfew-laws-could-make-cities-safer/ 
Repealing juvenile curfew laws could make cities safer
Jennifer L. DoleacTuesday, December 29, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one 2016 systematic review of 12 studies on the matter found that the effect on crime is close to zero, and can perhaps even backfire somewhat.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/07/31/the-curfew-myth The Curfew Myth, Ivonne Roman&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also concerns about [[racial profiling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2013/03/new_orleans_curfew_data_93_per.html|title=New Orleans curfew data: 93 percent of curfew arrestees are black|work=NOLA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to concerns about racial profiling, [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] passed a limited curfew, which would permit police officers to arrest juveniles in situations that appear threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www6.montgomerycountymd.gov/content/pdf/curfew.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514002127/http://www6.montgomerycountymd.gov/content/pdf/curfew.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mall curfews====
Many malls in the United States have policies that prohibit minors under a specified age from entering the mall after specified times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://997now.cbslocal.com/2012/05/10/upscale-mall-enforces-teen-curfew-dress-code/|title=Upscale Mall Enforces Teen Curfew &amp; Dress Code|work=cbslocal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless they are accompanied by a parent or another adult or are working at the mall during curfew times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northparkcenter.com/Code-of-Conduct|title=Code of Conduct - NorthPark Center|work=northparkcenter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such policies are known as ''mall curfews.'' Malls that have policies prohibiting unaccompanied minors at any time are known as ''parental escort policies.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mallofamerica.com/guests/escorts|title=Parental Escort Policy|work=mallofamerica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Curfews for all====
States and municipalities in the United States have occasionally enacted curfews on the population at large, often as a result of severely [[inclement weather]] or [[political dissent|political unrest]]. Some such curfews require all citizens simply to refrain from driving. Others require all citizens to remain inside, with exceptions granted to those in important positions, such as [[elected official]]s, [[law enforcement]] personnel, [[first responder]]s, [[health care]] workers, and the [[mass media]].

In 2015, the city of [[Baltimore]] enacted a curfew on all citizens that lasted for five days and prohibited all citizens from going outdoors from 10 pm to 5 am with the exception of those traveling to or from work and those with medical emergencies. This was in response to the [[2015 Baltimore protests]].

However, unlike juvenile curfews, all-ages curfews have always been very limited in terms of both location and duration.  That is, they are temporary and restricted to very specific areas, and generally only implemented during states of emergency, then subsequently lifted or allowed to sunset.

===New Zealand===
Curfew laws do not exist in New Zealand and therefore cannot be legally enforced by Police.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13455">The '''Dakar Conference''' (also known as the '''Dakar Dialogue''' and the '''Dakar Initiative''') was a historic conference between members of the [[Institute for Democratic Alternatives in South Africa]] (IDASA) and the [[African National Congress]] (ANC). It was held in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] between 9 and 12 July 1987. The conference discussed topics such as strategies for bringing fundamental change in South Africa, national unity, structures of the government and the future of the economy in a free [[South Africa]]. The IDASA delegation from South Africa, participated in the conference in their private capacity and would later be condemned by the South African government for meeting a banned organization. The future indirect result of the conference was South African government talks with [[Nelson Mandela]] and his eventual meeting with [[P. W. Botha]] in 1989.

[[Frederik van Zyl Slabbert]], a member of the opposition resigned from the Progressive Federal Party and the South African parliament in January 1986, describing it as irrelevant and that he would explore other avenues of negotiations between white and black South African's.&lt;ref name="NYT10"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/21/world/south-africa-s-liberals-divided-and-dropping-out.html | title=South Africa's Liberals: Divided and Dropping Out | work=The New York Times | date=21 February 1988 | accessdate=18 August 2016 | author=Battersby, John D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. [[Alex Boraine]] would also leave with him. Van Zyl Slabbert and Boraine would the establish The Institute for Democratic Alternatives in South Africa (IDASA), a non-partisan organization that aimed to promote inclusive democracy in South Africa by talking to people of all races within and outside the country.&lt;ref name="Last"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=0RN1AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT201&amp;dq=breytenbach+dakar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=breytenbach%20dakar&amp;f=false | title=The Last Afrikaner Leaders: A Supreme Test of Power | publisher=University of Virginia Press | author=Giliomee, Hermann | year=2013 | location=Virginia | pages=448 | isbn=9780813934952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slabbert, in communication with [[Thabo Mbeki]], member of the ANC National Executive, discussed the change in attitude amongst some of the [[Afrikaner]] elite towards Afrikaner Nationalism and [[Apartheid]].&lt;ref name=Last/&gt; Out of these discussions and meetings, an idea was generated for a possible meeting between them and the ANC.&lt;ref name=Last/&gt; This would be a change from the opposition [[Liberalism in South Africa|White liberals]] attempting to force political change from within the parliamentary system, to the Afrikaner elite taking direct action in shaping the future of direction of South Africa.

Later in 1986, Slabbert and Breyten Breytenbach met on Gorée Island of Dakar in Senegal and decided that the city should be the location of the conference.&lt;ref name="UP01"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.letterkunde.up.ac.za/argief/46_2/03%20Giliomee%2003.pdf | title=True Confessions, End Papers and the Dakar conference: A review of the political arguments | publisher=University of Pretoria | accessdate=1 August 2016 | author=Giliomee, Hermann}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two then approached [[George Soros]] to help finance the conference, which he would do, but he was skeptical that the conference would achieve anything for South Africa.&lt;ref name=UP01/&gt; Breytenbach then approached [[Danielle Mitterrand]], the French president's wife who headed the France-Libertés Foundation and who was well acquainted with [[Abdou Diouf]], the Senegalese President, and asked her to intercede with him to allow the South African delegates to enter Senegal and ensure the security of the conference.&lt;ref name=UP01/&gt; The [[African Jurists' Association]] would also play a role in the conference's organisation.&lt;ref name="Switzer"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=bUvA7PHnCrUC&amp;pg=PA415&amp;dq=breytenbach+dakar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=breytenbach%20dakar&amp;f=false | title=South Africa's Resistance Press: Alternative Voices in the Last Generation Under Apartheid.

The IDASA delegation personally invited by Slabbert consisted of 61 delegates with at least half consisting of Afrikaner academics, teachers, journalists, artists, directors, writers and professionals and the group had Afrikaans speaking Coloureds, ten English-speaking businessmen and academics and three South African based German academics.&lt;ref name=UP01/&gt; The South African delegation attended in their private capacity and did not represent the organisations they worked for. The seventeen ANC delegates would be led by Thabo Mbeki in his capacity of ANC Director of Information and four other members of the ANCs National Executive Committee while the other twelve were made up of ANC members based in [[Zambia]], [[Scandinavia]], UK, Ireland, United States and West Africa.&lt;ref name="DISA01"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.disa.ukzn.ac.za/webpages/DC/resep87.4/resep87.4.pdf | title=Dakar Dialogue | publisher=University of KwaZulu-Natal | accessdate=31 July 2016 | author=Savage, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}

The IDASA delegation flew into Dakar from [[London]] and were met at the airport by the Senegalese Head of Protocol in the VIP lounge and then escorted by motorcycle riders to their hotel where the conference would take place and were met there by the ANC delegation.&lt;ref name=DISA01/&gt;{{rp|4}} During the conference, the delegates would attend receptions at Presidential Palace and the Minister of Educations residence. The conference began on 9 July and would end on 12 July.&lt;ref name=DISA01/&gt;{{rp|4}}

== Conference ==
The conference was opened by President Abdou Diouf and attended by his cabinet and members of the diplomatic community and then an address was given by Danielle Mitterrand.&lt;ref name=DISA01/&gt;{{rp|5}} The delegates would then return to their hotel and the conference venue.&lt;ref name=DISA01/&gt;{{rp|5}} Four major topics had been agreed upon and the delegates had submitted the papers prior to conference and had been viewed by the ANC and they would respond to them after their presentation.&lt;ref name=DISA01/&gt;{{rp|5}} The four major topics included, strategies for bringing fundamental change in South Africa, national unity, structures of the government and the future of the economy in a free South Africa.&lt;ref name=DISA01/&gt;{{rp|4}} Informal topics were also discussed and included the armed struggle, violence, negotiations, political [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism,]] a [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]], future of [[Afrikaans]] and its culture, a future economy, distributive justice and other topics.&lt;ref name=DISA01/&gt;{{rp|5}}

The delegates in their presentation expressed their concern about violence in South Africa and its impact on civilians while the ANC members outlined why they had begun an armed struggle when all other peaceful strategies to bring about racial policy change in South Africa had failed and that attacks on soft targets was not a policy and that control over its armed cadres in the country was not always possible.&lt;ref name=DISA01/&gt;{{rp|5}} It was clear to the delegates during the discussions that the ANC was prepared to negotiate with the government but that certain preconditions would have to be met which included the release of political prisoners and the unbanning of banned organisation's in the country.&lt;ref name=DISA01/&gt;{{rp|5}}

With regards to pluralism, the ANC expressed a commitment of political pluralism in a new South African political system and that racism and fascism would be outlawed in the political system.&lt;ref name=DISA01/&gt;{{rp|5}} It expressed a belief that the groups committed to the ending of Apartheid would in a new South Africa political system would split into its own organizations expressing their own ideas and beliefs.&lt;ref name=DISA01/&gt;{{rp|6}}

The ANC in the discussion concerning a Bill of Rights said it did not have a problem with it but would not guarantee privileges in such a bill. It expressed a reassurance that the Afrikaans language would be safeguarded as well as its cultural identity and that all people's cultural heritages should be protected.&lt;ref name=DISA01/&gt;{{rp|6}}

Concerning the future South African economy the ANC's policies were still governed by the [[Freedom Charter]] and that some form of nationalization would be required to redress the economic and wealth imbalances and that any nationalization would not occur instantly and consultation would take place between business and the future government.&lt;ref name=DISA01/&gt;{{rp|6}} Health housing and education were key areas that the ANC would be readdressing.&lt;ref name=DISA01/&gt;{{rp|6}}

At the conclusion of the conference, a declaration was released by the participants stating that a negotiated settlement in South Africa was preferred and that main obstacle was the South African government's unwillingness to negotiate, and the delegates concern about the level of uncontrolled violence in the country.&lt;ref name=Last/&gt; A ferry trip was then organized to the [[Gorée Island]] and they visited the [[Maison des Esclaves]] and its museum in remembrance to the Dutch slave trade in West Africa.&lt;ref name="Voel"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=8lr1FloqLZsC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=breytenbach+dakar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=breytenbach%20dakar&amp;f=false | title=Voëlvry: The Movement that Rocked South Africa | publisher=Zebra | author=Hopkins, Pat | year=2006 | pages=239 | isbn=9781770071209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] condemned the talk, worried about the legitimacy the conference gave to the ANC and the government controlled [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SABC) and Afrikaner newspapers were critical.&lt;ref name=NYT01/&gt; English newspapers were said to be critical and lukewarm to the conference.&lt;ref name=Voel/&gt; Government officials would express their opinion privately that they thought the conference would hinder the government's own initiates.&lt;ref name=NYT01/&gt;

[[File:Deaf culture intro.webm|thumb|Deaf culture Introduction ]]

'''Deaf culture''' is the set of social beliefs, behaviors, art, literary traditions, history, values, and shared institutions of communities that are influenced by [[deafness]] and which use [[sign language]]s as the main means of communication. When used as a cultural label especially within the culture, the word ''deaf'' is often written with a capital ''D'' and referred to as "big&amp;nbsp;D Deaf" in speech and sign. When used as a label for the [[Audiology|audiological]] condition, it is written with a lower case ''d''.&lt;ref name="padden2005"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Padden | first1 = Carol A. | last2 = Humphries | first2 = Tom (Tom L.) | title = Inside Deaf Culture | year = 2005 | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, MA|page = 1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2B4XWIFPgowC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;vq=Deaf | isbn = 978-0-674-01506-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bigD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deafness.about.com/cs/culturefeatures1/a/bigdorsmalld.htm|title=Deaf Culture - Big D Small D|date=9 February 2010|publisher=About.com|author=Jamie Berke|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl G. Croneberg]] coined the term of "Deaf Culture" and he was the first to discuss analogies between Deaf and hearing cultures in his appendices C/D of the 1965 Dictionary of American Sign Language.&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C.; Dorothy C. Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg. 1965. A dictionary of American sign languages on linguistic principles. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Deaf community tend to view [[Hearing loss|deafness]] as a difference in human experience rather than a [[disability]] or [[disease]].&lt;ref name="ladd2003"&gt;{{cite book | first=Paddy | last=Ladd | authorlink=Paddy Ladd | year=2003 | title=Understanding Deaf Culture: In Search of Deafhood | publisher=Multilingual Matters | isbn=978-1-85359-545-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7PRLjkES83oC | page = 502 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lane2011"&gt;{{cite book | first=Harlan L. | last=Lane |author2=Richard Pillard |author3=Ulf Hedberg | year=2011 | title=The People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-975929-3 | page = 269 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KySGdskgT9EC&amp;pg=PA1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many members take pride in their Deaf identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Deaf and Proud to Use Sign Language|url = http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=2719254&amp;page=1|website = ABC News|date = 2006-12-13|accessdate = 2015-08-31|first = Susan Donaldson|last = James|first2 = Grace|last2 = Huang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deaf people, in the sense of a community or culture, can then be seen as a [[minority group]], and therefore some who are a part of this community may feel misunderstood by those who don't know sign language. Another struggle that the Deaf community often faces is that educational institutions usually consist primarily of hearing people. Additionally, hearing family members may need to learn sign language in order for the deaf person to feel included and supported. Unlike some other cultures, a deaf person may join the community later in life, rather than needing to be born into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deafness in Society|last = Nash|first = Jeffrey E.|publisher = LexingtonBooks|year = 1981|isbn = |location = Toronto|pages = 100–102|last2 = Nash|first2 = Anedith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three views.webm|thumb|Three views on Deaf people]]
[[File:Cochlear-implant-external-part.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cochlear-implant-external-part.jpg|thumb|Cochlear Implant - A surgically implanted device used by Deaf and hard-of-hearing people to improve hearing.]]
There are several perspectives on deaf people and Deaf culture that shape their treatment and role in society. From a medical standpoint, many encourage Deaf children to undergo surgery. Especially in the past, the medical perspective discouraged the use of sign language because they believed it would distract from development of auditory and speech skills. From a social standpoint, Deaf individuals are welcomed to participate in society in the same manner as any other individual. This view discourages the idea that those who are deaf or [[Hearing loss|hard-of-hearing]] are sick and in need of a cure. The social view also encourages making accommodations for deaf people so that they can fully participate in society. Such accommodations include the use of interpreters or improved closed captioning systems. Many feel, however, that the social view fails to recognize the unique qualities of Deaf people and Deaf culture. They believe that this perspective asks Deaf people to fit and find their own way in a predominantly hearing society, instead of recognizing their own abilities and culture. Another perspective is referred to as the [[Cultural linguistics|cultural-linguistic]] view. Supporters of Deaf Culture state that this perspective appropriately recognizes Deaf people as a minority culture in the world with their own language and social norms. This standpoint is believed to promote Deaf people's right to collective space within society to pass on their language and culture to future generations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lane, Harlan L.; Richard Pillard; Ulf Hedberg (2011).

Being involved in the Deaf community and culturally identifying as Deaf has been shown to significantly contribute to positive self-esteem in Deaf individuals.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hamill, Alexis C., and Catherine H. Stein. “Culture and Empowerment in the Deaf Community:		 An Analysis of Internet Weblogs.” Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology,		 vol. 21, no. 5, 2011, pp. 388–406., doi:10.1002/casp.1081.&lt;/ref&gt; The community can provide support, easy social interaction, and "refuge from the grinding frustrations of the hearing world." Conversely, Deaf individuals who are not a part of the Deaf community are forced to conform to the hearing world, resulting in lower self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politics of Visual Language: Deafness, Language Choice, and Political Socialization|last=Roots|first=James|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes, lack of knowledge, and negative attitudes about Deafness cause widespread discrimination.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This often leads to a lower education and economic status for deaf people.[[File:Deaf community 1.webm|thumb|Deaf Community]]
The community may include hearing family members of deaf people and sign-language interpreters who identify with Deaf culture. It does not automatically include all people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.&lt;ref name="padden1988"&gt;{{cite book | first1=Carol | last1=Padden | first2=Tom | last2=Humphries | year=1988 | title=Deaf in America: Voices from a Culture | publisher=Harvard University Press | isbn=978-0-674-19423-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLdCuk0YekgC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA1 | page=134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As educator and [[American Sign Language]] interpreter Anna Mindess writes, "it is not the extent of hearing loss that defines a member of the deaf community but the individual's own sense of identity and resultant actions."&lt;ref name="mindess2006"&gt;{{cite book | first=Anna | last=Mindess | year=2006 | title=Reading Between the Signs: Intercultural Communication for Sign Language Interpreters | url=https://books.google.com/?id=dQk1lt0V9foC&amp;dq=Intercultural+Communication+for+Sign+Language+Interpreters&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn=978-1-931930-26-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with all social groups that a person chooses to belong to, a person is a member of the Deaf community if he/she "identifies him/herself as a member of the Deaf community, and other members accept that person as a part of the community."&lt;ref name="bakpad1978"&gt;{{cite book | first=Charlotte | last=Baker |author2=Carol Padden | year=1978 | title=American Sign Language: A look at its story, structure and community}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deaf culture is recognized under Article 30, Paragraph 4 of the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], which states that "Persons with disabilities shall be entitled, on an equal basis with others, to recognition and support of their specific cultural and linguistic identity, including sign languages and deaf culture."

==Terminology==

==="deaf" and "Deaf"===
In 1972, Professor James Woodward, co-director of the Centre for Sign Linguistics and Deaf Studies at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] since 2004, proposed a distinction between deafness and the Deaf culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=24 August 2010|accessdate=22 November 2013|title=James Woodward biography|url=http://deaf-dialogue.net/?p=1372|publisher=Deaf Dialogue|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203062602/http://deaf-dialogue.net/?p=1372|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested using ''[[deaf]]'' (written with a lower case ''d'') to refer to the audiological condition of deafness, and ''Deaf'' (written with an upper case ''D'') to refer to Deaf culture.&lt;ref name="padden2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ladd2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="padden1988" /&gt;
[[File:Deaf vs deaf.webm|thumb|"deaf" Vs. "Deaf"]]
A [[U.S. state]] regulation from the [[Colorado Department of Human Services]] defines "Deaf" (uppercase) as "A group of people, with varying hearing acuity, whose primary mode of communication is a visual language (predominantly American Sign Language (ASL) in the United States) and have a shared heritage and culture," and has a separate definition for "deaf" (lowercase).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/GenerateRulePdf.do?ruleVersionId=3504|title = RULE MANUAL 27 COLORADO COMMISSION FOR THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING|date = May 1, 2010|accessdate = September 26, 2015|publisher = Colorado Secretary of State|page = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This convention has been widely adopted within the culture and the scholarly literature in English,&lt;ref name="bigD" /&gt; and to some extent in other languages. The two terms are also widely used to refer to distinct but partially overlapping groups of people: deaf people (those with significant hearing loss) vs. Deaf people (those who identify with Deaf culture and use a sign language as a primary means of communication). Not everyone makes this distinction, however; some point out that there are many ways to be "deaf" and a simple two-way distinction is too confining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.verywell.com/deaf-culture-big-d-small-d-1046233|title='Big D' and 'Small d' in the Deaf Community|work=Verywell Health|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:First person rejected.webm|thumb|"People-first" Language rejected]]

==="People-first" language rejected===
In Deaf culture, [[person-first language]] (i.e., "Person who is deaf", "person who is hard of hearing") has long been rejected since being culturally Deaf is seen as a source of positive identity and pride.&lt;ref name="Lum-2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lum |first=Doman |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aMqGhHCxXUYC&amp;pg=PA441 |title=Culturally Competent Practice: A Framework for Understanding |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=441 |isbn=9780840034434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Deaf culture uses Deaf-first language: "Deaf person" or "hard-of-hearing person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallaudet.edu/clerc_center/information_and_resources/info_to_go/educate_children_(3_to_21)/resources_for_mainstream_programs/terminology.html |title=Terminology Describing Deaf Individuals |publisher=Gallaudet University |accessdate=June 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605054809/http://www.gallaudet.edu/Clerc_Center/Information_and_Resources/Info_to_Go/Educate_Children_%283_to_21%29/Resources_for_Mainstream_Programs/Terminology.html |archive-date=June 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Capital D -Deaf is as stated prior, is referred to as a student who first identifies as that. Lower case d- deaf is where a person has hearing loss. Typically, those that consider themselves Deaf, first and foremost prior to any other identity.

==="Hearing-impaired" and "hard of hearing"===
[[File:Hearing impairment.webm|thumb|"Hearing-impaired" and "hard of hearing"]]
Hearing people may use the term ''[[Hearing loss|hearing-impaired]]'', perhaps thinking it is more polite than "deaf", but Deaf people tend to reject it, for a variety of reasons. It is more likely to be used for people with a mild or moderate hearing loss or for people who have acquired deafness in adulthood rather than by those who have grown up Deaf. By contrast, those who identify with the [[Deaf rights movement|Deaf culture movement]] typically reject the label hearing-''impaired'' and other labels that imply that deafness is a pathological condition,&lt;ref name="nad"&gt;{{cite web |title=Community and Culture – Frequently Asked Questions – Question – What is wrong with the use of these terms 'deaf-mute,' 'deaf and dumb,' or 'hearing-impaired'? |website=National Association of the Deaf |url=http://nad.org/issues/american-sign-language/community-and-culture-faq |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227171131/http://nad.org/issues/american-sign-language/community-and-culture-faq |archive-date=2015-12-27 |access-date=2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; viewing it instead as a focus of pride.&lt;ref name="ladd2003" /&gt; Further, the term focuses entirely on the physical condition of deafness, while ignoring the linguistic and cultural distinction between those who sign and identify with Deaf culture, and those who do not.

The term "hard of hearing" is preferred over "hearing-impaired" within the American Deaf community and accepted as a neutral term without negative or pathological connotations, with no implication about age of onset. It generally refers to people who depend primarily on a spoken language for communication or who have mild or moderate hearing loss. An ASL term {{Smallcaps|'''hard-of-hearing'''}} exists and is roughly equivalent to the English term

Various terms once used to refer to the deaf are no longer used and may be viewed either as out-of-date, or an insult, such as [[deaf-mute]], or [[deaf and dumb]].&lt;ref name="nad" /&gt; Formerly these terms were neutral, or at least, accepted, as can be seen by nicknames such as baseball player [[Dummy Hoy]], or the former names of educational institutions, since renamed, such as [[Pennsylvania School for the Deaf]] (formerly [[Pennsylvania Institute for the Deaf and Dumb]]), [[Gallaudet University]] (formerly '''National Deaf-Mute College''').

Deaf-mute is a literal translation of the French ''sourd-muet'' which was already in use in France in the 19th century, in the [[Charles-Michel de l'Épée#Published works|works]] of the founder of the deaf school in Paris, as well as in the name of the school, the ''[[Institution Nationale des Sourds-Muets à Paris]]''.  Since some Deaf people can also speak, the term "deaf-mute" is not accurate. The word "dumb" had meant "speechless" for centuries in English, before it gained the sense of "stupid" as a secondary meaning in the 19th century, but since "stupid" has now become the primary meaning, even though the term is still widely understood in the secondary meaning in the particular expression, the term is now unsuitable to refer to Deaf people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Grammarphobia Blog – Speaking of dumb |last1=O'Conner |first1= Patricia |last2=Kellerman |first2=Stewart |date=July 3, 2014 |url=http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2014/07/dumb.html |access-date=2015-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905080610/http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2014/07/dumb.html |archive-date=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition==

Historically, Deaf culture has often been acquired within schools for Deaf students and within Deaf social clubs, both of which unite deaf people into communities with which they can identify.&lt;ref name="ladd2003" /&gt; Becoming Deaf culturally can occur at different times for different people, depending on the circumstances of one's life. A small proportion of deaf individuals acquire sign language and Deaf culture in infancy from Deaf parents, others acquire it through attendance at schools, and yet others may not be exposed to sign language and Deaf culture until college or a time after that.&lt;ref name="mindess2006" /&gt;

Although up to fifty percent of deafness has genetic causes, fewer than five percent of deaf people have a deaf parent,&lt;ref name="Mitchell2004"&gt;Mitchell, Ross E. &amp; Karchmer, Michael A. (2004) Chasing the mythical ten percent: Parental hearing status of deaf and hard of hearing students in the United States. ''[[Sign Language Studies]]'' 4:2, 138–163.&lt;/ref&gt; so Deaf communities are unusual among cultural groups in that most members do not acquire their cultural identities from parents.&lt;ref name="bauman2008"&gt;{{cite book|first=Dirksen|last=Bauman|year=2008|title=Open your eyes: Deaf studies talking|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-4619-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversity within Deaf culture===
Educator and [[ASL]] interpreter Anna Mindess notes that there is "not just one homogeneous deaf culture".&lt;ref name="mindess2006" /&gt; There are many distinct Deaf communities around the world, which communicate using different [[sign languages]] and exhibit different cultural norms. Deaf identity also intersects with other kinds of [[cultural identity]]. Deaf culture intersects with nationality, education, race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, and other identity markers, leading to a culture that is at once quite small and also tremendously diverse.  The extent to which people identify primarily with their deaf identity rather than their membership in other intersecting cultural groups also varies. Mindess notes a 1989 study, which found that "87 percent of black deaf people polled identified with their black culture first".&lt;ref name="mindess2006" /&gt;

== Education ==
In comparison to the general public, deaf people have lower levels of educational achievement.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Christiansen, John B. “Sociological Implications of Hearing Loss.” ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'', vol. 630, no. 1 Genetics of H, 1991, pp. 230–235.,doi:10.1111/j.1749-6632.1991.tb19592.x.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates in deaf education believe that an improved recognition of [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) as an official language would improve education, as well as economic status. Some argue that by improving the recognition of ASL, better access to school materials, deaf teachers, interpreters, and video-telephone communication would take place. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Padden, Carol, and Tom Humphries. Deaf in America: Voices from a Culture. Harvard University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deaf culture is prevalent in schools for the deaf. There are [[K–12|k-12 schools]] for the deaf throughout the world and the United States, however higher education specifically for the deaf is more limited.

=== The "Big Three" ===
[[File:Chapel_Hall,_Gallaudet_University.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chapel_Hall,_Gallaudet_University.jpg|thumb|Gallaudet University's Chapel Hall]]
Three colleges within the United States that are often identified as the best providers of higher education for deaf people. Referred to often as the "Big Three," these include [[California State University, Northridge|California State University at Northridge]] (CSUN), National Technical Institute for the Deaf (part of [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]), and [[Gallaudet University]]. Gallaudet University is the first and only liberal-arts college for deaf students in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gallaudet.edu/about/who-we-are|title=Who We Are|last=|first=|date=|website=Gallaudet University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Colleges for the Deaf ===
Although the United States leads in higher education opportunities for the deaf, there are colleges across the globe. In Australia, there is the [[Victorian College for the Deaf]]. Brazil has several institutions, including Instituto Santa Tersinha and Escola para Crianças Surdas Rio Branco. China's deaf universities include [[Beijing Union University]], Special Education College of Beijing University, and [[Zhengzhou University|Zhongzhou University]]. Other notable universities for the deaf across the globe include Finland School for the Deaf (Finland), [[Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris]] (France), Berlin School for the Deaf (Germany), and Northwest Secondary School for the Deaf (South Africa.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deafeducationworldwide.weebly.com/deaf-education-programs-around-the-world.html|title=Deaf Education Programs around the World|last=Tay|first=Phoebe|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Sign languages===
Members of Deaf cultures communicate via [[sign language]]s. There are over 200 distinct sign languages in the world. These include 114 sign languages listed in the Ethnologue database and 157 more sign languages, systems, and dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Harrington|first = Thomas|title = Sign language of the world by name|url = http://libguides.gallaudet.edu/content.php?pid=114804&amp;sid=991940|publisher = Galllaudet University Library|accessdate = 24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Thomas. "Sign language of the world by name." n. page. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] are both predominantly [[English language|English]] speaking, the predominant signed languages used in these countries differ markedly. Due to the origins of deaf education in the United States, [[American Sign Language]] is most closely related to [[French Sign Language]].
Sign language is just one part of deaf culture. Deaf identity is also constructed around specific beliefs, values and art.

===Values and beliefs===
* A positive attitude towards deafness is typical in Deaf cultural groups. Deafness is not generally considered a condition that needs to be fixed.&lt;ref name="mindess2006" /&gt; 
* The term "Deaf Gain" is used by Deaf people, to re-frame the deafness to a gain to show how Deaf people do contribute in this world.
* The use of a sign language is central to Deaf cultural identity. Oralist approaches to educating deaf children thereby pose a threat to the continued existence of Deaf culture. Some members of Deaf communities may also oppose technological innovations like [[cochlear implant]]s for the same reason.
* Culturally, Deaf people value the use of natural sign languages that exhibit their own grammatical conventions, such as [[American Sign Language]] and [[British Sign Language]], over signed versions of English or other oral languages. Spoken English, written English and [[Signing Exact English|signed English]] are three different symbolic systems for expressing the same language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deaf Heritage–A Narrative History of Deaf America|last = Gannon|first = Jack R|publisher = National Association of the Deaf|year = 1981|isbn = 978-0-913072-38-7|location = Silver Spring, MD|pages = 378}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deaf communities strongly oppose discrimination against deaf people.
* Deaf culture in the United States tends to be collectivist rather than individualist; culturally Deaf people value the group.&lt;ref name="mindess2006" /&gt;

===Behavioral patterns===
* Culturally Deaf people have rules of etiquette for getting attention, walking through signed conversations, leave-taking, and otherwise politely negotiating a signing environment.
* Deaf people also keep each other informed of what is going on in one's environment. It is common to provide detailed information when leaving early or arriving late; withholding such information may be considered rude.&lt;ref name="mindess2006" /&gt;
* Deaf people may be more direct or blunt than their hearing counterparts.&lt;ref name="mindess2006" /&gt;
* When giving introductions, Deaf people typically try to find common ground; since the Deaf community is relatively small, Deaf people usually know some other Deaf people in common.  "The search for connections is the search for connectedness."&lt;ref name="mindess2006" /&gt;
* Deaf people may also consider time differently. Showing up early to large-scale events, such as lectures, is typical. This may be motivated by the need to get a seat that provides the best visual clarity for the Deaf person.

===Reliance on technology===
*Deaf individuals rely on technology for communication significantly. In the United States, [[video relay service]]s and an array of freestanding and software-driven video phones are often used by deaf people to conduct telephonic communication with hearing and deaf businesses, family and friends. Devices such as the teletype (known as a TTY, an electronic device used for communication over a telephone line) are far less common, but are used by some deaf people who are without access to high-speed Internet or have a preference for these methods for their telephonic communication.
*Technology is even important in face-to-face social situations. For example, when deaf people meet a hearing person who does not know sign language, they often communicate via the notepad on their cell phones. Here, technology takes the place of a human sense, allowing deaf individuals to successfully communicate with different cultures.
*Social media tends to be of great importance to deaf individuals. Networking sites allow deaf people to find each other and to remain in contact. Many deaf people have deaf friends throughout the entire country that they met or maintain contact with through online communities.  Because the deaf community is so small, for many deaf people, the stigma of meeting others online does not exist.
*Closed Captioning must be available on a television in order for a deaf person to fully appreciate the audio portion of the broadcast. Conflicts arise when establishments such as restaurants, airlines, or fitness centers fail to accommodate deaf people by turning on Closed Captioning. Movie theaters are increasingly compliant with providing visual access to first-run movies through stand-alone devices, glasses and open caption technology which allow deaf people to attend movies as they are released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/05/12/183218751/new-closed-captioning-glasses-help-deaf-go-out-to-the-movies|title = New Closed-Captioning Glasses Help Deaf Go Out to the Movies : All Tech Considered|publisher = NPR|accessdate = 2015-04-12|date = May 12, 2013|last = Rood|first = Rachel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Alert systems such as fire alarms and alarm clocks must appeal to different senses in order for a deaf individual to notice the alert. Objects such as vibrating pillows and flashing lights often take the place of the noise-based alarms.
*Lack of understanding about technological accessibility for the deaf causes conflict and injustice for the deaf community. For example, a significant number of deaf individuals in the UK admit that they are dissatisfied with their banks because of their heavy reliance on telephone banking and lack of assistance to deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/news-and-events/all-regions/press-releases/banks-face-massive-payouts-to-deaf-customers.aspx|title = Banks face massive payouts to deaf customers|publisher = Action on Hearing Loss / RNID|date = 2012-02-21|accessdate = 2015-04-12|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130604102110/http://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/news-and-events/all-regions/press-releases/banks-face-massive-payouts-to-deaf-customers.aspx?jse=1|archivedate = 2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Architecture that is conducive to signed communication minimizes visual obstructions and may include such things as automatic sliding doors to free up the hands for continuous conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Tsymbal |first=Karina |year=2010 |title=Deaf Space and the Visual World – Buildings That Speak: An Elementary School For The Deaf |hdl=1903/11295 |publisher=University of Maryland |type=MArch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary traditions and the arts===
{{main|American Sign Language literature}}
A strong tradition of poetry and storytelling exists in American Sign Language and other sign languages. Some prominent performers in the United States include [[Clayton Valli]], [[Ben Bahan]], [[Ella Mae Lentz]], Manny Hernandez, C.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;Jones, Debbie Rennie, Patrick Graybill, Peter Cook, and many others.  Their works are now increasingly available on video.&lt;ref name="bauman2006"&gt;{{cite book | first=Dirksen | last=Bauman | year=2006 | title=Signing the Body Poetic: Essays in American Sign Language Literature | publisher=University of California Press | editors= Jennifer Nelson and Heidi Rose | isbn=978-0-520-22975-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Literacy and arts 3.webm|thumb|Literacy Traditions and Arts]]
Culturally Deaf people have also represented themselves in the dominant written languages of their nations.&lt;ref name="krentz2000"&gt;{{cite book | first=Christopher | last=Krentz | year=2000 | title=A Mighty Change: An Anthology of Deaf American Writing 1816–1864 | publisher=Gallaudet University Press | isbn=978-1-56368-101-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deaf artists such as [[Betty G. Miller]] and [[Chuck Baird]] have produced visual artwork that conveys a Deaf worldview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sonnenstrahl |first=Deborah |year=2002 |title=Deaf Artists in America: Colonial to Contemporary |publisher=DawnSignPress |isbn=978-1-58121-050-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas Tilden]] was a famous Deaf sculptor who produced many different sculptures in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Douglas Tilden facts and information |publisher=Deafness.answers.com |url=http://www.deafness.answers.com/celebrities/douglas-tilden-facts-and-information |accessdate=2015-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404104124/http://deafness.answers.com/celebrities/douglas-tilden-facts-and-information |archivedate=2015-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Deaf artists belong to an art movement called [[De'VIA]], which stands for Deaf View Image Art.

Organizations such as the [[Deaf Professional Arts Network]] or D-PAN are dedicated to promoting professional development and access to the entertainment, visual and media arts fields for individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Sean-Forbes.html|title=''Ability Magazine: Sean Forbes&amp;nbsp;– Not Hard to Hear"'' (2011)|publisher=Abilitymagazine.com|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daily Moth was established by Alex Abenchuchan in 2017 to make the news accessible for Deaf ASL users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailymoth.com/|title=thedailymoth|website=thedailymoth|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===History===
{{For|detailed deaf history | Deaf history}}
In the United States, the Cobbs School, a deaf school in Virginia, was established in 1815.  This school lasted only one and half years due to financial setbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/122715372|title=The deaf history reader|date=2007|publisher=Gallaudet University Press|others=Van Cleve, John V.|isbn=9781563683596|location=Washington, DC|oclc=122715372}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Deaf Community recounts the story of [[Laurent Clerc]], a deaf educator, coming to the United States from [[France]] in 1817 to help found the first permanent school for deaf children in the country now named American School for the Deaf in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="krentz2000" /&gt; American School is the first official school for the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/weta/throughdeafeyes/deaflife/first_school.html|title=Through Deaf Eyes . Deaf Life . The First Permanent School {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Another well-known event is the 1880 [[Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf]] in Milan, Italy, where hearing educators voted to embrace oral education and remove sign language from the classroom.&lt;ref name="baynton1996"&gt;{{cite book | first=Douglas | last=Baynton | year=1996 | title=Forbidden Signs: American Culture and the Campaign against Sign Language | publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn=978-0-226-03964-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effort resulted in strong opposition within deaf cultures today to the [[oralism|oralist]] method of teaching deaf children to speak and [[lip reading|lip read]] with limited or no use of sign language in the classroom. The method is intended to make it easier for Deaf children to integrate into hearing communities, but the benefits of learning in such an environment are disputed. The use of [[sign language]] is central to Deaf [[Cultural identity|identity]], and attempts to limit its use are viewed as an attack.

===Shared institutions===
[[File:ArtClassStateSchooloftheDeafDelavanWisconsin.jpg|thumb|right|Women's art class at State School of the Deaf, Delavan, Wisconsin, c. 1880]]
Deaf culture revolves around such institutions as residential schools for deaf students, universities for deaf students (including [[Gallaudet University]], [[South West Collegiate Institute for the Deaf]], and the [[National Technical Institute for the Deaf]]), deaf clubs, deaf athletic leagues, communal homes (such as The Home for Aged and Infirm Deaf-Mutes, founded by [[Jane Middleton]], in New York City), deaf social organizations (such as the Deaf Professional Happy Hour), deaf religious groups, deaf theaters, and an array of conferences and festivals, such as the Deaf Way II Conference and Festival and the [[World Federation of the Deaf]] conferences.

Deaf clubs, popular in the 1940s and 1950s, were also an important part of deaf culture. During this time there were very few places that the deaf could call their own– places run by deaf people for deaf people. Deaf clubs were the solution to this need. Money was made by selling alcohol and hosting card games. Sometimes these ventures were so successful that the building used by the club was able to be purchased. However, the main attraction of these clubs was that they provided a place that deaf people could go to be around other deaf people, sometimes sharing stories, hosting parties, comedians, and plays. Many of today's common ABC stories were first seen at deaf clubs. The clubs were found in all of the major cities, New York City being home to at least 12. These clubs were an important break from their usually solitary day spent at factory jobs.&lt;ref name=bauman2008 /&gt;

In the 1960s, deaf clubs began their quick and drastic decline. Today there are only a few spread-out deaf clubs found in the United States and their attendance is commonly small with a tendency to the elderly. This sudden decline is often attributed to the rise of technology like the TTY and [[closed captioning]] for personal TVs. With other options available for entertainment and communication, the need for deaf clubs grew smaller. It was no longer the only option for getting in touch with other members of the deaf community.&lt;ref name=bauman2008 /&gt;

However, others attribute the decline of deaf clubs to the end of [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] and a change in the job market. During WWII there was high demand for factory laborers and a promise of high pay. Many deaf Americans left their homes to move to bigger cities with the hope of obtaining a factory job. This huge influx of workers into new cities created the need for deaf clubs. When World War&amp;nbsp;II ended and the civil rights movement progressed, the federal government started offering more jobs to deaf men and women. People began switching from manufacturing jobs to service jobs, moving away from solitary work with set hours. Today, deaf clubs are rare, but deaf advocacy centers and other deaf organizations have become widespread and popular.&lt;ref name=bauman2008 /&gt;

====Deaf African-American institutions====
The [[National Black Deaf Advocates]] was established in 1982 "to promote the leadership development, economic and educational opportunities, social equality, and to safeguard the general health and welfare of Black deaf and hard-of-hearing people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nbda.org/content/about-us|title = About Us|website = National Black Deaf Advocates|accessdate = 2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deaf LGBT institutions====
The Rainbow Alliance of the Deaf is a nonprofit established in 1977 to, "establish and maintain a society of Deaf [[GLBT]] to encourage and promote the educational, economical, and social welfare; to foster fellowship; to defend our rights; and advance our interests as Deaf GLBT citizens concerning social justice; to build up an organization in which all worthy members may participate in the discussion of practical problems and solutions related to their social welfare.

There are deaf churches (where sign language is the main language), deaf synagogues, deaf Jewish community centers, and the [[Hebrew Seminary of the Deaf]] in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hebrewseminary.org |title=Hebrew Seminary – A Rabbinical School for Deaf and Hearing |accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LwxzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PR64 |chapter=Judaism |title = Encyclopedia of Disability Volume 5 |pages=997–998 |publisher=Sage Publications |accessdate = 2015-04-12|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0-7619-2565-1|editor-last = Albrecht|editor-first = Gary L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohsoez.com/churches/churchtitle.htm |title=Churches for Deaf |publisher=Ohsoez.com |accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=DeFiglio |first=Pam |title=Hebrew Seminary of the Deaf |work=Patch |url=http://skokie.patch.com/listings/hebrew-seminary-of-the-deaf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911205820/http://skokie.patch.com/listings/hebrew-seminary-of-the-deaf |archivedate=2013-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 [[Conservative Judaism|the Conservative Movement]] unanimously passed the rabbinic responsa, "The Status of the Heresh [one who is deaf] and of Sign Language," by the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] (CJLS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jwi.org/page.aspx?pid=3312#sthash.YCGDTeU8.43imcFtO.dpbs |title=Hearing the Needs of the Jewish Deaf |last=Tomchin |first=Susan |date=April 2012 |journal=Jewish Women International |access-date=September 26, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928060733/http://www.jwi.org/page.aspx?pid=3312 |archivedate=September 28, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This responsa declared that, among other things, "The Committee on Jewish Law and Standards rules that the deaf who communicate via sign language and do not speak are no longer to be considered mentally incapacitated. Jews who are deaf are responsible for observing [[mitzvot]]. Our communities, synagogues, schools, and camps must strive to be welcoming and accessible, and inclusive. Sign language may be used in matters of personal status and may be used in rituals. A deaf person called to the Torah who does not speak may recite the berakhot via sign language. A deaf person may serve as a [[hazzan|shaliah tzibbur]] in sign language in a [[minyan]] whose medium of communication is sign language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://deafnetwork.com/wordpress/blog/2011/06/20/jdrc-salutes-conservative-judaisms-ruling-to-include-deaf-jews-as-equals/|title = JDRC Salutes Conservative Judaism's Ruling to Include Deaf Jews as Equals &amp;#124; Deaf Network of Texas|publisher = Deafnetwork.com|date = 2011-06-20|accessdate = 2015-04-12|last = Laird|first = Grant, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libraries and the Deaf community===
{{Main|Libraries and the Deaf community}}

Deaf people at the library have the same needs as other library patrons, but they often have more difficulty accessing materials and services. Over the last few decades, libraries in the United States have begun to implement services and collections for Deaf patrons and are working harder every year to make more of their collections, services, their communities, and even the world more accessible. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The [[American Library Association]] considers disabled people, including the Deaf, as a minority that is often overlooked by library staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ascla/asclaissues/libraryservices |title=Library Services for People with Disabilities Policy &amp;#124; Association of Specialized &amp; Cooperative Library Agencies (ASCLA) |publisher=Ala.org |date=2001-01-16 |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the last few decades, libraries across the United States have made improvements in library accessibility in general and to the Deaf community specifically.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

One of the first activists in the library community working toward accessibility for the Deaf was [[Alice Hagemeyer]]. When disabled communities began demanding equality in the 1970s, Hagemeyer decided to go back to school for her master's degree in library science. While she was studying there, she realized that there was not very much information about the Deaf community at her library or at the libraries of any of her classmates. She soon became an activist for Deaf awareness at her library, and she became the first "Librarian for the Deaf Community" from any public library in the nation. Hagemeyer also constructed a manual of resources for Deaf people and those associated with them called The Red Notebook. This notebook is now an online resource, which is available at the website of the Friends of Libraries for Deaf Action.

IFLA Conference Proceedings, 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian librarian Karen McQuigg states that "even ten years ago, when I was involved in a project looking at what public libraries could offer the deaf, it seemed as if the gap between the requirements of this group and what public libraries could offer was too great for public libraries to be able to serve them effectively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = McQuigg|date = August 2003|title = Are the deaf a disabled group, or a linguistic minority? Issues for librarians in Victoria's public libraries|journal = Australian Library Journal|volume = 52 |issue = 4|url = http://alia.org.au/publishing/alj/52.4/full.text/mcquigg.html|first = Karen|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040531090722/http://www.alia.org.au/publishing/alj/52.4/full.text/mcquigg.html|archive-date = May 31, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a dearth of information for or about the Deaf community available in libraries across the nation and around the globe.

New guidelines from library organizations such as [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) and the ALA were written in order to help libraries make their information more accessible to people with disabilities, and in some cases, specifically the Deaf community. IFLA's ''Guidelines for Library Services to Deaf People'' is one such set of guidelines, and it was published to inform libraries of the services that should be provided for Deaf patrons. Most of the guidelines pertain to ensuring that Deaf patrons have equal access to all available library services. Other guidelines include training library staff to provide services for the Deaf community, availability of text telephones or TTYs not only to assist patrons with reference questions but also for making outside calls, using the most recent technology in order to communicate more effectively with Deaf patrons, including closed captioning services for any television services, and developing a collection that would interest the members of the Deaf community.&lt;ref&gt;Day, J. M. (2000). Guidelines for library services to deaf people (Report no. 62). The Hague: International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, library services have begun to evolve in order to accommodate the needs and desires of local Deaf communities. At the Queens Borough Public Library (QBPL) in New York, the staff implemented new and innovative ideas in order to involve the community and library staff with the Deaf people in their community. The QBPL hired a deaf librarian, Lori Stambler, to train the library staff about Deaf culture, to teach sign language classes for family members and people who are involved with deaf people, and to teach literacy classes for Deaf patrons. In working with the library, Stambler was able to help the community reach out to its deaf neighbors, and helped other deaf people become more active in their outside community.&lt;ref&gt;Hollander, P. (1995). Deaf-advocacy at Queens Borough PL. American Libraries, 26(6), 560–562.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deaf libraries===
The library at [[Gallaudet University]], the only Deaf liberal arts university in the United States, was founded in 1876. The library's collection has grown from a small number of reference books to the world's largest collection of deaf-related materials with over 234,000 books and thousands of other materials in different formats. The collection is so large that the library had to create a hybrid classification system based on the [[Dewey decimal system|Dewey Decimal Classification System]] in order to make cataloging and location within the library much easier for both library staff and users. The library also houses the university's archives, which holds some of the oldest deaf-related books and documents in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, T.R. (1998). The Deaf collection at the Gallaudet University Library. Education Libraries, 22(3), 5–12. {{doi|10.26443/el.v22i3.131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nashville, Tennessee, Sandy Cohen manages the Library Services for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (LSDHH). The program was created in 1979 in response to information accessibility issues for the Deaf in the Nashville area. Originally, the only service provided was the news via a teletypewriter or TTY, but today, the program has expanded to serving the entire state of Tennessee by providing all different types of information and material on deafness, Deaf culture, and information for family members of Deaf people, as well as a historical and reference collection.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, S. (2006). Have you heard about the Library Services for the Deaf &amp; Hard of Hearing? Tennessee Libraries, 56(1), 51–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Defensive democracy''' is the philosophy that members of a democratic society believe it necessary to limit some rights and freedoms, in order to protect the institutions of the democracy.

==Examples==
===Israel===
Israel implemented the principle of defensive democracy, the [[Basic Law: The Knesset|Basic Law of the Knesset]] (Section 7A) which determined that "candidate lists would not participate in elections if its goals or actions, expressly or by implication, would deny the existence of the state of Israel as a Jewish state or deny the democratic character of the state of Israel."

Various [[political science]] researchers{{Who|date=June 2012}} have perceived Israel as a [[democracy]] defending itself mainly from social and security constraints with which the state of Israel has been dealing since its creation. During the first three decades of its existence, the state of Israel was completely surrounded by countries that did not recognize Israel's existence as legitimate. Through the years, concerns have been raised from within the [[Israeli Jews|Jewish majority in Israel]] that the [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab minority within the country]], who consider themselves part of the [[Arab world]], would cooperate with the neighboring countries in their [[Arab–Israeli conflict|struggle against Israel]]. This situation has often raised the issue of a self-defensive democracy on the agenda in Israel.

During the 1980s, the issue was heavily discussed in a different context – for the first time in Israel's history, an extreme right-wing Jewish party (the [[Kach Party]]), who rejected the state's democratic character and the rights of the Arab minority within the country, won representation to the [[Knesset|Israeli parliament]] in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984 elections to the Knesset]]. As a result, Israel's Supreme Court outlawed the party and did not allow it to run again in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1988|1988 elections]] on the basis that the party advocates [[racism]].

===Europe===
Ten countries in Europe have outlawed [[Holocaust denial]]: [[France]] ([[Loi Gayssot]]), [[Belgium]] ([[Belgian Holocaust denial law]]), [[Switzerland]] (article 261bis of the Penal Code), [[Germany]] (§ 130 (3) of the penal code), [[Austria]] (article 3h Verbotsgesetz 1947), [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] (article 55 of the law creating the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] 1998).

Germany maintains a domestic intelligence service, the [[Verfassungsschutz]], whose main purpose is to investigate parties which may violate the constitutional bans on working to end the democratic nature of the state (in particular far-right and Communist parties).

===[[Republic of Korea]] (South Korea)===
Learning from legislation of West Germany, National Assembly of Second Republic inserted Defensive Democracy in their Constitution in 1960. After that, Now in Sixth Republic, it remains in Constitution (§8(4) — esp. defensive democracy to prevent illegal parties) and has some procedures in other laws. The [[Constitutional Court of Korea]] is in charge of deciding if a party is illegal and therefore should be dissolved.

For the first time since the Constitutional Court of Korea was created, on November 2013, the Justice Ministry of Korea petitioned the Constitutional Court to dissolve the [[Unified Progressive Party]], citing its pro-North Korean activities (see [[2013 South Korean sabotage plot]]). On 19 December 2014, the Court ruled 8-1 that the Unified Progressive Party be dissolved. This ruling was quite controversial in South Korea.

===[[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) ===
[[Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China|The Fifth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] clearly states that any political party whose purpose or behaviour threatens the existence of the Republic of China or constitutional order of [[liberal democracy]] is unconstitutional, and the [[Judicial Yuan#Justices of the Constitutional Court|Constitutional Court]] can dissolve it.

The '''Federation of Damanhur''', often called simply '''Damanhur''', is a commune, [[ecovillage]], and spiritual community situated in the [[Piedmont]] region of northern [[Italy]] about {{convert|50|km|mi}} north of the city of [[Turin]]. It is located in the foothills of the [[Alps]] in the [[Chiusella Valley]], bordering on the Gran Paradiso National Park. The community has its own constitution and currency, the ''Credito''.

Damanhur is named after the [[Egypt]]ian city of [[Damanhur]] which was the site of a temple dedicated to [[Horus]].

It  was founded in 1975 by [[Oberto Airaudi]] with around 24 followers, and by 2000 the number had grown to 800. The group holds a mix of [[New Age]] and  [[neopagan]] beliefs. They gained fame in 1992 through the disclosure of their secret excavation of an extensive underground temple, the [[Temples of Humankind]], which was begun in 1978 under complete secrecy. The Italian authorities ordered construction work to stop because it had been constructed without planning approval, although artwork could continue. Retroactive permission was subsequently granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=495538&amp;in_page_id=1811|title=Eighth wonder of the world? The stunning temples secretly carved out below ground by 'paranormal' eccentric|accessdate=2007-11-24|author=Courteney, Hazel|date=2007-11-22  |publisher=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damanhur's supporters claim the growth and activity of the community has revitalized the local area.

The Federation of Damanhur has centers in [[Europe]], [[Americas|America]], and [[Japan]].

== Life at Damanhur ==
[[File:Gelände der Gemeinschaft Damanhur.jpg|thumb|Damanhur]]

The constitution began with 3 bodies of Damanhur: The School of Meditation (ritual tradition) Social (social theory, social realization) and The Game of Life (experimentation and dynamics, life as a game, change). A fourth body was recently added, Technarcate (individual inner refinement).

Citizens participate in one of 4 levels, depending on their desired involvement: A, B, C, or D.  Class A citizens share all resources and live on site full-time.  Class B citizens contribute to financial goals and live on site a minimum of 3 days a week.  Class C and D citizens live anywhere.  (page 102, Merrifield, 2006)  Class A &amp; B citizens participate fully in The School of Meditation, Social, and the Game of Life.  Class C citizens participate fully in The School of Meditation.

Citizens participate in one of several ways, depending on their personal nature.  Ways include the Way of the Oracle, the Way of the Monk, the Way of the Knight, the Way of Health, the Way of the Word, the Way of Art &amp; Work, and many others.  Most citizens live in houses of 10-20 people each, federated together into the Federation of Damanhur.

Marriage works on a renewal basis, for a period of so many years before renewal.  Conception is timed for auspicious birthdays of children.

From 1983 onwards, members have assumed animal names (Sparrow, Prawn, Mole, etc).&lt;ref&gt;''Utopian Dreams'', Tobias Jones, 2007, [[Faber and Faber Ltd]], p 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fiscal-military state''' is a [[State (polity)|state]] that bases its [[economic model]] on the sustainment of its [[armed forces]], usually in times of prolonged or severe conflict. Characteristically, fiscal-military states will subject citizens to high [[taxation]] for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Glorious Revolution'' - uk.encarta |url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563392/Glorious_Revolution.html#s3 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwcECMi3?url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563392/Glorious_Revolution.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, states such as [[Spain]], [[the Netherlands]] and [[Sweden]], which were embroiled in long-lasting periods of war for local or global hegemony, were organized as fiscal-military states. The [[British East India Company]] also employed military fiscalism in maintenance of rule in India in the mid-18th century. [[Colonialism|Colonial powers]] generated their revenue for the maintenance of the army. Currently there are few states that could be described as fiscal-military states, which is probably due to the decline of large scale international conflicts in recent times.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3586">An '''intergenerational policy''' is a [[public policy]] that incorporates an [[Intergenerationality|intergenerational]] approach to addressing an issue or has an impact across the [[generation]]s. Approaching policy from an intergenerational perspective is based on an understanding of the [[interdependence]] and reciprocity that characterizes the relationship between the generations.

An intergenerational approach to public policy recognizes that generations share basic needs including adequate income, access to quality health care and social services, educational and employment opportunities, and a safe place to live.  Furthermore, policies that are supportive of any age group must build on the common concerns of all generations.&lt;ref&gt;Generations United.  (2010) "[http://ipath.gu.org/Guidi8151317.asp Guiding Principles]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Intergenerational policy is also understood as current efforts on [[intergenerational justice]], both by [[Government|governmental]] and [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] institutions that distribute resources between the generations. There are two types of intergenerational policies: descriptive and programmatic.&lt;ref&gt;Klimczuk, Andrzej, ''Intergenerationality, Intergenerational Justice, Intergenerational Policies'', [in:] S. Thompson (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Diversity and Social Justice'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, Lanham 2015, pp. 419-423; Lüscher, Kurt, Hoff, Andreas, Klimczuk, Andrzej, Lamura, Giovanni, Renzi, Marta, Oliveira, Paulo d.S., Sánchez, Mariano, Viry, Gil, Widmer, Eric, Neményi, Ágnes, Veress, Enikő, Bjursell, Cecilia, Boström, Ann-Kristin, Rapolienė, Gražina, Mikulionienė, Sarmitė, Oğlak, Sema, Canatan, Ayşe, Vujović, Ana, Svetelšek, Ajda, Gavranović, Nedim, Ivashchenko, Olga, Shipovskaya, Valentina, Lin, Qing, Wang, Xiying, ''[[iarchive:Kompendium17sprachig10102017Edition2017GenerationsIntergenerationalRelationshipsGenerationalPolicy|Generations, intergenerational relationships, generational policy. A multilingual compendium - Edition 2017]]'', Universität Konstanz, Konstanz 2017; &lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive intergenerational policy includes all efforts to [[Institutionalisation|institutionalize]] individual and collective relations between the generations in the private and public spheres. On the other hand, programmatic intergenerational policy refers to establishing societal conditions that allow the creation of private and public intergenerational relations in the present and future in a way that guarantees the development of a responsible and community-oriented [[personality]] on the one hand and of [[Social progress|societal progress]] on the other.

Literature includes at least five models intergenerational policies&lt;ref&gt;Klimczuk, Andrzej, ''[https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/41808 Analysis of Intergenerational Policy Models]'', "Ad Alta: Journal of Interdisciplinary Research" 1/2013, pp. 66-69.&lt;/ref&gt;. These are: (1) intergenerational [[social integration]]; (2) linking strategies of [[social policy]] towards [[old age]] and [[older adults]] ([[ageing policy]]); (3) dimensions of an intergenerational policy covering [[environmental policy]], [[architectural policy]], [[Cultural policy|(inter)cultural policy]], [[education policy]], [[economic policy]], [[labour market policy]] and [[healthcare policy]]; (4) United Nations’ “[[Society For All Ages]]“ concept; and (5) the European Union's concept of the “[[silver economy]]”.

In 2000, at the age of 35, he became the Menteri Besar of [[Selangor]] at the insistence of Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]], following the resignation of [[Abu Hassan Omar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mysinchew.com/node/29264|title=MACC hauls up Khir Toyo over Mickey Mouse, Bali house|date=15 September 2009|work=mysinchew.com|accessdate=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His appointment as Menteri Besar came in his first term as a member of the [[Selangor State Legislative Assembly|Selangor State Assembly]], having been elected as the member for Sungai Panjang in the [[Malaysian general election, 1999|1999 election]]. His young age led to allegations, which he denied, that he had dyed his hair grey to give voters the impression that he was older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3540315.stm|title=Malaysia politician denies dyed-on gravitas|last=Kent|first=Jonathan|date=7 March 2004|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khir subsequently served as a member of UMNO's Supreme Council and Chairman of Selangor Barisan Nasional from 2000 to 2008. In 2004, Dr. Mohamad Khir won UMNO Supreme Council with the highest votes. Other positions that he holds in UMNO include the Chairman of the Selangor UMNO Communications Board and UMNO Division Head of [[Sungai Besar]].

He was the Menteri Besar of Selangor until the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|12th General Election]] in March 2008. The state of Selangor fell to opposition hands following its worst defeat in Malaysian history. He was succeeded by [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]] (PKR) secretary-general, [[Abdul Khalid Ibrahim]]. However, he remains the state assemblyman of Sungai Panjang constituency and became Selangor opposition chief. After the election, he ran for the leadership of UMNO Youth, but was defeated by [[Khairy Jamaluddin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking+News/SE+Asia/Story/STIStory_354755.html|title=Khairy is Umno Youth head|last=Hong|first=Carolyn|date=26 March 2009|work=[[The Straits Times]]|publisher=[[Singapore Press Holdings]]|accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned as the opposition leader in December 2010, after he was charged with corruption over allegations that while he was the Menteri Besar, he was sold a lavish mansion for less than its market value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20101206-251079.html|title=Top Malaysian politician charged with graft over mansion|date=6 December 2010|work=asiaone|accessdate=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmail.com.my/content/57000-khir-toyo-drops-opposition-leader-post |title=Khir Toyo drops Opposition leader post |date=6 December 2010 |work=[[Bernama]] |accessdate=6 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208185323/http://www.mmail.com.my/content/57000-khir-toyo-drops-opposition-leader-post |archivedate= 8 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khir Toyo was finally sentenced to a jail term of 12 months for this act and his properties was ordered to be confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Khir Toyo gets 12 months, properties to be confiscated |author= |url= http://www.theborneopost.com/2011/12/24/khir-toyo-gets-12-months-properties-to-be-confiscated/|newspaper= [[The Borneo Post]] |date= 24 December 2011|accessdate=29 August 2012}}[ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and criticism==
===Zero Illegal Squatters Mission===
It was a mission set by Khir Toyo himself to make [[Selangor]] 'zero squatters'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parti-sosialis.org/current/KHIR+TOYO+OVERRULES+PAK+LAH.htm|title=admin – Bitcoins und Ethereum – parti-sosialis.org|website=parti-sosialis.org|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in line with national policy Wawasan 2020. The opposition criticised Khir Toyo for approving housing project in squatters' area and forcing the residents to move out from their illegal homes. They claimed some of the village claim to be illegal homes had been built before independence in 1957 and most squatters living in a prime area are left homeless and received low compensation. The majority of the squatters are forced to rent or live in low-cost flats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bolehland.com/?cat=18 |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521010051/http://www.bolehland.com/?cat=18 |archive-date=21 May 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However report show most of the land is under private owner. "The (squatters) are occupying other people's land. The land will never be theirs as they are private land. They want the land but I can't give it to them" – Dr. Khir Toyo&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bernama.com/selangor_maju/news.php?id=250182 |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823010932/http://www.bernama.com/selangor_maju/news.php?id=250182 |archive-date=23 August 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite heavy criticism from opposition before this, the new Menteri Besar from opposition party, Tan Sri Abdul Khalid Ibrahim reported said the effort to reduce the number of squatters and to free them from the clutches of poverty, should continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bernama.com/selangor_maju/newsbm.php?id=323357%E2%8C%A9=en&amp;vo=28 |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814080731/http://www.bernama.com/selangor_maju/newsbm.php?id=323357%E2%8C%A9=en&amp;vo=28 |archive-date=14 August 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, The state government had achieved 93.6 per cent success in addressing the squatter problem, having evicted 44,701 of the 47,756 squatter families to-date from all the local council areas in the state. The remaining squatters to be moved by August are 1,090 families from the Selayang Municipal Council (MPS) and 257 families from the Klang Municipal Council (MPK), the media secretariat in the Menteri Besar's Office said in a statement. A total of 1,708 squatter families were shifted following court cases, resettled to the North Gombak Orang Asli settlement and planned villages, it said. However, four local authorities still had squatters. They are MPS (984), MPK (221), Shah Alam City Council (307) and Ampang Jaya Municipal Council (196).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bernama.com/selangor_maju/newsbm.php?id=271385%E2%8C%A9%3Den%2F |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823012028/http://www.bernama.com/selangor_maju/newsbm.php?id=271385%E2%8C%A9%3Den%2F |archive-date=23 August 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bukit Cahaya Reserve===
Khir Toyo had been accused of corruption for approving a construction project which trespasses Bukit Cahaya Seri Alam in Shah Alam, a forest reserve.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929123658/http://bpms.kempen.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5308] However this land was approved before Khir took over power. To prove his innocence, Khir had asked Anti-Corruption Agency of Malaysia to investigate the incident.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929123658/http://bpms.kempen.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5308]. In 2004, Anti-Corruption Agency declared no case against Khir Toyo.

===Selangor State Development Corporation===
On 30 October, the current State government of Selangor began investigations into irregularities by the Selangor State Development Corporation when it was run by Khir Toyo. A special investigative team which was set up for the purpose would probe how certain senior officers of the corporation were holding 30% shares in a subsidiary. This included an investigation of RM100,000 gift to former Mentri Besar as a bonus. In 2007, the state government only collected RM17mil revenue from sand mining instead of the RM170mil which it was supposed to get.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090814200402/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/10/30/nation/2407153&amp;sec=nation] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thesundaily.com/article.cfm?id=26812 |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813232157/http://www.thesundaily.com/article.cfm?id=26812 |archive-date=13 August 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uganda]]  has a long and, until relatively recently, quite permissive LGBT history. During precolonial times, the “[[mudoko dako]],” or effeminate males among the [[Lango people|Langi]] of northern Uganda were treated as women and could marry men. Religious roles for cross-dressing men (homosexual priests) were historically found among the [[Bunyoro]] people. The [[Teso people]] also acknowledged a category of men who dressed as women.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Appiah and Henry Louis Gates, ''Encyclopedia of Africa, Volume 2'' OUP, USA, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Buganda]], one of the largest traditional kingdoms in Uganda, certain forms of same-sex relations were institutionalised. Young men served in the royal courts and provided sexual services for visitors and elites. It was an open secret that [[Mwanga II of Buganda|Kabaka Mwanga II]], who ruled in the latter half of the 19th century, was gay.&lt;ref&gt;{http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/4/homosexuality-africamuseveniugandanigeriaethiopia.html}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homosexuality]] in Uganda was criminalized in 1902.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-25927595 |title=Where is it illegal to be gay? |accessdate=23 February 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 2014, president [[Yoweri Museveni]] signed a new law, the [[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2014|Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act]], which provided for tougher penalties for gay people including criminalizing people who did not report them.&lt;ref name="Feb2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26320102 |title=Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni signs anti-gay bill |accessdate=24 February 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new law also covered lesbians for the first time.&lt;ref name="Feb2014"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 1 August 2014, the [[Constitutional Court of Uganda]] ruled the new law invalid.&lt;ref name=GuardianAug&gt;{{cite news|title=Uganda anti-gay law challenged in court|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/31/uganda-anti-gay-law-constitutional-court|accessdate=1 August 2014|work=The Guardian|agency=AFP|date=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCAug&gt;{{cite news|title=Uganda court annuls anti-gay law|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28605400|accessdate=1 August 2014|work=BBC News|date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TimesAug&gt;{{cite news|title=Uganda constitutional court annuls new anti-gay law|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/africa/2014/08/01/uganda-constitutional-court-annuls-new-anti-gay-law|accessdate=1 August 2014|work=Times LIVE|agency=AFP|date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Libertarian Communism''''' was a [[socialist]] [[academic journal|journal]] founded in 1974 and produced in part by members of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;"papers relating to Libertarian Communism (a splinter group of the SPGB) including journals and miscellaneous correspondence, 1970-1980 (1 box)"[[Socialist Party of Great Britain|"Socialist Party of Great Britain" at Archives Hub at the Great Research Centre]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the 1960s the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] was enthused by an influx of new recruits initially politicised by the [[CND]] marches, [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and the [[May 1968 in France|May Events of 1968]]. The boost to Party membership and activity at this time was considerable.

Influenced by the prevailing political climate, some members who joined in this period wanted to change the emphasis of the Party’s propaganda efforts towards taking a more positive attitude to [[trade unionism|industrial struggles]], [[Claimants Union]]s and [[Tenants Association]]s, but also to [[women's liberation]] and [[squatting]], arguing that the Party had developed a somewhat idealist conception of how [[class consciousness|socialist consciousness]] arises, being divorced from the day-to-day struggles of workers. To this effect fifteen activists from the 60s generation signed a mini-[[manifesto]] entitled “Where We Stand” in 1973 and circulated it inside the Party. 

One particular group of these activists published an internal discussion bulletin, which, in 1974, converted itself into an externally oriented journal called ''Libertarian Communism''. This was produced with the aid of non-members and supported the idea of [[workers' council]]s. It openly attacked as "[[Karl Kautsky|Kautsky]]ite" the Party’s traditional conception of the socialist revolution being facilitated through Parliament. At the same time another group of younger members, based mainly in [[Aberdeen]] and [[Edinburgh]], was keen that the Party express support for such things as higher student grants (on the grounds that the Socialist Party was always prepared to support demands for higher wages). The arguments of this group found no more favour with the majority in the Party than those put forward by the group around ''Libertarian Communism''. Both groups were expelled for issuing literature that contradicted Party policy.{{citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Aftermath==
The prominent activists of the time who were either expelled or left of their own volition typically became involved in [[single-issue campaigns]] or the [[radical feminist]] movement. However, one network of former members — those based around ''Libertarian Communism'', who were critical of the Party’s revolutionary strategy and attracted by [[council communism|council communist]] ideas — created an organisation called '''Social Revolution''' along with the Aberdeen and Edinburgh activists, which later joined the [[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]] group. Some years later a number of these activists were also involved in the foundation of the [[Wildcat (UK)|Wildcat]] council communist group and one of its successors, [[Subversion (UK)|Subversion]].

* '''1944''' [[Hydro-Québec]], first created through partial nationalisation of electricity concerns around [[Montreal]] in [[Quebec]] by the Liberal government of [[Adélard Godbout]].

===Croatia===

On the break-up of Yugoslavia, The HDZ government nationalized private agricultural property and rezoned it under the guise of forest statesmanship, when their publicly professed agenda was to only complete the nationalization of the communists. Much of this land is in the process of being reinstated and the model rethought.

===Cuba===
After the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959 the Castro government gradually expropriated all foreign-owned private companies, most of which were owned by American corporations and individuals. The immediate trigger was the refusal by American owned oil refineries to refine the crude received from the [[Soviet Union]]. Faced with the prospect of no oil, Cuba nationalized the three American refineries. This action escalated the US embargo on Cuba, which responded by nationalizing all American owned property. Eventually all Cuban private property, largely owned by Cubans sympathetic to the Batista led dictatorship, was nationalized.

From 1966-68, the Castro government nationalized all remaining [[Privately held company|privately owned businesses]] in Cuba, down to the level of street vendors.

Castro had offered bonds at 4.5% interest over twenty years to U.S. companies, but U.S. ambassador [[Philip Bonsal]] requested the compensation up front and rejected the offer.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Hugh |title=Cuba; the Pursuit of Freedom |date=March 1971 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |isbn=0-06-014259-6 |authorlink=Hugh Thomas, Baron Thomas of Swynnerton|pages=224, p252}}&lt;/ref&gt; A minor amount of $1.3 million, was paid to U.S. interests before deteriorating relations ended all cooperation between the two governments.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; The U.S. established a registry of claims against the Cuban government, ultimately developing files on 5,911 specific companies. The Cuban government has refused to discuss the compensation of U.S. claims and the U.S. government continues to insist on compensation for U.S. companies.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Czechoslovakia===
* '''1945''' Large manufacturing enterprises.
* '''1948''' All manufacturing enterprises.

===Egypt===
* '''1956''' On July 26, 1956 [[Egypt]]ian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] [[Suez Crisis|nationalized]] the [[Suez Canal Company]].

===France===
Nationalisation dates back to the 'regies' or state monopolies organized under the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'', for example, the monopoly on tobacco sales. Communications companies [[France Telecom]] and [[La Poste (France)|La Poste]] are relics of the state postal and telecommunications monopolies.

There was a major expansion of the nationalised sector following World War II.&lt;ref name="Myers49"&gt;Myers (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave followed in 1982.
* '''1938''' Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français ([[SNCF]]) (originally a 51% State holding, increased to 100% in 1982)&lt;ref name="Myers49"/&gt;
* '''1945''' Several nationalisations in France, including most important banks and [[Renault]].&lt;ref name="Myers49"/&gt; The firm was seized for [[Louis Renault (industrialist)|Louis Renault]]'s alleged collaboration with [[Nazi Germany]], although this condemnation was without judgement and after his death, making this case remarkable and rare. A later judgement (1949) admitted that Renault's plant never collaborated. Renault was successful but unprofitable whilst nationalised and remains successful today, after having been partially privatized in 1996. France increased its 15% minority share holding in Renault to 19% in 2015. 
* '''1946''' [[Charbonnages de France]], [[Electricite de France]] (EdF), [[Gaz de France]] (GdF)
* '''1982''' [[François Mitterrand]]'s alliance with [[Jean-Pierre Chevènement]]'s Socialist Party faction CERES, committed France to an explicitly socialist ‘rupture with capitalism’. Full nationalisation (100%): the [[Alcatel-Lucent|Compagnie Générale d'Electricité]], the Compagnie Générale de Constructions Téléphoniques, Pechiney-Ugine-Kuhlmann, [[Rhône-Poulenc]], Saint-Gobain-Pont-à-Mousson, Thompson-Brandt. Partial nationalisation (51%+): [[Dassault]], [[Groupe Bull|Honeywell-Bull]], [[Matra]], [[Roussel Uclaf|Roussel-Uclaf]], [[Sacilor]], [[Usinor]]. Thirty-nine banks, two financial houses, and the remaining 49% of the SNCF were also nationalised, taking the size of the French state to unprecedented levels within a year of Mitterrand's [[French presidential election, 1981|election]] as President in 1981.

The Paris regional transport operator, [[RATP Group]], can also be counted as a nationalised industry.

===Germany===
The railways were nationalised after World War I. Partial privatisation of [[Deutsche Bahn]] is currently underway, as of 2008.

Large sections of the mining, banking, and shipping industries either became dependent on government money or were placed entirely under care of the Weimar Republic in the wake of the Great Depression; these were later reprivatized between 1934-1937 by the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bel|first1=Germà|title=Against the Mainstream: Nazi privatization in 1930s Germany|journal=The Economic History Review|date=February 2010|volume=63|issue=1|pages=35–36|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00473.x|jstor=27771569|url=http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/11716/1/162.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most enterprises in East Germany were nationalised following World War II. After reunification, an agency, [[Treuhand]], was established to return them to private ownership, however many were liquidated.
* '''2008''' Renationalization of the "[[Bundesdruckerei]]" (Federal Print Office), which had been privatized in 2001.

A parallel body, Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi ([[Eni]]) was set up to manage State oil and gas interests.

Along with the telecommunications companies, which were state-owned even before the Revolution, many of the nationalized companies were reprivatized in the 1980s and 1990s. In the [[Agriculture in Portugal|agricultural sector]], according to government estimates, about {{convert|900000|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of agricultural land were occupied between April 1974 and December 1975 in the name of land reform; about 32% of the occupations were ruled illegal. In January 1976, the government pledged to restore the illegally occupied land to its owners, and in 1977, it promulgated the Land Reform Review Law. Restoration of illegally occupied land began in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://countrystudies.us/portugal/63.htm | quote = In the mid-1980s, agricultural productivity was half that of the levels in Greece and Spain and a quarter of the EC average. The land tenure system was polarized between two extremes: small and fragmented family farms in the north and large collective farms in the south that proved incapable of modernizing. The decollectivization of agriculture, which began in modest form in the late 1970s and accelerated in the late 1980s, promised to increase the efficiency of human and land resources in the south during the 1990s. | publisher = U.S. Library of Congress | work = Country Studies | title = Portugal | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Nationalization was a key feature of the first post [[World War II]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government, from 1945 to 1951 under [[Clement Attlee]]. The [[Coal mining|coal]] and [[steel]] industries were just two of many industries or services to be nationalised, while the formation of the [[National Health Service]] in 1948 entitled everyone to free healthcare. The subsequent [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] governments led by [[Winston Churchill]], [[Anthony Eden]], [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Alec Douglas-Home]] and [[Edward Heath]] allowed practically all of the nationalized industries and services to remain in public ownership, as part of the [[Post-War Consensus]]. However, the election victory of [[Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher's]] Conservatives in 1979 saw the vast majority of nationalized industries, services and utilities privatized within a decade. The National Health Service was allowed to continue.  The Labour Party initially opposed Thatcher's privatization, but the party's commitment to nationalisation had been abandoned by the time it swept back into power in 1997 under [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7250252.stm | work=BBC News | first=Steve | last=Schifferes | title=The lessons of nationalisation | date=February 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2008, Blair's successor [[Gordon Brown]] nationalized the failing [[Northern Rock]] bank during the [[Great Recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7249575.stm | work=BBC News | title=Northern Rock to be nationalised | date=February 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The much larger [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] and [[HBOS|Halifax Bank of Scotland]] were part nationalized for the same reason in October of that year. After nearly four years in public ownership, Northern Rock was sold to [[Virgin Money UK|Virgin Money]] and Royal Bank of Scotland agreed a branch sale to the [[Santander Group]] in November 2011. However, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds remain in public ownership five years later and in November 2012 the Public Accounts Committee warned that it could be many years before the banks are sold and the £66 billion so far invested in these banks may never be recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20349579 | work=BBC News | title=MPs: Sale of RBS or Lloyds 'not for years' | date=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====British assets nationalised by other countries====
* '''1940s''' Argentine railways
* '''1953''' [[BP|British Petroleum]]'s Iranian assets (actually a nationalisation of part of a part-nationalised company)
* '''1956''' The [[Egypt|Egyptian Government]] nationalised the [[Suez Canal]], owned by the Suez Canal Company which was part owned by the British government.
* '''1962''' The [[Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka Government]] nationalised the assets of the partly British-owned [[Royal Dutch Shell]] company.
* '''1975''' The [[Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka Government]] nationalised the assets of the British-owned [[plantation]] companies.

===United States===
* '''1917''': [[Merck &amp; Co.]] seized by the government during the war, later became a private company, separate from the original [[Merck Group]] operating outside of the US.
* '''1917''': All U.S. railroads were operated (but not owned) by the [[United States Railroad Administration|Railroad Administration]] during [[United States home front during World War I|World War I]] as a wartime measure. Railroads were returned to private control in 1920.
* '''1918''': The U.S. telephone system was nationalized on July 31, 1918, and placed under control of the Post Office department. It was returned to private ownership on July 31, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1466&amp;context=faculty_scholarship The Wires Go to War: The U.S. Experiment with Government Ownership of the Telephone System During World War I]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1939''': Organization of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] entailed the nationalization of the Tennessee Electric Power Company.
* '''1971''': The National Railroad Passenger Corporation ([[Amtrak]]) is a [[government-owned corporation]] created in 1971 for the express purpose of relieving American railroads of their legal obligation to provide [[inter-city rail|inter-city passenger rail]] service. The (primarily) freight railroads had petitioned to abandon passenger service repeatedly in the decades leading up to Amtrak's formation.
* '''1976''': The Consolidated Rail Corporation ([[Conrail]]) was created to take over the operations of six bankrupt rail lines operating primarily in the Northeast; Conrail was privatized in 1987. Initial plans for Conrail would have made it a truly nationalized system like that during World War I, but an alternate proposal by the [[Association of American Railroads]] won out.
* '''1980s''': [[Resolution Trust Corporation]] seized control of hundreds of failed [[Savings and loan association|Savings &amp; Loans]].
* '''2001''': In response to the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[airport security]] industry was nationalized and put under the authority of the [[Transportation Security Administration]].
* '''2008''': Some economists consider the government's [[Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac|takeover]] of the [[Freddie Mac|Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation]] and [[Fannie Mae|Federal National Mortgage Association]] to have been nationalization (or renationalization).&lt;ref name="Ref_n"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-09-08-127573146_x.htm US rescue of Fannie, Freddie poses taxpayer risks]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_o"&gt;[http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/diamond-and-kashyap-on-the-recent-financial-upheavals/ Diamond and Kashyap on the Recent Financial Upheavals]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[conservatorship]] model used with [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] is looser and more temporary than nationalization.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{Cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20439">'''Martial law in the United States''' refers to several periods in [[History of the United States|United States history]] wherein a region or the United States as whole are placed under the control of a military body. On a federal level, only the president has the power to impose Martial Law. In each state the governor has the right to impose martial law within the borders of the state. In the United States, [[martial law]] has been used in a limited number of circumstances, such as directly after a foreign attack, such as Hawaii after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] or New Orleans during the [[Battle of New Orleans]]; after major disasters, such as the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871 or the San Francisco [[earthquake of 1906]]; renegade local leaders seeking to avoid arrest, such as [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] during the [[Illinois Mormon War]], or [[Utah]] during the [[Utah War]]; or in response to chaos associated with protests and mob action, such as the [[1934 West Coast waterfront strike]], or mob actions against the [[Freedom Riders]].  

The martial law concept in the [[United States]] is closely tied with the right of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', which is in essence the right to a hearing on lawful imprisonment, or more broadly, the supervision of law enforcement by the judiciary. The ability to suspend ''habeas corpus'' is related to the imposition of martial law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G. Edward White|title=Law in American History: Volume 1: From the Colonial Years Through the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP1oAgAAQBAJ|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-972314-0|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP1oAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA442&amp;dq=%22martial+law%22+%22habeas+corpus%22 442]|quote=As the above details suggest, the imposition of martial law and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus are related, but do not perform identical functions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1, Section 9 of the [[US Constitution]] states, "The Privilege of the Writ of ''Habeas Corpus'' shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it."  There have been many instances of the use of the military within the borders of the United States, such as during the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] and in the South during the [[Civil Rights Movement]], but these acts are not tantamount to a declaration of martial law. The distinction must be made as clear as that between martial law and [[military justice]]: deployment of troops does not necessarily mean that the civil courts cannot function, and that is one of the keys, as the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] noted, to martial law.

In [[United States law]], martial law is limited by several court decisions that were handed down between the [[American Civil War]] and [[World War II]]. In 1878, [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] passed the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], which forbids military involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval.

Throughout [[United States history]] are several examples of the imposition of martial law, aside from that during the [[US Civil War|Civil War]].

==The American Revolution==
[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|225px|The Boston Tea Party prompted Great Britain to pass the [[Massachusetts Government Act]].]]
As a result of the [[Boston Tea Party]], [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] passed the [[Massachusetts Government Act]], one of the [[Intolerable Acts]], which suppressed town meetings and assemblies, and imposed appointed government, tantamount to martial law.&lt;ref&gt;colonial-america.suite101.com/article.cfm/law-that-started-the-american-revolution&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1920256 "Governors or Generals?: A Note on Martial Law and the Revolution of 1689 in English America"], Ian Steele, ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Third Series, Vol. 46, No. 2 (Apr., 1989), pp. 304–314&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldsouthmeetinghouse.org/osmh_123456789files/TeaPartyTimeline.aspx "Home &gt; Boston Tea Party &gt; A Tea Party Timeline: 1773–1775"], ''Old South Meeting House''&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Orleans, Louisiana in the War of 1812==
During the [[War of 1812]], [[General (United States)|US General]] [[Andrew Jackson]] imposed martial law in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] before repulsing the British in the [[Battle of New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4233516 "The Battle of New Orleans Reconsidered: Andrew Jackson and Martial Law"], Matthew Warshauer, ''Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association'', Vol. 39, No. 3 (Summer, 1998), pp. 261–291&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/P/aj7/about/bio/jack07.htm "A National Hero, the Battle of New Orleans"], ''Andrew Jackson (1767–1845)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&amp;url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/112.5/br_38.html "Book Review: Andrew Jackson and the Politics of Martial Law: Nationalism, Civil Liberties, and Partisanship."] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120905045153/http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&amp;url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/112.5/br_38.html |date=2012-09-05 }}, ''American Historical Review'', December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Martial law was also imposed in a four-mile radius around the vicinity. When word came of the end of the war, Jackson maintained martial law, contending that he had not gotten official word of the peace. A judge demanded ''[[habeas corpus]]'' for a man arrested for sedition. Rather than comply with the writ, Jackson had the judge arrested.

==Nauvoo, Illinois during the [[Illinois Mormon War]]==
In 1843, Missouri sought to extradite [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of [[Mormonism]], for the [[Attempted assassination of Lilburn Boggs|attempted murder of Missouri governor Lilburn Boggs]].  He escaped arrest with the help of members of his church, and was discharged on a writ of habeas corpus in the [[Municipal Court of Nauvoo]], where he was mayor, even though it was outside the court's jurisdiction.  People in the neighboring town of [[Carthage, Illinois]] felt that Smith was abusing his position in order to avoid arrest.  They requested that Governor Ford call out the militia to take Smith into custody, to which Governor Ford declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zW0sBgAAQBAJ|title=Prairie Justice: A History of Illinois Courts under French, English, and American Law|author=Roger L Severns|publisher=SIU Press|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|139}}  A group of ex-Mormons published a paper called the [[Nauvoo Expositor]] which detailed Smith's alleged abuse of power.  Together with the [[Nauvoo City Council]], Smith ordered the destruction of the Nauvoo Expositor.  This caused an uproar in neighboring towns, who interpreted the order as an attack on the freedom of speech.  Smith was charged with causing a riot, which the Nauvoo courts dismissed.  Neighboring cities raised money for a militia to go and capture Smith.&lt;ref name=Oaks /&gt;  Governor Ford arrived in Carthage and sent word to Smith that if he did not surrender, Ford would call out the militia.

==Utah during the [[Utah War]]==
[[Image:Brigham Young.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Governor [[Brigham Young]] declared martial law on September 15, 1857 in Utah shortly before being removed as governor.]]
Tension between [[Utah territory]] and the federal government was strained in 1857 due to the influence of [[theodemocracy]] in the Governor Brigham Young's semi-theocratic government, Utah's [[Runaway Officials of 1851|rejection of Federal appointees]], and Utah's acceptance of [[Mormonism and polygamy|polygamy]] and [[Mormonism and slavery|slavery]].  In 1857, [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Buchanan]] sent U.S. forces to the [[Utah Territory]] in what became known as the [[Utah War]]. The [[Mormon]]s, fearful that the large U.S. military force had been sent to annihilate them made preparations for defense.  On 15 September, Young publicly declared martial law in Utah.  It was widely circulated throughout the Territory and was delivered by messenger to Col. Alexander with the approaching army. The most important provision forbade "''all armed forces of every description from coming into this Territory, under any pretense whatsoever''."&lt;ref name=procHafen&gt;"Proclamation of Governor Young," [[Leroy R. Hafen]] &amp; Ann W. Hafen (eds.), ''Mormon Resistance: A Documentary Account of the Utah Expedition, 1857–1858'', 65.&lt;/ref&gt; It also commanded that "''all the forces in said Territory hold themselves in readiness to march at a moment's notice to repel any and all such invasion''."&lt;ref name=procHafen/&gt; But more important to California and Oregon bound travelers was the third section that stated "''Martial law is hereby declared to exist in this Territory...and no person shall be allowed to pass or repass into, through or from this territory without a permit from the proper officer''."&lt;ref name=procHafen/&gt;  Brigham Young ordered the people in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] to burn their homes and retreat south to [[Provo, Utah]].  Meanwhile, the Mormons harassed the approaching army.  Eventually, Brigham Young was removed as governor and replaced by [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|Alfred Cumming]].

==''Ex parte Milligan''==
On September 15, 1863 President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] imposed Congressionally authorized martial law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/consttop_mlaw.html|title=Constitutional Topic: Martial Law - The U.S. Constitution Online - USConstitution.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorizing act allowed the President to suspend ''habeas corpus'' throughout the entire United States (which he had already done under his own authority on April 27, 1861). Lincoln imposed the suspension on "prisoners of war, spies, or aiders and abettors of the enemy," as well as on other classes of people, such as draft dodgers. The President's proclamation was challenged in ''[[Ex parte Milligan]]'', 71 US 2 [1866]. The Supreme Court ruled that Lincoln's imposition of martial law (by way of suspension of ''habeas corpus'') was unconstitutional in areas where the local courts were still in session.

==The Great Chicago Fire==
[[File:Chicago in Flames by Currier &amp; Ives, 1871 (cropped).jpg|thumb|225px|upright=1.5|Artist's rendering of the Great Chicago Fire]]
In response to the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, [[Chicago]] mayor [[Roswell B. Mason]] declared a state of martial law and placed General [[Philip Sheridan]] in charge of the city on October 9, 1871. After the fire was extinguished, there were no widespread disturbances and martial law was lifted within a few days.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Roy, Jr., ''Sheridan: The Life and Wars of General Phil Sheridan'', Crown Publishing, 1992, pp. 335–8. {{ISBN|0-517-58070-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, 1892==
In 1892, in [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]], striking mine workers blew up a mill and shot at strike-breaking workers. The explosion leveled a four-story building and killed one person. The governor declared martial law. At the same time, a request was made for federal troops to back guardsmen. Over 600 people were arrested. The list was whittled down to two dozen [[wikt:ringleader|ringleader]]s who were tried in military court. While in prison, the mine workers formed a new union, the [[Western Federation of Miners]].

==San Francisco earthquake of 1906==
Following the [[earthquake of 1906]], the troops stationed in the Presidio were pressed into martial law service. Guards were posted throughout the city, and all dynamite was confiscated. The dynamite was used to destroy buildings in the path of fires, to prevent the fires from spreading.

==Colorado Coalfield War==
In 1914, imposition of martial law climaxed the so-called [[Colorado Coalfield War]]. Dating back decades, the conflicts came to a head in [[Ludlow, Colorado]] in 1913. The [[Colorado National Guard]] was called in to quell the strikers. For a time, the peace was kept, but it is reported that the make-up of the Guard stationed at the mines began to shift from impartial normal troops to companies of loyal mine guards. Clashes increased and the proclamation of martial law was made by the governor, eventually resulting in the [[Ludlow Massacre]]. [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] sent in federal troops, eventually ending the violence.

On August 19, 1917, the Spokane office of the IWW (Industrial Workers of the World, or Wobblies) was raided, leaders arrested, and martial law was declared. The military authority was the National Guard, controlled by the U.S. War Department. This occurred in reaction to a demand by IWW leader James Rowan that all prisoners of the "class war" (he meant Wobbly strikers and strike leaders involved in a statewide lumber strike) be released or Spokane would face a general strike. 
The repression of the democratic, radical union in Spokane and across the state took place in the context of the Wobbly-led loggers'and sawmill workers'ongoing strike for the eight-hour day and sanitary conditions in the camps. The IWW was militant, radical, vocal and consistently nonviolent. 
The larger context of the repression of the union was war hysteria, combined with employer opposition to union demands. The nationwide suppression of the IWW during the war involved physical violence, vandalism, and the imprisonment of hundreds of union members and leaders.

==West Virginia Coal Wars==
[[File:The USS Arizona (BB-39) burning after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor - NARA 195617 - Edit.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Hawaii was put under martial law after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]]
During the events of the [[West Virginia Coal Wars]] (1920–1921), martial law was declared in the state of West Virginia. At the behest of [[John J. Cornwell|Governor Cornwell]], federal troops had been dispatched to Mingo County to deal with the striking miners. The army officer in charge acted, ostensibly, under the [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Suspension Clause of Article I of the United States Constitution]] (selectively; accounts show that he only jailed union miners), and did not allow assembly of any kind. If his soldiers found any union miners, they immediately took them and imprisoned them. The jails filled up so quickly that he had to release miners. As it went, miners were arrested, jailed, and released without any sort of trial. After a time, when the trial of [[Sid Hatfield]] began, the military occupation and "veritable [[military dictatorship]]" (Governor Cornwell) of the army officer ended. Many of the miners were not released from jail. It was only the first of three times that federal troops would be called to quiet the miners in the West Virginia Mine War.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==San Francisco, California, 1934==
In 1934, [[California]] Governor [[Frank Merriam]] placed the docks of [[San Francisco]] under martial law, citing "riots and tumult" resulting from a [[1934 West Coast waterfront strike|dock worker's strike]]. The Governor threatened to place the entire city under martial law. The National Guard was called in to open the docks, and a citywide institution of martial law was averted when goods began to flow. The guardsmen were empowered to make arrests and to then try detainees or turn them over to the courts.

==The Territory of Hawaii==
[[File:Freedom Riders attacked.jpg|thumb|The mob action associated with the Freedom Riders led to martial law in Alabama.]]
During [[World War II]] (1939 to 1945) what is now the [[State of Hawaii]] was held under martial law from December 7, 1941 to October 24, 1944, following the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cup.columbia.edu/media/5004/robinson-tragedy.pdf |title=Martial Law in Hawaii |accessdate=June 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620033603/http://cup.columbia.edu/media/5004/robinson-tragedy.pdf |archivedate=June 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the federal judge for the islands condemned the conduct of martial law, saying, "[[Joseph Poindexter|Gov. Poindexter]] declared lawfully martial law but the Army went beyond the governor and set up that which was lawful only in conquered enemy territory namely, [[Military occupation|military government]] which is not bound by the Constitution. And they ... threw the Constitution into the discard and set up a [[military dictatorship]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1999-09-13|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/1999/09/13/special/|newspaper=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|last=Borreca|first=Richard|title=Christmas 1941 in Hawaii was not a time to rejoice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom Riders==
{{Main article|Freedom Riders}}
On May 21, 1961, [[John Malcolm Patterson|Governor Patterson]] of [[Alabama]] declared martial law "as a result of outside agitators coming into Alabama to violate our laws and customs" which had led to "outbreaks of lawlessness and mob action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.archives.alabama.gov/cdm/ref/collection/voices/id/5382 |title=Proclamation by Governor John Patterson, declaring a state of martial rule in Montgomery}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agitators were [[Freedom Riders]], peaceful [[civil rights]] activists challenging the already-illegal [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] in [[Southern United States|the South]].

'''''Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission''''', 584 U.S. ___ (2018), was a case in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] that dealt with whether owners of [[public accommodations]] can refuse certain services based on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] claims of [[Freedom of speech in the United States|free speech]] and [[Free Exercise Clause|free exercise of religion]], and therefore be given an exemption from laws ensuring [[Anti-discrimination law|non-discrimination]] in [[public accommodations|public accommodation]] — in particular, by refusing to provide creative services, such as making a [[wedding cake]] for the [[same-sex marriage|marriage of a same-sex couple]], on the basis of the owner's religious beliefs.

The case dealt with Masterpiece Cakeshop, a bakery in [[Lakewood, Colorado|Lakewood]], [[Colorado]], which refused to provide a wedding cake to a gay couple based on the owner's religious beliefs.  The Colorado Civil Rights Commission, evaluating the case under the state's anti-discrimination law, the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, found the bakery discriminated against the couple and issued specific orders for the bakery to follow. Following appeals within the state that affirmed the Commission's decision, the bakery took the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In a 7-2 decision, the Court ruled on narrow grounds that the Commission did not employ religious neutrality, violating Masterpiece owner Jack Phillips' rights to free exercise, and reversed the Commission's decision. The Court did not rule on the broader intersection of anti-discrimination laws, free exercise of religion, and freedom of speech, due to the complications of the Commission's lack of religious neutrality.

==Procedural history==
===Facts of the case===
[[File:Masterpiece Cakeshop (Lakewood, Colorado).JPG|275px|thumb|left|Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado]]
In 2012, same-sex couple Charlie Craig and David Mullins from [[Colorado]] made plans to be lawfully married in [[Massachusetts]] and return to Colorado to celebrate with their family and friends. At that time state law did not provide for [[same-sex marriage in Colorado]], though by 2014 the state had allowed same-sex marriages, and the Supreme Court of the United States would affirm that gay couples have the fundamental right to marry in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' {{Ussc|576|___|2015|el=no}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-to-take-case-on-baker-who-refused-to-sell-wedding-cake-to-gay-couple/2017/06/26/0c2f8606-0cde-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html | title = Supreme Court to take case on baker who refused to sell wedding cake to gay couple | first = Robert | last = Barnes | date = June 26, 2017 | access-date = June 26, 2017 | work =[[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig and Mullins visited Masterpiece Cakeshop in [[Lakewood, Colorado|Lakewood]], Colorado in July 2012 to order a wedding cake for their return celebration. Masterpiece's owner Jack Phillips, who is a [[Christian]], declined their cake request, informing the couple that he did not create wedding cakes for same-sex marriages owing to his Christian religious beliefs, although the couple could purchase other baked goods in the store. Craig and Mullins promptly left Masterpiece without discussing with Phillips any details of their wedding cake.&lt;ref name="CCA decision"/&gt;{{rp|2}}   The following day, Craig's mother, Deborah Munn, called Phillips, who advised her that Masterpiece did not make wedding cakes for same-sex weddings&lt;ref name="CCA decision"&gt;''[http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/16-111-op-bel-colo-app.pdf Craig v. Masterpiece Cake Shop et al.]'', No. 14CA1351 (Colo. Ct. of App. August 13, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} because of his religious beliefs and because Colorado did not recognize same-sex marriages.&lt;ref name="new yorker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CCA decision"/&gt;{{rp|1–2}}

===Colorado Civil Rights Commission===
While another bakery provided a cake to the couple, Craig and Mullins filed a complaint to the Colorado Civil Rights Commission under the state's [[public accommodations]] law, the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, which prohibits businesses open to the public from discriminating against their customers on the basis of race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-court-gays-religion-20170626-story.html | title = Supreme Court will hear case of Colorado baker who refused to make wedding cake for same-sex couple | first= David | last= Savage | date = June 26, 2017 | accessdate = June 26, 2017 | work = [[The Los Angeles Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="new yorker"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/christian-bakers-gay-weddings-and-a-question-for-the-supreme-court | title = Christian Bakers, Gay Weddings, and a Question for the Supreme Court |first = Roger | last = Parloff | date = March 6, 2017 | accessdate = June 27, 2017 | work = [[The New Yorker]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado is one of twenty-one U.S. states that have anti-discrimination laws against sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="latimes sept2017"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-court-religion-gays-20170912-story.html | title = Colorado cake maker asks Supreme Court to provide a religious liberty right to refuse gay couple | first = David | last = Savage | date = September 12, 2017 | accessdate = September 14, 2017 | work = [[The Los Angeles Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig and Mullins' complaint resulted in a lawsuit, ''Craig v.

===Colorado Court of Appeals===
Masterpiece appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals with the aid of [[Alliance Defending Freedom]], and refused to comply with the state's orders, instead opting to remove themselves from the wedding cake business;&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; Phillips claimed that this decision cost him 40% of his business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/wedding-cakes-can-be-stunning-creations-but-do-they-qualify-as-art/2017/11/29/7df64684-cb2a-11e7-aa96-54417592cf72_story.html | title = Wedding cakes can be stunning creations. But do they qualify as art? | first = Roxanne | last = Roberts | date = November 30, 2017 | accessdate = December 1, 2017 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] represented Craig and Mullins during the appeals.&lt;ref name="new yorker"/&gt; The state's decision was upheld on the grounds that despite the nature of creating a custom cake, the act of making the cake was part of the expected conduct of Phillips' business, and not an expression of free speech nor free exercise of religion.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="certiorari"/&gt; The court distinguished its decision in ''Craig'' from another case, brought to the Commission by William Jack, in which three bakeries refused to create a cake for William Jack with the message "Homosexuality is a detestable sin. [[Leviticus]] 18:22",&lt;ref name="CCA decision"/&gt;{{rp|21}} citing that in the latter, the bakeries had made other cakes for Christian customers and declined that order based on the offensive message rather than the customers' creed, whereas Masterpiece Cakeshop's refusal to provide Craig &amp; Mullins with a wedding cake "was because of its opposition to same sex marriage which...is tantamount to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation."&lt;ref name="CCA decision"/&gt;{{rp|21}}

The [[Supreme Court of Colorado]] declined to hear an appeal.&lt;ref name="certiorari"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

==Before the Supreme Court==
===Petition for writ of certiorari===
Masterpiece Cakeshop petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for ''[[certiorari]]'' (review), under the case name ''Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission'', of the following question:&lt;ref name="SCOTUS docket"/&gt;
{{quote|Whether applying Colorado's public accommodations law to compel Phillips to create expression that violates his sincerely held religious beliefs about marriage violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution#Freedom of speech and of the press|Free Speech]] or [[Free Exercise Clause|Free Exercise]] Clauses of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name="certiorari"&gt;{{cite web|title=Petition for a Writ of Certiorari|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/16-111-cert-petition.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Both the Colorado Civil Rights Commission and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) urged the Supreme Court to reject the appeal, fearing that a Court decision in favor of the business would create a "gaping hole" in civil rights laws on the basis of religion.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; The final briefs at the certiorari stage were received in December 2016.&lt;ref name="SCOTUS docket"&gt;{{cite web|title=Docket for case No. 16-111|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/16-111.html|website=Supreme Court of the United States|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court agreed to hear the case in the 2017 term&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/26/politics/supreme-court-religious-liberty-case-next-term/index.html?adkey=bn | title = Supreme Court agrees to hear religious liberty case next term | first1 = Ariane | last1 = de Vogue | first2 =  Daniella | last2=  Diaz | date = June 25, 2017 | accessdate = June 25, 2017 | work = [[CNN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and oral arguments were heard on December 5, 2017.&lt;ref name="usatoday briefs"/&gt;

In further filings, Masterpiece requested that the Colorado anti-discrimination law be reviewed by the Supreme Court under [[strict scrutiny]]. He further identified that while the state's law is to assure that same-sex couples had access to the same services as heterosexual couples, the law goes too far in its enforcement, since Craig and Mullins were easily able to obtain a wedding cake from a different vendor in the state.&lt;ref name="scotusblog sept2017"/&gt; Masterpiece further believed the anti-discrimination law can be used to selectively discriminate against religion, as the Commission has allowed bakers to refuse to provide cakes with anti-same-sex marriage messages on them, even though the Commission said these refusals were appropriate due to the offensiveness of the messages and not on the basis of religion.&lt;ref name="scotusblog sept2017"/&gt; The State and the ACLU countered these points, stating the law was aimed only at conduct of a business, not their speech, and in cases like a wedding cake, "[no] reasonable observer would understand the Company’s provision of a cake to a gay couple as an expression of its approval of the customer's marriage".&lt;ref name="scotusblog sept2017"/&gt; They further argued that the cakeshop could provide catchall language to explain that any services they provide do not endorse any expressions of free speech associated with it, an allowance within the anti-discrimination law.&lt;ref name="scotusblog sept2017"/&gt;

===Amicus briefs===
Around 100 legal briefs were filed by third parties, roughly equally split in supporting either side of the case.&lt;ref name="usatoday briefs"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/11/02/free-speech-v-same-sex-marriage-case-floods-high-court/820672001/| title = Free speech v. same-sex marriage case floods high court | first = Richard | last = Wolf | date = November 2, 2017 | accessdate = November 14, 2017 | work = [[USA Today]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many civil rights organizations filed briefs in support of Craig and Mullins, including the NAACP Legal Defense Fund,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/16-111_bsac_naacp_legal_defense_educational_fund_inc.pdf|title=Brief of Amicus Curiae NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund in Support of Respondents|last=|first=|date=October 30, 2017|website=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Southern Poverty Law Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/16-111_bsac_lawyers_committee_for_civil_rights_under_law.pdf|title=Brief amici curiae of Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, et al.|last=|first=|date=October 30, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/16-111_bsac_washington-lawyers-committee.pdf|title=Brief of Amicus Curiae Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, Public Interest Law Center, Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, and Mississippi Center for Justice in Support of Respondents|last=|first=|date=October 30, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Civil Rights Forum, a group of plaintiff-side civil rights attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/16-111-bsac-Civil-Rights-Forum.pdf|title=Brief of Amicus Curiae for the Civil Rights Forum in Support of Respondents|last=|first=|date=October 30, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those supporting Phillips include the [[United States Department of Justice]] under the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]].&lt;ref name="econom"&gt;{{cite news|author1=S.M.|title=The Department of Justice backs a baker who refused to make a gay wedding cake|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/09/taking-cake|accessdate=12 September 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes sept2017" /&gt; While the Department asserts that anti-discrimination laws are necessary to prevent businesses that provide goods and services, these laws cannot be used to compel a business into expressing speech they do not agree with, nor used to provide goods and services with such expressions without the ability for the business to assert they do not agree with those expressions.&lt;ref name="scotusblog sept2017"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/09/wedding-cakes-v-religious-beliefs-plain-english/ | title = Wedding cakes v. religious beliefs?: In Plain English | first = Amy | last = Howe | date = September 11, 2017 | accessdate = September 14, 2017 | work = [[SCOTUSblog]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The brief was criticized by several organizations, including those that support [[LGBT rights]], claiming the brief as a pattern of hostile actions by the Trump administration and fearing that a decision in favor of Masterpiece would enable such businesses to have a "license to discriminate".&lt;ref name="econom" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/department-justice-s-gay-rights-brief-slammed-advocates-license-discriminate-n800316 | title = Department of Justice’s Gay Rights Brief Slammed by Advocates as ‘License to Discriminate’ | first = Julie | last = Moreau | date = September 11, 2017 | accessdate = September 11, 2017 | work = [[NBCNews]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oral arguments===
{{SCOTUS oral arguments|filename=Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission Oral Argument.mp3}}
Oral arguments for the plaintiffs were provided by Kristen Waggoner for the Alliance Defending Freedom, representing Phillips, and the [[Solicitor General of the United States]] [[Noel Francisco]], presenting the United States' government case as amicus curiae in support of Masterpiece Cakeshop. The defendants' arguments were given by Colorado Solicitor General Frederick Yarger, on behalf of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, and [[David D. Cole]] of the ACLU, on behalf of Craig and Mullins. Questions asked by the Justices attempted to determine where the bounds of a cake baker's rights and the rights of those soliciting his services would extend by considering several hypothetical situations involving the making of and selling custom cakes, including situations related to racial and gender-preference discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/supreme-court-cake-gay-rights-same-sex-colorado | title = Live Coverage: Supreme Court Hears Same-Sex Wedding Cake Case | date = December 5, 2017 | accessdate= December 5, 2017 | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts believed the Supreme Court's opinions in the case would be divided, with the ultimate decision falling on the opinion of [[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Anthony Kennedy]], who has historically been a swing vote in his term. In his past case history, he has been a strong supporter of gay rights (having authored all of the landmark gay rights rulings by the Supreme Court: ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'' in 1996, ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' in 2003, ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' in 2013, and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' in 2015), and a corporation's freedom of speech in his majority opinion for ''[[Citizens United v.

==Opinion of the Court==
===Majority opinion===
The Court issued its ruling on June 4, 2018, ordering a reversal of the decision made by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission. The majority opinion was written by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], and joined by Chief Justice [[John Roberts]], and Justices  [[Samuel Alito]], [[Stephen Breyer]], [[Elena Kagan]] and [[Neil Gorsuch]]. The opinion stated that although a baker, in his capacity as the owner of a business serving the public, "might have his right to the free exercise of his religion limited by generally applicable laws", a State decision in an adjudication “in which religious hostility on the part of the State itself” is a factor violates the "State’s obligation of religious neutrality" under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Slip op., pp. 2-3, ''Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission'', case no. 16-111, U.S. Supreme Court (June 4, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy's opinion stated that the Commission's review of Phillips' case exhibited hostility towards his religious views. The Commission compared Phillips' religious beliefs to defense of slavery or the [[Holocaust]]. Kennedy found such comparisons "inappropriate for a Commission charged with the solemn responsibility of fair and neutral enforcement of Colorado’s anti-discrimination law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2018/06/04/scotus-rules-bakers-opposed-to-gay-marriage-cant-be-forced-to-bake-cakes-n2487137 | title = Supreme Court Overwhelmingly Rules in Favor of Colorado Baker in Wedding Cake Case | first= Katie | last =Pavich | date = June 4, 2018 | accessdate = June 4, 2018 | work = [[Townhall]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy's opinion also cited the three exemptions the commission previously granted for the non-discrimination law arising from the William Jack complaints. The opinion also noted differences in handling previous exemptions as indicative of Commission hostility towards religious belief, rather than maintaining neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://reason.com/volokh/2018/06/04/the-masterpiece-cakeshop-decision-leaves | title = The Masterpiece Cakeshop Decision Leaves Almost All the Big Questions Unresolved | first =Eugene | last  = Volokh | date = June 4, 2018 | accessdate = June 4, 2018 | work = [[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy's opinion noted that he may have been inclined to rule in favor of the Commission if they had remained religiously neutral in their evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2018/06/04/in-bakers-case-neither-side-has-much-reason-to-rejoice/ | title = In baker’s case, neither side has much reason to rejoice | first = Jennifer | last =Rubin  |date = June 4, 2018 | accessdate = June 4, 2018 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concurring opinions===
Justice Kagan wrote a concurring opinion, joined by Breyer, taking particular notice of the narrow grounds of the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-supreme-court-wedding-cake-ruling-20180604-story.html |title=Supreme Court rules in favor of Colorado baker who wouldn't make same-sex wedding cake |last=Sherman |first=Mark |date=June 4, 2018 |work=chicagotribune.com |access-date=June 4, 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Gorsuch also wrote a concurring opinion, joined by Alito. Both Kagan's and Gorsuch's concurrence considered how the Commission handled Masterpiece differently than prior exemption requests. Kagan and Gorsuch concurrence agreed the Commission exhibited hostility towards Phillips' religious beliefs and concurred with the reversal. Kagan cited as significant differences between prior Commission exemptions and the instant case. She posited the Commission could have ruled differently in the two situations if they had stayed religiously-neutral. Gorsuch indicated the Commission should maintain consistency among similar cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cato.org/blog/masterpiece-cakeshop-ruling-tastes-good-empty-calories | title = Masterpiece Cakeshop Ruling Tastes Good, But Is Empty Calories | first=  Ilya | last= Sheppard | date = June 4, 2018 | accessdate = June 4, 2018  |work =[[The Cato Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote another opinion, concurring in part and concurring in judgment, joined by Gorsuch. Thomas found that the Majority opinion did not consider the [[Freedom of speech in the United States|free speech]], free exercise or anti-discrimination implications of the case, despite significant attention during oral arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/06/the-court-slices-a-narrow-ruling-out-of-masterpiece-cakeshop/561986/ | title = Justice Kennedy’s Masterpiece Ruling | first = Garrett | last = Epps |date = June 4, 2018 | accessdate = June 4, 2018 | work = [[The Atlantic]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes decision"/&gt; Thomas opined support for Masterpiece, both on grounds of free speech and free exercise.&lt;ref name="natrev"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/masterpiece-cakeshop-victory/ | title = Masterpiece Cakeshop Victory | first = Ed | last = Whelan | date = June 4, 2018 | accessdate = June 4, 2018 | work = [[National Review]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissenting opinions===
Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] wrote the dissenting opinion, joined by [[Sonia Sotomayor]]. Ginsburg believed that the Commission acted fairly in evaluating the case, saying "what critically differentiates them is the role the customer’s 'statutorily protected trait,' played in the denial of service".&lt;ref&gt;Slip op., pp. 2-3, ''Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission'', case no. 16-111, U.S. Supreme Court (June 4, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The Court avoided ruling broadly on the intersection of anti-discrimination laws and rights to free exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/us/politics/supreme-court-sides-with-baker-who-turned-away-gay-couple.html |title=Supreme Court Sides With Baker Who Turned Away Gay Couple |last=Liptak |first=Adam |date=June 4, 2018 |work=The New York Times |access-date=June 4, 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy's decision specifically noted the hostility towards Phillips made by the Commission as their reason to reverse the ruling, but because of the existence of this hostility in the current case, they could not rule on the broader issue regarding anti-discrimination law and the free exercise of religion. Kennedy stated that "[t]he outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts, all in the context of recognizing that these disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-colorado-baker-who-refused-to-make-wedding-cake-for-gay-couple-for-religious-reasons.html | title = Supreme Court rules narrowly for Colorado baker who wouldn't make same-sex wedding cake | publisher =  [[Reuters]] | via = [[CBS News]] |date = June 4, 2018 | accessdate = June 4, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-baker-who-would-not-make-wedding-cake-for-gay-couple/2018/06/04/50c68cf8-6802-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html | title = Supreme Court rules in favor of baker who would not make wedding cake for gay couple | first=  Robert | last= Barnes | date = June 4, 2018 | accessdate = June 4, 2018 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy's decision affirmed that there remains protection of same-sex couples and gay rights which states can still enforce through anti-discrimination laws, a point also agreed to by Ginsburg's dissent.&lt;ref name="nytimes decision"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/us/politics/supreme-court-sides-with-baker-who-turned-away-gay-couple.html | title=  Supreme Court Sides With Colorado Baker Who Turned Away Gay Couple | first = Adam | last =Liptak | date = June 4, 2018 | accessdate = June 4, 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The general constitutionality of anti-discrimination laws to prevent discrimination against sexual orientation affirmed by the ''Masterpiece'' decision was reflected in lower courts that same week, in a case decided by the [[Arizona Court of Appeals]], ''Brush &amp; Nib Studio v. Phoenix'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcourts.gov/Portals/0/OpinionFiles/Div1/2018/1%20CA-CV%2016-0602.pdf ''Brush &amp; Nib Studio v. Phoenix ''], No. 1 CA-CV 16-0602 (Ariz. Ct. App. June 7, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; which upheld the city of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]'s anti-discrimination ordinance that included sexual orientation. The Court of Appeals extensively quoted ''Masterpiece'' in affirming the [[Arizona Superior Court]]'s prior decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Court Applies Masterpiece Cakeshop Ruling to Uphold Ariz. LGBT Ordinance|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2018/06/07/court-applies-masterpiece-cakeshop-ruling-to-uphold-ariz-lgbt-ordinance/|website=Washington Blade|first=Chris|last=Johnson|date=June 7, 2018|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arizona Court Uses Cakeshop Case to Affirm LGBT Rights|url=https://www.advocate.com/politics/2018/6/08/arizona-court-uses-cakeshop-case-affirm-lgbt-rights|website=The Advocate|first=Trudy|last=Ring|date=June 8, 2018|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Sense of ''Masterpiece Cakeshop''|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/arizona-appeals-court-upholds-lgbtq-nondiscrimination-law-citing-masterpiece-cakeshop.html|website=Slate|first=Mark Joseph|last=Stern|date=June 7, 2018|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented Masterpiece, supported the Court's decision in finding that condemned the Commission's review of Phillips' case, stating that "Tolerance and respect for good-faith differences of opinion are essential in a society like ours".&lt;ref name="nytimes decision"/&gt; The American Civil Liberties Union welcomed the part of the decision affirming protection of gay rights, stating that the Court "reaffirmed its longstanding rule that states can prevent the harms of discrimination in the marketplace, including against L.G.B.T. people".&lt;ref name="nytimes decision"/&gt;

Another predominate case involving anti-discrimination laws and religious freedom that was in the court system during ''Masterpiece'' was the [[Arlene's Flowers lawsuit]] in Washington, with the issue over flower arrangements being provided for a same-sex wedding. Prior to the decision in ''Masterpiece'', a petition for writ of certorari had been issued to the Supreme Court. Following the decision of ''Masterpiece'', the flower shop owner used that decision to assert that they were shown similar religious hostility, and requested their case to be reheard. On June 25, 2018, the Supreme Court dismissed the pending petition, and ordered that lower courts review the flower shop's case in a similar light as ''Masterpiece''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/25/cake-flowers-supreme-court-wont-hear-new-same-sex-wedding-case/706187002/ | title = First cake, now flowers: Supreme Court gives florist who refused to serve gay wedding a new hearing | first = Richard | last = Wolf | date = June 25, 2018 | accessdate = June 25, 2018 | work = [[USA Today]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Masterpiece''{{'}}s basis of evaluating statements of public officials to determine if there was religious hostility in evaluating cases arose in Justice Sotomayor's dissent in ''[[Trump v. Hawaii]]'', {{ussc|585|___|2018}}, which dealt with President Trump's travel ban against several nations which had a high Muslim population. While the majority ruled that the ban was within the President's powers and sent the case back to lower courts to rule on other matters, Sotomayor believed that the decision of ''Masterpiece'' should have been used to judge President Trump and his administration's statements that she believed showed hostility towards Muslims and would have not justified the ban.&lt;ref name="HurdSchwartz"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.lawfareblog.com/supreme-court-travel-ban-ruling-summary | title = The Supreme Court Travel Ban Ruling: A Summary | first1 = Hilary | last1= Hurd |first2= Yishai  | last2= Schwartz | date = June 26, 2018 |accessdate = June 28, 2018 | work = [[Lawfare]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
{{See also|Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States}}
A nationwide and state-by-state poll on the issue conducted throughout 2017 by the [[Public Religion Research Institute]] as part of the annual ''American Values Atlas'' survey revealed that 60% of Americans, including a majority or plurality in every state, opposed allowing religiously-based refusals of services or products to gay people by small business owners (colloquially known as "the baker's exception"), while 33% supported allowing such religiously-based refusal, and 7% had no opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emerging Consensus on LGBT Issues: Findings From the 2017 American Values Atlas|url=https://www.prri.org/research/emerging-consensus-on-lgbt-issues-findings-from-the-2017-american-values-atlas/|website=[[Public Religion Research Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PRRI - American Values Atlas|url=http://ava.prri.org/#lgbt/2017/States/srvref/2,3,9|website=[[Public Religion Research Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Same-sex marriage has support among most American religious groups, study shows|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/opinion/same-sex-marriage-has-support-among-most-american-religious-groups-study-shows|website=[[National Catholic Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent events==
Masterpiece Cakeshop became involved in a similar case in 2018, stemming from an incident in June 2017.  The bakery refused to bake Autumn Scardina, a Colorado lawyer, a cake to celebrate her [[gender transition]], which would have had a pink interior and blue exterior.  Philips stated later that he refused to bake such a cake based on his Christian beliefs that one does not get to choose their gender.  Scardina complained to the Colorado Division of Civil Rights, which found in June 2018 sufficient evidence that the bakery discriminated against her transgender status, and ordered the parties into compulsory mediation.  Philips subsequently filed a lawsuit against the state in August 2018 to seek a permanent injunction to prevent the state from enforcing its anti-discrimination laws against him as well as punitive damages.  Colorado Governor [[John Hickenlooper]], who is named as a defendant in the suit, expects that the case will require the Supreme Court to revisit its decision from ''Masterpiece'', as the previous ruling "did not address the basic issue" of religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.denverpost.com/2018/08/15/masterpiece-cakeshop-hickenlooper-lawsuit/ | title = Masterpiece Cakeshop owner sues Hickenlooper, claiming religious persecution despite Supreme Court ruling | first1 = Nic | last1 =Garcia | first2 = Kirk |last2= Mitchell | date = August 15, 2018 | accessdate = August 16, 2018 | work = [[The Denver Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/2018/08/16/639147599/colorado-baker-sues-state-again-after-refusing-to-make-cake-for-transgender-woma | title = Colorado Baker Sues State Again, After Refusing To Make Cake For Transgender Woman | first = James | last =Doubek | date = August 16, 2018 | accessdate = August 16, 2018 | work = [[NPR]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Niagara Falls peace conference''', sometimes referred to as the '''ABC Conference''', started on May 20, 1914, when representatives from [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Chile]]—the [[ABC Powers]]—met in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], [[Canada]], for [[diplomatic negotiations]] in order to avoid war between the United States and Mexico, during the era of the [[Mexican Revolution]].&lt;ref name=small/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Bulletins from Peace Meeting Eagerly Read by the Crowds |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50916FE345D13738DDDA80A94DD405B848DF1D3 |quote='Play Ball' sang out an irreverent voice as Frederick W.

==History==
There were increasing tensions between the two over the  [[Tampico Affair]] of April 9, 1914 and the subsequent [[United States occupation of Veracruz]] of April 21, 1914 during the [[Mexican Revolution]].&lt;ref name=forget&gt;{{cite book|last1=Small|first1=Michael|title=The Forgotten Peace: Mediation at Niagara Falls|page=32|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10393/19619|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican and American governments had severed all diplomatic channels between one another.&lt;ref name=forget/&gt; At the conference, [[Domício da Gama]] represented Brazil, [[Rómulo Sebastián Naón]] represented Argentina, and [[Eduardo Suárez Mujica]] represented Chile.

The United States was represented by [[Frederick William Lehmann]], a former [[United States Solicitor General]]; and [[Joseph Rucker Lamar]], an [[Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].&lt;ref name="why" /&gt;&lt;ref name="small"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Michael Small (diplomat)|Michael Small]] |coauthors= |title=The Forgotten Peace: Mediation at Niagara Falls |year=2009 |publisher=[[University of Ottawa Press]] |page= |quote= | url= |isbn=0-7766-0712-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 27, 1914 to celebrate their success, the ABC envoys and the U.S. and Mexican delegates to the conference attended a royal garden party given by the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]], the [[Governor General of Canada]] at the [[King Edward Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Governor General and Duchess Give Garden Party for Them in Toronto |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60814F93C5E13738DDDA10A94DD405B848DF1D3 |quote=A B C envoys and American and Mexican delegates to the Niagara Falls peace conference, together with their wives and daughters, secretaries and attaches, invaded Toronto today to attend the royal garden party given by the Duke of Connaught, [[Governor General of Canada]]; the Duchess of Connaught, Sir John Gibson, Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, and Lady Gibson. |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=May 28, 1914 |accessdate=2011-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 1915 three South American diplomats received the [[Thanks of Congress]] and were awarded [[Congressional Gold Medal]]s (P.L. 63-75, 38 Stat. 1228). The statute reads as follows.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the thanks of Congress to their excellencies be, and they are hereby, presented to their excellencies Señor Domício da Gama, Señor Rómulo S. Naón, and Señor Eduardo Suárez for their generous services as mediators in the controversy between the Government of the United States of America and the leaders of the warring parties in the Republic of Mexico. That the President of the United States is hereby authorized and requested to cause to be made and presented to their excellencies Señor Domicio da Gama, Señor Rómulo S. Naón, and Señor Eduardo Suárez suitable gold medals, appropriately inscribed, which shall express the high estimation in which Congress holds the services of these distinguished statesmen, and the Republics which they represent, in the promotion of peace and order in the American continent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Organization of American States''' ({{lang-es|Organización de los Estados Americanos}}, {{lang-pt|Organização dos Estados Americanos}}, {{lang-fr|Organisation des États américains}}), or the '''OAS''' or '''OEA''', is a continental [[organization]] that was founded on 30 April 1948, for the purposes of regional solidarity and cooperation among its member states.  Headquartered in the [[United States]] capital [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref&gt;Coordinates of OAS headquarters: {{coord|38.8929138|-77.0403734|format=dms|type:landmark|name=OAS headquarters, Washington, D.C.|display=inline,title}}&lt;/ref&gt; the OAS's members are the 35 independent states of the [[Americas]].

As of 26 May 2015, the [[Secretary General of the Organization of American States|Secretary General of OAS]] is [[Luis Almagro]].&lt;ref name="Miami Herald"&gt;{{cite web|last1=WYSS|first1=JIM|title=As a Uruguayan is poised to head the OAS, questions swirl about Venezuela  |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/article15196958.html|website=Miami Herald|publisher=Miami Herald|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2018}}&lt;!--very few citations--&gt;
[[File:Pan american 1900.jpg|thumb|left|The Pan American Union shortly after its construction in 1910]]
The notion of an international union in the [[New World]] was first put forward by [[Simón Bolívar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Panama: A Country Study |publisher=Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1987|url=http://countrystudies.us/panama/4.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; who, at the 1826 [[Congress of Panama]] (still being part of Colombia), proposed creating a league of American republics, with a common military, a mutual defense pact, and a supranational parliamentary assembly. This meeting was attended by representatives of [[Gran Colombia]] (comprising the modern-day countries of [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Panama]] and  [[Venezuela]]), [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], The [[United Provinces of Central America]], and [[Mexico]] but the grandly titled "Treaty of Union, League, and Perpetual Confederation" was ultimately ratified only by Gran Colombia. Bolívar's dream soon floundered with civil war in Gran Colombia, the disintegration of Central America, and the emergence of [[Nationalism|national]] rather than New World outlooks in the newly independent American republics. Bolívar's dream of American unity was meant to unify Hispanic American nations against external powers.

The pursuit of regional solidarity and cooperation again came to the forefront in 1889–1890, at the First [[International Conference of American States]]. Gathered together in Washington, D.C., 18 nations resolved to found the International Union of American Republics, served by a permanent secretariat called the Commercial Bureau of the American Republics (renamed the International Commercial Bureau at the Second International Conference in 1901–1902). These two bodies, in existence as of 14 April 1890, represent the point of inception to which the OAS and its General Secretariat trace their origins.

At the Fourth [[International Conference of American States]] ([[Buenos Aires]], 1910), the name of the organization was changed to the Union of American Republics and the Bureau became the Pan American Union. The [[Pan American Union Building]] was constructed in 1910, on [[Constitution Avenue]], [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.]]

[[File:Pan American Union, Washington, DC in 1943.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pan American Union Building|Pan American Union headquarters building]] in Washington, D.C., 1943.]]
In the mid-1930s, U.S. President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] organized an inter-American conference in Buenos Aires. One of the items at the conference was a "[[League of Nations]] of the Americas", an idea proposed by Colombia, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Special to the New York Times. [https://www.nytimes.com/1936/04/13/archives/league-of-nations-in-americas-urged-by-3-latin-states-this-is-one.html?sq=League+of+nations+in+Americas&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p "League of Nations in Americas urged by 3 Latin states"], ''The New York Times''. April 13, 1936. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; At the subsequent Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Peace, 21 nations pledged to remain neutral in the event of a conflict between any two members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1936/12/20/archives/americas-adopt-neutrality-pact-21-nations-pledge-a-joint-attitude.html?sq=League+of+nations+in+Americas&amp;scp=6&amp;st=p "Americas adopt neutrality pact"], ''The New York Times''. December 20, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of [[World War II]] convinced hemispheric governments that unilateral action could not ensure the territorial integrity of the American nations in the event of external aggression. To meet the challenges of global conflict in the postwar world and to contain conflicts within the hemisphere, they adopted a system of [[collective security]], the [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance]] (Rio Treaty) signed in 1947 in [[Rio de Janeiro]].

The Ninth [[International Conference of American States]] was held in [[Bogotá]] between March and May 1948 and led by [[United States Secretary of State]] [[George Marshall]], a meeting which led to a pledge by members to fight communism in the [[western hemisphere]]. This was the event that saw the birth of the OAS as it stands today, with the signature by 21 American countries of the [[Charter of the Organization of American States]] on 30 April 1948 (in effect since December 1951). The meeting also adopted the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]], the world's first general human rights instrument.

The transition from the Pan American Union to OAS would have been smooth if it had not been for the assassination of Colombian leader [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]]. The Director General of the former, [[Alberto Lleras Camargo]], became the Organization's first [[Secretary General of the Organization of American States|Secretary General]]. The current Secretary General is former Uruguayan minister of foreign affairs [[Luis Almagro]].

Significant milestones in the history of the OAS since the signing of the Charter have included the following:

*1959: [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] created.
*1959: [[Inter-American Development Bank]] created.
*1960: First application of the [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance]] against the regime of [[Rafael Trujillo]] in [[Dominican Republic]]
*1961: Charter of Punta del Este signed, launching the [[Alliance for Progress]].
*1962: OAS suspends [[Cuba]].
*1969: [[American Convention on Human Rights]] signed (in force since 1978).
*1970: [[General Assembly of the Organization of American States|OAS General Assembly]] established as the Organization's supreme decision-making body.
*1979: [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] created.
*1991: Adoption of Resolution 1080, which requires the Secretary General to convene the [[Permanent Council of the Organization of American States|Permanent Council]] within ten days of a [[coup d'état]] in any member country.
*1994: First [[Summit of the Americas]] ([[Miami]]), which resolved to establish a [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] by 2005.
*2001: [[Inter-American Democratic Charter]] adopted.
*2009: OAS revokes 1962 suspension of [[Cuba]].
*2009: OAS suspends Honduras due to the [[2009 Honduran coup d'état|coup]] which ousted president [[Manuel Zelaya]].
*2011: OAS lifts the suspension of Honduras with the return of Manuel Zelaya from exile.
*2017: [[Venezuela]] announces it will begin the process to leave the OAS in response to what it alleged was OAS interference in [[Crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela|Venezuela's political crisis]].

== Goals and purpose ==

In the words of Article 1 of the Charter, the goal of the member nations in creating the OAS was "to achieve an order of peace and justice, to promote their solidarity, to strengthen their collaboration, and to defend their sovereignty, their territorial integrity, and their independence." Article 2 then defines eight essential purposes:
*To strengthen the [[world peace|peace]] and security of the continent.
*To promote and consolidate [[representative democracy]], with due respect for the [[principle of non-intervention]].
*To prevent possible causes of difficulties and to ensure the pacific settlement of disputes that may arise among the member states.
*To provide for common action on the part of those states in the event of aggression.
*To seek the solution of political, judicial, and economic problems that may arise among them.
*To promote, by cooperative action, their [[right to development|economic, social, and cultural development]].
*To [[poverty reduction|eradicate extreme poverty]], which constitutes an obstacle to the full democratic development of the peoples of the hemisphere.
*To achieve an effective limitation of conventional weapons that will make it possible to devote the largest amount of resources to the economic and social development of the member states.

Over the course of the 1990s, with the end of the [[Cold War]], the return to democracy in [[Latin America]], and the thrust toward [[globalization]], the OAS made major efforts to reinvent itself to fit the new context. Its stated priorities now include the following:

*Strengthening democracy: Between 1962 and 2002, the Organization sent multinational observation missions to oversee free and fair elections in the member states on more than 100 occasions. The OAS also works to strengthen national and local government and electoral agencies, to promote democratic practices and values, and to help countries detect and defuse official corruption.
*Working for peace: Special OAS missions have supported peace processes in [[Nicaragua]], [[Suriname]], [[Haiti]], and [[Guatemala]]. The Organization has played a leading part in the removal of landmines deployed in member states and it has led negotiations to resolve the continents' remaining border disputes ([[Guatemala]]/[[Belize]]; [[Peru]]/[[Ecuador]]). Work is also underway on the construction of a common inter-American counter-terrorism front.
*[[Human rights defenders|Defending human rights]]: The agencies of the inter-American human rights system provide a venue for the denunciation and resolution of human rights violations in individual cases. They also monitor and report on the general human rights situation in the member states.
*Fostering free trade: The OAS is one of the three agencies currently engaged in drafting a treaty aiming to establish an [[Free Trade Area of the Americas|inter-continental free trade area]] from [[Alaska]] to [[Tierra del Fuego]].
*Fighting the drugs trade: The Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission was established in 1986 to coordinate efforts and crossborder cooperation in this area.
*Promoting [[sustainable development]]: The goal of the OAS's Inter-American Council for Integral Development is to promote economic development and combating poverty. OAS technical cooperation programs address such areas as river basin management, the conservation of biodiversity, preservation of cultural diversity, planning for global climate change, [[sustainable tourism]], and natural disaster mitigation.

== Organizational structure ==

The Organization of American States is composed of an Organization of American States General Secretariat, the Permanent Council, the Inter-American Council for Integral Development, and a number of committees.

The General Secretariat of the Organization of American States consists of six [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariats]].
*[[Organization of American States Secretariat for Political Affairs|Secretariat for Political Affairs]]
*[[Executive Secretary for Integral Development|Executive Secretariat for Integral Development]]
*[[Organization of American States Secretariat for Multidimensional Security|Secretariat for Multidimensional Security]]
*Secretariat for Administration and Finance
*Secretariat for Legal Affairs
*Secretariat for External Relations

The various committees of the Organization of American States include:

* The Committee on Juridical and Political Affairs
* The Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Affairs
* The Committee on Hemispheric Security
* The Committee on Inter-American Summits Management and Civil Society Participation in OAS Activities

== General Assembly ==
[[File:Organization of American States General Assembly.jpg|thumb|right|A session of the OAS's thirty-fifth General Assembly in [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]], [[United States]], June 2005.]]
{{main|General Assembly of the Organization of American States}}
The [[General Assembly of the Organization of American States|General Assembly]] is the supreme decision-making body of OAS. It convenes once every year in a regular session. In special circumstances, and with the approval of two-thirds of the member states, the [[Permanent Council of the Organization of American States|Permanent Council]] can convene special sessions.

The Organization's member states take turns hosting the General Assembly on a rotating basis. The states are represented at its sessions by their chosen delegates: generally, their ministers of foreign affairs, or their appointed deputies. Each state has one vote, and most matters—except for those for which the Charter or the General Assembly's own rules of procedure specifically require a two-thirds majority—are settled by a simple majority vote.

The General Assembly's powers include setting the OAS's general course and policies by means of resolutions and declarations; approving its budget and determining the contributions payable by the member states; approving the reports and previous year's actions of the OAS's specialized agencies; and electing members to serve on those agencies.

=== Canada and the OAS ===
Although Canada has been a founding member of the [[League of Nations]] in 1919&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/league-of-nations/ The Canadian Encyclopedia - League of Nations] &lt;/ref&gt; and has joined international organizations since that date, it chose not to join the OAS when it was first formed, despite its [[Canada-United States relations|close relations with the United States]]. Canada became a Permanent Observer in the OAS on 2 February 1972. Canada signed the Charter of the Organization of American States on 13 November 1989 and this decision was ratified on 8 January 1990.

In 2004–2005, Canada was the second largest contributor to the OAS, with an annual assessed contribution representing 12.36 percent of the OAS Regular Budget (US$9.2 million) and an additional C$9 million in voluntary contributions to specific projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geo.international.gc.ca/cip-pic/geo/oas-oae-en.aspx Canada and the Organization of American States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123015807/http://geo.international.gc.ca/cip-pic/geo/oas-oae-en.aspx |date=2009-01-23 }}, Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada (DFAIT), 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1967/sep-oct/kos.html Canada and the Organization of American States] by Dr. Ludwil J.

=== Sanctions against the Dominican Republic ===
During the 6th Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Organization of American States (OAS) in [[Costa Rica]], from 16 to 20 August 1960, a conviction against the State of the Dominican Republic was agreed to unanimously. The penalty was motivated because the foreign ministers checked the veracity of the claim that the [[Rafael Trujillo]] regime had sponsored an attack against [[Rómulo Betancourt]], at that time, constitutional president of Venezuela. The meeting was attended by foreign ministers from 21 American nations, including [[Cuba]], which at that time had not yet been expelled from the inter-American system.

All countries, including the [[United States]] and [[Haiti]] broke off diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic. Additionally an economic blockade that affected the exports of sugar was applied, which at that time was the pillar of the Dominican economy.

It was the first application of the [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance]], which had been adopted at the OAS on July 29, 1960.

=== Status of Cuba ===
{{further|Cuba–OAS relations}}
The current government of Cuba was excluded from participation in the Organization under a decision adopted by the Eighth Meeting of Consultation in [[Punta del Este]], [[Uruguay]], on 31 January 1962. The vote was passed by 14 in favor, with one against (Cuba) and six abstentions (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, and Mexico). The operative part of the resolution reads as follows:

{{quote|
#That adherence by any member of the Organization of American States to Marxism-Leninism is incompatible with the inter-American system and the alignment of such a government with the communist bloc breaks the unity and solidarity of the continents.
#That the present Government of Cuba, which has officially identified itself as a Marxist-Leninist government, was incompatible with the principles and objectives of the inter-American system.
#That this incompatibility excluded the present Government of Cuba from participation in the inter-American system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Six Report on the Situation of Political Prisoners in Cuba |work=[[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] |publisher=Organization of American States |date=1979-12-14 |url=http://www.cidh.oas.org/countryrep/Cuba79eng/intro.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

This meant that the Cuban nation was still technically a member state, but that the current government was denied the right of representation and attendance at meetings and of participation in activities. The OAS's position was that although Cuba's participation was suspended, its obligations under the Charter, the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]], etc. still hold: for instance, the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] continued to publish reports on Cuba's human rights situation and to hear individual cases involving Cuban nationals. However, this stance was occasionally questioned by other individual member states.

Cuba's position was stated in an official note sent to the Organization "merely as a courtesy" by Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. [[Raúl Roa]] on 4 November 1964: "Cuba was arbitrarily excluded... The Organization of American States has no juridical, factual, or moral jurisdiction, nor competence, over a state which it has illegally deprived of its rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Situation of Human Rights in Cuba: Seventh Report |work=[[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] |publisher=Organization of American States |date=1983-10-04 |url=http://www.cidh.oas.org/countryrep/Cuba83eng/intro.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reincorporation of Cuba as an active member regularly arose as a topic within the inter-American system{{spaced ndash}} for instance, it was intimated by the outgoing ambassador of Mexico in 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Mexico Calls for Cuba's Reinstatement into the OAS |publisher=Organization of American States |date=1998-02-04 |url=http://www.oas.org/OASpage/press2002/en/Press98/020498ce.htm}} Organization of American States.&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}but most observers did not see it as a serious possibility while the present government remained in power. Since 1960, the Cuban administration had repeatedly characterized the OAS as the "Ministry of Colonies" of the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,869814,00.html |title=The Testing of the OAS |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1960-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/castro/db/1972/19720426.html |title=Castro admits problems in education |work=Siempre |publisher=Latin American Network Information Center, University of Texas at Austin |first=Marta |last=Solis |date=1972-04-26 |pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 May 2005, President [[Fidel Castro]] reiterated that the island nation would not "be part of a disgraceful institution that has only humiliated the honor of Latin American nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B2355B35C-068E-4DFE-879E-3E8836A38EA4%7D&amp;language=EN |title=Fidel Castro: OAS Is an Instrument of the US |work=[[Prensa Latina]] |location=Havana, Cuba |date=2006-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011190122/http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B2355B35C-068E-4DFE-879E-3E8836A38EA4%7D&amp;language=EN |archivedate=2008-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Fidel Castro's recent retirement and the ascent of his brother [[Raúl Castro|Raúl]] to power, this official position was reasserted. [[President of Venezuela|Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Chávez]] promised to veto any final declaration of the 2009 [[Summit of the Americas]] due to Cuba's exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8003507.stm |title=Chavez threatens veto over Cuba |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=2009-04-17 |accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 2009, after a "trading of warm words" between the administrations of U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raúl Castro, OAS Secretary General [[José Miguel Insulza]] said he would ask the 2009 General Assembly to annul the 1962 resolution excluding Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30261514/ |title=U.S., Cuba trade warm words ahead of summit |work=[[msnbc.com]] |date=2009-04-17 |accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June 2009, foreign ministers assembled in [[San Pedro Sula]], [[Honduras]], for the OAS's 39th [[General Assembly of the Organization of American States|General Assembly]], passed a vote to lift Cuba's suspension from the OAS. The United States had been pressuring the OAS for weeks to condition Cuba's readmission to the group on democratic principles and commitment to human rights. Ecuador's Foreign Minister [[Fander Falconí]] said there will be no such conditions. "This is a new proposal, it has no conditions—of any kind," Falconí said. "That suspension was made in the [[Cold War]], in the language of the Cold War. What we have done here is fix a historic error."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/459/story/1079796.html |title=OAS votes to lift suspension of Cuba |work=[[The Miami Herald]] |date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2009-06-03}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspension was lifted at the end of the General Assembly, but, to be readmitted to the Organization, Cuba will need to comply with all the treaties signed by the Member States, including the Inter-American Democratic Charter of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oas.org/consejo/GENERAL%20ASSEMBLY/Documents/AG04688E08.doc&lt;/ref&gt;  A statement issued by the Cuban government on 8 June 2009 stated that while Cuba welcomed the Assembly's gesture, in light of the Organization's historical record "Cuba will not return to the OAS."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2009/junio/lun8/Declaration.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219170708/http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2009/junio/lun8/Declaration.html|archivedate=2012-02-19|title=Declaration of the Revolutionary Government |work=[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]] |date=2009-06-08 |accessdate=2009-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suspension of Honduras (2009–2011) ===
[[File:Suspensión de Honduras de la OEA.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Those attending the Extraordinary Assembly of the OAS voted to suspend Honduras.]]

== Official languages ==
[[File:Socha Izabely I Katolickej.JPG|thumb|Statue of Isabella I the Catholic in front of the seat of the Organization of American States in Washington D.C.]]
The Organization's [[List of official languages by institution|official languages]] are [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]. The Charter, the basic instrument governing OAS, makes no reference to the use of official languages. These references are to be found in the Rules of Procedure governing the various OAS bodies. Article 51 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly,&lt;ref&gt;General Assembly of the OAS, [http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/agres_1737_xxxo00.htm Amendments to the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly], 5 June 2000&lt;/ref&gt; the supreme body of the OAS, which meets once a year, states that English, French, Portuguese and Spanish are the four official languages. Article 28 stipulates that a Style Committee shall be set up with representatives of the four official languages to review the General Assembly resolutions and declarations. Article 53 states that proposals shall be presented in the four official languages. The Rules of Procedure and Statutes of other bodies, such as the Inter-American Council for Integral Development (CIDI), the Permanent Executive Committee of the Inter-American Council for Integral Development (CEPCIDI), the [[Inter-American Commission of Women]] (CIM), the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD), the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (IACHR) and the Inter-American Juridical Committee (CJI), technical bodies of the OAS, also mention the four official languages in which their meetings are to be conducted. Policy is therefore dictated through these instruments that require use of the four official languages at meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Marguerite Groves (Coordinator, Division of Language Services, OAS), [http://www.cslf.gouv.qc.ca/Seminaire/Conferences/MargueriteGroves.doc Information on the use of language at the OAS: multilingualism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203222344/http://www.cslf.gouv.qc.ca/Seminaire/Conferences/MargueriteGroves.doc |date=February 3, 2007 }}, ''Inter-American Languages Management Seminar'', [[Conseil supérieur de la langue française (Quebec)|Conseil supérieur de la langue française]] ([[Quebec]]), [[Quebec City]], 20 to 22 August  2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a number of other languages have official status in one or more member states of OAS ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] in Suriname; [[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]] alongside French in Haiti; [[Quechua language|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] in Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia; [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] in Paraguay), they are not official languages of the Organization.

{{Politics of the Netherlands}}
The '''Peasants' League''' (in Dutch: ''Plattelandersbond'', PB) was a [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch]] [[agrarianism|agrarian]] [[political party]]. The League played only a minor role in Dutch politics.

==Party History==
The party was founded on February 17, 1917. In the [[Dutch general election, 1918|elections of 1918]] the party won one seat. It had campaigned with two lists, one religious list and one secular list, in order to appeal to both religious and secular farmers. During the [[First World War]] the Netherlands, a neutral country, had to rely on its own agriculture. Government influence in agriculture had increased, to the unhappiness of many farmers. The party's seat was taken by [[Frederik Bos]]. Between 1918 and 1919 the League cooperated in the neutral parliamentary party, with other four one or two seat parties, namely the [[Alliance for the Democratisation of the Army]], the [[Economic League (Netherlands)|Economic League]], the [[Middle Class Party]] and the [[Neutral Party]]. The parliamentary party was led by former minister [[Willem Treub]]. In 1919 Bos was replaced by [[Arend Braat]] as member of parliament. Braat was an unsophisticated and unconventional MP, who attempted to revoke the law on [[daylight saving time]] on five occasions but failed in each. He was ignored by most other politicians and scorned by the media for his unsophisticated behaviour. He immediately left the neutral parliamentary party.

In the [[Dutch general election, 1922|elections of 1922]] the party won an additional seat, this is partially explained by Braat's unconventional behaviour, which appealed the rural voters. The party's second MP De Boer tried to replace Braat as party leader. He was removed from the party ranks and participated in the [[Dutch general election, 1925|1925 elections]]. Braat lost his second seat, but De Boer was unable to win a seat. After the [[Dutch general election, 1929|1929 election]] the leadership of Braat became even more contested. Because of his aggressive strategy against supporters of De Boer the party's organisation was not functioning well. Before the [[Dutch general election, 1933|1933]] elections the party changed its name to '''National Farmers', Horticulturists' and Middle Class Party''' (''Nationale Boeren-, Tuinders- en Middenstandspartij'', NBTM) and renewed its party organisations. In this election it had two [[Lijsttrekker|top candidates]] Cornelis Vervoorn, a rich farmer, for the Northern provinces [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] and [[Drenthe]] and Arend Braat, who been the party's leader for a long time, for the rest of the Netherlands. Unexpectedly Vervoorn was elected into parliament because he received more votes than Braat. Braat tried to convince Vervoorn to give up his seat, but he refused.  In the [[Dutch general election, 1937|1937 election]] the party lost its seat, this is partially explained by the rise of the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|National Socialist Movement]], which was linked to a strong agrarian organisation ''Agriculture and Society''

==Ideology &amp; Issues==
The party advocated the interests of farmers and tried to fight the disadvantaged position of rural communities. The party saw agriculture as the primary source of wealth of the Netherlands. Its main goal was to ensure a reasonable income for farmers, to expand the farming sector and protect [[property|property rights]]. It wanted to abolish [[Daylight saving time]], reduce taxation and government interference, found a ministry of agriculture, implement an old age pension, improve agricultural education, and end the merger of municipalities. The change of name in 1933 to National Farmers', Horticulturists' and Middle Class Party also implied an ideological reorientation. The party now also oriented towards the middle class in urban areas, while still holding on to its agrarian ideals. Small businesses, the middle class, were seen as the link between farmers and consumers. It added several proposals to its party manifesto such as a cheaper supply of credit and the regulation of advertisements.

==Leadership &amp; Support==
This table shows the Peasants' League's results in elections to the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] and [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]], as well as the party's political leadership: the fractievoorzitter, is the chair of the parliamentary party and the lijsttrekker is the party's top candidate in the general election, these posts are normally taken by the party's leader.

==Electorate==
The electorate of party consisted out of farmers form [[Drenthe]], [[Gelderland]], the [[West Friesland (region)|northern region]] of [[North Holland]] and the [[South Holland#Islands|southern islands]] of [[South Holland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1588">'''Pension Term Assurance''' (PTA) was a form of life insurance available within the [[United Kingdom]]. Although PTA had been available for several years, it only became mainstream when changes were made to pension legislation on "A Day", 6 April 2006.
Following these changes, PTA became a popular way of buying life insurance, as the premiums received tax relief, effectively making life insurance cheaper for the consumer. 

However, on 6 December 2006 the UK Government announced an important review of Pension Term Assurance (PTA). The Treasury indicated it was not happy with the PTA products on offer, and effectively stopped any more new PTA business being written. Those with existing policies were allowed to keep them running.

Despite what the name might suggest, Pension Term Assurance did not have to form part of a pension - it merely needed to be taken out at the same time as a new pension was set up.

The '''Pensioners' Party''' ({{lang-no|Pensjonistpartiet}}) is a [[List of political parties in Norway|political party in Norway]] without parliamentary representation. It was founded in 1985 to work for the interests of [[pensioner]]s, and the party mainly focuses on issues related to health care, taxes and pensioners' issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://snl.no/Pensjonistpartiet&lt;/ref&gt;

The party has never been elected to parliament, although former MP [[Arne Haukvik]], who was elected on the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] (Sp) list in 1993, joined the party prior to the 1997 election after he was not renominated by the Sp. The party has representatives in the local councils of some cities and county assemblies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1905">'''Restrictions on political parties''' have existed in many countries at various times. In [[Uganda]], for instance, political parties were restricted in their activities from 1986; in the non-party "Movement" system instituted by Museveni, political parties continued to exist but could not campaign in elections or field candidates directly (although electoral candidates could belong to political parties). A [[Ugandan multi-party referendum, 2005|constitutional referendum]] cancelled this 19-year ban on multi-party politics in July 2005.

The short film presents deep insight into both the Chinese and North Korean societies and changes that have taken place over the last several decades.  First person interviews add depth to the local perceptions of life on both sides of the border.  Footage of life along the North Korean border and the mistrust of foreigners by the North Korean people is vividly displayed.

The spoiler effect is a problem in [[plurality voting system]]s because they enable a candidate to win with less than half of the vote.

The problem also exists in [[Instant-runoff voting#Spoiler effect|instant-runoff voting]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_24bJHyBV6sC|title=Gaming the Vote: Why Elections Aren't Fair (and What We Can Do About It)|last=Poundstone|first=William|date=2009-02-17|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=9781429957649|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=IRV is excellent for preventing classic spoilers-minor candidates who irrationally tip the election from one major candidate to another.

Other [[Ranked voting systems|preferential voting]] or ranked ballot voting systems also suffer from variations of the spoiler effect, as they fail the IIA criterion (see [[#Mathematical definitions|§Mathematical definitions]]).

The problem does not exist in [[cardinal voting methods]] like [[approval voting]], [[score voting]], or [[majority judgment]], since the rating of each candidate is independent of the ratings of other candidates.

==Relationship with other effects==
The spoiler candidate takes votes away from a more viable{{#tag:ref|More viable by common public sentiment which may sometimes be indicated in [[opinion poll]]s.|group= n}} candidate or candidates, a common effect called [[vote splitting]].  Where one opposing candidate is [[ideology|ideologically]] or [[politics|politically]] similar and therefore receives far fewer votes than other opposing candidates to the spoiler candidate, then the vote splitting has a spoiler effect.

In some cases, even though the spoiler candidate cannot win themselves, their influences upon the voters may enable the candidate to determine deliberately which of the more viable candidates wins the election — a situation known as a [[kingmaker scenario]].  With a [[first-past-the-post voting]] system, this is particularly feasible where a spoiler candidate recommends [[tactical voting]] or runs on a false [[political manifesto|manifesto]] to bolster the prospects of their secretly preferred winning candidate.

In a [[Ranked voting systems|preferential voting]] system, a voter can feel more inclined to vote for a minor party or independent as their first choice and they can record a preference between the remaining candidates, whether they are in a major or established [[political party|party]] or not. For example, voters for a minor [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] candidate might select a major left-wing candidate as their second choice, thus minimizing the probability that their vote will result in the election of a [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] candidate, or voters for an independent candidate perceived as libertarian, or simply as the voter prefers that ideology might select a particular [[libertarianism|libertarian]] candidate as their second choice, thus minimising the probability of an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] candidate being elected. [[Approval voting]] and [[proportional representation]] systems can also reduce the spoiler effect.

One of the main functions of political parties is to mitigate the effect of spoiler-prone voting methods by winnowing on a local level the contenders before the election. Each party nominates at most one candidate per office since each party expects to lose if they nominate more than one.{{#tag:ref|For example, if the Democrats had nominated both [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] for U.S. President in 2008, it would have allowed the Republican candidate (John McCain) to easily win; the voters who preferred both Clinton and Obama over McCain could not have been relied on to solve the strategy coordination problem on their own.|group= n}} In some cases, a party can expect to "lose" by "suffering a rival elected opponent" if they nominate more than zero, where two opponents exist and one is considered a candidate they can "work with" — a party may prefer the candidate who would win if the party nominates zero.{{#tag:ref|For example, in the United Kingdom, [[United Kingdom Independence Party|UKIP]] have a policy of not standing parliamentary candidates where the incumbent is a committed eurosceptic member of the large [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]; however, one rebel spoiler candidate from the party, Jake Baynes, led to the defeat of [[David Heathcoat-Amory]] in [[Wells (UK Parliament constituency)|Wells]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010]] by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)]].|group= n}}

Thus, empirical observations of the frequency of spoiled elections do not provide a good measure of how prone to spoiling a particular voting method is, since the observations omit the relevant information about potential candidates who did not run because of not wanting to spoil the election.

==Mathematical definitions==
{{details|topic=the mathematics of elections|Decision theory|Social choice theory}}

Possible mathematical definitions for the spoiler effect include failure of the [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] (IIA) axiom, and vote splitting.

[[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that rank-voting systems are unable to satisfy the [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] criterion without exhibiting other undesirable properties as a consequence. However, different [[voting system]]s are affected to a greater or lesser extent by IIA failure. For example, [[Instant-runoff voting|instant runoff voting]] is considered to have less frequent IIA failure than [[First Past the Post]] (also known as [[Plurality voting system|Plurality Rule]]). The [[independence of Smith-dominated alternatives]] (ISDA) criterion is much weaker than IIA; unlike IIA, some ranked-ballot voting methods can pass ISDA.

A possible definition of spoiling based on vote splitting is as follows: Let W denote the candidate who wins the election, and let X and S denote two other candidates. If X would have won had S not been one of the nominees, and if (most of) the voters who prefer S over W also prefer X over W (either S&gt;X&gt;W or X&gt;S&gt;W), then S is a spoiler. Here is an example to illustrate: Suppose the voters' orders of preference are as follows:

{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"
| 33%: S&gt;X&gt;W
| 15%: X&gt;S&gt;W
| 17%: X&gt;W&gt;S
| 35%: W&gt;X&gt;S
|}

The voters who prefer S over W also prefer X over W. W is the winner under Plurality Rule, Top Two Runoff, and Instant Runoff. If S is deleted from the votes (so that the 33% who ranked S on top now rank X on top) then X would be the winner (by 65% landslide majority). Thus S is a spoiler with these three voting methods.

== Spoiler effect in American elections ==
A 2014 analysis by Philip Bump for ''the Washington Post'' found that 1.5% of general election races in the U.S. from 2006 to 2012 were spoiled by third-party candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/10/08/how-often-do-third-party-candidates-actually-spoil-elections-not-very/ | title=How often do third-party candidates actually spoil elections? Almost never. | publisher=[[The Washington Post]] | work=The Fix | date=8 October 2014 | accessdate=17 May 2017 | author=Bump, Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presidential elections ===

Historically, the Democratic and Republican parties have benefited from the alleged spoiler effect created by the existing U.S. [[plurality voting system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/05/us/1992-elections-disappointment-analysis-eccentric-but-no-joke-perot-s-strong.html|title=THE 1992 ELECTIONS: DISAPPOINTMENT -- NEWS ANALYSIS An Eccentric but No Joke; Perot's Strong Showing Raises Questions On What Might Have Been, and Might Be|date=November 5, 1992|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nader-to-crash-dems-party/&lt;/ref&gt; This benefit is based in the theory that not voting for other parties and for independents and that third parties and independent candidates themselves declining to run, means to avoid "wasting votes" or splitting the vote causing an election result not wanted.

These are third-party candidates who have been accused of denying victory to a major nominee in U.S. Presidential Elections; a notable case among these is the 1912 election, where Progressive Party candidate Theodore Roosevelt won almost 700,000 votes more than did the Republican incumbent, William Howard Taft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-1912 | title=United States presidential election of 1912 | work=Encyclopedia Britannica | accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus it could be said that Taft was the spoiler for Roosevelt in that election. This argument worried Republicans, who, after [[Woodrow Wilson]] won the 1912 election, became concerned that Roosevelt might return to split the Republican vote again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2016/05/05/history/post-perspective/100-years-ago-fear-republican-spoiler.html | title=100 Years Ago: Fear of a Republican Spoiler | work=Saturday Evening Post | date=5 May 2016 | accessdate=10 May 2017 | author=Nilsson, Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]], [[George Wallace]] ran for president as the [[American Independent Party]]'s nominee. He received numerous votes from Southern demographics that typically voted for Democratic candidates, thereby undercutting the candidacy of that election's Democratic nominee, [[Hubert Humphrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://faculty.bus.lsu.edu/sarangi/paper%20files/Ghostsofelectionspast.pdf |title=Ghosts of Elections Past: Third-Party Shepherds and Stray Voters |last=Belsome |first=Ross |last2=Newman |first2=Robert J. |date=April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bush, Gore, and Nader (2000 U.S. presidential election)====
The [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. Presidential election]] is often cited as an example of the spoiler effect. In that election, [[Al Gore]], the Democratic candidate, received more popular votes than [[George W. Bush]], the Republican candidate, but lost in the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]]. In the state of [[Florida]], the final certified vote count showed Bush with just 537 more votes than Gore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/2000presgeresults.htm|title=2000 Official Presidential General Election Results|date=December 2001|publisher=Federal Election Commission|author=Public Disclosure Division|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Bush defeated Gore in Florida, he won the state, received more votes in the electoral college, and became president of the United States.

Gore supporters argued that had candidate [[Ralph Nader]], a liberal, not run in the election, the majority of the 97,421 votes he received in Florida would have been cast for Gore.  Thus, they contend that Nader's candidacy spoiled the election for Gore by taking away enough votes from Gore in Florida to swing the election to Bush. Their argument is bolstered by a poll of Nader voters, asking them for whom they would have voted had Nader not run, which said 45 percent of Nader voters would have voted for Gore, 27 percent would have voted for Bush, and the rest would not have voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E4D6173CF937A15751C0A9629C8B63|title=Relax, Nader Advises Alarmed Democrats, but the 2000 Math Counsels Otherwise|last=Rosenbaum|first=David E.|date=February 24, 2004|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=August 30, 2010|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nader himself and many of his supporters argued that most Nader voters would either have chosen another minor party candidate or [[abstain]]ed from voting, had Nader not been on the ballot. It should also be noted that all other third party candidates on the ballot in Florida received more than the 537 vote difference between Bush and Gore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=State Elections Offices|title=2000 OFFICIAL PRESIDENTIAL GENERAL ELECTION RESULTS|url=http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/2000presgeresults.htm|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Still, some observers began to refer to the spoiler effect as the "Nader effect" after the 2000 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,994287,00.html|journal=Time|last=Bacon Jr.|first=Perry|last2=Tumulty|first2=Karen|title=The Nader Effect|date=May 31, 2004|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/02/23/politics/main601802.shtml|last=Kuhn|first=David Paul|title=The Nader Effect|date=February 23, 2004|work=CBSNews.com|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/09/opinion/the-next-nader-effect.html|title=The Next Nader Effect|newspaper=The New York Times| date=March 9, 2004| last=Cook| first=Charlie|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 study found that at least 40% of Nader voters in Florida would have voted for Bush if Nader had not run, while the other 60% would have voted for Gore. The study concluded that this 60% "did indeed spoil the 2000 presidential election for Gore but only because of highly idiosyncratic circumstances, namely, Florida’s extreme closeness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Herron |first=Michael |last2=Lewis |first2=Jeffrey |year=2006 |title=Did Ralph Nader Spoil a Gore Presidency?

===Other US elections===
* In the [[Oregon gubernatorial election, 1934]], Republican Peter Zimmerman ran as an independent, receiving 31.7% of the vote compared to Democratic victor [[Charles Martin (Oregon politician)|Charles Martin]]'s 38.6% and Republican nominee Joe Dunne's 28.7%. Altogether, the Republicans received 60.3% of the vote.
* A similar trend was seen in the [[Oregon gubernatorial election, 1990]], when conservative activist Al Mobley ran as an independent, receiving 13% of the vote. Democrat [[Barbara Roberts]] defeated Republican [[David B. Frohnmayer]] 45.7% to 40%.
* In 1994, moderate Republican [[Marshall Coleman]] ran for the U.S. Senate as an independent, receiving over 11 percent of the vote in an election where Democrat [[Chuck Robb]] defeated Republican nominee [[Oliver North]] by only three percent of the vote.
* In [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2008|2008]], Democrat [[Al Franken]] was elected the junior senator from [[Minnesota]], defeating [[Norm Coleman]] by only 0.1%. Independent candidate [[Dean Barkley]] received over 15% of the vote, and a 2014 analysis by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' found that without Barkley in the race, Franken would have lost the election to Coleman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://time.com/libertarian-spoiler-candidates/ |title=The Surprisingly Low Impact of Libertarian Candidates |last=Wilson |first=Chris |last2=Ho |first2=Alexander |website=Time |publication-date=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois, 2010#District 8*|2010]], [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] candidate Bill Scheurer ran for Illinois 8th Congressional District against Democratic incumbent [[Melissa Bean]]. Republican [[Joe Walsh (Illinois politician)|Joe Walsh]] won the election in a surprising upset with only a 291-vote (0.1%) difference with Bean, while Scheurer received 6,494 votes (3.2%).
* As a result of the [[2011 Wisconsin protests]] and subsequent [[recall election]]s, the [[Wisconsin Republican Party]] has encouraged spoiler candidates to run in the recall elections on the Democrat ticket in order to force the Democrats into a [[Primary election]].  Republicans argued that this will even the playing field in the recalls, as incumbents facing recall did not have the time to campaign due to their work load in the [[Wisconsin State Senate|state senate]].&lt;ref name=WGBSC&gt;{{cite news|title=Wisconsin GOP backs spoiler candidates in recall elections|url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/article_df8f9e60-9056-11e0-8101-001cc4c03286.html|newspaper=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maine politician [[Eliot Cutler]], an [[Independent (politics)|independent]], has been accused of siphoning enough votes from Democratic candidates to allow Republican [[Paul LePage]] to win the [[Maine gubernatorial election, 2010|2010]] and [[Maine gubernatorial election, 2014|2014]] gubernatorial elections with [[Plurality (voting)|pluralities]] of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cutler|first1=Eliot|title=Who Stole Election Day?|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703326204575616890895700112|website=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Ben|title=Could Maine Re-Elect Its Wingnut Governor Paul LePage?|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/21/maine-governor-paul-lepage-to-be-rescued-by-third-party-rival.html|website=The Daily Beast|publisher=The Daily Beast Company|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fallows|first1=James|title=Third-Party Watch in Maine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/third-party-watch-in-maine/378893/|website=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nemitz|first1=Bill|title=Eliot Cutler facing up to 'spoiler' label|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2014/05/09/bill_nemitz__eliot_cutler_facing_up_to__spoiler__label_/|website=Portland Press Herald|publisher=MaineToday Media, Inc.|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Halkias|first1=Telly|title=Eliot Cutler and the Myth of Election Spoilers|url=http://www.portlanddailysun.me/index.php/opinion/columns/13249-eliot-cutler-and-the-myth-of-election-spoilers|website=Portland Daily Sun|publisher=Portland Daily Sun|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Several races in the 2014 election cycle were allegedly influenced by spoiler candidates, most notably [[Hawaii gubernatorial election, 2014|Hawaii's gubenatorial elections]] and the [[United States Senate election in Kansas, 2014|Kansas senatorial]] race. In the [[United States Senate election in Mississippi, 2014|Mississippi senatorial]] Republican primary, a [[paper candidate]], Thomas Carey, who received less than two percent of the vote prevented both top contenders, incumbent [[Thad Cochran]] and challenger [[Chris McDaniel]], from avoiding a runoff. Had the spoiler (Carey) not run, the race between McDaniel and Cochran would have avoided a runoff.
* In both the [[virginia gubernatorial election, 2013|2013 Virginia Gubernatorial Election]] and the [[United States Senate election in Virginia, 2014|2014 Virginia US Senate Election]], Libertarian [[Robert Sarvis]] received a number of votes greater than the difference between the Republican and Democratic candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2013 Elections: Virginia Governor And More (LIVE RESULTS)|url = http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2013/results|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-06-07|first = Aaron|last = Bycoffe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Virginia Election Results 2014: Senate Map by County, Live Midterm Voting Updates|url = http://www.politico.com/2014-election/results/map/senate/virginia/#.VXOi4bxVK1E|website = POLITICO|accessdate = 2015-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the similarity in Republican and Libertarian views, it is likely that the Republican would have won each election if not for the inclusion of Sarvis on the ballot.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
* In the [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 2016|2016 New Hampshire Senate election]], conservative independent candidate Aaron Day won about 18,000 votes. Given his political leanings, it is likely that the vast majority of his voters otherwise would have voted for incumbent Senator [[Kelly Ayotte]], who lost to Governor [[Maggie Hassan]] by about 1,000 votes, thus costing Ayotte reelection.

==Other countries==

In the [[German presidential election, 1925|German presidential election of 1925]], [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist]] [[Ernst Thälmann]] refused to withdraw his candidacy though it was extremely unlikely he would win the election and the leadership of the [[Communist International]] urged him not to run. In the second (and final) round of balloting, Thälmann won 1,931,151 votes or 6.4 percent. [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centrist]] candidate [[Wilhelm Marx]] won 13,751,605 or 45.3 percent.  And independent candidate Paul von Hindenburg, endorsed by the [[German National People's Party|German nationalists]], [[German People's Party|nationalist liberals]], and [[Nazi Party|Nazis]], won 14,655,641 votes or 48.3 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gonschior.de/weimar/Deutschland/Praesidenten.html| title=Die Präsidenten des Deutschen Reiches 1919 – 1934 | accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If most of Thälmann's supporters had voted for Marx instead of the right-wing nationalist Hindenburg, Marx would have won the election. The election of 1925 had great significance because in 1933 Hindenburg appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] as [[Chancellor of Germany|chancellor]] and then died the following year, giving Hitler unchecked control of the German government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carlson|first1=Cody K.|title=This week in history: Hindenburg elected German president|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865627566/This-week-in-history-Hindenburg-elected-German-president.html|website=Deseret News|accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, Marx, who was dedicated to republican democracy, lived until 1946.

In New Zealand, there have been two notable cases of the spoiler effect. In the [[New Zealand general election, 1984|1984 general election]], the free-market [[New Zealand Party]] deliberately ran for office in order to weaken support for the incumbent Prime Minister [[Robert Muldoon]]. Later on, the [[New Zealand general election, 1993|1993 general election]] saw the [[New Zealand Labour Party]]'s vote split by [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|The Alliance]], which has been attributed to the vagaries of the [[first past the post]] electoral system. In response to these problems, New Zealand has since adopted the [[Mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional]] voting system.

Likewise, in France, the [[2002 French presidential election|2002 presidential elections]] have been cited as a case of the spoiler effect: the numerous left-wing candidates, such as [[Christiane Taubira]] and [[Jean-Pierre Chevènement]], both from political parties allied to the [[French Socialist Party (1902)|French Socialist Party]], or the three candidates from [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] parties, which altogether totalled around 20%, have been charged with making [[Lionel Jospin]], the P.S. candidate, lose the two-round election in the first round to the benefit of [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], who was separated from Jospin by only 0.68%. Some also cite the case of some districts in which although the right and the far right had more than half of the votes, the left still won the election; they accuse the left of profiting from their split.

In [[Hong Kong]] it is a very common for the [[Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|Pro-democracy camp]], and it suffered greatly in many election including the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2016]] and [[Hong Kong local elections, 2015]]. Usually for [[Liberalism in Hong Kong|Pro-Democracy]] supporters, they have way different ideologies and suffer from factional disputes, which exacerbates after the advent of [[Localist groups (Hong Kong)|localist groups]]. Though have wider aggregate support, the seats earned is even less than the [[Pro-Beijing camp (Hong Kong)|Pro-Beijing camp]], like in Kowloon East, Pro-Democracy got over 55% ballots but eventually earn only 2 seats out of 5.

==Sports==
In sports, the "spoiler effect" refers to a similar phenomenon, in which a team or individual has been [[Elimination from possibility of reaching postseason|eliminated from the possibility of reaching the postseason]], but affects the playoffs or finals anyway by beating a more successful team or individual before the end of the season. For example, a baseball team that is ten games out of contention for a playoff berth could defeat a team that has a playoff berth several times. This could cause the would-be playoff team to be passed by in the rankings by the team directly behind it before the final positions at the end of the season are determined.

In individual participant sports, such as automobile racing, a racer with no hope of obtaining a championship title could prevent a racer with a chance at the title by defeating them, preventing the contending racer from earning critical points toward winning the title. Instead, the title would go to the contender directly behind him in the rankings, provided that second-tier racer is close enough to surpass and they win their own competition.

'''''Strekoza''''' ({{lang-ru|Стрекоза|lit='Dragonfly'}}) was a [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] [[weekly]] magazine of humour and satire established in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1875 by the publisher German Kornfeld. Its original editor-in-chief was Nikolai Bogdanov who left in 1879 to be succeeded by Ippolit Vasilevsky (1879-1905). In its heyday its circulation peaked at 9 thousand.&lt;ref name="lit_enc"&gt;[http://feb-web.ru/feb/kle/KLE-abc/ke7/ke7-2161.htm Стрекоза] at the Brief Russian Encyclopedia // Фундаментальная электронная энциклопедия. Краткая литературная энциклопедия&lt;/ref&gt; 

Initially seen by many as a successor to the leading Russian satirical magazine ''[[Iskra (magazine)|Iskra]]'' which had been closed in 1873, ''Strekoza'' attracted many authors, associated with its radical predecessor, including [[Pyotr Bykov]], [[Gavriil Zhulev]], [[Nikolai Leykin]], [[Aleksey Pleshcheyev]], [[Pyotr Sergeyenko]] and [[Liodor Palmin]]. Still, the political climate in Russia by this time had changed, and the magazine adopted a centrist, liberal stance, choosing not to conflict with authorities, even if Vasilevsky, its most active contributor, rarely missed an opportunity to fence with his conservative opponents, notably [[Mikhail Katkov]] and [[Vladimir Meshchersky|Prince Meshchersky]].&lt;ref name="lit_enc"/&gt;

Among the authors whose work occasionally appeared in ''Strekoza'', were [[Nikolai Leskov]], [[Yakov Polonsky]], [[Dmitry Grigorovich]] and [[Viktor Bilibin]]. It was in ''Strekoza'' that in 1879 (No. 51 issue) [[Anton Chekhov]] debuted with a piece called "The Mayor's Archeological Report" (Археологический рапорт городничего), followed in March 1880 (No.10 issue) by "The Don Landowner's Stepan Vladimirovich's Letter to His Learned Neighbor Dr. Friedrich" (better known under its shortened title "A Letter to a Learned Neighbor"). In all, ten Chekhov's stories appeared here in 1880, then two more in 1883-1884.&lt;ref name="lit_enc"/&gt;  

In 1908 ''Strekoza'' folded. It was re-launched in 1915 by the publisher Isaak Bogelman, and lasted until 1918.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36711">'''Superior orders''', often known as the '''Nuremberg defense''', '''lawful orders''' or by the [[German language|German]] phrase '''Befehl ist Befehl''' ("an order is an order"), is a [[plea]] in a court of law that a person—whether a member of the [[military]], [[law enforcement]], a [[firefighting]] force, or the [[civilian]] population—not be held guilty for actions ordered by a [[Officer (armed forces)|superior officer]] or an [[official]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' L.C. Green, ''Superior Orders in National and International Law'', (A. W. Sijthoff International Publishing Co., Netherlands, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark J. Osiel, ''Obeying Orders: Atrocity, Military Discipline, and the Law of War'', (Transactions Publishers, New Brunswick, N.J., 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The superior orders plea is often regarded as the complement to [[command responsibility]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' James B. Insco, ''Defense of Superior Orders Before Military Commissions'', Duke Journal of Comparative and International Law, 13 DUKEJCIL 389 (Spring, 2003). Asserting in the author's view that a ''respondeat superior'' approach to superior orders is an "underinclusive extreme".&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most noted uses of this plea, or [[defense (legal)|defense]], was by the accused in the 1945–1946 [[Nuremberg trials]], such that it is also called the "Nuremberg defense". The Nuremberg Trials were a series of [[Military justice|military tribunals]], held by the main victorious [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] after [[World War II]], most notable for the prosecution of prominent members of the political, military, and economic leadership of the defeated [[Nazi Germany]]. These trials, under the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] that set them up, established that the defense of superior orders was no longer enough to escape punishment, but merely enough to lessen punishment.&lt;ref&gt;H.T. King, Jr., ''The Legacy of Nuremberg'', Case Western Journal of International Law, Vol. 34. (Fall 2002) at pg. 335.e&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the plea of superior orders has been used both before and after the Nuremberg Trials, with a [[#Historical overview summary table|notable lack of consistency in various rulings]].

Apart from the specific plea of superior orders, discussions about how the general concept of superior orders ought to be used, or ought not to be used, have taken place in various arguments, rulings and statutes that have not necessarily been part of "after the fact" [[war crimes trials]], strictly speaking. Nevertheless, these discussions and related events help to explain the evolution of the specific plea of superior orders and the history of its usage.

===The trial of Peter von Hagenbach===

{{See also|Command responsibility}}
[[Image:Deutsche Geschichte5-310.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hagenbach on trial, from [[Bern]]er Chronik des Diebold Schilling dem Älteren]]

In 1474, in the trial of [[Peter von Hagenbach]] by an ad hoc tribunal of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the first known "international" recognition of commanders' obligations to act lawfully occurred.&lt;ref name="Greppi"&gt;[http://www.icrc.ch/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JQ2X The evolution of individual criminal responsibility under international law] By Edoardo Greppi, Associate Professor of International Law at the [[University of Turin]], [[Italy]], [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] No. 835, p. 531–553, October 30, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/alumni/bulletin/2006/spring/gallery.php Exhibit highlights the first international war crimes tribunal] by Linda Grant, Harvard Law Bulletin.&lt;/ref&gt; Hagenbach offered the defense that he was just following orders, but this defense was rejected and he was convicted of [[war crimes]] and beheaded.&lt;ref name="Schabas"&gt;[http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/81258/excerpt/9780521881258_excerpt.pdf An Introduction to the International Criminal Court] William A. Schabas, [[Cambridge University Press]], Third Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, Hagenbach was put on trial for atrocities committed under his command but not by him directly, during the occupation of [[Breisach]]. This was the earliest modern European example of the doctrine of [[command responsibility]].&lt;ref name="Schabas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mens_Rea"&gt;[http://www.globalpolicy.org/intljustice/general/2005/command.htm Command Responsibility] The Mens Rea Requirement, By Eugenia Levine, [[Global Policy Forum]], February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Since he was convicted for crimes "he as a knight was deemed to have a duty to prevent", Hagenbach defended himself by arguing that he was only following orders&lt;ref name="Greppi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/reportsfromabroad/murray/20020718.html Judge and master] By Don Murray, [[CBC News]], July 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Duke of Burgundy]], [[Charles the Bold]], to whom the Holy Roman Empire had given Breisach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.gsu.edu/Miller_Lecture/2006/MillerLecture-S06-BassiouniDraft.pdf The Perennial Conflict Between International Criminal Justice and Realpolitik] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910183610/http://law.gsu.edu/Miller_Lecture/2006/MillerLecture-S06-BassiouniDraft.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }} February 10, 2006 Draft by M.

==History from 1900 to 1947==

===Court-martial of Breaker Morant===

{{see also|Court-martial of Breaker Morant}}

During the [[Second Boer War]], three Australian officers ([[Breaker Morant|Morant]], [[Peter Handcock|Handcock]] and [[George Witton|Witton]]) were charged and tried for a number of murders, including those of prisoners who had surrendered. A significant part of the defense was that they were acting under orders issued by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] to "take no prisoners". However, these orders were verbal, were denied by Kitchener and his staff, and could not be validated in court, resulting in a guilty verdict against all three men.

===German military trials after World War I===

On June 4, 1921, the legal doctrine of superior orders was used during the [[Leipzig War Crimes Trials|German Military Trials]] that took place after [[World War I]]: One of the most famous of these trials was the matter of Lieutenant Karl Neumann, who was a [[U-boat]] captain responsible for the sinking of the hospital ship the ''[[HMHS Dover Castle|Dover Castle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C04EEDA1739E133A25756C0A9609C946095D6CF |title=Free Man Who Sank a Hospital Ship; Leipsic Judges Acquit Neumann on the Ground That He Acted Under Orders. He Admitted Torpedoing. Prosecutor Demanded Acquittal, Calling Dover Castle Culpable in Carrying Wounded Soldiers. |author=[[New York Times]] |date=June 5, 1921 |work= |publisher=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though he frankly admitted to having sunk the ship, he stated that he had done so on the basis of orders supplied to him by the [[German Imperial Admiralty Staff|German Admiralty]] and so he could not be held liable for his actions. The [[Reichsgericht]], then Germany's supreme court, acquitted him, accepting the defense of superior orders as a grounds to escape criminal liability.&lt;ref&gt;Anon., "German War Trials: Judgement in Case of Commander Karl Neumann", ''The American Journal of International Law'', Vol. 16, No. 4. (Oct., 1922) at pp. 704–708.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, that very court had this to say in the matter of superior orders:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... that all civilized nations recognize the principle that a subordinate is covered by the orders of his superiors.&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Finch, "Superior Orders and War Crimes", ''The American Journal of International Law'', Vol. 15, No. 3. (Jul., 1921) at pp. 440–445.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many accused of war crimes were acquitted on a similar defense, creating immense dissatisfaction among the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. That has been thought to be one of the main causes for the specific removal of this defense in the August 8, 1945 [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]]. The removal has been attributed to the actions of [[Robert H. Jackson]], a Justice of the [[United States Supreme Court]], who was appointed Chief Prosecutor at the [[Nuremberg trials]].

===Dostler case===
[[File:Anton Dostler 1945 Colourized.jpg|thumb|right|Dostler tied to a stake before the execution]]
On October 8, 1945, [[Anton Dostler]] was the first [[General (Germany)|German general]] to be tried for war crimes by a US [[military tribunal]] at the [[Royal Palace of Caserta|Royal Palace]] in [[Caserta]]. He was accused of ordering the execution of 15 captured US soldiers of [[Operations Ginny I and II|Operation Ginny II]] in Italy in March 1944. He admitted to ordering the execution but said that he could not be held responsible because he was following orders from his superiors. The execution of the [[prisoners of war]] in Italy, ordered by Dostler, was an implementation of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Commando Order]] of 1942, which required the immediate execution of all [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[commandos]], whether they were in proper uniforms or not, without trial if they were apprehended by German forces. The tribunal rejected the defense of Superior Orders and found Dostler guilty of war crimes. He was sentenced to death and [[execution by firing squad|executed by a firing squad]] on December 1, 1945, in [[Aversa]].

The Dostler case became a precedent for the principle that was used in the Nuremberg Trials of German generals, officials, and Nazi leaders beginning in November 1945: using superior orders as a defense does not relieve officers from responsibility of carrying out illegal orders and their liability to be punished in court. The principle was codified in [[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Principle IV]] of the [[Nuremberg Principles]], and similar principles were found in sections of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

===Nuremberg Trials after World War II===

{{See also|Nuremberg trials}}

In 1945 and 1946, during the [[Nuremberg trials]] the issue of superior orders again arose. Before the end of [[World War II]], the Allies suspected such a defense might be employed and issued the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] (IMT), which explicitly stated that following an unlawful order is not a valid defense against charges of [[war crime]]s.

Thus, under [[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Nuremberg Principle IV]], "defense of superior orders" is not a defense for war crimes, although it might be a mitigating factor that could influence a sentencing authority to lessen the penalty. Nuremberg Principle IV states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the Nuremberg Trials, [[Wilhelm Keitel]], [[Alfred Jodl]] and other defendants unsuccessfully used the defense. They contended that while they knew [[Adolf Hitler]]'s orders were unlawful, or at least had reason to believe they were unlawful, their place was not to question, but to obey. They claimed they were compelled to do so by the ''[[Führerprinzip]]'' (leader principle) that governed the Nazi regime, as well as their own [[Hitler oath|oath of allegiance to Hitler]]. In most cases, the tribunal found that the defendants' offenses were so egregious that obedience to superior orders could not be considered a mitigating factor.

(Before the trials, there was little consensus among the Allies as to what was to be done with the [[Nazi]] war prisoners. [[Winston Churchill]] was inclined to have the leaders 'executed as outlaws'.&lt;ref name="Timesarticle784041"&gt;{{cite news|title=Churchill: execute Hitler without trial|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=[[Times Newspapers Limited]]|date=2006-01-01|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article784041.ece|accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets desired trials but wished there to be a presumption of guilt, as opposed to the procedural presumption of innocence that accompanies most [[Western civilization|Western]] criminal trials.&lt;ref&gt;K.C. Moghalu, Global Justice: The Politics of War Crime Trials, (Greenwood Publishers, 2006), sourced from Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;)

The German military law since 1872 said &lt;ref&gt;''Militär-Strafgesetzbuch für das Deutsche Reich, § 47''. The difference to the present regulation, as found in the ''Wehrstrafgesetz'' § 5, is only marginal, at least as far as the letter of the law is concerned.&lt;/ref&gt; that while the superior is ("solely") responsible for his order, the subordinate ''is'' to be punished for his participation in it if he either transgressed the order on his own account, or if he knew the order to be criminal.&lt;ref&gt;''wenn ihm bekannt gewesen, daß der Befehl des Vorgesetzten eine Handlung betraf, welche ein bürgerliches oder militärisches Verbrechen oder Vergehen bezweckte'', i.e., "... if it was known to him that the superior's order concerned an action that aimed at a civil or military felony or misdemeanor". According to general legal interpretation, "if he knew" means "unless he didn't know ''and'' had a valid excuse for not knowing".&lt;/ref&gt; For many of their offenses (e.g., killing a non-combatant without trial) the Nazis did not bother to (or were too reluctant to) legalize them by a formal law, so, the judges at Nuremberg could have argued that the defendants heavily broke German law to begin with. However, this line of argumentation was only in very limited amounts argued on in the trials.

==="Nuremberg defense"===

The trials gained so much attention that the "superior orders defense" has subsequently become interchangeable with the label "Nuremberg defense", a [[legal defense]] that essentially states that defendants were "only following orders" ("Befehl ist Befehl", literally "an order is an order") and so are not responsible for their crimes.

However, US General [[Telford Taylor]], who had served as Chief Counsel for the United States during the Nuremberg trials, employed the term "Nuremberg defense" in a different sense. He applied it not to the defense offered by the Nuremberg defendants but to a justification put forward by those who refused to take part in military action (specifically America's involvement in the Vietnam War) that they believed to be criminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Telford|title=Nuremberg and Vietnam: An American Tragedy|year=1970|publisher=The New York Times Group|location=New York|pages=15|quote=The claim that American intervention in Vietnam is itself an aggressive war and therefore criminal - the so-called 'Nuremberg defense' - has been put forward by draft card burners, draftees facing induction and soldiers about to be shipped to Vietnam.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History from 1947 to 2000==
[[File:Adolf Eichmann at Trial1961.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Eichmann on trial in 1961]]
The defense of superior orders again arose in the 1961 trial of Nazi war criminal [[Adolf Eichmann]] in [[Israel]], as well as the trial of [[Alfredo Astiz]] of [[Argentina]], the latter responsible for a large number of disappearances and kidnappings that took place during that country's [[National Reorganization Process|last civil-military dictatorship]] (1976-1983), which forced a [[State-sponsored terrorism]] upon the population,&lt;ref name="cineaste.com"&gt;[http://www.cineaste.com/articles/emthe-secret-in-their-eyesem-historical-memory-production-models-and-the-foreign-film-oscar The Secret in Their Eyes: Historical Memory, Production Models, and the Foreign Film Oscar (WEB EXCLUSIVE)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127110647/http://www.cineaste.com/articles/emthe-secret-in-their-eyesem-historical-memory-production-models-and-the-foreign-film-oscar |date=2012-01-27 }} Matt Losada, ''[[Cineaste Magazine]]'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in what (to several sources) amounted to a [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;CONADEP, Nunca Más Report, Chapter II, Section One:''Advertencia'', [http://www.desaparecidos.org/arg/conadep/nuncamas/] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hmh.org/la_Genocide_Argentina.shtml Atrocities in Argentina (1976–1983)] [[Holocaust Museum Houston]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s the use of ''[[Befehlsnotstand]]'' ({{lang-en|Compulsion to obey orders}}), a concept in which a certain action is ordered which violates law but where the refusal to carry out such an order would lead to drastic consequences for the person refusing to carry out the order, as a defence in war crimes trials in Germany was quite successful as it protected the accused from punishment. With the formation of the [[Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes]] this changed as a historical research by the organisation revealed that refusing an unlawful order did not result in punishment.&lt;ref name="Welt 2015" &gt;{{cite news |last=Kellerhoff |first=Sven Felix |author-link=Sven Felix Kellerhoff |date=15 July 2015|title=Hatten SS-Mitglieder damals wirklich „keine Wahl“?|trans-title=Did SS members really have no choice?|url=https://www.welt.de/geschichte/zweiter-weltkrieg/article144067359/Hatten-SS-Mitglieder-damals-wirklich-keine-Wahl.html|language=German |work=[[Die Welt]] |location= |access-date=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli law since 1956===
In 1957, the Israeli legal system established the concept of a 'blatantly illegal order' to explain when a military order (or in general, a security-related order) should be followed, and when an order ''must not'' be followed. The concept is explained in 1957 by the infamous [[Kafr Qasim massacre]] ruling.

The Kafr Qasim trial considered for the first time the issue of when Israeli security personnel are required to disobey illegal orders. The judges decided that soldiers do not have the obligation to examine each and every order in detail as to its legality, nor were they entitled to disobey orders merely on a subjective feeling that they might be illegal. On the other hand, some orders were manifestly illegal, and these must be disobeyed. Judge [[Benjamin Halevy]]'s words, still much-quoted today, were that "The distinguishing mark of a manifestly illegal order is that above such an order should fly, like a black flag, a warning saying: 'Prohibited!'"&lt;ref&gt;M. R. Lippman, Humanitarian Law: The Development and Scope of the Superior Orders Defense, Penn State International Law Review, Fall 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leora Y. Bilsky, Transformative Justice : Israeli Identity on Trial (Law, Meaning, and Violence), University of Michigan Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-472-03037-X}}, pp169–197, 310-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain (res.) Itai Haviv, a signatory of the 'courage to refuse' letter of 2002 tells of his unhappiness about his service for the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) and says "For 35 years a black flag was proudly hanging over our heads, but we have refused to see it". A translation note explains the "Black Flag" principle but adds "In the 45 years that passed since [the ruling], not even a single soldier was protected by a military court for refusing to obey a command because it was a 'black flag' command."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seruv.org.il/Signers/ItaiHavivEng.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1968 My Lai Massacre===
Following the [[My Lai Massacre]] in 1968, the defense was employed during the court martial of [[William Calley]]. Some have argued that the outcome of the My Lai Massacre courts martial was a reversal of the laws of war that were set forth in the [[Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal|Nuremberg]] and [[Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marshall|first=Burke|author2=Goldstein, Joseph |title=Learning From My Lai: A Proposal on War Crimes|publisher=The New York Times|date=2 April 1976|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Secretary of the Army]] [[Howard Callaway]] was quoted in the ''New York Times'' as stating that Calley's sentence was reduced because Calley believed that what he did was a part of his orders.

In ''[[United States v. Keenan]]'', the accused was found guilty of murder after he obeyed an order to shoot and kill an elderly [[Vietnam]]ese citizen. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces|Court of Military Appeals]] held that "the justification for acts done pursuant to orders does not exist if the order was of such a nature that a man of ordinary sense and understanding would know it to be illegal". The soldier who gave the order, Corporal Luczko, was acquitted by reason of insanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/militarylaw1/a/obeyingorders.htm |title= Military Orders To Obey or Not to Obey?|author=Rod Powers |work= About.com: US Military|publisher= |accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court===
{{See|States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court}}
The provision containing the superior orders defense can be found as a defense to international crimes in the [[Rome Statute]] of the [[International Criminal Court]]. (The Rome Statute was agreed upon in 1998 as the foundational document of the International Criminal Court, established to try those individuals accused of serious international crimes.) Article 33, titled "Superior orders and prescription of law",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/romefra.htm|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; Part 3: General Principles of Criminal Law; Article 33: Superior orders and prescription of law|author= Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|date=10 November 1998 and 12 July 1999 |work= |publisher=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
states:

{{quote|1.	The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal responsibility unless:

*(a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;
*(b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and
*(c) The order was not manifestly unlawful.

2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful.}}

There are two interpretations{{who|date=November 2010}} of this Article:

*This formulation, especially (1)(a), whilst effectively prohibiting the use of the Nuremberg defense in relation to charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, does however, appear to allow the Nuremberg defense to be used as a protection against charges of war crimes, provided the relevant criteria are met.
*Nevertheless, this interpretation of ICC Article 33 is open to debate: For example, Article 33 (1)(c) protects the defendant only if "the order was not manifestly unlawful". The "order" could be considered "unlawful" if we consider [[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Nuremberg Principle IV]] to be the applicable "law" in this case. If so, then the defendant is not protected. Discussion as to whether or not Nuremberg Principle IV is the applicable law in this case is found in [[Nuremberg Principles#The Principles.27 power or lack of power|a discussion of the Nuremberg Principles' power or lack of power]].

===Legal proceedings of Jeremy Hinzman in Canada===

{{See also|Jeremy Hinzman|Anne L. Mactavish|Canada and Iraq War resisters}}
[[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Nuremberg Principle IV]], and its reference to an individual's responsibility, was at issue in [[Canada]] in the case of ''Hinzman v. Canada.'' [[Jeremy Hinzman]] was a [[U.S. Army]] [[deserter]] who claimed [[refugee]] status in Canada as a [[conscientious objector]], one of [[List of Iraq War Resisters#Objectors who have fled to Canada|many Iraq War resisters]]. Hinzman's lawyer, (at that time [[Jeffry House]]), had previously raised the issue of the [[legality of the Iraq War]] as having a bearing on their case. The [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]] ruling was released on March 31, 2006, and denied the refugee status claim.&lt;ref name="Mernagh, M"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=153504&amp;archive=25,38,2006|title=AWOL GIs Dealt Legal Blow|date=2006-05-18|author=Mernagh, M.|publisher=Toronto's Now Magazine|accessdate=2008-06-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605061945/http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=153504&amp;archive=25%2C38%2C2006|archivedate=2011-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://reports.fja.gc.ca/eng/2006/2006fc420/2006fc420.html|title=Hinzman v.

===Legal proceedings of Ehren Watada in the United States===

In June 2006, during the [[Iraq War]], [[Ehren Watada]] refused to go to Iraq on account of his belief that the Iraq war was a [[crime against peace]] (waging a [[war of aggression]] for territorial aggrandizement), which he believed could make him liable for prosecution under the [[command responsibility doctrine]]. In this case, the judge ruled that soldiers, in general, are not responsible for determining whether the order to go to war itself is a lawful order – but are only responsible for those orders resulting in a specific application of military force, such as an order to shoot civilians, or to treat POWs inconsistently with the Geneva Conventions. This is consistent with the Nuremberg defense, as only the civilian and military principals of the Axis were charged with [[crimes against peace]], while subordinate military officials were not so charged.&lt;ref name=SeattlePI060620&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/274585_watada20.html Soldier's Iraq war stance backed: Watada has right to refuse to go, retired officer says], ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often the case in modern warfare that while subordinate military officials are not held liable for their actions, neither are their superiors, as was the case with Calley's immediate superior Captain Ernest Medina.

Based on this principle, [[international law]] developed the concept of individual criminal liability for war crimes, which resulted in the current doctrine of [[command responsibility]].&lt;ref name="Danner-Martinez"&gt;[http://www.law.berkeley.edu/students/curricularprograms/ils/workshop/fall04_Martinez.pdf Guilty Associations: Joint Criminal Enterprise, Command Responsibility, and the Development of International Criminal Law] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060910213027/http://www.law.berkeley.edu/students/curricularprograms/ils/workshop/fall04_Martinez.pdf HTML version] by Allison Marston Danner and Jenny S.

===Arguments===

{{See also|international legal theory|sources of international law|laws of war|Rule of Law in Armed Conflicts Project}}
The superior orders defense is still used with the following rationale in the following scenario: An "order" may come from one's superior at the level of ''national'' law. But according to [[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Nuremberg Principle IV]], such an order is sometimes "unlawful" according to ''international'' law. Such an "unlawful order" presents a legal dilemma from which there is no legal escape: On one hand, a person who ''refuses'' such an unlawful order faces the possibility of legal punishment ''at the national level'' for refusing orders. On the other hand, a person who ''accepts'' such an unlawful order faces the possibility of legal punishment ''at the international level'' (e.g. [[Nuremberg Trials]]) for committing unlawful acts.

[[Nuremberg Principles#Principle II|Nuremberg Principle II]] responds to that dilemma by stating: "The fact that internal law does not impose a penalty for an act which constitutes a crime under [[international law]] does not relieve the person who committed the act from responsibility under international law."&lt;ref&gt;[[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) [[#References|References]] [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/INTRO/390?OpenDocument Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the Nüremberg Tribunal and in the Judgment of the Tribunal, 1950: Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

The above scenario might present a ''[[law|legal]]'' dilemma, but [[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Nuremberg Principle IV]] speaks of "a ''[[morality|moral]]'' choice" as being just as important as "legal" decisions: It states: "The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a ''moral'' choice was in fact possible to him".

In "moral choices" or [[ethical dilemma]]s an [[ethical decision]] is often made by appealing to a "higher ethic" such as [[ethics in religion]] or secular [[ethics]]. One such "higher ethic" found in many religions and in secular ethics, is the ''[[ethic of reciprocity]]'', or ''[[Golden Rule]]''. It states that one has a right to just treatment, and therefore has a reciprocal responsibility to ensure justice for others. ''Higher ethics'', such as those, could be used by an individual to solve the ''legal'' dilemma presented by the superior orders defense.

Another argument against the use of the superior orders defense is that it does not follow the traditional legal definitions and categories established under [[criminal law]]. Under criminal law, a [[principal (criminal law)|principal]] is any actor who is primarily responsible for a criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Superior Growers, 982 F.2d at 177–78; United States v. Campa, 679 F.2d 1006, 1013 (lst Cir. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Such an actor is distinguished from others who may also be subject to criminal liability as [[accomplice]]s, [[accessory (legal term)|accessories]] or [[conspiracy (crime)|conspirator]]s. (See also the various degrees of liability: [[absolute liability]], [[strict liability]], and [[mens rea]].)

The common argument in this matter, is that every individual under orders should be bound by law to immediately relieve of command a superior officer who gives an obviously unlawful order to their troops. This represents a rational check to be put in place versus organizational command hierarchies.

[[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Nuremberg Principle IV]], the [[international law]] that counters the superior orders defense, is legally supported by the [[jurisprudence]] found in [[Conscientious objector#Universal Declaration of Human Rights|certain articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that deal indirectly with conscientious objection]]. It is also supported by [[Conscientious objector#Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status|the principles found in paragraph 171 of the Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status]], which was issued by the Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR). Those principles deal with the conditions under which [[conscientious objector]]s can apply for refugee status in another country if they face persecution in their own country for refusing to participate in an illegal war.

'''Sustainable Australia''' (originally the '''Sustainable Population Party''' and officially registered as '''#Sustainable Australia''') is an Australian political party formed in 2010,&lt;ref name="AEC register extract" /&gt; that describes itself as being "from the political centre" and aiming "to secure an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable Australia". It has prioritised four issues: "secure jobs via a more diverse economy, "affordable housing for first home buyers and renters", "better planning to stop over-development" and  "a sustainable environment and population".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainableaustralia.org.au Party Website, Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal and state registration==

The party has been registered federally since 2010. In 2016 it also registered in the [[Australian Capital Territory]], and contested the [[Australian Capital Territory general election, 2016|2016 Australian Capital Election]]. In 2018 it also registered in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] for the 2018 state election and NSW for the 2019 state election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/votesustainable See the Party’s Facebook page, October 2016 posts]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=August 2018}}

==Left-right spectrum==
Sustainable Australia describes itself as a centrist party with strong focus on environment, resource levels, infrastructure, and population. It criticises excessive urban densification and sprawl. It strongly supports public transport; but in the 2016 Australian Capital Territory election it opposed the proposed [[Light rail in Canberra|light rail]], calling it “a Trojan horse for over-development”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.votesustainable.org.au/act See the policies on A.C.T.Transport on the Party’s website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies==

The Party’s website lists over 20 [https://www.sustainableaustralia.org.au/policies policies], addressing a variety of topics like Animals and Biodiversity, Economy and Jobs, Education, Environment, Foreign Investment, Housing Affordability, Sustainable Population and Immigration, and Transport.

==Attitudes to population growth and opposition to a "big Australia"==

Sustainable Australia is not a one-issue party, but its policies clearly call for a significant slowing of Australia’s rapid [[population growth]], which is a point of distinction from the current policies of the [[Australian Greens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greens.org.au/policies/population Greens Population Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this it more closely resembles the [[Australian Democrats]], among centrist Australian political parties, which traditionally sought to keep immigration numbers per year close to emigration per year.&lt;ref&gt;See the Australian Democrats' most recent [http://australian-democrats.org.au/policies/balloted-policies/Population.pdf member-balloted population policy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable Australia supports a non-discriminatory permanent immigration intake of around 70,000 persons per year, down from the 2015 level of over 200,000 per year. Its website [http://www.votesustainable.org.au/sustainable_population_immigration_Australia states] that 70,000 is closer to Australia’s long-term traditional average intake.

In 2010 the party opposed [[Kevin Rudd]]'s belief in a [[big Australia]], saying that a "big Australia" population would be "disastrous",&lt;ref name="Issue Background"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populationparty.org.au/Issue-Background|title=Issue Background|publisher=Australian Stable Population Party|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is "way beyond [Australia's] long-term carrying capacity"&lt;ref name="Issue Background" /&gt; and that "population growth is not inevitable".&lt;ref name="Issue Background" /&gt; Queensland coordinator Aaron Webber "became alarmed when hearing of Kevin Rudd's push for a 'Big Australia'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populationparty.org.au/Officials|title=Officials|publisher=Australian Stable Population Party|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party claims that "'stable population' policies would mean a more sustainable 26 million at 2050, not the Labor/Liberal 'big Australia' plan for 36 million and rising."&lt;ref name="Early Flyer"&gt;{{cite news|title=POPULATION - THE EVERYTHING ISSUE|newspaper=Flyer Distribution|date=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party ran a candidate in the [[Griffith by-election, 2014|Griffith by-election]], for Kevin Rudd's old seat.&lt;ref name="name=Griffith ABC"&gt;name="Griffith ABC"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Sustainable Australia used to be called the '''Sustainable Population Party'''. Its current name was registered with the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] on 18 January 2016. 
The party missed out on registration for the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]] by several days, but leader William Bourke ran unsuccessfully for the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] in [[New South Wales]] on an independent ticket with poet [[Mark O'Connor (poet)|Mark O'Connor]]. The party was registered shortly after the election on 23 September 2010.&lt;ref name="AEC register extract" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registered_parties/stable-population.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
The party was registered as "Stable Population Party of Australia", but on 28 February 2014 the Australian Electoral Commission approved a name-change to the "Sustainable Population Party".&lt;ref name="AEC register extract" /&gt; On 19 January 2016, the AEC approved a further name change to "#Sustainable Australia" (including a [[hashtag|hash]] symbol).&lt;ref name=aecreg&gt;{{cite web|title=#Sustainable Australia|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/party_registration/Registered_parties/sustainable.htm|website=Current Register of Political Parties|publisher=AEC|accessdate=19 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127114321/http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/party_registration/Registered_parties/sustainable.htm#|archive-date=27 January 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party ran at least two Senate candidates in every state and territory in the [[2013 Australian federal election]] and many local candidates also.&lt;ref name="Candidates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populationparty.org.au/Population-Party-Election-Candidates|title=Population Party - Candidates|publisher=Australian Stable Population Party|accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Party ran a candidate in the [[Griffith by-election, 2014|Griffith by-election]]&lt;ref name="name=Griffith ABC"/&gt; and also contested the [[Australian Senate special election in Western Australia, 2014|April 2014 re-run in Western Australia]] of the 2013 federal Senate elections.&lt;ref name="Candidates" /&gt; The party endorsed a local candidate for the 2015 Canning by-election—Angela Smith—an environmental scientist and resident of Canning. In September 2015 the party campaigned on a number of key issues including education, paid jobs, infrastructure, health care, renewable energy and housing affordability.

In the [[North Sydney by-election, 2015]] its candidate and founder William Bourke got one of the party's best results with over 2,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vtr.aec.gov.au/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-19402-137.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151207231925/http://vtr.aec.gov.au/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-19402-137.htm |archivedate=7 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/north-sydney-by-election-2015/results/&lt;/ref&gt;

The party has been involved in [[Glenn Druery]]'s [[Minor Party Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-05/bitter-dispute-erupts-over-senate-preferences-in-queensland/4939300 Bitter dispute erupts over Senate preferences in Queensland: ABC 5 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/special-features/alliance-of-micro-parties-boosts-odds-for-likes-of-one-nation-or-shooters-and-fishers-gaining-senate-spot-through-preferences/story-fnho52jp-1226713114765 Alliance of micro parties boosts odds for likes of One Nation or Shooters and Fishers gaining Senate spot through preferences: Daily Telegraph 5 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]], Sustainable Australia was led temporarily by ex-Labor Minister for Sustainability, [[Andrew McNamara]].&lt;ref&gt;https://mysunshinecoast.com.au/news/news-display/what-went-wrong,44610&lt;/ref&gt; The party fielded two [[Australian Senate|senate]] candidates in each of the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, as well as a candidate in the [[Division of Sydney]] for the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="2016candidates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/election/candidates.htm |title=Candidates for the 2016 federal election |date=12 June 2016 |access-date=12 June 2016 |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party received media attention in 2017 when Australian entrepreneur [[Dick Smith (entrepreneur)|Dick Smith]] joined the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dick Smith joins lower immigration party|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2017/09/07/dick-smith-joins-lower-immigration-party|website=News|accessdate=24 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Masanauskas|first1=John|title=Businessman Dick Smith joins political party Sustainable Australia|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/businessman-dick-smith-joins-political-party-sustainable-australia/news-story/a4ae0a963bae260775522762db9e15fd|website=Herald Sun|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Total liberationism''' is a political movement that combines [[anarchism]] with a commitment to animal and earth liberation. Whilst more conventional approaches to anarchist politics have often focused primarily on opposing the state and capitalism, the struggle for total liberation is additionally concerned with opposing all additional forms of human oppression, as well as the oppression of nonhuman animals and ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;David N. Pellow (2014) ''Total Liberation: The Power and Promise of Animal Rights and the Radical Earth Movement''; Minneapolis, USA: University of Minnesota Press, pp.5-6&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of total liberation typically espouse a holistic and [[intersectional]] revolutionary strategy aimed at using [[direct action]] to dismantle all forms of domination and social hierarchy, common examples of which include [[the state]], [[capitalism]], [[patriarchy]], [[racism]], [[heterosexism]], [[cissexism]], [[disablism]], [[ageism]], [[speciesism]], and ecological domination.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Best (2014) ''The Politics of Total Liberation: Revolution for the 21st century'', New York City, USA: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and key concerns ==
Following a period of general inactivity after the Second World War, anarchism reemerged as a force in global politics during the 1960s. This new era of anarchist struggle was distinguished, however, by its adoption of a range of concerns - such as [[feminism]], [[anticolonialism]], [[queer liberation]], [[antispeciesism]], and [[ecology]] - that were previously of little or no concern for most anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;
Uri Gordon (2007) ''Anarchism and Political Theory: Contemporary Problems'', Submitted to the Department of Politics &amp; International Relations in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (retrieved from theanarchistlibrary.org) pp.44-50&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the involvement by anarchists in the animal and earth liberation movements was characterized, in part, by the rising popularity of [[veganism]] within radical circles (something that has been grounded in concerns for both animal rights and environmentalism),&lt;ref&gt;Brian A. Dominick (1997) ''Animal Liberation and Social Revolution: A vegan perspective on anarchism, or an anarchist perspective on veganism'' (retrieved from theanarchistlibrary.org)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the formation of direct action groups such as the [[Hunt Saboteurs Association]], [[Earth First!]], the [[Animal Liberation Front]], and the [[Earth Liberation Front]].&lt;ref&gt;anonymous (2003) "Down with the Empire! Up with the Spring!", ''Do or Die'', issue 10&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of total liberation then began to be used by anarchists during the 1990s in an explicit attempt to clarify important connections between all forms of oppression, and to situate the often isolated political movements against them within a single overall struggle. Moreover, a commitment to total liberation is, beyond its emergence from the historical development of the anarchist movement, also typically grounded in a concern for contemporary schools of political thought such as [[intersectionality]], antispeciesism, [[ecofeminism]], [[deep ecology]], and [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;David N. Pellow &amp; Hollie N. Brehm (2015) "From the New Ecological Paradigm to Total Liberation: The Emergence of a Social Movement Frame"; ''The Sociological Quarterly'', vol. 56, issue 1, pp.191-3 &lt;/ref&gt; As David Pellow summarises:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The concept of total liberation stems from a determination to understand and combat all forms of inequality and oppression. I propose that it comprises four pillars: (1) an ethic of justice and anti-oppression inclusive of humans, nonhuman animals, and ecosystems; (2) anarchism; (3) anti-capitalism; and (4) an embrace of direct action tactics.&lt;ref&gt;D. Pellow (2014) pp.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3450">A '''traffic barricade'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traffic Barricades|url=http://www.sourcesecurity.com/products-search-results/barricades.html|publisher=sourcesecurity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[barricade]] fitted with flashing lights and used to block excavations or [[road construction]] or other safety-related purposes. Formerly made of wood, or wood and steel, many now have structural members made wholly of plastic or [[composite materials]].
* The ''A-frame barricade'' or ''parade barricade'' resembles a [[sawhorse]] with a brightly painted top rail.
* The ''Type I (or II) barricade'' also known as a ''waffle-board barricade'' resembles a sawhorse that can be folded flat. Type I indicates sheeting on top; Type II has sheeting on top and bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trans-supply.com/p-346-type-i-ii-solid-plastic-board-barricades.aspx |title=Traffic Barricade, Type I Barricade, Type II Barricade, Solid Plastic Board Barricade |publisher=Trans Supply |date= |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Likely a USDOT or ISO standard --&gt;
* The ''Type III barricade'' has multiple rails supported by two end posts
Type I, II and III barricades are commonly used for road detours and closings where vehicles are present.  A-Frame barricades are more typically seen where pedestrian traffic control is needed or used on low speed roads.

In addition to the more traditional traffic barricades mentioned above there are several other categories of barricades&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traffic Barricades|url=http://www.trafficsafetywarehouse.com/Barricades/departments/1/|publisher=trafficsafetywarehouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; that get used quite regularly for traffic channelization including concrete barriers, jersey barriers (may be water filled or plastic), traffic barrels or drums and vertical panels.  Depending on space and need all of these categories are listed as acceptable barricade devices in the MUTCD (Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Edition Chapter 6F. Temporary Traffic Control Zone Devices|url=https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009/part6/part6f.htm|publisher=mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traffic barrels and vertical panels are often used in areas where there is less horizontal space but they serve the same purpose - to help control the flow of traffic and protect workers.

One large multi-[[U.S. state|state]] company providing traffic barricade services was [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]-based, [[Highway Technologies|Highway Technologies, Inc.]], a [[United States|US]] construction company that maintained offices in 33 cities.&lt;ref name=dp20130518&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_23269104/highway-technologies-closed-its-doors-friday-before-colfax Traffic-barrier company closes its doors day before Colfax Marathon], 18 May 2013, ''Denver Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It filed for [[bankruptcy]] in May 2013, laying off 740 of its 825 employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/business/economy/article/Construction-supply-company-closes-doors-lays-4553731.php Construction supply company closes doors, lays off 740], 28 May 2013, ''Houston Chronicle''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Union of Councils for Jews in the Former Soviet Union''' ('''UCSJ''') is a [[non-governmental organization]] that reports on the human rights conditions in countries throughout [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]], exposing hate crimes and assisting communities in need. UCSJ uses grassroots-based monitoring and advocacy, as well as humanitarian aid, to protect the political and physical safety of [[Jewish]] people and other minorities in the region. UCSJ is based in [[Washington, D.C.]], and is linked to other organizations such as the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]]. It has offices in Russia and Ukraine and has a collegial relationship with human rights groups that were founded by the UCSJ in the countries of the former Soviet Union.

The UCSJ was formed in 1970 as part of the [[Movement to Free Soviet Jewry]], a response to the [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|oppression of Jews in the Soviet Union]] and other countries of the [[Soviet bloc]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucsj.org/our-work/history/ History of UCSJ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Activities of the UCSJ include reporting on the human rights situation in countries of the former Soviet Union, assisting communities in need, providing support for [[asylum seekers]] and [[Immigration|migrants]], and exposing [[human rights violation]]s and [[hate crime]]s, whether directed against [[Jew]]s or other minorities in the region, such as [[Romani people|Romani]] or [[Muslim]]s. According to a UCSJ report in 2013 approximately 1.71 million Jews remained in the post-Soviet states at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucsj.org/2013/07/03/report-estimated-jewish-population-in-the-former-soviet-union-fsu/ Report: Estimated Jewish Population in the former Soviet Union (FSU)]. (July 3, 2013). Union of Councils for Soviet Jews. Retrieved 2015-09-24. The report states that the figures were "compiled by researcher Allan Miller," without further explanation.&lt;/ref&gt; The reports it produces on the situation in various countries are often presented to the [[US State Department]].

==Leadership==
The 2015 leadership of the UCSJ includes Larry Lerner as President, Dr. Leonid Stonov as Director, and Meylakh Shekhet as Director of the L'viv Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Meet Our Staff - UCSJ|url = http://www.ucsj.org/contact-us/meet-our-staff/|website = UCSJ|accessdate = 2015-11-25|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Former presidents include [[Yosef Abramowitz]], [[Pamela Cohen|Pamela Braun Cohen]], and [[Morey Schapira]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pamela Cohen.|url=http://jwa.org/people/cohen-pamela|website=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Leonid Stonov has been involved with the UCSJ since before his emigration to the U.S. in 1990, when he was a prominent [[Refusenik]] and author of the first emigration law in Soviet history, which was presented to the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Meet Our Staff - UCSJ|url = http://www.ucsj.org/contact-us/meet-our-staff/|website = UCSJ|accessdate = 2015-11-25|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Waksberg]] served as National Vice President during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/32685/soviet-jewry-activist-chosen-to-head-bje/|title=Soviet Jewry activist chosen to head BJE  {{!}}  j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California|last=palevsky|first=stacey|website=www.jweekly.com|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
UCSJ has received funding from the [[European Commission]] of the [[European Union]] as part of a three-year project designed to combat [[racism]], [[antisemitism]] and [[islamophobia]] in Eastern European countries.

==Supporters and contributors==
Today, UCSJ supporters and contributors include individuals around the world who are concerned about [[human rights]] transgressions, and the fate of the 1.71 million Jews who still reside in countries of the former Soviet Union. Those wishing to contribute have four options.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucsj.org/donate/ How to Contribute]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cases==

===Statement of UCSJ on alleged antisemitism in the Russian State Duma===
Nineteen members of the [[State Duma]] from [[Motherland (Russia)|Motherland]] and the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist]] party have signed a letter demanding Jewish organizations be banned in Russia. The letter referred to [[Judaism]] as a religion promoting [[ethnic hatred]] and made reference to the [[Shlomo Ganzfried#Kitzur Shulchan Aruch|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]]. In that regard, UCSJ made the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The best example of how far some members of the national parliament are willing to go to demonize minorities came in January 2005, when 19 members of the [[State Duma]] from [[Motherland (Russia)|Motherland]] and the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist]] party signed an open letter to the Prosecutor General’s office demanding that Jewish groups be banned in Russia. The letter referred to [[Judaism]] as a [[Theistic Satanism|“Satanic” religion]] and made reference to the medieval [[Blood libel against Jews|Blood Libel]] (the belief that Jews ritually murder Christian children during [[Passover]] and use their blood to bake matzo). Russian Jewish groups—who have long ago grown accustomed to more modern-day [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] accusations of controlling the media, the financial system, etc.—reacted with horror to this intellectual descent into the [[Barbarian|barbarism]] of the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human+Rights+Caucus/Briefing+Testimonies/06-08-06+Testimony+of+Nickolai+Butkevich+Russia+Religious+Briefing.htm Testimony of Nickolai Butkevich, Research and Advocacy Director, UCSJ: Union of Councils for Jews in the Former Soviet Union] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061227194026/http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human+Rights+Caucus/Briefing+Testimonies/06-08-06+Testimony+of+Nickolai+Butkevich+Russia+Religious+Briefing.htm |date=December 27, 2006 }}.

===The case of Boris Stomakhin===
Former UCSJ president [[Micah H. Naftalin]] condemned the conviction of journalist [[Boris Stomakhin]], who was accused of [[hate speech]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This sentence exposes the underlying hypocrisy of the Russian government's half-hearted struggle against extremist groups and hate speech."  "This month alone, the [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]] refused to investigate the distribution of a neo-Nazi hit list containing the names and addresses of human rights activists whom the authors 'sentenced to death,' a publisher of a newspaper in Ulyanovsk who publicly called for the murder of Jews got a suspended sentence, and three youths who broke the jaw and fractured the skull of the Minister of Culture of the Kabardino-Balkaria Republic while screaming racist slogans were sentenced to just six months to a year in prison. You don't have to agree with Mr. Stomakhin's radical, though non-violent, views on Chechnya to see that his sentence was disproportionate and unjust."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsumonitor.com/stories/112006PR.shtml Press Release: Jewish Activist Convicted in Russia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927014933/http://www.fsumonitor.com/stories/112006PR.shtml |date=September 27, 2007 }}.

A branch of the UCSJ was closed by the [[government of Belarus]] as part of what many observers saw as a wider crackdown on political [[dissent]] in the region. (''main article - [[Human rights in Belarus]]'')

== Recent history ==

=== Magnitsky legislation ===
Sergei Magnitsky was a lawyer in Moscow ford an international financial company.  He advised the Russian authorities that the tax agents he was dealing with was stealing US$320 million from Russia.  He was arrested, tortured and eventually killed by the Russian authorities.  The Russian Human rights NGOs wanted to support a bill in the US Congress to punish those responsible for his torture and murder by denying them visas to the US and freezing their assets in the US.  The UCSJ supported the legislation at the behest of the Russian NGOs and put together a coalition of international religious freedom organizations to petition the Congress.  The State department fought against the legislation and the Jewish establishment organizations opposed the bills, until they saw that it was going to pass and then publicly supported the bills.  The [[Magnitsky Act]] has been used by President Obama to punish Russia for violations of human rights today.

=== US grants ===
UCSJ was given a grant by US Ambassador to Moscow to bring together Russian pro-democracy human rights with their US counterparts to aid the NGOs in their work.

The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) granted UCSJ grants to monitor human rights violations and anti-semitism and the actions of the Russian Judicial system. The UCSJ sponsored a trip to the Ukraine when the Russians were trying to take over Eastern Ukraine by meeting with high Ukrainian government officials to see if the UCSJ could help.

=== Lviv office of the UCSJ ===
Meylach Schochetl heads the UCSJ office in Lviv.  In addition to running a soup kitchen for the poor of Lviv and running Jewish services for the Jews of Lviv, he has taken on the task of working to protect Jewish historical sites and to fight for human rights.  He has been successful in lawsuits against the authorities in Lviv to preserve cemetery sites and destroyed synagogues from commercialization. He has also been successful in pursuing actions against officials who violated the human rights of individuals.

The '''United Nations Development Group''' ('''UNDG''') is a consortium of many [[United Nations]] agencies, created by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] in 1997 to improve the effectiveness of UN development activities at the country level.

Its strategic priorities are to respond to the Triennial comprehensive policy review (TCPR) – which became in 2008 the [[Quadrennial comprehensive policy review]] (QCPR) – and global development priorities, as well as to ensure the UN development system becomes more internally focused and coherent. The UNDG strategic priorities give direction to UNDG members' efforts at the global, regional and country level to facilitate a step change in the quality and impact of UN support at the country level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://undg.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/UNDG-Strategic-Priorities-2013-2016-December-2014-update-for-2015-2016.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318212821/https://undg.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/UNDG-Strategic-Priorities-2013-2016-December-2014-update-for-2015-2016.pdf |archive-date=2015-03-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the UNDG is one of the main UN actors involved in the development of the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://undg.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/UNDG-Vision-and-Framework-for-Action-for-UN-Operational-Activities-in-....pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305000908/https://undg.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/UNDG-Vision-and-Framework-for-Action-for-UN-Operational-Activities-in-....pdf |archive-date=2016-03-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNDG brings together 32 UN agencies and groups, plus five observers working on various development issues. 

== History ==
By 1997, there were calls within the United Nations to draw all UN agencies working on development issues together; for the many UN Development Programmes, Funds, and Specialised Agencies were encroaching upon each other's activities.&lt;ref&gt;Stokke, O., 2009, The UN and Development: From Aid to Cooperation, Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, p.403-404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klingebiel, S., 1998, Effectiveness And Reform of The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), German Development Institute Book Series No. 13, London: Frank Cass&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially so with the [[Delivering as One]] initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undg.org/home/guidance-policies/delivering-as-one/|title=UNDG » Delivering as One|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328040148/https://undg.org/home/guidance-policies/delivering-as-one/|archive-date=28 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An initial proposal was to merge [[UNICEF]], the [[World Food Programme]] and the [[UNFPA]] into the UNDP. Finally, then Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] worked to form the UNDG and won praise from then UNDP Administrator [[James Speth]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Leadership and organization ==

=== Structure ===
The UNDG is one of the three pillars of the UN system [[United_Nations_System#Chief_Executives_Board_and_Senior_Management_Group|Chief Executives Board]] (CEB), which furthers coordination and cooperation on a wide range of substantive and management issues facing UN system organizations. The CEB brings the executive heads of UN organizations together on a regular basis under the chairmanship of the Secretary-General. Within the CEB structure, the High-Level Committee on Management works on system-wide administrative and management issues, the High-Level Committee on Programmes considers global policy issues, while the United Nations Development Group deals with operational activities for development with a focus on country-level work.

The Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) chairs the UNDG. The UNDG Chair reports to the Secretary-General and the CEB on progress in implementing the group’s work plan, and on the management of the [[Resident Coordinator]] System.

* [[Achim Steiner]] (2017- )

=== UNDG Advisory Group ===
Under Kemal Derviş' leadership, an "Advisory Group", which provides the UNDG Chair with advice and guidance on managing the operational dimensions of the UNDG and the [[Resident Coordinator]] System, was established.&lt;ref name="structures" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undg.org/docs/9526/UNDG_AG_compostion.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214084647/http://www.undg.org/docs/9526/UNDG_AG_compostion.pdf |archivedate=February 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the non-rotational members of the advisory group were: the FAO, ILO, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNHCR, WFP, WHO and UNIDO. The rotational  members (for a period of one year, as of 2016) are: the UNCTAD (representing UNEP, UN Habitat and UNODC) and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Africa (representing all five Regional Commissions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://undg.org/home/about-undg/chair-advisory-group/ |title=UNDG Advisory Group Membership |accessdate=May 31, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328040617/https://undg.org/home/about-undg/chair-advisory-group/ |archive-date=March 28, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }} UNDG Chair and Advisory Group&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development Coordination Office ===
The UN Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) is a key component within the UNDG, promoting social and economic progress by providing support. It was key part of UNDG's formation in 1997, uniting the UN system and improve the quality of its development assistance. Coordination leads to more strategic UN support for national plans and priorities, makes operations more efficient, reduces [[transaction cost]]s for governments, and ultimately helps people attain the [[Millennium Development Goals]] and other internationally agreed development objectives. At present  is the Secretariat and technical and advisory support unit of the UNDG. It brings together the UN development system to promote change and innovation to deliver together on sustainable development. DOCO works under the leadership of the UNDG Chair and guidance of the UNDG. The team provides field evidence to inform policy, facilitates the achievement of shared results, and promotes excellence in UN leadership and coordination. The core objective is a relevant and impactful UN contribution to development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undg.org/home/about-undg/doco/|title=UNDG » Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO)|publisher=United Nations Development Group|accessdate=31 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328040118/https://undg.org/home/about-undg/doco/|archive-date=28 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees''' ('''UNHCR'''; {{lang-fr|Haut Commissariat des Nations unies pour les réfugiés}}) (Also known as  is '''the UN Refugee Agency''') is a [[United Nations]] programme with the mandate to protect [[refugee]]s, forcibly displaced communities and stateless people, and assist in their [[voluntary return|voluntary repatriation]], local integration or [[third country resettlement|resettlement to a third country]]. 

UNHCR was created in 1950, during the aftermaths of [[World War II]]. Its headquarters are in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] and it is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 UNDG Members] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511144047/http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |date=11 May 2011 }}.

== History ==
[[File:Genf UNHCR.JPG|right|thumb|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]
Following the demise of the [[League of Nations]] and the formation of the United Nations the international community was acutely aware of the [[refugee crisis]] following the end of [[World War II]].  In 1947, the [[International Refugee Organization]] (IRO) was founded by the United Nations.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4214cb4f2.html Refworld | Self-Study Module 1: An Introduction to International Protection. Protecting Persons of Concern to UNHCR]. Unhcr.org (1 August 2005). Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The IRO was the first international agency to deal comprehensively with all aspects of refugees' lives. Preceding this was the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]], which was established in 1944 to address the millions of people displaced across Europe as a result of World War II.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt;

In the late 1940s, the IRO fell out of favor, but the UN agreed that a body was required to oversee global refugee issues. Despite many heated debates in the General Assembly, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was founded as a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly by Resolution 319 (IV) of the United Nations General Assembly of December 1949. However, the organization was only intended to operate for 3 years, from January 1951, due to the disagreement of many UN member states over the implications of a permanent body.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt;

UNHCR's mandate was originally set out in its statute, annexed to resolution 428 (V) of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] of 1950. This mandate has been subsequently broadened by numerous resolutions of the General Assembly and its [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC).&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt; According to UNHCR,

&lt;blockquote&gt;[its] mandate is to provide, on a non-political and humanitarian basis, international protection to refugees and to seek permanent solutions for them.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Soon after the signing of the [[1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]], it became clear that refugees were not solely restricted to Europe. In 1956, UNHCR was involved in coordinating the response to the uprising in [[Hungary]]. Just a year later, UNHCR was tasked with dealing with Chinese refugees in Hong Kong, while also responding Algerian refugees who had fled to [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]] in the wake of [[Algeria]]'s war for independence. The responses marked the beginning of a wider, global mandate in refugee protection and [[humanitarian assistance]].&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt;

Decolonization in the 1960s triggered large refugee movements in Africa, creating a massive challenge that would transform UNHCR; unlike the refugee crises in Europe, there were no durable solutions in Africa and many refugees who fled one country only found instability in their new country of asylum. By the end of the decade, two-thirds of UNHCR's budget was focused on operations in Africa and in just one decade, the organization's focus had shifted from an almost exclusive focus on Europe.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt;

In 1967, the [[Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees]] was ratified to remove the geographical and temporal restrictions of UNHCR under the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]]. As the Convention was confined to the refugee crisis in the aftermath of World War II in Europe, the Protocol was made to address the “new refugee situations that have arisen since the Convention was adopted and the refugees concerned that may therefore not fall within the scope of the Convention”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/StatusOfRefugees.aspx|title=Convention relating to the Status of Refugees|website=www.ohchr.org|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, UNHCR refugee operations continued to spread around the globe, with the mass exodus of East Pakistanis to [[India]] shortly before the birth of [[Bangladesh]]. Adding to the woes in Asia was the [[Vietnam war]], with millions fleeing the war-torn country.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt;

The 1980s saw new challenges for UNHCR, with many member states unwilling to resettle refugees due to the sharp rise in refugee numbers over the 1970s. Often, these refugees were not fleeing wars between states, but inter-ethnic conflict in newly independent states. The targeting of civilians as military strategy added to the displacement in many nations, so even 'minor' conflicts could result in a large number of displaced persons. Whether in Asia, Central America or Africa, these conflicts, fueled by superpower rivalry and aggravated by socio-economic problems within the concerned countries, durable solutions continued to prove a massive challenge for the UNHCR. As a result, the UNHCR became more heavily involved with assistance programs within refugee camps, often located in hostile environments.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt;

The end of the [[Cold War]] marked continued inter-ethnic conflict and contributed heavily to refugee flight. In addition, humanitarian intervention by multinational forces became more frequent and the media began to play a big role, particularly in the lead up to the 1999 [[NATO]] mission in [[Yugoslavia]], while by contrast, the [[1994 Rwandan Genocide]] had little attention. The genocide in Rwanda caused a massive refugee crisis, again highlighting the difficulties for UNHCR to uphold its mandate, and the UNHCR continued to battle against restrictive asylum policies in so called 'rich' nations.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt;

[[File:UNHCR DADAAB REGION, KENYA AFRICA DOD 2006.JPEG|thumb|UNHCR packages containing tents, tarps, and mosquito netting sit in a field in [[Dadaab]], Kenya, on 11 December 2006, following disastrous flooding]]
UNHCR was established on 14 December 1950&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646cbc.html|title=History of UNHCR: A global humanitarian organization of humble origins|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and succeeded the earlier [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]]. The agency is mandated to lead and co-ordinate international action to protect refugees and resolve refugee problems worldwide. Its primary purpose is to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees. It strives to ensure that everyone can exercise the right to [[asylum seeker|seek asylum]] and find safe refuge in another state, with the option to [[voluntary return|return home voluntarily]], integrate locally or to [[third country resettlement|resettle in a third country]].

UNHCR's mandate has gradually been expanded to include protecting and providing humanitarian assistance to whom it describes as other persons "of concern," including [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs) who would fit the legal definition of a [[refugee]] under the 1951 United Nations [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] and 1967 Protocol, the 1969 [[OAU Convention|Organization for African Unity Convention]], or some other treaty if they left their country, but who presently remain in their country of origin. UNHCR presently has major missions in [[Lebanon]], [[South Sudan]], [[Chad]]/[[Darfur]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]] as well as [[Kenya]] to assist and provide services to IDPs and [[refugee camp|refugees in camps]] and in [[urban refugee|urban settings]].

UNHCR maintains a database of refugee information, ProGres, which was created during the [[Kosovo War]] in the 1990s. The database today contains data on over 11 million refugees, or about 11% of all displaced persons globally. The database contains biometric data, including [[fingerprint]]s and [[Iris recognition|iris scans]] and is used to determine aid distribution for recipients. The results of using biometric verification has been successful. When introduced in Kenyan refugee camps of [[Kakuma]] and [[Dadaab]] in the year 2013, the [[World Food Programme|UN World Food Programme]] was able to eliminate $1.4m in waste and fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21716637-technology-has-made-migrating-europe-easier-over-time-it-will-also-make-migration|title=Phones are now indispensable for refugees|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve its mandate, the UNHCR engaged in activities both in the countries of interest and in countries with donors. For example, the UNHCR hosts expert roundtables to discuss issues of concern to the international refugee community.

=== Palestine refugee mandate ===
{{Main article|United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East}}
The “United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East” (UNRWA) has a different definition of "refugee" than the UNHCR, including not only original ″Palestine Refugees″ themselves but their descendants (in patriarchal line) in perpetuity; however, it only covers refugees stemming from the [[Arab–Israeli War (disambiguation)|1948 and 1967 Arab-Israeli wars]].

=== Public awareness ===
[[File:UNHCR Stamps of Tajikistan 2001.jpg|thumb|UNHCR 50th anniversary. Stamp of Tajikistan, 2001.]]

Several new programs have recently been introduced to support and to heighten awareness of the issues faced by refugees around the world. These two new programs are a product of the benchmarks set out by the [[United Nations Millennium Development Goals]].

The UNHCR works in different regions of the world to raise awareness about the refugee crisis and the needs of these refugees.

Since 2009, the UNHCR acknowledged a large presence of migration and refugees in the [[Caribbean]], where the refugee crisis remained largely unreported.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/latest/2011/2/4d5d27676/unhcr-caribbean-partners-work-raise-awareness-invisible-refugees.html|title=UNHCR and Caribbean partners work to raise awareness of "invisible" refugees|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|newspaper=UNHCR|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many refugees in search for asylum in the United States are unable to reach their destination and end up in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ftp.jamaicagleaner.com/power/14496|title=UNHCR discuss plight of refugees in Caribbean|website=ftp.jamaicagleaner.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, migrant laws in most of these nations lacked any protections for [[Asylum seeker|asylum-seeker]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, even the ability to be recognized as a refugee or asylum seeker itself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The UNHCR organized talks with these nations in [[Costa Rica]] in 2009,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; in an effort to bring forward the lack of protections for refugees, who are often labeled as "illegal" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and prosecuted as unauthorized migrants.

In 2007, UNHCR offices in Canada launched an aggressive media campaign to shed light on the plight of refugees.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/latest/2007/5/464884684/canadian-made-refugee-awareness-campaign-aims-shock.html|title=Canadian-made refugee awareness campaign aims to shock|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|newspaper=UNHCR|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign was meant to humanize the refugee crisis by showing refugees living in the midst of disturbing conditions. Using emotional appeals to raise public awareness, the campaign hoped to increase the interest of particularly "30 to 45-year-old professionals who are generally well educated, well read, but have not had direct experience or knowledge of refugee issues,”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; according to fund-raising officer Jonathan Wade.

In Ireland, the UNHCR works to inform the public through different channels. The UNHCR in Ireland actively pursues media relations and "[they] supply the media with accurate and reliable information coupled with our unique insight based on our refugee protection mandate and role as one of the world’s leading humanitarian agencies".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.ie/our-work-in-ireland/building-awareness|title=Building Awareness|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|website=www.unhcr.ie|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also engages its community by holding public events in aims of informing people of current refugee crises. One of these is the annual UNHCR/SARI Fair play Football Cup.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Cooperation within the United Nations ===
As UNHCR is a program governed by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]], and the [[UN Economic and Social Council]], it cooperates with many other programs and agencies under the United Nations in order to effectively protect the rights of refugees.

On 19 September 2016, [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] hosted the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants, a high-level summit to address large movements of refugees and migrants, with the aim of bringing countries together behind a more humane and coordinated approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://refugeesmigrants.un.org/summit|title=Summit for Refugees and Migrants - 19 September 2016|date=2014-12-12|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders of the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]], [[UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women]], [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UN Office on Drugs and Crime]], and The [[World Bank]] were present. The summit addressed the root causes and drive for migration and the necessity of global cooperation. As a result of this summit, the United Nations unveiled a draft set of principles that urge the international community to build on the momentum set by the adoption of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (2016).&lt;ref name="NY_DEC_REF-MIG_2016"&gt;{{cite web |title=New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants |url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/71/1 |website=un.org |publisher=UN |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_NY_DEC_2016"&gt;{{cite web |title=New York Declaration |url=https://refugeesmigrants.un.org/declaration |website=un.org |publisher=UN |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the 20 draft principles focus on human rights; non-discrimination; rescue and assistance; access to justice; border governance; returns; violence; detention; family unity; child migrants; women migrants; right to health; adequate standard of living; decent work; right to education; right to information; monitoring and accountability; migrants’ human rights defenders; data; and international cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54978#.V-xRGvCLQ2w|title=UN News - UN official unveils draft principles on protecting human rights of refugees and migrants|last=Section|first=United Nations News Service|date=2016-09-20|website=UN News Service Section|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 2016, the UNHCR partnered with the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agricultural Organization]] in Tehran for the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees. FAO highlighted the contributions to be made by FAO towards SSAR objectives on livelihood related activities including livestock and fishery initiatives as well as nutritional projects in Iranian schools.

FAO and UNHCR are committed to increasing refugees’ access to livelihood opportunities and reducing dependency on humanitarian aid. Of late, a joint livelihood strategy for South Sudan&amp;nbsp;was launched looking to address this issue with a clearly defined action plan. The strategy targets both refugees (70 percent) and local communities (30 percent) in refugee-hosting areas across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/africa/news/detail-news/en/c/417501/|title=UNHCR and FAO help vulnerable refugees and South Sudanese families strengthen their food security|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awards ===
Since 1954, the [[Nansen Refugee Award|UNHCR Nansen Refugee Award]] has been annually awarded to a person or an organization in recognition of outstanding service to the cause of refugees, displaced or stateless people.

The UNHCR itself was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1954 and 1981. The UNHCR has been chosen for the prestigious Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development 2015.

In 1991 was awarded with the prestigious [[Prince of Asturias Awards#International Cooperation (Cooperación Internacional)|Prince of Asturias Award for International Cooperation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fpa.es/en/princess-of-asturias-awards/laureates/1991-unhcr-united-nations-high-comissioner-for-refugees.html?especifica=0|title=UNHCR (United Nations High Comissioner for Refugees) - Laureates - Princess of Asturias Awards - The Princess of Asturias Foundation|last=Tecnologías|first=Developed with webControl CMS by Intermark|work=The Princess of Asturias Foundation|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Persons of concern to UNHCR ==

The UNHCR's Mid-Year Trends report of June 2015 (based on information for mid-2015 or latest available information up to that date) reported an "unprecedented" 57,959,702 individuals falling under its mandate (for reference, on January the 1st, 2007, 21,018,589 people - or less than half of the number in 2015 - fell under the mandate of the UNHCR). The sharp increase was mainly attributed to the [[Syrian Civil War]], "with the outbreak of armed crises or the deterioration of ongoing ones in countries like [[Afghanistan]], [[Burundi]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Mali]], [[Somalia]], [[South Sudan]] and the [[Ukraine]] contributing to prevailing trends."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

A '''web presence''' is a location on the [[World Wide Web]] where a person, business, or some other entity is represented (see also [[web property]] and [[point of presence]]).

Examples of a web presence for a person could be a personal [[website]], a [[blog]], a profile page, a wiki page, or a [[social media]] [[point of presence]] (e.g. a LinkedIn profile, a Facebook account, or a Twitter account). Examples of a web presence for a business or some other entity could be a corporate website, a [[microsite]], a page on a review site, a wiki page, or a social media point of presence (e.g., a LinkedIn company page and/or group, a Facebook business/brand/product page, or a Twitter account).

Every web presence is associated with a unique [[web address]] to distinguish one point of presence from another.

==Owned vs. unowned==
Web presence can either be owned or unowned. [[Earned media|Owned media]] exists when a single person or group can control the content that is published on its web presence (e.g. a corporate website or a personal Twitter account). However, when a single person or group cannot solely control the content, the creator is different from the owner. This is considered unowned media (see [[earned media]]). A Wikipedia or Yelp page about a person, company, or product would be an example of an unowned (or "earned") web presence.

Occasionally, a third form of media known as "paid media" is often included in the discussion of media types: "earned vs. owned vs. paid". Paid media is commonly found in the form of advertisements, but it is not considered a form of web presence.

==Management==
Web presence management is the process of establishing and maintaining a digital footprint on the web. The three factors that are considered include the following: ''where'' a person or business has web presence; ''how'' each web presence represents its enterprise; and ''what'' is published at a point of presence.

Web presence management is the discipline of determining and governing:
* the distribution of policy documents
* which platforms are most appropriate (e.g. internal vs. external blog, YouTube vs. Vimeo)
* the single inventory of personal or corporate web presence (e.g. partners or advocates)
* where on the web a business and any relatable assets are represented
* where on the web a business and any relatable assets are impersonated or pirated
* web properties with the particular entities they represent
* who has control over which web properties
* new web properties which are not in the personal or corporate inventory (e.g. someone creates a new presence)
* authorized and unauthorized changes to the creation (e.g. branding) of a web presence
* a workflow for creating a web property that follows its corporate standards

===Management system===
The purpose of a web presence management system is to manage the web presence of a person or business. This includes the collection of domain names, websites, social media, and other web pages where he, she, or it is being represented. The tool generally offers the following key functions: new presence discovery, inventory management, change detection, access control, stakeholder coordination, and compliance workflow.

A web presence management system is meant to have a broader reach so that it emphasizes where a presence has been established, will be established, must be maintained, or must be remediated. An example of a web presence management system is the Brandle Presence Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberson|first1=Chip|url=http://www.brandle.net/blog/2013/11/social-presence-vs-social-content|title=Social Content vs. Social Presence - Don't neglect your social footprint|publisher=Brandle, Inc.|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to publish content to the various points of web presence, multiple [[content management system]]s and sometimes even [[social media]] [[management system]]s are often used. The primary focus of most content and social media management systems is limited to their specific web platforms.

===Domain names===
Another aspect of web presence management is managing the collection of [[domain name]]s registered to the person or business. Any entity may register multiple domain names for the same property. As a result, they can link alternative spellings, different [[top-level domain]]s, aliases, brands, or products to the same website. Similarly, negative or derogatory domain names may also be registered. This is done to prevent certain domain names from being used against the person or business.

It is common for a larger business to have domain names registered by multiple employees at multiple [[domain name registrar]]s, possibly a result of organizational or geographical requirements. Consequently, a web presence management system can be used to monitor all domain names registered by the business, regardless of the registrars used.

==Discovery==
Web presence discovery is the process of monitoring the web for a new point of presence about a person or business. Web presence discovery is often included in a web presence management system. Whether a new domain is registered, a new website is published, or a new social media account is established, it occurs outside of the person’s or business’ control. As a result, its purpose is to assess a new point of presence and appropriately handle any violations.

It is important to note that web presence discovery differs from content listening. The former involves looking for new properties on the web, whereas the latter refers to analyzing content that already exists to hear how a person or business is seen often in near real time. Examples of content listening systems include [[Sysomos]] and Radian6, which is now a subsidiary of [[Salesforce.com]].

===Brand protection===
A person or business may choose to watch for a new web presence that might appear to misrepresent or mislead an audience, such as counterfeiters, spoofers, or malicious hackers. One of the early software in the online brand protection marketplace was [[MarkMonitor]], now part of [[Thomson Reuters]]. This software helped detect rogue domain names and websites.

However, the modern day growth of social media has seen a rise in the number of fraudulent brand impersonations. It has become much easier for a new web presence to be created on those platforms, which results in a greater frequency of them today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reputation@Risk - 2014 global survey on reputation risk|url=http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Governance-Risk-Compliance/gx_grc_Reputation@Risk%20survey%20report.pdf|website=Deloitte|publisher=Deloitte|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Risk Management Survey 2015|url=http://www.aon.com/2015GlobalRisk/default.jsp|website=AON|publisher=AON|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="17th Annual Global CEO Survey"&gt;{{cite web|title=17th Annual Global CEO Survey|url=http://read.pwc.com/i/243985-pwcs-17th-annual-global-ceo-survey|website=PwC|publisher=PwC|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ey.com/US/en/Issues/Governance-and-reporting/Audit-Committee/BoardMatters-Quarterly---April-2014---4---The-business-of-social-media |title=BoardMatters Quarterly, April 2014 - The business of social media - EY - United States |publisher=EY |date= |accessdate=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board Matters Quarterly - Critical insights for today’s audit committee|url=http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY_-_Board_Matters_Quarterly,_April_2014/$FILE/ey-BMQ-April-2014-Balancing-the-risks-and-rewards-of-digital-technology.pdf|publisher=Ernst &amp; Young LLP|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a preventative measure, online brand protection providers are now adding social media to their domain and website discovery options.

===Security===
The widespread growth of social media has also made it easier for unauthorized individuals to impersonate an employee. Consequently, social media has now become a recognized threat vector in that it can be used to [[Social engineering (security)|socially engineer]] an attack on a business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinkley|first1=Chris|title=Social Media Makes Way for Social Engineering|url=http://www.securityweek.com/social-media-makes-way-social-engineering|website=SecurityWeek|publisher=Wired Business Media|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bradley|first1=Tony|title=Think twice before you accept that 'friend' request|url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/2137134/social-engineering/think-twice-before-you-accept-that--friend--request.html|website=CSO|publisher=CXO Media, Inc.|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counter this, companies are able to use web presence monitoring tools to detect new points of presence on the web and thereby defend against socially engineered attacks.&lt;ref name="17th Annual Global CEO Survey"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foster|first1=James|title=A CISO's Nightmare: Digital Social Engineering|url=http://www.securityweek.com/cisos-nightmare-digital-social-engineering|website=SecurityWeek|publisher=Wired Business Media|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security for social networking|url=http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/it-risk-security/assets/social-networking-final.pdf|website=PwC|publisher=PwC|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andreesen|first1=Tom|last2=Slemp|first2=Cal|title=Managing Risk in a Social Media-Driven Society|url=http://www.protiviti.com/en-US/Documents/Insights/Managing-Risk-in-a-Social-Media-Driven-Society.pdf|website=Protiviti|publisher=Protiviti, Inc.|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distributed inventory management===
A web presence monitoring system can be used by a business to associate a new web property with its corporate inventory. It is designed to address autonomous, distributed behaviors. This usually applies to larger businesses whose geographically diverse employees are more prone to creating new points of presence on the web. For example, a retail chain may allow each local store to create and manage their web presence to market to and communicate with their local customer base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberson|first1=Chip|title=Social Media for the Retail Industry - Going Local and Liking It!|url=http://www.brandle.net/blog/2013/10/social-media-retail-industry-going-local-liking|website=Brandle|publisher=Brandle, Inc.|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a global business may have teams in each country or region who create and manage a web presence to adapt to local languages or cultures.

==Monitoring==
Web presence monitoring is the process of monitoring a known inventory of web presence to detect any changes that are made. Web presence monitoring is often included in a web presence management system and can serve multiple purposes for both larger corporations and certain individuals, such as celebrities.

It is important to note that presence monitoring differs from content listening. The former involves monitoring the properties (e.g. branding) of a web property in an established inventory, whereas the latter refers to analyzing content that already exists to hear how a person or business is seen often in near real time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Survey of Bank Compliance Officers|url=http://www.aba.com/Press/Pages/073015BankComplianceOfficerSurvey.aspx|website=ABA|publisher=American Bankers Association|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, presence monitoring focuses on owned media and content listening on earned media.

===Corporate, brand, and regulatory compliance===
Many companies ensure that certain standards are met for a property on the web that represents their business. For companies in regulated industries, such as finance and healthcare, the company may be required by law to ensure that all publicized content, regardless of platform or technology, follow specific requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Media: Consumer Compliance Risk Management Guidance|url=https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/financial/2013/fil13056a.pdf|website=FDIC|publisher=FFIEC|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Media Compliance Isn’t Fun, But It’s Necessary|url=https://hbr.org/2012/08/social-media-compliance-isnt|website=Harvard Business Review|publisher=Harvard Business School Publishing|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulatory Notice 10-06|url=http://www.finra.org/file/regulatory-notice-10-06|website=FINRA|publisher=FINRA|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread growth of social media has seen a rise in the number of fraudulent corporate impersonations. It has become much easier for a new web presence to be created on these platforms, and so these are much more prevalent than they used to be.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a preventative measure, a web presence monitoring system alerts the company when a known property is changed, allowing for the property to be reviewed and amended so that it follows the proper standards.
.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Church|first1=Janet|last2=Roberson|first2=Chip|title=Social Media Risks and Rewards|url=http://www.scotsmanguide.com/Residential/Articles/2014/06/Social-Media-Risks-and-Rewards/|website=Scotsman Guide|publisher=Scotsman Guide Media|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A web presence monitoring system helps alert the company when a known property is changed, so it can be reviewed and brought back, if necessary, into compliance with the appropriate standards.

==Audit==
A '''web presence audit''' is performed by an enterprise to determine that all [[Point of presence|points of presence]] on the web meet the objectives as well as [[governance, risk management, and compliance]] (GRC) needs. To ensure neutrality, these audits are often conducted as part of an [[information technology audit]] by a [[professional services]] agency or an internal audit team. However, a less formal web presence audit is often performed by internal members as a routine to meet GRC objectives.

A web presence audit usually includes web presence discovery and a review of all web-based content in the business’ inventory of web presence. Even though web presence monitoring is not performed in a web presence audit, a review of the nature and scope of the company's web presence monitoring policies, procedures, and tools is considered.

===Social media audit===
Due to the emerging challenges introduced by the dynamic nature of social media, a business may choose to perform specific '''social media audits''' in greater frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Juergens|first1 = Michael|title = Social Media Risks Create an Expanded Role for Internal Audit|url = http://deloitte.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2013/08/06/social-media-risks-create-an-expanded-role-for-internal-audit/|website = Wall Street Journal|accessdate = 10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Dowie|first1 = Jon|title = EMERGING TECHNOLOGY RISKS - Social Media - Internal Audit’s response|url = https://www.kpmg.com/BE/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/Social%20Media_ITIA's%20response.pdf|website = KPMG|accessdate = 10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A social media audit is similar to a web presence audit, but may also include the purposes of maintaining an accurate inventory of all business social media points of presence. Alternatively, the business may choose to employ automated web presence discovery and compliance systems to keep the corporate social media inventory up-to-date and compliant with GRC needs.

==Web presence vs. web reputation management==
[[Reputation management|Reputation management systems]] are often associated with web presence management. Web presence management is knowing ''where'' an individual or business is represented, whereas [[reputation management]] is knowing ''what'' people are saying about an individual or business. Web presence management handles owned media, while reputation management systems with earned media.

Both systems offer some similar degree of remediation. For web presence management systems, remediation would include finding counterfeit properties that infringe on a brand or trademark. For reputation management systems, remediation would include identifying and eliminating misleading reviews and/or encouraging the contribution of authentic comments.

Even though a web presence monitoring tool can help identify unowned web properties where people are talking about a person, product, or brand, it is only part of the solution. A reputation management system often includes a content listening system to monitor the stream of messages about a particular subject which may be coming from any point of presence on the web (e.g. a comment about a product by a customer on her personal Twitter account). For examples of some [[:Category:Reputation management companies|reputation management companies, click here]].

An '''electoral wipeout''' occurs when a major party receives far fewer votes or seats in a Legislature than their position justifies. It is the opposite of a [[landslide victory]]; the two frequently going hand in hand.

Note that the use of the phrase generally assumes that the returns were the product of a legitimate election; [[show elections]] to fraudulent legislatures regularly produce incredibly strong majorities for the ruling party(s).

== Australia ==
Between 1901 and 1949, the upper house of the [[Australian Senate]] was elected by a system of majoritarian or "winner-take-all" voting. Each state had 3 of its 6 Senators retiring at each half-senate election. Each voter had 3 votes at each election, whether by first-past-the-post ([[FPTP]]) 1901-1918, or the [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]]. It was often the case that the 3 seats all went the same way, leading to lopsided results in the six states such as 36-0 or 3-33. These results brought the parliament into some disrepute.

In 1948, the [[Single Transferable Vote]] (STV) was introduced. At the same time, the number of senators per state was increased from 6 to 10, with 5 instead of 3 retiring at each triennial election. The increased number of vacancies per election would have exacerbated the "landslide/wipeout" effect if the old winner-take-all system had been retained. Instead, having more seats ''increased'' the degree of proportionality between votes received and seats won by parties.

Since the introduction of STV in the Senate, the parties have generally been evenly balanced, with minor parties and independents holding the balance of power. While frustrated, the government in the lower house has had a lot of different people to negotiate with.

In the 2004 election, the government did the nearly impossible and gained the 57% of the vote in one state to obtain a majority in its own right in the senate from July 2005, when the new senators take up their seats. The number of quotas required to win a majority (four) of six seats, at 57% (four-sevenths of the votes), is so high because there are an even number of seats.

In the lower house, FPTP was changed to preferential voting in 1918.

In the 1974 Queensland state election, using single-member electorates and [[Instant-runoff voting|full-preferential voting]], the Labor opposition was reduced to a "[[cricket]] team" of eleven MPs, against the National Country Party/ Liberal Party Coalition government with 69 seats (and 2 Independents).

== Canada ==
* In the [[Canadian federal election, 1993]], the governing [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] was reduced from a strong majority government to only two seats.
* In the [[Canadian federal election, 2011]], the [[Bloc Québécois]] was reduced to 4 seats.  
* In the [[Canadian federal election, 2015]], the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] won all seats in the Atlantic Provinces.

* [[Saskatchewan general election, 1944]] 53.1% - 35.4%    47 - 5  (wipe out)
* [[Saskatchewan general election, 1934]] 48.0% - 24.0%    50 - 5  (wipe out)

==Germany==
The use of an [[electoral threshold]] in German elections means that sometimes a major party can fail to win seats in the [[Bundestag]] or a state parliament, either because their vote share falls below 5% or because the number of directly-elected seats drops below 3. Post-war examples include:

* [[West German federal election, 1957]]: The [[All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights]] lost all 27 seats.
* [[German federal election, 2002]]: The [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] went from 36 seats to just 2 (both directly-elected).
* [[German federal election, 2013]]: The [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] lost all 93 seats.

==New Zealand==
Until it moved to a [[proportional representation]] system in 1996, general elections in New Zealand were also prone to the possibility of wipeouts, though these in general involved the likelihood of third parties getting few or no seats rather than one of the two major parties being massively underrepresented. This former circumstance occurred most starkly in the [[New Zealand general election, 1981|1981 general election]], in which the [[Social Credit Party (New Zealand)|Social Credit Party]] gained 20.6% of the vote yet gained only two seats in the 92-seat parliament.

The [[New Zealand general election, 1935|1935 general election]] did, however, see a major party wipeout, and led to the creation of a new major party. In the 1935 election, the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] gained 46.1% of the vote to the [[United/Reform Coalition]]'s 32.9%, but won 53 seats to the United/Reform's 19. As a result of this election the two coalition parties merged to form the [[National Party of New Zealand|National Party]], which remains a major force in current New Zealand politics.

==United Kingdom==
*In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] were wiped out in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] - losing eleven and six seats respectively. The Conservatives failed to pick up a seat in Wales in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 election]] either. The Conservatives picked up a seat in Scotland in 2001, but they didn't gain any additional MPs until 2017, while their share of the vote remained below 20%.
*In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005 (Northern Ireland)|United Kingdom general election, 2005]], the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], which had been Northern Ireland's largest party, lost 5 of its 6 seats. Its last seat was lost at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010 (Northern Ireland)|2010 election]], leaving it without representation for the first time since the party was created in 1912.
*In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015]], the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] lost 49 of their 57 seats, and despite taking 8% of the national vote only had 1.2% of the MPs. Both Labour and the Lib Dems were nearly wiped out in Scotland, retaining just one seat each.

===Scottish Elections===
The [[Scottish Parliament]] elections uses a version of the [[Additional member system]], meaning that 73 seats are won through [[First Past the Post]] constituency votes, and additional seats are added for the regional vote which uses a variation of the [[D'Hondt method]].
*In the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2007]], the [[Scottish Socialist Party|Socialists]] lost all of their six seats, with their share of the vote reduced by over 6%.
*In the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2011]], [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] lost twenty constituency seats (seven overall), with the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] losing nine (twelve overall). The Lib Dems were left with only two constituency seats, suffering a complete wipeout on the Scottish mainland, leaving only [[Shetland (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Shetland]] and [[Orkney (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Orkney]] (two of the safest seats in the country) with Lib Dem MSPs.

== Elsewhere ==
* [[Philippine Senate election, 1955]]: With the 24-seat [[Senate of the Philippines]] elected via nationwide [[plurality-at-large voting]] (8 votes per voter) and on [[staggered election]]s, the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]'s seven seats were lost when none of their candidates finished eighth place or higher, despite having 29% of the vote. After the election, the [[Nacionalista Party]] then had 21 seats, and two minor parties having 3 seats with one seat vacant.
* In the 2000 Mongolian [[State Great Khural]] Election, the [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] overturned a large majority for the Democratic Union, winning 72 out of the 76 seats contested.
*In the [[Irish general election, 2011|Irish General Election of 2011]], the ruling [[Fianna Fáil]] party suffered the worst defeat in [[History of Fianna Fáil|its history]], returning only 20 [[Teachta Dála|T.D.'s]] to the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]]. The party moved from being the largest party in the [[Republic of Ireland]], to third for the first time ever. Since the formation of the first Fianna Fáil government in [[Irish general election, 1932|1932]], until the 2011 Election, Fianna Fáil had been in power for 61 of those 79 years and had always been the largest party in the state (regardless of whether it was in power or not). Many factors caused the electoral meltdown, but chief among them was the [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|collapse of the Irish economy]].

The '''Zomi Congress for Democracy''' ({{lang-my|ဇိုမီး ဒီမိုကရေစီအဖွဲ့ချုပ်}}; [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''ZCD''') is a [[political party]] in [[Myanmar]]. Most of the party's support comes from [[Chin State]], where the original ZNC was headquartered. The party is most popular in the [[Tonzang Township|Tonzang]] and [[Tedim Township]]s, where their headquarters and strongholds are. The party has 15,000 members in Chin State.&lt;ref name="MMNow"&gt;{{cite web|title=Myanmar Now {{!}} Zomi Congress for Democracy|url=http://www.myanmar-now.org/resources/i/?id=091c08e2-33cf-4e9c-874f-2cdf6200cceb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ZCD was founded as the ''Zomi National Congress'' (ZNC) in [[Daizang]], [[Manipur]], [[India]] in 1972. Under the leadership of T. Gougin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=T. GOUGIN - The Father of the Zo people|url=http://gougin.blogspot.in/|website=gougin.blogspot.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; and S. K. Samte, the organisation campaigned for the unification of the [[Zomi people]] in India and Myanmar, and submitted a [[memorandum]]&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum submitted to His Excellency V.V. GIRI, The President of India by the Zomi National Congress, Lamka {{cite web|url=http://www.zogam.org/documents.asp?article%3Ddocuments_244 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318072300/http://www.zogam.org/documents.asp?article=documents_244 |archivedate=18 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the then [[President of India]] [[V. V. Giri]]. It was a major goal for the ZNC that the first ''World Zomi Convention'' be held at Champhai, Mizoram, India from 19–21 May 1988; a goal which was completed.

In 1988, after the [[8888 uprising]], the ZNC branch in Burma was registered as a political party. It was permitted to function as a political organisation until 1992, when the [[State Peace and Development Council|military junta]] abolished the party, and banned it from all political activities.

Cin Sian Thang, 67, was chairman of the Zomi National Congress, until the party's dissolution. Elected as a Member of Parliament during Burma's ill-fated [[Burmese general election, 1990|1990 elections]], he worked diligently for several years in defiance of the country’s ruling [[State Peace and Development Council|military junta]]. During the 1960s, Cin Sian Thang served as a leader of the Chin Ethnic Student Union while a student at Rangoon University. He has been imprisoned on at least six occasions by successive military regimes for his political activities between 1972 and 1999. In each instance, he served two years, during which he was subjected to brutal interrogations and torture, which has led to permanent health problems. He also served as a member of the Committee Representing People’s Parliament, a group supported by 251 candidates elected in 1990. Considered a moderate ethnic leader, Cin Sian Thang heavily promoted the CRPP as a rallying point for Burmese activists and ethnic leaders. He was the most outspoken elected ethnic leader in Myanmar. He is also the co-author of the book "''In Burma, a Cry for U.N. Help''".&lt;ref&gt;[[Washington Post]], Thursday, 26 October 2006, p. A25&lt;/ref&gt;

The party renamed to the Zomi Congress for Democracy after new naming restrictions imposed by the government leading up to the [[Myanmar by-elections, 2012|2012 by-elections]] required them to drop the word 'National' from their name. The party formally registered this name with the [[Union Election Commission]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinlandguardian.com/index.php/news/item/1364-znc-to-register-as-zomi-congress-for-democracy ZNC to register as the Zomi Congress for Democracy]&lt;/ref&gt;
