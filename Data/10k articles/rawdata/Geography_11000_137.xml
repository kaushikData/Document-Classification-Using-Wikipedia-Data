More than 1,500 [[East Prussia]]n places were ordered to be renamed by 16 July 1938, following a decree issued by ''[[Gauleiter]]'' and ''[[Oberpräsident]]'' [[Erich Koch]] and initiated by [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Wolfsschanze": Hitlers Machtzentrale im Zweiten Weltkrieg|first=Uwe|last=Neumärker|edition=3|publisher=Ch. Links Verlag|year=2007|isbn=3-86153-433-9|language=German|page=202|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the elimination, [[Germanization]], or simplification of a number of [[Old Prussian]] names, as well as those Polish or Lithuanian origin. Other areas of the [[Third Reich]] were also affected.

==East Prussia==

Placenames in [[Masuria]] were occasionally renamed prior to 1938, and indeed even before the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte|volume=51|issue=2|year=2003|title='Grenzlandpolitik' und Ostforschung an der Peripherie des Reiches. Das ostpreußische Masuren 1919-1945|first=Andreas|last=Kossert|pages=117–146, here p. 137|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the district of [[Lötzen]] 47 percent of all villages had already been renamed in the [[Weimar Republic]] and another 36 percent after 1933.&lt;ref name=Kossert/&gt; A systematic renaming campaign was prepared after Koch issued the corresponding order on 25 August 1937.&lt;ref name=Kossert138&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte|volume=51|issue=2|year=2003|title='Grenzlandpolitik' und Ostforschung an der Peripherie des Reiches.

Kossert (2003), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this order, the Prussian Ministry of Science, Education and People's Education (''Ministerium für Wissenschaft, Erziehung und Volksbildung'') set up an expert commission led by Mr Harmjanz (the ''Ministerialrat'' or ministerial adviser).&lt;ref name=Kossert138/&gt; Members included Mr Meyer (a Slavicist from [[Königsberg]]), Mr Ziesemer (a Germanist from Königsberg), Mr Falkenhayn (a lecturer, expert in Lithuanian and Old Prussian names) and [[Max Hein]] (the director of the Königsberg state archives and expert in names of the [[Teutonic Order state]]).&lt;ref name=Kossert138/&gt; Affected were names of villages, water bodies, forests and cadastral districts.&lt;ref name=Kossert138/&gt; In some counties up to 70% of the placenames had been changed by 16 July 1938.&lt;ref name=Kossert138/&gt;

After [[World War II]] the local populace [[Evacuation of East Prussia|fled]] or [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|was expelled]]. The modern Polish names were determined by the [[Commission for the Determination of Place Names]].The names invented in 1938 remain in official use in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=Kossert&gt;{{cite book |title=Masuren – Ostpreussens vergessener Süden|last=Kossert |first=Andreas |author-link=de:Andreas Kossert |language=German |page=323 |isbn=978-3-570-55006-9 |quote="Diese Regelung übernahm dann die 1949 gegründete Bundesrepublik Deutschland, deren Lastenausgleichsämter, Aussiedler- und Flüchtlingslager, Rentenbehörden und Meldeämter weiterhin die germanisierten NS-Formen gebrauchten."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Silesia and other regions==
A similar Germanization of place names was carried out in other regions of the [[Third Reich]], especially in [[Silesia]]. There, 1088 place names in the Oppeln ([[Opole]]) region were changed in 1936, also 359 in the [[Breslau]] (Wroclaw) area and 178 in the [[Liegnitz]] (Legnica) area between 1937 and 1938.&lt;ref name=is/&gt; In the [[Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship|portion]] of Upper Silesia which after World War I had become part of the [[Second Polish Republic]], most places had two locally used names, a German one and a Polish one, and after 1922, Polish authorities made the Polish variants the "official" names.&lt;ref name=is/&gt;

==World War II==
During World War II, renaming occurred primarily in occupied/annexed territories, because the Nazi government felt that ''"foreign language names for places constitute a national threat and may lead to mistaken world opinion in regard to their nationality"''. Areas affected included [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany]], e.g. [[Upper Silesia]] and the area near [[Poznań]].&lt;ref name=is&gt;Monika Choros, Lucja Jarczak, "Relacje polsko niemieckie w nazwach miejscowych" (Polish-German relations in local placenames), [www.instytutslaski.com/www/pliki/relacje.ppt Instytut Slaski]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alsace]], as well as [[Czechoslovakia]] .

The '''Carnarvon Basin''' is a geological [[Sedimentary basin|basin]] located in the [[North West Australia|north west]] of [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ga.gov.au/oceans/rpg_OffNorthWestA.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805184544/http://www.ga.gov.au/oceans/rpg_OffNorthWestA.jsp |archivedate=2008-08-05 |df= }} for a regional perspective&lt;/ref&gt; This is the main geological feature that makes up the [[North West Shelf]]. The onshore part of the Carnarvon Basin covers about 115,000&amp;nbsp;km² and the offshore part covers approximately 535,000&amp;nbsp;km² with water depths up to 3,500 metres. It is separated into two major areas - the Northern Carnarvon Basin, and the Southern Carnarvon Basin.

==Northern Carnarvon Basin==
[[File:Regions of western australia nine plus perth.png|thumb|160px|[[Gascoyne (Western Australia)|Gascoyne]] in [[North West Australia]].]]
The Northern Carnarvon Basin includes the [[Exmouth Plateau]], Wombat Plateau (on the northern part of the Exmouth Plateau), Investigator Sub-basin, Rankin Platform, Exmouth Sub-basin, Barrow Sub-basin, Dampier Sub-basin, Beagle Sub-basin, Enderby Terrace, Peedamullah Shelf and the Lambert Shelf.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.ga.gov.au/oceans/ofnwa_crnvn_ncb.jsp Geoscience Australia - Northern Carnarvon Basin (NCB)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416135418/http://www.ga.gov.au/oceans/ofnwa_crnvn_ncb.jsp |date=April 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main sub-basins for petroleum exploration in the basin have been Dampier, Exmouth and Barrow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ga.gov.au/oceans/ofnwa_crnvn_PetExp.jsp Geoscience Australia - Petroleum exploration (NCB)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321003606/http://www.ga.gov.au/oceans/ofnwa_crnvn_PetExp.jsp |date=March 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Southern Carnarvon Basin==
The Southern basin consists of the Gascoyne, Merlinleigh, Bidgemia and Byro Sub-basins and Bernier Platform and is flanked to the east by the Archaean Pilbara Block.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 

==Impact crater==
The '''Gnargoo structure''', which has remarkable similarities to [[Woodleigh crater]], is a proposed 75 km impact crater on the Gascoyne Platform, Southern Carnarvon Basin with an estimated age of 100-300 Ma.&lt;ref&gt;R.

The [[conservation ethic]] is based on the findings of conservation biology.

== Origins ==

The term conservation biology and its conception as a new field originated with the convening of "The First International Conference on Research in Conservation Biology" held at the [[University of California, San Diego]] in La Jolla, California in 1978 led by American biologists Bruce A. Wilcox and [[Michael E. Soulé]] with a group of leading university and zoo researchers and conservationists including [[Kurt Benirschke]], Sir [[Otto Frankel]], [[Thomas Lovejoy]], and [[Jared Diamond]]. The meeting was prompted by the concern over [[tropical deforestation]], disappearing species, eroding [[genetic diversity]] within species.&lt;ref&gt;J. Douglas. 1978. Biologists urge US endowment for conservation. Nature Vol. 275, 14 September 1978. Kat Williams . 1978. Natural Sciences. Science News. September 30, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference and proceedings that resulted&lt;ref name=ConsBiol80/&gt; sought to initiate the bridging of a gap between theory in ecology and evolutionary genetics on the one hand and conservation policy and practice on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Organization of the meeting itself also entailed bridging a gap between genetics and ecology. Soulé, was an evolutionary geneticist working with wheat geneticist Sir Otto Frankel to advance [[conservation genetics]] as a new field at the time. [[Jared Diamond]], who suggested the idea for a conference to Wilcox was concerned with the application of community ecology and island biogeography theory to conservation. Wilcox and [[Thomas Lovejoy]], who together initiated planning for the conference in June 1977 when Lovejoy secured a commitment of seed funding at [[World Wildlife Fund]], felt both genetics and ecology should be represented. Wilcox suggested use of a new term  ''conservation biology'', complementing Frankel's conception and coining of "conservation genetics",  to encompass the application of biological sciences in general to conservation. Subsequently, Soulé and Wilcox wrote conceived the agenda for the meeting they jointly convened on September 6–9, 1978, titled ''First International Conference on Resesarch in Conservation Biology'', in which the program described "The purpose of this conference is to accelerate and facilitate the development of a rigorous new discipline called conservation biology -- a multidisciplinary field drawing its insights and methodology mostly from population ecology, community ecology, sociobiology, population genetics, and reproductive biology." This inclusion of topics at the meeting related to animal breeding reflected participation and support of the zoo and captive breeding communities.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation biology and the concept of biological diversity ([[biodiversity]]) emerged together, helping crystallize the modern era of conservation science and [[National Environmental Policy Act|policy]].  The inherent multidisciplinary basis for conservation biology has led to new subdisciplines including conservation social science, [[conservation behavior]] and conservation physiology.&lt;ref name="Cooke et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cooke |first1=S.

Conservation biologists research and educate on the trends and process of [[biodiversity loss]], species [[extinction]]s, and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to [[Sustainability|sustain]] the well-being of human society. Conservation biologists work in the field and office, in government, universities, non-profit organizations and industry. The topics of their research are diverse, because this is an interdisciplinary network with professional alliances in the biological as well as social sciences. Those dedicated to the cause and profession [[advocate]] for a global response to [[Holocene extinction|the current biodiversity crisis]] based on [[morals]], [[ethics]], and scientific [[reason]]. Organizations and citizens are responding to the biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales.&lt;ref name="Soule86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groom06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;

=== Natural resource conservation ===

Conscious efforts to conserve and protect ''global'' biodiversity are a recent phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffem.fr/lang/en/accueil-FFEM/activites-ffem/biodiversite_protection|title=Biodiversity protection and preservation|website=www.ffem.fr|access-date=2016-10-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018140452/http://www.ffem.fr/lang/en/accueil-FFEM/activites-ffem/biodiversite_protection|archive-date=2016-10-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural resource conservation, however, has a history that extends prior to the age of conservation. Resource ethics grew out of necessity through direct relations with nature. Regulation or communal restraint became necessary to prevent selfish motives from taking more than could be locally sustained, therefore compromising the long-term supply for the rest of the community.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt; This social dilemma with respect to natural resource management is often called the "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hardin G |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1243–8 |date=December 1968 |pmid=5699198 |url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/dees/V1003/lectures/population/Tragedy%20of%20the%20Commons.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175825/http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/dees/V1003/lectures/population/Tragedy%20of%20the%20Commons.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also considered to be a consequence of evolution, where individual selection is favored over group selection.

From this principle, conservation biologists can trace communal resource based ethics throughout cultures as a solution to communal resource conflict.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt; For example, the Alaskan [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] peoples and the [[Haida people|Haida]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]] had resource boundaries, rules, and restrictions among clans with respect to the fishing of [[sockeye salmon]]. These rules were guided by clan elders who knew lifelong details of each river and stream they managed.&lt;ref name="Dyke08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;Mason, Rachel and Judith Ramos. (2004).

The Mauryan emperor [[Ashoka]] around 250 B.C. issued edicts restricting the slaughter of animals and certain kinds of birds, as well as opened veterinary clinics.

Conservation ethics are also found in early religious and philosophical writings. There are examples in the [[Tao]], [[Shinto]], [[Hindu]], [[Islamic]] and [[Buddhist]] traditions.&lt;ref name="Dyke08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Primack 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last = Primack | first =Richard B. | title = A Primer of Conservation Biology, 3rd ed. | publisher = Sinauer Associates | year= 2004 | pages = 320pp. | isbn = 0-87893-728-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek philosophy, Plato lamented about pasture [[land degradation]]: "What is left now is, so to say, the skeleton of a body wasted by disease; the rich, soft soil has been carried off and only the bare framework of the district left."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, E., and H.

Wilderness was denigrated while agricultural development was praised.&lt;ref name="Evans97"&gt;{{cite book |author=Evans, David |title=A history of nature conservation in Britain |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1997 |isbn=0-415-14491-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as early as AD 680 a [[wildlife sanctuary]] was founded on the [[Farne Islands]] by [[St Cuthbert]] in response to his religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="Dyke08" /&gt;

=== Early naturalists ===

[[File:White Gerfalcons.jpg|thumb|right|upright|White [[gyrfalcon]]s drawn by [[John James Audubon]] ]]

[[Natural history]] was a major preoccupation in the 18th century, with grand expeditions and the opening of popular public displays in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. By 1900 there were 150 natural history museums in [[Germany]], 250 in [[Great Britain]], 250 in the [[United States]], and 300 in [[France]].&lt;ref name="Farber00"&gt;{{cite book |author=Farber, Paul Lawrence |title=Finding order in nature: the naturalist tradition from Linnaeus to E. O. Wilson |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2000 |isbn=0-8018-6390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preservationist or conservationist sentiments are a development of the late 18th to early 20th centuries.

Before Charles Darwin set sail on HMS ''Beagle'', most people in the world, including Darwin, believed in special creation and that all species were unchanged.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biology|last=Mader|first=Sylvia|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|year=2016|isbn=978-0-07-802426-9|location=New York, NY|page=262|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; George-Louis Leclerc was one of the first naturalist that questioned this belief. He proposed in his 44 volume natural history book that species evolve due to environmental influences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Erasmus Darwin was also a naturalist who also suggested that species evolved. Erasmus Darwin noted that some species have vestigial structures which are anatomical structures that have no apparent function in the species currently but would have been useful for the species' ancestors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The thinking of these early 18th century naturalist helped to change the mindset and thinking of the early 19th century naturalist.

By the early 19th century [[biogeography]] was ignited through the efforts of [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Charles Lyell]] and [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web2.uwindsor.ca/courses/biology/macisaac/55-437/intro.htm|title=Introduction to Conservation Biology and Biogeography|website=web2.uwindsor.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century fascination with natural history engendered a fervor to be the first to collect rare specimens with the goal of doing so before they became extinct by other such collectors.&lt;ref name="Evans97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farber00" /&gt; Although the work of many 18th and 19th century naturalists were to inspire nature enthusiasts and [[Environmental organization|conservation organizations]], their writings, by modern standards, showed insensitivity towards conservation as they would kill hundreds of specimens for their collections.&lt;ref name="Farber00" /&gt;

=== Conservation movement ===
{{Main article|Conservation movement}}

The modern roots of conservation biology can be found in the late 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period particularly in [[England]] and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Evans97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cloyd"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Cloyd | first = E.

Scientific conservation principles were first practically applied to the forests of [[British India]]. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the [[Natural environment|environment]], that there was a [[civic duty]] to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir [[James Ranald Martin]] was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in [[British India]] through the establishment of [[Indian Forest Service|Forest Departments]].&lt;ref&gt;Stebbing, E.P (1922)''The forests of India'' vol. 1, pp. 72-81&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Madras]] Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by [[Alexander Gibson (botanist)|Alexander Gibson]], a professional [[botany|botanist]] who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state conservation management of forests in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WDYlNljAP5AC|title=Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism|first1=Greg |last1=Barton|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48|isbn=978-1-139-43460-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to [[British empire|other colonies]], as well the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/11/05/stories/2007110550080500.htm|title=A life for forestry|last=MUTHIAH|first=S. |date=Nov 5, 2007|work=Metro Plus Chennai|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2009-03-09|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleghorn|first=Hugh Francis Clarke |title=The Forests and Gardens of South India |publisher=W.

The term ''conservation'' came into widespread use in the late 19th century and referred to the management, mainly for economic reasons, of such natural resources as [[timber]], fish, game, [[topsoil]], [[pasture]]land, and minerals. In addition it referred to the preservation of [[forest]]s ([[forestry]]), [[wildlife]] ([[wildlife refuge]]), parkland, [[wilderness]], and [[Drainage basin|watersheds]]. This period also saw the passage of the first conservation legislation and the establishment of the first nature conservation societies.

=== Global conservation efforts ===

In the mid-20th century, efforts arose to target individual species for conservation, notably efforts in [[big cat]] conservation in [[South America]] led by the New York Zoological Society.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Rabinowitz, ''Jaguar: One Man's Battle to Establish the World's First Jaguar Preserve'', Arbor House, New York, N.Y. (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century the New York Zoological Society was instrumental in developing concepts of establishing preserves for particular species and conducting the necessary conservation studies to determine the suitability of locations that are most appropriate as conservation priorities; the work of Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr., [[Carl E. Akeley]], [[Archie Carr]] and his son Archie Carr III is notable in this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carr, Marjorie Harris |author2=Carr, Archie Fairly |title=A naturalist in Florida: a celebration of Eden |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=1994 |isbn=0-300-05589-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/chronob/OSBO1887.htm|title=Chrono-Biographical Sketch: (Henry) Fairfield Osborn, Jr.|website=www.wku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}&lt;!-- The timings of these two sentences contradict each other. --&gt; Akeley for example, having led expeditions to the [[Virunga Mountains]] and observed the [[mountain gorilla]] in the wild, became convinced that the species and the area were conservation priorities. He was instrumental in persuading [[Albert I of Belgium]] to act in defense of the [[mountain gorilla]] and establish [[Albert National Park]] (since renamed [[Virunga National Park]]) in what is now [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;Akeley, C., 1923. ''In Brightest Africa'' New York, Doubleday. 188-249.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, led primarily by work in the United States under the [[Endangered Species Act]]&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Endangered Species Act (7 U.S.C. § 136, 16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq.) of 1973, Washington DC, U.S. Government Printing Office&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[Species at Risk Act]] (SARA) of Canada, [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s developed in [[Australia]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], hundreds of species specific protection plans ensued. Notably the United Nations acted to conserve sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of mankind. The programme was adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] in 1972. As of 2006, a total of 830 sites are listed: 644 cultural, 162 natural. The first country to pursue aggressive biological conservation through national legislation was the United States, which passed back to back legislation in the Endangered Species Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1531-|title=16 U.S. Code § 1531 - Congressional findings and declaration of purposes and policy|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1966) and [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&amp;docid=Cite:+42USC4321|title=US Government Publishing Office - FDsys - Browse Publications|website=frwebgate.access.gpo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; which together injected major funding and protection measures to large-scale habitat protection and threatened species research. Other conservation developments, however, have taken hold throughout the world. India, for example, passed the [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul R. |last1=Krausman |first2=A. J. T. |last2=Johnsingh |year=1990 |title=Conservation and Wildlife Education in India |journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=342–7 |jstor=3782224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, a significant development was the emergence of the [[urban wildlife|urban conservation]] movement. A local organization was established in [[Birmingham]], [[UK]], a development followed in rapid succession in cities across the UK, then overseas. Although perceived as a [[grassroots movement]], its early development was driven by academic research into urban wildlife. Initially perceived as radical, the movement's view of conservation being inextricably linked with other human activity has now become mainstream in conservation thought. Considerable research effort is now directed at urban conservation biology. The [[Society for Conservation Biology]] originated in 1985.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

By 1992, most of the countries of the world had become committed to the principles of conservation of biological diversity with the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiv.org/convention/default.shtml Convention on Biological Diversity Official Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227072411/http://www.biodiv.org/convention/default.shtml |date=2007-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently many countries began programmes of [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s to identify and conserve threatened species within their borders, as well as protect associated habitats. The late 1990s saw increasing professionalism in the sector, with the maturing of organisations such as the [[Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management]] and the [[Society for the Environment]].

Since 2000, the concept of [[landscape scale conservation]] has risen to prominence, with less emphasis being given to single-species or even single-habitat focused actions. Instead an ecosystem approach is advocated by most mainstream conservationists, although concerns have been expressed by those working to protect some high-profile species.

Ecology has clarified the workings of the [[biosphere]]; i.e., the complex interrelationships among humans, other species, and the physical environment. The [[Human overpopulation|burgeoning human population]] and associated [[agriculture]], [[industry]], and the ensuing pollution, have demonstrated how easily ecological relationships can be disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gore, Albert |title=Earth in the balance: ecology and the human spirit |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=1992 |isbn=0-395-57821-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring extinction rates ===
{{annotated image/Extinction|float=right}}

Extinction rates are measured in a variety of ways. Conservation biologists measure and apply [[statistical measure]]s of [[fossil record]]s,&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Regan |first1=Helen M. |last2=Lupia |first2=Richard |last3=Drinnan |first3=Andrew N. |last4=Burgman |first4=Mark A. |title=The Currency and Tempo of Extinction |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=157 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |year=2001 |pmid=18707231 |doi=10.1086/317005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rates of [[habitat loss]], and a multitude of other variables such as loss of biodiversity as a function of the rate of habitat loss and site occupancy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacKenzie |first1=Darryl I. |last2=Nichols |first2=James D. |last3=Hines |first3=James E. |last4=Knutson |first4=Melinda G. |last5=Franklin |first5=Alan B. |title=Estimating Site Occupancy, Colonization, and Local Extinction When a Species Is Detected Imperfectly |journal=Ecology |volume=84 |issue=8 |year=2003 |pages=2200–2207 |jstor=3450043 |doi=10.1890/02-3090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain such estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Balmford |first1=Andrew |last2=Green |first2=Rhys E. |last3=Jenkins |first3=Martin |title=Measuring the changing state of nature |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=18 |issue=7 |year=2003 |pages=326–30 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00067-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacArthur|first1=R.H.|author-link1= Robert MacArthur|last2=Wilson|first2=E.O.|author-link2= E. O. Wilson|title=[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]] |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=2001 |isbn=0-691-08836-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is possibly the most significant contribution toward the scientific understanding of both the process and how to measure the rate of species extinction. The current [[background extinction rate]] is estimated to be one species every few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Raup DM |title=A kill curve for Phanerozoic marine species |journal=Paleobiology |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=37–48 |year=1991 |pmid=11538288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure of ongoing species loss is made more complex by the fact that most of the Earth's species have not been described or evaluated. Estimates vary greatly on how many species actually exist (estimated range: 3,600,000-111,700,000)&lt;ref name="Wilson00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = Edward O. | year = 2000 | title = On the Future of Conservation Biology | url = | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 1–3 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.00000-e1.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; to how many have received a [[Binomial nomenclature|species binomial]] (estimated range: 1.5-8 million).&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt; Less than 1% of all species that have been described beyond simply noting its existence.&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt; From these figures, the IUCN reports that 23% of [[vertebrate]]s, 5% of [[invertebrate]]s and 70% of plants that have been evaluated are designated as [[endangered]] or [[threatened]].&lt;ref name="IUCN"&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 IUCN Red-list statistics (2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630054235/http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 |date=June 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The IUCN does not disaggregate endangered from [[critically endangered]] or threatened for the purpose of these statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Better knowledge is being constructed by [[The Plant List]] for actual numbers of species.

=== Systematic conservation planning ===

Systematic conservation planning is an effective way to seek and identify efficient and effective types of reserve design to capture or sustain the highest priority biodiversity values and to work with communities in support of local ecosystems. Margules and Pressey identify six interlinked stages in the systematic planning approach:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Margules CR, Pressey RL |title=Systematic conservation planning |journal=Nature |volume=405 |issue=6783 |pages=243–53 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10821285 |doi=10.1038/35012251 |url=http://www.ecology.uq.edu.au/docs/SoC_Brazil_2005/Papers/Margules_and_Pressey_2000.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225013400/http://www.ecology.uq.edu.au/docs/SoC_Brazil_2005/Papers/Margules_and_Pressey_2000.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Compile data on the biodiversity of the planning region
# Identify conservation goals for the planning region
# Review existing conservation areas
# Select additional conservation areas
# Implement conservation actions
# Maintain the required values of conservation areas

Conservation biologists regularly prepare detailed conservation plans for [[Grant (money)|grant proposals]] or to effectively coordinate their plan of action and to identify best management practices (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070704172505/http://www.amphibians.org/newsletter/ACAP.pdf Amphibian Conservation Action Plan] is one example. See also: {{cite journal |vauthors=Chan KM, Shaw MR, Cameron DR, Underwood EC, Daily GC |title=Conservation Planning for Ecosystem Services |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=e379 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17076586 |pmc=1629036 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040379 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040379}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Systematic strategies generally employ the services of [[Geographic Information Systems]] to assist in the decision making process.

=== Conservation physiology: a mechanistic approach to conservation ===

Conservation physiology was defined by [[Steven J. Cooke]] and colleagues as: 'An integrative scientific discipline applying physiological concepts, tools, and knowledge to characterizing biological diversity and its ecological implications; understanding and predicting how organisms, populations, and ecosystems respond to environmental change and stressors; and solving conservation problems across the broad range of taxa (i.e. including microbes, plants, and animals). Physiology is considered in the broadest possible terms to include functional and mechanistic responses at all scales, and conservation includes the development and refinement of strategies to rebuild populations, restore ecosystems, inform conservation policy, generate decision-support tools, and manage natural resources.'&lt;ref name="Cooke et al 2013"/&gt;  Conservation physiology is particularly relevant to practitioners in that it has the potential to generate cause-and-effect relationships and reveal the factors that contribute to population declines.

=== Conservation biology as a profession ===

The [[Society for Conservation Biology]] is a global community of conservation professionals dedicated to advancing the science and practice of conserving biodiversity. Conservation biology as a discipline reaches beyond biology, into subjects such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[economics]], [[humanities]], [[arts]], [[anthropology]], and [[education]].&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groom06" /&gt; Within biology, [[conservation genetics]] and [[evolution]] are immense fields unto themselves, but these disciplines are of prime importance to the practice and profession of conservation biology.

Is conservation biology an [[Objectivity (science)|objective science]] when biologists [[advocate]] for an inherent [[Ecosystem valuation|value in nature]]? Do conservationists introduce [[bias]] when they support policies using qualitative description, such as [[Habitat degradation|habitat ''degradation'']], or ''healthy'' [[ecosystem]]s? As all scientists hold values, so do conservation biologists. Conservation biologists advocate for reasoned and sensible management of natural resources and do so with a disclosed combination of [[science]], [[reason]], [[logic]], and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] in their conservation management plans.&lt;ref name="Hunter96" /&gt; This sort of advocacy is similar to the medical profession advocating for healthy lifestyle options, both are beneficial to human well-being yet remain scientific in their approach.

There is a movement in conservation biology suggesting a new form of leadership is needed to mobilize conservation biology into a more effective discipline that is able to communicate the full scope of the problem to society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manolis JC, Chan KM, Finkelstein ME, Stephens S, Nelson CR, Grant JB, Dombeck MP |title=Leadership: A new frontier in conservation science |journal=Conserv. Biol. |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement proposes an adaptive leadership approach that parallels an [[adaptive management]] approach. The concept is based on a new philosophy or leadership theory steering away from historical notions of power, authority, and dominance. Adaptive conservation leadership is reflective and more equitable as it applies to any member of society who can mobilize others toward meaningful change using communication techniques that are inspiring, purposeful, and collegial. Adaptive conservation leadership and mentoring programs are being implemented by conservation biologists through organizations such as the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leopoldleadership.org/content/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217231043/http://leopoldleadership.org/content|archive-date=2007-02-17|title=Aldo Leopold Leadership Program|publisher=Woods Institute for the Environment, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approaches ===

Conservation may be classified as either [[in-situ conservation]], which is protecting an endangered species in its natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]], or [[ex-situ conservation]], which occurs outside the natural habitat.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kala |first1=Chandra Prakash |title=Medicinal plants conservation and enterprise development |journal=Medicinal Plants - International Journal of Phytomedicines and Related Industries |volume=1 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=79–95 |doi=10.5958/j.0975-4261.1.2.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In-situ conservation involves protecting or restoring the habitat. Ex-situ conservation, on the other hand, involves protection outside of an organism's natural habitat, such as on reservations or in gene banks, in circumstances where viable populations may not be present in the natural habitat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Also, non-interference may be used, which is termed a [[Environmentalism|preservationist]] method. Preservationists advocate for giving areas of nature and species a protected existence that halts interference from the humans.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; In this regard, conservationists differ from preservationists in the social dimension, as conservation biology engages society and seeks equitable solutions for both society and ecosystems. Some preservationists emphasize the potential of biodiversity in a world without humans.{{quote|text=|sign=|source=|"Animals have not yet invaded 2/3 of Earth's habitats, and it could be that without human influence the diversity of tetrapods will continue to increase in an exponential fashion."}}

=== Ethics and values ===
{{See also|Conservation (ethic)|Land ethic}}

Conservation biologists are [[interdisciplinary]] researchers that practice ethics in the biological and social sciences. Chan states&lt;ref name="Chan08"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chan |first1=Kai M. A. |title=Value and Advocacy in Conservation Biology: Crisis Discipline or Discipline in Crisis? |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |year=2008 |pmid=18254846 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00869.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; that conservationists must advocate for biodiversity and can do so in a scientifically ethical manner by not promoting simultaneous advocacy against other competing values.

A conservationist may be inspired by the ''resource conservation ethic'',&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|15}} which seeks to identify what measures will deliver "the greatest good for the greatest number of people for the longest time."&lt;ref name="Hunter96" /&gt;{{Rp|13}} In contrast, some conservation biologists argue that nature has an [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] that is independent of [[anthropocentric]] usefulness or [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|3,12,16–17}} Intrinsic value advocates that a gene, or species, be valued because they have a utility for the ecosystems they sustain. [[Aldo Leopold]] was a classical thinker and writer on such conservation ethics whose philosophy, ethics and writings are still valued and revisited by modern conservation biologists.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}}

=== Conservation priorities ===

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has organized a global assortment of scientists and research stations across the planet to monitor the changing state of nature in an effort to tackle the extinction crisis. The IUCN provides annual updates on the status of species conservation through its Red List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627094911/http://www.iucnredlist.org/ |archivedate=2014-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IUCN Red List]] serves as an international conservation tool to identify those species most in need of conservation attention and by providing a global index on the status of biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Vié09"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 =Vié  | first1 = J.

Concerns for biodiversity loss covers a broader conservation mandate that looks at ecological processes, such as migration, and a holistic examination of biodiversity at levels beyond the species, including genetic, population and ecosystem diversity.&lt;ref name="Molnar04"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Molnar |first = J. |last2 = Marvier |first2 = M. |last3 = Kareiva |first3 = P. |title = The sum is greater than the parts |journal = Conservation Biology |volume = 18 |issue = 6 |pages = 1670–1 |year = 2004 |url = http://www.environmental-expert.com/Files%5C8392%5Carticles%5C9961%5CTheSumIsGreaterthantheParts.pdf |doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00l07.x |ref = harv }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive, systematic, and rapid rates of biodiversity loss threatens the sustained well-being of humanity by limiting supply of ecosystem services that are otherwise regenerated by the complex and evolving holistic network of genetic and ecosystem diversity. While the [[conservation status]] of species is employed extensively in conservation management,&lt;ref name="Vié09" /&gt; some scientists highlight that it is the common species that are the primary source of exploitation and habitat alteration by humanity. Moreover, common species are often undervalued despite their role as the primary source of ecosystem services.&lt;ref name="Gaston10"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.1182818 | last=Gaston | first=K.J. | title=Valuing common species | journal=Science | volume=327 | issue=5962 | pages=154–155 | year=2010 | isbn= | pmid=20056880 | ref=harv|bibcode = 2010Sci...327..154G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kearns10"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kearns |first1=Carol Ann |year=2010 |title=Conservation of Biodiversity |journal=Nature Education Knowledge |volume=3 |issue=10 |page=7 |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/conservation-of-biodiversity-13235087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most in the community of conservation science "stress the importance" of [[sustainability|sustaining biodiversity]],&lt;ref name="CREOcare"&gt;Committee on Recently Extinct Organisms. "[http://creo.amnh.org/care.html Why Care About Species That Have Gone Extinct?]". URL accessed July 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; there is debate on how to prioritize genes, species, or ecosystems, which are all components of biodiversity (e.g. Bowen, 1999). While the predominant approach to date has been to focus efforts on endangered species by conserving ''[[biodiversity hotspots]]'', some scientists (e.g)&lt;ref name="Luck03"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luck |first1=Gary W. |last2=Daily |first2=Gretchen C. |last3=Ehrlich |first3=Paul R. |title=Population diversity and ecosystem services |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=18 |issue=7 |year=2003 |pages=331–6 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00100-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and conservation organizations, such as the [[Nature Conservancy]], argue that it is more cost-effective, logical, and socially relevant to invest in ''biodiversity coldspots''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turner |first1=Will R. |last2=Brandon |first2=Katrina |last3=Brooks |first3=Thomas M. |last4=Costanza |first4=Robert |last5=da Fonesca |first5=Gustavo A. B. |last6=Portela |first6=Rosimeiry |title=Global Conservation of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services |journal=BioScience |volume=57 |issue=10 |year=2007 |pages=868–73 |doi=10.1641/B571009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The costs of discovering, naming, and mapping out the distribution of every species, they argue, is an ill-advised conservation venture. They reason it is better to understand the significance of the ecological roles of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Molnar J, Marvier M, Karieva P |title=The sum is greater than the parts |journal=Conserv. Biol. |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=1670–1 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00l07.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity hotspots and coldspots are a way of recognizing that the spatial concentration of genes, species, and ecosystems is not uniformly distributed on the Earth's surface. For example, "[...] 44% of all species of vascular plants and 35% of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4% of the land surface of the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Myers |first1=Norman |last2=Mittermeier |first2=Russell A. |last3=Mittermeier |first3=Cristina G. |last4=da Fonseca |first4=Gustavo A.

Those arguing in favor of setting priorities for coldspots point out that there are other measures to consider beyond biodiversity.

=== Strategic species concepts ===

==== Keystone species ====
{{Main article|Keystone species}}

Some species, called a ''keystone species'' form a central supporting hub unique to their ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/keystone-species/|title=keystone species|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-01-21|newspaper=National Geographic Society|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of such a species results in a collapse in ecosystem function, as well as the loss of coexisting species.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Keystone species are usually predators due to their ability to control the population of prey in their ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; The importance of a keystone species was shown by the extinction of the [[Steller's sea cow]] (''Hydrodamalis gigas'') through its interaction with [[sea otter]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[kelp]]. [[Kelp bed]]s grow and form nurseries in shallow waters to shelter creatures that support the [[food chain]]. Sea urchins feed on kelp, while sea otters feed on sea urchins. With the rapid decline of sea otters due to [[overhunting]], sea urchin populations [[urchin barren|grazed unrestricted]] on the kelp beds and the ecosystem collapsed. Left unchecked, the urchins destroyed the shallow water kelp communities that supported the Steller's sea cow's diet and hastened their demise.&lt;ref&gt;P. K. Anderson. (1996). Competition, predation, and the evolution and extinction of Steller's Sea Cow, ''Hydrodamalis gigas''. Marine Mammal Science, 11(3):391-394&lt;/ref&gt; The sea otter was thought to be a keystone species because the coexistence of many ecological associates in the kelp beds relied upon otters for their survival. However this was later questioned by Turvey and Risley,&lt;ref name=pmid17148336&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turvey |first1=S.T |last2=Risley |first2=C.L |title=Modelling the extinction of Steller's sea cow |journal=Biology Letters |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=94–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17148336 |pmc=1617197 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who showed that hunting alone would have driven the Steller's sea cow extinct.

==== Indicator species ====
{{Main article|Indicator species}}

An ''indicator species'' has a narrow set of ecological requirements, therefore they become useful targets for observing the health of an ecosystem. Some animals, such as [[amphibian]]s with their semi-permeable skin and linkages to [[wetland]]s, have an acute sensitivity to environmental harm and thus may serve as a ''[[Miner's canary|miner's canary]]''. Indicator species are monitored in an effort to capture environmental degradation through pollution or some other link to proximate human activities.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Monitoring an indicator species is a measure to determine if there is a significant environmental impact that can serve to advise or modify practice, such as through different forest [[silviculture]] treatments and management scenarios, or to measure the degree of harm that a [[pesticide]] may impart on the health of an ecosystem.

Government regulators, consultants, or [[NGO]]s regularly monitor indicator species, however, there are limitations coupled with many practical considerations that must be followed for the approach to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Landres PB, Verner J, Thomas JW |title=Ecological Uses of Vertebrate Indicator Species: A Critique |journal=Conserv. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=316–28 |year=1988 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/emc/nfma/includes/2007_rule/1988_12_Landres%20et%20al%201988.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1988.tb00195.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally recommended that multiple indicators (genes, populations, species, communities, and landscape) be monitored for effective conservation measurement that prevents harm to the complex, and often unpredictable, response from ecosystem dynamics (Noss, 1997&lt;ref name="Meffe97"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carroll, C.

==== Umbrella and flagship species ====
{{Main article|Umbrella species|Flagship species}}

An example of an ''umbrella species'' is the [[monarch (butterfly)|monarch butterfly]], because of its lengthy [[Insect migration|migrations]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] value. The monarch migrates across North America, covering multiple ecosystems and so requires a large area to exist. Any protections afforded to the monarch butterfly will at the same time umbrella many other species and habitats. An umbrella species is often used as ''flagship species'', which are species, such as the [[giant panda]], the [[blue whale]], the [[tiger]], the [[mountain gorilla]] and the monarch butterfly, that capture the public's attention and attract support for conservation measures.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Paradoxically, however, conservation bias towards flagship species sometimes threatens other species of chief concern.&lt;ref&gt;Fedriani JM, García L, Sanchéz M, Calderon J, and C Ramo. 2017.

=== Status of oceans and reefs ===
{{See also|Ocean|Coral reef|Marine pollution|Marine conservation}}

Global assessments of coral reefs of the world continue to report drastic and rapid rates of decline. By 2000, 27% of the world's coral reef ecosystems had effectively collapsed. The largest period of decline occurred in a dramatic "bleaching" event in 1998, where approximately 16% of all the coral reefs in the world disappeared in less than a year. ''[[Coral bleaching]]'' is caused by a mixture of [[environmental stress]]es, including increases in ocean temperatures and [[Ocean acidification|acidity]], causing both the release of [[symbiotic]] [[algae]] and death of corals.&lt;ref name="ausSOE01"&gt;{{cite book |title=Australia state of the environment 2001: independent report to the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment and Heritage |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |location=Collingwood, VIC, Australia |year=2001 |isbn=0-643-06745-0 |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2001/publications/report/pubs/part03b.pdf |author=Australian State of the Environment Committee.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decline and extinction risk in coral reef biodiversity has risen dramatically in the past ten years.

The oceans are threatened by acidification due to an increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels. This is a most serious threat to societies relying heavily upon oceanic [[natural resource]]s. A concern is that the majority of all [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] species will not be able to [[Evolution|evolve]] or [[acclimate]] in response to the changes in the ocean chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Society. 2005.

The prospects of averting mass extinction seems unlikely when "[...] 90% of all of the large (average approximately ≥50 kg), open ocean tuna, billfishes, and sharks in the ocean"&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; are reportedly gone. Given the scientific review of current trends, the ocean is predicted to have few surviving [[multi-cellular organism]]s with only [[microbes]] left to dominate [[marine ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

=== Groups other than vertebrates ===

The greatest bulk of [[biomass]] on land is found in plants, which is sustained by insect relations. This great ecological value of insects is countered by a society that often reacts negatively toward these aesthetically 'unpleasant' creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Edward O. |title=The Little Things That Run the world (The Importance and Conservation of Invertebrates) |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=1 |issue=4 |year=1987 |pages=344–6 |jstor=2386020 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1987.tb00055.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Samways |first1=Michael J. |title=Insects in biodiversity conservation: some perspectives and directives |journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |volume=2 |issue=3 |year=1993 |pages=258–82 |doi=10.1007/BF00056672 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One area of concern in the insect world that has caught the public eye is the mysterious case of missing [[honey bee]]s (''Apis mellifera''). Honey bees provide an indispensable ecological services through their acts of pollination supporting a huge variety of agriculture crops. The use of honey and wax have become vastly used throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Society, National Geographic. "Honeybee." National Geographic. National Geographic, n.d.

However, in  16-month period from 2006 through 2007, 29% of 577 [[beekeeper]]s across the United States reported CCD losses in up to 76% of their colonies. This sudden demographic loss in bee numbers is placing a strain on the agricultural sector. The cause behind the massive declines is puzzling scientists. [[Pest (organism)|Pests]], [[pesticide]]s, and [[global warming]] are all being considered as possible causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holden |first1=C. |title=Ecology: Report Warns of Looming Pollination Crisis in North America |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5798 |page=397 |year=2006 |pmid=17053115 |doi=10.1126/science.314.5798.397 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stokstad |first1=E. |title=Entomology: The Case of the Empty Hives |journal=Science |volume=316 |issue=5827 |pages=970–2 |year=2007 |pmid=17510336 |doi=10.1126/science.316.5827.970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservation biology of parasites ===
{{Main article|Conservation biology of parasites}}

A large proportion of parasite species are threatened by extinction. A few of them are being eradicated as pests of humans or domestic animals, however, most of them are harmless. Threats include the decline or fragmentation of host populations, or the extinction of host species.

The '''Department of [[Geography]]''' is one of the constituent departments of the '''[[University of Cambridge]]''' and is located on the [[Downing Site]]. The department has long had an international reputation as a leading centre of research and is consistently ranked as one of the best geography departments in the UK. In 2013 the department was ranked by ''[[The Guardian]]'' University Rankings as the best geography undergraduate degree in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2012/may/22/university-guide-geography-environmental-studies University guide 2013: Geography and environmental studies. ''The Guardian'' (22 May 2012)] (accessed 14 May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

There is a long tradition of geography at Cambridge stretching back to the first University Lecturer in Geography appointed in 1888. Teaching was initially for a special examination leading to a diploma in geography. The Geographical [[Tripos]] - the examination for a B.A. degree - was established in 1919. In 1931 the first professor was appointed and in 1933 the department moved into its own accommodation. That building, which now constitutes the eastern end of the department, was considerably extended in the 1930s, with the construction of new lecture theatres and laboratories. In the 1980s, the building was further extended with the addition of a top floor to provide a new laboratory for computing, remote sensing and geographical information systems. In 1999 the department expanded again, to occupy two floors in an adjacent building where new laboratories, seminar rooms and offices are housed.

Since then, the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure and the University of Cambridge Centre for Gender Studies have been integrated into the teaching and research activities of the Department (2001), and the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]] become a sub-department in 2002. Today, the Department has 35 academic staff including ten professors and four readers.

==Research==
[[File:Scott Polar Research Institute - geograph.org.uk - 1480014.jpg|thumb|[[Scott Polar Research Institute]], a sub-department of the Department of Geography]]

Research in the department is organised in the following research clusters:
*Spaces of Economy &amp; Society
*Historical &amp; Cultural Geography
*Society, Environment &amp; Development
*Environmental Processes
*Glacial &amp; Quaternary

==Notable alumni and staff==

The department has produced a large range of notable alumni, including [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], the world's most cited academic geographer, and winner of the [[Lauréat Prix International de Géographie Vautrin Lud]].
Other notable alumni and staff include:

'''DubaiSat-1''' is a [[remote sensing]] [[satellite|Earth observation satellite]] built by the ''[[Emirates Institution for Advanced Science and Technology|Emirates Institution for Advanced Science and Technology (EIAST)]]'' under an agreement with [[Satrec Initiative]], a satellite manufacturing company in [[South Korea]]. The earth observation satellite was designed and developed by ''Satrec Initiative'', with participation from EIAST engineers.&lt;ref name="EIAST2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eiast.ae/download/0500196.pdf | title=DUBAISAT-1: Mission Overview, Development Status and Future Applications | publisher=''Emirates Institution for Advanced Science and Technology'' | accessdate=August 5, 2012 | author=Al Rais, Adnan | pages=V196 - V199 | display-authors=etal | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307160555/http://www.eiast.ae/download/0500196.pdf | archivedate=March 7, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DubaiSat-1''' observes the earth at a [[Low Earth orbit|Low Earth orbit (LEO)]] and generates high-resolution optical images at 2.5m in [[panchromatic]] and at 5m in [[multispectral image|multispectral]] bands. These images provide decision makers in the UAE as well as EIAST clients with a valuable tool for a wide range of applications including [[infrastructure]] development, urban planning, and environment monitoring and protection. DubaiSat-1 images are also useful for promoting [[geosciences]] and remote sensing research in the region, and for supporting different scientific disciplines in private and academic sectors.&lt;ref name="Satreci1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.satreci-us.com/documents/papers/IAC-09.B1.3.10.%20DS-1%20CAMERA%20Pre-launch%20Performance%20Characterization%20(YW%20Choi%20et%20al.).pdf | title=IAC-09.B1.3.10 DUBAISAT-1 Camera: Pre-Launch Performance Characterization | publisher=''Satrec Initiative'' | date=October 2009 | accessdate=August 5, 2012 | author=Choi, Young-Wan | pages=1–5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EIAST3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eiast.ae/default.aspx?options=%7Ba93e7034-0baa-4e2b-be21-721a4b6feb8e%7D&amp;view=Article&amp;layout=Article&amp;itemId=113&amp;id=81 | title=DubaiSat-1 Space Segment | publisher=''Emirates Institution for Advanced Science and Technology'' | accessdate=August 5, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917115232/http://www.eiast.ae/default.aspx?options=%7Ba93e7034-0baa-4e2b-be21-721a4b6feb8e%7D&amp;view=Article&amp;layout=Article&amp;itemId=113&amp;id=81 | archivedate=September 17, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, DubaiSat-1 images have been used, to monitor progress on the [[The World (archipelago)|Dubai World]] Megaproject, [[Palm Islands]], and the [[Al Maktoum International Airport]].&lt;ref name="GN1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/government/dubaisat-1-starts-to-transmit-images-of-the-uae-from-space-1.534426 | title=DubaiSat-1 starts to transmit images of the UAE from space | publisher=''[[Gulf News]]'' | date=August 6, 2009 | accessdate=August 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DC1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dubaichronicle.com/2009/08/10/dubaisat-1-sends-first-series-of-images-from-space/ | title=DubaiSat-1 sends first series of images from space | publisher=''Dubai Chronicle'' | date=August 10, 2009 | accessdate=August 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] also used DubaiSat-1 images to monitor relief efforts following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="UN1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.un-spider.org/about-us/news/en/5025/2011-03-29t103900/dubaisat-1-images-help-un-efforts-japan | title=DubaiSat-1 images help UN efforts in Japan | publisher=''[[UN-SPIDER|UN - SPIDER]]'' | date=March 29, 2011 | accessdate=August 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GulfToday1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gulftoday.ae/portal/1526afe3-d5e0-4ee7-a259-484133eeac71.aspx | title=DubaiSat-1 images help UN efforts in Japan | publisher=''[[The Gulf Today]]'' | date=March 29, 2011 | accessdate=August 5, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126092916/http://gulftoday.ae/portal/1526afe3-d5e0-4ee7-a259-484133eeac71.aspx | archivedate=January 26, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellite accommodates two main payloads. The primary payload is the ''Dubai Medium Aperture Camera (DMAC)'', and the secondary and experimental payload, the ''Space Radiation Monitor (SRM)''.&lt;ref name="EIAST2"/&gt;

The DMAC system is [[Push broom scanner|pushbroom imaging system]] with one panchromatic and four multi-spectral imaging channels. It also consists of an ''Electro-Optical Subsystem'' and the ''Payload Management Subsystem''. The Electro-Optical Subsystem has a [[telescope]], a focal plane assembly, and a Signal Processing Module. The Payload Management Subsystem consists of the ''Thermal &amp; Power Module'' and the ''Mass storage &amp; Control Module''.&lt;ref name="EIAST2"/&gt;

The ''Space Radiation Monitor'', the secondary and experimental payload, is capable of measuring the [[Absorbed dose|total ionizing dose]] from the charged particles at the orbits of satellites. The instrument utilizes four ''[[MOSFET|p-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effects Transistors (MOSFETs)]]''. These devices measure the current-voltage characteristics of the satellite. Subsequent analysis will allow measurements of the amount of cumulative ionizing dose, and of the total ionizing dose of the devices.&lt;ref name="EIAST2"/&gt;

==Structure==
DubaiSat-1 has a hexagonal body with three deployable solar panels. The frame includes spacecraft adaptors, six [[longerons]], [[wikt:Special:Search/rail|rails]], an inner ring that provides rigidity and stability of the satellite's camera, inner rods and three decks. Three spacecraft adaptors connect with shear brackets and mechanically couple the satellite and separation adaptor of the launch vehicle, the Dnepr Rocket. Each one of the spacecraft adaptors has separation sensors to monitor the separation condition between the satellite and the launch vehicle. The umbilical connector attaches on the lower surface of the bottom deck with its mounting support bracket.&lt;ref name="EIAST2"/&gt;

==Ground Station Components==
[[File:Ground Station Components.jpg|175px|thumbnail|right|The ground station components of DubaiSat-1.]]
EIAST's Ground Station is located in Dubai, and is the only ground system supporting the DubaiSat-1 mission. The ground system consists of three main subsystems:

===The Antenna and RF Subsystem===
The ''Antenna and RF subsystem'' consists of an 11.28 meter [[Antenna (radio)|antenna system]], an S-band [[transmitter]] feed, an S-band receiver feed, an X-band receiver feed, and a [[tracking system]]. The RF equipment, including transmitting and receiving antennas, are used to communicate with the satellite. The Antenna &amp; RF subsystem receives X-band RF signals and performs RF processing. It also produces a demodulated and bit-synchronized data stream from X-band signals. In general, the main functions of the antenna &amp; RF subsystem are to transmit imaging orders and command the satellite through the S-band transmitter feed; receive information and health status from the satellite through the S-band receiver feed; and download the images through the X-band feed.&lt;ref name="EIAST2"/&gt;

===The Mission Control Station===
From the Mission Control Station, EIAST staff plan and operate the entire [[space mission]], including the configuration and scheduling of resources for both space and ground elements. It also monitors and commands the satellite.&lt;ref name="EIAST2"/&gt;

===Image Receiving and Processing Station===
The third component of the ground system is the ''Image Receiving and Processing Station (IRPS)''. The IRPS receives and processes the X-band downlink data in real-time. This includes generation of standard image products and catalogues for integration with system management; for archive management; and for comprehensive user interface to provide easy access to satellite image data.&lt;ref name="EIAST2"/&gt;

The IRPS is located at EIAST’s ground station in Dubai, UAE. It has a direct interface with the main mission control station and it generates schedule requests which includes imaging and download schedules. It also archives image and ancillary data for product generation and distribution.&lt;ref name="EIAST2"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Infrastructure development===
Satellite imagery provides an alternative way of looking at the world. It can add significant incremental data useful in a wide range of applications. The high-resolution spatial images can complement the existing [[Ground Sampling Distance|geographic information system]] databases too.

DubaiSat-1 images support infrastructure development in the UAE and the [[Persian Gulf]] region.  These images assist decision makers involved in [[urban planning|urban and rural planning]], [[transportation]], [[utilities]] and [[Surveying|mapping]]. Some images were also useful for monitoring progress on the [[The World (archipelago)|Dubai World Megaproject]], [[Palm Islands]] and the [[Al Maktoum International Airport]].&lt;ref name="GN1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DC1"/&gt;

===Environmental===
Many environmental and meteorological events such as vegetation stress, [[fog]], [[land degradation]], [[sandstorms]], [[desertification]] and [[droughts]] cannot be captured by ground measurements alone, making remote sensing an important tool in environmental monitoring. The sun-synchronous orbit of DubaiSat-1 merges with data from geostationary missions to provide enhancements on existing models.

Additionally, due to their low precipitation rates, arid regions are the world’s major source of atmospheric dust that affects local, regional and [[global climate]]. Dust and sand storms create potentially hazardous [[air quality]] for humans, and adversely affect climate on regional and worldwide scales. Remote sensing is a demonstrably valuable tool for detecting, [[Surveying|mapping]] and [[weather forecast|forecasting]] such events. However [[arid]] and [[semi arid]] regions have their own specific and unique characteristics and vulnerabilities that require special attention when adapting existing remote sensing tools efficiently. Satellite imaging helps monitor and improve management of the world’s agricultural resources.  Multispectral images contribute by monitoring land use, generating vegetation indices, and monitorong [[water quality]].&lt;ref name="UAEI1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/docs/DubaiSat-1_transmits_images_from_Mirny_Mine_in_Russia/46871.htm | title=DubaiSat-1 Transmit images from Mirny Mine in Russia | publisher=''UAE Interact'' | date=September 29, 2011 | accessdate=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disaster relief===
Satellite images are useful tools to assist [[emergency management|disaster relief teams]] to determine how to tackle rescue and recovery efforts in the wake of catastrophic natural, or even man-made, events. In the aftermath of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|tsunami in Japan on March 11, 2011]], EIAST applied DubaiSat-1 to help [[disaster relief]] teams determine and manage the scale of the event.&lt;ref name="UN1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GulfToday1"/&gt;

==Future plans==
DubaiSat-2 is an electro-optical earth observation satellite system to be launched and operated by Emirates Institution for Advanced Science and Technology. The spacecraft will have a [[Ground Sampling Distance|ground sampling distance]] of 1 meter at 600&amp;nbsp;km in a sun-synchronous orbit.  DubaiSat-2 will have the capacity to store approximately 17,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of image data. It is relatively small, weighing less than 300&amp;nbsp;kg and suitable for commercial use within the UAE or other regions worldwide. The electro-optical payload is a push-broom camera with TDI sensors.&lt;ref name="Nat2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/dubaisat-2-to-be-an-improvement-on-predecessor | title=DubaiSat-2 to be an improvement on predecessor | publisher=''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'' | date=May 26, 2011 | accessdate=August 8, 2012 | author=Conroy, Erin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nat3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/technology/dubaisat-2-imaging-satellite-ready-for-blast-off | title=DubaiSat-2 to be an improvement on predecessor | publisher=''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'' | date=February 17, 2011  | accessdate=August 8, 2012 | author=Conroy, Erin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Launch was scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2012 and is ready, but launch practicalities will move it into 2013. DubaiSat-2 also includes an experimental propulsion system for orbit correction and maintenance. The satellite’s expected lifetime is at least five years. The modules in the satellite use two CAN Bus networks to communicate with each other without the use of a host computer.&lt;ref name="Nat3"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7594">The '''Dura-Europos Route map''' - also known as ''stages map'' - is the fragment of a speciality map from [[Late Antiquity]] discovered 1923 in [[Dura-Europos]]. The map had been drawn onto the leather covering of a shield by a [[Roman legion|Roman soldier]] of the [[Cohors XX Palmyrenorum]] between AD 230 and AD 235. The fragment is considered the oldest map of (a part of) Europe preserved in the original.

==Discovery==
The [[Belgium|Belgian]] archaeologist [[Franz Cumont]] discovered the map fragment during [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] in Dura Europos in 1923&lt;ref&gt;Cumont 1925, p. 1f.&lt;/ref&gt; in the submerged “Tower of the Archers”.&lt;ref&gt;according to Cumont Tower 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The map is a fragment of leather or parchment, painted in colour, which had been found among the remnants of wooden oval shields. It was identified by Cumont as the remains of the leather cover of a laminated shield with remnants of the wooden parts of the shield still attached to the back. The map had been made by a Roman soldier, probably an infantrymen or an archer of the Cohors XX Palmyrenorum stationed in Dura. This soldier drew the travel stages of his unit on the march through the [[Crimean]] on the leather cover of his shield somewhere between AD 230 and AD 235. Geographical inconsistencies may point towards the owner of the shield having commissioned somebody else with the drawing.

==Description==
The preserved fragment of the map is 0,45 by 0,18 m. Cumont assumed that the map originally had had a width of 0,65 m.&lt;ref&gt;Cumont 1925, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction is divided by a semi-circular white line into two parts. This roughly drawn line represents the coastline of the western and northern coast of the [[Black Sea]]. To the left side of the coast, the open sea is represented in blue colour, with three ships on the fragment preserved. To the right of the coastline, the land is shown in reddish colour. Twelve places of the Black Sea region are named on the map, with the Latin names being used, but transcribed into Greek. To the right of each place name, distances were noted in [[Roman mile]]s, comparable to the [[Itinerarium Antonini]]. The places themselves have been depicted symbolically, with the draughtsman using the same symbol  - a building with a gabled roof - for all places.
It is very likely that the places mentioned are stages of a march of the Cohors XX Palmyrenorum. Two blue lines under the names Ἰστρος, ποτ(αμός) and Δάνουβις ποτ(αμός) suggest rivers which were crossed during the march.

==Reconstruction of the stages==

The list of stages of the preserved part of the map after Cumont&lt;ref&gt;Cumont 1925, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; is as follows:
::Παν[υσος ποτ(αμός)? μί(λια) . .]
::[[Varna|Οδεσ[σός]] μί(λια) . .]
::[[Kavarna|Βυβόνα]] [μί(λια) . .]
::[[Mangalia|Καλ[λ]ατις]] μί(λια) . .
::[[Constanța|Τομέα]] μί(λια) λγ´
::[[Histria (ancient city)|Ἰστρος ποτ(αμός)]] μί(λια) μ´
::Δάνουβις ποτ(αμός) [μί(λια) . .]
::[[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Τύρα]] μί(λια) πδ´
::Βορ[υ]σ[θέν]ης [μί(λια) . .]
::[[Chersonesos Taurica|Χερ[σ]όν[[ησος]] . . . . ]
::[[Chatyr-Dag|Τραπ[εζοῦς]] . . . . .]]&lt;ref&gt;Contrary to Cumont and following Uhden 1932, p. 118, this is equated with the mountain Chatyr-Dag.&lt;/ref&gt;
::[[Feodosiya|Aρτα[ξάτα]] μί(λια) . .]

The first part of the route corresponds to the route between [[Byzantium]] and the mouth of the [[Danube]] known from the Itinerarium Antonini and the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]]. Some of the cities are also mentioned in the [[Ravenna Cosmography]]. Following the map of Dura-Europos, the Danube is crossed after modern Histria and then advances into regions in which the Itinerarium Antonini and the Tabula Peutingeriana do not record any Roman roads.

==Cartographic Characteristics==
The fragment shows that the route map was oriented to the west. This is indicated by the direction of the writing and the arrangement of the décor. In addition to that, the westernmost point of the map, the river [[Panysus]], is on the upper edge of the map, while the easternmost point, the place [[Feodosiya|Ardabda]], is on the lower edge. This orientation to the west is unique in Roman cartography, as all other known maps were oriented to the east, towards the sunrise.&lt;ref&gt;Uhden 1932, p. 121f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
The dating of the map fragment can be narrowed to the first half of the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;Nabbefeld 2008, p. 39f.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cohors XX Palmyrenorum is confirmed to have been in Dura-Europos in AD 230 by a dedication to the Roman Emperor [[Alexander Severus]], which gives us a starting date. After the Roman defeat in the [[battle of Edessa]] in AD 260, the Roman presence was all but forced out of the Black Sea region. One city named in the map, Histria, already had fallen to the Goths in AD 238, after severe riots in the region following the death of Alexander Severus in March of AD 235. A military march through this region after AD 235 or 238 at the latest seems unlikely. These facts give us a time frame for the creation of the route map of five years between AD 230 and 235.

==Perception, importance and whereabouts==
After its discovery by Cumont, the route map was soon forgotten again. In his 2004 publication of the weapons and military equipment of Dura-Europos, James mentions the map, but doubts that the fragment was part of a Roman shield.&lt;ref&gt;Simon James: ''The Arms and Armour and Other Military Equipment.'' Excavations at Dura-Europos 1928-1937, Volume 7. British Museum, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Only Nabbefeld took the map up again in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Nabbefeld 2008, Catalog No. 712.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its importance for the history of ancient cartography, the map is also important for [[military history]], as it is evidence that Roman military units were present in southern Russia until the [[Goths|Gothic]] invasion after AD 260 and that the city of Artaxata (today Feodossija) must still have been under Roman control at that time.
The map is the only road map of antiquity preserved in the original.&lt;ref&gt;Nabbefeld 2008, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The map is preserved at the manuscript collection of the French National Library.&lt;ref&gt;Archive number GR 1354(2) V.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plain stretches from the Pyrenees mountains and the French coast of the [[Bay of Biscay]] in the west to the Russian [[Ural Mountains]] in the east.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/196332/European-Plain|title=European Plain|date=10 January 2010|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its shores are washed to the west and northwest by waters of the Atlantic basin, to the northeast - the Arctic basin, and to the southeast - the Mediterranean basin. To the south of the Middle European Plain stretch the central uplands and plateaus of Europe elevating to the peaks of the [[Alps]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. To the northwest across the [[English Channel]] lie the [[British Isles]], while across several straits north of the [[Jutland Peninsula]] lies the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] which is part of the [[Fennoscandia]] ecoregion.

Most of the plain lies in the [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]] [[biome]], while its far eastern portion extends into [[steppe]] of the ecoregion [[Eurasian Steppe]].

Beside the Great European Plain there is number of other European plains such as the [[Pannonian Basin]] or Mid-Danube Plain which lies in the land of Alpine-Carpathian mountains, [[Po Valley|Padana Plain]] which is located in the valley of the [[Po (river)|Po]] river, and lowlands of the [[British Isles]].

The Great European Plain is divided into the [[North European Plain]] (Middle European Plain) and the [[East European Plain]]. The subdivision is a historical one, rather than [[geomorphological]]: the Russian portion of [[East European Plain]] is also known as the Russian Plain which covers almost entirely the European portion of the [[Russian Federation]] ([[European Russia]]).

In Western Europe, the plain is relatively narrow (mostly within {{convert|200|miles|disp=or}} in width) in the northern part of Europe, but it broadens significantly toward its eastern part in Western Russia.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

==Hydrology==
The plains are cut by many important rivers like the [[Loire]], [[Rhine]] and [[Vistula]] in the west; the [[Northern Dvina]] and [[Daugava River|Daugava]] flowing northwards in East Europe and Russia and the [[Volga]], the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and the [[Dnieper]] flowing southwards of the [[European Russia]].

* [[English Channel]]
* [[North Sea]]
* [[Baltic Sea]]
* [[Gulf of Bothnia]]
* [[White Sea]]
* [[Black Sea]]
* [[Sea of Azov]]
* [[Caspian Sea]]


== Bio-system ==
The European plain was once largely covered by forest, before human settlement and the resulting [[deforestation]] that occurred. One of the last (and largest) remnants of this primeval forest is [[Białowieża Forest]], which straddles the border between [[Belarus]] and [[Poland]]. Now the European Plain is the most agriculturally productive region of Europe.

The '''flag of the Faroe Islands''' is an offset cross, representing [[Christianity]]. It is similar in design to other [[Nordic Cross|Nordic flags]] – a tradition set by the ''[[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]]'' of Denmark,&lt;ref name="Andrew Evans"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_GfdBAASUQC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=iceland+flag+christianity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3YNGTbOfNML98AaumrzkDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=iceland%20flag%20christianity&amp;f=false|author=Andrew Evans|title=Iceland|publisher=Bradt|quote=Legend states that a red cloth with the white cross simply fell from the sky in the middle of the 13th-century Battle of Valdemar, after which the Danes were victorious.

The flag is called '''''Merkið''''', which means "the banner" or "the mark". It resembles the flags of neighbouring [[Flag of Norway|Norway]] and [[Flag of Iceland|Iceland]].

==Description and symbolism==
The design of the flag incorporates a red [[Nordic cross]], which is offset to the left. The red cross is [[Fimbriation|fimbriated]] [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]] and is set on a white field. The flag design closely resembles that of the [[Flag of Norway|Norwegian flag]], with the fimbriated cross. The flag proportion is usually 5:7.

White symbolises the creators of the flag, the foam of the sea and the pure, radiant sky of the Faroe Islands, while the old Faroese blue and red colours are reminiscent of other Scandinavian and Nordic flags; representing the Faroe Islands' bonds with other Nordic countries.&lt;ref name=SN&gt;Smith/Neubecker: Wappen und Flaggen aller Nationen. München 1981; {{ISBN|3-87045-183-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The modern Faroese flag was devised in 1919 by [[Jens Oliver Lisberg]] and others while they were studying in [[Copenhagen]]. The first time Merkið was raised in the Faroe Islands was on 22 June that year in [[Fámjin]] on the occasion of a wedding. On 25 April, 1940, the [[British occupation of the Faroe Islands in World War II|British occupation government]] approved the flag for use by Faroese vessels, during the tenure of [[Carl Aage Hilbert]] as Danish prefect. Britain did not want the same flag as German-occupied Denmark to be used. April 25 is still celebrated as '''Flaggdagur''' and it is a national holiday. With the Home Rule Act of 23 March, 1948, the flag was recognized by the [[Denmark|Danish Government]] as the national flag of the Faroes. The original flag is displayed in the church of [[Fámjin]] in [[Suðuroy]].

'''Fort McCoy''' is an [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] in [[Marion County, Florida]], United States. It is situated northeast of [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]] and lies between the towns of [[Sparr, Florida|Sparr]] and Eureka on County Road 316 and is directly north of [[Silver Springs, Florida|Silver Springs]] on County Road 315. The community is part of the Ocala [[Ocala, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==Geography==
Fort McCoy is located at {{coord|29|21|52|N|81|57|59|W|}}.&lt;ref name="GR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community is located west of the [[Ocala National Forest]].

==History==
Fort McCoy was originally named Fort Mackay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tK5PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mwYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6903%2C7420165 | title=County's history reflected in its names | work=Ocala Star-Banner | date=May 14, 1987 | accessdate=30 May 2015 | author=Pyle, Nancy | pages=8A}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacKay and MacCoy were both settlers in the area who were killed by Indians during the war. The town of Fort McCoy is named after the settler Jeb MacCoy but spelled differently. When hostilities with Native Americans worsened, Jeb MacCoy was killed by Indians while bringing his family into Fort Russell. Captain Mackay was head of the local militia, and was killed while surveying Itonia Scrub on March 20, 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southernhistory.us/Counties/c4mari.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116045442/http://www.southernhistory.us/Counties/c4mari.htm |archivedate=2012-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
The first school in Fort McCoy was supposedly a log cabin that was built near the fort; and it is thought to have been abandoned during the [[Second Seminole War]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated201"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 
  | page = 201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Union Church was built near the Fort McCoy Cemetery, it was used as the school, with church services on the weekends.&lt;ref name="autogenerated201"/&gt; Sometime between the 1890s and the first decade of the 1900s, a wooden building was built to serve as the school. In 1935, this building was destroyed in a fire. A small new school (to serve the approximate 75 pupils at the time) was built on the land donated by Dr Percy F. Lisk, which was right in front of the old schools location. The new brick school opened in 1936. The earliest known student grade levels are from the 1940s, when the school was known as Fort McCoy High School.

Fort McCoy High School was closed in 1963 and re-opened soon after as Fort McCoy Elementary School. The population of Fort McCoy increased over the years, and by the 1980s the property was a vast land full of "portable classrooms". Due to the population increase and age of the building (50 years old), the Marion County School Board decided to have a new school built in 1986. The original brick building became the Fort McCoy Public Library in 1996, after a $60,000 renovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marioncountyfl.org/library/Branch_FtMcCoy.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517065324/http://www.marioncountyfl.org/Library/Branch_FtMcCoy.aspx |archivedate=2013-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, the new campus opened, renamed as [[Fort McCoy School]], which now served elementary and middle school students (Pre-K to Eighth grade). That campus is still being used today, as well as the same grade levels being served.

Most kids from kindergarten through eighth grade attend [[Fort McCoy School]]. Most high school students in Fort McCoy attend [[North Marion High School (Florida)|North Marion High School]], while some attend [[Lake Weir High School]].

The [[geography]] of [[Australia]] encompasses a wide variety of [[biogeography|biogeographic]] regions being the world's smallest [[Australia (continent)|continent]] but the sixth-largest country in the world. The population of Australia is concentrated along the eastern and southeastern coasts. The geography of the country is extremely diverse, ranging from the snow-capped [[mountains]] of the [[Australian Alps]] and [[Tasmania]] to large [[deserts]], tropical and temperate forests.

[[File:Australia on the globe (Antarctic claims hatched) (Oceania centered).svg|left|thumb|Australia on the globe (+Antarctic claims hatched)]]
Australia is a [[country]], a [[continent]] and an [[island]]. It is located in [[Oceania]] between the [[Indian Ocean]] and the South [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|sixth largest country]] in the world with a total area of {{convert|7,686,850|km2}} (including [[Lord Howe Island]] and [[Macquarie Island]]), making it slightly smaller than the 48 states of the [[contiguous United States]] and 31.5 times larger than the [[United Kingdom]].

The Australian mainland has a total coastline length of {{convert|35877|km|mi|abbr=on}} with an additional {{convert|23859|km|mi|abbr=on}} of island coastlines.&lt;ref name="gsa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/national-location-information/dimensions/border-lengths#heading-1|title=Border Lengths – States and Territories|accessdate=18 August 2016|date=2004|work=[[Geoscience Australia]]|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 758 estuaries around the country with most located in the tropical and sub-tropical zones.&lt;ref name="mbs"&gt;{{cite book|title=Moreton Bay Study: A Scientific Basis for the Healthy Waterways Campaign|last=Dennison|first=William C.|author2=Eva G.

This exclusive economic zone does not include the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]] (an additional 5,896 square kilometres).  

Australia has the largest area of ocean jurisdiction of any country on earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/mbp/publications/general/nat-atlas-nonfish.html Non-Fisheries Uses in Australia's Marine Jurisdiction] National Marine Atlas. [[Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts]]&lt;/ref&gt; It has no land borders. The northernmost points of the country are the [[Cape York Peninsula]] of [[Queensland]] and the [[Top End]] of the [[Northern Territory]].
The western half of Australia consists of the [[Western Plateau]], which rises to mountain heights near the west coast and falls to lower elevations near the continental centre. The Western Plateau region is generally flat, though broken by various mountain ranges such as the [[Hamersley Range]], the [[MacDonnell Ranges]], and the Musgrave Range. Surface water is generally lacking in the Western Plateau, although there are several larger rivers in the west and north, such as the [[Murchison River (Western Australia)|Murchison]], [[Ashburton River (Western Australia)|Ashburton]], and [[Victoria River, Northern Territory|Victoria]] river. 

The [[Great Dividing Range|Eastern Highlands]], or Great Dividing Range, lie near the [[East Coast of Australia|eastern coast of Australia]], separating the relatively narrow eastern coastal plain from the rest of the continent. These [[Eastern Australian temperate forests]] have the greatest relief, the most rainfall, the most abundant and varied flora and fauna, and the densest human settlement.

Between the Eastern Highlands and the Western Plateau, lie the Central Lowlands, which are made up of the Great Artesian Basin and Australia's largest river systems, [[Murray-Darling Basin]] and [[Lake Eyre Basin]].

Off the eastern coast of Australia is the world's largest coral reef complex, the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. The State of [[Tasmania]], a large and mountainous island, resides in the south-eastern corner of Australia.

Australia is the lowest, flattest, and oldest continental landmass on Earth&lt;ref&gt;Pain, C.F., Villans, B.J., Roach, I.C., Worrall, L. &amp; Wilford, J.R. (2012): Old, flat and red – Australia's distinctive landscape. In: ''Shaping a Nation: A Geology of Australia.'' Blewitt, R.S. (Ed.) Geoscience Australia and ANU E Press, Canberra. Pp. 227–275 {{ISBN|978-1-922103-43-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has had a relatively stable geological history. Geological forces such as [[tectonic uplift]] of mountain ranges or clashes between tectonic plates occurred mainly in Australia's early history, when it was still a part of [[Gondwana]]. Its highest peak is [[Mount Kosciuszko]] at {{convert|2228|m|ft}}, which is relatively low in comparison to the highest mountains on other continents. 

[[Charles Rowland Twidale]] estimates that between 10 and 20% of Australia's modern landscapes formed during the [[Mesozoic]] when the continent was part of Gondwana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rowland |first1=C.R. |author-link=Charles Rowland Twidale |date=1994 |title=Gondwanan (Late Jurassic and Cretaceous) palaeosurfaces of the Australian craton |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0031018294901392 |journal=[[Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology]] |volume=112 |issue=1–2 |pages=157–186 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia is situated in the middle of the tectonic plate, and therefore currently has no active volcanism.  Minor earthquakes which produce no damage occur regularly, while major earthquakes measuring greater than magnitude 6 occur on average every five years.&lt;ref name="ag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/land-of-earthquakes-and-volcanoes.htm |title=Land of earthquakes and volcanoes? |author=Kevin Mccue |accessdate=25 April 2010 |date=26 February 2010 |publisher=[[Australian Geographic]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306150520/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/land-of-earthquakes-and-volcanoes.htm |archivedate=6 March 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The terrain is mostly low [[plateau]] with deserts, rangelands and a fertile plain in the southeast. Tasmania and the [[Australian Alps]] do not contain any permanent [[icefields]] or [[glaciers]], although they may have existed in the past.

===Hydrology===
[[File:Reliefmap of Australia.png|thumb|left|Relief map showing major rivers and lakes]]

Because much of Australia's interior is arid, the low average annual rainfall means interior rivers are often dry and lakes empty. The headwaters of some waterways are located in tropical regions where summer rains create a high rate of [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]]. Flood events drastically alter the dry environment in which the ecology of central Australia has had to adapt to the [[boom and bust]] cycle.

The [[Great Artesian Basin]] is an important source of water, the world's largest and deepest fresh water [[Drainage basin|basin]]. Access to water from the basin has led to the expansion of grazing into areas that were previously far too dry for livestock. Towns and cities across the country sometimes face major water storage and usage crises in which restrictions and other measures are implemented to reduce water [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Water restrictions are based on a gradient of activities that become progressively banned as the situation worsens.

[[Billabong]] is the Australian name given to the [[oxbow lake]]s that can form along a meandering river's course. In a worldwide comparison of height, Australia's [[waterfall]]s are relatively insignificant, with the longest drop ranked 135th according to the World Waterfall Database.&lt;ref name="geowat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ga.gov.au/education/geoscience-basics/landforms/tallest-waterfalls.jsp |title=Significant Waterfalls |author= |accessdate=11 June 2010 |work=[[Geoscience Australia]] |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525195932/http://www.ga.gov.au/education/geoscience-basics/landforms/tallest-waterfalls.jsp |archivedate=25 May 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political geography==
{{Main|States and territories of Australia}}
{{Australia states imagemap|200px}}

Australia consists of six states, two major mainland territories, and other minor territories. The states are [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[Western Australia]]. The two major mainland territories are the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Western Australia is the largest state covering just under one third of the Australian landmass, followed by Queensland, South Australia, and New South Wales.

Australia also has several minor territories; the federal government administers a separate area within New South Wales, the [[Jervis Bay Territory]], as a naval base and sea port for the national capital. In addition Australia has the following inhabited, external territories: [[Norfolk Island]], [[Christmas Island]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], and several largely uninhabited external territories: [[Ashmore and Cartier Islands]], [[Coral Sea Islands]], and [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]].  Australia also claims a portion of [[Antarctica]] as the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]], although this [[Territorial claims in Antarctica|claim]] is not widely recognized.

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of Australia}}

[[File:Australia map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|left|Climate map of Australia]]

By far the largest part of Australia is [[arid]] or [[semi-arid]]. A total of 18% of Australia's mainland consists of [[Deserts of Australia|named deserts]],&lt;ref name="geodes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/education/geoscience-basics/landforms/deserts.jsp |title=Deserts |accessdate=11 June 2010 |work=[ |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205171650/http://www.ga.gov.au/education/geoscience-basics/landforms/deserts.jsp |archivedate=5 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while additional areas are considered to have a [[Desert climate#Hot desert climates|desert climate]] based on low rainfall and high temperature. Only the south-east and south-west corners have a temperate climate and moderately fertile soil. The [[Northern Australia|northern part]] of the country has a tropical climate: part is tropical [[rainforest]]s, part grasslands, and part desert.

Rainfall is highly variable, with frequent [[Drought in Australia|drought]]s lasting several seasons thought to be caused in part by the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]]. Occasionally a dust storm will blanket a region or even several states and there are reports of the occasional large [[tornado]]. Rising levels of [[salinity]] and [[desertification]] in some areas is ravaging the landscape.

Australia's tropical/subtropical location and cold waters off the western coast make most of western Australia a hot desert with aridity, a marked feature of the greater part of the continent. These cold waters produce little moisture needed on the mainland. A 2005 study by Australian and American researchers investigated the desertification of the interior, and suggested that one explanation was related to human [[settler]]s who arrived about 50,000 years ago. Regular burning by these settlers could have prevented [[monsoon]]s from reaching interior Australia. The [[outback]] covers 70 percent of the continent.

==Natural hazards==
[[Cyclone]]s along the northern coasts, severe [[Severe storms in Australia|thunderstorm]]s, [[Drought in Australia|drought]]s, occasional [[Floods in Australia|flood]]s, [[heat waves]], and frequent [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfire]]s are natural hazards that are present in Australia.

==Environment==
{{Main|Environmental issues in Australia}}
[[File:Whitehaven Beach, Whitsunday Island, Queensland.jpg|thumb|[[Whitehaven Beach]] in [[Queensland]] in October]]
Current environmental issues include: soil erosion from overgrazing, [[industrial development]], [[urbanization]], and poor farming practices; [[Salinity in Australia|soil salinity]] rising due to the use of poor quality water; desertification (partly as a result of the introduction by European settlers of [[Rabbits]]); [[Invasive species in Australia|introduced pest species]]; clearing for agricultural purposes threatens the natural habitat of many unique animal and plant species; the Great Barrier Reef off the northeast coast, the largest coral reef in the world, is threatened by increased shipping and its popularity as a tourist site; limited natural fresh water resources; threats from [[Invasive species, Australia|invasive species.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5851">The '''geology of Bulgaria''' consists of two major structural features. The Rhodope Massif in southern Bulgaria is made up of [[Archean]], [[Proterozoic]] and [[Cambrian]] rocks and is a sub-province of the Thracian-Anatolian polymettalic province. It has dropped down, faulted basins filled with [[Cenozoic]] sediments and volcanic rocks. The Moesian Platform to the north extends into Romania and has [[Paleozoic]] rocks covered by rocks from the [[Mesozoic]], typically buried by thick Danube River valley [[Quaternary]] sediments. In places, the Moesian Platform has small oil and gas fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|year=1997|title=Encyclopedia of European &amp; Asian Regional Geology|publisher=Springer|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bulgaria]] is a country in southeastern Europe. It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east.

==Geologic History &amp; Stratigraphy==
[[Archean]] rocks outcrop in the south and west of Bulgaria as part of an ultrametamorphosed polymetamorphic complex including low-grade [[migmatite]], gneissoid [[granite]],  and [[anatexite]]. Marble, [[amphibolite]] and [[gneiss]] from the [[Proterozoic]] are found in the Rhodope Massif. 

During the [[Precambrian]], the Variscan Thracian Suture was part of the Balkan-Carpathian ophiolite segment. This feature left behind a highly stratified obducted [[ophiolite]] island arc assemblage with tectonized [[peridotite]], [[dunite]], [[lherzolite]], [[wehrlite]] and [[troctolite]], as well as pillow lava meta-basalt, and sheeted dikes of micro-gabbro and [[dolerite]]. Outcropping in the northwest, these rocks were originally part of the suture north a large landmass and south of the Moesian Platform rocks. 

===Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)===
At the outset of the [[Paleozoic]], [[Cambrian]] age politic sediments formed together with volcanic rocks such as [[keratophyre]], [[spilite]], and pyroclastic flows, associated with [[tholeiitic]] island arc volcanism. [[Ordovician]], [[Silurian]] and [[Middle Devonian]] [[shale]] and [[lydite]] (a form of siliceous [[argillite]] rich in [[graptolite]] fossils) outcrops in the west. 

The [[Caledonian orogeny]] affected the region in the Middle Devonian through the [[Carboniferous]]. Carbonates deposited, along with a basin filled with [[turbidites]] between two landmasses. Lakes were common during the late Paleozoic, depositing [[anthracite]] coal now found north of Varna and Sofia. [[Permian]] rocks reflect terrestrial sedimentation and dry land conditions and contain some coal as well as thick [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] layers. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=105-106}}

===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
In the [[Triassic]], the lithospheric plates of the Moesian Platform in the north and the Rhodope Massif in the south continued to interact. At the beginning of the [[Mesozoic]], red sandstones were depositing in terrestrial conditions, but as time passed the region became submerged during a [[marine transgression]], kicking off carbonate deposition. During the [[Ladinian]], the central part of the basin reached greater depths below water and experienced anoxic conditions, leading to the formation of organic-rich black shale. The late Triassic brought a marine regression, reducing water levels and returning to platform carbonate formation and then by the [[Norian]] carbonate [[breccia]] formed as dry land conditions prevailed. In the northwest, there are some signs of volcanism from the time, including continental rift trachyandesite and [[andesite]]-basalt eruptions. 

In the east, particularly within the East Balkan Range, are [[olistolith]] remnants as an [[allochthon]] of Triassic rocks in [[Middle Jurassic]] black shales. Triassic rocks include turbidite sandstone and sub-reefal limestone. In Srednogorie, they form a sizeable [[nappe]] with [[phyllite]], amphibolite, calcareous schist and turbidites as well as marble. 

During the [[Jurassic]], a marine transgression began, flooding the entire region by the [[Callovian]]. Early Jurassic rocks include basal sandstone and limestone, rich in [[ammonite]], bivalve and brachiopod fossils. A deepwater basin, likely branched off the [[Paleotethys Ocean]] was discovered in the East Balkan Range. It was bordered to the south by a turbidite basin with red marl and limestone. 

The center of the basin witnessed black shale deposition in the Middle Jurassic while the edges deposited biomicritic limestone. The northwest and northeast formed platform limestones, separated by a "groove" of pelagic [[micrite]] and nodular limestone. 
This sedimentation pattern continued into the [[Cretaceous]], until the [[Barremian]] when reef limestones and marl began to build up. An orogeny began in Austria at the end of the [[Albian]], reducing sea levels and confining marine environments to the northwest. By the late Cretaceous, epicontinental limestones were depositing on the Moesian Platform in the north. An island arc developed in the south, while the South Carpathians trough appeared in the northwest, filling with turbidite and marl. Intensive igneous activity began due to subduction in the area of Srednogorie. Deepwater sedimentation with pelagic limestone and turbidites, together with volcanic rocks such as tholeiitic, calc-alkaline or shoshonite rocks mark the late Cretaceous. In fact, rocks near Srednogorie often contain copper ores. The events of the late Cretaceous were the first signs globally of the formation of the  Alpine-Himalayan mountain belt. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=108-107}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7643">[[File:Central African Rifts.svg|thumb|right|300px|thumb|Rift basins of southern and eastern Sudan]]
The '''geology of [[Sudan]]''' formed primarily in the [[Precambrian]], as igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rock. Ancient terranes and inliers were intruded with [[granites]], [[granitoids]] as well as volcanic rocks. Units of all types were deformed, reactivated, intruded and metamorphosed during the [[Proterozoic]] [[Pan-African orogeny]]. Dramatic sheet flow erosion prevented almost any sedimentary rocks from forming during the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]]. From the Mesozoic into the [[Cenozoic]] the formation of the Red Sea depression and complex faulting led to massive sediment deposition in some locations and regional volcanism. Sudan has petroleum, [[chromite]], salt, gold, limestone and other natural resources. 

==Stratigraphy, tectonics &amp; geologic history==
The oldest rocks in Sudan are igneous and metamorphic [[inlier]] areas formed in the [[Precambrian]] and reactivated by the [[Pan-African orogeny]]. Examples include the Nuba mountains, Darfur block and the rocks beneath the Nubian and Bayuda deserts. In the two deserts, metasedimentary rocks were intruded by [[granitoids]] and turned to [[migmatite]] during the Pan-African orogeny. The Red Sea Hills preserve [[gneiss]], metamorphosed to [[amphibolite]] grade in the sequence of [[metamorphic facies]] and metasediments together with [[ophiolite]] assemblages. Fragments of the [[East Saharan Craton]] form exotic [[terranes]] near Haya, southwest of [[Port Sudan]] in the Red Sea Hills. These rock units include [[quartzite]] and [[marble]] formed between 800 and 900 million years ago as a passive continental margin. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=218-219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoproterozoic: Pan-African Orogeny===
Geologists have interpreted the metasedimentary belts between the [[East Sahara Craton]] and the [[Red Sea fold and thrust belt]] as a rifting zone, related to the formation of an ocean in the [[Neoproterozoic]]. 

The Jebel Rahib Belt, situated in the northwest, contains deformed basic and ultrabasic igneous rocks and thick layers of carbonaceous metasediments, formed at the time of the Pan-African orogeny. This time constraint for deformation and low-grade metamorphism comes from granitoids formed after the orogeny, dated to 570 million years ago. Dense, [[mafic]] oceanic crust formed in the Jebel Rahib rift as evidenced by an ophiolite assemblage that includes ultramafic rocks, [[pyroxenite]], [[gabbro]], [[chert]] and [[pillow lava]]. Pan-African age rocks may have formed in the [[Nubian Shield]] outside the Red Sea fold and thrust belt. 

The [[North Kordofan Belt]] is very similar to the [[Jebel Rahib rift]] and likely formed around the same time, although it lacks ophiolites. The belt contains [[tourmaline]]-bearing granites and granitoids, dated to 590 million years ago. Shear zones formed at the end of the orogeny were sealed with [[mica]] [[pegmatite]] by 560 million years ago. Similarly, intrusive granitoids in the Darfur Belt formed between 590 and 570 million years ago. 

The low-grade volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the [[Nuba Mountains]] also include dismembered, remnant ophiolites, basic and acid [[plutons]], metamorphosed 700 million years ago and affected by igneous activity 550 million years ago, after the orogeny ended. The eastern Nuba Mountains is younger Pan-African age crust, likely a [[klippe]] or a small ocean basin. 

A strip of [[tonalite]], [[granodiorite]] and peralkaline granites, formed from low-grade metasediments, metavolcanics and granitoids at the time of the Pan-African orogeny occur along the eastern bank of the Nile River. These rocks were intruded by granitoids twice, once 898 and again 678 million years ago. Between the Nile and Red Sea Hills, another area of metasedimentary rocks outcrops, including marbles intercalated with metaquartzite. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=218}}

===Paleozoic-Mesozoic (541-66 million years ago)===
Sudan experienced extensive [[pediplanation]], a form of sheet flow erosion that scours away  overlying sediments, leaving a gently inclined bedrock surface. Because of this, the country has hardly any unmetamorphosed rocks from the [[Paleozoic]] or early [[Mesozoic]], with the exception of a few 530 million year old [[Early Cambrian]] rocks at Sabaloka. 

Structural geologists believe that the Red Sea depression is not bounded by faults. Rather, it formed beginning in the [[Carboniferous]] as a subsidence zone and continued to develop in the Mesozoic as a depression between [[monocline]] flexures approximately marking the present African and Arabian coasts of the sea. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=220}}

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
Rift-related faulting in the [[Oligocene]] through the [[Miocene]] in the Sudan monocline zone led to the deposition of 4.3 kilometers of sediment in the vicinity of what is now the Suakin Archipelago, filling the trough. By the [[Miocene]], the region was an area of shallow lagoons, in which [[evaporites]] deposited. 

A renewed period of intense faulting in the [[Pliocene]] and early [[Pleistocene]] formed a central trough and led to basic and ultrabasic volcanic dikes intruding the Red Sea area. The region stabilized by the Pleistocene, after the connection with the Mediterranean closed in the Pliocene. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=220}}

==Hydrogeology==
The 60 to 80 meter thick Quaternary [[Gezira Formation|Gezira]], [[Atshan Formation|Atshan]] and [[Gash Formation]]s are unconfined and unconsolidated aquifers, composed of alluvial sand, silt, clay and gravel with high quality water. The Gezira and Atshan aquifers are recharged by water leakage from the Blue and White Nile, while the Gezira is recharged from the Gezira River. The Um Ruwaba Formation, by contrast is also unconsolidated and sometimes several hundred meters thick, but recharges very slowly from rainwater, limiting its use to domestic production and livestock watering. 

Fractured and weathered zones with Gedaref basalts and Jebel Mara volcanic rocks fresh groundwater close to the surface and brine deeper in the aquifers. Paleozoic sedimentary rocks in western Sudan and Red Sea littoral sediments exhibit a mix of intergranular and fracture flow. The Nubian Sandstone Aquifer and [[Gedaref Sandstone]] have significant intergranular flow and storage and range between 40 and 400 meters thick. Water from these formation is typically fresh, although high salinity affects some water at greater depths. A similar fresh to brackish range is seen in the five to 20 meter thick weathered zone—and fractures—associated with Precambrian basement rock. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Hydrogeology of Sudan|publisher=British Geological Survey|url=http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Hydrogeology_of_Sudan#Hydrogeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resource geology==
Sudan has extensive natural resources, even after the independence of [[South Sudan]] in 2011 reduced the oil reserves within its borders. Natural gas is found offshore of [[Port Sudan]] in the [[Red Sea]] and many mineral reserves are situated in the eastern highlands. Sudan has [[chromite]], gold, [[gypsum]], limestone and salt, although the combined production of chromite, salt and gold accounts for only one percent of the value of exports. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=220}}

'''ISO 3166-2:CZ''' is the entry for [[Czech Republic|Czechia]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for two levels of subdivisions within the country:
* [[regions of the Czech Republic|13 regions and 1 capital city]]
* [[districts of the Czech Republic|76 districts]]

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|CZ}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code for the country. The second part is either of the following:
* two digits: regions
* three characters (two digits followed by a digit or a letter): districts

For the districts, the first two digits indicate the region that the district is in (based on the original [[NUTS of the Czech Republic#NUTS codes|NUTS code of the region]]):
* 10 and 11: [[Prague]]
* 20: [[Central Bohemian Region]]
* 31: [[South Bohemian Region]]
* 32: [[Plzeň Region]]
* 41: [[Karlovy Vary Region]]
* 42: [[Ústí nad Labem Region]]
* 51: [[Liberec Region]]
* 52: [[Hradec Králové Region]]
* 53: [[Pardubice Region]]
* 63: [[Vysočina Region]]
* 64: [[South Moravian Region]]
* 71: [[Olomouc Region]]
* 72: [[Zlín Region]]
* 80: [[Moravian-Silesian Region]]

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

Subdivision names are sorted in [[Czech alphabet]]ical order: a (á), b, c, č, d (ď), e (é) (ě), f, g, h, ch, i (í), j, k, l, m, n (ň), o (ó), p, q, r, ř, s, š, t (ť), u (ú) (ů), v, w, x, y (ý), z, ž.

'''''Indira Bai''''' is an Indian novel in [[Kannada language]] written by Gulavadi Venkata Rao (1844–1913). Published in 1899, it is considered the first modern novel in Kannada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indira Bai|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2000/07/02/stories/1302067m.htm|website=The Hindu|accessdate=26 April 2017|date=2 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; It dealt with the hitherto ostracized practice of [[Remarriage#Remarriage following widowhood|widow remarriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter-III Novels of Triveni|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/96203/8/08_chapter%203.pdf|publisher=shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[social novel]] set in present-day [[Kanara|coastal Karnataka]], and allegedly based on real incidents, it portrays a society in transition. Supporting widow remarriage, it denounces social evils like [[corruption]] in the bureaucracy and the reactionary attitude of established religious institutions, and takes a critical view of the contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=George|first1=K.

'''John Speed''' (1551 or 1552 – 28 July 1629) was an English [[Cartography|cartographer]] and historian.&lt;ref name=mapforum&gt;{{cite web|last=Baynton-Williams|first=Ashley|title=John Speed|url=http://www.mapforum.com/02/speed.htm|publisher=MapForum.Com|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hibernian"&gt;"Life of John Speed," ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jLMRAAAAYAAJ The Hibernian Magazine, Or, Compendium of Entertaining Knowledge]'', July 1782, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johan Speed, Nigel Nicolson (introduction), ''The Counties of Britain: A Tudor Atlas'', Thames &amp; Hudson (1989): {{ISBN|0-500-25104-5}}; Pavilion Books (1992): {{ISBN|1-85145-131-5}} (pbk, 1995): {{ISBN|1-85793-612-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the best known English mapmaker of the [[Stuart period]].&lt;ref name=potter&gt;{{cite web|title=Maps by John Speed |url=http://www.jpmaps.co.uk/maps/speed |publisher=Jonathan Potter Limited |accessdate=17 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303082240/http://www.jpmaps.co.uk/maps/speed |archivedate= 3 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Intriguing History, "[http://www.intriguing-history.com/john-speed-maps-online/ John Speed Maps Online]," 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Major-General [[William Roy]], co-founder of the [[Ordnance Survey]] and earlier [[Christopher Saxton]] also contend for the most famous status.  The word cartography refers to the 'drawing of the charts of maps' and derives from the French ''carte'', card or chart, and Greek graphia, writing.  Although it is a useful term&amp;nbsp;... it is important to note that the word was only coined around 1859 and therefore was not used by the [[Ordnance Survey]]'s earliest writers and readers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=Rachel|title=Map of a Nation|year=2010|publisher=Granta Publications|location=London|isbn=978-1-84708-254-1|pages=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Speed was born at [[Farndon, Cheshire]] and went into the tailoring business of his father, Samuel, later in life.&lt;ref name=speedmaps&gt;{{cite web|title=The Life of John Speed|url=http://www.johnspeedmaps.co.uk/aboutjs.htm|publisher=JohnSpeedMaps.co.uk|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Anne Taylor, "[https://specialcollections.blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=13179 A Theatre of Treasures]," [[Cambridge University Library]] Special Collections, October 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Neobard Palmer, "The Town of Holt, In County Denbeigh," ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HftJAAAAYAAJ Archaeologia Cambrensis: The Journal of the Cambrian Archoeological Association]'' (London: Cambrian Archoeological Association, April 1907), 425.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William West, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lIxJAAAAMAAJ ''The history, topography and directory of Warwickshire''] (Birmingham, UK, R. Wrightson, 1830), 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FamilySearch"&gt;"England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975," database, [https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:NLGF-VYL FamilySearch], 6 December 2014), John Speed, 19 Aug 1629; citing , reference ; FHL microfilm 380,199, 380,200.&lt;/ref&gt;

While working in London, Speed was a tailor and member of a corresponding guild, and came to the attention of "learned"  individuals.&lt;ref name="Goffart"&gt;Walter Goffart, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qex4Pl0YATwC Historical Atlases: The First Three Hundred Years, 1570-1870]'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003),54.&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals included  Sir [[Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke|Fulke Greville]], who subsequently made him an allowance to enable him to devote his whole attention to research. By 1598 he had enough patronage to leave his manual labor job and "engage in full-time scholarship."&lt;ref name="Goffart" /&gt; As a reward for his earlier efforts, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] granted Speed the use of a room in the Custom House. Speed, was, by this point, as "tailor turned scholar" who had a highly developed "pictorial sense."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Goffart, "The First Venture into 'Medieval Cartography'," Alfred the Wise: Studies in Honour of [[Janet Bately]] on the Occasion of Her Sixty-Fifth Birthday, ed. Jane Annette Roberts, Janet Laughland Nelson, and Malcolm Godden (Woodbridge, UK: D.S. Brewer, 1997), 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1575, Speed married a woman named Susanna Draper in [[London]], later having children with her. These children definitely included a son named John Speed, later a "learned" man with a [[doctorate]], and an unknown number of others, since chroniclers and historians cannot agree on how many children they raised.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hibernian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=AFtIAAAAYAAJ Miscellanea Genealogica Et Heraldica]'', ed. Joseph Jackson Howard, Vol. II (London: Mitchell and Hughes, 1898), p. 18-25. While this genealogy says he was born in 1542 and has other dates that conflict with existing records, it does his list names of his children: Samuel Speed (later married to a woman named Joan, had a child also named Samuel Speed who died in 1633), Nathan Speed, Joan Speed (later married to John Hayley), Sarah Speed (later married to Edward Black), Anne Speed (later married to Benjamin Wesley), and later Dr. John Speed (later married to a woman named Margaret, had one child named Samuel Speed, died in 1640) Taylor says that Speed and Susanna had 18 children, while Hibernian Magazine says they had 12 sons and six daughters, with a total of 21 children, neither of which can be independently confirmed, making it seem that they only had 6 or 7 children. Susanna was also reportedly the daughter of Thomas Draper.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rev. E. Kell, "On the Castle and Other Ancient Remains at Southampton," ''The Journal  of the British Archaeological Association'', Vol. XXI (London: British Archaeological Association, 1865), p. 289-290.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gough, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WzHeAgAAQBAJ Anecdotes of British Topography: Or, an Historical Account of What Has Been Done For Illustrating The Topographical Antiquities of Great Britain and Ireland]'' (London: W. Richardson and S. Clark, 1768, reprinted in 2014), 184, 448.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, there is no doubt that the Speed family was relatively well-off.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, "The Town of Holt,"  421, 425, 429.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1595, Speed published a map of biblical [[Canaan]], in 1598 he presented his maps to Queen Elizabeth, and in 1611-1612 he published maps of Great Britain, with his son perhaps assisting Speed in surveys of English towns.&lt;ref name="Dainty"&gt;[http://www.shakespearesengland.co.uk/2010/08/04/the-maps-of-john-speed/ The Maps of John Speed], Shakespeare's England, August 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=k20WAgAAQBAJ The King James Version at 400: Assessing Its Genius as Bible Translation and Its Literary Influence]'', ed.

Werth, ''The Fabulous Dark Cloister: Romance in England after the Reformation'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2011), 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 77 or 78, in August 1629, Speed died.&lt;ref name="FamilySearch" /&gt; He was buried alongside his wife in London's [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]] church on [[Fore Street, London|Fore Street]] within the [[Barbican Estate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage|url=http://www.stgilescripplegate.org.uk/heritage/heritage.htm|publisher=St Giles' without Cripplegate|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EncylLon&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Christopher Hibbert|Hibbert, Christopher]]; Ben Weinreb; [[John Keay]]; Julia Keay.|title=The London Encyclopaedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xa0D0PqiwfEC&amp;pg=PA762|year=2010|location=London|publisher=Pan Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-73878-2|pages=762}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; Later on, a memorial to John Speed was also erected behind the altar of the church.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; According to the church's website, "[His was] one of the few memorials [in the church] that survived the bombing"  of London during [[The Blitz]] of 1940–1941&amp;nbsp;... The website also notes that "[t]he cast for the niche in which the bust is placed was provided by the Merchant Taylors' Company, of which John Speed was a member."  His memorial brass has ended up on display in the [[Burrell Collection]] near [[Glasgow]].

==Works==
Speed drew historical maps in 1601 and 1627 depicting the invasion of England and Ireland, depictions of the English [[middle ages]], along with those depicting the current time, with rough originals but appealing, colorful final versions of his maps.&lt;ref&gt;Goffart, ''Historical Atlases'', xi, 38, 54, 80-81, 83, 105, 112, 123, 201, 203, 443, 471.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gough, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WzHeAgAAQBAJ Anecdotes of British Topography]'', 595, 608.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was with the encouragement of [[William Camden]] that Speed began his ''Historie of Great Britaine'', which was published in 1611.&lt;ref name=SpeedDNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Speed, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/maps/digital-maps/john-speed-proof-maps John Speed proof maps], [[Cambridge University]], Accessed April 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he probably had access to historical sources that are now lost to us (he certainly used the work of [[Christopher Saxton|Saxton]] and [[John Norden|Norden]]), his work as a historian is now considered secondary in importance to his map-making, of which his most important contribution is probably his [[town planning|town plans]], many of which provide the first visual record of the British towns they depict.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Nicolson, "Introduction" within John Speed, ''Britain's Tudor Maps: County by County'' (London: British Library, reprint, 2016, originally published in 1988), p. 7-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In years leading up to this point, while his atlas was being compiled, he sent letters to [[Robert Cotton (died 1559)|Robert Cotton]], part of the British government to ask for assistance in gathering necessary materials.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Ellis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PBRnAAAAMAAJ ''Original Letters of Eminent Literary Men''] (London: Camden Society, 1843), 104, 108-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A New And Accvrat Map Of The World.png|thumb|right|In 1627 George Humble published the Prospect of the Most Famous Parts of the World, printed by John Dawson. This is the world map from this atlas with John Speed's name in the title, but not attributed to Speed's authorship.&lt;ref name=SpeedBio&gt;{{cite journal|title=Biography John Speed II|journal=MapForum.com|year=2006|volume= 3|url=http://www.mapforum.com/03/speepros.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

His atlas ''The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine'' was published in 1611 and 1612, and contained the first set of individual county maps of [[England]] and [[Wales]] besides maps of [[Ireland]] and a general map of [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Speed, ''Britain's Tudor Maps'', p. 9-10, 13, 15-16. Nicolson's introduction goes from pages 7 to 15. Speed took a number of existing maps as his models, crediting five of the maps to [[Christopher Saxton]], five to [[John Horden]], two to [[William Smith (MP for Aylesbury)|William Smith]], one to Philip Symonson and others to [[John Harington, 1st Baron Harington of Exton|John Harington]], [[William White (MP)|William White]], [[Thomas Durham]], James Burrell, and [[Geradus Mercator]]. For these maps, his engraver was a Flemish man by the name of Jodocus Hondius, major engraver at the time, his printers were William Hall and John Beale, and his map-sellers were John Sudbury and George Humble.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, "[https://specialcollections.blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=9784 Speed maps now in the Cambridge Digital Library]," [[Cambridge University Library]] Special Collections, March 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gough, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WzHeAgAAQBAJ Anecdotes of British Topography]'', 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Tacked onto these maps was an introduction at the beginning when he addressed his "well affected and favourable reader," which had numerous Christian and religious undertones, admitting that there may be errors, but he made it the best he could, and stated his purpose for the atlas:&lt;ref&gt;West, "Speed's Address to His Readers," [https://books.google.com/books?id=lIxJAAAAMAAJ ''The history, topography and directory of Warwickshire''], 38-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

With maps as "proof impressions" and printed from [[copper]] plates, detail was engraved in reverse with writing having to be put on the map the correct way, while speed "copied, adapted and compiled the work of others," not doing much of the survey work on his own, which he acknowledged.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew McRae, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PZdzKiq5JkgC ''God Speed the Plough: The Representation of Agrarian England, 1500-1660''] (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2002, reprint), xi, 231-232, 238.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Canny, "The Origins of Empire: An Introduction," The Oxford History of the British Empire series, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ug3vygR4GWIC The Origins of Empire: British Overseas Enterprise to the Close of the Seventeenth Century]'', Vol. I, ed. Nicholas Canny (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005, reprint), 1. Speed was the one to use the phrase "the Empire of Great Britaine" which differed from another phrase used, by Thomas Blennerhasset, at the time: "great Brittaines imperial crowne."&lt;/ref&gt; The atlas was not above projections of his political opinions" Speed represented King [[James I]] as one who unified the "Kingdoms of the British isles."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjIJJ5oHOAcC British Identities and English Renaissance Literature]'', ed. David J. Baker and Willy Maley (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2002), ix, 135, 138, 141, 150, 162, 248.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[British Library]] published a book, introduced by former MP [[Nigel Nicolson]] and accompanied by commentaries by late medieval and early modern historian Alasdair Hawkyard, which reprinted this collection of maps on the British Isles, showing that Speed had drawn maps of areas ranging from [[Bedfordshire]] to [[Norfolk]] and [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Speed, ''Britain's Tudor Maps'', p. 6-152. Speed's maps were of areas including the British Isles, [[England]], the [[Saxon]] Heptarchy, [[Berkshire]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[Cheshire]], [[Cornwall]], [[Cumberland]], [[Derbyshire]], [[Devonshire]], [[Dorset]], [[Durham, England|Durham]], [[Essex]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[Hampshire]], [[Isle of Wight]], [[Herefordshire]], [[Hertfordshire]], Huntingtonshire, [[Kent]], [[Lancashire]], [[Leicestershire]], [[Lincolnshire]], [[Middlesex]], [[Monmouthshire]], [[Northamptonshire]], [[Northumberland]], [[Oxfordshire]], [[Rutland]], [[Shropshire]], [[Somerset]], [[Staffordshire]], [[Suffolk]], [[Surrey]], [[Sussex]], [[Warwickshire]], [[Westmorland|Westmoreland]], [[Wiltshire]], [[Worcestershire]], [[Yorkshire]] (different parts), [[Holy Island, Anglesey|Holy Island]], the [[Farne Islands]], the [[Channel Islands]], [[Isle of Man]], [[Wales]], [[Anglesey]], [[Breconshire]], [[Caernarfonshire]], [[Cardiganshire]], [[Carmarthenshire]], [[Denbighshire]], [[Flintshire]], [[Glamorganshire]], [[Merionethshire]], [[Montgomeryshire]], [[Pembrokeshire]], [[Radnorshire]], [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[Connaught]], [[Leinster]], [[Munster]], and [[Ulster]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Most, but not all, of the county maps have town plans on them; those showing a ''Scale of Passes'' being the places he had mapped himself. In 1627, two years before his death, Speed published ''Prospect of the Most Famous Parts of the World'' which was the first world atlas produced by an Englishman, costing 40 [[shillings]], meaning that its circulation was limited to "richer customers and libraries," where many survive to this day.&lt;ref name="Nicolson"&gt;Nigel Nicolson, "Introduction" within Speed, ''Britain's Tudor Maps'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marion Wynne-Davies, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MJAdBQAAQBAJ Sidney to Milton, 1580-1660]'' (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003), 138-141, 171, 179-180, 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a fascinating text describing the areas shown on the back of the maps in English, although a rare edition of 1616 of the British maps has a Latin text – this is believed to have been produced for the Continental market. Much of the engraving was done in [[Amsterdam]] at the workshop of a Flemish man named [[Jodocus Hondius]], with whom he collaborated with from 1598 until 1612, with Hondius's sudden death, a time period of 14 years.&lt;ref name="Nicolson" /&gt; His maps of English and Welsh counties, often bordered with costumed figures ranging from [[nobility]] to country folk, are often found framed in homes throughout the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Speed, ''Britain's Tudor Maps'', p. 18-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1611, he also published ''The genealogies recorded in the Sacred Scriptures according to euery family and tribe with the line of Our Sauior Jesus Christ obserued from Adam to the Blessed Virgin Mary'', a biblical genealogy, reprinted several times during the 17th century. He also drew maps of the [[Channel Islands]], [[Poland]], and [[the Americas]], the latter published only a few years before his death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Library of Congress]], [https://www.loc.gov/item/76690846/ America with those known parts in that unknowne worlde both people and manner of buildings], 1626.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Library of Congress]] catalog, [https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/search?searchArg1=76693574&amp;argType1=phrase&amp;searchCode1=K010&amp;searchType=2&amp;combine2=and&amp;searchArg2=&amp;argType2=all&amp;searchCode2=GKEY&amp;combine3=and&amp;searchArg3=&amp;argType3=all&amp;searchCode3=GKEY&amp;location=all&amp;place=all&amp;type=all&amp;language=all&amp;recCount=10 The ilands], London.

Described as a "Protestant historian, "Puritan historian," or "Protestant propagandist" by some, Speed wrote about [[William Shakespeare]], whom he called a "Superlative Monster" because of certain plays, Roman conquest, history of [[Chester]], and explored "earlymodern concepts of national identity."{{clarify|date=June 2018|reason=What is meant by the text after certain plays?}}&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Jack Heller, [Penitent Brothellers: Grace, Sexuality, and Genre in Thomas Middleton's City Comedies](https://books.google.com/books?id=osKRuBKU344C) (Newark: University of Delaware Press, 2000), 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UQFFL3nP9OwC ''Boudica: Historical Commentaries, Poetry, and Plays''], ed.

As these writings indicate, he possibly saw Wales as English and not an [[Welsh independence|independent entity]]. More concretely, there is evidence that Speed, in his chronicling of history, uses "theatrical metaphors" and his developed "historiographic skill" to work while he repeats myths from medieval times as part of his story.&lt;ref&gt;Igor Djordjevic, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eKO1CwAAQBAJ ''King John (Mis)Remembered: The Dunmow Chronicle, the Lord Admiral's Men, and the Formation of Cultural Memory''] (New York: Routledge, 2016), 43, 61, 86, 117, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Since his maps were used in many high circles, Speed's legacy has been long-reaching. After his death, in 1673 and 1676, some of his other maps on the British isles, the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region, specifically of [[Virginia]] and [[Maryland]], the [[East Indies]], the [[Russian Empire]] then ruled by [[Peter the Great]], [[Jamaica]], and [[Barbados]], among other locations.{{clarify|date=June 2018|reason=What about these maps?

In later years, Speed would be called "our English Mercator," a person of "extraordinary industry and attainments in the study of antiques," an "honest and impartial historian," a "faithful Chronologer," and "our Cheshire historian...a scholar...a distinguished writer on history."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Park, "Edward, Long Montague," ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=asNLAAAAcAAJ A Catalogue of the Royal and Noble Authors of England, Scotland, and Ireland]'', Vol. 3 (London: John Scott, 1806), 265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_xQIAAAAQAAJ A new and general biographical dictionary]'', Vol. 10 (London: Printed for multiple individuals, 1762), 454-455.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hyde Cassan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wEMufpOuzrgC ''The Lives of the Bishops of Winchester from Birmius''], Vol. 1 (London, C. and J.

Even today, prints of his "beautiful maps" can be found in living rooms across the world, and sell for hundreds of thousands of pounds in rare art and map auctions, drawing in map collectors across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Morris, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/19/john-speed-atlas-maps-auction John Speed's atlas could take auctioneer into uncharted territory], ''[[The Guardian]]'', July 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some use John Speed's maps, and connected commentary, to interpret William Shakespeare's plays, especially since Speed did not like Shakespeare in the slightest, calling him a "papist" &lt;ref name=Shakespeare /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Velma Bourgeois Richmond, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u6HTCgAAQBAJ ''Shakespeare, Catholicism, and Romance''] (New York: Bloombury Publishing, 2015), 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham Holderness, [https://books.google.com/books?id=P592DQAAQBAJ ''The Faith of William Shakespeare''] (UK: British Library, 2016), 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (New York: Infobase Publishing, 2009), 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Berat]] and [[Gjirokastër]] are inscribed as rare examples of an architectural character of the [[Ottoman period]]. Berat bears witness to the coexistence of various religious and cultural communities down the centuries. It features a castle, most of which was built in the 13th century, although its origins date back to the 4th century BC. The [[citadel]] area hosts many [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] churches, mainly from the 13th century, as well as several mosques built in the 15th century. Gjirokastër features a series of two-storey houses which were developed in the 17th century. The town also retains a [[bazaar]], an 18th-century [[mosque]], and two churches of the same period.&lt;ref name="Historic Centres of Berat and Gjirokastër"/&gt;

| The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] amphitheatre of [[Durrës]] was the largest in the [[Balkans]]. The amphitheatre has an elliptical shape with the longest axis of {{convert|136|m|ft}} and it was {{convert|20|m|ft}} high. It had a capacity of up to 20 000 spectators. After the 4th century AD, the amphiteatre ceased to serve its purpose and was gradually abandoned. Systematic excavations on the site started in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=L'amphithéâtre de Durres|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/910/ |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre | language=French|accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| The [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tombs are located near the town of [[Pogradec]] near the village of [[Selcë e Poshtme]]. Most tombs were created in the 3rd century BC and were carved into the rock. Initially built for  Illyrian kings, some of the tombs were later reused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Les tombes de la Basse Selca|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/909/ |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre | language=French|accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| The area around the town of Pogradec at the shores of [[Lake Ohrid]] was inhabited by the [[Illyrians]] in the 5th century BC, followed by the Romans and the Slavs. Traces of the Roman road [[Via Egnatia]] are evidence of an important passage route in the region. The ruins of the paleo-christian church of [[Lin, Korçë|Lin]] together with its floor mosaics reveal the presence of Christianity. The historical centre of Pogradec represents an example of 19th to 20th century Albanian vernacular architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5626/ |title=Natural and Cultural Heritage of the Ohrid Region |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=8 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| The city of Apollonia was likely founded in the 6th century BC by [[Greek colonisation|Greek colonists]] from [[Corfu]] and [[Corinth]]. The city flourished in the 4th century BC and was an important trade and economic center, one of the most eminent cities of the [[Adriatic]] basin. During Roman times, it was one of the gateways to Via Egnatia. Throughout its existence, the culture and the general development of the city maintained a clear Greek character while keeping a close relationship with the Illyrian hinterland. The city was abandoned during the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=The Ancient City of Apollonia|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5885/ |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre | language=English|accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6503">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in Guam'''. There are 10 mammal species in [[Guam]], of which 0 are critically endangered, 2 are endangered, 0 are vulnerable, and 0 are near-threatened. 1 of the species listed for Guam is considered to be extinct.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]]:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| {{IUCN status|EX}} ||'''Extinct'''|| No reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.
|-
| {{IUCN status|EW}} ||'''Extinct in the wild'''|| Known only to survive in captivity or as a naturalized populations well outside its previous range.
|-
| {{IUCN status|CR}} ||'''Critically endangered'''|| The species is in imminent risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| {{IUCN status|EN}} ||'''Endangered'''|| The species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| {{IUCN status|VU}} ||'''Vulnerable'''|| The species is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| {{IUCN status|NT}} ||'''Near threatened'''|| The species does not meet any of the criteria that would categorise it as risking extinction but it is likely to do so in the future.
|-
| {{IUCN status|LC}} ||'''Least concern'''|| There are no current identifiable risks to the species.
|-
| {{IUCN status|DD}} ||'''Data deficient'''|| There is inadequate information to make an assessment of the risks to this species.

The [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'s Shallow Radar gave a strong reflection from the top and base of LDAs, meaning that pure water ice made up the bulk of the formation (between the two reflections).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planetary.brown.edu/pdfs/3733.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This is evidence that the LDAs in [[Hellas Planitia]] are [[glacier]]s covered with a thin layer of rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Head, J. et al.  2005.

Radar Sounding Evidence for Ice within Lobate Debris Aprons near Hellas Basin, Mid-Southern Latitudes of Mars.  Lunar and Planetary Science XXXIX.  2441.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, radar studies in  Deuteronilus Mensae show that all lobate debris aprons examined in that region contain ice.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, E., et al.  2018. ALL OUR APRONS ARE ICY: NO EVIDENCE FOR DEBRIS-RICH “LOBATE DEBRIS APRONS” IN DEUTERONILUS MENSAE 49th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 2018 (LPI Contrib. No. 2083).  2354.&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiments of the [[Phoenix lander]] and the studies of the [[Mars Odyssey]] from orbit show that frozen water exists just under the surface of Mars in the far north and south (high latitudes).  Most of the ice was deposited as snow when the climate was different.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine, J. et al.  2007.  Exploring the northern mid-latitude glaciation with a general circulation model.  In:  Seventh International Conference on Mars.  Abstract 3096.&lt;/ref&gt;  The discovery of water ice in LDAs demonstrates that water is found at even lower latitudes.  Future [[colonization of Mars|colonists on Mars]] will be able to tap into these ice deposits, instead of having to travel to much higher latitudes.  Another major advantage of LDAs over other sources of Martian water is that they can easily be detected and mapped from orbit.  Lobate debris aprons are shown below from the Phlegra Montes which are at a latitude of 38.2 degrees north.  The Phoenix lander set down at about 68 degrees north latitude, so the discovery of water ice in LDAs greatly expands the range of water easily available on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/phoenix |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822221353/http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/phoenix/ |archivedate=2011-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is far easier to land a spaceship near the equator of Mars, so the closer water is available to the equator the better it will be for colonists.

== Lineated floor deposits ==

The floors of some channels show ridges and grooves that seem to flow around obstacles; these features are called lineated floor deposits or [[lineated valley fill]] (LVF).  Like lobate debris aprons, they are believed to be ice-rich.  Some glaciers on the Earth show such features.

It has been suggested that lineated floor deposits began as LDAs.&lt;ref&gt;Sourness, C., B. Hubbard, R. Milliken, D. Quincey.  2012.  An inventory and population-scale analysis of martian glacier-like forms.  Icarus 217, 243-255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Souness, C. and B. Hubbard.   2013.  An alternative interpretation of late Amazonian ice flow:  Protonilus Mensae, Mars.  Icarus 225, 495-505.&lt;/ref&gt; By tracing the paths of the curved ridges characteristic of LDAs, researchers have come to believe that they straighten out to form the ridges of LVF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Head, J.  |author2=D.

[[Reull Vallis]], pictured below, displays these deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themis.asu.edu/zoom-20021022a |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617191548/http://themis.asu.edu/zoom-20021022a |archivedate=2010-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes the lineated floor deposits show a chevron pattern which is further evidence of movement.  The picture below taken with HiRISE of Reull Vallis shows these patterns.

'''''The Matthew''''' is a replica of a [[caravel]]&lt;ref&gt;Also spelled '''''Mathew''''' at the time.&lt;/ref&gt; sailed by [[John Cabot]] in 1497 from [[Bristol]] to North America, presumably [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland.]] After a voyage which had got no further than [[Iceland]], Cabot left again with only one vessel, the ''Matthew'', a small ship (50 tons), but fast and able. The crew consisted of only 18 men. ''The Matthew'' departed either 2 May or 20 May 1497. He sailed to [[Dursey Island|Dursey Head]] ([[latitude]] 51°36N), Ireland, from where he sailed due west, expecting to reach Asia. However, landfall was reached in North America on 24 June 1497. His precise landing place is a matter of much controversy, with [[Cape Bonavista]] or [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] the most likely sites.

Cabot went ashore to take possession of the land, and explored the coast for some time, probably departing on 20 July. On the homeward voyage his sailors incorrectly thought they were going too far north, so Cabot sailed a more southerly course, reaching [[Brittany]] instead of England. On 6 August he arrived back in [[Bristol]].

==History==
Lack of clear documentation has been a problem in studying the history of ''Matthew''. Even its name has been questioned, with some authors suggesting that it was actually named ''Mattea'' after Cabot's wife.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Ian ''John Cabot and the Matthew'' Breakwater Books 2001 {{ISBN|978-1-55081-131-5}} p.22 [https://books.google.com/books?id=_lvr4WKU2YkC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=cabot+ship+matthew+name+wife&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IKQkVfXfpT&amp;sig=2zS50KHg-Z7hjK_tME0C50mMmYQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SMD-SaSlB-HOjAeli-GeAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5]&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1950s, all that was known about its size is that it was a small ship carrying about 18 men, but the discovery of a letter from a Bristol merchant named John Day written in 1497 saying that "in his voyage he had only one ship of fifty 'toneles' and twenty men and food for seven or eight months" provided more certainty about its size.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;[http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/CXXI/492/778 'Jones, Evan "The ''Matthew'' of Bristol and the financiers of John Cabot’s 1497 Voyage to North America" ''English Historical Review'' Vol. CXXI No. 492 (2006)']&lt;/ref&gt; The age of the ship is also uncertain. The name ''Matthew'' does not appear in the 1492/3 customs accounts, so it was either fairly new or an older ship renamed or a foreign ship. It has been suggested that it probably was an ordinary Bristol merchant ship hired for the occasion. The name ''Matthew'' appears in documents in 1503/04 and 1510/11 but in a 1513 survey there is reference to a 'new Matthew' and references to this ship afterward leave out the 'new' suggesting that Cabot's ''Matthew'' no longer existed.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;

== Replica ==

[[File:The Matthew Dec09 side view.jpg|thumb|''Matthew'' replica moored in Bristol]]

To celebrate the 500th anniversary of Cabot's voyage, a replica of ''Matthew'' was built in Bristol by Storms'l Services, a precursor of the [[Bristol Classic Boat Company]]. The design was by naval architect Colin Mudie. She was dedicated in a ceremony during the first [[International Festival of the Sea, 1996|International Festival of the Sea]], held in Bristol's [[Bristol Harbour|Floating Harbour]] in 1996. The next year, she reconstructed Cabot's original journey on the 500th anniversary of the landmark voyage. On 24 June 1997 the replica of ''Matthew'' was welcomed into port at Bonavista by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]].

{{nofootnotes|date=September 2010}}

A '''party wall''' (occasionally '''parti-wall''' or '''parting wall''', also known as '''common wall''') is a dividing partition between two adjoining buildings that is shared by the occupants of each residence or business. Typically, the builder lays the wall along a [[boundary (real estate)|property line]] dividing two [[terraced house]]s, so that one half of the wall's thickness lies on each side. This type of wall is usually structural. Party walls can also be formed by two abutting walls built at different times. The term can be also used to describe a division between separate units within a multi-unit apartment complex. Very often the wall in this case is non-structural but designed to meet established criteria for sound and/or fire protection, i.e. a [[firewall (construction)|firewall]].

==England and Wales==
While party walls are effectively in common ownership of two or more immediately adjacent owners, there are various possibilities for legal ownership: the wall may belong to both tenants (in common), to one tenant or the other, or partly to one, partly to the other. In cases where the ownership is not shared, both parties have ''use'' of the wall, if not ownership. Other party structures can exist, such as floors dividing flats or apartments.

Apart from special [[statutory]] definitions, the term "Party Wall" may be used in four different legal senses.  
:It may mean:
# a wall of which the adjoining owners are [[leasehold estate|tenants]] in common; 
# a wall divided longitudinally into two strips, one belonging to each of the neighbouring [[owner]]s; 
# a wall which belongs entirely to one of the adjoining owners, but is subject to an [[easement]] or right in the other to have it maintained as a dividing wall between the two [[tenement]]s; 
# a wall divided longitudinally into two [[Moiety title|moieties]], each moiety being subject to a cross easement, in favour of the owner of the other moiety.

In English law the party wall does not confirm a boundary at its median point and there are instances where the legal boundary between adjoining lands actually comes at one face or the other of a wall or part of it, and sometimes at some odd measurement within the thickness of the wall. The legal position is, however, clear insofar as a party using or benefiting from a party wall or structure abutting, on or in its land has rights to use the wall and for it to be retained should the other side no longer wish it to be there. For this reason, expert surveyors are used in the main to issue notices, deal with the response from someone receiving a notice and settling any dispute by an Award. Details can be obtained from the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]].

Originating in London as early as the 11th century, requirements for terraced houses to have a dividing wall substantially capable of acting as a fire break have been applied in some form or other. Evidently, this was not enough to prevent the several great fires of London, and the most famous of which being the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] of 1666.

In [[England]] and [[Wales]], the [[Party Wall etc. Act 1996]], confers rights on those whose property adjoins a party wall or other 'party structure' irrespective of ownership of the wall or structure.

==Paris== 

The principles of the party wall in Paris under the common law in 1765  are the following: 

# If a man when building his home does not leave a sufficient space on his property he can not prevent his wall becoming a party wall with his neighbor who could build his home erect to the wall paying half the cost for materials and land that the wall resides on.
# Nothing can be done to the party wall without legal consent of both neighboring parties. 
# Repairs to the wall are split equally between the two neighboring parties. 
# No beams (of a home) can be placed in the walls by either party more than a one-half inch the thickness of the wall. If a party does wish to install beams into the wall greater than one-half inch thickness of the wall then materials such as jams, or chains must also be added in order to support the beams.

==United States==
In the USA, the term may refer to a fire wall that separates and is used in common by two adjoining buildings (condominium, row house), or the wall between two adjacent commercial buildings that were often built using common walls, or built walls onto existing walls. Rights and obligations are governed by state statutes, and common law.

The wall starts at the foundation and continues up to a [[parapet]], creating two separate and structurally independent buildings on either side.

'''Primary immigration''' is a term which describes the movement of the earner of a [[family]], or a young unattached [[Single (relationship)|single]] [[man]], from one [[country]] to another, usually to improve their economic condition. Once the primary immigrant is established in the new country, they will often send for their family to come and join them (perhaps many years later), according to [[family reunification]] immigration laws. This is known as ''secondary immigration''. Most countries tend to restrict the categories of people allowed to be primary immigrants, but allow the reunification of families of people already legally resident.

'''Richard G. Smith''' is a British geographer. His research focuses on the philosophy of [[Jean Baudrillard]], and [[urban studies]], especially on poststructuralist cities.

==Academic career==
Smith was educated at the [[University of Hull]] (BA Hons Geography, 1st class, 1992) and [[University of Bristol]] (PhD, 1995 - supervised by Sir Nigel Thrift). Currently he works at [[Swansea University]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dr Richard Smith|url = http://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/science/geography/r.g.smith/|website = www.swansea.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Smith speaks about cities around the world, recently in Kazan in Russia, and in Bogotá and Medellín in Colombia. He was interviewed about global cities for Colombian TV. His research papers are among the most highly cited in the world. His current research focuses on poststructuralism, assemblage theory, and actor-network theory in urban studies.

He is the author of numerous articles on [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]]'s oeuvre. Editor of ''The Baudrillard Dictionary'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2010), ''Jean Baudrillard: Fatal Theories'' (Routledge, 2009), 'Baudrillard Redux' (Special Issue of ''Cultural Politics'', 2011), ''Jean Baudrillard: from Hyperreality to Disappearance: Uncollected Interviews'' (EUP, 2015). He is an editorial board member of the ''International Journal of Baudrillard Studies''. He organized the first major UK conference on Baudrillard's work in 2006 (4-6 September), and was interviewed in 2014 about Baudrillard for a South Korean TV documentary.

'''Savoy''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|v|ɔɪ}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/savoy?q=savoy | title = Savoy on www.oxforddictionaries.com. | accessdate = 2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-frp|Savouè}} {{IPA-frp|saˈvwɛ|}}; {{lang-fr|Savoie}} {{IPA-fr|savwa|}}; {{lang-it|Savoia}} {{IPA-it|saˈvɔːja|}}; {{lang-pms|Savòja}} {{IPA-pms|saˈvɔja|}}; {{Lang-de|Savoyen}} {{IPA-de|zaˈvɔʏ̯ən|}}) is a cultural region in [[Central Europe]]. It comprises roughly the territory of the [[Western Alps]] between [[Lake Geneva]] in the north and [[Dauphiné]] in the south.

The historical land of Savoy emerged as the feudal territory of the [[House of Savoy]] during the 11th to 14th centuries. The historical territory is shared among the modern countries of [[France]], [[Italy]], and [[Switzerland]].

Installed by [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]], officially in 1003, the House of Savoy became the longest surviving royal house in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;The Romance of the House of Savoy; (Vol.1)Weil, Alethea.Putnam, New York (1898)openlibrary.org/books/ol23330616m, Intro.pg.1&lt;/ref&gt; It ruled the [[County of Savoy]] to 1416 and then the [[Duchy of Savoy]] from 1416 to 1860.

The territory of Savoy was annexed to France in 1792 under the [[French First Republic]], before being returned to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] in 1815. Savoy, along with the [[county of Nice]], was finally annexed to France by a [[plebiscite]], under the [[Second French Empire]] in 1860, as part of a political agreement ([[Treaty of Turin (1860)|Treaty of Turin]]) brokered between the French emperor [[Napoleon III]] and King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] that began the final steps in the process of [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]]. Victor Emmanuel's dynasty, the House of Savoy, retained its Italian lands of [[Piedmont]] and [[Liguria]] and became the [[Kings of Italy|ruling dynasty of Italy]].

==Geography==
[[File:Les Saisies.jpg|thumb|right|Alpine landscape of [[Les Saisies]], as seen from [[Mont Bisanne]].]]

In modern France, Savoy is part of the [[Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes]] region. Following its annexation to France in 1860, the territory of Savoy was divided administratively into two separate [[Departments of France|departments]], [[Savoie]] and [[Haute-Savoie]].

The traditional capital remains [[Chambéry]] ([[Ciamberì]]), on the rivers [[Leysse]] and [[Albane]], hosting the [[castle]] of the House of Savoy and the Savoyard [[senate]]. The state included six districts:
* Savoie Propre, sometimes known as Ducal Savoy (capital Chambéry)
* [[Chablais]] (capital [[Thonon-les-Bains]])
* [[Faucigny]] (capital [[Bonneville, Haute-Savoie|Bonneville]])
* [[Moûtiers|Tarentaise]] (capital [[Moûtiers, Savoie|Moûtiers]])
* [[Maurienne]] (capital [[Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne]])
* [[Genevois (province)|Genevois]] (capital [[Annecy]])

The County and Duchy of Savoy incorporated [[Turin]] and other territories in [[Piedmont]], a region in northwestern Italy that borders Savoy, which were also possessions of the House of Savoy. The capital of the Duchy remained at the traditional Savoyard capital of [[Chambéry]] until 1563, when it was moved to Turin.

==History==

===Early history===
The region was occupied by the [[Allobroges]], a [[Gauls|Gaulish]] people&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Savoy}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Roman Republic]] subdued in 121 BC.  The name ''Savoy'' stems from the [[Late Latin]] ''[[Sapaudia]]'', referring to a [[fir]] forest.&lt;ref group=n&gt;Modern French ''sapin''; ''sapinière'' signifies "fir forest".&lt;/ref&gt; The word is likely ultimately from Gaulish -- sapin itself is a blend of Gaulish ''sappos'' (fir tree) and Latin ''pinus'' (pine tree). It is first recorded in [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (354), to describe the southern part of ''[[Sequani|Maxima Sequanorum]]''.{{refn|group=n|The territory, which has no modern counterpart, was perhaps bounded by the rivers Ain and Rhône, [[Lake Geneva]], the Jura and the Aar, though historians differ, and there seems to be insufficient evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Norman H. Baynes, reviewing A. Coville, ''Recherches sur l'Histoire de Lyon du Ve au IXe Siècle (450–800)'' in ''The English Historical Review'' '''45''' No. 179 (July 1930:470 474) p 471.&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to the [[Chronica Gallica of 452|''Chronica Gallica'' of 452]], it was separated from the rest of [[Burgundians|Burgundian]] territories in 443, after the Burgundian defeat by [[Flavius Aetius]].{{refn|group=n|''Sapaudia Burgundionum reliquiis datur cum indigenis dividenda.''&lt;ref&gt;T. Mommsen, ''Chronica Minora'' II:660, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Early and High Middle Ages===
[[File:Italy 1494.svg|thumbnail|Duchy of Savoy (red) and other Italian states in 1494.]]
{{further|County of Savoy}}
By the 8th century, the territory that would later become known as Savoy was part of [[Francia]], and at the division of Francia at the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843, it became part of the short-lived kingdom of [[Middle Francia]]. After only 12 years, at the death of [[Lothair I]] in 855, Middle Francia was divided into [[Lotharingia]] north of the Alps, [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy south of the Alps]], and the parts of Burgundy in the Western Alps, inherited by [[Charles of Provence]]. This latter territory comprised what would become known as Savoy and [[Provence]].

From the 10th to 14th century, parts of what would ultimately become Savoy remained within the [[Kingdom of Arles]]. Beginning in the 11th century, the gradual rise to power of the [[House of Savoy]] is reflected in the increasing territory of their [[County of Savoy]] between 1003 and 1416.

The County of Savoy was   detached ''de jure'' from the Kingdom of Arles by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1361. It acquired  the [[County of Nice]] in 1388, and in 1401   added the [[County of Geneva]], the area of [[Geneva]] except for the city proper, which was ruled by its [[prince-bishop]], nominally under the duke's rule: the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg|bishops of Geneva]], by unspoken agreement, came from the [[House of Savoy]]; this agreement came to an end in 1533.&lt;ref group=n&gt;See the career of the last prince-bishop [[Pierre de La Baume]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duchy of Savoy===
{{main article|Duchy of Savoy}}
[[Image:Savoy2.png|thumb|320px|Map of Savoy in the 16th century. White lines are modern borders]]
On February 19, 1416, [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]], made the County of Savoy an independent [[Duchy of Savoy|duchy]], with [[Amadeus VIII of Savoy|Amadeus VIII]] as the first duke.  Straddling the Alps, Savoy lay within two competing spheres of influence, a French sphere and a North Italian one.  At the time of the Renaissance, Savoy showed only modest development.&lt;ref name="Lucas_42"&gt;Henry S. Lucas, ''The Renaissance and the Reformation'' (Harper &amp; Bros. Publishers: New York, 1960) p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its towns were few and small.&lt;ref name="Lucas_42"/&gt; Savoy derived its subsistence from agriculture.&lt;ref name="Lucas_42"/&gt; The geographic location of Savoy was also of military importance.&lt;ref name="Lucas_42"/&gt; During the [[Italian Wars|interminable wars]] between France and Spain over the control of northern Italy, Savoy was important to France because it provided access to Italy.&lt;ref name="Lucas_42"/&gt; Savoy was important to Spain because it served as a buffer between France and the Spanish held lands in Italy.&lt;ref name="Lucas_42"/&gt; In 1563 [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]] moved the capital from [[Chambéry]] to [[Turin]], which was less vulnerable to French interference.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Katz, ''The Fall of the House of Savoy'' (The MacMillan Company: New York, 1971) p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vaud]] was annexed by [[history of Bern|Bern]] in 1536, and Savoy officially ceded Vaud to Bern in the Treaty of Lausanne of 30 October 1564.

In 1714, as a consequence of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], Savoy was technically subsumed into the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], then (after that island was traded to [[Austria]] for [[Sardinia]]) the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] from 1720.
While the heads of the House of Savoy were known as the Kings of Sardinia, Turin remained their capital.

===French Revolutionary Wars===
[[File:Italy 1796.svg|thumbnail|Map of Savoy in the 18th century and other Italian states in 1796.]]

Savoy was occupied by [[French Revolutionary Army|French revolutionary forces]] between 1792 and 1815. The region was first added to the département of [[Mont-Blanc (department)|Mont-Blanc]], then in 1798 was divided between the départements of Mont-Blanc and [[Léman (department)|Léman]] (French name of Lake Geneva.) In 1801, Savoy officially left the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Heiliges Römisches Reich#Reichsgebiet und Bevölkerung|Heiliges Römisches Reich]]&lt;/ref&gt; On September 13, 1793 the combined forces of Savoy, Piedmont and [[Aosta Valley]] fought against and lost to the occupying French forces at the [[Battle of Méribel]] (Sallanches). Two-thirds of Savoy was restored to the Kingdom of Sardinia in the First Restoration of 1814 following Napoleon's abdication; approximately one-third of Savoy, including the two most important cities of Chambéry and Annecy, remained in France. Following Napoleon's brief return to power during the Hundred Days and subsequent defeat at Waterloo, the remaining one-third of Savoy was restored to the Kingdom of Sardinia at the [[Congress of Vienna]] to strengthen Sardinia as a buffer state on France's southeastern border.

===Modern history===
From 1815 until 1860, Savoy was part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]].

====Annexation to France====
[[File:Rattachement Savoie-France - Chambéry (1860).jpg|thumb|left|People of [[Chambéry]] with [[French flag]]s celebrating the annexation in 1860.]]
[[File:Italy 1843.svg|thumbnail|Map of Savoy in the 19th century and other Italian states in 1843.]]

The [[French Second Republic]] first attempted to annex Savoy in 1848. A corps of 1,500 was dispatched from Lyon and invaded Savoy on 3 April, occupying the capital, Chambéry, and proclaiming the annexation to France. On learning about the invasion countrymen rushed to Chambéry. The corps were chased away by the local population. Five Frenchmen were killed and 800 captured.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Rapport, ''1848: Year of Revolution'' (Basic Books, 2010), 115–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 1858 in Plombières (Vosges) the prime minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia, [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]], met in secret with [[Napoleon III]] to secure French military support against the [[Austrian Empire]] during the conflicts associated with the [[Italian unification]]. During the discussion, Cavour promised that Sardinia would cede the [[County of Nice]] and Duchy of Savoy to the [[Second French Empire]]. Though this was a secret arrangement, it quickly became widely known.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell]], address to the House of Common, July 5, 1861,[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1861/jul/05/question-2 HC Deb 05 July 1861 vol 164 cc436-61]&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty annexing Nice and Savoy to France was signed in Turin on March 24, 1860 ([[Treaty of Turin (1860)|Treaty of Turin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mjp.univ-perp.fr/traites/1860turin.htm | title = Traité de Turin, Signé à Turin le 24 mars 1860 entre la France et la Sardaigne. | accessdate = 2010-01-01 | publisher =  mjp.univ-perp.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern provinces of the Chablais and Faucigny, there was some support for annexation to neighboring Switzerland, with which the northern provinces had longstanding economic ties. To help reduce the attractiveness of Switzerland, the French government conceded a free-trade Zone that maintained the longstanding duty-free relationship of northern Savoyard communes to Geneva. The treaty was followed on April 22–23 by a [[referendum|plebiscite]] employing universal male suffrage, in which voters were offered the option of voting "yes" to approve the treaty and join [[France]] or rejecting the treaty with a no vote. The disallowed options of either joining [[Switzerland]], remaining with [[Italy]], or regaining its independence, were the source of some opposition. With a 99.8% vote in favour of joining France, there were allegations of [[vote-rigging]], notably by the British government, which opposed continental expansion by its traditional French enemy.

The correspondent of ''[[The Times]]'' in Savoy who was in [[Bonneville, Haute-Savoie|Bonneville]] on April 22 called the vote "the lowest and most immoral farce(s) which was ever played in the history of nations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/archive/ The Times], April 28, 1860, [http://blog.regionleman.com/post/annexion-rattachement-reunion-annexation-savoie-savoy-150-ans-anniversaire Universal Suffrage In Savoy].&lt;/ref&gt; He finished his letter with those words: &lt;blockquote&gt; I leave you to draw your own conclusions from this trip, which will show clearly what the vote was in this part of Savoy. The vote was the bitterest irony ever made on popular suffrage. The ballot-box in the hands of those very authorities who issued the proclamations; no control possible; even travellers suspected and dogged lest they should pry into the matter; all opposition put down by intimidation, and all liberty of action completely taken away. One can really scarcely reproach the Opposition with having given up the game; there was too great force used against them. As for the result of the vote, therefore, no one need trouble himself about it; it will be just as brilliant as that in Nice. The only danger is lest the Savoy authorities in their zeal should fare as some of the French did in the vote of 1852, finding to their surprise rather more votes than voters inscribed on the list. &lt;/blockquote&gt; In his letter to the ambassador of Vienna Lord A. Loftus, the then-[[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]], [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell]], said, "Voting in Savoy and Nice a farce ... we are neither entertained or edified".&lt;ref&gt;PRO 30/22/98 Austria.

The annexation was promulgated on June 14, 1860. On August 23, 1860 and March 7, 1861, two agreements were signed between the Second French Empire and the Kingdom of Sardinia to settle the remaining issues concerning the annexation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cngDAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false

[[Image:ChâteauChambéry1.JPG|thumb|left|The Château de Chambéry, seat of government, was given a grand new façade following annexation]]

====20th century====
In 1919, France officially (but contrary to the annexation treaty) ended the military neutrality of the parts of the country of Savoy that had originally been agreed to at the [[Congress of Vienna]], and also eliminated the [[free trade zone]] – both treaty articles having been broken unofficially in [[World War I]].  France was condemned in 1932 by the international court for noncompliance with the measures of the Treaty of Turin regarding the provinces of Savoy and Nice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8XYtAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA1&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title = La vérité sur la zone franche de la Haute-Savoie, F.Murullaz.

In 1960, the term ''annexation'' having acquired negative connotations in France, particularly after Germany's 1871 annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, the annexation was renamed ''Rattachement de la Savoie à la France'' (Incorporation of Savoy to France).{{refn|group=n|The word ''rattachement'' (incorporation) was preferred to ''réunion'' which may remind of the [[Anschluss#Legacy|Anschluss]].}} It was the latter term which was used by the French authorities during the festivities celebrating the 100th anniversary of the annexation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://doc-iep.univ-lyon2.fr/Ressources/Documents/Etudiants/Memoires/MFE2001/lacharmea/these.html La Savoie au miroir du Centenaire de son Rattachement à la France], Lacharme Amandine&lt;/ref&gt;  Daniel Rops of the [[Académie française|French Academy]] justified the new title with these words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Savoy has begun to solemnize the feasts in 1960, commemorating the centenary of its incorporation (''rattachement'') to France. It is on purpose that the word incorporation (''rattachement'') is highlighted here: the Savoyards attach great value to it, and it is the only one they have resolved to use in the official terminology of the Centenary. In that, they are infinitely right.
Yesterday another term that was used: annexation. Looking at it more closely it was wrong! Can we say annexation when we talk about a decision which was approved by 130,889 voters over 135,449? [...]. Savoy was not annexed [...] but actually incorporated freely and by the will of its inhabitants.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
A former French deputy, P. Taponnier, spoke of the annexation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In late March 1860, the betrothal ceremony of Savoy to France took place in Tuileries Palace [...], a ceremony which was a pact of love and fidelity [...] it is with free consent that she [Savoy] gave itself to France by a solemn plebiscite of which our leaders can ignore neither the terms nor the commitments. [...] May the bells of our cities [...] in Savoy vibrate in unison to glorify, in this magnificent Centenary, the indefectible commitment of Savoy to France.
The Savoyards did not feel Italian. Besides, they spoke French. This explains why in 1858–1859 when rumours ran of the Plombières secret agreement, where Napoleon III and Cavour decided of the fate of Savoy, the Savoyards themselves took the initiative to ask for the incorporation (''rattachement''). [...] Incorporation, not annexation [...] The incorporation was an act of free will, in the logical order of geography and history [...].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Modern regionalist politics==

Since the mid-20th century, regionalist movements have appeared in Savoy much as in other historic provinces of France. The ''[[Mouvement Région Savoie]]'' (Savoy Regional Movement) was founded in December 1971 as a 'movement' (rather than a traditional political party) in favour of regional autonomy. Unlike other historic provinces, including Normandy and Brittany, Savoy does not currently have its own [[Regions of France|region]] within France and is part of the [[Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes]] region. In the 1996 local elections, the Savoy Regional Movement received 19,434 votes; it received 4,849 in the 1998 regional elections. A new non-party organisation, ''La Région Savoie, j’y crois !'' (''I believe in the Savoy Region!''), was founded in 1998. The organisation campaigns for the replacement of the Savoie and Haute-Savoie departments with a regional government, separate from the [[Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes]] [[List of regions in France|region]], with greater [[devolution|devolved powers]].

A very marginal [[Separatism|separatist]] movement has also appeared in Savoy within the past twenty years, most prominently represented by the ''[[Ligue Savoisienne]]'', founded in 1994. In the March 1998 regional elections, 1 seat (out of 23) was won by Patrice Abeille, leader of the Ligue, which won a total of 17,865 votes across the two departments. In 2004, ''Waiting for Freedom in Savoy''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wffis.org/  Waiting for Freedom in Savoy]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded to promote the peaceful separatist cause to young people.

According to surveys conducted in 2000, between 41% and 55% of the population were in favour of the proposal for a separate Savoy region, while 19% to 23% were in favour of separation from France. Towards the end of 2005, [[Hervé Gaymard]] called for Savoie to be given special status, similar to a French region, under his proposed "Conseil des Pays de Savoie".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regionsavoie.com/fichiers/CDP_du_031105.pdf Région Savoie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316085457/http://www.regionsavoie.com/fichiers/CDP_du_031105.pdf |date=2007-03-16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern historiographical debates==

In recent years{{when|date=August 2014}}, sparked by the tiny Savoyard separatist movement, much attention has been focused on questioning the validity of the 1860 annexation. The Ligue Savoisienne, for example, rejects the Treaty of Turin and subsequent plebiscite as null and void, arguing that the plebiscite did not meet the standards of a free and fair vote. Today, historians generally acknowledge that the plebiscite of 1860 did feature irregularities, but they also affirm that the annexation instrument was the Treaty of Turin and not the plebiscite, whose main purpose was to demonstrate favorable public opinion in Savoy for the annexation after the signature of the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savoie.fr/archives73/expo_annexion/pano_5_/thumb.html 1860, La Savoie de l'Annexion], Archives Départementales de la Savoie&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for the newspaper ''[[Le Dauphiné Libéré]]'', Sylvain Milbach, a historian at the [[University of Savoy]], qualifies the vote as Napoleonic, but also argues that a completely free and fair vote would not have dramatically changed the outcome, as the majority of Savoyards wished to become French.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ledauphine.com/savoie-francaise-sylvain-milbach-le-oui-etait-acquis--@/index.jspz?article=122676 Savoie Française: Sylvain Milbach: «Le "oui" était acquis»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424095425/http://www.ledauphine.com/savoie-francaise-sylvain-milbach-le-oui-etait-acquis--@/index.jspz?article=122676 |date=2009-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is today the official stance of the [[Departements of France|General Council]] of [[Savoie]].

'''Semanggi Incerchange''' ({{lang-id|Simpang Susun Semanggi}}) is a major road junction in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]] which connects [[Central Jakarta]], [[South Jakarta]], [[East Jakarta]] and [[West Jakarta]] without any traffic lights. Semanggi intersection comprises the shape of a four-leaved cloverleaf (Semanggi in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]). Two main roads of the city [[Jalan Jenderal Gatot Subroto|Gatot Subroto Road]] and [[Jalan Jenderal Sudirman|Sudirman Road]] intersects at the Semanggi cloverleaf bridge. This is a landmark and an important arterial road in the [[Golden  Triangle of Jakarta]], an area of Jakarta’s business district.

==History==
This interchange was built in 1960s as part of infrastructure development for [[1962 Asian Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Merrillees|2015|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named as Semanggi (cloverleaf) by [[Soekarno]] with one bridge and four leaves symbolizing the unification of the territory of the city, as well as a symbol of Indonesian national unity. There is a myth in [[Ireland]], that the four-leaf [[clover]] is a lucky clover that is believed to bring good luck. It is said that the area of [[Setiabudi, South Jakarta|Karet]] in Jakarta, where the interchange is located was the swamp that grew Semanggi (clover) plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.netralnews.com/news/megapolitan/read/90528/djarot.ungkap.filosofi.di.balik.nama....|title=Djarot Ungkap Filosofi di Balik Nama ‘Simpang Susun Semanggi‘|newspaper=Netralnews|accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Governor of Jakarta]] revealed a plan to build two elevated roads around the Semanggi cloverleaf in an attempt to reduce traffic congestion in the area, from Ratu Plaza in South Jakarta to Cawang in East Jakarta and from Grogol in West Jakarta to Kebayoran Baru in South Jakarta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/07/02/city-build-two-elevated-roads-semanggi-cloverleaf.html|title=City to build two elevated roads at Semanggi cloverleaf|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2017/07/14/14123341/djarot-ingin-nama-simpang-susun-semanggi-sesuai-rencana-ahok|title=Djarot Ingin Nama Simpang Susun Semanggi Sesuai Rencana Ahok|newspaper=Kompas|accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flyover is built above the existing Semanggi intersection in front of the well-known [[Plaza Semanggi|Semanggi shopping mall]] in South Jakarta. The elevated roads will cater to vehicles traveling from [[Grogol]], [[West Jakarta]] to [[Senayan, Kebayoran Baru|Senayan]], [[South Jakarta]], and from [[Jalan Jenderal Sudirman|Sudirman]] (Central/South Jakarta) to [[Cawang, Kramat Jati, East Jakarta|Cawang]], [[East Jakarta]]. The West-South ramp is 769 meters long (between 6 to 11 meters above ground level). The other ramp is approximately 826 meters long with a height of up to 11.5 meters. It was opened to traffic on 28 July, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/07/29/semanggi-interchange-opens-motorists.html|title=Semanggi Interchange opens to motorists|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slavia Friulana''', which means '''Friulian Slavia''' (or '''Beneška Slovenija''' in [[Slovene language|Slovenian]]), is a small mountainous region in northeastern [[Italy]] and it is so called because of its Slavic population which settled here in the 8th century AD. The territory is located in the Italian region of [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]], between the town of [[Cividale del Friuli]] and the Slovenian border.

== Extent ==
The term ''Slavia Friulana'' could possibly be used to refer to all Friulian territories with a Slavic presence, including the [[Comune|municipalities]] of [[Lusevera]], [[Taipana]], [[Torreano]], [[Resia, Friuli|Resia]] and the mountainous areas of the municipalities of [[Tarcento]], [[Nimis]], [[Attimis]], [[Faedis]], [[Prepotto]] and [[Montenars]]. Despite that, in the last decades the name has been used to indicate the area also known as ''Valli del Natisone'' (Natisone Valleys) which was called '''Antro''' in the Middle Ages and then '''Schiavonìa''' during the Venetian domination: nowadays, the area is divided into the [[Comune|municipalities]] of [[San Pietro al Natisone]], [[San Leonardo, Italy|San Leonardo]], [[Pulfero]], [[Drenchia]], [[Grimacco]], [[Stregna]], [[Savogna]].

== Name ==	
Since the beginning of the 8th century AD (c. 720), Slavic people settled in this area and in the Middle Ages they would have been called ''Sclavons''. In the early 16th century, the Venetian authorities dubbed this border region of their Republic as ''Schiavonia Veneta'', meaning "Venetian Slav-land". The [[Venetian language|Venetian]] words ''Schiavoni'' and ''Schiavonia'' were general terms used for all [[South Slavic peoples]] with which they came in direct contact, Slovenes as well as for [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]] from [[Dalmatia]]. In 1884 the local historian Carlo Podrecca named the area ''Slavia Italiana'', as well as Slovene nationalists in 1875 started to use the toponym ''Beneška Slovenija'' (Venetian Slovenia) or ''Benečija'' (which means ''Veneto'').
	
After World War I, as soon as the Italian kingdom expanded its borders eastwards (including vast slavophone territories in Istria and in the so-called [[Kingdom of Illyria (1816–49)|Habsburgic Illyrian kingdom]]), the region started to be commonly called ''Slavia Friulana'' instead of a generic ''Slavia Italiana''.

== History ==
[[Image:Castelmonte 0904.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The sanctuary of [[Castelmonte]] (''Stara Gora'') has been the most important religious centre of Slavia Veneta since the 11th century.]]

===Early periods===
{{Further|Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps}}
In the early 8th century Slavic tribes settled within the border of the [[Lombard Kingdom|Lombard Duchy of ''Forumiulii'']]. [[Paulus Diaconus]], a Lombard historian at the court of [[Charlemagne]], mentioned the local Slavs from the region in his magnum opus ''Historia Langobardorum''. They were incorporated into the [[Frankish Empire]] and [[Christianized]] maybe by missionaries from [[Aquileia]], one of the most important centers of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in Northern Italy. 

From the 9th century onward, the region belonged first to the [[Duchy of Friuli]] and later to the [[Patriarchal State of Friuli|Patriarchate of Aquileia]]. In 1420 the Patriarchate of Aquileia was invaded by the [[Republic of Venice]].

===The Venetian domination===
[[File:Flag of Beneška Slovenija.svg|thumb|Schiavona - Flag of Slavia Veneta/Friulana]]
The Venetian authorities decided to absorb the "gastaldia di Antro" in the Cividale's one, but at the same time they gave the local [[Slavs]] a remarkable autonomy. In fact, the territory was structured in two co-valleys (Antro and Merso) represented by their people's assemblies called ''arenghi''; each co-valley had also the right to elect its own judges and its own tribunals (''banche'') whose judiciary power was extended in the villages that weren't object of feudal investitures; the whole Schiavonia had important tax benefits and the only military duties were to provide 200 men for the border defense against the neighbouring [[Habsburg Empire]] and fortify the near city of Cividale and the fortress of Palmanova as well. The ancient and commercial street of the Natisone valley, which connected the German world to the Adriatic sea and Italy, lost its importance soon afterwards the Habsburgs inherited the county of Gorizia (1500) and conquered the "gastaldia" of Tolmino (1516); the Austrians built another street passing along the border and this caused a heavy economic damage to the whole area which became much poorer than it was before.

===The Napoleonic and Austrian rule===
In 1797, most of the Venetian Republic was annexed to the [[Habsburg Empire]], including Schiavonia Veneta. The Habsburg authorities abolished the ancient privileges of the local Slav populations, as they had already done with a similar system of autonomy in neighboring [[Tolmin|Tolmin County]] in 1717. In 1805, the region was submitted to the [[Napoleon]]ic rule, which did not restore the privileges, but replaced the old boroughs with French-style townships, led by government-appointed mayors. In 1813, the region fell again under Habsburg domain and in 1815 it was included in the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] administrative unit of [[Lombardy-Venetia]]. Most of the reforms introduced by the French authorities were kept. The local population fought bravely for Italian unity in 1848 and 1864. In 1866, the region became part of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]] by a [[referendum]] (won with 3687 votes against 1), with the exception of the villages of Breginj and Livek which were included in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] [[Gorizia and Gradisca|County of Gorizia and Gradisca]].

===Under the Kingdom of Italy===
{{main|Slovene minority in Italy (1920–47)}}
[[Image:Ucceatal Sella Carnizza 14072007 01.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Carnizza, linking the upper [[Torre River|Torre]] Valley with the [[Resia, Friuli|Resia]] Valley.]]
The Italian policy was aimed to improve the quality of life, local economy, education: in the first eighteen years, schools and streets were improved five times more than the Austrian domination lasted fiftythree years. The Italian language remained the official one as it was in the previous centuries (under Venice, France and Austria). The local population was considered made of "Italians with a Slav origin"; the local traditions were respected and there was the need to teach a common language to be understood in the whole State. During this period, the region became a major focus of historians, linguists and ethnologists, interested in its archaic customs, language and common law. Scholars who wrote about Slavia Friulana included the Italo-Slavs [[Carlo Podrecca]] and [[Francesco Musoni]], the Polish linguist [[Jan Niecisław Baudouin de Courtenay]], the Slovenes [[Simon Rutar]] and [[Henrik Tuma]].

After 1870, when Italy conquered Rome reducing the pope's territories to the Vatican City, also the Italo-Slav priests (which fought for the union to Italy in the precedent decades) started a hard political action against the new kingdom: for this reason they refused to consider themselves Italians but Slovenes. This trend became even more pronounced after the annexation of the [[Julian March]] to the Kingdom of Italy in 1920, when a large Slovene-speaking minority was included within the borders of the Italian state. The local politicians, instead, continued to support the Italian policy: this concerned both the conservatives and the progressives.

After a dozen years of Fascist regime, all public and religious use of other languages were forbidden. This feature was further emphasized by the Slovene anti-fascist and nationalist propaganda (both left-wing and conservative-Catholic), which frequently portrayed the Slavia Friulana as the symbol of Slovene resistance to Fascist Italianization, often simplifying the complex linguistic and social realities of the region. The most famous, and filo Slovene, literary portrayal was written in 1938 by the Slovene writer [[France Bevk]] from [[Gorizia]] in his novel "The Vicar Martin Čedermac" (''Kaplan Martin Čedermac'').&lt;ref&gt; Set in Slavia Friulana, the novel, published under a pseudonym in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] town of [[Ljubljana]], described the efforts of a local Roman Catholic priest to preserve the use of Slovene language in church against the policies of the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] regime. The novel became a best seller in Slovenia and the term ''Čedermac'' has been since used as a synonym for the clergy persecuted by the Fascists in the Italian-administered [[Julian March]] and in the Slavia Friulana.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]] the [[Slovene partisans|Slovene partisan resistance]], led by the [[Liberation Front of the Slovenian People]], penetrated in the region. The [[Kobarid Republic]] was established as a temporary administration after the [[Italian armistice]] in early September 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alpskival.net/11/o/1392 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723012330/http://www.alpskival.net/11/o/1392 |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In early November 1943, the [[Nazi German]] forces crushed the insurgency, and incorporated the whole area into the [[Operational Zone Adriatic Coast]]. In 1944, the [[Italian resistance movement]] also became active in the mountains of Slavia Friulana. Tensions between the Yugoslav (Slovene) and Italian resistance movements rose. The Liberation Front of the Slovenian People wanted to annex the region to a [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Communist federation]], while the Italian resistance was split between the [[Communist Party of Italy|Communists]] who partially supported the Yugoslav claims, and the Liberal-democratic who wanted Slavia Friulana to remain part of Italy. 

In February 1945, the [[Porzus massacre]] occurred, in which the  communist and filo-Yugoslav Italian partisans killed several members of the Italian liberal-democratic resistance members. In May 1945 the whole area was invaded by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]], which however withdrew a few weeks later after the British arrival. Liberal-democratic-catholic partisans, members of the Royal Army and the defeated fascist soldiers joined up together to fight the communists and the Yugoslavs.

===Italian Republic===
{{main|Slovene minority in Italy}}
[[Image:Segnaletiche bilengâl a San Pieri.jpg|thumb|left|The first [[bilingual sign]]s in Slavia Friulana were erected in the late 1990s.]]
In 1945, Slavia Friulana again became an integral part of Italy. It was included in the [[Regions of Italy|region]] of [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]]. Between 1945 and 1947, Slavia Friulana was a region on the border with the [[Communist Bloc]], and it was listed as a special operational zone of [[Operation Gladio|Gladio]], a clandestine [[NATO]] "[[stay-behind]]" operation in Italy after World War II, intended to counter a possible [[Warsaw Pact]] invasion of [[Western Europe]]. The activists of Gladio were mostly local members of the ''Alpini'' troops.&lt;ref&gt;Natalino Zuanella, Gli anni bui della Slavia : attività delle organizzazioni segrete nel Friuli orientale (Cividale del Friuli: Società Cooperativa
Editrice Dom, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following decades, the presence of a militarized border didn't allow an economic and infrastructural development and this situation caused a widespread [[emigration]] during the same period. Europe's ideological division ignited in this area an ethnic one: local communists continued to support the Yugoslav socialist regime claiming the recognition of a [[Slovenes in Italy|Slovene minority]]; also a few priests continued to identify the population as Slovene. On the other hand, some locals consider themselves as Italo-slavs or nedižouci (inhabitants of the Natisone valley; singular: nedižovac) and rečanji (inhabitants of the Alberone, Erbezzo and Cosizza valleys; singular: rečanj). They claim to speak nediško, with ethnical differences by the Slovene neighbours. Although Yugoslavia started its dissolution after [[Josip Broz Tito]] died in 1980 and the cold war ended in 1989, this ethnic debate hasn't been cleared yet and it's still caged within an ideological contest.

Many of the villages lost more than two thirds of their populations, as Slavs from Friulian Slavia moved to larger urban areas in [[Northern Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]]. In May and September 1976, two earthquakes hit Friuli, causing large scale damages.

===After 1977===
Although the area was largely depopulated after 1977, the political pressure was lifted after the [[Treaty of Osimo]] between Italy and Yugoslavia, but with no economic improvement. Anyway, Slovene cultural activities started to take place in the early 1980s. In the early 1990s, the first elementary and high school in Slovene language was established in [[San Pietro al Natisone]], and in 2001, the Italian state recognized the local population as a Slovene minority living in the area, guaranteeing it full rights but ignoring the claims of those who consider themselves as non-Slovene. After Slovenia's entry into the [[European Union]] in 2004, the relations between the Slavia Friulana and the bordering [[Goriška]] region have intensified.

== Language, culture and religion ==
[[Image:Resia San Giorgio carneval music 03022008 78.jpg|thumb|left|The [[carnival]] in the [[Resia Valley]].]]
Most people in Slavia Friulana (considering the whole slavophone area) speak four different Slovene dialects, named after the major valleys that form those territories: first of all the [[Natisone Valley dialect]], the [[Torre Valley dialect]], the [[Resian dialect]] and the Iudrio Valleys. The first three are closely related to each other and Resian, instead, has its own peculiar characteristics. On the other hand, the Slovene spoken in the province of Gorizia is part of the [[Littoral dialect group]].

Almost all of the inhabitants are fluent in [[Italian language|Italian]], which is taught in schools and present in the media and in the administration. [[Friulian language|Friulian]] is also widespread, especially in the municipalities of [[Montenars]], [[Tarcento]], [[Nimis]], [[Attimis]], [[Torreano]], and [[Prepotto]]; in many villages in these municipalities, the Friulian language has already replaced Slav as the [[first language]] of communication. Because of the lack of education in the local Slav languages, most of the inhabitants do not master the standard Slovene language. Many don't understand it either, especially in the areas where the Slovenian TV and radio are not accessible, since standard Slovene is not entirely intelligible with the languages spoken in the region. They are however partially intelligible with the neighbouring Slovene dialects spoken in the [[Slovenian Littoral]], especially the [[Soča dialect|Soča]] and [[Brda dialect]]s, which actually were parts of the ancient Venetian Schiavonia and annexed to Habsburgs' county of Gorizia in the early 19th century.

The vast majority of the people belong to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the religion plays an important role in the local culture. The Roman Catholic priests have traditionally been the most important promoters of the Slovene language and culture in Slavia Friulana. Anyway, the linguistic matter hasn't been clarified yet. In the late 19th century, the polish linguist Jan Baudouin de Courtenay considered the four local languages as different Slav ones, rich of Paleoslav archaisms which make them often sound closer to Serb. He classified the four friulian Slavs groups as those of: Resia valley, Torre valleys, Natisone valleys and Judrio valleys.

In the last decades some local politicians have been asking for a popular referendum concerning the self-ethnic definition of these people, but the project has never been possible to carry out because it has been boycotted by the most ideologized groups. The referendum itself has been recently demanded by the European Union and in the meanwhile the first scientific studies about local languages have finally been published for a transparent debate.

Slavia Friulana is famous for its rich folk traditions. Numerous [[Folk music|folk]] and [[world music|ethno music]] bands come from the region, and many of them are extremely popular throughout [[Slovenia]] and the [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]]. The most famous of these bands are probably the ''[[Beneški fantje]]'' ("Venetian Lads"), which are considered to be oldest still existing Slovene band. Besides its archaic traditional music and dances, the [[Resia, Friuli|Resia]] valley is also famous for its folk tales, which were edited and translated into standard Slovene language by the Slovene scholar [[Milko Matičetov]] and published by the largest publishing house in Slovenia, [[Mladinska knjiga]], in 1976. They have been re-published in eight editions since, and have had a huge impact in popularizing the Friulian Slav folk culture in Slovenia.

Since the late 1980s, Slavia Friulana has also emerged as one of the major centres of high quality Slovene dialect poetry. The most famous poets from the region are [[Silvana Paletti]], [[Francesco Bergnach]] and [[Marina Cernetig]].

Since 1994, the artistic project ''Stazione di Topolò - Postaja Topolove'' or "Topolò Station" takes place every summer in the small village of Topolò ({{lang-sl|Topolovo}}, known as ''Topolove'' or ''Topoluove'' in the local dialect). The project, which is the most important cultural and artistic event in the region, is an attempt to bring together contemporary visual art with and the local folk traditions.

It grows on ancient sand [[dunes]] in northern [[KwaZulu-Natal]] and southern [[Mozambique]]. In [[South Africa]] these forests are known simply as '''Sand Forest''', while in Mozambique they are known as '''Licuati Forest'''.&lt;ref name="Wayne Matthews"&gt;{{cite web |title=Maputaland's Tembe Elephant National Park, - a little known reserve with many natural secrets |url=http://www.africaelephants.com/ecology.htm | author=Wayne Matthews |accessdate= 22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{Main|Sand forest}}
Sand forests are thought to be relics of coastal dune forests, which have been separated from the ocean for more than a million years as the shoreline has shifted slowly eastwards over the millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Duncan Butchart CC Africa |date=21 November 2006 |publisher=Wildwatch.com |title=Eyes on the wild |url=http://www.wildwatch.com/living_library/other-2/sand-forest |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806182947/http://www.wildwatch.com/living_library/other-2/sand-forest |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunes have accreted on the southeast African coastal plain since the [[Pliocene]],&lt;ref&gt;Soil chronosequence development in dunes on the southeast African coastal plain, Maputaland, South Africa Quaternary International Volumes 162-163, March 2007, Pages 111-132

Quaternary Science Reviews Volume 27, Issues 9-10, May 2008, Pages 1024-1046 Naomi Porat and Greg Botha&lt;/ref&gt; The geological history of the region suggests that the current [[ecosystem]]s here may be of recent derivation and many [[endemism|endemic]] plant taxa comply with the concept of neo-endemics (recent locally evolved species), and [[biological evolution]] (notably [[speciation]]) is still in an active phase.&lt;ref name="Wayne Matthews"/&gt;

==Characteristics==

Of the 225 [[Maputaland Centre of Plant Endemism|Maputaland Centre]] plant endemic species, 30 are associated with sand forest and 20 are restricted to this vegetation type.&lt;ref name="Wayne Matthews"/&gt; Species typical of moist forests, such as [[fern]]s and [[moss]]es are scarce, and the activities of [[termites]] appear to limit the accumulation of leaf litter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Duncan Butchart CC Africa |date=21 November 2006 |publisher=Wildwatch.com |title=eyes on the wild |url=http://www.wildwatch.com/living_library/other-2/sand-forest |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806182947/http://www.wildwatch.com/living_library/other-2/sand-forest |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sand forest has a distinct boundary and also exhibits a narrow zone of 1–2 m of nearly bare soil directly bordering it.&lt;ref name="Wayne Matthews"/&gt; There are indications that sand forest has [[allelopathic]] effects which may bring about this zone of inhibition and this aids in limiting fires spreading from the neighboring savannah into the forest; creating a unique environment for itself.&lt;ref name="Wayne Matthews"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1638">In [[microeconomics]], a '''threshold population''' is the minimum number of people needed for a [[Service (economics)|service]] to be worthwhile.

In [[geography]], a threshold population is the minimum number of people necessary before a particular [[Good (economics)|good]] or service can be provided in an area. The concept is equivalent to the "range" in [[central place theory]] and [[retailing]], which delineates the [[Market (economics)|market]] area of a central place for a particular good or service, and is dependent on the [[Population density|spatial distribution]] of population and the willingness of [[consumer]]s to travel a given distance to purchase particular goods or services.&lt;ref&gt;Goodall, B. (1987) The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically a low-order shop (such as a grocer or newsagent) may require only 800 or so customers, whereas a higher-order store such as Marks and Spencer or Waitrose may need a threshold of 70,000 to be profitable, and a university may need 350,000 to be viable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0034885.html Tiscali encyclopedia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012030055/http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0034885.html |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thresholds may also be linked to the spending power of customers; this is most obvious in periodic markets in poor countries, where wages are so low that people can buy the goods or services only once in a while.

[[File:1 Vallee dOosterlog entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the Vallee d'Oosterlog garden]]
'''Vallée d'Osterlog''' or '''Osterlog Valley''' is a [[botanical garden]] of Mauritian [[endemism|endemic]] species and a rehabilitated indigenous forest, situated in Le Val, in the south-east of [[Mauritius]].

It was founded on the 11 June 2014.

==Location==
[[File:1 Vallee de Oosterlog.jpg|thumb|left|]]
[[File:Vallee de Oosterlog forest 2.jpg|thumb|right|Endemic forest at the Vallée d'Osterlog]]
The 275 hectare garden &amp; forest is located in the region of Le Val, near [[Le Val Nature Park]] in the south-east of the island. It is in the Creole Mountain range, specifically between Mount Lagrave and Mount Laselle. It also lies almost exactly on the border of two districts - that of Grand Port and Moka. It is reached by road from Le Saint, Hubert Village. The offices of the Vallée d'Osterlog Endemic Garden Foundation are in Wooton, Eau Coulée.

'''Zeugma''' ({{lang-el|Ζεῦγμα}}) is an ancient [[city]] of [[Commagene]]; located in modern [[Gaziantep Province]], [[Turkey]]. It was named for the [[Pontoon bridge|bridge of boats]], or ''[[wikt:ζεῦγμα|zeugma]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|zeu{{=}}gma|ζεῦγμα|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that crossed the [[Euphrates|Euphrates river]] at that location.

== Historical background ==
Originally, the ancient city of Zeugma was founded as a Greek settlement by [[Seleucus I Nicator]], one of the generals of [[Alexander the Great]], in 300 BC. The city was called "Zeugma", because of the bridge across the Euphrates River that was made of pontoons, thus connecting the two banks of the river. In Greek, "zeugma" means “bridge” or “crossing”. The ancient term Zeugma actually referred to the twin cities on the opposing banks of the river. Today the name Zeugma is usually understood to refer to the settlement on the west bank, called Seleucia on the Euphrates ({{lang-el|Σελεύκεια}}) after the founder, while the one on the East bank was called [[Apamea (Euphrates)|Apamea]] after his Persian wife [[Apama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5726/ Archeological Site of Zeugma]&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the city at its peak was approximately 80,000.

In 64 BC the city was conquered and ruled by the [[Roman Empire]]. During Roman rule, the city became one of the attractions in the region, due to its commercial potential originating from its geo-strategic location because the city was on the [[Silk Road]] connecting [[Antioch]] to [[China]] via a bridge of pontoons across the river Euphrates, which defined the border with the Persian Empire until the late 2nd century.

In 256 AD, Zeugma experienced an invasion and was destroyed by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] king, [[Shapur I]]. The damage from the invasion was so drastic that Zeugma was not able to recover for a long time. To make the situation even worse, a violent earthquake buried the city beneath rubble. Indeed, during the rest of its time under Roman rule, the city never regained the prosperity it had once achieved.

Zeugma and environs remained part of the Roman empire. During the 5th and 6th centuries the city was ruled by the Early [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] or Eastern Roman Empire. As a result of the ongoing Arab raids the city was abandoned once again. Later on, in the 10th and 12th centuries, a small [[Abbassid|Abbasid]] group settled in Zeugma.

Finally a village called ''Belkis'' was founded at the site in the 17th century.

=== Legio IV ''Scythica'' era ===
[[File:Otacilia Severa-l4Scythica.jpg|thumb|300px|Coin issued by [[Philip the Arab]] for his wife Otacilia Severa, shown on obverse; on the reverse, a temple in Zeugma and in the exergue the [[Capricorn (astrology)|capricorn]], a reference to [[Legio IV Scythica|Legio IV ''Scythica'']]]]
During the era of Imperial Rome, the [[Legio IV Scythica|Legio IV ''Scythica'']] was camped in Zeugma. For about two centuries the city was home to many soldiers, high-ranking officials and officers of the Roman Empire, who transferred their cultural understanding and sophisticated lifestyle into the region. As a result, a Roman artistic character is seen in the [[necropolis]] [[sculpture]]: samples of beautiful art appear in the stelae, rock reliefs, statues, and altars. This unique trend in sculpture and art became a well-recognized regional style. Zeugma became considerably rich, owing to the economy created by soldiers in the legion. Moreover, a thriving trade moved across a wooden bridge connecting Zeugma to the city of [[Apamea (Euphrates)|Apamea]] on the other side of the Euphrates. Current excavations have revealed a large customs facility and indications of considerable border trade.

The proof for this assumption came in the excavations carried out in “Iskele üstü”. In this site, 65,000 [[seal (emblem)|seal]] imprints in clay, known as ''[[Bulla (seal)|bullae]]'', were found in what is believed to have served as the archives for the [[customs]] of ancient Zeugma. The seal imprints used in sealing papyrus, parchment, [[moneybags]], and customs bales reflect the volume of trade, the density of transportation, and the communication network once established in the region.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

== Recent excavations and the legacy of ancient Zeugma ==
In 1987 the Gaziantep Museum excavated two tomb chambers that had been broken into by antiquity smugglers in the necropolis southwest of Zeugma, revealing [[fresco]]s on the walls and statues on the terraces in front of the chambers. These statues are now in the [[Gaziantep Museum of Archaeology]]. In 1992 the watchman at the site, Nusret Özdemir, reported renewed illegal activity here, and a trench dug by antiquity hunters was discovered in the centre of the city. Excavations commenced on the same spot by a team from Gaziantep Museum led by director Rifat Ergeç, uncovered a Roman [[villa]] and magnificent [[mosaic]] pavements. The 1st century AD villa consisted of galleries around an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] with eight columns and rooms behind the galleries. The mosaic that adorned the villa's gallery depicted the marriage of [[Dionysus]], god of wine and grapes, to [[Ariadne]]. Six of the ten figures portrayed in this mosaic were stolen on 15 June 1998.

In further excavations here, part of the central panel of the mosaic pavement belonging to the terrace of another villa turned out to have been stolen long since, probably around 1965. The two figures are missing from the knees upward. The missing mosaic fragment later was found to be in the [[Menil Collection]] at [[Rice University]] in the city of [[Houston]]. The two figures seated side by side in this mosaic are the two legendary lovers, [[Ancient Greek novel|Metiochos and Parthenope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to the Ancient Novel| editor1-first=Edmund P.|editor1-last=Cueva|editor2-first=Shannon N.|editor2-last=Byrne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIeTAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=149|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|isbn=978-1-118-35041-6|year=2014|series=Blackwell Companions to the Ancient World}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of the Turkish Ministry of Culture, the stolen fragment was returned, and now the complete mosaic may be seen in Gaziantep Museum.

[[File:Antep erased2.jpg|thumb|250px|The "Gypsy Girl" mosaic fragment ([[Zeugma Mosaic Museum]])]]
[[File:Zeugma Barajı.jpg|thumb|250px|The Birecik-Dam]]
When mosaic fragments were discovered during construction of the [[Birecik Dam]] wall that commenced in 1996, Gaziantep Museum had the work halted while excavations were carried out that revealed a [[Roman bath]], [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], and 36 mosaic panels which were added to the museum collection. In 1997, on the clay quarry area in front of the dam wall a large Bronze Age cemetery was discovered and excavated. Nearly eight thousand pottery vessels were found in 320 graves going back to the early Bronze Age. The museum staff worked unceasingly through the winter 1998–1999, uncovering such important and beautiful finds as the Akratos and Gypsy Girl Mosaic and 65,000 bullae in an archive room at İskeleüstü, making Gaziantep Museum possessor of the largest collection of bullae in the world.

In 1999, in a building within the lower quarter of the city, mosaics depicting the head of [[Dionysus]] and [[Oceanus]] and [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] with sea creatures were discovered. From 1996 onward, with the threat of being submerged under the waters of the new dam, salvage excavations were carried out by C. Abadie Reynal of [[Nantes University]] in [[France]], together with archaeologists from Gaziantep and [[Şanlıurfa]] museums. In 1999 a mosaic pavement depicting the mythological [[Minos bull]] was discovered at Mezarliküstü, and at the end of the excavation season, further mosaics were visible at the thresholds of other rooms. Not wishing to leave the mosaics at the mercy of the treasure hunters who are so active in the area, the acting director of Gaziantep Museum, Fatma Bulgan, decided to continue excavations through the winter months. Despite difficult weather conditions they went on to uncover a fountain with its own tank at a depth of three metres, a marble figure of [[Apollo]], as well as, another mosaic pavement with nine figures depicting [[Achilles]] being taken by [[Odysseus]] to fight in the [[Trojan War]].

Also during salvage excavations under Mehmet Önal, an archaeologist from Gaziantep Museum, two more Roman villas were uncovered. These villas, which stood side by side, were burned and razed by the [[Sassanids]] in 252. The fact that they lay under three metres of rubble had protected them from treasure hunters. Their frescos, mosaics, and other artifacts were almost completely intact. A bronze statue of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], which aroused increased media interest in Zeugma, was found amongst storage jars in the larder of one of the villas. Altogether seventeen mosaic pavements have been revealed in the villas, whose walls were decorated with colourful frescoes.

Excavations of Zeugma have been divided into three areas, initial priority being given to salvage and documentation in Zone A, which sank under the dam waters in early July. Work then moved on to Zone B, which was scheduled for submersion in October 2000 when the dam water reached its maximum level of 385 metres. Zone C, on the other hand, consists of the higher parts of the city that will not be affected by the new dam.

A Zeugma excavation project conducted by [[Oxford Archaeology]] and supported by the Packard Humanities Institute of Los Altos, California and the Ministry of Culture of Turkey, has unearthed three more ancient Greek mosaics in Zeugma. Oxford Archaeology also issued a 2013 report on the project.&lt;ref&gt;Escamilla, Rebecca, ''[http://laughingsquid.com/archaeologists-unearth-three-ancient-greek-mosaics-in-the-ongoing-excavation-in-zeugma-turkey/ Archaeologists Unearth Three Ancient Greek Mosaics in the Ongoing Excavation in Zeugma, Turkey]'', Laughing Squid, November 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
