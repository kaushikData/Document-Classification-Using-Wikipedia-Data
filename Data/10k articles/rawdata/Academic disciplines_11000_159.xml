      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7625">'''Aaron ben Gershon Abu Al-Rabi''' of [[Catania]] (also '''Aaron ben Gershon Abualrabi''', '''Aaron Alrabi'''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Aronne Abulrabi'') was a [[History of the Jews in Sicily|Sicilian-Jewish]] scholar, cabalist, and astrologer of the 15th century.

==Life==
He was a son-in-law of Don Moses Gabbai, an exile from [[Majorca]]. Aaron was the youngest of five brothers, all rabbinic scholars; the others were Shallum, Baruch, Moses, and Isaac. He studied in [[Treviso]], [[Italy]], and was familiar with the scientific and philosophic literature of his age; he was a good grammarian, and well acquainted with the [[Arabic language]]. Like his father, he believed in astrology, and loved to observe the horoscope. He was also an adept in the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]], though at times his critical spirit came in conflict with its doctrines. On his travels he visited [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Damascus]], and [[Feodosiya#Caffa|Kaffa]] in the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]. In [[Jerusalem]] he had many disputations with the [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]], to which his commentary on the [[Pentateuch]] refers with evident pride, as having vindicated the cause of rabbinical theology. While in [[Rome]] he was admitted to the presence of [[Pope Martin V]], who was surrounded by his cardinals. Martin V was kindly disposed toward the [[Jews]], and often discussed religious questions with them in a friendly manner. On this occasion he propounded to Aaron a number of very pointed questions concerning Biblical and Talmudical passages. Among other things he asked if the use of the [[cherubim]] in the Holy of Holies was not rather antagonistic to the [[You shall not make for yourself an idol|Second Commandment]], which prohibits [[idolatry]]. Aaron in his commentary refers several times to this discussion and to the answers he gave.

==Writer==
Coming often in contact with learned Christians, Aaron had many occasions to defend Judaism against the polemics of the Church, on the one hand, and the attacks of the Karaites on the other. It was this unceasing conflict that induced him to write a book, called "Maṭṭeh Aharon" (The Staff of Aaron), in defense of the Law and tradition. Keenly observant, and of an independent and critical spirit, he judged persons and opinions freely and openly. He excels as a writer and as a Bible commentator, and often upbraids the Jews of his native land for their ignorance and hollow pretensions, at the same time pointing with admiration to the numerous Jews of high breeding he has met on his travels. Following the principle of a rational Biblical [[exegesis]], he does not hesitate occasionally to refute [[haggadic]] traditions which seem to conflict with reason and common sense; and at times, like [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] and [[Samuel ben Meir]], he even states his disagreement with [[halakic]] interpretation. He was fully conversant with the views of the Karaites and [[Samaritans]] and eager, in his explanation of the Bible, to refute now Christian and now [[Muslim]] doctrines. He boldly exposes errors wherever he finds them, claiming "that it is more honorable for the wise to commit an error than knowingly to misrepresent the truth."

Nor does he shrink from pointing out the blemishes he finds in the character of the Patriarchs. Being guided solely by a love of truth, he, as a matter of course, does not spare such great Bible commentators as [[Rashi]] and [[Nahmanides]]. For the former Aaron entertained a very high regard; of the latter he frequently says, "With due deference to his honor, he misunderstood the Talmud" (see his commentary upon Gen. xxvii. 22; Ex. xxiii. 11, xxv. 9). Like Samuel ben Meir and Maimonides, he explains the law, "Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk" (Ex. xxiii. 19), as a warning against a certain idolatrous practise. Notwithstanding his liberal mind and his keen investigating spirit, he was held in high esteem by his contemporaries, as may be seen from [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|David Abi Zimra's]] mention of him as "Aaron our Rabbi" in No. 10 of his responsa, where he commends him for his liberty of thought. He was a devoted Jew, who deeply deplored the political and social condition of the Jews of his time, and all the more fervently gave expression to his hope for the speedy advent of the Messiah. For his cabalistic views he quotes [[Recanate]] and [[Joseph Sar Shalom]], but not the [[Zohar]].

==Works==
Aaron states that he wrote a [[Hebrew grammar]] entitled "''Ha-Meyasher''" (''The Leveler of the Road''); "''Maṭṭeh Aharon''," referred to above, a cabalistic or metaphysical work; "''Nezer ha-Ḳodesh''" (''The Crown of Holiness''); "''Peraḥ ha-Elohut''" (''The Blossoming of the Godhead''), probably of a similar character, and "''Sefer ha-Nefesh''" (''The Book of the Soul''). All of these works are known only through his own quotations in his supercommentary on Rashi. This work, published from an incomplete manuscript, together with another supercommentary on Rashi by [[Samuel Almosnino]], by [[Moses Albelda]], and by [[Jacob Canizal]], is one of the earliest books printed at Constantinople, and is therefore very rare. According to his own testimony, it was written in 1420 (as Perles has shown); but he intended to compose, or, as Perles thinks, actually did compose, a larger commentary on the Pentateuch. Perles has furnished ample proof that Aaron Aldabi—or, as he called himself, Aaron Alrabi—was a man of great originality and merit, and it is to be hoped that his lost works will be discovered, and that editions of his commentary, based on clear manuscripts existing in Oxford and elsewhere, will fully vindicate his character, though Graetz and Karpeles, in their histories, have attacked him.

J. H. Schorr, in "Zion," 1840, first called attention to Abu al-Rabi, erroneously calling him Aaron ben Mose Alrabi; but, owing to a misunderstanding of his remarks, he ascribes to him the strange assertion that Moses translated the Pentateuch from the Arabic into Hebrew—a misunderstanding repeated by Grätz, "Gesch. d. Juden" (third edition), viii. 250, and by Karpeles, "Gesch. der Jüdischen Literatur," p.&amp;nbsp;771—whereas the author, in his commentary upon Gen. xviii. 5, referring to the rabbinical Haggadah that the angels who came to Abraham appeared as Arabs, says that they spoke in Arabic, and that Moses rendered their words in Hebrew—a remark which he repeats in his comments upon Gen. xxiv. 23 and Ex. ii. 10. Zunz, "Z. G.," pp.&amp;nbsp;518–520, and Steinschneider, "Cat. Bodl.," call him Alrabi. Aaron's true name, however, is given in the acrostic written by him at the end of his published commentary.

'''Allan Hills 84001''' (commonly abbreviated '''ALH84001'''&lt;ref name=database&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.php?sea=alh+84001&amp;sfor=names&amp;ants=&amp;falls=&amp;stype=contains&amp;lrec=50&amp;map=ge&amp;browse=&amp;country=All&amp;srt=name&amp;categ=All&amp;mblist=All&amp;phot=&amp;snew=0&amp;pnt=no&amp;code=604|title=Meteoritical Bulletin Database: Allan Hills 84001}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Martian meteorite]] that was found in [[Allan Hills]], [[Antarctica]] on December 27, 1984, by a team of U.S. meteorite hunters from the [[ANSMET]] project. Like other members of the group of [[Martian meteorite|SNC]]s ([[shergottite]], [[nakhlite]], [[chassignite]]), ALH84001 is thought to be from [[Mars]]. However, it does not fit into any of the previously discovered SNC groups. On discovery, its [[mass]] was {{Convert|1.93|kg}}.

In 1996, a group of scientists claimed to have found evidence for microscopic fossils of Martian bacteria in the meteorite, culminating in then U.S. president Bill Clinton giving a speech about the potential discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/clinton.html|title=President Clinton Statement Regarding Mars Meteorite Discovery|author=|date=|website=www2.jpl.nasa.gov|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims were controversial from the beginning, and the wider scientific community ultimately rejected the hypothesis once all the unusual features in the meteorite had been explained without requiring life to be present. Despite there being no convincing evidence of Martian life, the initial paper and scientific and public attention caused by it are considered to be turning points in the history of the developing science of [[astrobiology]].&lt;ref name=disbelief/&gt;

In September 2005, Vicky Hamilton of the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] presented an analysis of the origin of ALH84001 using data from the [[Mars Global Surveyor]] and [[Mars Odyssey]] spacecraft orbiting Mars. According to the analysis, [[Eos Chasma]] in the [[Valles Marineris]] canyon appears to be the source of the meteorite.&lt;ref name="location"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn8004|title=Birthplace of famous Mars meteorite pinpointed|work=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=March 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis was not conclusive, in part because it was limited to areas of Mars not obscured by dust.

The theory holds that ALH84001 was blasted off from the surface of Mars by a meteor impact about 17 million years ago&lt;ref name="impact"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Evidence for ancient Martian life|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/sci/fifthconf99/6142.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fell on Earth roughly 13,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lpi/meteorites/The_Meteorite.shtml |title=How could ALH84001 get from Mars to Earth? |work=Lunar and Planetary Institute |publisher=LPI |date=2014 |accessdate=2014-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These dates were established by a variety of [[radiometric dating]] techniques, including [[samarium–neodymium dating|samarium–neodymium]] (Sm–Nd), [[Rubidium–strontium dating|rubidium–strontium]] (Rb–Sr), [[Potassium–argon dating|potassium–argon]] (K–Ar), and [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon-14]].&lt;ref name="age1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nyquist|first=L.

ALH84001 is the only meteorite collected from such a time period.&lt;ref name=disbelief/&gt;

In October 2011 it was reported that isotopic analysis indicated that the carbonates in ALH84001 were precipitated at a temperature of 18&amp;nbsp;°C with water and carbon dioxide from the [[Martian atmosphere]]. The carbonate carbon and oxygen isotope ratios imply deposition of the carbonates from a gradually evaporating subsurface water body, probably a shallow aquifer meters or tens of meters below the surface.&lt;ref name="aqueous environment"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbonates in the Martian meteorite Allan Hills 84001 formed at 18 ± 4 °C in a near-surface aqueous environment|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/09/26/1109444108.abstract|publisher=[[PNAS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKay]] of [[NASA]] published in an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' claiming that the meteorite may contain evidence of traces of [[life on Mars (planet)|life from Mars]].&lt;ref name=disbelief&gt;{{cite web|title=After 10 years, few believe life on Mars|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2006-08-06-mars-life_x.htm|last=Crenson|first=Matt|publisher=Associated Press on USA Today|date=2006-08-06|accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="life"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKay|first=David S.|date= 1996|title=Search for Past Life on Mars: Possible Relic Biogenic Activity in Martian Meteorite ALH84001|journal=Science|pmid=8688069|volume=273|issue=5277|pages=924–930|doi=10.1126/science.273.5277.924|bibcode = 1996Sci...273..924M |displayauthors=2|last2=Gibson Jr.|first2=E.

The structures found on ALH84001 are {{Nowrap|20–100 [[nanometre]]s}} in diameter, similar in size to theoretical [[nanobacteria]], but smaller than any [[cellular life]] known at the time of their discovery. If the structures had been fossilized lifeforms, as was proposed by the so-called biogenic hypothesis of their formation, they would have been the first solid evidence of the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]], aside from the chance of their origin being terrestrial contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=McSween, H. Y.|title=Evidence for life in a martian meteorite?|journal=GSA Today|volume=7|issue=7|pages=1–7|date=1997|pmid=11541665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement of possible [[extraterrestrial life]] caused considerable controversy. When the discovery was announced, many immediately conjectured that the fossils were the first true evidence of extraterrestrial life—making headlines around the world, and even prompting the [[President of the United States]] [[Bill Clinton]] to make a formal televised announcement to mark the event.&lt;ref name="clinton"&gt;{{cite web|title=President Clinton Statement Regarding Mars Meteorite Discovery|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/clinton.html|last=Clinton|first=Bill|publisher=NASA|date=1996-08-07|accessdate=2006-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David S. McKay at NASA argued that likely microbial terrestrial contamination found in other Martian meteorites does not resemble the microscopic shapes in the ALH84001. In particular, the shapes within the ALH84001 look intergrown or embedded in the indigenous material, while likely contamination does not.&lt;ref name="jsc2009"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Origins of magnetite nanocrystals in Martian meteorite ALH84001 |journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta |date=2009 |last= Thomas-Keprta |first=K.

Golden.&lt;ref name="jsc2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/2004/J04-025.html |title=NASA – Press Release #J04-025 |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; David McKay says these results were obtained using unrealistically pure raw materials as a starting point,&lt;ref name=disbelief/&gt; and "will not explain many of the features described by us in ALH84001." According to McKay, a plausible inorganic model "must explain simultaneously all of the properties that we and others have suggested as possible biogenic properties of this meteorite."&lt;ref name="jsc2004"/&gt; The rest of the scientific community disagreed with McKay.&lt;ref name=disbelief/&gt;

In November 2009, a team of scientists at [[Johnson Space Center]], including McKay, argued that since their original paper was published, the biogenic hypothesis has been "further strengthened by the presence of abundant fossil-like structures in other Martian meteorites."{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} &lt;!-- &lt;ref name="jsc2009"/&gt; --&gt;However, the scientific consensus is that "morphology alone cannot be used unambiguously as a tool for primitive life detection."&lt;ref name=morphology&gt;{{cite journal | title = Morphological behavior of inorganic precipitation systems – Instruments, Methods, and Missions for Astrobiology II | journal = SPIE Proceedings | date = December 30, 1999 | first = Juan-Manuel Garcia-Ruiz | volume = Proc.

Features that have been interpreted as suggesting the presence of microfossils include:

* The structures resemble some modern terrestrial bacteria and their appendages. Though some are smaller than any present day Earth microbes, others are of the order of 100 - 200&amp;nbsp;nm in size, within the size limits of [[nanobacteria]] and some are up to 1 to 2 microns in diameter.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt; The smallest ones are too small to contain all the systems of modern life.&lt;ref name="disbelief" /&gt; 
* Some of the structures resemble colonies and biofilms.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt; However, there are many instances of morphologies that suggested life and were later shown to be due to inorganic processes.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt;
* The meteorite contains [[magnetite]] crystals of the unusual rectangular prism type, and organized into domains all about the same size, indistinguishable from magnetite produced biologically on Earth and not matching any known nonbiological magnetite that forms naturally on Earth.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt; The magnetite is embedded in the carbonate. If found on Earth it would be a very strong biosignature. However, in 2001, scientists were able to explain and produce carbonate globules containing similar magnetite grains through an inorganic process simulating conditions ALH84001 experienced on Mars.&lt;ref name="disbelief" /&gt;
* It contains [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs) concentrated in the regions containing the carbonate globules, and these have been shown to be indigenous. Other organics such as amino acids do not follow this pattern and are probably due to Antarctic contamination. However PAHs are also found in asteroids, comets and meteorites, and in deep space, all in the absence of life.&lt;ref name="disbelief"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/ast.2016.1533 Habitability on Early Mars and the Search for Biosignatures with the ExoMars Rover].

===RNA world hypothesis===
{{main|RNA world hypothesis}}
A workshop on the limitations of size of microbes in 1999 found that though modern nanobacteria can't be smaller in volume than the interior of a sphere of diameter 250 ± 50&amp;nbsp;nm, primitive microorganisms based on a single-polymer system could be. They cite the example of RNA based life, with [[ribozymes]] (catalytic RNA) taking the place of the much larger [[ribosomes]] as enzymes for cell replication. The cells also wouldn't have proteins and would have no need to translate DNA to mRNA. The result could be cells as small as a sphere 50&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter. These [[RNA World]] cells are one of the suggestions made to bridge the gap between abiotic chemistry and modern cells.

The main suggestions they gave that could explain the small size are that

* Cells could shrink after death
* The fossils could be remains of fragments of larger organisms
* They could be pathogens or symbiotes which depend on a host
* They could live in consortia of smaller cells unable to survive independently on their own
* They could be based on biological systems different from the ones we understand (such as the RNA World cells).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Size Limits of Very Small Microorganisms: Proceedings of a Workshop (1999)|date=1999|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/9638/chapter/2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RNA world hypothesis is still under consideration, with chemist [[Steven A. Benner]] and physicist [[Paul Davies]] supporting it in a chapter of the book "Frontiers of Astrobiology" published in 2012 by the Cambridge University Press, in the chapter "Towards a Theory of Life"&lt;ref name="Benner"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven a.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2292">The '''American Bryological and Lichenological Society''' is an organization devoted to the scientific study of all aspects of the [[biology]] of [[bryophytes]] and [[lichen]]-forming [[fungi]] and is one of the nation's oldest botanical organizations. It was originally known as the '''Sullivant Moss Society''', named after [[William Starling Sullivant]]. The Society publishes a quarterly journal distributed worldwide, ''[[The Bryologist]]'', which includes articles on all aspects of the biology of [[mosses]], [[hornworts]], [[liverworts]] and lichens.

==History==
The Society was founded in 1898, and was first known as the Sullivant Moss Chapter. It was founded by [[Elizabeth Gertrude Britton]] and [[Abel Joel Grout]].  [[Carolyn Wilson Harris]] was vice president of the Society during 1904–1905 and charge of the Lichen Department from 1901–1905.

[[Annie Morrill Smith]] was a central figure in the organization in the early years, contributing much time, energy, and money. She was editor or associate editor of ''[[The Bryologist]]'' for ten years, and changed the name to the Sullivant Moss ''Society''.

[[Image:Male anatomy en.svg|right|thumb|The male sexual organs]]

'''Anal masturbation''' is an [[masturbation|erotic stimulation]] focusing on the [[anus]] and [[rectum]]. For humans, common methods of anal masturbation include manual stimulation of the anal opening, and the insertion of an object or objects such as fingers, tongue, phallic-shaped items, water play, or sex toys such as [[anal beads]], [[butt plug]]s, [[dildo]]s, [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]], or specially designed [[Prostate massage#Equipment|prostate massagers]].

==Method==
Pleasure can be derived from anal masturbation due to the [[nerve ending]]s in the anal and rectal areas.&lt;ref name="Answer"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kkts3AX9QVAC&amp;pg=PA108|title=The Orgasm Answer Guide|author=Barry R.

Anal masturbation can be especially pleasurable for those with a functioning prostate because it often stimulates the area, which also contains sensitive nerve endings.&lt;ref name="Answer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Male hot spot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2246.html|title=The male hot spot — Massaging the prostate|date=March 28, 2008|publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329122100/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2246.html|archivedate=29 March 2010|deadurl=yes|accessdate=April 21, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some men find the quality of their orgasm to be significantly enhanced by the use of a butt plug or other anally inserted item during sexual activity.

[[Enema]]s or anal [[douche]]s can, for hygienic reasons, be taken prior to anal masturbation if desired, but they can also be a form of anal masturbation themselves: see [[klismaphilia]].

Commonly inserted objects include butt plugs, anal beads, dildos, vibrators and fingers.

==Safety==
Insertion of foreign objects into the anus is not without dangers. This area is fragile, the intestinal walls do not feel pain and for objects pushed too far, surgery may be necessary for removal (even without injury). Unsafe anal masturbation methods cause harm and a potential trip to the hospital emergency room. However, anal masturbation can be carried out in greater safety by ensuring that the bowel is emptied before beginning, the anus and rectum are sufficiently lubricated and relaxed throughout, and the inserted object is not of too great a size.

===Objects===
[[Image:Buttplug.png|upright|thumb|Butt plugs often have a flared base and are free of seams.]]

Some anal stimulators are purposely ribbed or have a wave pattern in order to enhance pleasure and simulate intercourse. Stimulating the rectum with a rough-edged object or a finger (for the purposes of medically stimulating a bowel movement or other reasons) may lead to rectum wall tearing, especially if the fingernail is left untrimmed. Vegetables have rough edges and most have [[microorganism]]s on the surface, and thus could lead to infection if not sanitized before use.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Risks associated with bleeding===
Minor injuries that cause some bleeding to the rectum pose measurable risk, and often need treatment. Injury can be contained by cessation of anal stimulation at any sign of injury, bleeding, or pain. While minor bleeding may stop of its own accord, individuals with serious injury, clotting problems, or other medical factors could face serious risk and require medical attention.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Prolonged or heavy bleeding can indicate a life-threatening situation, as the intestinal wall can be damaged, leading to internal injury of the [[peritoneal cavity]] and [[peritonitis]], which can be fatal. Carefully using implements without sharp edges or rough surfaces carries a lower risk of damage to the intestinal wall.

The treatment for persistent or heavy bleeding will require a visit to an emergency room for a [[sigmoidoscopy]] and [[cauterization]] in order to prevent further loss of blood. Apart from the volume of blood that is lost into the rectum, other easily observable indications that medical intervention is urgently needed as a result of blood loss are an elevated heart rate, a general feeling of faintness or weakness, and a loss of pleasure from the act.

===Rectal foreign bodies===
{{see also|Rectal foreign body}}
Butt plugs normally have a flared base to prevent complete insertion and should be carefully sanitized before and after use. Sex toys, including objects for rectal insertion, should not be shared in order to minimize the risk of disease. Objects such as lightbulbs or anything breakable such as glass or wax candles cannot safely be used in anal masturbation, as they may break or shatter, causing highly dangerous medical situations.

Some objects can become lodged above the lower colon and could be seriously difficult to remove. Such foreign bodies should not be allowed to remain in place. Medical help should be sought if the object does not emerge on its own. Immediate assistance is recommended if the object is not a proper rectal toy, like a plug or something soft, for example if it is either too hard, too large, has projections, slightly sharp edges, or if any trace of injury happens (bleeding, pain, cramps). Small objects with dimensions similar to small stools are less likely to become lodged than medium-sized or large objects as they can usually be expelled by forcing a bowel movement. It is always safest if a graspable part of the object remains outside the body.

==Hygiene==
The biological function of the anus is to expel [[intestinal gas]] and [[feces]] from the body; therefore, when engaging in anal masturbation, hygiene is important. One may wish to cover butt plugs or other objects with a [[condom]] before insertion and then dispose of the condom afterwards. To minimize the potential transfer of germs between sexual partners, there are practices of [[safe sex]] recommended by healthcare professionals. Oral or vaginal infection may occur similarly to penile [[Ass to mouth|anus-to-mouth]] or [[anilingus]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Morin, Jack | title = Anal Pleasure and Health | edition = 3rd | publisher = Down There Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-940208-20-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzRpRcMQjkYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=June 2009}}

A '''Bachelor of Science in Information Technology''', (abbreviated '''BSIT''' or '''B.Sc IT'''), is a [[Bachelor's degree]] awarded for an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] course or program in the [[Information technology]] field. The degree is normally required in order to work in the Information technology industry. 
 
A Bachelor of Science in Information Technology degree program typically takes three to four years depending on the country. This degree is primarily focused on subjects such as software, databases, and networking. In general, computer science degrees tend to focus on the mathematical and theoretical foundations of computing rather than emphasizing specific technologies. The degree is a [[Bachelor of Science|Bachelor of Science degree]] with institutions conferring degrees in the fields of information technology and related fields. This degree is awarded for completing a program of study in the field of [[software development]], [[software testing]], [[software engineering]], [[web design]], [[databases]], [[Computer programming|programming]], [[computer networking]] and [[computer systems]].

Graduates with an information technology background are able to perform technology tasks relating to the processing, storing, and communication of information between computers, mobile phones, and other electronic devices. Information technology as a field emphasizes the secure management of large amounts of variable information and its accessibility via a wide variety of systems both local and worldwide.&lt;ref name="bls.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Computer-and-Information-Technology/Network-and-computer-systems-administrators.htm|title = Network and Computer Systems Administrators|date = 2012-03-29|accessdate = 2013-12-01|website = Occupational Outlook Handbook|publisher = United States Bureau of Labor Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skills taught==
Generally, software and information technology companies look for people who have strong programming skills, system analysis, and software testing skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm|title = Computer and Inform}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many colleges teach practical skills that are crucial to becoming a software developer. As logical reasoning and critical thinking are important in becoming a software professional, this degree encompasses the complete process of software development from software design and development to final testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://view.fdu.edu/default.aspx?id=3815 Bachelor of Science in Information Technology :: Fairleigh Dickinson University]. View.fdu.edu (2006-05-08). Retrieved on 2013-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who complete their undergraduate education in [[software engineering]] at a satisfactory level often pursue graduate studies such as a [[Master of Science in Information Technology]] (M.Sc IT) and sometimes continuing onto a doctoral program and earning a [[doctorate]] such as a [[Doctor of Information Technology]] (DIT).

'''Biosafety''' is the prevention of large-scale loss of [[biological integrity]], focusing both on [[ecology]] and [[human health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biosafety and the environment: An introduction to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/press/presskits/bs/cpbs-unep-cbd-en.pdf|series=GE.03-01836/E |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These prevention mechanisms include conduction of regular reviews of the biosafety in laboratory settings, as well as strict guidelines to follow. Biosafety is used to protect from harmful incidents. Many laboratories handling biohazards employ an ongoing risk management assessment and enforcement process for biosafety.  Failures to follow such protocols can lead to increased risk of exposure to biohazards or pathogens. [[Human error]] and poor technique contribute to unnecessary exposure and compromise the best safeguards set into place for protection.

The international [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]] deals primarily with the agricultural definition but many advocacy groups seek to expand it to include post-genetic threats: new molecules, artificial life forms, and even robots which may compete directly in the natural food chain.

Biosafety in agriculture, chemistry, medicine, exobiology and beyond will likely require the application of the [[precautionary principle]], and a new definition focused on the biological nature of the threatened organism rather than the nature of the threat.

When [[biological warfare]] or new, currently hypothetical, threats (i.e., robots, new artificial bacteria) are considered, biosafety precautions are generally not sufficient. (link to incident report, i.e. such as problems with CDC research labs in 2014)The new field of [[biosecurity]] addresses these complex threats.

[[Biosafety level]] refers to the stringency of [[biocontainment]] precautions deemed necessary by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) for laboratory work with infectious materials.

Typically, institutions that experiment with or create potentially harmful biological material will have a committee or board of supervisors that is in charge of the institution's biosafety. They create and monitor the biosafety standards that must be met by labs in order to prevent the accidental release of potentially destructive biological material. (note that in the US, several groups are involved, and efforts are being made to improve processes for government run labs, but there is no unifying regulatory authority for all labs.

Biosafety is related to several fields:

* In [[ecology]] (referring to imported life forms from beyond [[ecoregion]] borders),
* In [[agriculture]] (reducing the risk of alien viral or [[transgenic]] genes, [[genetic engineering]] or prions such as BSE/"MadCow", reducing the risk of food bacterial contamination)
* In [[medicine]] (referring to organs or tissues from biological origin, or genetic therapy products, virus; levels of [[biocontainment|lab containment]] protocols measured as 1, 2, 3, 4 in rising order of danger),
* In [[chemistry]] (i.e., nitrates in water, PCB levels affecting fertility)
* In [[exobiology]] (i.e., NASA's policy for containing alien microbes that may exist on space samples. See [[planetary protection]] and [[interplanetary contamination]]), and
* In [[synthetic biology]] (referring to the risks associated with this type of lab practice)

==In synthetic biology==
High-security facilities are necessary when working with [[synthetic biology]] as there are possibilities of [[bioterrorism]] acts or release of harmful chemicals and or organisms into the environment. A complete understanding of experimental risks associated with synthetic biology is helping to enforce the knowledge and effectiveness of biosafety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Serrano|first=Luis|title=Molecular Systems Biology|url=http://www.nature.com/msb/journal/v3/n1/full/msb4100202.html|publisher=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the potential future creation of man-made unicellular organisms, some are beginning to consider the effect that these organisms will have on biomass already present. Scientists estimate that within the next few decades, organism design will be sophisticated enough to accomplish tasks such as creating biofuels and lowering the levels of harmful substances in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=James|title=Synthetic Biology: Bits and pieces come to life|journal=Nature|date=|volume=483|issue=7387|pages=S8–S10|doi=10.1038/483S8a|pmid=22378128|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7387_supp/full/483S8a.html|accessdate=12 April 2012|year=2012|bibcode=2012Natur.483S...8C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientist that favor the development of synthetic biology claim that the use of biosafety mechanisms such as suicide genes and nutrient dependencies will ensure the organisms cannot survive outside of the lab setting in which they were originally created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Self-Replicating Synthetic Bacterial Cell|url=http://www.jcvi.org/cms/research/projects/first-self-replicating-synthetic-bacterial-cell/faq/#q8|publisher=J. Craig Venter Institute|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizations like the [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]] argue that regulations should control the creation of organisms that could potentially harm existing life. They also argue that the development of these organisms will simply shift the consumption of petroleum to the utilization of biomass in order to create energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silvia Ribeiro|first=Ribeiro|title=News Release: Biofuels, Bioenergy and Biochar: False Solutions Lead to Land-Grabbing|url=http://www.etcgroup.org/en/node/5243|accessdate=12 April 2012|date=December 3, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501211305/http://www.etcgroup.org/en/node/5243|archivedate=1 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organisms can harm existing life by affecting the prey/predator food chain, reproduction between species, as well as competition against other species (species at risk, or act as an invasive species).
[[Synthetic vaccine]]s are now being produced in the lab. These have caused a lot of excitement in the [[pharmaceutical industry]] as they will be cheaper to produce, allow quicker production, as well enhance the knowledge of [[virology]] and [[immunology]].

==In medicine, healthcare settings and laboratories==
{{see also|Biosafety level}}

Biosafety, in medicine and health care settings, specifically refers to proper handling of organs or tissues from biological origin, or genetic therapy products, viruses with respect to the environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of BIOSAFETY|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/biosafety|accessdate=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure the safety of health care workers, researchers, lab staff, patients, and the general public. Laboratories are assigned a biosafety level numbered 1 through 4 based on their potential biohazard risk level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biosafety.be/RA/Class/ClassINT.html#UNITED_STATES|accessdate=October 9, 2016|title=International classification schemes for micro-organisms based on their biological risks # UNITED STATES|date=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The employing authority, through the laboratory director, is responsible for ensuring that there is adequate surveillance of the health of laboratory personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laboratory Biosafety Manual - Third Edition|url=http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/biosafety/en/Biosafety7.pdf|website=World Health Organization|publisher=WHO|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of such surveillance is to monitor for occupationally acquired diseases.&lt;ref name=CDCMan/&gt; The World Health Organization attributes human error and poor technique&lt;ref name=CDCMan/&gt; as the primary cause of mishandling of biohazardous materials.

Biosafety is becoming also a global concern and require multilevel resources and international collaboration to monitor, prevent and correct accidents from unintended and malicious release and also to prevent that bioterrorists get their hands-on biologics sample to create biologic weapons of mass destruction.  Even people outside of the health sector needs to be involved as in the case of the Ebola outbreak the impact that it had on businesses and travel required that private sectors, international banks together pledged more than $2 billion to combat the epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/t/us/2015/237560.htm|title=Biosecurity in the Time of Ebola|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bureau of international Security and nonproliferation (ISN) is responsible for managing a broad range of U.S. nonproliferation policies, programs, agreements, and initiatives, and biological weapon is one their concerns
Biosafety has its risks and benefits. All stakeholders must try to find a balance between cost-effectiveness of safety measures and use evidence-based safety practices and recommendations, measure the outcomes and consistently reevaluate the potential benefits that biosafety represents for human health.
Biosafety level designations are based on a composite of the design features, construction, containment facilities, equipment, practices and operational procedures required for working with agents from the various risk groups.&lt;ref name=CDCMan/&gt;

Classification of biohazardous materials is subjective and the risk assessment is determined by the individuals most familiar with the specific characteristics of the organism.&lt;ref name=CDCMan/&gt; There are several factors taken into account when assessing an organism and the classification process.

*Risk Group 1: (no or low individual and community risk) A [[microorganism]] that is unlikely to cause human or animal disease.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biosafety.be/RA/Class/ClassINT.html#UNITED_STATES|title=International Classification Systems for Micro-organisms|first=|last=SBB©2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Risk Group 2 : (moderate individual risk, low community risk) A [[pathogen]] that can cause human or animal disease but is unlikely to be a serious hazard to laboratory workers, the community, livestock or the environment. Laboratory exposures may cause serious infection, but effective treatment and preventive measures are available and the risk of spread of infection is limited.&lt;ref name=CDCMan&gt;{{cite web|title=Laboratory Biosafety Manual|url=http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/biosafety/en/Biosafety7.pdf|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Risk Group 3 : (high individual risk, low community risk) A pathogen that usually causes serious human or animal disease but does not ordinarily spread from one infected individual to another. Effective treatment and preventive measures are available.&lt;ref name=CDCMan/&gt;
*Risk Group 4 : (high individual and community risk) A pathogen that usually causes serious human or animal disease and that can be readily transmitted from one individual to another, directly or indirectly. Effective treatment and preventive measures are not usually available.&lt;ref name=CDCMan/&gt;

See World Health Organization Biosafety Laboratory Guidelines: [http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/biosafety/WHO_CDS_CSR_LYO_2004_11/en/ World Health Organization Biosafety Laboratory Guildlines]

Investigations have shown that there are hundreds of unreported biosafety accidents, with laboratories self-policing the handling of biohazardous materials and lack of reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Young A|author2=Penzenstadler N, TODAY|title= Inside America's secretive biolabs|work=USA Today|date=May 28, 2015|url=https://www.usatoday.com/longform/news/2015/05/28/biolabs-pathogens-location-incidents/26587505/|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor record keeping, improper disposal, and mishandling biohazardous materials result in increased risks of biochemical contamination for both the public and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House issues report on improving biosafety at federal labs|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-whitehouse-biosafety-idUSKCN0SN34F20151029|date=October 29, 2015|accessdate=September 3, 2016|first=Julie|last=Steenhuysen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the precautions taken during the handling process of biohazardous materials, the World Health Organization recommends:
Staff training should always include information on safe methods for highly hazardous procedures that are commonly encountered by all laboratory personnel and which involve:&lt;ref name=CDCMan/&gt;
#Inhalation risks (i.e. aerosol production) when using loops, streaking agar plates,
#pipetting, making smears, opening cultures, taking blood/serum samples, centrifuging, etc.
#Ingestion risks when handling specimens, smears and cultures
#Risks of [[percutaneous]] exposures when using syringes and needles
#Bites and scratches when handling animals
#Handling of blood and other potentially hazardous pathological materials
#Decontamination and disposal of infectious material.

==Policy and practice in the United States==

===Legal information===
In June 2009, the Trans-Federal Task Force On Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight recommended the formation of an agency to coordinate high safety risk level labs (3 and 4), and voluntary, non-punitive measures for incident reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/is/br/bbotaskforce/biosafety-FINAL-REPORT-092009.pdf |title=Report of the Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight  |date=July 2009  |publisher=ars.usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear as to what changes may or may not have been implemented following their recommendations.

====United States Code of Federal Regulations====

The United States [[Code of Federal Regulations]] is the [[codification (law)]], or collection of laws specific to a specific to a [[jurisdiction]] that represent broad areas subject to federal regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDsys - Browse Code of Federal Regulations (Annual Edition)|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collectionCfr.action?collectionCode=CFR|accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations]] addresses laws concerning Public Health issues including biosafety which can be found under the citation 42 CFR 73 to 42 CFR 73.21 by accessing the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) website.&lt;ref name=E-CFR&gt;{{cite web|title=E-CFR: TITLE 42—Public Health. Vol TITLE 42—Public Health|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=868d2d34fe582976da6e893468fa7eb6&amp;pitd=20150101&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title42/42cfr73_main_02.tpl|accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:International Biohazard Warning Symbol.svg|thumb|International Biohazard Warning Symbol]]
Title 42 Section 73 of the CFR addresses specific aspects of biosafety including [[Occupational safety and health]], transportation of biohazardous materials and safety plans for laboratories using potential biohazards. While [[biocontainment]], as defined in the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories&lt;ref name=CDCbiosafety&gt;{{cite web|title=Biosafety Publications and Forms|publisher=CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/index.htm|accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Primary Containment for Biohazards: Selection, Installation and Use of Biosafety Cabinets&lt;ref name=CDCbiosafety /&gt; manuals available at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] website much of the design, implementation and monitoring of protocols are left up to state and local authorities.&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt;
 
The United States CFR states  "An individual or entity required to register [as a user of biological agents] must develop and implement a written biosafety plan that is commensurate with the risk of the select agent or toxin"&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt; which is followed by 3 recommended sources for laboratory reference.

#The CDC/NIH publication, "Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories."&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt;
#The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations in 29 CFR parts 1910.1200 and 1910.1450.&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt;
#The "NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules," (NIH Guidelines).&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt;

While clearly the needs of [[biocontainment]] and biosafety measures vary across government, academic and private industry laboratories, [[biological agents]] pose similar risks independent of their locale.&lt;ref name=TIAN2014&gt;Tian D, Zheng T. Comparison and Analysis of Biological Agent Category Lists Based On Biosafety and Biodefense. PLoS One. 2014;9(6). {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0101163}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Laws relating to biosafety are not easily accessible and there are few federal regulations that are readily available for a potential trainee to reference outside of the publications recommended in 42 CFR 73.12.&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt;&lt;ref name=CDCbiosafety /&gt; Therefore, training is the responsibility of lab employers&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt; and is not consistent across various laboratory types thereby increasing the risk of accidental release of [[biological hazards]] that pose serious health threats to the humans, animals and the [[ecosystem]] as a whole.

====Agency guidance====

Many government agencies have made guidelines and recommendations in an effort to increase biosafety measures across laboratories in the United States.  Agencies involved in producing policies surrounding biosafety within a hospital, pharmacy or clinical research laboratory include: the CDC, [[FDA]], [[USDA]], [[DHHS]], DoT, [[EPA]] and potentially other local organizations including public health departments.  The federal government does set some standards and recommendations for States to meet their standards, most of which fall under the [[Occupational Health and Safety Act]] of 1970.&lt;ref name="osha.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/osp/|title=Directorate of Cooperative and State Programs - State Plans|publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; but currently, there is no single federal regulating agency directly responsible for ensuring the safety of biohazardous handling, storage, identification, clean-up and disposal.  In addition to the CDC, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] has some of the most accessible information on ecological impacts of biohazards, how to handle spills, reporting guidelines and proper disposal of agents dangerous to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/regulatory-information-topic/regulatory-information-topic-waste#hazardous|title=Regulatory Information by Topic: Waste|first=US|last=EPA, OEI, OIAA, IAD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these agencies have their own manuals and guidance documents relating to training and certain aspects of biosafety directly tied to their agency's scope, including transportation, storage and handling of blood borne pathogens. (OSHA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha3186.pdf |title=Model Plans and Programs for the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens and Hazard Communications Standards |year=2003 |publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IATA]]).  The American Biological Safety Association (ABSA) has a list of such agencies and links to their websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.absa.org/resbslinks.html|title=ABSA - Biosafety Links|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with links to publications and guidance documents to assist in risk assessment, lab design and adherence to laboratory exposure control plans. Many of these agencies were members of the 2009 Task Force on BioSafety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/boards/biosafetytaskforce/Pages/taskforcemembership.aspx|title=BioSafety Task Force Membership - PHE|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103173822/https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/boards/biosafetytaskforce/Pages/taskforcemembership.aspx|archive-date=2017-01-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a formation of a [[Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense]], but this is more concernend with national defense programs and biosecurity.

Ultimately states and local governments, as well as private industry labs, are left to make the final determinants for their own biosafety programs, which vary widely in scope and enforcement across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triumvirate.com/State-by-state-Biosafety-Regulations|title=State-by-state Biosafety Regulations  - Resource Page|first=Triumvirate|last=Environmental|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all state programs address biosafety from all necessary perspectives, which should not just include personal safety, but also emphasize an full understanding among laboratory personnel of quality control and assurance, exposure potential impacts on the environment, and general public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHA3404laboratory-safety-guidance.pdf |title=Laboratory Safety Guidance |year=2011 |publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State occupational safety plans are often focused on transportation, disposal, and risk assessment, allowing caveats for safety audits, but ultimately leaves the training in the hands of the employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/migrate/uploads/AAAS-Biosafety-report.pdf |title=Biological Safety Training Programs as a Component of Personnel Reliability  |type=Workshop Report  |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science | author1=Kavita Marfatia Berger|author2=Kathryn A. Luke|author3=Mark S. Frankel|author4=Jennifer L. Sta.Ana |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  22 states have approved Occupational Safety plans by OSHA that are audited annually for effectiveness.&lt;ref name="osha.gov"/&gt; These plans apply to private and public sector workers, and not necessarily state/ government workers, and not all specifically have a comprehensive program for all aspects of biohazard management from start to finish.  Sometimes biohazard management plans are limited only to workers in transportation specific job titles.  The enforcement and training on such regulations can vary from lab to lab based on the State's plans for occupational health and safety.  With the exception of DoD lab personnel, CDC lab personnel, First responders, and DoT employees, enforcement of training is inconsistent, and while training is required to be done, specifics on the breadth and frequency of refresher training does not seem consistent from state to state; penalties may never be assessed without larger regulating bodies being aware of non-compliance, and enforcement is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.councilforresponsiblegenetics.org/pageDocuments/T6CQ5HCITM.pdf |title=Biological Laboratories: Risks and Regulations |last=Buyon |first=Lucas  |publisher=Council for Responsible Genetics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Medical waste management in the United States ====
{{see also|Medical Waste Tracking Act}}
[[Medical waste]] management was identified as an issue in the 1980s; with the [[Medical Waste Tracking Act]] of 1988&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulated Biohazard Waste Regulations|url=http://biohazardwasteregulations.com/|website=Biohazard Waste Regulations|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the new standard in biohazard [[waste disposal]].

Although the Federal Government, EPA &amp; DOT provide some oversight of regulated medical waste storage, transportation, and disposal the majority of biohazard medical waste is regulated at the state level.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Each state is responsible for regulation and management of their own bioharzardous waste with each state varying in their regulatory process. Record keeping of biohazardous waste also varies between states.

Medical healthcare centers, hospitals veterinary clinics, clinical laboratories and other facilities generate over one million tons of waste each year.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Although the majority of this waste is as harmless as common household waste, as much as 15 percent of this waste poses a potential infection hazard, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Medical waste is required to be rendered non-infectious before it can be disposed of.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; There are several different methods to treat and dispose of biohazardous waste. In the United States, the 
primary methods for treatment and disposal of biohazard, medical and sharps waste may include:&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
* [[Incineration]]
* Microwave
* [[Autoclaves]]
* Mechanical/Chemical Disinfection
*[[Irradiation]]

Different forms of biohazardous wasted required different treatments for their proper waste management. This is determined largely be each states regulations. Currently, there are several contracted companies that focus on medical, sharps and biological hazard disposal. Stericycle is one of the leaders in medical waste and pharmaceutical disposal in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stericycle.com/about-us|title=About - Stericycle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incidents of non-compliance and reform efforts===

The United States Government has made it clear that biosafety is to be taken very seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/biosafety-and-biosecurity-united-states|title=Biosafety and Biosecurity in the United States - Homeland Security|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, incidents with Anthrax and Ebola pathogens in CDC laboratories (&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/s0204-ebola-lab.html|title=CDC Press Releases|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/news-multimedia/lab-incident/|title=CDC Lab Incident: Anthrax, June 2014 - Anthrax - CDC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), prompted the CDC director [[Tom Frieden]] to issue a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] for research with these types of [[select agent]]s.  An investigation concluded that there was a lack of adherence to safety protocols and "inadequate safeguards" in place.  This indicated a lack of proper training or reinforcement of training and supervision on regular basis for lab personnel.

Following these incidents, the CDC established an ''External Laboratory Safety Workgroup'' (ELSW),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/about/lab-safety/laboratory-safety-workgroup/workgroup.html|title=Laboratory Safety at CDC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggestions have been made to reform effectiveness of the Federal Select Agent Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selectagents.gov/|title=Federal Select Agent Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White house issued a report on national biosafety priorities in 2015, outlining next steps for a national biosafety and security program, and addressed biological safety needs for health research, national defense, and public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/10-2015_biosafety_and_biosecurity_memo.pdf |title=Biosafety and biosecurity memo |date=October 29, 2015 |publisher=www.whitehouse.gov |access-date=2016-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120141923/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/10-2015_biosafety_and_biosecurity_memo.pdf |archive-date=2017-01-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) had a presentation at their annual meeting focused on improving biosafety culture.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aphl.org/conferences/proceedings/Documents/2016_Annual_Meeting/23Monroe{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This same year, The UPMC Center for Health Security issued a case study report including reviews of ten different nations' current biosafety regulations, including the United States.  Their goal was to "provide a foundation for identifying national‐level biosafety norms and enable initial assessment of biosafety priorities necessary for developing effective national biosafety regulation and oversight."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.upmchealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2016/Combined%20Biosafety%20Case%20Studies%20final%20draft%20062116.pdf |title=NATIONAL BIOSAFETY SYSTEM |author1=Gigi Kwik Gronvall |author2=Matthew P Shearer |author3=Hannah Collins |date=July 2016 |publisher=UPMC Center for Health Security |access-date=2016-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109085425/http://www.upmchealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2016/Combined%20Biosafety%20Case%20Studies%20final%20draft%20062116.pdf |archive-date=2016-11-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bouldnor Cliff''' is a submerged prehistoric settlement site in the [[Solent]]. The site dates from the [[Mesolithic]] era and is in approximately {{convert|11|m|yd|0}} of water just offshore of the village of [[Bouldnor]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] in the United Kingdom. The preservation of organic materials from this era that do not normally survive on dry land has made Bouldnor important to the understanding of Mesolithic Britain, and the BBC Radio 4's Making History programme described it "probably Europe's most important Mesolithic site" albeit concealed under water.

The site was first discovered by divers from the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology (now the [[Maritime Archaeology Trust]]) in 1999, when a lobster was observed discarding worked flint tools from its burrow on the seabed.&lt;ref name=BBCAtlantis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British Archaeology, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, several years of fieldwork have revealed that Bouldnor was a settlement site about 8,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, at a time when lower sea levels meant that the Solent was just a river valley. The work done so far has already revealed that the technology of Mesolithic settlers was probably 2,000&amp;nbsp;years ahead of what had previously been believed.&lt;ref name=CP&gt;{{Citation | title = Diving into the Past| newspaper =Isle of Wight County Press | pages =14 | date=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site formation==
Investigations suggest that during the [[Mesolithic]] era, between 8000 and 4000&amp;nbsp;BC, the western Solent was a sheltered river basin, rich in woodland and fed by a river at [[Lymington]] and drained by the [[Western Yar]] at [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight|Freshwater]].&lt;ref name =M10&gt;Momber, Tomalin, Scaife, Satchell &amp; Gillespie, preface p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; As sea levels rose, the Solent eventually flooded and the settlement area was swamped. The rising waters deposited silt and mud onto the original land surface, covering and preserving it.&lt;ref name= BBCAtlantis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/6928293.stm|title=Fight on to save Stone Age Atlantis|publisher=BBC| date=8 August 2007 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
Fishermen had reported recovering stone tools from the seabed of the Solent since the 1960s, but it was not until 1987 that the submerged remains of an ancient forest were discovered at Bouldnor. Later radiocarbon dating of pollen revealed this to be approximately 8,000&amp;nbsp;years old.&lt;ref name=BA32&gt;British Archaeology, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, regular dives revealed a submerged cliff east of [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight|Yarmouth]] with large quantities of peat that dated to a similar period.&lt;ref name=BA32/&gt;

The [[Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology]] began mapping the cliff face and selected four main sites of interest (named BC 1–4). It was while diving in {{convert|11|m|yd|0}} of water on BC 2 in 1999, that divers noticed a burrowing lobster discarding [[stone tool|worked flints]] from its burrow. The lobster had burrowed through thick mud deposits that had formed since the Solent flooded, and into the original surface of the cliff when the Solent was dry.&lt;ref name=BA32/&gt;

Since 1999, divers have excavated at Bouldnor every year. Further discoveries were made at BC 2 and BC 4, and a later a new site was discovered nearby (BC 5).&lt;ref name=BA33&gt;British Archaeology, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The dangerous diving conditions in the fast flowing waters of the Solent make archaeological investigation particularly difficult and archaeologists have used several new techniques to make analysis of the sea bed easier. This has included 'box sampling' – collecting large areas of sea bed in metal tins to raise them to the surface and more thoroughly excavate their contents on dry land.&lt;ref name=CP/&gt;

==Findings==
Archaeologists have discovered large quantities of burnt flints, mounds of timbers and pits dug into the ground. Wood from this era does not normally preserve well in land environments, so the quantity of wood found at Bouldnor makes the site of international importance.&lt;ref name=BA34&gt;British Archaeology, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a large mound of worked timbers at BC 5, archaeologists discovered large areas of burnt clay, burnt flint and charcoal, which has been interpreted as the floor of a living space.&lt;ref name=BA34/&gt; Other timbers show signs of having been extensively worked on. Some split oak suggests that particularly large structures, or possibly boats, were being constructed at the site.&lt;ref name=BA34/&gt; Another timber shows signs of having been fashioned as a type of [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|conduit]], which is not something that has ever been seen in Mesolithic archaeology before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode| title = Making History | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b010xzzp | credits =  | network = BBC | station = Radio 4 | location = Southampton| airdate = 10 May 2011 | time = 3pm – 3.30pm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the worked timbers indicate technological skills that had previously only been associated with the Neolithic era, 2000&amp;nbsp;years later than Bouldnor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimearchaeologytrust.org/bouldnor |title=Bouldnor Cliff|publisher=Maritime Archaeology Trust|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnt hazelnuts and oak charcoal have also been found at BC 5.&lt;ref name=BA33/&gt; Like the wood, these types of organic material do not normally survive well in dry, land based, environments.&lt;ref name=BBCAtlantis/&gt; A pit dug into the clay at BC 5 had been filled with burnt clay nodules, charcoal and burnt stones, which had been covered with a large piece of wood. Examining the pit walls revealed that the pit had probably been filled with hot stones on several occasions.&lt;ref name=BA34/&gt; Other [[trench]]es have revealed chipped wood flakes, flint knapping flakes and even wound fibres that appear to have been used as string.&lt;ref&gt;Momber, Tomalin, Scaife, Satchell &amp; Gillespie, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the finds suggest evidence of small scale industry as well as settlement.&lt;ref name=M10/&gt;

The work done at Bouldnor is exhibited in the Maritime Archaeology Trust's [[Sunken Secrets]] exhibition at [[Fort Victoria (Isle of Wight)|Fort Victoria]] on the Isle of Wight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunkensecrets.hwtma.org.uk/currentexhibitions|title=Sunken Secrets – Current Exhibitions|accessdate=7 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427105202/http://sunkensecrets.hwtma.org.uk/currentexhibitions#|archive-date=27 April 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International trade===
Research published in 2015 has identified wheat DNA at the site. As this wheat is of a type not native to Britain, it suggests the possibility of trade with Europe much earlier than had previously been supposed by archaeologists.&lt;ref name="Balter 2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balter|first1=Michael|title=DNA recovered from underwater British site may rewrite history of farming in Europe.|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/archaeology/2015/02/dna-recovered-underwater-british-site-may-rewrite-history-farming-europe?intcmp=highwire|publisher=Science|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim was questioned and it was suggested that the wheat DNA was too pristine and probably represents contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ancient DNA dispute raises questions about wheat trade in prehistoric Britain|url = http://www.nature.com/news/ancient-dna-dispute-raises-questions-about-wheat-trade-in-prehistoric-britain-1.18702|website = Nature News &amp; Comment|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Contesting the presence of wheat in the British Isles 8,000 years ago by assessing ancient DNA authenticity from low-coverage data|url = http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e10005|journal = eLife|date = 2015-11-03|issn = 2050-084X|pmc = 4629168|pmid = 26525598|pages = e10005|volume = 4|doi = 10.7554/eLife.10005|first = Clemens L.|last = Weiß|first2 = Michael|last2 = Dannemann|first3 = Kay|last3 = Prüfer|first4 = Hernán A.|last4 = Burbano}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the original authors published a response to this contested point.&lt;ref name="Kistler 2015"&gt;{{Cite biorxiv |title = Thermal age, cytosine deamination and the veracity of 8,000 year old wheat DNA from sediments|biorxiv = 032060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9568">[[File:Chemotaxis, Capillary Tube Assay.svg|thumb|The process of chemotaxis can be demonstrated using a capillary tube assay(shown above). The motile prokaryotes can sense chemicals in their environment and change their motility accordingly. When no chemicals are present, movement is completely random. When a repellent or attractant chemical is present, the motility changes; runs become longer and tumbles become less frequent so that the net movement towards or away from the chemical can be achieved. The net movement can be seen in the beaker, where the bacteria accumulate around the attractant, and away from the repellent.

'''Chemotaxis assays''' are experimental tools for evaluation of [[chemotactic]] ability of [[prokaryotic]] or [[eukaryotic]] cells.
A wide variety of techniques have been developed. Some techniques are [[qualitative property|qualitative]] - allowing an investigator to approximately determine a cell's chemotacic affinity for an analyte - while others are [[quantitative property|quantitative]], allowing a precise measurement of this affinity.

== Quality control ==
In general, the most important requisite is to calibrate the [[incubation time]] of the assay both to the model cell and the ligand to be evaluated. Too short incubation time results no cells in the sample, while too long time perturbs the concentration gradients and measures more [[chemokinesis|chemokinetic]] than [[chemotactic]] responses.

The most commonly used techniques are grouped into two main groups:

== Agar-plate techniques ==
[[Image:Chtx-asay-agar.PNG|thumb|right|450px|Chemotaxis assays with agar plates]]
This way of evaluation deals with [[agar-agar]] or [[gelatine]] containing semi-solid layers made prior to the experiment. Small wells are cut into the layer and filled with cells and the test substance. Cells can migrate towards the chemical gradient in the semi solid layer or under the layer as well. Some variations of the technique deal also with wells and parallel channels connected by a cut at the start of the experiment (PP-technique). Radial arrangement of PP-technique (3 or more channels) provides the possibility to compare chemotactic activity of different cell populations or study preference between ligands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Kőhidai L. | title= Method for determination of chemoattraction in Tetrahymena pyriformis.| journal= Curr Microbiol | year= 1995| volume= 30| pages= 251–3 | doi= 10.1007/BF00293642 | pmid= 7765899 | issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counting of cells: positive responder cells could be counted from the front of migrating cells, after staining or in native conditions in light microscope.

== Two-chamber techniques ==
[[Image:Chtx-twochamber-techn.PNG|thumb|right|450px|Chemotaxis chamber assays]]

=== Boyden chamber ===
Chambers isolated by filters are proper tools for accurate determination of chemotactic behavior. The pioneer type of these chambers was constructed by Boyden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Boyden, S.V. | title= The chemotactic effect of mixtures of antibody and antigen on polymorphonuclear leucocytes. | journal= J Exp Med | year= 1962| volume= 115 | issue= 3| pages=453–66 | doi= 10.1084/jem.115.3.453 | pmid= 13872176 | pmc= 2137509}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motile cells are placed into the upper chamber, while fluid containing the test substance is filled into the lower one. The size of the motile cells to be investigated determines the pore size of the filter; it is essential to choose a diameter which allows active transmigration. For modelling ''in vivo'' conditions, several protocols prefer coverage of filter with molecules of [[extracellular matrix]] ([[collagen]], [[elastin]] etc.) Efficiency of the measurements was increased by development of multiwell chambers (e.g. NeuroProbe), where 24, 96, 384 samples are evaluated in parallel. Advantage of this variant is that several parallels are assayed in identical conditions.

=== Bridge chambers ===
In another setting the chambers are connected side by side horizontally (Zigmond chamber)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| author=Zigmond S.H.
| title=Ability of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to orient in gradients of chemotactic factors
| journal=Journal of Cell Biology
| year=1977
| volume=75
| issue=2
| pages=606–616
| doi=10.1083/jcb.75.2.606
| citeseerx=10.1.1.336.4181
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as concentric rings on a slide (Dunn chamber)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zicha D. |author2=Dunn G.A. |author3=Brown A.F. | title= A new direct-viewing chemotaxis chamber.| journal= J Cell Sci | year=  1991 | volume= 99| pages=769–75|pmid= 1770004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentration gradient develops on a narrow connecting bridge between the chambers and the number of migrating cells is also counted on the surface of the bridge by light microscope. In some cases the bridge between the two chambers is filled with agar and cells have to "[[Bacterial gliding|glide]]" in this semisolid layer.

=== Capillary techniques ===
Some capillary techniques provide also a chamber like arrangement, however, there is no filter between the cells and the test substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Leick V. |author2=Helle J. | title= A quantitative assay for ciliate chemotaxis.| journal= Anal Biochem | year= 1983| volume= 135| pages=466–9 | doi= 10.1016/0003-2697(83)90713-3 | pmid= 6660520 | issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantitative results are gained by the multiwell type of this probe using 4-8-12-channel pipettes. Accuracy of the pipette and increased number of the parallel running samples is the great advantage of this test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Kőhidai, L., Lemberkovits, É. and Csaba, G.| title= Molecule dependent chemotactic responses of Tetrahymena pyriformis elicited by volatile oils.| journal= Acta Protozool | year= 1995| volume= 34| pages= 181–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counting of cells: positive responder cells are count from the lower chamber (long incubation time) or from the filter (short incubation time). For detection of cells general staining techniques (e.g. [[trypan blue]]) or special probes (e.g. mt-dehydrogenase detection with MTT assay) are used. Labelled (e.g. [[fluorochrome]]s) cells are also used, in some assays cells get labelled during transmigration the filter.

== Other techniques ==
[[Image:Chtx-other-techn.PNG|thumb|right|450px|Other chemotaxis assay techniques]]
Besides the above-mentioned two, most commonly used family of techniques a wide range of protocols were developed to measure chemotactic activity. Some of them are only qualitative, like aggregation tests, where small pieces of agar or filters are placed onto a slide and accumulation of cells around is measured.

In another semiquantitative technique cells are overlaid the test substance and changes in [[opalescence]] of the originally cell-free compartment is recorded during the incubation time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Koppelhus U. |author2=Hellung-Larsen P. |author3=Leick V. | title= An improved quantitative assay for chemokinesis in Tetrahymena.| journal= Biol Bull| year= 1994 | volume= 187| pages= 8–15 | doi= 10.2307/1542160 | pmid= 7918798 | issue= 1 | publisher= Marine Biological Laboratory | jstor= 1542160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third very frequently used, however, qualitative technique is the T-[[maze]] and its adaptations for microplates. In the original version a container drilled in a peg is filled with cells. Then the peg is twisted and the cells get contact with two other containers filled with different substances. The incubation is stopped with resetting the peg, the cell number is counted from the containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Van Houten J. |author2=Martel E. |author3=Kasch T. | title= Kinetic analysis of chemokinesis of Paramecium.| journal= J Protozool | year= 1982| volume= 29| pages= 226–30| pmid=7097615 | issue= 2 | doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.1982.tb04016.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, lately,{{When|date=January 2018}} microfluidic devices have been more and more frequently used to test quantitatively, and precisely, for chemotaxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seymour J.

'''Cytotaxonomy''' is the branch of biology dealing with the relationships and classification of organisms using comparative studies of chromosomes during meiosis.

==Description==
Cytotaxonomy is branch of taxonomy,which uses the characteristics of cellular structures,such as somatic chromosome to classify organism.Improvement in the cytological techniques permit chromosomal studies.The Study of primate chromosome is another very active field,which provide very much information on relationships(chiarelli,1996).
The number, structure, and behaviour of chromosomes is of great value in [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], with [[chromosome number]] being the most widely used and quoted character. Chromosome numbers are usually determined at [[mitosis]] and quoted as the [[diploid]] number (2n), unless dealing with a [[polyploid]] series in which case the base number or number of chromosomes in the genome of the original haploid is quoted. Another useful taxonomic character is the position of the [[centromere]]. [[Meiotic]] behaviour may show the [[heterozygosity]] of inversions. This may be constant for a taxon, offering further taxonomic evidence. Cytological data is regarded as having more significance than other taxonomic evidence.

A '''display case''' ('''showcase''', '''display cabinet''', or '''vitrine''') is a [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]] with one or often more [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] [[glass]] (or [[plastic]], normally [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] for strength) surfaces, used to display objects for viewing. A display case may appear in an [[exhibition]], [[museum]], [[Retailing|retail store]], [[restaurant]], or [[house]]. Often, labels are included with the displayed objects, providing information such as description or prices. In a museum, the displayed [[cultural artifact]]s are normally part of the museum's [[Collection (museum)|collection]], or are part of a temporary exhibition. In retail or a restaurant, the items are normally being offered for sale. A '''trophy case''' is used to display sports [[trophy|trophies]] or other awards.

==Description==
A display case may be freestanding on the floor, or built-in (usually a custom installation). Built-in displays may be mounted on the wall, may act as [[Room divider|room partitions]], or may be hung from the ceiling. On occasion, display cases are built into the floor, such as at the [[Museum of Sydney]] (in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]), where the remains of drains and [[Outhouse|privies]] are shown in their original context, along with other [[archeological artifact]]s.&lt;ref name=Sydney&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Sydney Guidebook|url=http://www.hht.net.au/discover/highlights/guidebooks/museum_of_sydney_guidebook|work=Sydney Living Museums|publisher=Historic Houses Trust of NSW|accessdate=2014-01-03|quote=Underfloor: The remains of first Government House’s drains and privies are exposed below the floor. Also displayed is a selection of relics, ruins and rubbish from the house retrieved by archaeologists in the 1980s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of freestanding showcases: counter, middle floor (mid-floor), and wall.&lt;ref name=TSC&gt;{{cite web|title=Display cases|url=http://theshopcompany.com/display-cases.html|work=The Shop Company|publisher=The Shop Company|accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Counter showcases are designed to display objects through one side (the "customer side") and have them accessible through the other (the "clerk side"). For this reason, the counter displays are most relevant for retail stores. The middle floor cases are built to display objects from all sides, and are meant to be placed in the middle of the room. Wall showcases are meant to be placed against a wall, where the products are displayed and accessed from the same side. These last two types are used heavily – not only by stores – but also by museums, schools, and especially in homes to showcase valuable items or collections. 

Display cases are typically made by specialist companies with a background in woodworking or welding, and come in standard sizes or often are custom order. Display cases are often designed with [[security]] in mind and are normally [[lockable]]. They also are made in variety of styles, shapes, and materials as available at a store fixture supplier. They can ship pre-assembled or [[Ready-to-assemble furniture|knockdown]] (in pieces to be assembled by the customer). Pre-assembled showcases are assembled (and usually tested) by the manufacturer, and are shipped ready-to-use. Knockdown showcases are usually lower in price and cheaper to ship, but may be of poorer quality than pre-assembled, and may arrive missing pieces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10393">[[Image:Circuit elements.svg|right|thumbnail|400px|Common circuit diagram symbols (US symbols)]]
An '''electronic symbol''' is a [[pictogram]] used to represent various [[electrical]] and [[Electronics|electronic]] devices or functions, such as [[wire]]s, [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[resistor]]s, and [[transistor]]s, in a [[schematic diagram]] of an electrical or [[electronic circuit]].  These symbols are largely standardized internationally today, but may vary from country to country, or engineering discipline, based on traditional conventions.

==Standards for symbols==
The graphic symbols used for electrical components in circuit diagrams are covered by national and international standards, in particular:
* [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60617 (also known as [[British Standard]] BS 3939).
* [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Y32.2-1975 (also known as IEEE Std 315-1975 or CSA Z99-1975)
* [[IEEE]] Std 91/91a: graphic symbols for logic functions (used in digital electronics). It is referenced in ANSI Y32.2/IEEE Std 315.
* Australian Standard AS 1102. (Withdrawn without replacement)

Symbols usage is sometimes unique to engineering disciplines and national or local variations to international standards exist. For example, lighting and power symbols used as part of architectural drawings may be different from symbols for devices used in electronics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29300">An important part of the heritage of '''family resilience''' is the concept of individual [[psychological resilience]] which originates from work with children focusing on what helped them become resilient in the face of adversity. Individual resilience emerged primarily in the field of [[developmental psychopathology]] as scholars sought to identify the characteristics of children that allowed them to function "OK" after adversity. Individual resilience gradually moved into understanding the processes associated with overcoming adversity, then into prevention and intervention and now focuses on examining how factors at multiple levels of the system (e.g., molecular, individual, family, community) and using interdisciplinary approaches (e.g., medical, social services, education) promote resilience.&lt;ref name="Luthar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masten &amp; Monn" /&gt; Resilience also has origins to the field of [[positive psychology]]. The term resilience gradually changed definitions and meanings, from a personality trait&lt;ref name="Ali" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masten &amp; Obradovic" /&gt; to a dynamic process of families, individuals, and communities.&lt;ref name="Luthar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh 2002" /&gt;

Family resilience emerged as scholars incorporated together ideas from general [[systems theory]] perspectives on families, family stress theory, and [[psychological resilience]] perspectives.&lt;ref name="Hawley" /&gt; Two prominent approaches to family resilience are to view families as contexts of individual resilience and families as systems.&lt;ref name="Patterson" /&gt; In the field of [[family therapy]] the families as systems approach to family resilience is often used based on the assumption that significant risk, protective mechanisms, and positive adaptation occur at multiple interrelated system levels (individual, subsystem, system, or ecosystem).&lt;ref name="Henry et al." /&gt; Thus, ''family resilience'' involves the application of concepts such as resilience, [[adaptation]] and [[coping (psychology)|coping]] to a significant stressor or [[adversity]] from a family systems perspective.

==Definition==

One of the common factors associated with successful adaptation and coping is identified as resilience of individual family members. [[Resilience (psychology)|Resilience]] can be generally defined as the ability to "bounce back" to healthy functioning when faced with significant stressors and events.&lt;ref name="Masten &amp; Obradovic" /&gt;  The concept of resilience has been heavily researched in adolescents and now includes specific character traits and behaviors known as protective and recovery factors.&lt;ref name="McCubbin &amp; Patterson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbin 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shin" /&gt; Previously, researchers have focused on identifying the characteristics of resilient individuals and started to explore the possibility of family resilience and family coping with stress.&lt;ref name="McCubbin &amp; Patterson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh 2003" /&gt; Currently, researchers are focused on specific interventions to increase resilience in the family unit, while considering related [[Genetics|genetic]] and environmental factors.&lt;ref name="Masten &amp; Obradovic" /&gt;

There are diverse definitions of what resilience and/or family resilience is. The National Network for Family Resiliency&lt;ref name="National Network" /&gt; defines resilience as "the family's ability to cultivate strengths to positively meet the challenges of life". Atkinson, Martin, &amp; Rankin&lt;ref name="Atkinson" /&gt; define resilience as "the ability to bounce back and have better physical and mental health outcomes". For family resilience specifically, McCubbin &amp; McCubbin&lt;ref name="McCubbin 1988" /&gt; have posited that "family resilience includes the characteristics, dimensions, and properties of families which help families to be resilient to disruption in the face of change and adaptive in the face of crisis situations".&lt;ref name="Black &amp; Lobo" /&gt;

Using a combination of the above work, family resilience can be generally defined as: a dynamic process of families that have been exposed to a significant stressor or adversity that requires protective and recovery factors, identified by the family, as helpful to promote healthy coping in families and their self-identified family members. In the February 2015 special issue of [[Family Relations (journal)]] on individual and family resilience,&lt;ref name="Criss" /&gt; authors provide a variety of definitions of family resilience. For example, Masten and Monn (p.&amp;nbsp;6) define resilience as "the capacity for adapting successfully in the context of adversity".&lt;ref name="Masten &amp; Monn" /&gt;

==Research==

Resilience and family resilience have been studied in the context of various theoretical underpinnings. These include [[Albert Bandura|Bandura's]] [[Self-efficacy|Self-Efficacy Theory]], [[Richard Lazarus|Lazarus]]' Stress Theory, Froma Walsh's Family Resilience Framework, and McCubbin and Patterson’s Family Stress and Resilience Model.
The family stress theory originates from the family systems model that considers all members of the family as important and as a system where all parts and interactions between and among those parts as important.&lt;ref name="Walsh 2003" /&gt; The Family Stress and Resilience Model by McCubbin &amp; McCubbin&lt;ref name="McCubbin 1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbin 1993" /&gt; has been adopted by the field of family [[nursing]] because of the use in [[wikt:diverse|diverse]] families and because of the connection to the nursing metaparadigm of person, environment, health, and nursing&lt;ref name="National Network" /&gt; This strong theoretical connection to resilience and nursing supports the interest from nursing, which focuses on caring for diverse families and individuals in a holistic manner.

Henry, Morris, &amp; Harrist&lt;ref name="Henry et al." /&gt; proposed the overarching Family Resilience Model (FRM) as a general model of family resilience within which existing models fit as ways of looking at family resilience. Based on a review of existing individual and family resilience scholarship, these authors developed the FRM to include key ideas from individual resilience, proposing that significant risk suggests increased risk for negative outcomes. This risk can be lowered through protective mechanisms, increasing the potential for positive outcomes, or heightened through vulnerabilities that pile up to increase the potential for negative outcomes.&lt;ref name="Henry et al." /&gt; However, significant risk, protection, vulnerability, and outcomes (or adaptation) occur within the context of family meanings, family adaptive systems (emotional systems, control systems, identity systems, maintenance systems, stress-response systems) in the particular family, and broader ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Henry et al." /&gt;

Resilience as a concept has been heavily studied on the individual level in children who have experienced significant [[Stress (biology)|stress]] or [[Adversity|adversities]]. Family resilience is another level of resilience that is related to complex relationships and environmental factors. Fields that have utilized resilience research include [[psychology]]&lt;ref name="Luthar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Patterson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saltzman" /&gt; [[sociology]],&lt;ref name="Hawley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, K., Bryant, D. D., Collins, D. A., Noe, T. D., Strader, T. N., &amp; Berbaum, M. (1998). Preventing and reducing alcohol and other drug use among high-risk youths by increasing family resilience. Health &amp; Social Work, 43 (4), 297-308.&lt;/ref&gt; [[education]],&lt;ref name="Masten &amp; Obradovic" /&gt; psychiatry&lt;ref name="MacDermid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sapienza" /&gt; and [[nursing]].&lt;ref name="Shin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Black &amp; Lobo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Earvolino-Ramirez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benzies" /&gt; The concept of resilience is attractive to many different health related fields because of all that remains unknown about the process, as well as the potential for reducing or preventing adverse outcomes due to significant experiences with adversity. Once thought of as simply a [[personality trait]], resilience has become known as a dynamic process with many related factors that can change throughout an individual’s life. Since resilience is also related to experience to stressors and ultimately results in healthy [[coping (psychology)|coping]], connections can be made with resilience literature, military family literature, and other stress/coping literature&lt;ref name="Ali" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbin 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbin 1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbin 1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Westphal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbin 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mansfield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lester" /&gt;

==Difference with individual resilience==

Family and individual resilience factors are not always the same. Family factors consist of [[stress management]], [[emotion regulation]] skills, [[goal setting|collaborative goal setting]] and [[problem solving]].&lt;ref name="Saltzman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simon" /&gt; In contrast, individual factors that foster resilience include [[Flexibility (personality)|flexibility]], use of [[social support]], rebounding, high expectations, humor, [[self-efficacy]], and [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name="Luthar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Earvolino-Ramirez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedl" /&gt; While few valid and reliable measures exist to measure resilience or family resilience specifically, much recent work has focused on measuring these attributes&lt;ref name="Benzies" /&gt; of resilient families.

Family resilience is a strengths-oriented approach that tends to emphasize positive outcomes at the overall family system level, within family systems, in individual family members, and in the family-ecosystem fit and recognize the subjective meanings families bring to understanding risk, protection, and adaptation.&lt;ref name="Henry et al." /&gt;

==Measuring==

According to Henry et al.&lt;ref name="Henry et al." /&gt; when examining family resilience is critical to be aware of some key issues: (a) '''significant risk''' must be present for resilience to occur, (b) other '''vulnerabilities''' (e.g., chronic illness, addiction, poor conflict management or communication beyond the focal risk may "pile-up" to present additional challenges; c) '''protection''' (factors or processes of resilience) must be distinguished from '''outcomes''' (short or long term indicators of resilience), (d) '''family situational meanings''' (how a family collectively perceives the risk, protection, and vulnerabilities) interact with risk, vulnerabilities, protection, and outcomes, (e) these all occur within '''family adaptive systems''' (patterns of interaction within families described as ''meaning systems, control systems, emotion systems, maintenance systems, stress-response systems'') and '''ecosystems'''. Thus, assessing resilience requires consideration of which component(s) the researcher is addressing. Further, measurement can occur at the level of the family-ecosystem (e.g., school-family, healthcare-family), overall family system, in family subsystems (e.g., couple relationships, sibling relationships, parent-child relationship, grandparent-grandchild relationship).&lt;ref name="Henry et al." /&gt; Once the researcher clarifies which level(s) upon which they wish to focus, measures can be identified at the appropriate level.

The problem with a nebulous definition of family resilience is that it is difficult to measure without a concrete definition. Specific measurement tools of resilience include the Family Strengths and Resilience Scale, [[Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale]], the Resilience Scale and other self-report measures such as Brief Symptom Inventory, [[Child Behavior Checklist]], Child Depression Inventory, and Mental Health Inventories&lt;ref name="Windle" /&gt; have been most commonly used.

One can also measure all of the attributes and antecedents of family resilience individually to attempt to capture what it means to be resilient at a certain phase of a family developmental cycle. Protective factors that can be quantitatively measured include: celebrations, [[Psychological resilience|hardiness]], time together, [[:wikt:routine|routines]], [[traditions]], [[communication]], [[Personal finance|financial management]], and [[health]].&lt;ref name="Black &amp; Lobo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lester" /&gt; These factors have been most important when starting to understand the protective factors of resilience, versus the recovery factors, which are employed when the [[crisis]] or challenge has already occurred and the family needs to [[:wikt:adapt|adapt]].  Recovery factors include: [[coping (psychology)|coping]], [[social support]], family support, esteem building, [[optimism]], [[recreation]], [[:wikt:control|control]], [[organization]], [[flexibility]], and [[hope]]. These factors are dependent upon the type of [[family]] that utilizes them and the need for certain factors depending upon the type of stressor (e.g. normative or non-normative). In short, it is difficult to measure family resilience.

Card and Barnett (2015) discuss four key methodological issues in researching individual and family resilience: psychometric properties (reliability, validity, measurement equivalence), causality in the absence of experimental research, contrasting variable centered and person centered approaches, and the multilevel nature of family resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/fare.12102 | volume=64 | title=Methodological Considerations in Studying Individual and Family Resilience | journal=Family Relations | pages=120–133 | last1 = Card | first1 = Noel A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family resilience prevention and intervention==

Professionals who work with families may employ a variety of educational, therapeutic, or community-based approaches to helping protect families against adversity or facilitate the abilities of families to mobilize their strengths or gain new resources to successfully rebound from adversity (i.e., demonstrate resilience). Examples of such approaches are to inoculate against risk (or expose families to low levels of risk in preparation for potential greater risks), reducing risk, increasing resources, or changing meanings to make them more manageable, according to Henry et a. (2015).&lt;ref name="Henry et al." /&gt;

==In military families==

Recent literature has focused on identifying healthy [[coping (psychology)|coping]] and [[adaptation]] in [[military]] families.&lt;ref name="Saltzman" /&gt; With the current wars across the world, more military members are being [[Military deployment|deployed]] and are struggling with various issues such as: [[mental illness]], [[substance abuse]], difficulty with transitions, changes in roles, and ensuring their family is safe and healthy.&lt;ref name="Mansfield" /&gt; The families of these military members are not immune to these stressors.&lt;ref name="Lester" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lester &amp; Bursch" /&gt; The stress associated with the military can lead to [[Depression (mood)|depression]] if adequate coping mechanisms are not employed, or if the family does not possess the needed support or strength to adapt to stressors.

The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] has collaborated with [[positive psychology]] scientists to create the [[Comprehensive Soldier Fitness]] program for members of the [[Army]]. More recently, the Family Skills Component of this program has been released for use by family members in the military.&lt;ref name="Chapin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottman" /&gt; New military, government, and [[public health]] initiatives are focused on fostering and promoting resilience in the military family overall. Initial results from [[pilot studies]] show that those who are resilient can better cope with stressors and are less likely to suffer from depression or alcohol use.&lt;ref name="Chapin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottman" /&gt;

The Comprehensive Soldier Fitness program in the U.S. Army is the first of its kind. With input from the positive psychology field, a program to increase the physical and psychological health of service members was implemented in 2009. The Family Skills Component of this program is meant to assist military spouses and family members to also increase their levels of resilience.

[[File:Louis Pasteur, Archives Photographiques.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis Pasteur]], Archives Photographiques]]
The '''fermentation theory''' was studied in depth and brought to light first by [[Louis Pasteur]]. This theory states that it is the idea or concept of how fermentation is brought on by microbes and put to the concept of spontaneous generation to rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pasteur|first=Louis|title=Physiological Theory of Fermentation|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1879pasteur-ferment.asp|publisher=Fordham University|accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though this theory is now outdated and has been replaced by the [[germ theory of disease]], for a long time it held true, and Louis was on the forefront of explaining why it seemed organisms appeared out of nothing instead of claiming it was just a spontaneous act of God. Fermentation was a process that has been used for thousands of years, but no one could explain exactly what was happening and why. From Pasteur's discovery of why and how fermentation occurs, the process has been studied intensely and is now a mastered art used in everyday life with processes of making things such as alcoholic beverages, some foods like yogurt or even manufacturing some medications.&lt;ref name=Viking&gt;{{cite web|last=Fiachson|first=Refr|title=Fermentation in Theory and Practice|url=http://vikingfoodguy.com/wordpress/papers/fermentation-in-theory-and-practice/|publisher=Viking Food Guy|accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="evolving science"&gt;{{cite book|last=Slonczewski|first=Joan|title=Microbiology: An Evolving Science 2nd edition|year=2009|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fermentation==
[[File:Gemischte Säuregärung.svg|thumb|Process of [[Fermentation]]]]
Simply put, [[fermentation]] is the anaerobic metabolic process that converts sugar into acids, gases, or alcohols. This metabolic process is used in oxygen starved environments. Yeast and many other microbes commonly use this process in order to carry our their [[anaerobic respiration]] to survive. Even the human body carries out fermentation processes from time to time. When someone runs a long distance race, lactic acid will build up in their muscles over the course of the race. That lactic acid is the by-product of fermentation taking place in their body, which tries to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] so the body can continue to run since they could not process the oxygen intake fast enough. Although fermentation will give a lower yield of ATP production than aerobic respiration does, it can occur at a much higher rate.
Fermentation has been used by humans consciously since around 5000 BCE where there were jars recovered in the Iran [[Zagros Mountains]] area in which contained remnants of a microbes similar those present in the process of making grapes into wine.
[[File:Fermentation lock.JPG|thumb|left|Example of a typical curved neck used today]]

==What the Theory is==
Before the 1870s, when Pasteur published his work on this theory, it was believed that microorganisms and even some small animals such as frogs would spontaneously appear, which was coined as [[spontaneous generation]]. Spontaneous generation was the explained theory that when elements of the Earth such as clay or mud would mix with water and sunlight in certain amounts, creatures would just appear out of that concoction. A common way that this idea was "proven" over and over again was by taking a piece of raw meat and placing it in open air, which would almost always produce maggots. This idea was accepted and believe to be true before Louis Pasteur shook the Earth with his new ideas that organisms actually came from traceable beginnings.&lt;ref name="evolving science"/&gt; Pasteur demonstrated that fermentation is caused by the growth of microorganisms, and the emergent growth of bacteria in nutrient broths is due to [[biogenesis]] rather than spontaneous generation. He exposed boiled broths to air in vessels that contained a filter to prevent all particles from passing through to the growth medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abbott|first=David|title=Louis Pasteur|url=http://enlightenmentindividuals.weebly.com/germ-theory-of-fermentation.html|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, when the vessels were open to the air surrounding it, the organisms appeared. It could be concluded that spontaneous generation could be disproven. The organisms did not just appear but were coming from the air, yet we were not able to see them at such a small level. His famous experiment was used with a curved neck placed on top of a beaker. This curved neck was the key to proving his findings because it showed that the germs and microbes had to fall into the broth inside. The curved neck did not allow this to happen.

The '''fermentation theory''' of [[disease]] is the (now obsolete) concept that many diseases, including the diseases which were "epidemic, endemic and contagious", owe their origin to the presence of a "morbific principle" in the system, acting in a manner analogous to, although not identical with, the process of [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]. It was rendered obsolete by the [[germ theory of disease]], which led to the new science of [[bacteriology]].

==Application==
Fermenting a broth in a beaker has become more than just a way to prove that organisms don't just appear out of thin air. Today, the process of fermentation is used for a multitude of everyday applications. Some of those processes include medications which we ingest, beverages we consume, and even food we eat. Currently, companies like [[Genencor]] International uses the production of enzymes involved in fermentation to build a revenue of over $400 million a year.&lt;ref name="evolving science"/&gt; Many medications such as antibiotics are produced by the fermentation process. An example is the important drug [[cortisone]], which can be prepared by the fermentation of a plant steroid known as [[diosgenin]]. [[File:Burton Union fermentation system, Coors Visitor Centre - geograph.org.uk - 476438.jpg|thumb|Burton Union fermentation system, Coors Visitor Centre]]
The enzymes used in the reaction are provided by the mold [[Rhizopus nigricans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fermentation Uses|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/2677/Fermentation-Uses.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as it is commonly known, alcohol of all types and brands are also produced by way of fermentation and [[distillation]]. [[Moonshine]] is a classic example of how this is carried out. Finally, foods such as yogurt are made by fermentation processes as well. Yogurt is a fermented milk product that contains the characteristic bacterial cultures [[Lactobacillus bulgaricus]] and Streptococcus thermopiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milk Facts|url=http://www.milkfacts.info/Milk%20Processing/Yogurt%20Production.htm|work=Yogurt Production|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland''' ({{lang-da|Danmarks og Grønlands Geologiske Undersøgelse, GEUS}}) is the independent [[Sector research institutes of Denmark|sector research institute]] under the Danish [[Ministry of Climate and Energy (Denmark)|Ministry of Climate and Energy]].  GEUS is an advisory, research and survey institute in [[hydrogeology]], [[geophysics]], [[geochemistry]], [[stratigraphy]], [[glaciology]], [[ore geology]], [[marine geology]], [[mineralogy]], [[climatology]], environmental history, air photo [[wikt:interpretation|interpretation]], [[geothermal energy]] fields concerning [[Denmark]] and [[Greenland]].

GEUS works in close corporation with [[Geologisk Institut]] and [[Geologisk Museum]], both part of [[University of Copenhagen]].

It publishes a service paper called ''Greenland Hydrocarbon Exploration Information Service''  (GHEXIS) and a newsletter called Greenland Mineral Exploration Newsletter  (MINEX) in co-operation with the [[Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum]] (Råstofdirektoratet), a secretariat for the Joint Committee on Mineral Resources under Greenland’s home rule.

==History==
In 1888 {{lang|da|Danmarks Geologiske Undersøgelse}} (DGU) was founded{{by whom?|date=January 2015}}. 

In 1946, {{lang|da|Grønlands Geologiske Undersøgelse}} was created.  

On 14 June 1965, law no. 238 created GGU.

On 23 December 1987, law no. 864 merged GGU into DGU, changing its name to DGGU ({{lang|da|Danmarks og Grønlands Geologiske Undersøgelse}}).

On 14 June 1995, Law no. 408  disbanded law no. 238. 

On 20 December 1995, law no. 1076 concerning Danish sector research institutes created GEUS by merging DGU and GGU.

[[Gifted]] students are outstanding learners who are not usually considered risking academic failure or problems. However, gifted students can still [[Underachiever|underachieve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.gifted.uconn.edu/siegle/publications/GCQDifferentiateUnderachieving.pdf | title=Factors That Differentiate Underachieving Gifted Students From High-Achieving Gifted Students | author=D. Betsy McCoach, Del Siegle | journal=Gifted Child Quarterly |date=Spring 2003 | volume=47 | issue=2 | pages=144-154 | doi=10.1177/001698620304700205}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are risks related to the student's giftedness. This concept was formally set forth in 1972 in the U.S. in the [[Marland report|Marland Report]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Gifted and talented children are, in fact, deprived and can suffer psychological damage and permanent impairment of their abilities to function well which is equal to or greater than the similar deprivation suffered by any other population with special needs served by the Office of Education.&lt;ref&gt;Marland, S. P., Jr. (1972). [http://www.valdosta.edu/colleges/education/psychology-and-counseling/documents/marland-report.pdf Education of the gifted and talented] Report to the Congress of the United States by the U.S. Commissioner of Education and background papers submitted to the U.S. Office of Education, 2 vols. Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office. (Government Documents Y4.L 11/2: G36), pp. xi-xii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Specific risks==
At first glance, labeling gifted children ‘at-risk’ seems to be questionable to those who are unfamiliar with the research.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} However, the following risks are listed in ''The Social and Emotional Development of Gifted Children'':&lt;ref&gt;''The Social and Emotional Development of Gifted Children: What Do We Know?'', Edited by Maureen Neihart, Sally M. Reis, Nancy M. Robinson, and Sidney M. Moon; National Association of Gifted Children (Prufrock Press, Inc.), 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
* frustration, irritability, anxiety, tedium, and social isolation (p.&amp;nbsp;11)
* intense social isolation and stress among those with IQ greater than 160 (p.&amp;nbsp;14)
* difficulty making friends due to advanced concept of friendship, mostly among those less than age 10 (p.&amp;nbsp;23)
* de-motivation, low self-esteem, and social rejection among the exceptionally gifted (p.&amp;nbsp;26)
* emotional awareness beyond their ability to control (p.&amp;nbsp;34)
* difficulty with peer relations proportional to their IQ (p.&amp;nbsp;35)
* loneliness, anxieties, phobias, interpersonal problems, fear of failure, and perfectionism (p.&amp;nbsp;43)
* underachievement for social acceptance (p.&amp;nbsp;64)
* lack of resilience reinforced by easy work and well-intentioned but misguided praise (p.&amp;nbsp;65)
* increasing perfectionism throughout school years among girls (p.&amp;nbsp;75)
* fear of failure and risk avoidance due to perfectionism (p.&amp;nbsp;75)
* depression among creatively gifted (p.&amp;nbsp;93)

There is a cause-and-effect relationship between the unmet learning needs of gifted students and the above risks. “Research indicates that many of the emotional and social difficulties gifted students experience disappear when their educational climates are adapted to their level and pace of learning.”&lt;ref&gt;Neihart et al., p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linda Kreger Silverman enumerates these additional risks:&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, L.K. (1987). ‘Applying knowledge about social development to the counseling process with gifted adolescents.’ in T.M. Buescher (Ed.). ''Understanding Gifted and Talented Adolescents'' (pp. 40-44). Evanston, IL: The Center for Talent Development.&lt;/ref&gt;
* refusal to do routine, repetitive assignments 
* inappropriate criticism of others 
* lack of awareness of impact on others 
* difficulty accepting criticism
* hiding talents to fit in with peers 
* nonconformity and resistance to authority 
* poor study habits 

Further, there exists anecdotal evidence of truancy problems with gifted children, who sometimes miss school because of disengagement, and worse, fear of bullying.  In 1999, legislation was introduced in Colorado to recognize gifted students as at-risk, with truancy as a factor, but the bill did not become law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/sess1999/hbills99/hb1210.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  

Lastly, meta-analysis from the paper “Gifted Students Who Drop Out—Who and Why: A Meta-Analytical Review of the Literature” by Kaskaloglu shows two key points.  First, 4.5% of high school dropouts are gifted, and they leave school in part because of school-related issues.&lt;ref&gt;Kaskaloglu, E. (2003). “Gifted Students Who Drop Out—Who and Why: A Meta-Analytical Review of the Literature”, Proceedings of the [[Hawaii International Conference on Education]].&lt;/ref&gt; To understand the drop out rate, one must consider that the study cited indicates the percentage of children who both dropped out and who scored above 130 on an IQ test. One would expect a very small percentage of such children to drop out, given the ease with which they can excel in school.  To expect more than one in ten would be hard to justify.  Therefore, with only 2.27% of people scoring above 130 on IQ tests, to expect greater than 0.227% of dropouts to be gifted would be ostensibly far-fetched.  Unfortunately, the actual percentage is closer to twenty times that.  According to the ''Achievement Trap'', this problem is even more pronounced among economically disadvantaged children.&lt;ref&gt;Wyner, J., Bridgeland, J., and DiIulio, Jr., J..  Achievement Trap: How America Is Failing Millions of High-Achieving Students from Lower-Income Families. Jack Kent Cooke Foundation &amp; Civic Enterprises, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance of Gifted Programs ==
The National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC) maintains that gifted students and those with outstanding abilities require gifted education programs. Such programs will serve as tests in actual classroom settings allowing these youngsters to sustain their progress while in school. Gifted programs can positive shape the future of these children. Some longitudinal or observational research studies demonstrated that these talented programs have positive effects on post-secondary plans of these kids&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nagc.org/resources-publications/gifted-education-practices/why-are-gifted-programs-needed|title=Why Are Gifted Programs Needed? {{!}} National Association for Gifted Children|website=www.nagc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iwh.on.ca/what-researchers-mean-by/cross-sectional-vs-longitudinal-studies|title=Cross-sectional vs. longitudinal studies {{!}} Institute for Work &amp; Health|website=www.iwh.on.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1996, American educational psychologists/educators Camila Benbow and Julian Stanley published a treatise that reviewed many years of evidence illustrating accomplishments of students with extreme intellectual potentials have declined significantly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.intelltheory.com/benbow.shtml|title=Human Intelligence: Camilla P. Benbow|website=www.intelltheory.com|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One of the major arguments of Benbow and Stanley pointed out the K-12 budget for federal education allocated a measly 0.0002 percent for gifted education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/a-nation-at-risk-how-gifted-low-income-kids-are-left-behind-56119|title=A nation at risk -- how gifted, low-income kids are left behind|last=Worrell|first=Frank C.|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

20 years later, another journal, Policy Insights from Behavioral and Brain Sciences published a paper showing this figure has not changed. In 2015, the budget for federal education was $49.8 billion with only 0.0002 percent apportioned to gifted education. Continuing inadequate investment in gifted children for several decades generated a massive gap between educational, leadership, and professional (work-related) attainment of low-income and high-income youngsters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.socialsciencespace.com/about-policy-insights-from-the-behavioral-and-brain-sciences/|title=About 'Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences' - Social Science Space|work=Social Science Space|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Jack Kent Cookie Foundation conducted an independent study in 2007 which established that endowed but low-income students fail to reach their full potentials. This Foundation maintains scholarship programs that motivate and support exceptional and hard-working students with financial issues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/|title=Scholarship Programs {{!}} Jack Kent Cooke Foundation|website=www.jkcf.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Stanford University professor and Hoover fellow Caroline M. Hoxby and The Leadership Gift president Christopher Avery conducted a study on high achievers but belonging to financially deprived households and found out these young people do not attempt to enter the country’s top educational institutions. The New York Times (March 16, 2013) published an article that the two educators analyzed students who took the SAT standardized test the previous year. Based on that data, these researchers found out a low 34% of seniors with the highest scores in the bottom portion of income distribution enrolled one of the United States’ 238 most discriminating colleges&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hoover.org/news/hoxby-study-low-income-students-featured-new-york-times|title=Hoxby study on low-income students featured in New York Times|work=Hoover Institution|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

2018 statistics from the Department of Education revealed that demand for the Gifted and Talented Program continues to decline. Some 6.773 qualified children applied for possible positions in the Kindergarten through Third Grade program which is the lowest figure since 2014. The number is down 16 percent during that year when more than 8,000 students inquired about placement. The DOE’s position is this decline in applicants for said program comes from population transfer or contentment with zoned schools&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2018/06/01/number-of-applicants-for-does-gifted-and-talented-program-declines/|title=Number of applicants for DOE’s Gifted and Talented program declines|date=2018-06-02|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The idea of '''head music''' versus '''body music''' is an aesthetic idea in musicology.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Downes ''Aesthetics of Music: Musicological Perspectives''  2014 1136486917 p33  "Rock and roll has to be body music, before it can be head music, or it will wind up being neither' (Landau 1972, 134)."&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction has been illustrated by comparing [[rock n roll]] with [[progressive rock]], where the intention turned to innovation and experimentation, and "to offer 'head music' for thinking rather than body music for dancing".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Partridge, Marcus Moberg   The Bloomsbury Handbook of Religion and Popular Music 2017 1474237355- Page 61  "With progressive rock, the programme was to innovate, to experimentformally, and to offer 'head music' for thinking rather than body music for dancing."&lt;/ref&gt;

Elgot]], [[Peter Landin]], and [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], to create an [[operational semantics]] that could define the whole of IBM's [[PL/I]] programming language. The [[meta-language]] used for this was dubbed by people outside the laboratory as the [[Vienna Definition Language]] (VDL).

'''Institut Mines-Télécom''' is a French public academic institution dedicated to Higher Education and Research for Innovation in the fields of engineering and digital technology, organized as a [[Collegiate University]]. Created in 1996, it was originally known as the "Groupe des écoles des télécommunications", or GET, followed by the "Institut Télécom". The Mines schools, which were placed under the administrative supervision of the Ministry of Industry, joined the Institut in March 2012 when it took on its current name and gained the status of [[Grand établissement]]. it combines high academic and scientific legitimacy with a practical proximity to business and a unique positioning in 3 major transformations of the 21st century: Digital Affairs, Energy and Ecology, and Industry. Its training and research for innovation are rolled out in the Mines and Télécom Graduate Schools. The Institut falls under the administrative aegis of the [[General Council for the Economy, Industry, Energy and Technologies]].

Institut Mines-Télécom is a founding member of the Industry of the Future Alliance and the [[University of Paris-Saclay]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/university/members Members and associates]&lt;/ref&gt; It maintains close relationships with the economic world and has two Carnot Institutes.

Every year around one hundred startup companies leave its incubators.

==History==

In 1996, the [[France Télécom]] monopoly in telecommunications ended. The group of telecommunications schools was established in the form of an [[Établissement public à caractère administratif]] (public establishment of an administrative nature), for the purpose of managing the three schools: the École nationale supérieure des télécommunications; the École nationale supérieure des télécommunications de Bretagne and the Institut national des télécommunications. The group was renamed the "Institut Télécom" in 2008.
On 1 March 2012, it was renamed the "Institut Mines-Télécom" and converted to an [[EPCSCP - Grand Établissement]]. The six Mines schools under the supervision of the [[Ministry for the Economy, Finances and Industry]] joined the Institut by convention.

==Schools==

Institut Mines-Télécom is composed of eight schools ([[Grandes Écoles]]):

* [[IMT Atlantique]] in [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Rennes]], [[Nantes]], and [[Toulouse]] (ex École nationale supérieure des télécommunications de Bretagne, or ENST Bretagne merged with ex Ecole des Mines de Nantes in 2017),

'''Institute of Forestry and Environmental Sciences''', CU (IFESCU) was established in 1976 as Institute of Forestry with the help of [[Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (Bangladesh)|Ministry of Environment and Forest]], and [[Bangladesh Forest Department]], under [[University of Chittagong]], [[Bangladesh]]. It's the pioneer institute for forestry education in Bangladesh. Later, it was renamed as Institute of Forestry and Environmental Sciences in 1996. The Institute started providing in-service training (Master of Forestry) to newly recruited ACF (Assistant Conservator of Forests) in 1977-78, regular 4-year B.Sc. (Hons.) in [[Forestry]] in 1978-79, M.Sc. in [[Forestry]] in 1996, B.Sc. (Hons.) in [[Environmental Science]] in 2000-2001 and M.Sc. in [[Environmental Science]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Forestry and Environmental Sciences |url=http://www.cu.ac.bd/ctguni/index.php?option=com_cudata&amp;task=institute%20of%20forestry%20and%20environmental%20sciences |publisher=University of Chittagong |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LGBT sex education''' refers to an educational program, most commonly found in schools, that addresses the [[sex education]] needs of [[LGBT|LGBT individuals]] and covers topics related to [[homosexuality]]. It is usually integrated into the general sex education courses (alongside [[heterosexual]] topics). There is disagreement about whether LGBT sex education should be included in [[sex education]] curricula. Advocates of LGBT sex education say that the inclusion of LGBT issues into sex education programs would reduce [[homophobia|homophobic]] bullying, improve the health of LGBT people, and decrease instances of problems common in LGBT students such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and low [[self-esteem]]. Opponents argue that LGBT sex education programs would force a political point of view on students, misuse tax money, and disrespect religious values. As of 2014, only 5% of middle and high schoolers in the United States reported receiving "positive discussions of LGBT-related topics" within their health classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tolerance.org/magazine/number-53-summer-2016/feature/new-sex-ed|title=The New Sex Ed {{!}} Teaching Tolerance - Diversity, Equity and Justice|website=www.tolerance.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-29|date=2016-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
LGBT sex education is currently not covered in many schools.&lt;ref name=Formby&gt;{{cite journal|last=Formby|first=Eleanor|title=Sex and relationships education, sexual health, and lesbian, gay and bisexual sexual cultures: views from young people|journal=Sex Education|date=August 2011|volume=11|issue=3|pages=255–266|doi=10.1080/14681811.2011.590078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also posited that students often don’t find existing LGBT sex education programs to be effective. Teachers have differing views on the subject of homosexuality, and these personal opinions can impact LGBT sex education when it is implemented.&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Viv|author2=High |title=Something More to Tell You: Lesbian, Gay, or Bisexual Young Peoples|journal=Journal of Adolescence|date=April 2004|volume=30|issue=2|pages=213–225|doi=10.1080/0141192042000195281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research on LGBT sex education===

Multiple studies have concluded that LGBT sex education is often not encompassed in school sex education courses and that most students do not receive effective instruction in LGBT sex issues.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrow&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrow|first=Deana|title=Social Work with Gay and Lesbian Adolescents|journal=Social Work|date=November 1993|volume=38|issue=6|pages=655–660|accessdate=20 October 2013|url=https://academic.oup.com/sw/article-abstract/38/6/655/1880044|doi=10.1093/sw/38.6.655}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Ellis and High in the UK (2004), 384 students were surveyed; they found that 24% had not received instruction in LGBT sex issues.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt; The CDC Division of Adolescent and School Health’s study revealed that 48% of schools in the US covered LGBT topics.&lt;ref name=SEICUS&gt;{{cite web|title=Questions and Answers: LGBTQ Youth Issues|url=http://www.siecus.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=605&amp;grandparentID=477&amp;parentID=591#teach|work=SEICUS|publisher=SEICUS|accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research reported by Burston and Hart in 2001, 45% of surveyed students believed that they did not cover LGBT sex education sufficiently in school. Research has also shown that there can be an implicit assumption that all students are heterosexual in sex education classes.&lt;ref name=Buston&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buston|first=Katie|author2=Hart |title=Heterosexism and homophobia in Scottish school sex education: exploring the nature of the problem|journal=Journal of Adolescence|date=February 2001|volume=4|issue=1|pages=95–109|doi=10.1006/jado.2000.0366|pmid=11259073}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LGBT students in Eleanor Formby’s 2011 study of sex education said that they do not always feel welcomed by sex education classes or at school.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; Sex education courses commonly idealize marriage (not acknowledging that many countries outlaw same-sex marriage) thereby presenting a heterosexual view of sex and relationships as normal.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; Studies have suggested that sex education programs often do not cover safe sex practices for LGBT individuals.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt;&lt;ref name=CSW&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanchez |first=Marisol |title=Providing inclusive sex education in schools will address the health needs of LGBT Youth |url=http://www.csw.ucla.edu/publications/policy-briefs/policy-briefs/CSWPolicyBrief11.pdf |publisher=Center for the Study of Women UCLA |accessdate=October 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102525/https://www.csw.ucla.edu/publications/policy-briefs/policy-briefs/CSWPolicyBrief11.pdf |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are some sex education curricula that do cover LGBT issues.&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; For example, the [[Unitarian Universalist Association|Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations]] provides a sex education program called [[Our Whole Lives]], which includes discussion of sexual orientation and presents homosexuality and heterosexuality as equally valid. Our Whole Lives offers programs designed for a range of developmental stages, from Kindergarten-level through adulthood, and follows the "Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education" that the [[Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States]] (SIECUS) endorses.&lt;ref name=UUAC&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Whole Lives Lifespan Sexuality Education Curricula|url=http://www.uua.org/re/owl/|work=Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations|accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCC&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Whole Lives|url=http://www.ucc.org/justice/sexuality-education/our-whole-lives.html|work=The United Church of Christ|accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Church of Christ]] also supports Our Whole Lives.&lt;ref name=UCC/&gt;

==Issues with Current Sex Education Programs==

Research has  illustrated that some sex education courses present LGBT issues in a negative light—portraying LGBT individuals and LGBT sexuality as something wrong, sick, and abnormal.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt; According to the American Civil Liberties Union, “[[Abstinence-only sex education|Abstinence-only]]” approaches to sex education can also be alienating to LGBT students because these programs assume that marriage is a possibility and a desire for all students; however, same-sex marriage is illegal in many countries.&lt;ref name="ACLU"&gt;{{cite web|last=American Civil Liberties Union|title=Helping Teens Make Healthy and Responsible Decisions About Sex|url=https://www.aclu.org/reproductive-freedom/helping-teens-make-healthy-and-responsible-decisions-about-sex|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, promoting marriage as the goal for LGBT students reproduces a [[homonormative]] standard, marginalizing those without access to or interest in marriage.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexuality in School: the Limits of Education|last=Gilbert|first=Jen|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis and High’s survey research in 2004 (including 384 students) revealed that 59% of young people who did receive LGBT sex education found it to be ineffective.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt;

===Teachers===

Teachers have been identified as a hindrance to LGBT sex education in some studies. Teachers always have their own opinions about homosexuality, and, according to these studies, if teachers have negative views toward LGBT individuals this can come through in their teaching—causing LGBT students to feel unaccepted and unsafe.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; According to Ellis and High (2004), when LGBT students receive information about LGBT sexuality with negative undertones they are left feeling significantly worse and more unsafe than if homosexuality were left out of the curriculum.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt; Researchers have documented multiple self-proclaimed "LGBT-friendly" teachers whose classrooms actually foster prejudiced lessons. Such teachers are also highly likely to ignore instances of homophobic bullying directed at LGBT youth within their classes.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; Burston and Hart (2001) reported that teachers sometimes believe that they should not take a side on the issue of homosexuality, and therefore should not interfere when homophobia occurs in the classroom.&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; According to Formby (2011), even phrasing that subtly casts homosexuality in a negative light can have a detrimental effect on LGBT students’ experience of sex education.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt;

There have also been issues around teachers feeling free to teach sex education that equally emphasizes both heterosexual and homosexual health information.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; Deana Morrow’s study (1993) reported that some teachers said they were afraid they might be fired if they discussed LGBT issues.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; This fear is linked to the historical misconnection of homosexuality to molestation in the United States; this supposedly natural linkage has been debunked multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blount|first=JM|date=|title=The Historical Regulation of Sexuality and Gender of Students and Teachers|url=|journal=Youth and Sexualities|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, straight and LGBT teachers alike still experience allegations of molestation when they engage in discussions surrounding sexuality, particularly those discussions that are LGBT related.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"/&gt; Teachers can also feel hindered because the school environment is inhospitable to homosexuality; in Burston and Hart’s 2001 study, some even said that they were under the impression that the school would not allow them to teach LGBT sex education.&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt;

Classmates can also be non-receptive toward LGBT issues in current sex education courses, and students are often hesitant to talk about homosexuality, according to Buston and Hart (2001).&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt;

=== Home ===
Since sex education has been present in health education in schools, many parents expect their children to learn about sex there.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Estes|first=Michelle L.|date=2017-03-09|title=“If There’s One Benefit, You’re not Going to Get Pregnant”: the Sexual Miseducation of Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Individuals|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-017-0749-8|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=77|issue=9-10|pages=615–627|doi=10.1007/s11199-017-0749-8|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;Studies show that most families do not engage in conversation about sex in the home, and when they do it is often from a heternormative perspective. The assumptions of being heterosexual can make LGBT people feel ashamed or lacking support from their family. Lack of conversation and knowledge received in the home for LGBT people can often lead them to receive their information for outside sources.[[File:Rainbow Heart 181x182.png|thumbnail|The rainbow heart symbolizes LGB relationships]]

==Proposed LGBT sex education programs==
Advocates for LGBT sex education have suggested adjustments to current sex education practices in schools. One common place for improvement that researchers have identified is the angle from which sex education is approached in general. Buston and Hart (2001), Ellis and High (2004), and others have recommended that teachers frame sex education in terms of relationships rather than merely reproduction, which can lead to the exclusion of LGBT students.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; Ellis and High mention that sexual orientation might be more appropriately taught as “an aspect of culture and identity” (Ellis and High 2004, pg. 11).&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt; Other researchers such as Morrow (1993) believe that in order for sex education to be effective, it must present LGB as just as natural and legitimate as heterosexuality.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; Advocates for LGBT sex education ask that LGBT sexual health issues be given equal weight in the curriculum accordingly.&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; They also say that more resources concerning LGBT sexual health issues need to be made available to students.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; According to [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]'s Center for the Study of Women’s Policy Brief 11 (2012), LBGT students may not be willing to reach out for guidance themselves.&lt;ref name=CSW/&gt;

Researchers have recommended that teachers in sex education programs avoid framing homosexuality as something that is fundamentally connected to sexually transmitted diseases and refrain from practices that are potentially detrimental to LGBT students, such as referring to partners as specifically “him” or “her” (better to use the more flexible “they”).&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt;  Gowen and Winges-Yanez (2014) suggest through their focus groups on LGBT teens that there are several problems with the way sex education is taught.  The teens cited silencing, heterocentricity, and pathologizing of LGBT individuals as common practices.  When asked how they would improve sex education, the group said inclusive sex education would include discussion of LGBT issues, learning how to access resources, [[Sexually Transmitted Infection|STI]] prevention, relationships, and anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gowen | last2 = Winges-Yanez | year = 2014 | title = Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning youths' perspectives of inclusive school-based sexuality education | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 51 | issue = 7| pages = 788–800 | pmid = 24003908 | doi=10.1080/00224499.2013.806648}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Advocates for LGBT rights also say that teachers need to abandon any reluctance to take a side in the debate about homosexuality.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;

There are also alternative sexual education programs for LGBT people, such as that of an online sexual education course. According to a study evaluating the effectiveness of an online, interactive sexual education program for LGBT people, all subsections recorded statistically significant improvement of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mustanski|first=Brian|last2=Greene|first2=George J.|last3=Ryan|first3=Daniel|last4=Whitton|first4=Sarah W.|date=2014-03-03|title=Feasibility, Acceptability, and Initial Efficacy of an Online Sexual Health Promotion Program for LGBT Youth: The Queer Sex Ed Intervention|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2013.867924|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|language=en|volume=52|issue=2|pages=220–230|doi=10.1080/00224499.2013.867924|issn=0022-4499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the topics included safe sex practices, healthy relationships, pleasure and sexually transmitted infections. This type of program also created an online community for people taking the course to ask questions and interact with each other. This social aspect of the program also created a sense of normalcy and acceptance. Online programs could offer a means of education for those who cannot receive it in school.

==Support for LGBT sex education==
Proponents of incorporating LGBT sex education into school curricula commonly present several arguments. According to the [[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post]], some supporters claim that failing to include LGBT issues in sex education programs will overlook a significant number of students who identify as LGBT;&lt;ref name=HP&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodman|first=Josh|title=5 Reasons Schools Should Adopt LGBTQ-inclusive Sex Ed|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-a-goodman/lgbtq-inclusive-sex-ed_b_3834914.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2013-11-02|date=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Center for American Progress]] (CAP) says that this can cause them to feel marginalized and removed from the lesson because it doesn’t pertain to them.&lt;ref name=CAP&gt;{{cite web|last=Slater|first=Hannah|title=LGBT-Inclusive Sex Education Means Healthier Youth and Safer Schools|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2013/06/21/67411/lgbt-inclusive-sex-education-means-healthier-youth-and-safer-schools/|work=Center for American Progress|accessdate=2013-11-02|date=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT sex education advocates also argue that leaving LGBT safe sex instruction out of the curriculum will increase the likelihood of health problems for LGBT students.&lt;ref name=CSW/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt; Supporters say that since LGBT people are particularly at risk for [[HIV/AIDS]], it is especially important to provide them with sexual health information.&lt;ref name="Pink News"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Scott|title=National AIDS Trust welcomes Labour's call for LGBT inclusive sex education|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/06/10/national-aids-trust-welcomes-labours-call-for-lgbt-inclusive-sex-education/|work=Pink News|accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to researcher Eleanor Formby (2011), lesbian women are a high-risk group for [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs), because many do not know that they can be susceptible to STDs or how to engage in safe sex. Therefore, it is important that they receive lesbian sex education.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; LGBT sex education advocates suggest that because LGBT students aren’t taught sex education that pertains to them in school, they feel unprepared for sex, unable to talk about it openly, and have to learn about it by themselves—which can result in negative health outcomes.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt; Sanchez (2012) argues that LGBT students are unlikely to reach out to resources that could give them good information on their own, which furthers the need for LGBT sex education in schools.&lt;ref name=CSW/&gt;

[[File:Showing your pride - DC Gay Pride Parade 2012 (7356403050).jpg|thumbnail|Parade attendees wave rainbow flags at the 2012 Washington, D.C. Capital Pride parade]]

LGBT sex education supporters have also argued that the inclusion of LGBT topics in the curriculum can decrease instances of bullying in schools by familiarizing students with the range of [[sexual orientation]]s and reducing harmful [[stereotype]]s.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;&lt;ref name=HP/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt; The Center for American Progress argues that LGBT sex education results in a decrease in homophobic comments. According to the Huffington Post, supporters say that educating young people about LGBT individuals could help them have a more positive attitude toward their gay peers.&lt;ref name=HP/&gt; The Center for American Progress (2013) says that LGBT sex education would therefore reduce common problems LGBT students face as a result of negative attitudes; these include mental health issues like depression, the risk of suicide, drug abuse, self-esteem issues, and poorer academic performance due to stress caused by discrimination. They argue that covering homosexuality in sex education programs helps students feel more secure at school.&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt;

According to Jen Gilbert, associate professor of education at York University, LGBT kids often do not have queer parents who they can ask for sexuality-related advice, nor access to LGBT adults. LGBT sex education could potentially fill this gap and provide LGBT students with elders well-versed in their specific needs and equipped with affirming information, that students are otherwise unable to receive at home or in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexuality in School: the Limits of Education|last=Gilbert|first=Jen|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, proponents of LGBT sex education have said that curricula that explore all facets of sexuality would be beneficial to straight students as well, because they claim that it presents a more accurate picture of the world and human sexuality. A study of Gay/Straight Alliances in Utah found that peer-facilitated discussions concerning the spectrum of sexuality and gender identities benefitted both straight and LGBT students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Camille|date=February–March 2002|title=The Impact of Belonging to a High School Gay/Straight Alliance|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/13897/summary|journal=The High School Journal|volume=85|issue=3|pages=13–26|doi=10.1353/hsj.2002.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It exposed them to the reality of relationships outside of the heteronormative images that dominate media (as well as sex education), and even positively impacted all involved students' academic performance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Proponents also argue that offering LGBT-inclusive sex education can be of major assistance to any questioning students that might be in the class.&lt;ref name=HP/&gt;

According to the Center for American Progress (2013), the majority of parents support including homosexuality in the sex education curriculum; they report that 73% of high school parents think LGBT issues should be taught. The CAP claims that this high percentage of support indicates that LGBT topics should be incorporated.&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt;

==Opposition to LGBT sex education==
Opponents of LGBT sex education argue that it is wrong to teach students about the issue of homosexuality because it is too contentious. They say that parents should have control over what their children are exposed to and taught, and allowing public schools to cover LGBT sex education would undermine this right, forcing a particular political view on students. According to the [[The Christian Post|Christian Post]], some parents do not want their children to study homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Christian Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/sex-education-in-schools-should-include-a-gay-agenda-report-claims-66976/|title=Sex Education in Schools Should Include a Gay Agenda, Report Claims|last=Villalva|first=Brittney|work=The Christian Post|accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics often cite a misuse of citizens' tax dollars; claiming citizens' should not have to pay for children to learn about other lifestyles that their parents do not agree with.&lt;ref name="Moran"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moran|first=Joe|date=1 February 2001|title=Childhood Sexualities and Education: The Case of Section 28|journal=Sexualities|volume=4|issue=1|pages=73–89|doi=10.1177/136346001004001004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Formby (2011), opponents have also argued that LGBT sex education is harmful to students because they say it exposes them to damaging information.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; They claim that the students should not learn about LGBT issues until they are older.&lt;ref name="Christian Post" /&gt; Some opponents of LGBT sex education have argued that including LGBT issues in sex education programs will encourage more young people to practice homosexuality as well.&lt;ref name="Morrow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/09/education/09clash.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|title=Gay Rights Battlefields Spread to Public Schools|last=Janofsky|first=Michael|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2013-11-02|date=2005-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
LGBT sex education has also been accused of being disrespectful to certain families’ religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The Christian Post argued that if schools elect to teach about LGBT people while neglecting religious topics, the curriculum would be unfairly balanced.&lt;ref name="Christian Post" /&gt;

There have also been concerns that LGBT sex education wouldn’t be effective because it is difficult for homophobic students to accept homosexuality, which may prevent them from being receptive to the instruction.&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt;

=== Opposition within the United States ===
Four states (Alabama, South Carolina, Texas, Utah) mandate pointedly negative messages regarding all LGBT identities, when sex education is provided.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education|title=Sex and HIV Education|date=2016-03-14|work=Guttmacher Institute|access-date=2017-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight states prohibit discussion of any topics deemed LGBT-related.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to the Guttmacher Institute's findings in 2017, "If HIV education is taught in Arizona it cannot "promote" a "homosexual lifestyle" or portray homosexuality in a positive manner. Mandated HIV education in Oklahoma teaches that among other behaviors that 'homosexual activity' is considered to be 'responsible for contact with the AIDS virus'."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Croatian textbook===
In 2009, the European Committee of Social Rights found several statements in a Croatian mandatory Biology course textbook, including: “Many individuals are prone to sexual relations with persons of the same sex…. It is believed that parents are to blame because they impede their children’s correct sexual development with their irregularities in family relations. Nowadays it has become evident that homosexual relations are the main culprit for increased spreading of sexually transmitted diseases (e.g. AIDS),” and “The disease [AIDS] has spread amongst promiscuous groups of people who often change their sexual partners. Such people are homosexuals because of sexual contacts with numerous partners, drug addicts...and prostitutes.” The European Committee of Social Rights deemed these statements discriminatory and in violation of Croatia's obligations under the [[European Social Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/socialcharter/Complaints/CC45Merits_en.pdf|title=The European Social Charter|website=European Social Charter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=August 2007}}
[[File:Linné-Systema Naturae 1735.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The title page of ''Systema Naturae'', Leiden (1735)]]

'''Linnaean taxonomy''' can mean either of two related concepts: 
# the particular form of [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]] (taxonomy) set up by [[Carl Linnaeus]], as set forth in his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735) and subsequent works. In the taxonomy of Linnaeus there are three kingdoms, divided into ''classes'', and they, in turn, into ''orders'', ''genera'' (singular: ''genus''), and ''species'' (singular: ''species''), with an additional rank lower than species.
# a term for rank-based classification of organisms, in general. That is, taxonomy in the traditional sense of the word: rank-based [[scientific classification]]. This term is especially used as opposed to [[cladistics|cladistic]] systematics, which groups organisms into [[clade]]s. It is attributed to Linnaeus, although he neither invented the concept of ranked classification (it goes back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]) nor gave it its present form. In fact, it does not have an exact present form, as "Linnaean taxonomy" as such does not really exist: it is a collective (abstracting) term for what actually are several separate fields, which use similar approaches.

'''Linnaean name''' also has two meanings: depending on the context, it may either refer to a formal name given by Linnaeus (personally), such as [[Giraffa camelopardalis|''Giraffa camelopardalis'' Linnaeus, 1758]], or a formal name in the accepted nomenclature (as opposed to a modernistic [[clade]] name).

== The taxonomy of Linnaeus ==
In his ''Imperium Naturae'', Linnaeus established three kingdoms, namely ''Regnum Animale'', ''Regnum Vegetabile'' and ''Regnum Lapideum''. This approach, the Animal, Vegetable and Mineral Kingdoms, survives today in the popular mind, notably in the form of the parlour game question: "Is it [[animal, vegetable or mineral]]?". The work of Linnaeus had a huge impact on science; it was indispensable as a foundation for [[biological nomenclature]], now regulated by the [[nomenclature codes]]. Two of his works, the first edition of the ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (1753) for plants and the tenth edition of the ''Systema Naturae'' (1758), are accepted as part of the starting points of nomenclature; his binomials (names for species) and generic names take priority over those of others. However, the impact he had on science was not because of the value of his taxonomy.

=== Classification for plants ===
His classes and orders of plants, according to his ''Systema Sexuale'', were never intended to represent natural groups (as opposed to his [[ordo naturalis|''ordines naturales'']] in his ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]'') but only for use in identification. They were used for that purpose well into the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Comstock, J.L.|year=1837 |title= An introduction to the study of botany: including a treatise on vegetable physiology, and descriptions of the most common plants in the middle and northern states |publisher=Robinson, Pratt &amp; Co.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QHnvAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within each class were several orders.

[[File:Kalmia latifolia Great Smoky.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Kalmia]]'' is classified according to  Linnaeus' sexual system in class Decandria, order Monogyna, because it has 10 [[stamen]]s and one [[pistil]]]]

The Linnaean classes for plants, in the Sexual System, were: 
* Classis 1. Monandria: flowers with 1 stamen
* Classis 2. Diandria: flowers with 2 stamens
* Classis 3. Triandria: flowers with 3 stamens
* Classis 4. Tetrandria: flowers with 4 stamens
* Classis 5. Pentandria: flowers with 5 stamens
* Classis 6. Hexandria: flowers with 6 stamens
** Hexandria monogynia pp.&amp;nbsp;285–352{{sfn|Linnaeus|1753|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/358106#page/297/mode/1up Hexandria monogynia pp.&amp;nbsp;285–352]}}

* Classis 7. Heptandria: flowers with 7 stamens
* Classis 8. Octandria: flowers with 8 stamens
* Classis 9. Enneandria: flowers with 9 stamens
* Classis 10. Decandria: flowers with 10 stamens
* Classis 11. Dodecandria: flowers with 12 stamens
* Classis 12. Icosandria: flowers with 20 (or more) stamens, [[Ovary (plants)#Half-inferior ovary|perigynous]]
* Classis 13. Polyandria: flowers with many stamens, inserted on the [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]]
* Classis 14. Didynamia: flowers with 4 stamens, 2 long and 2 short
* Classis 15. Tetradynamia: flowers with 6 stamens, 4 long and 2 short
* Classis 16. Monadelphia; flowers with the anthers separate, but the filaments united, at least at the base
* Classis 17. Diadelphia; flowers with the stamens united in two separate groups
* Classis 18. Polyadelphia; flowers with the stamens united in several separate groups
* Classis 19. Syngenesia; flowers with stamens united by their anthers
* Classis 20. Gynandria; flowers with the stamens united to the pistils
* Classis 21. Monoecia: [[monoecious]] plants
* Classis 22. Dioecia: [[dioecious]] plants
* Classis 23. Polygamia: [[Plant sexual morphology#Plant population|polygamodioecious]] plants
* Classis 24. Cryptogamia: the "flowerless" plants, including [[fern]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], [[algae]], and [[bryophyte]]s

The classes based on the number of stamens were then subdivided by the number of pistils, e.g. ''Hexandria monogynia'' with six stamens and one pistil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linnaeus Sexual System|url=http://cronklab.wikidot.com/linnaeus-sexual-system|website=CronkLab|publisher=Biodiversity Research Centre, University of British Columbia|accessdate=26 January 2015|ref={{harvid|Linnaeus Sexual System|2015}}}}

=== Classification for animals ===
[[File:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png|thumb|400px|The 1735 classification of animals]]

Only in the Animal Kingdom is the higher taxonomy of Linnaeus still more or less recognizable and some of these names are still in use, but usually not quite for the same groups. He divided the Animal Kingdom into six classes, in the tenth edition, of 1758, these were:
* Classis 1. [[Mammalia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Mammalia]]
* Classis 2. [[Aves in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Aves]]
* Classis 3. [[Amphibia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Amphibia]]
* Classis 4. [[Pisces in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Pisces]]
* Classis 5. [[Insecta in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Insecta]]
* Classis 6. [[Vermes in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Vermes]]

=== Classification for minerals ===
His taxonomy of [[mineral]]s has long since dropped from use. In the tenth edition, 1758, of the ''Systema Naturae'', the Linnaean classes were:

* Classis 1. Petræ
* Classis 2. Mineræ
* Classis 3. Fossilia
* Classis 4. Vitamentra

== Rank-based scientific classification ==
{{Main|Taxonomy (biology)}}

This rank-based method of classifying living organisms was originally popularized by (and much later named for) Linnaeus, although it has changed considerably since his time. The greatest innovation of Linnaeus, and still the most important aspect of this system, is the general use of [[binomial nomenclature]], the combination of a [[genus]] name and a second term, which together uniquely identify each [[species]] of organism within a kingdom. For example, the [[human]] species is uniquely identified within the animal kingdom by the name ''Homo sapiens''. No other species of animal can have this same [[binomen]] (the technical term for a binomial in the case of animals). Prior to Linnaean taxonomy, animals were classified according to their mode of movement.

Linnaeus's use of binomial nomenclature was anticipated by the theory of definition used in [[Scholasticism]]. Scholastic logicians and philosophers of nature defined the species man, for example, as ''Animal rationalis'', where ''animal'' was considered a genus and ''rationalis'' (Latin for "rational") the characteristic distinguishing man from all other animals. Treating ''animal'' as the immediate genus of the species man, horse, etc. is of little practical use to the biological taxonomist, however. Accordingly, Linnaeus's classification treats ''animal'' as a class including many genera (subordinated to the animal "kingdom" via intermediary classes such as "orders"), and treats ''homo'' as the genus of a species ''Homo sapiens'', with ''sapiens'' (Latin for "knowing" or "understanding") playing a differentiating role analogous to that played, in the Scholastic system, by ''rationalis'' (the word ''homo'', Latin for "human being", was used by the Scholastics to denote a species, not a genus).

A strength of Linnaean taxonomy is that it can be used to organize the different kinds of living [[organism]]s, simply and practically. Every species can be given a unique (and, one hopes, stable) name, as compared with common names that are often neither unique nor consistent from place to place and language to language. This uniqueness and stability are, of course, a result of the acceptance by working [[Systematics|systematists]] (biologists specializing in taxonomy), not merely of the binomial names themselves, but of the rules governing the use of these names, which are laid down in formal [[nomenclature code]]s.

Species can be placed in a [[taxonomic rank|ranked]] [[hierarchy]], starting with either ''[[Domain (biology)|domains]]'' or ''kingdoms''. Domains are divided into [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]. Kingdoms are divided into ''[[phylum|phyla]]'' (singular: ''phylum'') &amp;mdash; for [[animal]]s; the term ''division'', used for [[plant]]s and [[fungi]], is equivalent to the rank of phylum (and the current [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] allows the use of either term). Phyla (or divisions) are divided into ''[[Class (biology)|classes]]'', and they, in turn, into ''[[Order (biology)|orders]]'', ''[[Family (biology)|families]]'', ''[[genus|genera]]'' (singular: ''genus''), and ''[[species]]'' (singular: ''species''). There are ranks below species: in zoology, ''subspecies'' (but see ''[[form (zoology)|form]]'' or ''[[morph (zoology)|morph]]''); in botany, ''variety'' (varietas) and ''form'' (forma), etc.

Groups of organisms at any of these ranks are called ''taxa'' (singular: ''[[taxon]]'') or ''taxonomic groups''.

The Linnaean system has proven robust and it remains the only extant working classification system at present that enjoys universal scientific acceptance. However, although the number of ranks is unlimited, in practice any classification becomes more cumbersome the more ranks are added. Among the later subdivisions that have arisen are such entities as phyla, families, and tribes, as well as any number of ranks with prefixes (superfamilies, subfamilies, etc.). The use of newer taxonomic tools such as [[cladistics]] and [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] has led to a different way of looking at evolution (expressed in many nested [[clade]]s) and this sometimes leads to a desire for more ranks. An example of such complexity is the [[Mammal classification#McKenna.2FBell classification|scheme for mammals]] proposed by McKenna and Bell.

=== Alternatives ===
Over time, the understanding of the relationships between living things has changed. Linnaeus could only base his scheme on the structural similarities of the different organisms. The greatest change was the widespread acceptance of [[evolution]] as the mechanism of biological diversity and species formation, following the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. It then became generally understood that classifications ought to reflect the [[phylogeny]] of organisms, their descent by evolution. This led to [[evolutionary taxonomy]], where the various [[extant taxon|extant]] and [[extinction|extinct]] are linked together to construct a phylogeny. This is largely what is meant by the term 'Linnaean taxonomy' when used in a modern context.

In [[cladistics]], originating in the work of [[Willi Hennig]], 1950 onwards, each taxon is grouped so as to include the common ancestor of the group's members (and thus to avoid [[polyphyly]]). Such taxa may be either [[monophyly|monophyletic]] (including all descendants) such as genus ''[[Homo]]'', or [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] (excluding some descendants), such as genus ''[[Australopithecus]]''.

Originally, Linnaeus established three kingdoms in his scheme, namely for [[Plant]]s, [[Animal]]s and an additional group for [[minerals]], which has long since been abandoned.  Since then, various life forms have been moved into three new kingdoms: [[Monera]], for [[prokaryote]]s (i.e., bacteria); [[Protist]]a, for protozoans and most algae; and [[fungus|Fungi]].  This five kingdom scheme is still far from the [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] ideal and has largely been supplanted in modern taxonomic work by a division into three domains: [[Bacterium|Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]], which contain the prokaryotes, and [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]], comprising the remaining forms. These arrangements should not be seen as definitive. They are based on the [[genome]]s of the organisms; as knowledge on this increases, classifications will change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Embley, T. A.  |author2=Martin, W. |lastauthoramp=yes|date=2006 |title=Eukaryotic evolution, changes and challenges. |journal=Nature |volume=440 |pages=623–630 |doi=10.1038/nature04546 |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/eukaryotic-evolution-changes-and-challenges-13997647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representing presumptive evolutionary relationships, especially given the wide acceptance of [[cladistic]] methodology and numerous [[molecular phylogenetic|molecular phylogenies]] that have challenged long-accepted classifications, within the framework of Linnaean taxonomy, is sometimes seen as problematic. Therefore, some systematists have proposed a [[PhyloCode]] to replace it.

'''Lithium toxicity''', also known as '''lithium overdose''' and '''lithium poisoning''', is the condition of having too much lithium in the blood. This condition also happens in persons that are taking lithium in which the lithium levels are affected by [[Drug interaction|drug interactions]] in the body.

The toxicity falls into 3 categories: [[Acute (medicine)|acute]], [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]], and acute on chronic. Acute toxicity is a single ingestion, without prior exposure to lithium. This includes events such as a child who unintentionally ingests the drug or intentional self-harm ingestion, without previous exposure to the drug. Chronic toxicity occurs in people who accumulate high levels during ongoing therapy. Acute on chronic occurs in persons in ongoing therapy with an acute ingestion of excessive amounts either accidentally or intentionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hedya|first=Shireen A.|title=Lithium Toxicity|date=2018|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499992/|work=StatPearls|publisher=StatPearls Publishing|pmid=29763168|access-date=2018-10-30|last2=Swoboda|first2=Henry D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
When lithium overdoses produce neurological deficits or cardiac toxicity, the symptoms are considered serious and can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, J. B., Klaassen, C. D., &amp; Casarett, L. J. (2010). ''Casarett &amp; Doulls essentials of toxicology''. Place of publication not identified: McGraw Hill Medical.&lt;/ref&gt; The severity of the symptoms is graded with lithium concentration on the range of mild, moderate, and severe. The normal serum lithium concentration should be between 0.6-1. Mild intoxication is defined as lithium concentration between 1.5-2.5 mEq/L. Moderate intoxication is serum lithium concentration between 2.5-3.5 mEq/L. Severe intoxication occurs with serum lithium concentration greater than 3.5 mEq/L. Severe intoxication presents with [[coma]], [[hyperthermia]], and [[hypotension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hedya|first=Shireen A.|title=Lithium Toxicity|date=2018|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499992/|work=StatPearls|publisher=StatPearls Publishing|pmid=29763168|access-date=2018-10-30|last2=Swoboda|first2=Henry D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acute toxicity ===
In acute toxicity, people have primarily gastrointestinal symptoms such as [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]], which may result in [[Hypovolemia|volume depletion]]. During acute toxicity, lithium distributes later into the central nervous system causing dizziness and other mild neurological symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gitlin|first=Michael|date=2016-12-17|title=Lithium side effects and toxicity: prevalence and management strategies|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5164879/|journal=International Journal of Bipolar Disorders|volume=4|issue=1|pages=27|doi=10.1186/s40345-016-0068-y|issn=2194-7511|pmc=5164879|pmid=27900734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chronic toxicity ===
In chronic toxicity, people have primarily neurological symptoms which include include [[nystagmus]], [[tremor]], [[hyperreflexia]], [[ataxia]], and [[Delirium|change in mental status]]. During chronic toxicity, the gastrointestinal symptoms seen in acute toxicity are less prominent. The symptoms are often vague and nonspecific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Netto|first=Ivan|last2=Phutane|first2=Vivek H.|date=2012|title=Reversible Lithium Neurotoxicity: Review of the Literature|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3357580/|journal=The Primary Care Companion for CNS Disorders|volume=14|issue=1|doi=10.4088/PCC.11r01197|issn=2155-7772|pmc=3357580|pmid=22690368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Lithium is readily absorbed from the [[gastrointestinal tract]].&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, J. B., Klaassen, C. D., &amp; Casarett, L. J. (2010). ''Casarett &amp; Doulls essentials of toxicology''. Place of publication not identified: McGraw Hill Medical.&lt;/ref&gt; It is distributed to the body with higher levels in the kidney, [[thyroid]], and bone as compared to other tissues. Since lithium is almost exclusively excreted by the [[Kidney|kidneys]], people with preexisting [[Chronic kidney disease|renal insufficiency]] are at high risk of developing lithium intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haussmann|first=R.|last2=Bauer|first2=M.|last3=von Bonin|first3=S.|last4=Grof|first4=P.|last5=Lewitzka|first5=U.|date=2015-10-22|title=Treatment of lithium intoxication: facing the need for evidence|journal=International Journal of Bipolar Disorders|language=En|volume=3|issue=1|pages=23|doi=10.1186/s40345-015-0040-2|issn=2194-7511|pmc=4615994|pmid=26493348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lithium toxicity can be mistaken for other syndromes associated with antipsychotic use, such as [[serotonin syndrome]] because lithium increases [[serotonin]] metabolites in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shahani|first=Lokesh|title=Venlafaxine Augmentation With Lithium Leading to Serotonin Syndrome|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|language=en|volume=24|issue=3|pages=E47|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11080196|pmid=23037683|issn=0895-0172|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several drug interactions with lithium. Interactions can occur from [[Typical antipsychotic|typical antipsychotics]] or [[Atypical antipsychotic|atypical antipsyhcotics]]. In particular, certain drugs enhance lithium levels by increasing renal re-absorption at the proximal tubule. These drugs are [[ACE inhibitor|angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors]], [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] and [[Thiazide|thiazide diuretics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haussmann|first=R.|last2=Bauer|first2=M.|last3=von Bonin|first3=S.|last4=Grof|first4=P.|last5=Lewitzka|first5=U.|date=2015-10-22|title=Treatment of lithium intoxication: facing the need for evidence|journal=International Journal of Bipolar Disorders|language=En|volume=3|issue=1|pages=23|doi=10.1186/s40345-015-0040-2|issn=2194-7511|pmc=4615994|pmid=26493348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
When lithium toxicity is suspected are, the common laboratory tests are:  

*[[Blood glucose monitoring|fingerstick glucose]]
* serum lithium concentration 
*[[basic metabolic panel]] to assess renal function
* serum [[acetaminophen]] and [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]] concentrations to rule out other sources of acute ingestion
*[[Pregnancy test|urine pregnancy tests]] to ensure management does not cause [[abortion]]

Imaging tests are not helpful. 

== Treatment ==
If the person's lithium toxicity is mild or moderate, lithium dosage is reduced or stopped entirely. If the toxicity is severe, lithium may need to be removed from your body. The removal of lithium is done in a [[hospital]] [[emergency department]]. It may involve:

*[[Gastric lavage]]. A tube is placed through the nose or mouth into the stomach. The tube is used to remove lithium that has not been digested yet. It may also be used to put medicines directly into the stomach to help stop lithium from being absorbed.
* Medicines that increase removal of lithium by the kidneys.
*[[Hemodialysis|Use of an artificial kidney to clean the blood]] (''dialysis''). This is usually done only in the most severe cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waring|first=W.

{{homicide}}
 
A '''lust murder''' is a [[homicide]] in which the offender searches for erotic satisfaction by killing someone. ''Lust murder'' is synonymous with the [[paraphilic]] term '''erotophonophilia''', which is [[sexual arousal]] or gratification contingent on the death of a human being. The phrase "lust killing" stems from the original work of [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] in his 1898 discussion of [[sexual sadism|sadistic]] homicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Homicide: A Psychiatric Perspective|last = Malmquist|first = Carl P.|publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc.|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, this type of crime is manifested either by murder during [[sexual activity]], by [[Mutilation|mutilating]] the [[sexual organ]]s or areas of the victim's body, or by murder and mutilation. The mutilation of the victim may include [[Disembowelment|evisceration]], displacement of the sexual organs, or both.&lt;ref name="aggrawal"&gt;{{cite book | first=Anil | last=Aggrawal | coauthors= | title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices | publisher=[[CRC Press]] | location=Boca Raton | year=2009 | isbn=1-4200-4308-0 |url=http://crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781420043082}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mutilation usually takes place postmortem.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2010" /&gt; Although the killing sequence may include an act of sexual intercourse, sexual intercourse does not always occur, and other types of sexual acts may be part of the homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Homicide: A Psychiatric Perspective|last = Malmquist|first = Carl P.|publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc.|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Characteristics==
Lust murder sometimes includes activities such as removing clothing from the body, posing and propping of the body in different positions (generally sexual ones), insertion of objects into bodily orifices, [[Cannibalism|anthropophagy]] (the consumption of human blood and/or flesh) and [[necrophilia]] (the performing of sex acts on a human corpse).

Most cases of lust murder involve male perpetrators, although accounts of female lust murderers do exist.&lt;ref name="Female_Lust_Kill"&gt;{{cite news|title=When Women Kill Together. |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1613/is_1_16/ai_n29335603/ |work=The Forensic Examiner |publisher=American College of Forensic Examiners Institute (ACFEI) |date=2007-03-22 |accessdate=2009-08-08 |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829110653/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1613/is_1_16/ai_n29335603/ |archivedate=2010-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, lust murder is a phenomenon most common among [[serial killers]]. These offenders have made a connection between murder and sexual gratification. When this type of offender chooses a victim there must be something about that victim that the offender finds sexually attractive. This attractive trait might be common among all of the offender's victims and is called the offender's Ideal Victim Type (IVT). There might be many potential targets that an offender passes by because they do not meet their IVT. Once the offender has found a victim who is ideal, they might engage in stalking or other predatory behaviors before acting out their fantasy on their victim. Fantasies are a key component in lust murders and can never be completely fulfilled. The lust killer will have a fantasy that continues to evolve over time and becomes increasingly violent as they struggle to fulfill it.&lt;ref name="Holmes &amp; Holmes"&gt;{{cite book | first1=Ronald | last1=Holmes | first2= Stephen | last2=Holmes | title=Serial Murder (3rd edition) | publisher=[[Sage Publications]] | location=Thousand Oaks, CA | year=2010 | pages=107–121 |isbn=978-1-4129-7442-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most critical component in the psychological development of a serial killer is violent fantasy, especially in the lust murderer.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2010"&gt;Hickey, Eric W. (2010). Serial Murderers and Their Victims (5th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasies accompany "intrusive thoughts about killing someone that are associated with other distressing [[psychopathological]] processes".&lt;ref&gt;Crabb, Peter B. (2000). The Material Culture of Homicidal Fantasies. Aggressive Behavior, 26, 225-234&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasies can never be completely fulfilled; sometimes the experience of killing can generate new fantasies of violence, creating a repetitive cycle. The purpose of fantasy is total control of the victim, whereas a [[sexual assault]] can be used as a vehicle for control. Sexual [[torture]] becomes a tool to degrade, humiliate, and subjugate the victim.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2010"/&gt; Often victims are selected by the killer to stand as a proxy, resulting from childhood trauma. Fantasies may be fueled by pornography and facilitated by alcohol or other causes.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2010"/&gt; Typically, fantasies involve one or several forms of [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref name="Holmes &amp; Holmes"/&gt;

The term ''lust murder'' is also used in a related, but slightly different sense, to refer to an individual who gains ''[[sexual arousal]]'' from the act of committing murder, or has persistent ''[[sexual fantasy|sexual fantasies]]'' of committing murder, even if the murder itself does not involve the genital mutilation or other aforementioned characteristics. As such, it is a type of [[paraphilia]].

Although the dynamic of violent fantasy in lust murders is understood, an individual's violence fantasy alone is not enough to determine if an individual has or has not engaged in lust murder. Moreover, to conclude that an individual is the murderer because they have drawn multitudes of violent images is overreaching.&lt;ref&gt;Perri, Frank S. and Lichtenwald, Terrance G. (2009). “[http://www.all-about-forensic-psychology.com/support-files/criminal-profiling.pdf When Worlds Collide: Criminal Investigative Analysis, Forensic Psychology And the Timothy Masters Case].” Forensic Examiner, 18:2 NCJ # 226972&lt;/ref&gt; The Perri and Lichtenwald article illustrates the critical importance of homicide detectives employing the Criminal Investigative Analysis model developed by Roy Hazelwood FBI (ret.), profiler and one of the top researchers in the field of lust murders.

In [[zoology]], '''mammalogy''' is the study of [[mammal]]s – a [[class (biology)|class]] of [[vertebrate]]s with characteristics such as [[homeotherm]]ic [[metabolism]], [[fur]], four-chambered [[heart]]s, and complex [[nervous system]]s. Mammalogy has also been known as "'''mastology'''," "'''theriology'''," and "'''therology'''." There are about 4,200 different species of mammals. The major branches of mammalogy include natural history, taxonomy and systematics, anatomy and physiology, ethology, ecology, and management and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/mammalogy|title=mammalogy {{!}} zoology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approximate salary of a mammalogist varies from $20,000 to $60,000 a year, depending on their experience.  Mammalogists are typically involved in activities such as conducting research, managing personnel, and writing proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mammalogist|url=http://www.aboutbioscience.org/careers/mammalogist|work=Bioscience Careers|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammalogy branches off into other taxonomically-oriented disciplines such as [[primatology]] (study of [[primates]]), and [[cetology]] (study of [[cetaceans]]). Like other studies, mammalogy is also  a part of zoology which is also a part of biology.

== List of mammalogy journals ==

This is a list of scientific journals broadly serving mammalogists. In addition, many other more general zoology, ecology and evolution, or conservation journals also deal with mammals, and several journals are specific to only certain taxonomic groups of mammals.

'''The McKnight Brain Institute''' (MBI) at the [[University of Florida]] is a research and teaching center, which conducts integrated Research in [[neuroscience]], [[neurology]], [[neurosurgery]], [[psychiatry]], [[cognitive science]], and related areas. The MBI is one of the nation’s most comprehensive and technologically advanced centers devoted to discovering how the normal brain operates, and how we can repair the brain following injury, disease, or aging.  The MBI has over 300 faculty from 50 Departments in the UF with current major research focuses including neurodegeneration (such as AD, PD, and ALS), age-related memory loss, brain and spinal cord injuries, brain tumors, and addiction.

The MBI at UF is the flagship of four McKnight Brain Institutes across the United States.  '''Dr. Tetsuo Ashizawa''' is the current '''Executive Director of the MBI'''.  Former Executive Directors include Dr. William G. Luttge, the founding Director, Dr. Douglass Anderson, and Dr. Dennis A. Steindler.

== History ==

Dr. Luttge joined UF in 1971 as an assistant professor of neuroscience in the College of Medicine after earning his Ph.D. in biological sciences at the University of California, Irvine. The neuroscience department at the College of Medicine was one of the first of its kind in the country, and Luttge quickly became its leader, researching the molecular and behavioral actions of steroids in the brain.

In December 1991, Luttge came across an excerpt from an obscure newsletter, ''Commerce Business Daily'', announcing a call for proposals for a competitive Department of Defense (DoD) grant to build a major national brain and spinal cord research center. Around the same time, the University of Florida (UF), through its Health Science Center, College of Medicine and its teaching hospital, Shands at UF, made a strategic decision to create a unique campus-wide program to enhance the multidisciplinary research, clinical care and educational skills of the entire university. This program was named the University of Florida Brain Institute (UFBI).

Newly appointed as director of UF’s Brain Institute, Luttge embarked on a logistical tour de force to meet all requirements of the grant application. The requirements, such as a $36,000,000 matching grant from UF, were soon met. And on June 11, 1992, UF had won the $18,000,000 grant, beating out several prestigious universities and neuroscience research centers.
Construction of the new institute building couldn’t be completed, however, until the Defense Department and Veterans Affairs awarded another $20,000,000 for the project in 1996 and 1997. On October 22, 1998,  The University of Florida officially opened the doors to its world-class, $60 million UF Brain Institute building.

The MBI-UF was renamed the '''Evelyn F. &amp; William L. McKnight Brain Institute''' of the University of Florida (MBI-UF) to celebrate and commemorate a $15,000,000 gift from the '''McKnight Brain Research Foundation'''. This award was the largest cash gift in UF history and it was matched by the State of Florida to help create over a $30,000,000 permanent endowment devoted to fundamental research on the mechanisms underlying the formation, storage and retrieval of memories, the impairments in these processes associated with aging, and the development of therapeutic strategies for the prevention and/or alleviation of these impairments in humans.

The '''National Dinosaur Museum''' is Australia's largest permanent display of prehistoric  specimens, located in Gold Creek Village near [[Canberra]], [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[Australia]]. The museum's exhibition follows the [[evolution]] of  life, with a particular focus on [[dinosaur]]s.

With an annual patronage of 100,000  visitors, the museum is one of the most popular attractions in the Australian Capital Territory. The gift shop stocks a range of natural history books, dinosaur replicas, toys, fossils, crystals, minerals and meteorites. 

Established in 1993, the museum has been steadily improved and updated since its conception. It offers earth science dinosaur oriented  displays that keep up with most recent discoveries  in the geological sciences. New directors have been appointed in September 2011 including local and  international scientists and geologists. Major upgrades have 
taken place in April and May 2012 with the addition of twelve [[animatronic]] dinosaurs as well as an extensive collection of life size models displayed both within and outside the museum.
The museum caters for guided tours for school groups of all ages by appointment, as well as hosting birthday parties, dance with dinosaurs events for young children, private parties, corporate functions and dinosaur sleep overs during school holiday periods. 
New displays of Australian dinosaurs,  earth sciences including meteorites, [[fluorescent mineral]] displays are planned for late 2012 and 2013.

Opening hours are 10am to 5 pm  seven days a week including public holidays, but are closed Christmas Day. After hours visits are available by appointment only .

'''Sir Donald Neil MacCormick''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|QC|FBA|FRSE}} (27 May 1941 – 5 April 2009) was a Scottish [[philosophy of law|legal philosopher]] and politician.  He was [[Regius Professor]] of Public Law and the Law of Nature and Nations at the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1972 until 2008.  He was a [[Member of the European Parliament]] 1999–2004, member of the [[Convention on the Future of Europe]], and officer of the [[Scottish National Party]].

== Life and Academic Career ==
MacCormick was born in [[Glasgow]] on 27 May 1941, the son of one of the SNP's founders, [[John MacCormick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/professor-sir-neil-maccormick-legal-academic-and-politician-1-1033072 |title=Professor Sir Neil MacCormick, Legal academic and politician |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the [[High School of Glasgow]]. He graduated [[MA (Scotland)|MA]] in Philosophy and English Literature at the [[University of Glasgow]], before benefiting from a [[Snell exhibition|Snell Exhibition]] and taking the BA in Jurisprudence at [[Balliol College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7GJAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mqMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4426%2C2497348 |title=Glasgow style and Oxford Manners |first=Neil |last=MacCormick |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |page=10 |date=15 February 1965 |accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Oxford, MacCormick came under the influence of Professor [[H. L. A. Hart]], and developed an interest in legal philosophy. In 1982 he was awarded the research degree of LLD by the [[University of Edinburgh]].

MacCormick was a lecturer in Jurisprudence at the School of Law, University of Dundee [which was attached to University of St Andrews at that time] from 1965-67. Following this, he was a Fellow and Tutor in Jurisprudence, Balliol College, Oxford 1968-1972, and thereafter held the Regius Chair of Public Law and the Law of Nature and Nations at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He was also Leverhulme Research Professor at Edinburgh from 1997–1999, and from 2004-2008. In addition, he held the position of Dean of Law Faculty between 1973–76 and was sometime Provost of the Faculty Group of Law and Social Science, and Vice-Principal for International Affairs.

Professor MacCormick retired from the Regius Chair on 1 February 2008 after completing 36 years as Professor (and later Senior Professor) at the University of Edinburgh. He was accorded with the honour of a series of lectures in his name by the University's [[University of Edinburgh School of Law|School of Law]], and delivered the School of Law's opening Tercentenary Lecture, introduced by former Lord President [[William Cullen, Baron Cullen of Whitekirk|Lord Cullen]], on 18 January 2007. He gave his final lecture as Regius Professor, entitled 'Just Law', on Monday 28 January 2008. He continued thereafter in his role as President of the International Association for [[Philosophy of Law]] and Social Philosophy.

He was president of the [[International Association for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12454642.Law_professor_still_doing_his_job_justice/|title=Law professor still doing his job justice |last=Dorsey|first=Kristy |date=10 December 2007 |work=The Herald |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacCormick was a member of the [[Broadcasting Council for Scotland]], of the [[Economic and Social Research Council]], of the Research Council of the [[European University Institute]], and of the [[European Science Foundation]], as well as of various government departmental committees inquiring into matters of public concern.

== Political career ==
MacCormick stood for the SNP in the [[Edinburgh Pentlands (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Pentlands]] constituency in [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987]], coming in fourth place both times. He stood for [[Argyll and Bute (UK Parliament constituency)|Argyll and Bute]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]] and came second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/results_constituencies/constituencies/016.stm |title=Vote 2001: Results &amp; Constituencies: Argyll &amp; Bute |work=BBC News |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1998 he was selected by delegates at the SNP's conference as a candidate for the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (United Kingdom)|1999 European Parliament elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/179343.stm |title=SNP chooses Euro candidates |work=[[BBC News]] |date=24 September 1998 |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a [[Member of the European Parliament]], taking a leave of absence from the University of Edinburgh. Professor MacCormick was a member of the [[Convention on the Future of Europe]] from 2002–3, drafting the proposed [[Constitutional Treaty for the European Union]]. He was voted Scottish Euro MP of the Year in 2001, 2002 and 2003 at the [[Scottish Politician of the Year]] Awards, and retired from elected office in 2004 to complete his Leverhulme Research Professorship at Edinburgh.

He was elected vice president of the SNP in 1999 and remained in the position until 2004.&lt;ref name="BBC 6 Apr2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7985544.stm |title=Prominent SNP figure dies aged 67 |publisher=BBC News |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 MacCormick was appointed as a special advisor on Europe to the [[Government of the 3rd Scottish Parliament|newly elected SNP-led]] [[Scottish Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6704673.stm |title=Advocate becomes Salmond adviser |work=BBC News |date=30 May 2007 |accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic works ==
MacCormick wrote numerous journal articles and books, concentrating both on Law in a European context and the philosophy of law. Works such as ''Legal Right and Social Democracy: Essays in Legal and Political Philosophy'' (1984), ''Legal Reasoning and Legal Theory'' (1978), ''Rhetoric and The Rule of Law'' (2005) and ''Institutions of Law'' (2007) all convey his particular brand of legal philosophy. ''Legal Reasoning and Legal Theory'' answers many of the [[Ronald Dworkin|Dworkin]]ian critiques of the [[H. L. A. Hart|Hart]]ian conception of law, and it is seen by some as showing a middle ground between the two. His final book was ''Practical Reason in Law and Morality'' (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Natural Law, Practical Reason and Autonomous Persons — A Critical Review of Neil MacCormick: Practical Reason in Law and Morality. |first=Jes |last=Bjarup |journal=[[Archiv für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie]] (ARSP) (Archives for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy) |volume=95 |number=3 |date=2009 |pages=428–439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==
In 1999, MacCormick was appointed [[Queen's Counsel]] 'honoris causa', and was knighted in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] in 2001 in recognition of services to scholarship in Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2001/birthday_honours_2001/1391003.stm |title=Birthday honours 2001: Honours in Scotland |work=BBC News |date=15 June 2001|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 he was a recipient of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Royal Society of Edinburgh's]] Royal Gold Medal for Outstanding Achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/royal-medal-awards-1-551717|title=Royal Medal awards |work=The Scotsman |date=3 September 2004 |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the recipient of honorary degrees from [[Queen’s University]] (Canada), [[Uppsala University]] (Sweden), [[University of Macerata]] (Italy) and [[Saarland University]] (Germany), as well as from Glasgow University, [[Queen Margaret University]] and the University of Edinburgh.

==Illness and death==
Just after retiring from his chair at the University of Edinburgh in 2008, MacCormick was diagnosed with inoperable cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pendreigh |first=Brian |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/premiere-brings-stone-of-destiny-home-to-dying-son-of-king-john-1-1438189 |title=Premiere brings Stone of Destiny home to dying son of 'King John' |publisher=[[The Scotsman]] |date=5 October 2008 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2208">The '''''opus gallicum''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "Gallic work") was a technique of construction whereby precise holes were created in stone masonry for the insertion of wooden beams to create a wooden infrastructure. The technique was so named because, though its presence is attested in protohistoric times, its use was common enough in [[Gaul]] to merit mention in [[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's]] ''[[De Bello Gallico|De bello Gallico]]'' and was frequently employed in the [[Merovingian]] era. The technique was imported by the [[Normans]] into the [[Molise]], where it was used extensively in the raising of [[castle]]s in a short time. Gaulish masons are even known to have brought the technique from Merovingian Francia to [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[England]] during the 7th and 8th centuries and employed it in [[church architecture]]. 

The ''opus gallicum'' served not only as an infrastructural base, but also a [[Superstructure|superstructural]] binding element designed to strengthen the masonry. While the arrangement of some of the holes found in preserved structures is often perplexing, leaving doubt as to the exact function of the beams, modern scholarship has largely moved away from the theory that the ''opus gallicum'' was a rare and inefficient method. Overall the technique was not uncommon in the Middle Ages.

The term '''physiological prematurity''' refers to the fact that compared to most animals, humans are born in a premature biological state. Although [[sensory organs]] and skeletal and muscular systems are largely developed prenatally, human babies at the time of their [[birth]] are completely helpless and dependent on intensive care. This is in contrast to the maturity at birth found in other higher [[mammals]] (e.g. elephants, horses). 
According to the Swiss biologist [[Adolf Portmann]], it is a characteristic feature of humans that due to their early birth, many developmental processes do not happen in isolation, but embedded in a sociocultural environment. Due to their complete dependence, humans are particularly amenable for social interactions and their environmental condition, which, according to Portmann, is a precondition for cultural and intellectual learning.

In [[computer graphics]], '''planar''' is the method of representing [[pixel]] colors with several ''[[bit plane|bitplanes]]'' of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]]. Each bit in a bitplane is related to one pixel on the screen. Unlike [[Packed pixel|chunky]], [[high color]], or [[Color depth#True color (24-bit) | true color]] graphics, the whole dataset for an individual pixel isn't in one specific location in RAM, but spread across the bitplanes that make up the display.

This scheme originated in the early days of computer graphics. The memory [[Integrated circuit|chips]] of this era can not supply data fast enough on their own to generate a picture on a TV screen or monitor from a large [[framebuffer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | page = 13
 | isbn = 0-07-053534-5 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; By splitting the data up into multiple planes, each plane can be stored on a separate memory chip. These chips can then be read in parallel at a slower rate, allowing graphical display on modest hardware. The [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] video adapter on early [[IBM PC]] computers uses planar arrangement in color graphical modes for this reason. The later [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] includes [[Mode 13h|one non-planar mode]] which sacrifices memory efficiency for more convenient access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.osdev.org/VGA_Hardware|title=VGA Hardware - OSDev Wiki|website=wiki.osdev.org|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diagram of planar computer graphics.svg|thumb|Combining four one-bit planes into a final "four bits per pixel" (16-color) image]]
For example, on a [[Packed pixel|chunky]] display, each byte represents one pixel. Three pixels in a row are stored as follows, where up to 256 different colors are available:

{|class="wikitable"
! Byte index || 0 || 1 || 2
|-
| Value (binary) || 00000000 || 00000001 || 00000010
|-
| Value (decimal) || 0 || 1 || 2
|-
| Resulting pixel
|style="background-color: #000000; color: white;"| Black
|style="background-color: #0000A8; color: white;"| Blue
|style="background-color: #00A800; color: white;"| Green
|}

Whereas a planar data store could use 2 bitplanes, providing for a 4 color display:

{|class="wikitable"
! Byte index ||colspan=8| 0
|-
! Bit index || 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7
|-
| Plane 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
| Plane 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
| Resulting pixel
|style="background-color: #0000A8; color: white;"| 1
|style="background-color: #000000; color: white;"| 0
|style="background-color: #000000; color: white;"| 0
|style="background-color: #00A800; color: white;"| 2
|style="background-color: #000000; color: white;"| 0
|style="background-color: #000000; color: white;"| 0
|style="background-color: #00A8A8; color: white;"| 3
|style="background-color: #000000; color: white;"| 0
|-
| Byte value ||colspan=8 style="text-align: center;"| 146
|}

Adding a third plane makes 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=8 colors available. Where fewer than 256 colors are needed, planar graphics are more economical in RAM compared with 8-bit chunky graphics, as there are no unused bits in a given byte.

A disadvantage of planar graphics is that more RAM address cycles are needed for [[scrolling]] and [[animation]]s, although these operations can be made faster by dedicated hardware such as the [[blitter]] chips used in [[Amiga]] and some later [[Atari ST]] computers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The '''posterior compartment of the thigh''' is one of the [[fascial compartments of thigh|fascial compartments]] that contains the [[knee]] [[anatomical terms of motion#flexion|flexors]] and [[hip]] [[anatomical terms of motion#extension|extensors]] known as the [[hamstring muscles]], as well as vascular and nervous elements, particularly the [[sciatic nerve]].

==Structure==

The posterior compartment is a [[fascial compartment]] bounded by [[fascia]]. It is separated from the [[anterior compartment of thigh|anterior compartment]] by two folds of [[fascia lata|deep fascia]], known as the [[Medial intermuscular septum of thigh|medial intermuscular septum]] and the [[Lateral intermuscular septum of thigh|lateral intermuscular septum]].&lt;ref&gt;http://anatomy.uams.edu/topogr_lowerlimb.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The muscles of the posterior compartment of the thigh are the:&lt;ref name="isbn0-7817-5484-4"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sauerland, Eberhardt K. |author2=Patrick W. Tank |author3=Tank, Patrick W. |title=Grant's dissector |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2005 |pages=133 |isbn=0-7817-5484-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="titleSummary of Lower Limb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/WNOR/summarylistll.htm |title=Summary of Lower Limb |accessdate=2008-01-27 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123061508/http://mywebpages.comcast.net/WNOR/summarylistll.htm |archivedate=2008-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[biceps femoris muscle]], which consists of a short head and a long head.
* [[semitendinosus muscle]]
* [[semimembranosus muscle]]

These muscles (or their tendons) apart from the short head of the biceps femoris, are commonly known as the [[hamstring]]s. The depression at the back of the knee, or ''kneepit'' is the [[popliteal fossa]], colloquially called the ''ham''. The tendons of the above muscles can be felt as prominent cords on both sides of the fossa—the biceps femoris tendon on the lateral side and the semimembranosus and semitendinosus tendons on the medial side. The hamstrings flex the knee, and aided by the gluteus maximus, they extend the hip during walking and running. The semitendinosus is named for its unusually long tendon.  The semimembranosus is named for the flat shape of its superior attachment.&lt;ref name="isbn978-0077351144"&gt;{{cite book |author=Saladin, Kenneth S. |title=Anatomy and Physiology the Unity of Form and Function. |publisher=McGraw Hill Higher Education |location=Boston, MA |year=2012 |pages=133 |isbn=978-0077351144 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innervation===
The hamstrings are innervated by the sciatic nerve, specifically by a main branch of it: the [[tibial nerve]]. (The short head of the biceps femoris is innervated by the [[common fibular nerve]]). The sciatic nerve runs along the longitudinal axis of the compartment, giving the cited terminal branches close to the superior angle of the popliteal fossa.

===Blood supply===
The arteries that supply the posterior compartment of the thigh arise from the [[inferior gluteal artery|inferior gluteal]] and the perforating branches of the [[profunda femoris artery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.comcast.net/~wnor/postthigh.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906031147/http://home.comcast.net/~wnor/postthigh.htm |archivedate=2012-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a major collateral branch of the femoral artery and part of the [[anterior compartment of thigh]]. The femoral artery itself crosses the [[adductor hiatus]] to enter the posterior compartment at the level of the popliteal fossa, giving branches that supply the knee. This crossing marks the point in which the vessel changes its name to [[popliteal artery]].

==Clinical significance==

As with any other fascial compartment, the posterior compartment of thigh can develop [[compartment syndrome]] when pressure builds up inside it, reducing the ability of arteries to transport blood to muscles and nerves. In acute cases, this is most frequently a consequence of trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ojike NI, Roberts CS, Giannoudis PV |date=2010 |title=Compartment syndrome of the thigh: a systematic review |url=http://www.injuryjournal.com/article/S0020-1383%2809%2900213-7/fulltext |journal=Injury |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=133–136  |doi=10.1016/j.injury.2009.03.016 |pmid=19555950 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18217">In [[astronomy]], '''precovery''' (short for '''pre-discovery recovery''')&lt;ref name="McNaught" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AANEAS" /&gt; is the process of finding the image of an object in old archived images or [[photographic plates]] for the purpose of calculating a more accurate [[orbit]]. This happens most often with [[minor planet]]s, but sometimes a [[comet]], a [[dwarf planet]], a [[natural satellite]], or a [[star]] is found in old archived images; even [[extrasolar planet|exoplanet]] precovery observations have been obtained.&lt;ref name="HST-exoplanet" /&gt; While the term "precovery" refers to a pre-discovery image, "recovery" refers to imaging of a body which was lost to our view (as behind the Sun), but is now visible again ''(also see [[Lost minor planet]]s and [[Lost comet]]s)''.

Calculating the orbit of an astronomical object involves measuring its position on multiple occasions. The more widely separated these are in time, the more accurately the orbit can be calculated. However, for a newly discovered object, only a few days' or weeks' worth of measured positions may be available, which is only sufficient for a preliminary (imprecise) orbit calculation.

When an object is of particular interest (such as [[asteroid]]s with a chance of [[impact event|impacting Earth]]), researchers begin a search for precovery images. Using the preliminary orbit calculation to predict where the object might appear on old archival images, those images (sometimes decades old) are searched to see if it had been in fact photographed already. If so, a far more precise orbital calculation can then be made.

Until fast computers were widely available, it was impractical to analyze and measure images for possible minor planet discoveries because this involved a considerable amount of manual labor. Usually, such images were made years or decades earlier for other purposes (studies of [[galaxy|galaxies]], etc.), and it was not worth the time it took to look for precovery images of ordinary asteroids. Today, computers can easily analyze digital astronomical images and compare them to [[star catalog]]s containing up to a [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] or so star positions to see if one of the "stars" is actually a precovery image of the newly discovered object. This technique has been used since the mid-1990s to determine the orbits of an enormous number of minor planets.
----In a broad spectrum of global impact solutions and sectors for systemic change and preparation, '''precovery''' (short for '''pre-recovery''') is defined in the following way:

# “The necessary planning and prevention to reduce ill effects of natural and/or man-made shocks or stresses and to preemptively speed the return to a normal state or condition of health, mind, being or strength, particularly within human communities and natural habitat.”
# “The action or process of networking data, solutions, planning and investments, removing silos and weaving together practitioners and practice in mitigation, adaptation, community planning, sustainability, recovery, resilience and storytelling.”    

'''Precovery''' and the related '''precovery mindset''' are an overall practice that goes beyond holistic resilience at the basic community level and asks practitioners, leaders and citizens to examine diverse long-term aspects that affect both the built environment and the natural environment, as well the individual or family level.

== Examples ==

In an extreme case of precovery, an object was discovered on December 31, 2000, designated {{mpl|2000 YK|66}}, and a near-Earth orbit was calculated. Precovery revealed that it had previously been discovered on February 23, 1950 and given the [[provisional designation]] 1950 DA, and then been lost for half a century. The exceptionally long [[Observation arc|observation period]] allowed an unusually precise orbit calculation, and the asteroid was determined to have a small chance of colliding with the Earth. After an asteroid's orbit is calculated with sufficient precision, it can be assigned a number (in this case, [[(29075) 1950 DA]]).

The asteroid [[69230 Hermes]] was found in 2003 and numbered, but was found to be a discovery from 1937 which had even been named, but subsequently lost. Consequently, its old name "Hermes" has been applied to it. [[Centaur (minor planet)|Centaur]] [[2060 Chiron]] was discovered in 1977, and precovery images from 1895 have been located.&lt;ref name=jpl-chiron /&gt;

Another extreme case of precovery concerns [[Neptune]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] observed Neptune on both December 28, 1612 and January 27, 1613, when it was in a portion of its orbit where it was nearly directly behind Jupiter as seen from Earth. Because Neptune moves very slowly and is very faint relative to other known planets of that time, Galileo mistook it for a [[fixed star]], leaving the planet undiscovered until 1846. He did note that the "star" Neptune did seem to move, noting that between his two observations its apparent distance from another star had changed. However, unlike photographic images, drawings such as those Galileo made are usually not precise enough to be of use in refining an object's orbit. In 1795, [[Jérôme Lalande|Lalande]] also mistook Neptune for a star.&lt;ref name="Price-Handbook" /&gt; In 1690, [[John Flamsteed]] did the same with [[Uranus]], even cataloging it as "[[34 Tauri]]".

One of the most extreme cases postulated is of the discovery of [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. This again involved [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who is usually stated to have discovered it in 1610. It has been postulated by [[Xi Zezong]] that Ganymede was discovered by the Chinese astronomer [[Gan De]] in 365 B.C., when he catalogued it as a small red star next to Jupiter during naked eye observation.&lt;ref&gt;Galilean Moons– Gan De. Available at http://www.mediander.com/connects/12505/galilean-moons/#!/topic/1989270/ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041912/http://www.mediander.com/connects/12505/galilean-moons/ |date=2017-12-01 }} Accessed 27th November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be noted that by apparent magnitude, Ganymede is supposedly (barely) visible with the naked eye, but it is usually lost in the glare of its parent planet. It has been postulated that a tree limb could obscure Jupiter enough for observation.&lt;ref&gt;Gan De Biography. Available at {{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Gan_De.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029060501/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Gan_De.html |archivedate=2017-10-29 |df= }}. Accessed 27th November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This would be a precovery of nearly two thousand years, very probably the longest recorded.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1587">'''Process Decision Program Chart''' (PDPC) is a technique designed to help prepare [[contingency plan]]s.  The emphasis of the PDPC is to identify the consequential impact of failure on activity plans, and create appropriate contingency plans to limit risks.  Process diagrams and planning tree diagrams are extended by a couple of levels when the PDPC is applied to the bottom level tasks on those diagrams.

==Methodology==
From the bottom level of some activity box, the PDPC adds levels for:
# identifying what can go wrong (failure mode or risks)
# consequences of that failure (effect or consequence)
# possible countermeasures (risk mitigation action plan)&lt;ref&gt;http://site.iugaza.edu.ps/aschokry/files/2010/02/7_Tools.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar techniques==
The PDPC is similar to the [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA) in that both identify risks, consequences of failure, and contingency actions.  The FMEA adds prioritized risk levels through rating relative risk for each potential failure point.

'''Research in Computational Molecular Biology''' ('''RECOMB''') is an annual [[academic conference]] on the subjects of [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]]. The conference has been held every year since 1997 and is a major international conference in computational biology, alongside the [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology|ISMB]] and [[European Conference on Computational Biology|ECCB]] conferences.&lt;ref name=eccb-2010-editorial&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moreau|first1=Y|last2=Heringa|first2=J|title=Yves Moreau and Jaap Heringa, on behalf of the ECCB10 organizing and steering committees.|journal=Bioinformatics|date=Sep 15, 2010|volume=26|issue=18|pages=i412–3|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btq482|pmid=20823300|pmc=2935438}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference is affiliated with the [[International Society for Computational Biology]]. Since the first conference, authors of accepted proceedings papers have been invited to submit a revised version to a special issue of the ''[[Journal of Computational Biology]]''.&lt;ref name=jcb-partnership&gt;{{cite web|title=Partnerships|url=http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/recomb2010/partnership.html|accessdate=8 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809091409/http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/recomb2010/partnership.html|archivedate=9 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RECOMB was established in 1997 by Sorin Istrail, [[Pavel Pevzner]] and [[Michael Waterman]]. The first conference was held at the [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=recomb2014-proceedings /&gt;

A series of RECOMB Satellite meetings was established by [[Pavel Pevzner]] in 2001. These meetings cover specialist aspects of bioinformatics, including [[massively parallel sequencing]], [[comparative genomics]], [[Regulation of gene expression|regulatory genomics]] and bioinformatics education.&lt;ref name=satellites&gt;{{cite web|title=RECOMB - Annual International Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology - History - RECOMB Satellite Workshops|url=http://www.recomb.org/22481/RECOMB-Satellite-Workshops|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of RECOMB 2010, the conference has included a highlights track, modelled on the success of a similar track at the ISMB conference.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2892">'''Research software engineering''' is the use of [[software engineering]] practices in research applications. The term started to be used in [[United Kingdom]] in 2012&lt;ref name=FirstPaper&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital-research-2012.oerc.ox.ac.uk/papers/the-research-software-engineer/view|title=The Research Software Engineer — Digital Research 2012|website=digital-research-2012.oerc.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SSI_RseHistory&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hettrick|first1=Simon|title=A not-so-brief history of Research Software Engineers|url=https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-08-19-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers|publisher=Software Sustainability Institute|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, when it was needed to define the type of software development needed in research. This focuses on [[reproducibility]], [[reusability]], and accuracy  of data analysis and applications created for research.

== Support ==
Various type of associations and organisations have been created around this role to support the creation of posts in universities and research institutes. In 2014 a Research Software Engineer Association was created in UK&lt;ref name=ukrse_nation2017&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alys|first=Brett,|last2=Michael|first2=Croucher,|last3=Robert|first3=Haines,|last4=Simon|first4=Hettrick,|last5=James|first5=Hetherington,|last6=Mark|first6=Stillwell,|last7=Claire|first7=Wyatt,|date=2017-04-06|title=Research Software Engineers: State of the Nation Report 2017|url=https://zenodo.org/record/495360|journal=Zenodo|language=en|doi=10.5281/zenodo.495360}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with attracted 160 members in the first three months. Other countries like the Netherlands and Germany followed creating similar communities and there are similar efforts being pursued in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, [[Nordic countries]] and USA.

UK counts with more than 20 universities and institutes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rse.ac.uk/community/research-software-groups-rsgs/|title=Research Software Groups – Research Software Engineers Association|work=Research Software Engineers Association|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; with groups that provide access to software expertise to different areas of research. Additionally, the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] created a Research Software Engineer fellowship to promote this role and help the creation of RSE groups across UK. The fellowship calls run in 2015 and 2017

The world first RSE conference took place in UK in September 2016,&lt;ref name=ukrse_nation2017 /&gt; it was repeated in 2017, 2018 and now confirmed for 2019.

It has had a significant impact on collective responses to [[sexual harassment]] and [[sexual assault]] in Western academic [[science]].

Published in 2014 by a team of [[Anthropologist|anthropologists]], [[Kathryn B. H. Clancy]], Robin G. Nelson, Julienne N. Rutherford and [[Katie Hinde]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B. H.|last2=Nelson|first2=Robin G.|last3=Rutherford|first3=Julienne N.|last4=Hinde|first4=Katie|date=2014-07-16|title=Survey of Academic Field Experiences (SAFE): Trainees Report Harassment and Assault|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0102172|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=9|issue=7|pages=e102172|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0102172|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the SAFE13 study is the first empirical investigation into scientists' experiences of harassment during fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140716141308.htm|title=Sexual harassment, assault common on scientific field studies, survey indicates|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers identify three key takeaways from their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womeninastronomy.blogspot.com.au/2014/09/fed-up-with-sexual-harassment-ii-safe.html|title=Women In Astronomy: Fed Up with Sexual Harassment II: The SAFE study w/ Dr. Kate Clancy|last=Richey|first=Christina|date=2014-09-11|website=Women In Astronomy|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, women scientists are targeted more often than men, and junior scientists are also more likely to be harassed relative to senior scientists. Second, women are more likely to be harassed by senior staff, while men are harassed by their peers. Third, the majority of field scientists do not know how to report harassment.

== Methods ==
The study included responses from 666 field scientists (77.5% were women and 85.9% of participants identified as heterosexual). The survey was conducted in two waves. The first wave ran from February 21 to April 12, 2013, and captured responses from biological anthropologists.  The second wave, running from April 13 to May 10, collected responses from scientists in other disciplines. A further 26 interviews were completed to explore more in-depth experiences of sexual harassment in a broad range of fieldwork sites. The respondents were asked about experiences had at any time during their career.

The survey was not designed to estimate the prevalence of sexual harassment or assault at field sites. It was conducted online and offered anonymity, suggesting a potential [[self-selection bias]]. Only two questions in the survey directly queried the behavior experienced by respondents:

:32. Have you ever personally experienced inappropriate or sexual remarks, comments about physical beauty, cognitive sex differences, or other jokes, at an anthropological field site?

:39. Have you ever experienced physical sexual harassment, unwanted sexual contact, or sexual contact in which you could not or did not give consent or felt it would be unsafe to fight back or not give your consent at an anthropological field site?

An affirmative response to question 32 was counted as a report of sexual harassment, while an affirmative response to question 39 was counted as sexual assault, including rape.

== Findings ==
Almost three-quarters of participants (72.4%) had directly observed or been told about inappropriate behaviour or sexual comments during fieldwork. Around two-thirds of participants (64%) had personally experienced sexual language in the field and 20% of participants had experienced unwanted sexual contact. The study presented these findings as reports of "sexual harassment" and "sexual assault" respectively, though respondents were not asked whether they had been sexually harassed or assaulted. Following conventions in this area of scholarship, the study counted all "sexual remarks" as sexual harassment and all "unwanted sexual contact" as sexual assault.  

The majority of people who experienced sexual harassment and assault were students and postdoctoral candidates. Perpetrators vary according to their target's gender: women are more likely to be harassed by superiors (senior people who have authority over them), while men are more likely to be harassed by their peers. Few people were sexually harassed by local members of the public, and instead the harassment occurred between colleagues in the field.

The SAFE13 study identifies several areas of improvement in combating sexual harassment in the field. For example, only around one-third of field scientists (37.7%) recalled a code of conduct operating at their fieldwork site, and less than one-quarter remembered there being anti-harassment policies. Amongst respondents who had experienced sexual harassment or assault, only one-fifth of survivors (20% each of women and men) knew of an easy way to formally report this experience. Amongst the small minority of people who did report sexual harassment and assault, less than 20% were satisfied with the outcome. The study therefore contributes to a body of empirical studies showing workplace sexual harassment negatively impacts on personal safety and professional productivity. In particular, the study shines attention on the role of fieldwork site directors in establishing clear rules to discourage sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/567418|title=News Bureau {{!}} ILLINOIS|last=Yates|first=Diana|website=news.illinois.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SAFE2 ==
In 2017, the qualitative findings of SAFE13 were published. Authored by Nelson, Rutherford, Hinde and Clancy, the study focused on the experiences of 26 interviewees, who were mostly anthropologists or [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] (23 of 26 interviewees), women (23 of 26), and white (21 of 26).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Robin G.|last2=Rutherford|first2=Julienne N.|last3=Hinde|first3=Katie|last4=Clancy|first4=Kathryn B. H.|date=2017-12-01|title=Signaling Safety: Characterizing Fieldwork Experiences and Their Implications for Career Trajectories|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aman.12929/abstract|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=119|issue=4|pages=710–722|doi=10.1111/aman.12929|issn=1548-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some participants described incidents of sexual harassment in multiple fieldwork sites, so fifty-four field contexts are represented in their narratives. Twelve participants recalled working at field sites with clear anti-harassment rules (representing 18 fieldwork sites). These sites had training, explicit conversations, and senior researchers modelled proactive behaviour to redress sexual harassment. Actively enforced anti-harassment policies were associated with positive fieldwork experiences where scientists felt safe, valued and equal. These sites were categorised by the researchers as "green" contexts where best practice was enforced by senior members of the research team. As a result there were fewer negative experiences, and transgressions were acted upon by leaders.

The rest of the participants described ambiguity or lack of clarity about codes of conduct. Even if they had some rules, sexual harassment still took place because were no consequences. Ambiguity led to repercussions for scientists who resisted sexual coercion, such as being alienated from colleagues and being denied professional opportunities. Harassment and negative fieldwork experiences also led to negative letters of employment, strained workplace relationships, career stalling, being forced to move to another site, or leaving their careers. The hostility would be continued into the future in other contexts, such as at conferences. Some participants were discouraged or prevented from taking formal reporting action by administrators. The researchers call ambiguous sites "yellow" contexts because if there was a vague set of rules, they were not consistently applied. "Red" contexts are fieldwork sites where there is both an absence of rules and consequences. 

SAFE2 and SAFE13 are recognised as having led to concrete institutional and policy changes in academic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/a14104684/sexual-harassment-assault-in-science-field/|title="It Gnaws Away at Me": Female Scientists Report a Horrifying Culture of Sexual Assault|date=2017-12-11|work=Marie Claire|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic and public impact ==
Prior to its final publication, the evolving findings of the SAFE13 study received media coverage in 2013, with a focus on how sexual harassment creates a "chilly climate" in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/context-and-variation/safe13-field-site-chilly-climate-and-abuse/|title=I had no power to say that's not okay: Reports of harassment and abuse in the field|last=Clancy|first=Kate|date=|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2018-03-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public discussion of the evolving study's findings explored the negative impact of harassment on junior women researchers. Media articles focused on fear of professional retribution if scientists report sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/17/young-scientists-face-rampant-sexual-harassment-in-the-field/|title=Study: Young female scientists face sexual harassment, assault while in the field|last=Hogan|first=Caelainn|date=2014-07-17|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other science publishers discussed the sense of powerless that both victims and bystanders face as harassment goes unpunished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/04/survey-finds-sexual-harassment-anthropology|title=Survey Finds Sexual Harassment in Anthropology|date=2013-04-13|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the final report was published, the study became widely cited as evidence that sexual harassment contributes to women leaving science careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simmonds|first=Anna|title=Many women scientists sexually harassed during fieldwork|url=https://www.nature.com/news/many-women-scientists-sexually-harassed-during-fieldwork-1.15571|journal=Nature|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional scientific societies publicly responded that, beyond making principal researchers responsible for reporting sexual harassment, institutional responses were additionally required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/07/16/sexual-assault-harassment-science-fieldwork-studies-research-study/12735343/|title=Sex assaults, harassment reported in science fieldwork|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, USA Rep. [[Jackie Speier]] of California sponsored a bill to compel research institutions to report investigations of harassment as a condition of receiving federal grant money. She cited the SAFE13 study as one piece of evidence informing the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://speier.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congresswoman-jackie-speier-introduces-bill-stop-rampant-sexual-abuse|title=Congresswoman Jackie Speier Introduces Bill to Stop Rampant Sexual Abuse, Harassment in STEM Research|date=2016-09-21|work=Congresswoman Jackie Speier|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also referred to SAFE13 in media interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/jackie-speier-sexual-harassment-science/|title=Rep Jackie Speier on Why She's Taking on Sexual Harassment in Science|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, the USA [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) announced it would require institutions to report whenever a researcher who is funded by their grants has engaged in sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/issuances/in144.jsp|title=Important Notice No. 144: Harassment (in144) {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSF also expects institutions they fund to provide a harassment-free workplace. The NSF Office of Diversity and Inclusion will additionally provide policies and resources to support this aim, and create an anonymous reporting system to receive direct reports of sexual harassment.

On 27 February 2018, lead researcher of the SAFE13 study, Kathryn (Kate) Clancy, provided testimony to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing on sexual harassment in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-research-and-technology-hearing-review-sexual-harassment-and|title=Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing - A Review of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct in Science|date=2018-02-27|work=Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing identified a need to redress sexual harassment in science as a way to boost opportunities in science.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Samikshavad.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Politicians of Today'' by Ram Chandra Shukla]] --&gt;'''Samikshavad''' is the first indigenous [[art movement]] in modern [[India]], which started in [[North India]] in 1974. It has a different identity from the western movements of art. It is neither affected nor inspired by western art.

Its main source of inspiration is the present social, political, cultural and economic conditions. Its aim is to make the art free from personalized obligations and to socialize it, to change the art from mystery to something having special aim. By this style, the artist tends to expose the corruption prevalent in society and politics, with a language that is symbolic and satirical. This movement has changed the scenario of modern Indian painting in India in the late '70s. A few of the artists who were inspired by this movement were Ravindra Nath Mishra, Hridya Narayan Mishra, Santosh Kumar Singh, Virendra Prasad Singh, Ram Shabd Singh, Raghuvir Sen Dhir, Ved Prakash Mishra, Gopal Madhukar Chaturvedi, Bala Dutt Pandey etc. Prof. [[Ram Chandra Shukla]], Professor and Head of the Department of Painting at [[Banaras Hindu University]], [[Varanasi]], at that time, was the initiator and the main source of inspiration for this movement.

==The theme of Samikshavad==

Samikshavad is an Indian movement of Modern Art which is opposed to the tendency of Indian artists following the Western trends of Modern Art. Its basic purpose is to help create such an art in the country which has its roots in Indian soil. "Samiksha" is a Sanskrit word which means criticism of life and society in which they live. It is also against any type of imitation of the past styles or the present styles of art. A manifesto of the movement was published at the first exhibition of such paintings at the [[AIFACS]] Gallery in 1979 at Delhi. The exhibition presented in all, 26 paintings in oil medium. The artists whose works were included in the first exhibition were S/s R.C. Shukla, R.S. Dhir, Santosh Kumar Singh and Ved Prakash Mishra from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi; Dr. Gopal Madhukar Chaturvedi from Aligarh and Bala Dutt Pandey from Allahabad. The exhibition was inaugurated by the well-known "young Turk" Shri Chandra Shekhar, then President of the [[Janata Party]]. Since then lots of comments, reviews and articles have come from several of the leading newspapers, weeklies and art journals referring to this movement. Invitations have been received from several parts of India to hold exhibitions there. There is a silent but meaningful whisper in the air about "Samikshavad" in Indian art circles. Several illustrated lecture programs on Samikshavad have been sponsored by university art departments at different places. The movement has gained ground in the country and has created a new atmosphere in the field of art for an indigenous development of Indian Modern Art. The only hurdle in the way of Indian art is prejudice, ''purvagrah'' (bias) and misconception. Samikshavad is a modern movement of Indian contemporary art.

The exhibition at Delhi was visited by thousands of people{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} including well-known artists, art critics, art connoisseurs, journalists and the common people.

Modern Western art is either an expression of the artists' inner turmoil and tensions or mere feats of colour and form. Mostly it is aimless or personal fad. Can such art ever become popular and useful to society at large? But capitalist society has accepted it as a form of business transactions. They collect art and sell art just to make capital out of it. In a poor country like India art cannot fulfill that aim. Art can have no other aim but to serve the people, to inspire and educate them, to prepare them for a better life and society. And "Samikshavad" aims at that.

"Samikshavadi" artists are not at all interested in merely showing feats of colour and form. Colour and form or their composition, in itself that of abstract art, may produce a musical or magical effect, but art cannot survive or thrive on that alone. Such music or magic, if they just remain to be a form of entertainment and do not serve a higher purpose of social uplift, cannot claim to be great art. They may remain in the category of crafts. But those crafts which are not useful like "witch-craft" have no place in modern society. Today the so-called Modern Artists who are better than such craftsmen, when called upon to explain the purpose of their art, prattle, "We create 'Form', 'Colour composition' or 'Symbol'". They go no further and expect the visitor to appreciate and explain their jargon themselves. Line, form, colour, texture or tones are just elements of the language of art. They cannot be an end in themselves. They have to be used skilfully to serve the purpose of communication or expression. If they fail in this they are just like heaps of useless bricks, sand and cement gathered together. They cannot claim to be purposeful if they do not help in creating a building suitable for human living. "Samikshavadi" painters are not interested in showing their excellence of skill or painterly qualities as an end in itself.

They believe in using simple, direct and powerful language of art to express their ideas and feelings forcefully as witnessed in the folk arts. Painterly qualities or the fineries of art are the fads of a capitalist or feudalistic society; they are not at all needed in the socialistic society.
Samikshavadi painters use a symbolic language. They express their ideas and feelings through common and powerful symbols. It is because of this that sometimes they are mistaken for Surrealists, which they certainly are not. Surrealists are also supposed to use dream symbols influenced by Freud's dream psychology, and they claimed it to be "pure psychic automatism through which it is intended to express the true functioning of thought. Thought dictated in the absence of all control exerted by reason", whereas Samikshavadis use common symbols consciously and rationally to express their desired idea. Surrealist works are mystic and fantastic in nature but a Samikshavadi artist is socially motivated; a Surrealist attitude is highly personal and individual whereas a Samikshavadi attitude is generally impersonal. Surrealism is basically an anti-art movement but Samikshavadi is an art movement suited to the present atmosphere in the country.

It is generally satirical in nature. The element of satire is its specialty. Up till now the element of satire was generally considered to be a feature of cartoons or caricatures.  Never before in the history of Indian art was satire used as an important medium of art expression in the form of painting, as seen in Samikshavadi art. Perhaps satire was not considered to be necessary or advisable in painting because ancient and medieval art was mostly religious, mythological and idealistic. Under the present circumstances and social change art cannot remain only religious. It has tended towards secularism. The Samikshavadi painters are motivated by day-to-day happenings and are sensitive to the political and social conditions in which they live today. The social, political and economic problems of India are depressing. Life is becoming insecure and helpless. Poverty has multiplied. Exploitation is at its height. Under such circumstances artists and writers have to play an important role. They cannot just remain in a dreamland. They have to educate their people and awaken them to be prepared to fight the evils of the society. Satire is a powerful media to bring to bring people back to senses. Satire can give a shock treatment to generate a new energy in the people to face the real problems, to transform the society. Samikshavad aims at that and that is why it has taken a new course which was not commonly used in the field of painting up till now. Their path may appear to the prejudiced person aesthetically unsound but it is socially very promising.

It is true that Samikshavadi painters are against imagination of any of the past styles or isms of art of the East or the West, but sometimes their work may indicate some influences. This may either be consciously done or just due to past habit, and may disappear after some time. But whatever influences are seen they are generally of a technical nature. Samikshavadi painters are free to choose any technique that serves them in expressing their ideas and feelings powerfully. Some of the Samikshavadis are interested in using techniques of the past Indian Art to become more meaningful and effective. This does not mean that they are tied to any traditional style. Technique and style or "isms" are not the same thing.

The themes of Samikshavadi paintings are taken from social life of the common people. It is not something new. Many artists have done so in the past and are still doing so. In India [[Amrita Shergil]] was the first important and powerful painter of social life. Satish Gujral in his early phase also painted social life powerfully. Others have also done it. But there is a difference of approach between them and Samikshavadi painters. Most of the artists have been interested in their day-to-day social life. That also is no doubt important and useful in bringing about social change but Samikshavadi painters are not contented with that only. They have gone a step further. They may show the plight of the people also but they are much more interested in attacking those who are responsible for it. If the causes are exposed the people will be more alert to eradicate them. Their description of the malady suggests lines of treatment. Moreover, Samikshavadi painters are generally interested in conscious symbolic sarcasm which is definitely a new phenomenon in the field of painting. This attitude has been witnessed casually in some form or the other in some of the artists' work in India and abroad, but never before it has come out as a combined movement with this particular purpose. Mostly other painters have been just satisfied in mocking the contemporary life pattern as did the pop artist of the west, which has been nothing but an anti-art attitude, or the Surrealists' like that of Chagall and Richard Hamilton. Bhupen Khokhor of India has followed the same attitude of the pop artist of the West.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3288">In [[star|stellar]] [[astrophysics]], the '''Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit''' is the maximum mass of a non-fusing, [[isothermal]] core that can support an enclosing envelope. It is expressed as the ratio of the core mass to the total mass of the core and envelope. Estimates of the limit depend on the models used and the assumed chemical compositions of the core and envelope; typical values given are from 0.10 to 0.15 (10% to 15% of the total stellar mass).&lt;ref name="poly"&gt;The Schoenberg-Chandrasekhar limit: A polytropic approximation, Martin Beech, ''Astrophysics and Space Science'' '''147''', #2 (August 1988), pp. 219-227.  DOI [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00645666 10.1007/BF00645666].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/Schonberg-Chandrasekhar_limit.html Schönberg-Chandrasekhar limit], ''The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy, and Spaceflight'', David Darling.  Accessed on line April 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the maximum to which a helium-filled core can grow, and if this limit is exceeded, as can only happen in massive stars, the core collapses, releasing energy that causes the outer layers of the star to expand to become a red giant. It is named after the [[astrophysicist]]s [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] and [[Mario Schönberg]], who estimated its value in a 1942 paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1942ApJ....96..161S On the Evolution of the Main-Sequence Stars], M. Schönberg and S. Chandrasekhar, ''Astrophysical Journal'' '''96''', #2 (September 1942), pp. 161&amp;ndash;172.&lt;/ref&gt; They estimated it to be 
&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{(\frac{\operatorname{M}_{ic}}{M})}_{SC} = 0.37 (\frac{\operatorname{\mu}_{e}}{\operatorname{\mu}_{ic}})^2&lt;/math&gt;

The Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit comes into play when fusion in a [[main-sequence star]] exhausts the [[hydrogen]] at the center of the star.  The star then contracts until hydrogen fuses in a shell surrounding a helium-rich core, both of which are surrounded by an envelope consisting primarily of hydrogen.  The core increases in mass as the shell burns its way outwards through the star.  If the star's mass is less than approximately 1.5 [[solar mass]]es, the core will become degenerate before the Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit is reached, and, on the other hand, if the mass is greater than approximately 6 [[solar mass]]es, the star leaves the main sequence with a core mass already greater than the Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit so its core is never isothermal before helium fusion.  In the remaining case, where the mass is between 1.5 and 6 solar masses, the core will grow until the  limit is reached, at which point it will contract rapidly until helium starts to fuse in the core.&lt;ref name="poly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="notes"&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/physics/people/vdhillon/teaching/phy213/phy213_highmass.html the evolution of high-mass stars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013132723/http://shef.ac.uk/physics/people/vdhillon/teaching/phy213/phy213_highmass.html |date=2007-10-13 }}, lecture notes, Vik Dhillon, Physics 213, University of Sheffield.

'''Seawater''', or '''salt water''', is water from a sea or ocean. On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a [[salinity]] of about 3.5% (35&amp;nbsp;g/L, 599 mM). This means that every kilogram (roughly one litre by volume) of seawater has approximately {{convert|35|g|oz}} of [[sea salt|dissolved salts]] (predominantly [[sodium]] ({{chem|Na||+}}) and [[chloride]] ({{chem|Cl||-}}) [[ions]]). Average density at the surface is 1.025&amp;nbsp;kg/L. Seawater is [[density|denser]] than both [[fresh water]] and pure water (density 1.0&amp;nbsp;kg/L at {{convert|4|C|F}}) because the dissolved salts increase the mass by a larger proportion than the volume. The [[Melting point|freezing point]] of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases. At typical salinity, it freezes at about {{convert|-2|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onr.navy.mil/Focus/ocean/water/temp3.htm |title=U.S. Office of Naval Research Ocean, Water: Temperature |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212151229/http://www.onr.navy.mil/Focus/ocean/water/temp3.htm |archivedate=12 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The coldest seawater ever recorded (in a liquid state) was in 2010, in a stream under an [[Antarctic]] [[glacier]], and measured {{convert|-2.6|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author= Sylte, Gudrun Urd |title= Den aller kaldaste havstraumen |url= http://www.forskning.no/artikler/2010/mai/250690 |language= Norwegian |date= 24 May 2010 |work= forskning.no |accessdate= 24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seawater [[pH]] is typically limited to a range between 7.5 and 8.4.&lt;ref name="Chester Marine Geochem"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chester, Jickells|first=Roy, Tim|title=Marine Geochemistry|date=2012|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=978-1-118-34907-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no universally accepted reference pH-scale for seawater and the difference between measurements based on different reference scales may be up to 0.14 units.&lt;ref&gt;Stumm, W, Morgan, J.

Although the vast majority of seawater has a salinity of between 31 g/kg and 38 g/kg, that is 3.1-3.8%, seawater is not uniformly saline throughout the world. Where mixing occurs with fresh water runoff from river mouths, near melting glaciers or vast amounts of precipitation (e.g. [[Monsoon]]), seawater can be substantially less saline. The most saline open sea is the [[Red Sea]], where high rates of [[evaporation]], low [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and low river run-off, and confined circulation result in unusually salty water. The salinity in isolated bodies of water can be considerably greater still - about ten times higher in the case of the [[Dead Sea]]. Historically, several salinity scales were used to approximate the absolute salinity of seawater. A popular scale was the "Practical Salinity Scale" where salinity was measured in "practical salinity units (psu)". The current standard for salinity is the "Reference Salinity" scale &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Millero|first1=Frank J.|last2=Feistel|first2=Rainer|last3=Wright|first3=Daniel G.|last4=McDougall|first4=Trevor J.|title=The composition of Standard Seawater and the definition of the Reference-Composition Salinity Scale|journal=Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers|date=January 2008|volume=55|issue=1|pages=50–72|doi=10.1016/j.dsr.2007.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the salinity expressed in units of "g/kg".

===Thermophysical properties of Seawater===
The [[density]] of surface seawater ranges from about 1020 to 1029&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, depending on the temperature and salinity. At a temperature of 25&amp;nbsp;°C, salinity of 35 g/kg and 1 atm pressure, the density of seawater is 1023.6 &amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Nayar&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nayar|first1=Kishor G.|last2=Sharqawy|first2=Mostafa H.|last3=Banchik|first3=Leonardo D.|last4=Lienhard V|first4=John H.|title=Thermophysical properties of seawater: A review and new correlations that include pressure dependence|journal=Desalination|date=July 2016|volume=390|pages=1–24|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2016.02.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web |title=Thermophysical properties of seawater|url=http://web.mit.edu/seawater|publisher=Department of Mechanical Engineering, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=February 24, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep in the ocean, under high pressure, seawater can reach a density of 1050&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or higher. The density of seawater also changes with salinity. Brines generated by seawater desalination plants can have salinities up to 120 g/kg. The density of typical seawater brine of 120 g/kg salinity at 25&amp;nbsp;°C and atmospheric pressure is 1088&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Nayar/&gt;&lt;ref name=MIT/&gt; Seawater [[pH]] is limited to the range 7.5 to 8.4. The [[speed of sound]] in seawater is about 1,500&amp;nbsp;m/s (whereas speed of sound is usually around 330&amp;nbsp;m/s in air at roughly 1000hPa pressure, 1 atmosphere), and varies with water temperature, salinity, and pressure. The [[thermal conductivity]] of seawater is 0.6&amp;nbsp;W/mK at 25&amp;nbsp;°C and a salinity of 35&amp;nbsp;g/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/lienhard/www/Thermophysical_properties_of_seawater-DWT-16-354-2010.pdf |title=Desalination and Water Treatment |publisher=Department of Mechanical Engineering, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |date = April 2010|accessdate=17 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The thermal conductivity decreases with increasing salinity and increases with increasing temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twt.mpei.ac.ru/tthb/2/Tab-5-5-13-2-Ther-Cond-Seawater.html |title=Thermal conductivity of seawater and its concentrates |accessdate=17 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seawater contains more dissolved [[ion]]s than all types of freshwater.&lt;ref name=Gale&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Mi-Oc/Ocean-Chemical-Processes.html |last=Gale |first=Thomson |title=Ocean Chemical Processes |accessdate=2 December 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ratios of solutes differ dramatically. For instance, although seawater contains about 2.8 times more [[bicarbonate]] than river water, the [[percentage]] of bicarbonate in seawater as a ratio of ''all'' dissolved [[ion]]s is far lower than in river water. Bicarbonate ions constitute 48% of river water solutes but only 0.14% for seawater.&lt;ref name=Gale/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pinet&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences like these are due to the varying [[Residence time (fluid dynamics)|residence time]]s of seawater solutes; [[sodium]] and [[chlorine|chloride]] have very long residence times, while [[calcium]] (vital for [[carbonate]] formation) tends to precipitate much more quickly.&lt;ref name=Pinet/&gt; The most abundant dissolved ions in seawater are sodium, chloride, [[magnesium]], [[sulfate]] and calcium.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C.

Small amounts of other substances are found, including [[amino acids]] at concentrations of up to 2 micrograms of nitrogen atoms per liter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02742615|url=http://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/JO/pdf/5404/54040313.pdf| title = Dissolved free amino acids in coastal seawater using a modified fluorometric method| journal = Journal of Oceanography| volume = 54| issue = 4| pages = 313–321| year = 1998| last1 = Tada | first1 = K. | last2 = Tada | first2 = M. | last3 = Maita | first3 = Y. }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are thought to have played a key role in the [[abiogenesis|origin of life]].

==Microbial components==
Research in 1957 by the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] sampled water in both [[pelagic]] and [[neritic]] locations in the Pacific Ocean. Direct microscopic counts and cultures were used, the direct counts in some cases showing up to 10 000 times that obtained from cultures. These differences were attributed to the occurrence of bacteria in aggregates, selective effects of the culture media, and the presence of inactive cells. A marked reduction in bacterial culture numbers was noted below the [[thermocline]], but not by direct microscopic observation. Large numbers of [[spirilli]]-like forms were seen by microscope but not under cultivation. The disparity in numbers obtained by the two methods is well known in this and other fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_4/issue_2/0128.pdf | title= Bacterial Populations in Sea Water as Determined by Different Methods of Enumeration | first1= Holger W. | last1= Jannasch | first2= Galen E. | last2= Jones | volume= 4 | number= 2 | journal= Limnology and Oceanography | publisher= Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography | pages= 128–139 | accessdate= 13 May 2013 | doi= 10.4319/lo.1959.4.2.0128 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130619213159/http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_4/issue_2/0128.pdf | archivedate= 19 June 2013 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, improved techniques of detection and identification of microbes by probing just small snippets of [[DNA]], enabled researchers taking part in the [[Census of Marine Life]] to identify thousands of previously unknown microbes usually present only in small numbers. This revealed a far greater diversity than previously suspected, so that a litre of seawater may hold more than 20,000 species. [[Mitchell Sogin]] from the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] feels that "the number of different kinds of bacteria in the oceans could eclipse five to 10 million."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/08/060829081744.htm| work= ScienceDaily | title= Ocean Microbe Census Discovers Diverse World of Rare Bacteria | date= 2 September 2006 | publisher= | accessdate= 13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacteria are found at all depths in the [[water column]], as well as in the sediments, some being aerobic, others anaerobic. Most are free-swimming, but some exist as [[symbionts]] within other organisms – examples of these being bioluminescent bacteria. [[Cyanobacteria]] played an important role in the evolution of ocean processes, enabling the development of [[stromatolites]] and oxygen in the atmosphere.

Some bacteria interact with [[diatoms]], and form a critical link in the cycling of silicon in the ocean. One anaerobic species, ''[[Thiomargarita namibiensis]]'', plays an important part in the breakdown of [[hydrogen sulfide]] eruptions from diatomaceous sediments off the Namibian coast, and generated by high rates of [[phytoplankton]] growth in the [[Benguela Current]] upwelling zone, eventually falling to the seafloor.

Bacteria-like [[Archaea]] surprised marine microbiologists by their survival and thriving in extreme environments, such as the [[hydrothermal vents]] on the ocean floor. Alkalotolerant marine bacteria such as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' and ''[[Vibrio]]'' spp. survive in a [[pH]] range of 7.3 to 10.6, while some species will grow only at pH 10 to 10.6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/2/m002p105.pdf |title= Alkalotolerant and Alkalophilic Bacteria in Seawater |first1= M. |last1= Maeda |first2= N. |last2= Taga | journal= Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume= 2 | pages= 105–108 | date= 31 March 1980 | publisher=  | accessdate= 13 May 2013 | doi=10.3354/meps002105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaea also exist in pelagic waters and may constitute as much as half the ocean's [[biomass]], clearly playing an important part in oceanic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5232928.stm | date= 31 July 2006 | title= Thousands of microbes in one gulp | first= Louisa |last= Cheung | work= BBC News | accessdate= 13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 sediments from the ocean floor revealed a species of Archaea that breaks down [[methane]], an important [[greenhouse]] gas and a major contributor to atmospheric warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2000/10/05-01.html | title= The Case of the Missing Methane | first= Mitchell | last= Leslie | date= 5 October 2000 | work= ScienceNOW | publisher= American Association for the Advancement of Science | accessdate= 13 May 2013 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130526182906/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2000/10/05-01.html | archivedate= 26 May 2013 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bacteria break down the rocks of the sea floor, influencing seawater chemistry. Oil spills, and runoff containing human sewage and chemical pollutants have a marked effect on microbial life in the vicinity, as well as harbouring pathogens and toxins affecting all forms of marine life. The protist [[dinoflagellates]] may at certain times undergo population explosions called blooms or [[red tide]]s, often after human-caused pollution. The process may produce [[metabolites]] known as biotoxins, which move along the ocean food chain, tainting higher-order animal consumers.

''[[Pandoravirus salinus]]'', a species of very large virus, with a genome much larger than that of any other virus species, was discovered in 2013. Like the other very large viruses ''[[Mimivirus]]'' and ''[[Megavirus]]'', ''Pandoravirus'' infects amoebas, but its genome, containing 1.9 to 2.5 megabases of DNA, is twice as large as that of ''Megavirus'', and it differs greatly from the other large viruses in appearance and in genome structure.

In 2013 researchers from [[Aberdeen University]] announced that they were starting a hunt for undiscovered chemicals in organisms that have evolved in deep sea trenches, hoping to find "the next generation" of antibiotics, anticipating an "antibiotic apocalypse" with a dearth of new infection-fighting drugs. The EU-funded research will start in the [[Atacama Trench]] and then move on to search trenches off New Zealand and Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21457149 |title= Antibiotics search to focus on sea bed | date= 14 February 2013 | work= BBC News | accessdate= 13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ocean has a long history of human waste disposal on the assumption that its vast size makes it capable of absorbing and diluting all noxious material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nKkrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA36 |title= Radioactivity in the marine environment| work= National Academies, 1971 page 36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
While this may be true on a small scale, the large amounts of sewage routinely dumped has damaged many coastal ecosystems, and rendered them life-threatening. Pathogenic viruses and bacteria occur in such waters, such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' the cause of [[cholera]], [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis E]] and [[polio]], along with protozoans causing [[giardiasis]] and [[cryptosporidiosis]]. These pathogens are routinely present in the ballast water of large vessels, and are widely spread when the ballast is discharged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Mi-Oc/Microbes-in-the-Ocean.html |title= Microbes in the Ocean |first1= Brian D. |last1= Hoyle | first2= Richard |last2= Robinson | work= Water Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scientific theory|Scientific theories]] behind the origins of sea salt started with Sir [[Edmond Halley]] in 1715, who proposed that salt and other minerals were carried into the sea by rivers after rainfall washed it out of the ground. Upon reaching the ocean, these salts concentrated as more salt arrived over time (see [[Water cycle|Hydrologic cycle]]). Halley noted that most lakes that don't have ocean outlets (such as the [[Dead Sea]] and the [[Caspian Sea]], see [[endorheic basin]]), have high salt content. Halley termed this process "continental weathering".

Halley's theory was partly correct. In addition, sodium leached out of the ocean floor when the ocean formed. The presence of salt's other dominant ion, chloride, results from [[outgassing]] of chloride (as [[hydrochloric acid]]) with other gases from Earth's interior via [[volcano]]s and [[hydrothermal vent]]s. The sodium and chloride ions subsequently became the most abundant constituents of sea salt.

Ocean salinity has been stable for billions of years, most likely as a consequence of a chemical/[[plate tectonics|tectonic]] system which removes as much salt as is deposited; for instance, sodium and chloride sinks include [[evaporite]] deposits, pore-water burial, and reactions with seafloor [[basalt]]s.&lt;ref name=Pinet/&gt;{{rp|133}}

==Human impacts==
[[Climate change]], rising atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], excess nutrients, and pollution in many forms are altering global oceanic geochemistry. Rates of change for some aspects greatly exceed those in the historical and recent geological record. Major trends include an increasing [[ocean acidification|acidity]], reduced subsurface oxygen in both near-shore and pelagic waters, rising coastal nitrogen levels, and widespread increases in [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and persistent organic pollutants. Most of these perturbations are tied either directly or indirectly to human fossil fuel combustion, fertilizer, and industrial activity. Concentrations are projected to grow in coming decades, with negative impacts on ocean biota and other marine resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doney|first=Scott C.|title=The Growing Human Footprint on Coastal and Open-Ocean Biogeochemistry|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=18 June 2010|volume=328|issue=5985|pages=1512–1516|doi=10.1126/science.1185198|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5985/1512.full|accessdate=16 December 2011|pmid=20558706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most striking features of this is [[ocean acidification]], resulting from increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake of the oceans related to higher atmospheric concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and higher temperatures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-01-01|title=Ocean Acidification: The Other CO2 Problem|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.marine.010908.163834|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|volume=1|issue=1|pages=169–192|doi=10.1146/annurev.marine.010908.163834|pmid=21141034}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it severely affects [[coral reef]]s and [[crustacean]]s (see [[coral bleaching]]).

==Human consumption==
{{main|Sea water poisoning}}{{See also|Desalination}}
Accidentally consuming small quantities of clean seawater is not harmful, especially if the seawater is taken along with a larger quantity of fresh water. However, drinking seawater to maintain hydration is counterproductive; more water must be excreted to eliminate the salt (via [[urine]]) than the amount of water obtained from the seawater itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/drinksw.html |title=Can humans drink seawater? |publisher=[[National Ocean Service]] ([[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Urinary system|renal system]] actively regulates sodium chloride in the blood within a very narrow range around 9 g/L (0.9% by weight).

In most open waters concentrations vary somewhat around typical values of about 3.5%, far higher than the body can tolerate and most beyond what the kidney can process. A point frequently overlooked in claims that the kidney can excrete NaCl in Baltic concentrations of 2% (in arguments to the contrary) is that the gut cannot absorb water at such concentrations, so that there is no benefit in drinking such water. Drinking seawater temporarily increases blood's NaCl concentration. This signals the [[kidney]] to excrete sodium, but seawater's sodium concentration is above the kidney's maximum concentrating ability. Eventually the blood's sodium concentration rises to toxic levels, removing water from cells and interfering with [[nerve]] conduction, ultimately producing fatal [[Non-epileptic seizure|seizure]] and [[cardiac arrhythmia]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

[[Survival skills|Survival manual]]s consistently advise against drinking seawater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.bordeninstitute.army.mil/published_volumes/harshEnv2/HE2ch29.pdf |chapter=29 |title=Shipboard Medicine |accessdate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of 163 [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|life raft]] voyages estimated the risk of death at 39% for those who drank seawater, compared to 3% for those who did not.

The temptation to drink seawater was greatest for sailors who had expended their supply of fresh water, and were unable to capture enough rainwater for drinking. This frustration was described famously by a line from [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'':

::: ''"Water, water, everywhere,&lt;br /&gt;And all the boards did shrink;&lt;br /&gt; Water, water, everywhere,&lt;br /&gt;Nor any drop to drink."''

Although humans cannot survive on seawater, some people claim that up to two cups a day, mixed with fresh water in a 2:3 ratio, produces no ill effect. The French physician [[Alain Bombard]] survived an ocean crossing in a small Zodiak rubber boat using mainly raw fish meat, which contains about 40 percent water (like most living tissues), as well as small amounts of seawater and other provisions harvested from the ocean. His findings were challenged, but an alternative explanation was not given. In his 1948 book, ''[[Kon-Tiki]]'', [[Thor Heyerdahl]] reported drinking seawater mixed with fresh in a 2:3 ratio during the 1947 expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Heyerdahl, Thor; Lyon, F.H. (translator) (1950). ''Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific by Raft''.  Rand McNally &amp; Company, Chicago, Ill.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, another adventurer, [[William Willis (sailor)|William Willis]], claimed to have drunk two cups of seawater and one cup of fresh per day for 70 days without ill effect when he lost part of his water supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Rankings===
[[File:Shinshu univ ueda koudou2.JPG|thumb|Faculty of Textile Science and Technology Auditorium. Cultural property. Construction 1929.]]
In September 2005, the university chair decided not to participate in national or international rankings in the foreseeable future, stating the administrative expenditures needed as a main reason. The small sample size used by many rankings and their methodology have also been criticised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entrance ceremony President Greetings|publisher=Atsushi Komiyama|url=http://www.shinshu-u.ac.jp/guidance/president/|date=September 21, 2005|accessdate=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Shinshu University is still being featured in international rankings.

Unlike other subjects in the [[Scottish educational system]], those who take it are picked specially to do it, normally due to failings in other subjects or social issues. There are exceptions to this rule however, such as [[Elgin Academy, Scotland|Elgin Academy]] in Moray, where it is taken as an additional compulsory standard grade by all pupils, giving most students a possible total of 9.

In [[Anatomical terms of location|Anatomy]] it might be the case that a spatial relation is not fully applicable. Thus, the degree of applicability is defined which specifies from 0 till 100% how strongly a spatial relation holds. Often researchers concentrate on defining the applicability function for various spatial relations.

In [[spatial database]]s and [[Geospatial topology]] the ''spatial relations'' are used for ''spatial analysis'' and constraint specifications.

In [[cognitive development]] for walk and for catch objects, or [[Water-level task|for understand objects-behaviour]]; in [[Automated Guided Vehicle#Natural Features Navigation|robotic Natural Features Navigation]]; and many other areas, ''spatial relations'' plays a central role.

Commonly used types of ''spatial relations'' are: ''topological'', ''directional'' and ''distance'' relations.

!valign="top"|''Equals''
| ''a'' = ''b''&lt;br/&gt;Topologically [[Equality (relational operator)|equal]].  Also (''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''a'') ∧ (''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''b'')

|-
!valign="top"|''Disjoint''
|''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ∅ &lt;br/&gt; ''a'' and ''b'' are disjoint, have no point in common. They form a set of  [[Disconnected (topology)#Disconnected spaces|disconnected]] geometries.

|-
!valign="middle"|''Intersects'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a'' ∩ ''b'' ≠ ∅

|-
!valign="top"|''Touches''
|(''a'' ∩ ''b'' ≠ ∅) ∧ (''a''&lt;sup&gt;ο&lt;/sup&gt; ∩ ''b''&lt;sup&gt;ο&lt;/sup&gt; = ∅) &lt;br/&gt; ''a'' touches ''b'', they have at least one boundary point in common, but no interior points.

|-
!valign="top"|''Contains''
|''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''b''

|-
!valign="top"|''Covers''
|''a''&lt;sup&gt;ο&lt;/sup&gt; ∩ ''b'' = ''b'' &lt;br/&gt; ''b'' lies in the interior of ''a'' (extends ''Contains''). Other definitions: "no points of ''b'' lie in the exterior of ''a''", or "Every point of ''b'' is a point of (the interior of) ''a''".

|-
!valign="middle"|''CoveredBy''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
|''Covers(b,a)''

|-
!valign="top"|''Within'' 
|''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''a''
|}

== Directional relations ==
Directional relations can again be differentiated into external directional relations and internal directional relations. An internal directional relation specifies where an object is located inside the reference object while an external relations specifies where the object is located outside of the reference objects.

*Examples for internal directional relations: left; on the back; athwart, abaft
*Examples for external directional relations: on the right of; behind; in front of, abeam, astern

== Distance relations ==
Distance relations specify how far is the object away from the reference object.
*Examples are: at; nearby; in the vicinity; far away

== Relations by class ==
Reference objects represented by a [[bounding box]] or another kind of "spatial envelope" that encloses its borders, can be denoted with the maximum number of [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimensions]] of this envelope:  &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; for [[Point (geometry)|punctual objects]], &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; for [[Line (geometry)|linear objects]], &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt; for [[area|planar objects]], &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt; for [[volume|volumetric objects]]. So, any object, in a [[2D geometric model|2D modeling]], can by  classified as ''point'', ''line'' or ''area'' according to its delimitation. Then, a ''type of spatial relation'' can be expressed by the class of the objects that participate in the relation:

* [[Spatial relation/point-point|point-point relations]]: ...
* [[Spatial relation/point-line|point-line relations]]:
* [[Spatial relation/point-area|point-area relations]]:
* [[Spatial relation/line-line|line-line relations]]:
* [[Spatial relation/line-area|line-area relations]]:
* [[Spatial relation/area-area|area-area relations]]:

More ''complex'' modeling schemas can represent an object as a composition of ''simple sub-objects''. Examples: represent in a [[astronomical map]] a star by a ''point'' and a [[binary star]] by ''two points'';  represent in [[geographical map]] a river with a ''line'', for its  [[river source|source]] [[stream]], and with an strip-''area'', for the rest of the river.  These schemas can use the above classes, uniform composition classes (''multi-point'', ''multi-line'' and ''multi-area'') and heterogeneous composition (''points''+''lines'' as "object of dimension 1", ''points''+''lines''+''areas'' as "object of dimension 2").

Two internal components of a ''complex object'' can express (the above) [[Binary operation|binary relations]] between them, and [[Ternary operation|ternary relations]], using the  whole object as a [[frame of reference]]. Some relations can be expressed by an abstract component, such the [[center of mass]] of the binary star, or a center line of the river.

== Temporal references ==
For human thinking, spatial relations include qualities like size, distance, volume, order, and, also, time:
{{Quotation|
Time is spatial: it requires understanding ordered sequences such as days of the week, months of the year, and seasons. A person with spatial difficulties may have problems understanding “yesterday,” “last week,” and “next month”. 
Time expressed digitally is just as spatial as time expressed by moving clock hands, but digital clocks remove the need to translate the hand position into numbers.

Possin (1998) [http://impactofspecialneeds.weebly.com/uploads/3/4/1/9/3419723/spatial.pdf Spatial Relations and Learning].&lt;/ref&gt;  discusses the many ways in which people with difficulty establishing spatial and temporal relationships can face problems in ordinary situations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1971">'''Sulfur water''' (or '''sulphur water''') is a condition where the running water contains a high amount of [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas that escapes into the air when the plumbing line is opened, giving a distinct "rotten egg" smell.  

==Cause and treatment==
The condition indicates a high level of [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]] in the water supply. This may be due to the use of well water, poorly treated city water, or water heater contamination.

Various methods exist to treat sulfur in water. These methods include
# Use of a [[Carbon_filtering|Carbon Filter]] (useful for very small amounts of hydrogen sulfide)
# Filtering the water through a canister of manganese oxide coated [[Greensand]]
# [[Water_aeration|Aeration]] of the water
# Treating the water with [[Water_chlorination|chlorine]] (can be used to treat large amounts of hydrogen sulfide)

==Health==
Bathing in water high in sulfur or other minerals for its presumed health benefits is known as [[balneotherapy]].

===Concerns===
According to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drinking water with high levels of sulfate can cause diarrhea, especially in infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cervin|first1=Michael|title=Sulfur Springs: To Soak or not to Soak?|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/10/08/sulfur-springs-to-soak-or-not-to-soak/|accessdate=24 February 2015|agency=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Faith Healers''''' is a 1987 book by magician and skeptic [[James Randi]] with a foreword by [[Carl Sagan]], that documents Randi's exploration of the world of [[faith healing]], and his exposing the [[sleight of hand]] trickery and deceit by its practitioners.

In eighteen chapters Randi explores the origins of faith healing and [[psychic surgery]], and critically analyzes the claims made by [[A. A. Allen]], [[Ernest Angley]], [[Willard Fuller]], [[WV Grant]], [[Peter Popoff]], [[Oral Roberts]], [[Pat Robertson]], and [[Ralph DiOrio]] for his claims of miracles at the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]] in the town of [[Lourdes]]. Randi shows how people are tricked with [[Magician (illusion)|magician's]] tricks under the guise of religion.

In 1988, Earl Hautala in a review wrote "an eye opener for the naïve, this book provides a crash course in the methods of skeptical inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;Hautala, Earl. (1988). ''The Faith Healers by James Randi''. [[Institute of General Semantics|ETC: A Review of General Semantics]]. Vol. 45, No. 2. p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New Scientist]]'' praised the book in a 1990 review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12517045.300-money-for-old-soap--review-of-the-faith-healers-by-jamesrandi-.html | title=Money for old soap / Review of 'The Faith Healers' | newspaper=[[New Scientist]] | date= 17 February 1990 | first=Roy | last=Herbert | accessdate =2007-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''triptych''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|ɪ|p|t|ɪ|k}} {{respell|TRIP|tik}}; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] adjective ''τρίπτυχον'' "''triptukhon''" ("three-fold"), from ''tri'', i.e., "three" and ''ptysso'', i.e., "to fold" or ''ptyx'', i.e., "fold")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=triptych|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=triptych&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|tri/ptuxos|τρίπτυχον|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a work of [[art]] (usually a [[panel painting]]) that is divided into three sections, or three [[Wood carving|carved]] panels that are hinged together and can be folded shut or displayed open. It is therefore a type of [[polyptych]], the term for all multi-panel works. The middle panel is typically the largest and it is flanked by two smaller related works, although there are triptychs of equal-sized panels. The form can also be used for [[pendant]] jewelry.

Despite its connection to an art format, the term is sometimes used more generally to connote anything with three parts, particularly if they are integrated into a single unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/triptych |title=Triptych |quote=Although triptych originally described a specific type of Roman writing tablet that had three hinged sections, it is not surprising that the idea was generalized first to a type of painting, and then to anything composed of three parts. |work=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
[[File:Verdun Altar.JPG|thumb|The Verdun Altar in [[Klosterneuburg Monastery]]]]
The triptych form arises from early Christian art, and was a popular standard format for altar paintings from the Middle Ages onwards. Its geographical range was from the eastern [[Byzantine]] churches to the Celtic churches in the west. During the Byzantine period, tryptichs were often used for private devotional use, along with other relics such as icons.&lt;ref&gt;2014. ''History of the World in 1,000 Objects.''London, New York. [[Dorling Kindersley|D.K. Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt;Renaissance painters such as [[Hans Memling]] and [[Hieronymus Bosch]] used the form. Sculptors also used it. Triptych forms also allow ease of transport.

From the [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] period onward, both in Europe and elsewhere, altarpieces in churches and cathedrals were often in triptych form. One such cathedral with an altarpiece triptych is [[Llandaff Cathedral]]. The [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Our Lady]] in [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]], Belgium, contains two examples by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], and [[Notre Dame de Paris]] is another example of the use of triptych in architecture. One can also see the form echoed by the structure of many ecclesiastical [[stained glass window]]s. Although strongly identified as an [[altarpiece]] form, triptychs outside that context have been created, some of the best-known examples being works by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[Max Beckmann]], and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]].

The then highest price ever paid for an artwork at auction was $142.4 million for a 1969 triptych, ''[[Three Studies of Lucian Freud]]'', by [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vogel|first=Carol|title=Bacon's Study of Freud Sells for $142.4 Million|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 12, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/arts/design/bacons-study-of-freud-sells-for-more-than-142-million.html|accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record was broken in May 2015 by $179.4 million for [[Pablo Picasso]]'s 1955 painting ''[[Les Femmes d’Alger]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://digg.com/2015/modigliani-nu-couche-140-million A History Of Insane Art Prices] Digg.com Retrieved 16 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The format has migrated and been used in other religions, including [[Islam]] and [[Buddhism]]. For example: the triptych ''Hilje-j-Sherif'' displayed at the [[National Museum of Oriental Art]], Rome, Italy, and a page of the ''[[Qur'an]]'' at the [[Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum|Museum of Turkish and Islamic Arts]] in Istanbul, Turkey, exemplify [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] religious art adapting the motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Museum With No Frontiers]] |publisher=Museum With No Frontiers, Arab Institute for Research and Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gA3dSlLBG38C&amp;pg=PA258&amp;lpg=PA258&amp;dq=islamic+triptych&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sCWXu3Zrse&amp;sig=Hm07LC4FwEbcecVNBxv6KRSBkvQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD0ufi2eTRAhVB7YMKHSkICIgQ6AEIODAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=islamic%20triptych&amp;f=false |location=Brussels, Belgium, Beirut, Lebanon |year=2007 |title=Discover Islamic Art in the Mediterranean |page=258 |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, Tibetan Buddhists have used it in traditional altars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.amazon.com/Tibetan-Buddhist-Altars-Gallery-Traditional/dp/1577314670/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1577314670&amp;pd_rd_r=5ZSFCH5ZDKR1R8YFWHXK&amp;pd_rd_w=jTPLw&amp;pd_rd_wg=Y0eb9&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=5ZSFCH5ZDKR1R8YFWHXK |title=Tibetan Buddhist Altars: A Pop-Up Gallery of Traditional Art and Wisdom |type=Hardcover |first1=Tad |last1=Wise |first2=Robert |last2=Beers |first3=David A. |last3=Carter |publisher=[[New World Library]]  |date=August 25, 2004 |ISBN=978-1577314677 |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15365">[[File:The Southern Milky Way Above ALMA.jpg|thumb|Some of the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] radio telescopes.]]
[[File:Smithsonian Submillimeter Array.jpg|thumb|The eight radio telescopes of the Smithsonian [[Submillimeter Array]], located at the [[Mauna Kea Observatory]] in Hawai'i.]]

'''Very-long-baseline interferometry''' ('''VLBI''') is a type of [[astronomical interferometer|astronomical interferometry]] used in [[radio astronomy]]. In VLBI a signal from an [[astronomical radio source]], such as a [[quasar]], is collected at multiple radio telescopes on Earth. The distance between the radio telescopes is then calculated using the time difference between the arrivals of the radio signal at different telescopes. This allows observations of an object that are made simultaneously by many radio telescopes to be combined, emulating a telescope with a size equal to the maximum separation between the telescopes.

Data received at each antenna in the array include arrival times from a local [[atomic clock]], such as a [[hydrogen maser]].  At a later time, the data are correlated with data from other antennas that recorded the same radio signal, to produce the resulting image.  The resolution achievable using interferometry is proportional to the observing frequency.  The VLBI technique enables the distance between telescopes to be much greater than that possible with conventional [[interferometry]], which requires antennas to be physically connected by [[coaxial cable]], [[waveguide]], [[optical fiber]], or other type of [[transmission line]]. The greater telescope separations are possible in VLBI due to the development of the [[closure phase]] imaging technique by [[Roger Clifton Jennison|Roger Jennison]] in the 1950s, allowing VLBI to produce images with superior resolution.

VLBI is best known for imaging distant cosmic radio sources, spacecraft tracking, and for applications in [[astrometry]].  However, since the VLBI technique measures the time differences between the arrival of radio waves at separate antennas, it can also be used "in reverse" to perform earth rotation studies, map movements of [[tectonic plate]]s very precisely (within millimetres), and perform other types of [[geodesy]].  Using VLBI in this manner requires large numbers of time difference measurements from distant sources (such as [[quasar]]s) observed with a global network of antennas over a period of time.

== Scientific results ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
[[File:Very Long Baseline Interferometry.ogv|thumb|350px|Geodesist Chopo Ma explains some of the geodetic uses of VLBI.]]

Some of the scientific results derived from VLBI include:

*High resolution radio imaging of cosmic radio sources.
*Imaging the surfaces of nearby stars at radio wavelengths (see also [[astronomical interferometer|interferometry]]) &amp;ndash; similar techniques have also been used to make infrared and optical images of stellar surfaces
*Definition of the [[International Celestial Reference Frame|celestial reference frame]]
*Motion of the Earth's tectonic plates
*Regional deformation and local uplift or subsidence.
*Variations in the Earth's orientation and length of day.
*Maintenance of the terrestrial reference frame
*Measurement of [[gravitational force]]s of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] on the Earth and the deep structure of the Earth
*Improvement of atmospheric models
*Measurement of the fundamental [[speed of gravity]]
*The tracking of the [[Huygens probe]] as it passed through [[Titan (moon)|Titan's]] atmosphere, allowing wind velocity measurements

== VLBI arrays ==
There are several VLBI arrays located in [[Europe]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], and [[Australia]]. The most sensitive VLBI array in the world is the [[European VLBI Network]] (EVN). This is a part-time array that brings together the largest European radiotelescopes for typically weeklong sessions, with the data being processed at the [[Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe]] (JIVE). The [[Very Long Baseline Array]] (VLBA), which uses ten dedicated, 25-meter telescopes spanning 5351 miles across the United States, is the largest VLBI array that operates all year round as both an astronomical and [[geodesy]] instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrao.edu/index.php/about/facilities/vlba |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611150939/https://www.nrao.edu/index.php/about/facilities/vlba |archivedate=June 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of the EVN and VLBA is known as [[Global VLBI]]. When one or both of these arrays are combined with space-based VLBI antennas such as [[HALCA]] or RadioAstron ([[Spektr-R]]), the resolution obtained is higher than any other astronomical instrument, capable of imaging the sky with a level of detail measured in [[microarcsecond]]s. VLBI generally benefits from the longer baselines afforded by international collaboration, with a notable early example in 1976, when radio telescopes in the United States, USSR and [[Australia]] were linked to observe [[hydroxyl-maser]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;First Global Radio Telescope, Sov. Astron., Oct 1976&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is currently being used by the [[Event Horizon Telescope]], whose goal is to observe the [[supermassive black holes]] at the centers of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] and [[Messier 87]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Webb |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35258378 |title=Event horizon snapshot due in 2017 |work=BBC News |date=8 January 2016 |accessdate=2017-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lower resolution image on the left image was taken with the UK's MERLIN array and shows the shell of [[maser]] emission produced by an expanding shell of gas with a diameter about 200 times that of the [[Solar System]]. The shell of gas was ejected from a supergiant star (10 times the mass of our sun) at the centre of the emission about 900 years ago. The corresponding EVN e-VLBI image (right) shows the much finer structure of the masers because of the higher resolution of the VLBI array.]]

VLBI has traditionally operated by recording the signal at each telescope on [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]]s or [[Hard disk drive|disk]]s, and shipping those to the correlation center for replay. Recently, it has become possible to connect VLBI radio telescopes in close to real-time, while still employing the local time references of the VLBI technique, in a technique known as '''e-VLBI'''. In Europe, six [[radio telescopes]] of the [[European VLBI Network| European VLBI Network (EVN)]] are now connected with Gigabit per second links via their National Research Networks and the Pan-European research network [[GEANT2]], and the first astronomical experiments using this new technique were successfully conducted in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jive.nl/astronomers-demonstrate-global-internet-telescope | title=Astronomers Demonstrate a Global Internet Telescope | accessdate=2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image to the right shows the first science produced by the European VLBI Network using e-VLBI. The data from 6 telescopes were processed in real time at the European Data Processing centre at [[Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe|JIVE]]. The Netherlands Academic Research Network SURFnet provides 6 x 1 Gbit/s connectivity between JIVE and the GEANT2 network.

== Space VLBI ==

In the quest for even greater angular resolution, dedicated VLBI satellites have been placed in Earth orbit to provide greatly extended baselines. Experiments incorporating such space-borne array elements are termed Space Very Long Baseline Interferometry (SVLBI).

The first space VLBI experiment was on [[Salyut-6]] orbital station with KRT-10 ([[:ru:КРТ-10]]), a 10-meter radio telescope, which was launched in July 1978.

The first such dedicated VLBI mission was [[HALCA]], an 8-meter [[radio telescope]], which was launched in February 1997 and made observations until October 2003, but due to the small size of the dish only very strong radio sources could be observed with SVLBI arrays incorporating it.

Another space VLBI mission, [[Spektr-R|Spektr-R (or RadioAstron)]], was launched in July 2011. The Radioastron project is a radiointerferometer composed of the Spectrum-R space telescope and terrestrial radio telescopes. The orbit height of the Spectrum-R is 390 thousand km, which makes it the longest radiointerferometer to date. The resolution of the system will reach 8 microseconds of the arc.

== How VLBI works ==
[[Image:Recording data at each of the telescopes in a VLBI array.gif|thumb|350px|Recording data at each of the telescopes in a VLBI array. Extremely accurate high-frequency clocks are recorded alongside the astronomical data in order to help get the synchronization correct]]

In VLBI interferometry, the digitized antenna data are usually recorded at each of the telescopes (in the past this was done on large magnetic tapes, but nowadays it is usually done on large arrays of computer disk drives). The antenna signal is sampled with an extremely precise and stable atomic clock (usually a hydrogen [[maser]]) that is additionally locked onto a GPS time standard. Alongside the astronomical data samples, the output of this clock is recorded on the tape/disk media. The recorded media are then transported to a central location. More recent experiments have been conducted with "electronic" VLBI (e-VLBI) where the data are sent by fibre-optics (e.g., 10 Gbit/s fiber-optic paths in the European [[GEANT2]] research network) and not recorded at the telescopes, speeding up and simplifying the observing process significantly. 
Even though the data rates are very high, the data can be sent over normal Internet connections taking advantage of the fact that many of the international high speed networks have significant spare capacity at present.

At the location of the '''correlator''' the data are played back. The timing of the playback is adjusted according to the atomic clock signals on the (tapes/disk drives/fibre optic signal), and the estimated times of arrival of the radio signal at each of the telescopes. A range of playback timings over a range of nanoseconds are usually tested until the correct timing is found.

[[File:Vlbi data playback 2.gif|thumb|350px|Playing back the data from each of the telescopes in a VLBI array. Great care must be taken to synchronize the play back of the data from different telescopes. [[Atomic clock]] signals recorded with the data help in getting the timing correct.]]

Each antenna will be a different distance from the radio source, and as with the short baseline radio [[interferometer]]  the delays incurred by the extra distance to one antenna must be added artificially to the signals received at each of the other antennas. The approximate delay required can be calculated from the geometry of the problem. The tape playback is synchronized using the recorded signals from the atomic clocks as time references, as shown in the drawing on the right. If the position of the antennas is not known to sufficient accuracy or atmospheric effects are significant, fine adjustments to the delays must be made until interference fringes are detected. If the signal from antenna A is taken as the reference, inaccuracies in the delay will lead to errors &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{B}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{C}&lt;/math&gt; in the phases of the signals from tapes B and C respectively (see drawing on right). As a result of these errors the phase of the complex visibility cannot be measured with a very-long-baseline interferometer.

The phase of the complex visibility depends on the symmetry of the source brightness distribution. Any brightness distribution can be written as the sum of a [[symmetric component]] and an [[anti-symmetric component]]. The symmetric component of the brightness distribution only contributes to the real part of the complex visibility, while the anti-symmetric component only contributes to the imaginary part. As the phase of each complex visibility measurement cannot be determined with a very-long-baseline interferometer the symmetry of the corresponding contribution to the source brightness distributions is not known.

[[Roger Clifton Jennison|R. C. Jennison]] developed a novel technique for obtaining information about visibility phases when delay errors are present, using an observable called the [[closure phase]]. Although his initial laboratory measurements of closure phase had been done at optical wavelengths, he foresaw greater potential for his technique in radio interferometry. In 1958 he demonstrated its effectiveness with a radio interferometer, but it only became widely used for long-baseline radio interferometry in 1974. At least three antennas are required. This method was used for the first VLBI measurements, and a modified form of this approach ("Self-Calibration") is still used today.
